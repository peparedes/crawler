"event","The events of the past week have prompted a close re-examination of these journals on my part.  As I am certain you are all fully cognizant of and no doubt ecstatic about, the <i>chaos</i> and <i>anarchy</i> of the past month's proceedings have culminated in Cornelius Fudge's gracious and noble abdication of his position of Minister for Magic, now officially replaced by former head of the DoMLE, Amelia Bones, who has assured me that my position as Junior Assistant is intact, should I wish it.

I must admit to surprise at the lack of ananda here; however, I suppose the circle of positive reinforcement was already so smugly certain of its righteousness that these <i>historic</i> and <i>consequential</i> events seem as no more than the natural course of things.  Or perhaps celebration is occurring, but shielded from the eyes of one such as myself.  Oh yes, I am <i>well</i> aware that discussions occur here to which I am not privy, for certainly, it is ludicrous to assume that these ""Order"" journals consist of little more than ruminations on personal affairs.  (Then, if such is indeed the case, one might wonder at the shame that such concealment would indicate.)

Indeed, it is this circle I wish to address with this post.  For going on six months now have I been Ministry Liaison, and to look back on my first posting is an exercise in retrospective irony.  Optimism and strength of purpose were its hallmarks, a sense of eager anticipation and hope for the future's entelechy.  I even said, ""with such like-minded wizards and witches in our company, how can we fail?""  Had I only known then what I do now - that this like-mindedness would in fact be our downfall.

Certainly, you are all now railing in scorn and indignation, the sort of which I have been I have been the near constant recipient in my time here, and indeed, throughout my life.  However, let us examine the facts.  In the time since these journals' inception, what <i>of worldly consequence</i> has been accomplished?  Or rather, since there is but one ""accomplishment"" to be spoken of, what has occurred?

1) Numerous minor incidents resulting in various casualties
2) Large attack upon King's Cross Station (no casualties)
3) Major attack upon Azkaban Prison, with the resulting escape of known Death Eaters (several casualties)
4) Months of internal governmental turmoil, resulting in a trail biased against the defendant from the beginning and ending in the aforementioned coup.

This is not to mention the more personal disappointments of legal threats and the death of a beloved sibling.  He would have been thirty-two last month.

As you can clearly see, the situation has only become steadily worse in these months.  And yet, despite my friendly overtures, I am told time and again by the hegemony here that I should abandon my employer with caprice, discard the well-earned trust that I place in him, renounce my entire support system, and fall into step with the rest of the white-winged angels by throwing in my lot with the polyonymous Headmaster Dumbledore.

Pardon my laughter.

Has it occured to anyone that I might have legitimate objections to becoming yet another blind follower?  Yes, legitimate, though I suspect it would take one outside the system to perceive them clearly.

<i>Trust</i> Dumbledore?  How can I?  <i>Why should</i> I?  Place my faith in one whose vaunted merit and leadership has brought nothing but discord and disaster?  When I have been shown no signs of reciprocation, no hints from any of the persons operating under his auspices that my participation would be at all welcome, appreciated, or valued as anything but a tool and drone?  When indeed, my eldest and most looked-up-to brother was murdered while supposedly under his protection?  When his encouragement led the remainder of my siblings to charge blindly into the fray, even knowing that their number was down two by such actions?

Surely you jest.

You wonder at my continued loyalty to Cornelius Fudge; I wonder how I could feel otherwise.  For as long as I can remember, even back to the <i>first</i> time I lost a brother - the Bill to my Charlie, as it were - I have been taught to stand up for my own beliefs, to make my own choices and determine my own direction in life.  And yet, when I do those things now, I am told by the self-same parties that such a course of action is <i>incorrect</i>.

Or is it that the only correct choice is the one with which the society at large agrees?

Wrapped up in your conformity as you are, you cannot see the situation for what it is, which is this: Former Minister Fudge does not insult me.  He does not mock my attention to detail, he does not play cruel tricks, he does not treat me like the black sheep of the Ministry.  He values my input, my work, my advice, my skills and my role in the administration.  

Why am I loyal to him, you ask?  I shall put it in terms all will understand: does one gravitate towards the professor who rewards, or the one who punishes?  We only reap that which we have sown.

It should be clear why the blatant assumption that with my friend deposed, I will easily fall into the line, makes me laugh.

I digress.

But what use is there in my saying this, after all?  You have won.  Dumbledore's hegemony has seized the kingdom, and with it, there is no further need for an intermediary liaison.  Upon my friend Cornelius's recommendation, I am maintaining my postition in the Ministry, however, I hereby withdraw my participation as would-be fogram in this organization.  You needn't bother concealing your celebration this time.

In adieu,
Percy I. Weasley"

"event","I suppose I might as well give some description of yesterday's events despite the public record, given response to my prior posting.  My testimony yesterday proceeded much as I expected.  

The Prosecution continued to probe their questionable charges; having been in attendance, I was eminently familiar with the material already and competent to respond to their allegations, which seem to me no more than subjective character opinions and warped and ommissive ""facts"". 

My personal favourite part was the Defense's examination, wherein I was given liberty to reiterate that which I have stated here and elswhere numerous times: that the Minister has always and continues to exercise his best judgment given the concrete information available to him; that rather than blaming him for being unaware of facts we should instead work to remedy those uncommunicative links; that perspective is of utmost importance; that putting fault on the current administration for works of those past is short-sighted and vindictive.  I feel my words made a significant impact on those present, and I feel proud of my actions taken in support of Minister Fudge.

I shall not be in attendance today, however, due to Ministry business requiring my presence.

Conclusively,

"event","Well!  The past two weeks have undoubtedly some of the more memorable of my career thus far.  I have been in attendance at the trial, at Minister Fudge's behest, every day without fail, and though I maintain that this particular injunction is a frivolous waste of governmental time and Galleons, I feel confident that its slanderous origins shall be turned over, resulting instead in its becoming known to history as a great triumph of Cornelius Fudge's Ministry.  The Prosecution overinflates to bursting such miniscule and macedoine pseudo-evidence as it can imagine, and the Defense most admirably employs logic, reason, and the law in exonerating our Honourable Head of State.  The magisterial body can have no illusions as to which party is in the wrong and shall certainly exact condign reprisal.

My own testimonial is scheduled for early next week.  I anticipate it with good faith and welcome the opportunity to support my employer and offer my unique perspective as his protege.  To those who have yet to sit in the witness's stand, I encourage you not to eye the venerable chair with trepidation; rather, take pride in the gift given to you, and above all, to thine own self, be veridical.

"event","I am on an enforced hiatus at the moment and have at last had the opportunity to view the journal entries posted since the...Monday.

For all my vocabulary, words cannot begin to describe my reaction to learning that Hogwarts students were involved in...this.  <i>Children</i>.  My god.  And yet I am more amazed to find that this behaviour is not only sanctioned, it is <i>approbated</i>.  Certainly, one might declare all actions to have been well and warranted after the fact, but suppose one or more of these so-called brave, more accurately termed reckless, witches or wizards in training had perished?  What then?  Shall we place all our hopes on a ""positive"" outcome in our actions, damn the consequences lest they fail?  

This matter shall not go unnoticed, I assure you.  Were the wizarding populace to learn of this attitude at the location where they send their children for <i>protection</i>...But no more.  

(It would, of course, be pointless to ask my siblings <i>what on earth they were thinking</i> taking on such action, particularly considering their unique histories.)

I have said before, and yet I maintain, the course we can no longer fail to take is that of full disclosure and cooperation with Minister Fudge's government.  The time for secret societies, dalliances, negotiations, games, and trivialities is ended.  We <i>must</i> pool <i>all</i> our resources in order to show a united coalition.  The Minister requires each and every one of you to show him your loyalty, to reassure our troubled society and demonstrate that together, we shall defend them from this enemy.  With the full force of our opposition under one leading voice, we cannot fail.

I must return to work.  I do not anticipate a great deal of liberty to peruse these journals in the coming week, nor even much time to engage with Hypnos, as once the battle is ended, the masses must be quelled.

"event","A most enlightening incident occured this week, and, if the information it imparts is not crucial, it is at least of interest.  As I was out in Muggle London on errand, I came across a Muggle seated outside a cafe, using a laptop computer.  Curious, I peered over his shoulder to glimpse the screen.  I saw the symbol in the upper right corner, indicating that he, too, was making use of the ""Internet"".  He was not, however, utilizing a LiveJournal.  As I observed further, it appeared he was sending and receiving messages, almost instantaneously from the swiftness of the replies, yet without having to return to view the last he posted.  Most intriguing!  Continuing to watch, I noticed that he, on occasion, would put his cursor on an underlined blue word or string of characters, which would subsequently generate a new display showing somethinge entirely different.  

Fascinated as I was, I did not notice when he started to become aware of my gaze until he turned his head fully around and regarded me rather rudely.  I gathered that I had made some unconscious breach of Muggle etiquette, made my apologies, and continued on my errand.  However, I kept in my mind the logos I saw on his display for further investigation when I could return to my own machine.

Did you know that these journals are actually on a vast network known as the ""World Wide Web""?  Indeed, it is an apt metaphor; we ourselves are the spiders, crawling along the individual strands and occasionally following a junction off to an entirely new territory.  I learned that the primary activity in which he engaged is known as ""electronic mail"", or ""e-mail"", and, as I have explained previously to my sister Ginny, I found the logo I had previously seen and obtained for myself an ""e-mail address"", which can now be seen in my profile.  (If anyone else so desires, I would be more than happy to assist in the creation of your such own address.)  From thence, I was led to an automatic ""search"" utility.  My innocent query returned many thousands of ""hits"" (a rather distressing term, actually).  I am now subscribed to an amusing newsletter known as ""A Word A Day"".  Yesterday's word of interest was shivaree.  

I shall endeavour to utilize it in conversation, yet I fear the opportunity may not present itself for quite some time, here at the office.  Celebration is the last thing on anyone's mind these days.  I shall say no more, except that I am putting together a report on the many astounding functions of this Internet so that they can perhaps one day be taken advantage of by the wizarding world.  Minister Fudge will surely be eager for a more optimistic project once his current troubles are over.

"event","First, I must apologise to the Order of the Phoenix.  I have been remiss in my liaison's duties on these journals; it is terribly easy to be led wayward by personal concerns that matter little in the world at large.

Accordingly, I shall now provide an updated report on the status of the Ministry, where I have passed nearly all of my time since returning from my assignment.

The unfortunate incident at King's Cross has brought a new wave of correspondence to the Minister's office.  We are sending replies as quickly as quills can compose them, and yet we remain inundated.  The press are not aiding us in this, as the Minister's attempted conference this morning demonstrated.  Their constant, largely irrelevant questions prevented him or his aides from delivering the full report as outlined previously by the Junior Assistant.  

More worryingly, there is unrest within the Ministry, particularly in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement - surely the last place one would desire contention, particularly now.  I might speculate that changes within their ranks are fostering the instability.  A remembrance of one's duty is crucial in times of crisis.  Needless to say, the whisperings and machinations are not helping Minister Fudge perform his.

In sum, I ask you all to recall the importance of unity in triumphing over one's, for lack of a better word, enemies.  I request that we all give our full support to Minister Fudge, who, though rising admirably to the challenge, certainly shall not succeed without it.

Dutifully,

"event","One might expect a dinner engagement with one's elder brothers to be a pleasant, or at least a cordial, experience.  One might envision passing the hours in amicable conversation regarding personal and world affairs, literature and the arts, topped off with a dash of humour and good spirits.  Indeed, one might wish for such an evening, even rearrange one's increasingly busy schedule in anticipation.

However, one learns, in life, to expect disappointment, or at least to deal with it should it come to pass.

Though my preparations for my rapidly approaching departure grow ever-more pressing, I was quite willing to postpone them just a bit longer that I might enjoy such an evening.  Alas, it was not to be.  Despite having expressed interest in the engagement <i>himself</i>, my eldest brother was nowhere to be seen when I arrived, nor did he make an appearance at all whilst we were there, not even in the form of an owled or journaled excuse.

Charlie and I endeavoured to make the best of our lessened trio, but Bill's absense set the mood for the entire evening.  Our attempts at conversation revealed differences of opinion that I do not anticipate being reconciled in the near future.  To prevent a public scene (for, as you know, one in such a prominent governmental position such as mine must be constantly aware of the image he presents to the world, whether in the line of duty or outside), I took my leave of the establishment.  

My evening since my return to my flat has been vastly more productive.

Though we all of us have little life outside of work these days, there seemed to be an unspoken agreement to leave business behind and simply enjoy ourselves for an evening.

An intelligent young witch, she asked me to meet her at the Leaky Cauldron before venturing towards our chosen venue, Incendio.  I had not previously patronised said establishment, but I found the ambiance soothing and the food most satisfactory.

Perhaps it was reflection on another year gone by or musings on new experiences to be gained in the coming one, but Ginny seemed less inclined to chat this evening than is her usual wont.  She was more interested in listening to my tales of work, particularly my upcoming extended assignment (and no, I still cannot tell you whence I am going - top secret, eyes only, and all that).  I do not believe it would be immodest to say that she enjoyed my gift to her, chosen in light of her recent creative explorations.  

Her excitement reached its pinnacle, however, when I offered a post-meal visit to my humble abode, in which she had previously expressed interest.  I passed much of yesterday evening applying scouring charms to every square centimetre so that it would be fit for guests, as I do not often entertain.  She seemed most delighted in the visit, though I confess I do not know what could have sparked such a reaction.  It is, as I said, a humble abode that suits my needs.  It is also, however, connected to the Floo Network, so she was able to safely venture home from there.

I need not reiterate the busy state of my employment, however, I succeeded in making time this evening for a social engagement with an associate.  My personal penchant for a certain flavour at Florean Fortescue's lent the setting, and a coincidence in schedules lent the time.

The meeting was perhaps briefer than I could have wished, yet not entirely regretfully so.  We were able to reacquaint ourselves with one another's affairs, both public and private.  I was most pleased to find her well, as I must admit to some concern in that department of late.  Of course, all I can do is my duty in listening and offering words of advice where warranted.  We discussed subjects of mutual interest, and I daresay I provided her with something more for which she was most thankful.

I am certain your abrupt departure did nothing to quell the attendees' fears, as I was besieged with a great many questions about the Ministry's plans and precautions following your leave-taking.

I must admit to my surprise upon finding this ""Live Journal"" invitation in my morning post upon my arrival at the Ministry.  Such an intriguing concept, and, if I may, from such an unexpected quarter!  I soon realised, however, that Headmaster Dumbledore's motives in requesting my appearance here only reflect a new spirit in these troubled times; the Ministry, too, is eager to unite and move forward together, rather than suffering yet more from division and discord.  

I am certain I speak for my superiors in applauding this gesture.  I am most delighted to have been chosen as the particular link in our newly forged chain (and, if I may be so bold, I clearly discern the reasoning for said choice, with my prior status as a Hogwarts head student).  I look forward not only to providing means of communication among all of us who wish to see evil defeated, but also to reacquainting myself with all of you with whom I previously have had relations - and forming new alliances with those whom I did not!

I shall have to conclude shortly; as you may well imagine, work, or rather, life at the Ministry these days is unceasingly busy.  There is much to be done in reassuring the public, and Minister Fudge is in constant need of my assistance.  However, the words I read here lift my spirits - with such like-minded wizards and witches in our company, how can we fail?

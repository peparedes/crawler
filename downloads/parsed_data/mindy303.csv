"event","hmm.  what is love? it seems to me that alot of people confuse it with infatuation or lust.  i love joey with everything i have, but that has roots deeply embedded from girlhood.  i guess at the end of the day love is excepting the person your with for who they are.  excepting all of their flaws and loving them anyway.  
 i wonder why some people have a pull to them.  why sometimes we're drawn to people even if we cant have them.  for some reason ive never really had this problem, but ive witnessed it.  i have been drawn to someone, but hes now my boyfriend so i dont have to worry about the cant have part.  but ive watched a perfectly intelligent friend like the same person over and over knowing they can never have them.  what is it about those special few that has such a strong pull?  its just something ive been pondering on today."

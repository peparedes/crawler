"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6600cc>This journal is so gay, I have no cool lil feature things or anything... how fucking retarded... HONESTLY! Yeah so anyways... I am just sitting here bored. Thinking about lots of things... like why do ugly ppl exsist? I mean I have seen like TONS of ugly ppl on TV&nbsp;its so annoying. I swear to God, the most annoying thing about the WHOLE internet is Pop-Ups I hate them with a passion, there so fucking stupid. Also I hate the stupid fucking lil square things that come up on the right of my screen for notifications of AIM users. Its so GAY! For real! I hate this journal I thought it would be all cute and shit, but its not at all! I hate it... but oh well. Its something to talk to I guess, and aware ppl of how I am feeling... LOL Well tomorrow should be somewhat of a good day, I am going to go to Alecia's bday party, and go swimming, I hope its nice out tomorrow, it pry won't be just cuz I want it to be. I hate that shit. Hopefully tho, I have my fingers crossed. But yeah so, I am bored. I hate this thing!! I want it to be cute, and sweet but its not, its so fucking plain and gay!! Fuck this shit!! I don't even have a picture on it.. which I should. My computer is so fucked up, it has so much shit on it. I have to go to the FUCKING doctor tomorrow BRIGHT and EARLY! Yippee fucking skippee! NOT! I hate the doctors it makes me so nervous, and cold. I hate it. Sitting on the cold table. EWW.. it gives me the chills just thinking about it. But my eye has been really gay lately. I hate eyes, can't they just be normal. I don't get it. Oh well. I need some sleep or something, I am so bitchy and annoyed. Hopefully tomorrow is a better day! Much love. </FONT></STRONG></P>

I went sea dooing with my bro Todd, and his</STRONG> <STRONG><U>HOTT</U></STRONG> <STRONG>friend Jimmy. It was fucking awesome, I loved it. I rode with Jimmy, and my friend Becky went and she rode with Todd, it was so cool. Anyways Jimmy dumped me off the sea doo like 384759238745 times. LOL And it was fun, we swam around in Wolf Lake too, it was cool and warm. After that we all came back to my house and ate pizza, Bernie and Adam met us at the lake too, it was fun. Anyways we ate pizza at my house and I bought both boxes and ate like 5 peices. LOL Oh well I'm gonna get fat anyways. Yeah oh well tho. LOL Later when me and Becky came back here, we went to Northway and bowled a game, we sucked at bowling and we lost, LOL. Lowest score... oh well! LOL So I had a pretty good day ya know...! I am really starting to enjoy summer a lil more and more, thanks to my brother. He's the awesomest bro ever. He's cool, and I'm glad that he likes to include me in things all the time. But yeah, I have to get offline. So more later. Much Love* MUAH!</STRONG></FONT></P>

"event","What is up with this Phantom CRAZE!!?? It's great, but it seems like everyone is always watching, listening to, or singing it. I'ts drivin' me nuts, Mainly because I'm a musical theatre student and I know of so many more musicals that are 34047073 times better, all it takes is just a little research and you too could be familiar with wonderful musicals like: Wicked, Man of La Mancha, I love you you're perfect now change, Godspell, Into the woods, The Lion King, or Nine, just to name a few. I like Phantom too, It may be one of the only Webber musicals I do like, but there is a danger of becoming burnt out if you concentrate on one musical for  too long, Take it from me!
Anyway, Everything is fine. I had to vent. I love you all."

He came to visit me here in Palatka, brought me flowers, balloons,two presents, and a card; I had the stomach virus and could not hold anything down. GREEEEAAAAAATTTTTT. He took care of me and nursed me back to health. I have the best boyfriend on the face of the Earth. I'm so silly in love.
Anyway,he had to leave wednesday. I was better by the time he left. So I did the college thing for a couple of days and then had to leave for OP. I went to Gainesville and picked Stephen up because we had to help with my churches VBS last weekend and we met up with the wonderful and talented CJ along with the very funny Paul, two of the best people in the world.
We visited the Casbah (Belly dancing night) as a late anniversary gift to Stephen. We Had a great time and spent the rest of the weekend helping out my church.
While at Cj's house, I discovered that Doug is coming to FloArts. Yeah, I had no Idea. I don't know why I was so oblivious the last few weeks of school, but there it is.
It should be fun to have someone from high School here at FloArts. 
So yeah, I have to go take a test. CAN'T WAIT!

*Haven't been called for work. My job is great, I'd get 6.50 an hour...If I had hours...CALL ME NANCY, I NEED MONEY!!
*Hardly studied for my SAT. I guess that it's somewhat like CJ and going to class. I meant to, but just didn't.
*My little brother turned 12 friday. EEEK! The fact that he's gonna have a horrible middle schooler attitude scares me. 
*went to gainesville and picked up this wonderful guy, with whom I spent the entire weekend. He keeps telling me that his name is ""Boyfriend"". What kinda name is that!
Gotta love him, he's great.
*Went to bed really late the night before my SAT which was really not smart.
*Took my SAT. It was a lot easier than I thought it would be.
*One of my best friends got into a car accident. I love you Jennifer!
*I spent more time with my loving Boyfriend.
*I went to church. My Dad preached a great sermon (Thank you inspiration of God!)
*watched school of rock numberous times over the whole weekend.
*I'm pumped about state!!!
*Started to rehearse my monologues.

And that brings me to yesterday. I had a great day all day. I skipped 6th period and went to smoothie king with stephen and had a wonderful smoothie. Immune builders are the b-o-m-b!
we came back for the Scatter the Dreams rehearsal. I got a great part. Although I don't think that I desurve it,I will do my best and plus, It will look great on my college resume. Niccce. 

Today is great! Although I'm really tired. I'm gonna go shopping.

 I spent time with my family and especially my boyfriend.
(Sometimes he spends the weekend at my house) I'm really glad my family loves him. It's kinda funny that my dad seems more relaxed when around my boyfriend, It's almost like they are friends. Except for the fact that he is dating me and my dad instictively keeps an eye on him. 
This weekend with Stephen had a different feel to it compared to every other weekend we've spent together. It kinda felt like we were a married couple coming home, which is kinda freaky now that I look at it, but the feeling was very warm and relaxing. I felt very content. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm definately not thinking about marriage(partly because I have so much ahead of me in the next couple of years...Mainly because I am 17 and If you're seriously thinking about marriage at my age in our society...extremely disturbing) but its atmosphere was there none-the-less.
I like the way my life is going right now. It's very busy, but I feel accomplished, and I definately have organization that wasn't there before.
I drank a can of V8 juice. It was extremely nasty for the first couple of seconds, but then the feeling that I was doing something good for my body took over.

I got to check in late to school because he was also leaving at around 11:30am. so he took me to school around 9:15 on his crazy cool motorcycle...SWEET!
I couldn't concentrate much on my school work so I just kinda sat through the classes I had to go to. I got out of two of my classes because the teachers didn't feel like teaching.
so I sat in Mrs. McCall's room watching blazing saddles and it somewhat cheered me up...for a while. I came home and ate and wanted to loose consciousness so I went to bed...took about a three or four hour nap. Then went to go see the Passion of the Christ, which is a great, and again, an emotionally draining movie. 
It's even more emotional for Christians because we know that Jesus suffered that much for us.

BUT, if THEY are tried for double homicide, the mothers who willingly murder their unborn children should be charged as well. I have decided that I am against charging murderers for double homicide in this case, UNLESS, women who get abortions are tried for murder too.

There are absolutely no words to describe what I saw last night. Except,It was the best piece of art that I have ever seen. Everything was beautiful beyond belief.
 It's a play about what is expected of each sex in the (world wide) society and the battle between the sexes. I had never thought so deeply on the subject before and I walked away with a better view of life. 
I have always been In love with Theatre, but this production deepened it immensely. I recommend the long drive to Gainesville to anyone going to see this incredible show. It is definitely worth every minute.
*just a warning to anyone who has never seen boobies and butt cheeks before, there is partial nudity in this show*
Now, about audiences everywhere. I have learned that never will there be a completely mature/comfortable audience. So just start to tune them out now.(Unless you're performing on stage)

Greased lightening and We go together) and other parts were just painful to watch (HUGE example-beauty school dropout...HOLY COW) The Dancing was Beautiful. Great Job Natalie! 
One of the Burger Palace boys was extremely Gay, so his character was totally unbelievable to me. That's sad. But the girl who played Rizzo was perfect in her role. Great Job!
After having seen the show, and what it takes to be included in the musical theatre program, I am much more comfortable with auditioning there. 
So,this is what I'm thinking about for the audition.
 Monologues- 
   History lesson(one of the monologues I am currently competing with.*I cant wait for state*)
the other one...I have no Idea(i'm gonnna go see Big Love tonight at UF. So hopefully I'll get some ideas from that)
 Solo Musicals-
   What I did for Love-a Chorus Line
   I'm still thinking about another one but It has to be an upbeat number. so, If anyone has any Ideas...post something!
  Dance-
    The dance of the robe-Aida (teehee)
Yeah, so I have to go find another monologue and Song.
Later!

"event","Yeah, so I'm in fourth period right now. We watched a beautiful movie about the stock market in Vance's class. 
I have had a change of interest. I am not going into theatre, which is what I was born to do...I am going to be a STOCK BROKER!!! (Or maybe a really bad actor who pretends to be. He is definitely getting my nomination for the SAG awards!)
Needless to say, after that beautiful piece of artistic genius, I took a field trip to Mrs. McCall's room (My home away from home) It's much better in here. Drama 2 is a VAST improvement from what I just saw. Seriously!
(Upon asking Mrs. McCall what drama class this was, I saw lots of butt crack. This girl was just taking advantage of the wonderful SUPERLOW crotch riding hip huggers that designers make for those skinny girls now. Jealously? Not quite.)
SO. Live Journal has definitely become a huge addiction for me. I think that I may actually be able to keep up a journal for the first time in my life. I should probably be doing something productive, like homework, so I wont have to do it later.
Ok, I talked myself into it.

"event","So, this is my first journal entry. 
It feels nice, lets see how I feel after I get everything out.
so yeah, yesterday I had an ok day all day, and to top it off..I went to dance.
I am dancing to ""The dance of the robe"" from Aida, for my FLOarts audition,
Which is awesome!!! The hard part is that there is no music when it starts out,
it's just Aida (A.K.A Heather Headly) Singing by herself. So I have to pretty much start dancing when she starts singing. FUN!(why do I feel like a dancing monkey?) 
BUT, problem is....I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO SORE IN MY WHOLE LIFE!!! AHHHHHH!
Ok, I take that back, I have...but it hurts.
Anyway, On to the present.
My boyfriend is in the concert band at UF, and he has a concert tonight. I can't go and it's killing me. I wanna be as supportive as possible but I cant, cause someone (namely ME) doesnt have a drivers licence (Which is also preventing me from seeing him this weekend too....NICE) As long as he knows I love him..it's ok.
I'm at the church right now...when am I not? so that's all cause I'm gonna go to bible study.

P.S. Tyler and Cj are such a CUTE COUPLE!
Love ya lezzie!"

Jackson Square</p><p>I&#39;d read about New Orleans for years in various stories and books. Of course it&#39;s difficult to speak of the French Quarter without speaking of Jackson Square. I don&#39;t think photos really do it justice because after all, it is beautiful and full of life. Artists and performers all making a buck and doing what they love. It has a flavor and character like no other I&#39;ve been around in my life.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

 <div><br />Jazz Musician<br /><br />The artists and performers were out and it was just quite lovely. I&#39;m used to street musicians but I&#39;m also used to it being hippies with drums and the occasion guitar. I&#39;m not going to lie, they&#39;re annoying. That&#39;s all together different from the beautiful jazz that filled my ears and made me smile. We&#39;d actually sat and listened to this trio while eating at Cafe Du Monde the previous day and were delighted to see them performing again, they were great.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

</div><div>Chateau Hotel<br /><br />This was where we ended up staying in the quarter. It was beautiful inside and out. What you don&#39;t see is the lovely courtyard, beautiful rooms and staff decked out in black and white to just top it off. I was so happy that we decided to stay in the city and that the people at the visitors center gave us such an amazing deal. What was normally a room going for about $130 a night; we got our room for $50 plus free parking. Definitely go to the visitors center if you&#39;re going to stay in the French Quarter and ask them for their hotel offers. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<br /></div><div><br />Saint Louis #1 <br /><br />The only of the &#39;cities of the dead&#39; we had time to visit. Unfortunately when we got there it wasn&#39;t the best time f day for photography and we were beyond baking in the sun. Still, the quiet beauty in the decaying tombs is definitely something to check out. Winding through was like a maze of crumbling history, which I for one love.<br /><br />Call me morbid but I love a good cemetery. Aesthetically speaking, the older, the better in my opinion. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<br /></div><div><br /><br />Mr. Bojangles<br /><br />That&#39;s what I think of when I see this photograph. We met this guy when we first got to Jackson Square. He just started talking to us, telling us stories of his travels and his life. He was fascinating in both personality and the character on his face. Earlier I&#39;d asked him if it was alright to take his photograph.<br /><br />Later in the day we ran back into him playing the broom with his grandson&#39;s jazz trio. He was so happy and chatting it up with the kids. Syd was hot so he took her into a cafe and got them to give her some water. He was just a gem. Maybe other&#39;s will think I&#39;m insane but really, he MADE the trip.&#160; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<br /></div><div><br /><br />Biloxi Beach<br /><br />Syd had never been to a real beach. That&#39;s what started this whole thing. My nephew was down and had been bragging about getting to go to the beach in a few weeks. My former sister in law finally just told me (after much pouting) that she was covering gas and a room so if we wanted to tag along for a quick trip...we were welcome to. <br /><br />Syd was ecstatic and oh so happy to finally get to go. Her first taste of waves, of sea life and the taste of saltwater in the mouth. She loved it. We found little crabs, shells, a dead sea turtle and jellyfish. Not too much beats that for a young kid. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

First I am going to talk about how this whole thing came about. My nephew was here visiting and several times he had mentioned to my daughter that he was going to the beach. This was to be part of his birthday gift. Of course Sydney wanted to go along and he was somewhat taunting her with it. When his mother came to pick him up, she asked me this...&quot;Hey, I&#39;m taking the kids to Corpus Christie to go to the beach. I&#39;m already paying the gas/hotel so if you and Syd want to go along it&#39;d be really fun.&quot; My mom agreed that we should go along and that she&#39;s watch Simon.</p>

<p>&#160;Well that seemed like some fun. We sat down and started trying to figure up a date to go. She was planning to go after her second pay period of the month but that was after school started. We talked about how long of a drive it would be and then the thought hit me...why not try to go to the beach in Mississippi. We looked up the time it&#39;d take to drive and it was a little less and that&#39;s when we realized...New Orleans was right there...so why not take advantage of that. I&#39;ve wanted to go to New Orleans ever since I was about 16. The week long wait was so long.</p><p>Finally the day was upon us. Syd and I had very little money to play with, just over 100$ but that wasn&#39;t going to stop us. For us it&#39;s more about seeing the sights and absorbing the area. Make no mistake, there is a lot to absorb in New Orleans without spending a huge amount of money. </p>

We were in for a looooong drive in one car with no air conditioning. </p><p>The first few hours went by super fast even though it felt like we were stopping in every town for bathroom breaks and whatnot. We kept encouraging the kids to just go on to sleep but no luck...everyone was far too excited. </p><p>The moon was nearly full which provided great ambient lighting for driving. It had an eerie feeling as well because you could make out scenery here and there way off into the distance without being able to quite make out what it was. bouncing in the car didn&#39;t stop me from trying to take long exposure shots of the road. </p><p>The kids were full of excitement and giddyness which made for a fun drive. It was also at times slightly maddning when we actually had to deal with things like &quot;STOP TOUCHING ME!&quot; Thankfully we didn&#39;t have to deal with the &quot;are we there yet&quot; because I know with mine, I prepared her that we were in for a looooong drive and would be driving basically all night. </p>

<p> Somewhere around 2 am we finally made it out of Arkansas and into Louisiana. I think from there it took us around 45 minutes to get to our halfway point...Shreveport. </p><p>Going through Shreveport was not a joy. First of all everyone needed to make a pit stop. Every place we stopped at had the inside all locked up. Everyone was on the verge of exploding bladders. </p><p>Shreveport is also where Google Maps failed us. Their directions seemed to skip a large portion (a couple hundred miles) of our route. That&#39;s lovely. We followed their directions to never see the highway in which it told us to get on. We finally were able to stop...everyone got some relief and we got a map. Well geez, it would seem we needed to take another highway south through Alexandria and hook up with the highway Google told us to get on several hundred miles south in Lafayette. No problem...we only wasted about 15 minutes total. </p>

The map was also nice in that with various towns and whatnot we could have an idea of how far we had to go. We made it to Alexandria somewhere around 4 am. In the drive from Shreveport to Alexandria basically consisted of us begging the kids to get some sleep. We even went so far as to pop in Sigor Ros for a good hour or so hoping that would lull the kids to sleep. Syd finally fell asleep but as soon as we stopped in Alexandria for a fill up she was wide awake again. </p><p>By this time the adults were running on fumes as well. Now you must remember, I woke up at 8 am ready to go and full of energy. Sara had worked from 10-5 on Tuesday and then run errands before we left. By 4 am we were running on Red Bull and coffee to say the least. </p><p><br />

Halfway between Alexandria and Lafayette dawn was approaching. Now, I&#39;ve not seen the sun rise in quite awhile but this sun rise was absolutely beautiful. I don&#39;t know if we lucked out or if it&#39;s always so misty and gorgous but we were all just blown away. Mist covered everything. I tried and tried to get a ton of photos but we were in a moving car. In the photograph of the early light where it looks like the trees are on water...that&#39;s the mist. </p><p>Dawn did bring a new wind for awhile and we were able to push on for a bit. What was surprising was that by the time we did get to Lafayette it was not near as far to Baton Rouge as how it appeared on the map. Of course just as Sara had decided &quot;as soon as we get to the next turn off we&#39;re pulling over and I&#39;m taking a short 30 minute nap&quot; we realized we were on what felt like a never ending bridge.</p>

The neverending bridge was over Henderson Swamp. I might be a little crazed or whatever but I thought it was very pretty. The kids were all kinds of excited trying to look for gators in the water. Please note that when you&#39;re driving nearly 70 miles per hour on a big bridge that goes on forever and ever you&#39;re likely not to see any gators in the water. That didn&#39;t stop the kids from swearing that they saw one here or there.</p><p>As I previously said, by this time Sara had been driving for hours on no sleep and she was about to die of sleep&#160; deprivation. It was one of those times that the never ending bridge needed to end soon so this woman could get a bit of sleep. Not to mention everyone needed a pit stop. Thankfully the bridge did finally come to an end and we found a huge truck stop...with a tiger.</p><div at:enclosure=""asset"" at:xid=""6a00c2251eed00f219011018607645860f 6a00c2251eed00f219011018607642860f 6a00c2251eed00f2190110164135bc860b"" at:format=""strip-vertical"" at:align=""left"" class=""enclosure enclosure-left enclosure-strip enclosure-strip-vertical""  style=""text-align: center; float: left;"">

<p><br /> <div>When I say that there was a tiger...I&#39;m not kidding. Now the kids were so excited about this tiger but truthfully it was pretty sad. It had a very small enclosure and was all by itself. Syd took several photos of the area and these are the photos I&#39;ve used here. After awhile Syd was feeling very sad for the tiger. <br /><br />We all got a bit of a rest at the truck stop though. Sara kicked her seat back and fell fast asleep. We all decided to take advantage of the time and changed our clothes, put on sunscreen...I put on makeup for some odd reason (I think it was mostly gone before we got on the road). I pulled out some food for the kids to have a bit of breakfast and we all stretched our legs for awhile.<br /><br />After about 30 minutes Sara woke up (probably from the heat) and decided to do herself a favor and go ahead and change and get ready. We weren&#39;t quite an hour from New Orleans at this point (at least it didn&#39;t seem like it). It was maybe an hour...but I want to say something like 50 miles. <br /><br />Of course on our last push is when Syd decided she&#39;d finally fall asleep for more than 10 minutes. We all laughed in that when we could finally see the city we would try to wake her up and she&#39;d just lift up her head for a second...mumble...and pass back out. <br /><br />That&#39;s a kid for ya...<br /><br />To be continued..........<br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></p>

 <div><br />I&#39;m so excited! Syd and I are going to New Orleans and the gulf shore next week! Yay. Yeah we&#39;re all broke so it&#39;ll mainly be walking around and checking out the sites but it&#39;s going to be so dang fun! Syd&#39;s excited to take her camera and snap a ton of photos...and to be honest...that&#39;s what I&#39;m excited about!<br /><br />

She's managed to track one side of the family...and as it turns out...it's very interesting.<br /><br />There's one huge feud that went on for years with some of them way back when in KY. Actually one of them traveled from Pennsylvania to KY with Daniel Boone and settled what was then Logansboro, KY..it was his sons that had this huge blood feud known as the Logan/Tolliver feud.<br /><br />One I believe was secretary to William Penn...<br /><br />Then things get quite interesting. My mom finally got to the point where she'd traced it back to Robert Logan of Restalrig (in Scotland) and from there...she hit pay dirt. I had been looking a few days before for the tartan/crest when I came across a few things. It was her talking about this guy that jogged it in my head b/c I'd already read it. He was hated and terrible...so bad in fact that 2 years after his death his body was exhumed and dragged into court to be tried and convicted. Soooo that's bound to stick out. When she got a hit on that I pointed her to another site that went back farther...and here it is...<br /><br /><span><a href=""http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/htol/logan2.html"">http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/htol/logan2.html</a></span><br /><br />And here's the castle...which is just way cool...it was in Restalrig, just outside of Edinburgh.

We were just always under the impression he came from Irish decent. Probably b/c as we've found out, that the line we come from was eventually driven out of Scotland for refusing to convert from Catholocism...so they had to then go to Ireland. from there they emigrated from Ireland. <br />"

"event","<lj-raw><p>So my mom has become addicted to Ancestry.com. She's managed to trace her mom's side back to the early 1800's so far...and found out some info there. We'd always been told that her grandfather was Scottish by way of Ireland (i.e. lived in Ireland). Come to find out, he was born in Scotland but both of his parents were Irish and they went back to Ireland. So he wasn't Scottish at all...just Irish.</p><p>Then on her father's side she managed to trace that back to 1625. Apparently they're all French...we'd always been told they were Irish/Scotch with a smattering of Chreorkee and maybe French...since we do know there's something about a woman who was French (and we've been told aristocracy) that lived/worked in New Orleans but was run out under some sort of scandal. Interesting what you find out.</p><p>My paternal grandfather's side is easy..they're Alsatian...so German/French...the family lived in that area forever before coming here and building the winery.<br/> </p>

Yeah.

Ups gets it Thursday afternoon...it doesn't leave from new york for about 5 hours...and then it aparently takes another 8 hours to arrive in NJ (yet somehow I can fly from here to Dallas in 2 hours...). Then it sits in NJ for another 12 hours before taking an 9 hour flight to Dallas...where it's still sitting since 5 am this morning.

I mean hell we do the St. Patrick's Day Parade and Celtic Festival and stuff. Hell I gotta work it which means he's there with me and Syd's all decked out anyway so why not? <br /><br />So I'm looking at this site and I'm having trouble deciding between the Ancient Irish Kilt Style and the more modern Kilt.

Plus it says that it's really good for growing kids b/c it can do more expanding b/c you pleat it yourself each time.</span></td></tr></tbody></table>"

This is driving me totally insane. Half the time the wi-fi will only work when I'm in the same room with the wi-fi modem...Now it's not the wi-fi b/c the computer gives me 3 out of 4 bars sitting here in the dining room and my mothers connection is just fine. It's just that ff and IE won't connect (I prefer FF but until they get this java issue resolved in the new version occasionally I have to use IE). For whatever reason after about 30 min. of me trying to figure out it finally decided to work...FOR NOW. We'll see."

Basically all I did was take 2 strawberry cakes...strawberry icing and some fresh strawberries. I iced the first cake...then put a layer of fresh strawberries on top. Then threw a second cake on top (to make a double layer) and iced that and sliced fresh strawberries and put it all over it...mmmmm damn was it good. There's barely any left. I don't know where I came up with it...and I'm sure it's been done before...it just popped in my head and sounded very yummy."

No fair using IMDB to find the answer.""<br /> <br /> <br /> 1.&nbsp;<strike> Do you find that this approach usually works? Or let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls - am I right? The truth is that you're a quiet sensitive type but, if I'm prepared to take a chance, I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal. Taxi! A little bit crazy, a little bit bad. But hey - don't us girls just love that?&nbsp;</strike> <b>Trainspotting...Samaurikitten</b><br /> <br /> 2. Dear Diary, I am writing in your bullshit pages because my shrink is crazier then I am. He thinks you're therapy. He figures if two babies can hammer me into a Psycho ward, what will I do with this ? He is so stupid. He's so stupid that he thinks he pulled me through the breakdown when it was Christy. Always. Only Chis. I was looking through his postcards. Paintings were his obsession. He used art as another way to love me, to help me. To keep us always together. <br /> <br /> 3. <strike>Oh, you think you're hot shit 'cause you get to sit over there and play Pictionary, well guess what? My five year old daughter could do that and let me tell you, she's not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed. So until you have your own kid, why don't you just go back to nightschool in Manteno and get a real job.</strike> <b>Juno-Half Deserted</b><br /> <br /> 4. <strike>And I said, I don't care if they lay me off either, because I told, I told Bill that if they move my desk one more time, then, then I'm, I'm quitting, I'm going to quit. And, and I told Don too, because they've moved my desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the window, and I could see the squirrels, and they were married, but then, they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much, and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler and it's not okay because if they take my stapler then I'll set the building on fire...</strike>&nbsp; <b>Office Space...Samaurikitten</b><br /> <br /> 5.<strike> I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going? How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die. </strike><b>Bladerunner-Elabeth</b><br /> <br /> 6. Don't be a good neighbor anymore to her. I'll have to send you a love letter! Straight from my heart, fucker! You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet from a fucking gun, fucker! You receive a love letter from me, and you're fucked forever! You understand, fuck? I'll send you straight to hell, fucker!... In dreams... I walk with you. In dreams... I talk to you. In dreams, you're mine... all the time. Forever. <br /><br /> 7. <strike>Todd! Are you not aware that I get farty and bloated with a foamy latte?</strike> <b>Zoolander-Halfdeserted</b><br /> <br /> 8.<strike> Now a question of etiquette; as I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch...? </strike><b>Fight Club-Elabeth</b><br /> <br /> 9. That weapon will replace your tongue. You will learn to speak through it. And your poetry will now be written with blood. <br /> <br /> 10. <strike>I don't believe that God made man in his image. 'Cause most of the shit that happens comes from man. No, I think man was made in the Devil's image. And women were created out of God. 'Cause after all, women can have babies, which is kind of like creating. And which also accounts for the fact that women are so attracted to men... 'cause let's face it... the Devil is a hell of a lot more interesting! Believe me, I've slept with some saints in my day, I know what I'm talking about. So the whole point in life is for men and women to get married... so that God and the Devil can get together and work it out. Not that we have to get married. God forbid</strike>.&nbsp; T<b>he Fisher King-Samaurikitten</b><br /> <br /> 11. <strike>It begins with the king as a boy, having to spend the night alone in the forest to prove his courage so he can become king. Now while he is spending the night alone he's visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire appears the holy grail, symbol of God's divine grace. And a voice said to the boy, ""You shall be keeper of the grail so that it may heal the hearts of men."" But the boy was blinded by greater visions of a life filled with power and glory and beauty. And in this state of radical amazement he felt for a brief moment not like a boy, but invincible, like God, so he reached into the fire to take the grail, and the grail vanished, leaving him with his hand in the fire to be terribly wounded. Now as this boy grew older, his wound grew deeper. Until one day, life for him lost its reason. He had no faith in any man, not even himself. He couldn't love or feel loved. He was sick with experience. He began to die. One day a fool wandered into the castle and found the king alone. And being a fool, he was simple minded, he didn't see a king. He only saw a man alone and in pain. And he asked the king, ""What ails you friend?"" The king replied, ""I'm thirsty. I need some water to cool my throat"". So the fool took a cup from be""side his bed, filled it with water and handed it to the king. As the king began to drink, he realized his wound was healed. He looked in his hands and there was the holy grail, that which he sought all of his life. And he turned to the fool and said with amazement, ""How can you find that which my brightest and bravest could not?"" And the fool replied, ""I don't know. I only knew that you were thirsty.</strike> <b>The Fisher King-Samaurikitten</b><br /> <br /> 12. I apologize for leaving without saying goodbye, but I seem to have outstayed my welcome in Colorado. The truly extraordinary is not permitted in science and industry. Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field, where people are happy to be mystified. You will find what you are looking for in this box. Alley has written you a thorough set of instructions. I add only one suggestion on using the machine: destroy it. Drop it to the bottom of the deepest ocean. Such a thing will bring you only misery. <br /> <br /> 13. Of course. The rabbit's not like us. It has no... keen look at something in the mirror, it has no history books, no photographs, no knowledge of sorrow or regret... I mean, I'm sorry, Miss Pommeroy, don't get me wrong; y'know, I like rabbits and all. They're cute and they're horny. And if you're cute and you're horny, then you're probably happy, in that you don't know who you are and why you're even alive. And you just wanna' have sex, as many times as possible, before you die... I mean, I just don't see the point in crying over a dead rabbit! Y'know, who... who never even feared death to begin with. <br /> <br /> 14. <strike>What is this, Night of the Living Brain-dead? Wake up and smell the cappucino, geek. I don't know you, I've never fucking seen you before, I don't know who the fuck this 'Sunshine' is!</strike> <b>The Doom Generation-Samaurikitten</b><br /> <br /> 15.<strike> A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead, really. They're just backing away from life. *Reach* out. Take a *chance*. Get *hurt* even. But play as well as you can. Go team, go! Give me an L. Give me an I. Give me a V. Give me an E. L-I-V-E. LIVE! Otherwise, you got nothing to talk about in the locker room.</strike> Harold and Maude-Elabeth<br /><br />A bonus quote...<br /><br />He says he's jealous of the moon, because you look at it. He's jealous of the sun, because it warms you. He says, ""I feel you, even when I'm not feeling you. I talk to you when I'm not talking to you. I love you, even when I'm not loving you.""... you know I love you, Gina."

I actually just need a very light perscription b/c&nbsp; what it is is that my eyes are working overtime and straining to read and all like that...so it's affecting me when I look at a distance.

"event","So in my humanities class I have to do this large capstone project. We have to pick an artist, artistic period, musician, archetect...ya know the drill and do a 'tour' of them. Something like ""Dante's Inferno as depicted in Art"" or ""DiVinci's tour of Italy""...you get the drill.

We had to pick one and have it ready by next week as far as what we want to do...or else we get dropped from the course. I was thinking of doing the Dante's Inferno thing but then thought about one of my absolute favorites artists of all time...Man Ray. I presented it to my professor and he was super excited and said no one has ever done Man Ray before.

So that's what I'm going to do. We can do either a presentation via powerpoint OR a webpage...I'll do the webpage. I can incorperate more that way since he worked in film and all that sort of thing.

Sooooo there we go...yay...problem solved."

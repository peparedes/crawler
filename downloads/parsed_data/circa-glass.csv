Now i could be like her and sit here and write a journal bout how awful things got but im not going to be like that. its low. its is ""scraping the bottom of the barrel."" Lemme just say the good times me and ash had are never going to be replaceable. As are the badtimes.   Yes i love her to death and that will not change no matter how many names im called. 

ash, u are a great girl. im a dumb guy for losing you but im atleast im smart enough to not sit on the net and fight with you about the things that have happened and call u all those fucked up names. 


Now we are both left with broken hearts. And trust me my heart still belongs to only one, no matter wut she has to say about me."

So im on A no shwag herb diet lol, im only smokin the good stuff. unfortunatly, i smoke too much so doing this will kinda help regulate my smokin. simply the herb costs more, better in quality which untimately will show me smokin less of it b/c i dont have to smoke as much.

So i got my friend ryan a job with me. Its going pretty well, makes work alittle easier when u know sumone outside of work too. Not too much has been going on, i tried to get aloan for a car but i was denied. so im just gonna fix this car and hope for the best at another time. this summer im most definatly am moving out. so the car might just have to wait... 

Me and ash celebrated 2 and a half years the other day. We didnt get to do much b/c i had to work. But she did come to lunch with me. So lately it hasnt been too bad it sucks we dont get to see each other and when we do get to see each other we are too tired to do anything. But i got today off and so does she but she might go with her mom to go shopping. part of me thinks that sucks but i kno its good if she goes b/c she needs that kinda time with her mom. Im def cool with it and everything.

So im going on vaction soon, i cant wait. i hate baltimore and well to get away for 6 days is like paradise plus. no work and im getting paid for it. just me and ash in a little place in a nice area.  ahh... cant wait.

But its ok b/c we are going thursday. so monday  i ended up having off work to try to figure out wuts wrong with my car. Im giving up on it though its not worth the cash.

I dunno wutelse is really new. I hate baltimore and essex. i feel sorry for those esk kids. they are actually proud to come from here. Its such an embarrassment. If i didnt have to spend so much money id be out of here.
I wanna move out soon, but the cash flow is dying down. between this car, and valentines day and everyday food and wutnot. My financial situation should be done after val day. 

Me and ash. well i guess we are doing ok. Not perfect but not bad. 

I heard sumthing the other day that kind of got to me

CUSTOMER: "" unless u make 1,500 a week then u make nothing"" 
CUSTOMER #2: ""i clear bout 2,000 a week""

Wut the hell am i doing wrong? These are the same guys who come into the pawnshop and try to get over on us on cash.

Me and ash went back to her house, pissed at me, she didnt talk to me all the way home. I told her she complains alot and she got mad. 
I dont kno wut im doing so wrong. i cant make that girl happy for anything. ive tried and tried and its just not working. I guess im just gonna have to try harder. Ill find how to sumhow.
i love ash with all of my heart and ill do wut it takes. 

Work has sucked. its boring and i feel like its such a major competition. Moreless people take advantage of u trying to lure in a new customer who will only come to u. People are really fuckin dumb. I wish sum of the people who come to my work go get a real job and make it happen.

i hung out with matt last week, we walked a mile and bullshitted. i feel bad, hes gonna be a dad and hes gettin married. I dont think hes doing all this b/c he loves the girl though.

well im off to work, 9-9 today. ash is comin up to get her $ from me maybe she will stay for lunch. i ono....hopefully.

I got black slashes on my blue tattoo to highlight it. it didnt exactly turn out how i wanted but its looks ok. i might just end up with a black outline and blue inside. The best part is he did all that for 40 bucks each.  so we gave him 60 each for a tip.

Afterwards we went to ihop. lol i spilled tea on ryan lol...foo dwas good. Then me and ash went to her house and watched tv till like 10 she has to be up early today. Shes going shopping.*

I miss the hell out of ash, and it sucks b/c i cant even see her. If i didnt have a cell phone then i dont think we would have had time to talk as much as we have been. Its fuckin crazy. 

Im saying sumthing to work today, its just nuts. 
id like to update every now and then but i usually have nothing to say. I dont feel like typing about the crackheads who come in my work all day long.  

Yesterday was my neice's bday, couldnt tell u how old she is. i didnt even have time to cal her and say happy bday. Its just nuts. 
So on the 21st me and ash are going to get sum tattoos. im gonna get the taurus symbol in the sun i have on my arm and get it touched up possibly, but i honestly wanna touch my forarm up its looking kinda sloppy right now. From nicks and cuts and shit from work.

So i had a chance to be lp at the parkville homedepot but b/c of my job now, i lost out on that opportunity. Im making this very apparent that this job may have costed me the depot job, but its not costing me ash. 
Ill quit on spot if this starts to interfere with me and ash, a job is not worth it.

I dont kno wut to say, i love ash with all my heart, but it seems that we dont get time to see each other. Im just lucky she is understanding and knows its not me makin this fucked up schedule. She understands that ill be gettin paid good money and she also knows i need the job to make the money i need to get the fuck out of this house. Im not much on religion but thank god im with her, otherwise i dont know wut id be doing.  ok well im off to work....

I think they are going to fire the new girl. man it seems like we just cant keep people at my work.i ono.. makes it harder on us b/c we got less people but the same amount of customers.

Me and ash:
Well things have been just ok. I never get to see her, i try but its just hard to do it. i wanna see her and spend time with her as much as i can. im starting to get the feeling she doesnt feel the same. i kno she loves me. i kno that much, but can she stand me? i ono...imean she's my life, im absolutly crazy about her, and i adore her so much.

Ash has been thinkin more and more about bridgewater, she keeps puttin herself down about it. Then she says stuff like noone supports me going, although im the only person whos been telling her she haves a chance. Kinda made me feel like crap. I mean honestly i believe money will not stop a determined person. Cost of college is crazy but its like that so u will keep in line. All about responsibility*.


Work has been decent lately, for once i dont feel like this job is so dead end. I kno i can save alot of cash up and get out of baltimore moreless essex/dundalk. 

My brother walt is going to florida to work with my other brother dave. hes going for a week. 


I kno that is ash does end up going, i will be sad. But although being sad, id be happy as all hell for her. Shes so smart, if she wants it enough she can go. i kno i will always love her. <3forever.

See, i love ash to death and well, shes thinkin of college in delaware and she says it will be too hard to stay together. i guess shes right but i cant see myself splitting with her.  its just hard. but im gonna try not to think of it b/c i really wanna enjoy the time me and ash have left.

"event","So me and ash were talking. i felt like crap and decided shes right.  I need to make a drastic change in my life. School. i havent been there in 3 years... maybe its time i fuckin go.

I just dont know wut id like to do.  i was looking at land surveying.. that would proly be kinda fun. get to travel and it might be actually kinda easy... but then again i was looking at oceanagraphy.. the study of the oceans and the ""phenomena"" i think thats how its spelled. That would be a badass job. B/c in a weird way i kind ahave an obesession with the oceans.(indian ocean in particular.)


So tomorrow im gonna go to ccbc and see wuts up, i wanna see if i can meet with sumone and try to make sense of a dream. I dunno maybe im making a big deal of nothing. but its worth a shot. 

Heh for once. yesterday i didnt smoke weed. Although i did work 12.5 hours. It kinda felt good not to smoke. Its almost like sobriety is the new high. 
Drugs took my life. i let it, rode the ride and enjoyed it so i thought. Can i say that it was prolly the biggest mistake of my life.


Thanks for making me realize it.




 I mean it will be hard between school, work, girlfriend, friends and well time to myself and selling. it will be tough ill admit. But if im half the man i want to be then i can do it. I may need sum support, but im sure sumone will find it in their heart to see with my eyes and realize its a good thing to be alive.



Thanks ash<3.



-------------------------------------
I just dont know. its kinda easy to see wut i want but its hard to get it. ill do wut it takes. Even if it means to sit home and do homework all day.. i just dont want to be like my parents. I cant. I won't. If u dont believe me then id advise u to buy a ticket along with everyone else who doesnt have faith in me, and watch. i will proove anyone wrong who thinks i cant do it.



Thanks again for the inspiration. <3"

Work Wasnt too bad. Alot of people being ass holes. Ya kno  i never seen it this way but when people wanna pawn or sell sumthing they want the highest price and when they go to buy sumthing they want the lowest price... Its true. 

I may be gettin a dodge dakota soon, its jet black... its pretty nice. HOpefully no automatic doors.

So i took ash to dinner last nite, it was ok. i couldnt eat much and she couldnt eat.  she didnt like her appetizer, and dinner. Mine was ok i got fries and this chicken cheese and shrimp thing. it was ok but im not orderin it again.

Sighs.

I just dont know. I hope things go ok with everything."

"event","well, last nite was ok. dee stole from another customer and my dad was ran off the job, and next week my dad will be ok bout it. I dont like living like that. Im glad ash was there when i found out. Shes the ONLY reason i stayed calm. 

So i havent really said much lately.  I finally paid me and ashs 4day vacation off a few weeks ago. That will be cool. im looking forward to that. I think its the being alone with her kinda thing im looking forward to.

I might have to bite the bullet and buy a car from a used car salesman. Luckily ive known him my whole life. I dont wanna do that car payments thing ya kno... but i do wanna choose wut kinda car i get so im gonna do that car payments thing. They are gonna try to clean my a part on my car to see how that goes. But i ono.

Something isnt feeling right. 

------------------------------------
I could write forever. 
-----------------
My shoulder hurts, i think i slept wrong or sumthing. 
-----------------
Can anyone ever see wuts wrong. Does anyone care if im sad or not. I feel low. Like Low of importance. Like i dont matter.

Id like to matter.

----------------
Things just arent the same like when we were young. no cares in the world. 

i hate me.

The most misunderstood of all the soul signs.
Sometimes you even have difficulty seeing yourself as who you are.
You are intense and desire perfection in every facet of your life.
You're best described as extremely idealistic, hardworking, and a survivor.

Great moments of insight and sensitivity come to you easily.
But if you aren't careful, you'll ignore these moments and repeat past mistakes.
For you, it is difficult to seperate the past from the present.
You will suceed once you overcome the disappoinments in life.

Souls you are most compatible with: <a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/travelersoul.html"">Traveler Soul</a> and <a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/prophetsoul.html"">Prophet Soul</a>

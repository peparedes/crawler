"event","After my 4+ years here at PSU, I've come to realize what this school and all it's hidden, read between the lines bullshit is all about. This is how the brochure SHOULD READ:
</br>
</br>
<u><b><div style=""text-align: center;"">Future Student Resource Center for Penn State University</div></b></u>
<div align=center><u><b>Majors include:</b></u></div>
</br>
<font color=""#ffff00""><u><b>Film</b></u></font>: Learning bullshit opinions and theories you will never use in the real world while being subjected to long haired hippy fucks who think they are smarter than they really are. Learn little to no trade skills and be subjected to the same material over and over only to graduate and realize you now learned nothing from PSU. Thank us for the internships.
</br>
</br>
<font color=""#ffff00""><u><b>Finance</b></u></font>: Studies include sleeping for 10-15 minutes at a time between the 6 hour periods of trying to figure out how to actually do the work in your major. Ultimately end up hating all mathematical operations.
</br>
</br>
<font color=""#ffff00""><u><b>Geoscience</b></u></font>: Spend hours going on field trips to even more depressing areas of PA than Altoona to dig through rocks and find nothing. Only to return to your classes which are located at the farthest most corner of campus from where you live and be extremely bored.
</br>
</br>
<font color=""#ffff00""><u><b>Pre-Med</b></u></font>: Just kill yourself now.
</br>
</br>
<font color=""#ffff00""><u><b>Biology</b></u></font>: Experience the wonder of vast lecture halls with hundreds of students who are as clueless as you are. Try and take notes as fast as they are presented, only to be left behind in the lecture, having to resort to printing hundreds of powerpoint slides out, only to have absolutely NONE OF IT be on the exams.
</br>
</br>
<font color=""#ffff00""><u><b>Criminal Justice</b></u></font>: Spend your days dealing with kids in juvy while trying to hide the fact that you smoked way too much pot during the course of your college career to ever qualify for a position on the police force.
</br>
</br>
<font color=""#ffff00""><u><b>Business</b></u></font>: Spend four years learning the ins and outs of business only to graduate and not be able to find a job within your field and ultimately end up working for one of our other majors.
</br>
</br>
<font color=""#ffff00""><u><b>Hotel and Restaurant Management</b></u></font>: Waste the days away here at PSU in your wine tasting classes, bartending seminars, and get dressed up for presentations that will ultimately take up all your time during the week.
</br>
</br>
<font color=""#ffff00""><u><b>Computer Science</b></u></font>: Have megabytes of fun trying to learn C++ and J++ with tons of other confused caucasion students while Asians in your classes help you cheat and ultimately get caught when you forget to change their name on your final project.
</br>
</br>
We can't wait to see you here in wonderful University Park for the upcoming year!"

"event","Also, I've figured out what to call all the film major douchebags I fucking hate. And for those of you who don't know...

 <u><b>Film Major Douchebags</b></u>
1. Hippies, usually ranging in the 24-28 year old range who should have graduated years ago.
2. Long haired leftover high school burnouts who watched too much of the Turner Classic Movie channel while getting stoned and now think they are movie carnosaurs.
3. These kids who go to basically every independent film festival in the state, only to try and kiss ass to the film theory teachers about it.
4. Pretentious fucks who try to act and talk like they are smarter than everyone else. They're just better at making up false bullshit theories about movies.
5. Kids named Grover.
6. Always have a story to tell in class to the teacher who really couldn't give a fuck.

I call them <b>""Indies""</b>. So when you see one of these freakin kids, you now have something to call them. I'm sure you have at least one in one of your classes... They're in EVERY FUCKING ONE OF MINE. These people need to be beaten with large canisters containing their own crappy student films. That's probably why I haven't made one. I can't stand to work with these kids, I can't stand to be around them, and I really wish I would somehow be put in an uncontrolled setting where one of them somehow gave me a reason to kick their ass. I know I have plenty who agree with me within my major and those surrounding. We have to remain strong and hope we can escape the bullshit of the <b>""Indie""</b> population. Happy hunting..."

"event","Granted for those who know me well, know how I can get and how I view things. Matt even said the other day that it's odd to see people who know how I really am up here. Project Pat can attest to that. Anyway, I came across something that basically can describe me in two sentences. Don't get me wrong, this shouldn't be taken as a bad thing, but for a lot of stuff, it can easily be applied. Especially if you know my personality.

 <b><i>I dont even have to know you to hate you. I'm fueled by sterotypes and my blind faith.</i></b>

In my recent agenda of ""doing nothing"" I've also somehow come across the perfect Saturday. What is the perfect Saturday you ask? Basically, this:
3PM - Wake up to a phone call hearing that your best friend puked everywhere.
4PM - Being dragged down the street to plow...
4:30 - Round 2...
5PM - 11:59PM - Drinking... food... burn... etc. etc. etc.

It's getting to the point where now I really want to start just killing the douchebag kids who are in my major. I seriously hate every fucking one. They are all the same. Fucking Indie film faggots who drink too much coffee and listen to too much jazz while trying to figure out what 15 letter words they can spring on their film theory teacher tomorrow. Just a bunch of kids who think and act smarter than they really are. Damn hippie tools... they all need to get their asses kicked.

Granted I have no idea what's going on in ANY of my classes, nor do I even know what I'm studying in some. Apparently there's some kind of research class that is in a computer lab... Not gonna get much work done in there... And the teacher barely speaks English. Gotta love Penn State. Ridiculous classes, foreign teachers, tons of bars, and hot girls everywhere. I missed school.

In terms of music I've discovered that despite the radio destroying their single on their newest album, Switchfoot is a really fucking good band. I've also gotten into New Found Glory more since I got my hands on Catalyst. Definitely make an effort to check them out.

I can't find out if we were really on or not from last week or when we're gonna be on this week, but if at all it's Thursday. Anyway, Conan's a shitload of fun. Cool interns, cool staff.

On a side note:

<u>New Personal Policies for the Summer</u>

1. Not wearing pants unless I have to. I've decided they hinder my movement and pants just suck. Forget shorts. Shorts are for the beach and shit. So, pants are non-existant unless otherwise required by law, society, etc.

2. Not going back to school unless I am my original high school weight of 155. Right now I've lost about 5 pounds from simply not living with Matt. Turns out that eating half a box of pasta at 4AM every other night makes you gain weight... who would've thought? Anyway, I'm down from 175 to 170 now. 15 to go.. maybe some more. Bulkin up the pecs as well.

3. Making it a point not to talk to people from high school I happen to run into at bars for more than 10 minutes. I just end up remembering why I hated them in the first place... and by then I'm stuck in some stupid story about what they're doing now and what they did the past 4 years in school.

4. Just to be a dick, I think I'm gonna try and oust a girl out from a guy. If I'm at a bar, and I see some tool lookin guy with a girl who is out of his league, I'm just gonna start hittin on her and shit, not leavin the girl alone. This will totally work, because 99% chance the guy will be a lanky soccer player lookin faggot who weighs little more than my leg.

5. I'm going to try and take up drinking a hard alcohol of choice. I haven't really picked my brand yet. I want something tolerable that I can have anytime I feel like pregaming, at the bars.... in the mornings... you know something like that...  : P    Suggestions welcome."

Goin to see Harry in IMAX on Saturday with some ridiculous sound system that will probably leave me deaf for a while. Something like 32 speakers or something. Anyway, can't wait for Harry... Day After Tomorrow was a disappointment unfortunately... once again bringing me back to my point of Hollywood going downhill just repackaging old scenarios, making them worse and worse.

If the movie is true to how the real even happened, then the Alamo has to be the dumbest and most uneventful piece of history in the world. It basically goes like this:

2000 Mexican fire a cannon. 132 Texans fire all of theirs back. Mexican retreat. Next day, repeat. Finally, Mexicans charge, everyone in the Alamo dies. Houston comes in, kills the Mexican army in 18 minutes. Some of the worst acting I've ever seen. Some of the dumbest dialogue I've ever heard... and I didn't hear much because I kept falling asleep it was so boring. I completely missed the first half hour. Anyway, avoid the Alamo at all costs... because you just might never forget it like I can't.

"event","Ok, I'm really disappointed but moreso annoyed and angry... And when I become annoyed and angry I listen to Rage, as you can see below. I just got back from seeing Hellboy. I really wanted to like this movie. I truly did. But I just couldn't. For several reasons... now you can chalk this up to me being some kind of anal film major or a self proclaimed carnosaur of films, but honestly, someone fucked up big time in the continuity of this movie. Not only was there too much tangent time within the movie, I think they were trying to fit too much of the story into the 132 minutes that the movie was. People want to see action and explosions when it comes to superheroes. Especially ones based off of comic books. Too much talking, not enough usual bad guy, good guy banter, and there were characters that just went nowhere.

Semi Spoiler
The new guy they bring in was said to be chosen for a specific reason to carry on Hellboy's work for his father, that's never addressed again, Abe is in the first half of the movie and then is never seen again. Selma Blair was looking hot as usual, but all you want to do is see her use her power and the little that they showed was not enough. As for Hellboy, cool looking character, cool premise, but bad writing and direction made the movie lacking.

The continuity was enough to annoy me. Hellboy is apparently immune to fire seeing as how he's a demon. There's a scene where the tips of his horns are lit up like hot coals from having the bottom of a train scraping against them at like 80 mph. So he goes to touch them and it singes his finger and he flinches. He's immune to fire, he's not supposed to hurt. Someone fucked up in the script writing department. Things were too easily resolved in the film and there was more screentime for the henchmen than the actual head bad guy himself. As for trying to create a subplot of mixed feelings love triangle between Hellboy, the new FBI agent brought in to accompany Hellboy, and Selma Blair's character, it was stupid and unnecessary. While the fighting scenes were fun, they felt like they were prematurely cut short or the bad guys were defeated too easily. I wouldn't mind that if they had made Hellboy seem like this indestructable demon, but he spends half the movie bleeding from stupid shit like glass or rocks. He's a goddamn demon who can withstand fire. You mean to tell me if I chuck a few shards of glass it's gonna slow him down? Stupid, stupid, stupid. Guillermo Del Torro did a good job with Blade and Blade II, I just hope he doesn't fuck any other cool movies up.

As more and more time goes by, I'm losing faith in Hollywood to make good movies. Every once in a while they make something unbelievable and do things right, but I'm seeing more and more cool ideas being ruined. I don't know what's better, knowing that Hollywood is turning to shit and that it makes me more confident each passing day that I could easily break into the movie business with just one of thousands of ideas I have speeding through my brain, or that when I do get into the business, it's going to be turned to shit and looked upon as a mockery that pumps out mindless, horribly made movies that can only rival reality tv shows in their absolute fucking shittiness.

Overall I give Hellboy 6.5. Should I ever meet the comic book creator, I'll have to congratulate him on helping to create a subpar movie about a really cool looking character he made that could have been a box office hit. I don't even read comics and I know Hellboy is a million times cooler than this movie made him. Once again, Hollywood... I send a nice big fuck you, you talentless pricks."

Time to look for those action figures... I watched the old 80s cartoon and the new ones from this year. The guys who thought this concept up were insane. But we ate it up as little kids. It makes me wonder why the cartoons on Cartoon Network are so freaking weird. Like look at Aqua Teen Hunger Force. What fucking guy had the audacity to walk into the Cartoon Network board room and pitch this show?

In case you don't know, Aqua Teen Hunger Force is about a Milkshake, an order of Fries with a gotee, and a Meatball who talks kinda like Bobby from Bobby's World. This show is ridiculous. I don't understand how people can honestly think this stuff is good and put it on TV.

2. People who chant E-A-G-L-E-S... especially when drunk.
3. Pennsylvanians who try to tell me that I don't know anything about the big city and that Pittsburg and Philadelphia are better than NYC.
4. Everyone with a PA license plate who drives UNDER the speed limit.
5. All kids named Chris.
6. People who think Dave Matthews Band is the best band ever.
7. People who massacre the lyrics to Bon Jovi songs at parties and then try tell me that they suck and that (insert random generic country singer here) is better.
8. Country singers who make songs about how the love their tractor and want to marry their horse.
9. Kids who say ""I'm Rick James, bitch!"" These people absolutely must die above all else...

"event","Woke up at 1 so I'd be ready to shoot for XY today, but our host is really sick so we said fuck it. Guess I have the rest of the day to sleep. On the down side... to whoever the fuck has the game I want from Blockbuster... I asked and it's 6 days overdue. You better bring it back you fuck, or I'm gonna hunt you down and slit your fucking throat you little 12 year old shitweasel... fucking people...

On the upside again, UT2004 is almost done. Huge game. First game that I've ever seen that comes on a DVD for PC. Anyway, I guess the day's working out to be about 50/50."

"event","Tonight was a good night. I ended up goin out after all and finally hung out with Lindsey and got to see Smash and J-Go after not seein them forever. Basically downed like 5 beers in about 20 minutes so I'm pretty buzzed. For some reason felt like taking a few shots of the Goose that's been sitting in the freezer forever, so I'm pretty drunk. I'm gonna be vague for a little bit because I can:

Blond hair and green eyes,
conjur up and hypnotize.

Don't ask me what it means because only I know, and even I'm not sure.

Taping XY tomorrow, we need contestants still so if anyone wants to be on TV, just IM me. I'm out. Gonna go play some VG drunk. Late. 6."

"event","Well, not that it's really important or anything, but one of my main sites I use to get all the cool shit for my computer just went down after 3 years... now who's gonna supply me with stuff? Guess it's just gonna be harder to get stuff from now on... anyway, think I'll bitch about people now.

If you know me at all, you know I pretty much can't stand people. Not just anyone at random. I'm not that cynical. I just hate people in masses and basically anyone who has a direct negative influence towards me. For example, me and Matt went Blockbuster today to get more PS2 games to copy through our gamepass. Of course, the one fucking game I want is out. Brand new game, they only have one fucking copy. And now, some goddamn 12 year old is out there scratching it up and probably has it out on his own gamepass meaning he can keep it for a month. Never met the kid, nor do I know if it's out on regular rental or gamepass... but I've pretty much made up my mind that I hate him... whoever he is... bastard...

Moving on... you might have noticed it's like 3:20AM about now. Yeah, I never sleep. Don't know why, but I don't need a lot to function.

Well, I guess that's it. St. Patty's Day tomorrow. Hopefully I'll be out getting bombed like everyone else. But chances are as soon as I see the bars and streets filled with douchebag muscleheads and whoreish sorostitutes, I'll get annoyed that everywhere is so damn crowded and find a way to get wasted without wasting money at the bars.

But basically, if you're a person, and I don't know you and you're out tomorrow taking up space at a bar, making it harder for me to be comfortable and find a seat so I can drink with my friends... well then just go home and fuck yourself."

"event","Well, it's happened. Somehow I've managed to have even more free time than before and now somehow have the ambition and time to do this kinda crap. If you know me, you know there's sure to be odd and crazy shit to be said as time goes on. Anyway, whoever's reading this, thanks for stalking me. I'm out."

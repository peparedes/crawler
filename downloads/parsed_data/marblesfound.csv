a few things:
peanut butter rice crispy treats sound lovely
so do carmel nut rice crispy treats. yum!

i think I'm doing lady bugs/ sunflowers for Laurel's 2nd birthday. I wish I had time to make her a party dress. We'll see if I can perk up and have more time yet.


For those of you that still read, if you didnt know:
1. I had another baby!
2. I moved a lot of my craft blogging to <a href=""http://www.enviee.com/blog/"">here</a>.


I had a ton more ideas. I will try to remember to jot ideas down here regularly, it may be very boring. I'm sorry.

oh, I should get a clip board for coloring with Laurel. It'd be nice to have an uber portable hard surface with a way to attach paper for coloring.. especially with being stuck to chairs and couches while nursing the new one."

"event","I love clear contact paper. I mostly use it for packaging these days, I print up a mailing label on the computer, affix doublestick tape to one side (or glue) and cover it with clear contact that exceeds it by about 1/4th inch all the way around. This creates a waterproof type attractive label that I use when mailing.

I've also used it to protect some of Laurel's board book covers. (I keep meaning to do them ALL but am just too lazy)

today though, I came up with a fun use for it. I havent tried it yet, but you can be certain I'll try it sometime! 
contact paper stencils for fabric!
now, its probably been done before, because I know my grandmother uses contact for stencils for say... wood or glass or any flat hard surface that she could remove it from without damaging the surface..  
So, as long as you could get it to stick sorta decently to fabric I dont see why it'd be any different than freezerpaper stencils, except with the clear contact it might be actually easier to position it. Of course, like freezerpaper stencils it wouldnt be easily reusable (you MIGHT be able to get 2-3 stencils out of it depending on how fuzzy your fabric is.. maybe?)

anyway, totally untested idea. I'll get some fabric medium and try it out soon. (as if I'll have time with all this quilting, sewing, cleaning, and shopping I need to do before the new baby comes)"

"event","My daughter loves to color.

Recently I have been letting her sit in her highchair and use MARKERS as opposed to crayons which are far more innocent by comparison.

Out came a lot of papers. lots of scribbles.. sure, age appropriate. ... but we found that we didnt feel emotionally attached to them. We didnt feel the need to preserve them for prosperity. .. but I DID feel a bit guilty throwing them away.

The solution?

douse them in water and allow them to dry.
<img src=""http://www.enviee.com/livejournal/marker_1.jpg"">

I think the resulting papers are really lovely. 

We WERE in full scale production of these lovely papers, it was a lovely way to keep her busy while I got other things done.

however, I got a little marker shy after this:

Anyway, I'm sure we'll get back into it soon. I've only made one little thing out of the papers so far, and by far its not fabulous, but I think it illustrates that there's a lot of interesting potential for this media.

"event","Earlier this year we found out our newly wed friends
<img src=""http://www.enviee.com/projects/Brian-and-Kirby.jpg"">
were expecting a baby!!!
Oh, so excited I was! 

After seeing some pictures of their nursery, I tucked the image away in my brain, and a week or so later I hit the fabric store.
I came out with these:
<img src=""http://www.enviee.com/projects/fabrics.jpg"">
no pattern in mind, only that I'd want to do something simple, as I was ALSO pregnant and .. well, have much less patience and motivation and energy to work on projects than I did before I was with child.. (and taking care of a toddler)

I absolutely LOVED the colors though, and even the clerk ringing me up at the fabric store commented on what GORGEOUS colors I'd picked out. I felt super, SUPER excited.. 
until I realized some things..
1. I had NO idea what sort of block to do, and was crippled by this...
2. There's other quilters in this family...  usually I give quilts and .. its sorta special cause there arent really other quilts.. (ie. I think the dad-to-be's mother is a quilter, and I know one of the mom-to-be's friends has made quilt in the past...)

I had a really really hard time starting on this quilt. In fact it was 6 days before the shower that I finally decided to just cut the fabric up into squares, lay them out randomly and piece together a simple, random quilt.

Random, is not my thing.

In fact, RANDOM is harder than.. pieced orderly blocks for me.

The only way for me to cope was a combination of grabbing two random blocks and sewing them together, and finally laying the whole thing out and making and elaborate chart so I could remember what went where.

<img src=""http://www.enviee.com/livejournal/kbquilt.jpg"">
almost done with the top!

<img src=""http://www.enviee.com/livejournal/kbquilt_1.jpg"">
all done and out of the wash!

<img src=""http://www.enviee.com/livejournal/kbquilt_2.jpg"">
I'm really addicted to fleece backing and tie-ing baby quilts. I've heard from some people that they dont last as long as machine quilted quilts, but I gotta tell you, I've washed the fleece backed tied quilt that I made for my daughter SOO MANY times, and its held up better than our bed quilt which is machine quilted and has been only washed a FRACTION of times comparatively. 

<img src=""http://www.enviee.com/livejournal/kbquilt_3.jpg"">
Overall I was pretty pleased. My biggest failure was not getting better pictures, but the quilt was completed and out of the wash just hours before the shower.

I love making these quick little baby blankets. They usually take less than 5 hours, fit well over those basket type carseats that lift out of the base, are nice and carefree, washable, and SO SOFT!!!"

If you're not familiar, it was used to make things like.. <a href=""http://www.hobbylobby.com/site3/pdfprojects/HL-143.pdf"">plastic keychains</a> lanyards and other ..random (pointless?) things.

It apparently is used in dreadlock falls sometimes these days, but I cant find a lot of other information about what i could DO with it now. I can apply heat (boiling water) while its twisted around something (like a bamboo skewer) which makes it nearly permanently curly, which is fun, but... I still cant think of any interesting creative ideas for this..

I sat down to make a dumb keychain.. for .. nostalgia reasons maybe, but was SO over it lie 5 minutes later. 
Why do I still have this stuff??

edit: ooh maybe i can print some things on cardstock.. double layer it, cut them out, punch holes, and try to get Laurel to use it as a one of those <a href=""http://image.orientaltrading.com/otcimg/59_5005.jpg""> lacing boards </a> its a long shot though, she's still pretty little."

"event","Yesterday was a fairly productive day.
First of all I took a pair of black and purple stripey tights, and sewed them into baby leggings with the help of the serger. I didnt snap a pic, but I promise to post one soon.

Later I dropped off some stars and hats at  <a href=""http://www.boombatoomba.com/about.htm"">Boomba Toomba</a> and picked up my first check! hooray!

Of course, as soon as I get money, I go spend twice as much as I made at the fabric store. BAD ME!!!

The other day I essentially started 4 quilts, We have a friend who is giving birth in the next few weeks and I would love to give her a quilt, I'm a little afraid it will be over the top though, I've only met her and her husband 4 or 5 times... But the husband is Joel's friend from grade school, so... yeah. I feel like it would be nice, but I dont want them to feel.. weird. ya know? The other options for the quilts is to try to sell them at <a href=""http://www.boombatoomba.com/about.htm"">Boomba Toomba</a> but since it is a consignment store, it would jack the price up on the quilt to the point where it might be cost prohibitive for someone to buy. 

Of course another option is to list some or all of them on my etsy store, as its currently empty. I've had pretty limited success on etsy though, and its really SUCH a pain to list things.. also, because its competitive there's a lot of sales undercutting and my products would probably even seem expensive in that venue because I really DO want to be paid for my time and materials. 
Taking a bit of a cut for Boomba Toomba is okay, because it sorta gets my stuff out into the local population, also, its great to support local businesses, and part of that is being able to provide great products at decently affordable prices. 

Anywho, I picked up a few fabrics for the quilt tops (I was able to start them with just my stash, and picked up just two bits of fabric for the tops where I needed a certain color hue) I also picked up fleece backs for them, even though they were on sale, I'm always a bit sad at how much fleece costs, and how much quilting really costs in general.
I also picked up some knits, black for a project I'd been envisioning for laurel, and some red to be the edging for some pajamas as well.

After I came home I worked on one quilt, completely finishing the top, due to a ... computing error its a bit smaller than I was planning, but instead of slapping on some more borders I might just fleece back it and have it closer to ""receiving blanket"" size. It'd be the perfect size for over one of those basinet style carseats and such. 
I'll photograph and post pictures of the quilt when its finished. (hopefully I'll finish today and post tomorrow eh?)

so, still feeling creative I pulled out some old socks I had.. red and black argyle socks that I'd bought at like.. Target some 4 years ago or more. They'd become holey and I'd cut the toe out to repurpose it as arm warmers for myself, but I stopped wearing awesome weird bits of clothes a while ago, so... I finished off the cut edge and made repurposed baby legs for Laurel!

<img src=""http://enviee.com/livejournal/argylelegs.jpg"">

So cute! a bit saggy, but I dont mind, I love to use her babylegs all scrunched up in leg warmer style anyway.

Still feeling the creative bug I moved on to the black knit! 20 minutes later I had one of the best, quickest results I've ever had with a project. Now.. I'm sure to you accomplished sewers out there its no big deal, but seriously I was so pleased with myself. (I still am!)

I will totally be making some more super cute speedy outfits soon, maybe for sale, I'm always looking to make a buck. Will try to think of some easy, washable, adorable embellishments to put on them as well.

Oh! and after that I went to bed and crochetted a quick hat. I meant to make it for the boutique and bought what I thought was an awesome chunky wool But silly me I looked at the label after I was nearly done and saw it was 80% acrylic, ah ha, wool-ease is only 20% wool, still lovely looking and lovely to work with.. but even with chunky wool it took an hour and a half to create a hat, so really, too much labor for such a small outtcome. Laurel can only wear hats that tie on now, because she yanks other ones off, so the ones I made for her for this year will not work, so.. I made the one last night with ties and will most likely just keep it for laurel. Pictures of that to come as well!."

"event","I've become obsessed with making pajamas for Laurel. It all started because she was really short on warm pajamas this year since she decided that she hates to sleep in the one piece footy pajamas.  So, I set to work trying to make one pair, pretty awful is how they came out.
Then my MIL let me borrow her serger (indefinitely!) and then I tried some more!
The shirts are still not perfected, but the pants are coming along much better. Learning to do an edging on them that looks good was the issue on these, which are more close to what I desire, however the edging fabric is heavier weight than the light thermal material so.. it causes a little bit of funk issue.
Also, my pattern for the shirt top is not quite right, it doesnt overlap enough in the shoulder area, is too wide in the shoulders, and doesnt curve enough at the front neck line.  I supppose this is the trouble you run  into when you decide you hate patterns and are going to just make your own stuff.

Well, halloween day I sat down and started pushing some little pinecones I picked up at my moms house into a styrafoam wreath. First I wired each one to stick it in, then realized I could just use their little stems. I ended up running out of pinecones and had to go visit mom and pick up some more.. I had spray colored the pinecones I'd already stuck in with some gold halloween hair color. (great in a pinch!!! and i didnt feel too bad doing it in my bathroom, cleanup with water!)  I decided not to spray the natural color ones, and like the color variation, I'm actually not huge on gold, but.. I'm totally pleased with the results. The eucalyptus leaves are also from my mothers yard, and also stuck into the styrafoam with no problem. I really, really like the eucalyptus and am very interested to see how it weathers.

"event","So many of the lovely craft bloggers out there make pumpkin plush around this time of year.
I found myself wanting to attempt my own pumpkin plush, but I was fearful of finding a way of doing it that would stand apart from others. I sorta threw this one together in a standard globe construction kind of way, similar to the way I make hats actually. I only used 4 pieces, had I really wanted to make a nice product I almost certainly would have done 6 or more pieces. The sewing of this seriously took less than 10 minutes, and cutting was super, super super fast as well, because I didnt make any templates or anything and very roughly cut it out.. truthfully when you sew with VERY plushy/fuzzy fabric its sometimes very very forgiving.
I stuffed it with scraps of fabric left over from cutting and some poly fill.. inserted the stem and hand sewed it up.
At the time the picture was taken I hadnt sewn the face on, but had cut it out and was happy with it.

I'd planned on not posting it until I had the face sewn on and had lovely new pictures of it, but oh well. I got lazy today and probably wont finish it today. (I will be working on my nephews halloween costume with any free time I have today)

"event","In January 2006 I found out I was  pregnant, and designed what I hoped would be a whole fleet of baby blankets. In reality it became one. Not unremarkable itself though, when I went to the fabric store the day after I found out I was pregnant I bought some purple starry fabric. I absentmindedly thought, ""I can use this in the baby's blanket"". Later it occurred to me that I didnt know I was having a girl then.. and in fact, everyone around me was SURE I was having a boy.

When we did find out it was a girl I hit the fabric store again, totally forgetting to bring a swatch of the original purple fabric. I wandered aimlessly, but came home with some fabric that I just couldnt leave.. purple dragon flies. I knew they wouldnt match but I just couldnt leave the fabric there, I HAD to bring it home.

At home I put the two together, and they matched so well they looked like they could have been professionally matched or something.
The third fabric in the quilt was not miraculous or interesting, instead it was a quick buy with only color in mind..

I put the thing together, fleece backed it in the pillow case type style.. did some stitching around the edge and then.. well.. damnit I was just too pregnant by that point to DO anything. (besides, what energy I did have I put into making a giant beast of a quilt as a favor to my MIL and working full time)
so now, a year and some months later, I have finally finished it (a quick tie job)

try as I might though, I could not get a picture of the quilt without my daughter also in the picture.

The bottoms were a little big, I made the whole thing without sizing it on her, and I thought her swim diaper might be a bit bulkier than it was. I had to cinch up the back of the bottoms when we put it on her..

"event","I've been wanting to keep a journal of inspiration and ideas. For example, techniques or adorable things that I find on the net, coupled with how I'd plan to use that technique or emulate that adorable thing with my own twist... 
couple of course with my own brilliant ideas and techniques.

of course, the problem is.. I'm paranoid someone will think that these things are indeed brilliant and beat me to the punch line. 
Part of this is because I have no time to craft so, I feel like I must horde my ideas. This is silly, seriously.
The other part though, is totally based in reality, because this sort of thing happens ALL the time. Beyond that, the very beginning of this post pretty much states that *I* see adorable things and want to recreate them in my own way, so why wouldnt anyone else.

There is, of course a whole bunch of things to think about as far as copy-write infringement and all that, but at this point I'm not selling items, and beyond that, I'd never purchase something to dissect it in order to reproduce it. Instead I mean, I see a cute octopus plushie and think, ""I want to make cute octopus plushies!!!"" or ""wow, thats really cleaver how they put the head together, I wonder if that same construction would work on a _____""


Anyway. I'm finding difficulty in remembering all these little tidbits of inspiration and technique, so I'll have to journal it in some way, shape, or form. Here, there, somewhere. Most likely on the internet. Maybe I'll just make private entries and then make them public after I've decided to do something with the idea (as far as my *own* brilliant ideas) and post links to inspiring adorable stuff publicly.. i mean its out there anyway.


I've been working on some portraiture recently. Namely one of my daughter, which I'm having issues finishing. Mostly time issues, but also, once I take a break on an illustration I have trouble returning to it. I work on momentum a lot which is an absolutely impossible thing to do when you only have 15 minute bursts of time to work on things, or when your daughter naps in your lap and you have to make slow, quiet movements...

here's a badly cropped capture of where the illustration was a few weeks ago. its progressed slightly since then, but unfortunately I think some of it was lost due to a ""not saving and baby bumping the power cord of the computer"" incident.

I miss creativity as a form of therapy. I miss creativity as a form of recreation.

These days my creative energy goes into processing baby food, keeping Laurel from rolling over when I'm changing a poopie diaper (seriously, its like trying to lasso a tornado and ride it to town) and maybe some short bursts of something that resembles my prior creative means.


I started this a few weeks ago as a project while she was napping (she naps in a baby bjorn On me, but its  very hard to DO anything while she's sleeping)
It never got finished, like oh so many other projects.

Partially because its difficult to find time to craft, and also because its difficult to find time to photograph, transfer photos, edit/resize/adjust photos, upload them, and post them, let alone have any time to write content to go along with them!!!

Finally though I think I have a few minutes to try to post a few pictures from this easters' egg dying. 

This year I decided to expand on the natural dying process that we used <a href=""http://marblesfound.livejournal.com/38968.html"">last year</a>
Several years ago, I'd read a <a href=""http://www.marthastewart.com/portal/site/mslo/menuitem.3a0656639de62ad593598e10d373a0a0/?vgnextoid=546576ecfd22f010VgnVCM1000003d370a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default""> Martha Stewart Article on dying eggs naturally</a> and had vowed to try out some of the dyes myself sometime. This was the year.

We had an easter egg dying party, but unfortunately not too much came out of it in the way of beautiful productivity, but it sure was fun!!! The next day finding that I had around 5 dozen eggs in my fridge.. most of them still uncolored.. I called my mum to come watch the baby and I set to work..
<img src=""http://www.enviee.com/livejournal/easter2007/easter1.jpg"">

<img src=""http://www.enviee.com/livejournal/easter2007/easter2.jpg"">

I wanted to use the natural dyes but also use the same process we did last year to make botanical impressions on the eggs. Alas a lot of the new dyes were not so good for leaving beautiful bold impressions. the winner for the impressions was still the onion skin dye, but I did enjoy the colors that came from the natural dyes. they all seemed wonderfully harmonious with each other, which I hadnt expected!

<img src=""http://www.enviee.com/livejournal/easter2007/easter4.jpg"">

<img src=""http://www.enviee.com/livejournal/easter2007/easter5.jpg"">

Shown here are a some of the dye ingredients.. we used Red cabbage (for blue dye if you can believe it!) tumeric (yellow) and onion skin (deep brown/red) Shown also are some nylons and twist ties, the other main stars of the show :)
We also used beet, but only had canned at our disposal, so were not able to get much in the way of nice coloring with it.

<img src=""http://www.enviee.com/livejournal/easter2007/easter7.jpg"">

<img src=""http://www.enviee.com/livejournal/easter2007/easter8.jpg"">

I found that once I was working by myself I was really able to hone my technique. I wished I'd done several practice eggs before the party so that I could have gotten into the swing of things again and been able to more aptly teach the procedure. I suppose there's next year though!"

It was my first time doing a frozen buttercreme transfer, and while it could have been better, I'm really pretty pleased. 
A FBC is done by placing an image underneath a sheet of wax paper and piping your design over it, freezing to firm the icing, flipping onto the cake and removing the wax paper.

<img src=""http://www.enviee.com/livejournal/12w3_1.jpg"">
this is an example of what the placemats will look vaguely like.  If you're wondering about the strange shape, its because she has a small round table, and this way the corners of rectangular placemats wont touch or overlap....

A lot of these arent quite as ""themey"" as I usually do, though there's lots of tree, hearts, and flora. I've also tried to make more ""traditional"" looking snowflakes, just because I never really had before..  and because they are simpler and easier to do very small versions of."

Life has been pretty normal by the standards of new parenting, except for an extra little bumpiness at first... a low blood sugar scare, hip dysplasia which involved wearing a corrective harness for 6 weeks, an infection needing antibiotics.... 
Things are stabilizing now, and I'm finally realizing how the holiday season is upon us.

Last night we erected a giant fake tree. I've never had a tree this big, so I simply do not have enough ornaments. A normal person might go BUY ornaments, but with errant hospital bills running around.. its not the best time to do that. I'm considering filling in spaces with perhaps tangerines decorated with cloves and tied with ribbons and candy  canes.. and maybe small construction paper gingerbread people decorated with a white out pen? 

any other simplistic ornament ideas for the broke and crafty? (but not with a lot of free time)"

this is such a beast, still not completed, as I was about to seam the last three blocks together, but the needle tragicly broke on the machine, spraying me with metal bits and leaving a mark on my face... I couldnt find any other needles (darnit, I KNOW I HAVE SOME) so we ran to jo-anns at 7pm. (we go to bed at 8pm, so that was a big deal)
we ended up buying 10 1/2 YARDS of backing fabric so I can fabricate the back peice, and 7 yards of warm and natural batting. (thank goodness it was 90 wide AND HALF OFF) my 40% coupon was a nice addition to the backing fabric.

I start a new job on Monday, I havent worked since late July, and its different work than I've ever done... in reality its probably more my style... I wasnt cut out for restruant work for a large chain... but a deskjob? closer. The job isn't doing anything that I'm interested in... except making an income.. I AM interested in that.

I am excited to buy things like... FABRIC!! canvas, paint, brushes, a BUTTON MAKER!!!!!!!! (this is a high priority for me!)
I am not excited about the possibility of gaining MORE weight, by sitting at a desk all day, but how will that differ from me sitting at my computer all day while unemployed? the difference is that I'll have LESS time to get up and go make snacks, so lets hope I eat MUCH less. hehee!


The other day I got out an old project, actually i got out my FIRST quilt project.
When I started quilting, I bought a ton of fabric, cut a million triangles and just sorta...went. pinwheels... oh joy.
well, about a quarter way through it, I started another quilt for a friends birthday, which I completed.... and six completed quilts since then... I thought I'd finish my first.

Now, taking out all my blocks... and incomplete blocks was ... SCARY, I didnt realize how bad they were... okay... okay.. yes.. they are BAD...
I thought about just taking the best ones and making something much smaller, but in the end I just decided to grimace and try not to look to carefully.
The top is about half assembled, and my mother graciously offered (begged really, complete with pouty faces) to take it off my hands.
Truth is, if I dont look at how bad it is, I think its pretty cute!

"event","Months ago, one of my best friends commissioned me to do a portrait of her grandfather. Intended as a christmas gift, I finished it in mid december, but due to conflicting schedules she wasnt able to get to me to pick it up... 
unfortunately he passed away before she was able to give it to her family. 
This weekend we printed it and framed it. After her family saw it, I was given full permission to use it as a portfolio piece.

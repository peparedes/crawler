"event","i must confess i have been pushing everything aside for a boy, i put aside school work, my family, and my livejournal, but most of all i put aside my happiness...i did that because i was still in love with this person.. after a month of his famous i swear i wont hurt you, and i really love you , and i have changed, i bought into it...and yesturday i found out that i was dumb, i need to start listening to people, plenty of people told me that he is always with another girl and that they were doing stuff behind my back.. jon told me that no guy is worth my tears and i believe that now. so today i left him a message on his machine telling him that he blew it and that i am never gonna give him another chance again, but it is sad that i dumped him becuase he still wins, he gets to be with the other girl and now not feel guilty, i guess it is for the best, i cant make him love me and i cant make him care,all i can do is hurt and that is what i am gonna do..so im back to being lonely,but this time it hurts worse far worse"

"event","It is interesting to think of life in terms of evolution. I've been processing <b>everything</b> this way.  Doing a cold and scientific analysis of my feelings tends to suck the romance out of life.  Regardless, it's fucking fascinating!

Every living organism is (essentially) made of the exact same materials!  It's brilliant! You have a common ancestor with the bacteria on your keyboard, your cat, and the virus that infects you.  Bio<i>diversity</i>?!  Take care of your goddamned planet, it sustains you.

RESPECT that goddamn banana you're eating! 

In terms of feelings/thoughts...The science section of the NYTimes a few weeks ago was devoted to romance and attraction.  (nytimes.com search: science April 10, 2007) It discussed the evolutionary nature of romantic love.  Sustained ""ohmygodi'msoinlovei'mgoingtodie"" are programmed to last about a year...then evolve to keep interest long enough to raise children... Pair bonding? See: hormone called vasopressin.

It adds such interesting layers to discussions about open relationships.

"event","Stuck at Laguardia for a few hours...
will review some shows for all y'all....

First: COMPANY!

As you all know: the cast doubles as the orchestra.
It is difficult to find a triple threat, let alone adding quadruple+ threat.
Few in the cast pull it off convincingly.

My first thought upon hearing of the revival of Company was disappointment.  Partly because I just want to be in the show, but mostly because Raul Esparza was going to be playing Bobby.

Raul Esparza's biggets claim to fame probably being his horrible singing in ""Tick, tick....Boom.""  I think he's terrible.  His first note in the show was especially atrocious, but I guess he realized that singing like he's trying to blow a cotton-ball out of his nose is not exactly the best way to achieve good pitch.  His vibrato is irritating, his tone not supremely pleasing and his singing is inconsistent.  The odd thing is, he didn't even have to play an instrument. 

Well.... He started ""Being Alive"" by being awkwardly-possessd as he approached the piano. Sat down, with trembling fingers and accompanied himself about as well as I could until the song really took off and he got up from the piano and had a spaz attack at the front of the stage.  Luckily, the beauty, power and resonance of ""Being Alive"" is hard to kill.  I am in love with that song. Given that I didn't want to stab him afterwards, I'll allow myself to say his performance was decent...but a far cry from Patti Lupone's splendid rendition.

As far as the other performances were concerned, there were a some good voices and there were mediocre voices and there was Amy Justman's Susan... who sings the ""Bless this bride"" segments of ""Not getting Married Today.""  Her voice was absolutely solid, she played piano well and acted convincingly.  She also had adorable red hair. She gets an ""A.""  

 The Acting was almost as disappointing as the singing.  With three exceptions: the afforemntioned Amy Justman's Susan, the character of Amy played by Heather Laws,and  Elizabeth Stanley's April.  Amy's ""Getting Married Today"" was spot on-- fantastically interpreted and impressively executed.  The only other character I did not doubt was April.  I never doubted a single character choice.  This typical, ""dumb-blonde stewardess"" would be tempting to ham-up.  Elizabeth Stanley made very wise acting choices and was convincing and genuine.  When she said, ""I'm very dumb"" I not only laughed, but I believed her.  It wasn't until dinner afterward that I came to the remarkably stupid realization that, ""wow...Elizabeth Stanley....probably isn't dumb.""

Having never seen Company, I was delighted by the book. Thirty + years after the original performance, it seemed fresh, funny and relevant.  This was helped along by the set design and costumes--updated with cubed, fresh, clean lines for the decor and armani suits, etc., for apparell.

The second-generation novelty of a doubled-up cast and orchestra did nothing to enhance the show.  Orchestra, Actors and Singers all suffered from trying to be all three.  Interpretation of the songs could often have been better and was stunted by lower caliber actors and singers with the baggage of instruments....

I could only guess what's next on John Doyle's horizon.... 
A production of A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum...where...where...the cast...OMG... DOUBLES AS THE ORCHESTRA....and...and...they could all only play ANCIENT GREEK INSTRUMENTS.....like...the lute??!?!?  Ultimately, the show felt cramped, not enhanced by Doyle's theater strategy.  He had one good idea and ran with it...twice. time for something new?

Despite all of the aforementioned pitfalls, I absolutely recommend the show.  The book, music and lyrics are still genius and the show really is a good time."

"event","there's a time for sorrow, a time for joy, a time for laughing and a time to be pensive. the time was yesterday and the idea...was <i>fucking BRILLIANT</i> (and slightly morbid)

Something in the book I am reading (A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius) made me feel disgruntled about the fact that I will not be planning my own funeral.  Maybe it was that the author delivered a lame-ass speech at his mother's funeral or that he didn't actually bury her.

Whatever it was, I thought how fun it would be to always have a video camera and at random moments throughout my ENTIRE life time, ask the people I was with what they would say at my funeral if I were to die tomorrow.  I almost asked Sarah (who I was on the boat with) but as I was about to realized how creepy and weird it would sound.

It makes so much sense, though. When you die, probably half of the people you went through life with, too, will be dead. The ones who knew me best or knew me when i was young or when i was in college (...i'm suddenly struck with how odd it is to be writing about myself in the past tense) probably won't be at my funeral. So i should tape them randomly and have them say things!

I could start planning my funeral now like some people plan their weddings and go out with a fucking bang!

Of course, the idea of making sure I will be remembered or that i'll have some impact quickly overwhelmed my mind and the idea rapidly expanded to the thought of me documenting my entire life and then at the end being able to have instructions so somebody can give a <i>fabulous</i> presentation of my life. 

...point is: I felt like i should be writing more. Livejournal is not the outlet of choice, but i've yet to buy a real journal."

State vocal jazz competition was yesterday.  
Get that alisha? A whole fucking year ago all that business with Matt happened.  Do you remember my little...writing reflection about the whole thing?  It was just like reading an old journal.  It was also very fun, because I was calling my whole reaction to the weekend ridiculous and foolish. That all went somewhere though, so at least I don't get to read it and be embarrased by it. Because it was <b>real</b>. it was legitimate.  Going back to that high school and the audtiorium was a little surreal.  

Memories of that weekend came rushing back to me. almost stunned me for a minute, especially walking into the auditorium and remembering things like where we were standing, remember looks that were given. what happened where. bizarre.

okay. but real news--something now.

Division II jazz choir was sooo poorly aujudicated. It's upsetting to watch what I would call a wrong verdict being passed when the whole competition is so subjective that there's very little way you can contest it.

I will say that the jazz choir from houlton was the best Houlton has ever had. It's disappointing when the group is actually legitimately good and they don't place...but when the Houlton groups are scrapping through rehearsals to only get okay at the end and they get second...BAHH. 

wow. i get halfway through whta I plan on writing and then get sick of talking about it.
I emailed Mr. Moore. thanked him for a great high school show choir/music experience. him and Mr. F....I told them that maybe if everybody was as 'committed to excellence' things at USM would be different. Maybe if what excellence was wasn't so subjective I'd have a better time and not even think twice about going into musical theater here at USM. if the program in musical theater was you know...more musical theater then just shit I don't need to know. things like learning how to dance are much more practical then things like...oh...being able to do orchestrations.

""Can you show us a time-step?""
""No, but I'm willing to do arrange all your music!!""

sick and tired of awful teachers, awful classes and awful college performance groups (e.g. vocal jazz at USM---worse then at least six high school groups I saw yesterday....fucking PATHETIC!!!) and an awful program.

I realized yesterday why I wanted to go into musical theater.  Nothing is as exciting.  No performances I've done here have been <i>exciting</i>, though.  I've either been nervous as shit or just thought what I was doing was lame. No. I take that back. I enjoyed/was excited about one song in By Rodgers. (clarification: speaking exclusively about songs in which I was involved.)

"event","You know sixlets, right?
the stupid pea sized chocolate candy that come in a plastic casing that's very straw like?  They're too present.  Too much of them in my life.

On the plane from Denver to Maine, I remember my brother asking how long it was going to be before we saw our Dad again. My mother told him it could be awhile and he started crying.  I was annoyed by this, but to calm him down (and to have us eating something as the plane took off) my Mother gave us sixlets.  I could have cared less about leaving my father, but my brother would not shut up and it made me feel like jamming the entire packet of sixlets (plastic wrapping and all) down his five year old throat.

Last night I had a conversation with my mother.
Not so much <i>a</i> conversation with my mother as much as <i>the</i> conversation.

When I woke up this morning there was a note, ""I hope you have a good day in spite of me. Love--Mom PS I do love you!!!!!!""

there was a half empty bag of sixlets hanging from the door and I have been eating them all day.

""I had [insert name of surgery here] and now I can't climax. You've got your willy hanging like this *(limp wristed hand gesture)*, and I can get it to here *(half way hand gesture)* but it's never here *(guess that hand gesture)* like it was when I was a boy!...anyway, so I can go for hours at a time which is great for Jessie.  Three times in the morning and three times at night. but she's good for me, got me out of that depression I was in after your grandmother died.""

I'm getting a lot accomplished here by myself. Paying bills, filling out the FAFSA, doing Taxes, writing papers.  Reading shitloads.

The familiarity of this dumpy old town almost makes it worth coming home for break and not earning any money. I also sat in on a Show Choir and then a Jazz Choir rehearsal and if the rest of the state is as awful as usual, they should win again. It's nice that they have a full, blended sound in four parts. I mean, a better blend then any college ensemble I've been a part of, where it's like a ""how much/loud/wide can my vibrato/voice be?-competition""

Jazz choir sounds especially good. better than vocal jazz large group at school, which is just sad and pathetic."

"event","I think I have finally shaken the guilt that comes from nine years of Holy Rolling hyper-christian group brainwashing. Four years <i>after</i> the end of the Nine Year church stint, but its better later then never at all.  I realized this a day after looking at my high school music teachers' myspace (yes. it is hilarious even before you look at it).  Under ""Who I'd like to Meet"" it said, ""My Savior (ready when you are j.c.)"" and I had no compunction about unabashedly laughing for a few minutes before spreading the joy (URL, rather) to those who would appreciate it.  A few days have passed and, in thinking about my past,  I realize I may not have even found it funny as shortly as two years ago and there still would have been that primal feeling of regret and shame for sharing it with others.  

A little vision of God (in cartoon!): he might be  hanging his head in shame thinking <i> Child, You knew me Not</i> and as I become more and more convinced, I think, <i> You <b>are</b> not!</i> 

He disappears!"

"event","Sincerest gratitude to Senator George Mitchell for giving me a small bundle of money. Thanks to my parents for not going to college thus making me eligible for this money.

thanks a fuckin' lot to Caitlin Kelty-Huber for <i>calling me</i> last night when I could have gone to see Edwin Drood instead of reading and watching American Idol ALONE!!

Ah Well. To St. Lawrence Arts tonight so I have license to say to Wil Kilroy, ""please never ever ever ever ever do The Mystery of Edwin Drood at USM.""  To be fair--I've never seen it, but 1)the title?!?! and 2) The audience picks the ending, so it is undoubtably LAME!"

"event","All lessons with Kathleen are good, but today was stellar.
i love not having rehearsals all week. 
After having the luxury of spenidng more then 20 minutes to eat and spending hours watching Sex and the City, Dee Dee commented that people who aren't music, theater, music theater majors have the luxury of leisure time way more often then we do.  
It sounds so delightful to do twice as much work for careers that are not half as lucrative and that are totally unstable--- hence the dilemma.
i propose a renovation of program.  If you cut out the shit we don't actually need, we'd have room to double major.

So much else i want to do with my life, too! 
Can my life be well rounded as an MT?"

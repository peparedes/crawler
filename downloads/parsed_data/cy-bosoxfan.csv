Well I went to a going away party at sarah's last night. It went good, except when Farmer pretty much talked shit in my face the whole night. Oh well, I got last two laughs of the night. Whats weird about it is even though I was one of the people who tried to help him out and take him to the hospital if I had to, Farmer and another person who I will not say their name, wanted to take a punch at me. What do I say to that, whatever, thats my fucking response.

Another sweet thing was I finally got to see my 4 month old cousin Kira. She's really adorable, and i might be able to post a picture of her this week. But yeah she's got thoose Cuddy/O'Brien blue eyes and a strong grip.

Other then that i guesss life's been getting a little better. It's just so weird, only a few weeks ago I had a bunch problems both physical and mental, and it felt like it had gotten so bad that it was to the point where I couldn;t go and hr. w/out thinking about killing myself. What really sucked about it was knowing deep down in your soul that you couldn't go through with killing u self.  But I sought out some help, and despite the fact that there are still quite a few bumps in the road, i know deep down it's one I can, and will, get through cause i'm already seeing hope for me, something I felt that I had not seen in a long time. Now I just gotta take it one step of a time, and pray for God to give me the strength to make it through the day with a smile on my face. wow, I never thought I'd even touch base w/any of this to any of you, but w/e it's all good now."

"event","Ok, here's the story of me haning out w/my cuz Mike while haning at the horse show in NorthHampton  from sat. afternoon to sunday afternoon in bullet point format cause it's probably the best way to explain it:

1. Met up w/him at my grandma's house
2.Went serching for the perfect material to make a perfect beer bong, cause there are two things at horse shows: Partying and a lot of hot women.
3. Saw my ex-aunt who I havent seen in almost 16 years, and mike's sister who i've only seen pictures of. 
4. Went to the my aunt's trailer at the horse show, where she laid down the rules: 1. No puking in my trailer 2. No passing out in my trailer. 3. No Sex in my trailer. 4. 2 beers each. Basically were like screw that for the last one. The other 3 weren;t hard to follow.
5. Walked around meeting people while giving htem beer, even though the sun was still there.
6., Watched some opf the horse show w/Mike, My ex-aunt, and mike's sister, then said goodbye to them.
7.Went driving in a golf cart w/mike and various people, while trying not to spill my bud lite.
8. Golf cart was confiscated cause the girl who was w/us wasn't even supposed to be in a golf cart(I think there after her for some reason) 
9. Kepting meeting new people and even a pretty hot girl, who I soon discovered, even though she didn't look it, was a week away from being 16, so i stayed away cause I have no intention of going to jail. Though I herd she fucked some 21 year old puerto rican, but still. 
10. still cruising in a golf cart, drinking tropical rum, mix w/vanilla coke.when my aunt saw us she said that was enough for me, even though I was never even buzzed through out the night.Went to a party in a trailer were there were a lot of hot girls, but for some of them, their looks were about as good as their bitch attitudes.
11. met a pretty cool mexican name !MIMO! and got bitched at by a girl named Liz, who claimed I kept going in and out of her trailer, but all I did was go out ot smoke a cig.
12. Mike brought me back to my aunt's trailer saying he need to talk to liz, and I looked tired. i could sleep so I went for a walk, hoping I could find a lighter, but found my aunt instead and decided to tride w/her on patrol for any all muscled, no brain drunk dick heads who crashed the horse show party, luckily we only found one.
13. My aunt gave us a report about having to take home som drunk mexican. !MIMO!
14. Stacey gave me a call, and I went off alone to talk to her, we ended up talking for over an hour, when i went back to see my aunt, who was going to bed, I could over hear the other security gaurds laughing at the time i spent talking to stacey, but w/e, I haven;t been this close to starting a relationship in sometime.
15. Said goodbye to stacey and fell asleep in my aunt trailer, on the couch, which killed my shoulder, at 4;30 a.m.
16. Woke up at 7:00 cause my cuz had to go back to Virginia, and bring me back to grandma and gramps house to my car, so we said goodbye to my aunt, and left.
17. Miek and I talked about what happened. Told him about the drunk mexican my aunt found. 
18. After giving mike a few cigs, we said our goodbye, and mike told me I was welcomed to come to the staind concert in a couple of weeks when he comes back up. Might have to take him up on that offer.
19. Took the hour long drive home, doing everything IO can to stay awake. when I reached ware i noticed i was hungry so went ot mcD's for breakfest.
20. Saw Jenn(Jon's gf.) and tried to convince me to get something to drink(No luck)
21. went straight to bed
22. woke up, and read the my cousin mary sent me. i basically told her in the letter I sent how my life's turned to shit pretty much. She told me how's she went through everything I'm going through, and that it will get better, and that she still loves me.

that's pretty much what happened. and no my life's still pretty bad right now, but I know it will get better, some how."

"event","Yeah i guess it's been a while since I posted a meaningful entry.

For all of u who haven't noticed, i've been in North Carolina in the outer banks taking a long weekend vacation. I met up w/my parents and family who are staying there for two weeks. I could've stayed for the full two weeks but I wanted to make money, and I don't have the paitence to take a 13 hr. car trip back w/my annoying siblings. So now it's just me my grandmother and my dog at the house. 

This year, I'm really starting to hate my fucking job. if i wasn't being paid what i am now and didn't have a colorful cast of co-workers, I would've jumped ship and quit. Thing are really dif. then they were last year. The friend, Shawn, who imade last year got canned because he relapsed back into the world of coke and booze. If he wasn't such a nice person he would've been thrown out into the streets. But since he ""Got a lot of people to like and feel sorry for him"" they put him in a six month detox program. I haven't seen or heard from him in almost a month. I can only hope that he finds salvation and saves himself, cause he's not only killing himself, but his mother(his father has alzheimer's so he's lucky), and the one's who care about him. Me on the other hand, I can't remember the last time i felt so betrayed, bu all i can do is hope and pray for. 

Another dif. is thati've noticed so many signs that protest the company my dad is in charge of. My dad is the executive director of a company known as smoc that helps w/housing the homeless, abused family members, and provides half-way houses. And a lot of people in wocester and framingham are against this, and are going at my dad and SMOC. I'm really sick of seeing these greedy paranoid motherfuckers posting sings that say ""Cap Social Service"", ""Stop SMOC"" ""Jim Cuddy Smoc you"", etc. And I'm also sick of that stupid web site, www.stepps.info, that has all of there facts wrong. There basically protesting against something they don't understand.
 
Other things i'm trying to struggle w/ is me and smoking. when i was on vaca I didn't smoke once. Today i smoked about 2 cause I had to desperatly try to stay awake. The good news is that I'm almost near the point of quiting this disgusting habbit for good, I can feel it. I guess i've also been noticing tha people having been getting pissed off at me, or have grown skeptical of me. For all of thoose who've I've offended I appologize I've just been having some problems that I'm been trying to fis. If that isnt enough, THEN ALL I ASK is for u to confront me, and say that you don't wish to see me or associate w/me again and your wish will be granted, w/out any questioning or arguement. I won't think any less of you, infact I would think better of you, But I seriously need to know from you if thats what you want so please don't hide from behind the curtain, come out and say it, I don;t care who u are, just say it.

Well I'm gunna go cool off. I'm soo glad I'm not going into work tommorow. peace."

"event","Verse 1
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against? I have, 
I've been protested and demonstrated against
P icket signs for my wicked rhymes. Look at the times. 
Sick is the mind of the motha fuckin' kid that's behind
all this commotion. Emotions run deep as ocean's explodin.' 
Tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin.'
Not takin 'nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin.' 
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin,' an' takin' names in the evening.
Leavem with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth. 
See, they can trigger me but they never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now. 
Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now. 

Chorus (2X)
I'm sorry, Mama. I never meant to hurt you. I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet. 

Verse 2
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it. 
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it,I'ma expose it. 
I'll take you back to 73 before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD. 
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months. 
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch, 
cuz he split. I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye. 
No, I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die. 
look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side. 
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try 
to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake. 
I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human. But I'm man enough to face them today.
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, 
but the smartest shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun.
Cuz id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot Kim an' him both. 
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show. 

Chorus (2X)

Verse 3
Now I would never dis my own mama just to get recognition. 
Take a second to listen for you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position. Just try to envision witnessin' 
your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen,
bitchin' that someone's always goin' throuh her purse and shits missin'. Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome.
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 't
il I grew up, now I blew up. It makes you sick to ya stomach,
doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma? 
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, yer gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely. An' Nathan's getting' up so quick, he's gonna know that your phoney.
And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful. 
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral.
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong. 
Bitch, do ya song. Keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom.
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get. 
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit.
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? 
Well, guess what, I am dead. Dead to you as can be.

That quote is from two things:
1. My away message that I frequently use top display when I'm away.
2. A quote from a famous(andd personal favorite) book called ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" written by Hunter Thompson.
 
U may be thinking to urself ""Why the hell is Cy telling me this?""
To answer that question it's because Mr. Thompson, a man who introduced us to the invention of Gonzo journalism, and made known his own personal drug use in his work, fatally shot himself yesterday, he was 67.

Rest in peace Dr.Thompson, you will dearly be missed. :-("

Remember all the times that we used to play 
You were lost and i would save you 
I don't think those feeling will ever fade 
You born a part of me 

Won't you cure my tragedy 
Won't you cure my tragedy 
Don't take her smile away from me 
She's broken and I'm far away 

Won't you cure my tragedy 
Won't you cure my tragedy 
Then i hope that you can hear me scream 
Won't you cure my tragedy

and the nights you covered before me 
Every little thing that i ever did 
You would stand by me 
Everytime you would cry it would take my wind 
My heart would break 
If i could be strong like you were for me 

You are my faith 

Won't you cure my tragedy 
Won't you cure my tragedy 
Don't take her smile away from me 
She's broken and I'm far away 
If you made the world a stage for me 
Then i hope that you could hear me scream 
Can you hear me scream 
Can you hear me scream 

Won't you cure my tragedy 
Won't you cure my tragedy 
Don't take her smile away from me 
She's broken and I'm far away 
If you made the world a stage for me 

I can't take this anymore 
I can't take this anymore 
Won't you take and give her pain to me 
Cause my whole life I've made mistakes"

"event","I think I need to work shit out.....
Lately I haven't been sleeping great, I've been getting pissed-off more easily, and more often. Add all that to the stress I've been having, and I feel like I'm losing my mind. 

Then of course there is a supposed friend, who I thought I was getting along with better, might just convert back to his shit treating ways over a stupid mix-up. If that goes down, I won't brush any of it off my shoulders anymore."

"event","This week really hasn't been that great for me lately. I don't what I'm doing wrong, or if I'm just in a funk or what.

Today, i found out at around noon that President Shrub(aka Bush) has been elected to a second term. GREAT!!!!, another four years of a man with  the combined IQ of a stone brick and a wet sock, leading our country. Not to mention the fact, that with him as our president there is an even higher % of a draft happening then it would've been w/Kerry. If there is a draft,a nd since I'm already 18, and I get drafted, I'm dodging to Canada, I'm not gonna risk my life fighting in a war i don't believe in.

I've also had a bunch of problems w/my friends and family yelling at me, when many of them had no right to. ZToday My mom over-reacted, and yelled at me for eating something that was originally reserved for one of my younger siblings who did even care that much about it. Then my sister(Who has been acting like the BIGGEST BITCH, for quite sometime) bitched at me for leaving our dog out in the fenced in area during the cold weather, when she was fine out there. Then she bitches at me after I asked her a simple question cause she though I was giving her a bad look, when i tried to say I wasn't, she ignores me, the fucking giddy bitch. And last week a couple of friends of mine had the nerve to yell at me, especially since it was at the wrong time, and most of it was untrue. Then in some cases u see that they might be saying shit behind ur back, even though I've been respectful to them.

IDK, I tend to let a lot of little things bother me, that shouldn't. I try not to let it happen, but I can't really help it. All i know is that i should really try to relax a little more, and not take certain things so seriously.

well, lets hope my week goes a little better, especially since i have SAT this sat. and I'm praying I do well,

Take care

"event","Tonight at 8:00, could be the start of not only the greatest moment in the history of the state of Massachusetts, but perhaps the best even to happen in the 21st century. They were 3 outs away from elimination to the New york Yankees, but came back to not only win game 4, but 5,6,and did what no other team in MLB history has done. They have won game 7 and they became the first MLB team to be down 0-3 in a best of 7 series to come back an win,. That was by far the biggest comeback/upset in sports history. Now up 3-0 in the World Series, The Boston Red Sox can do something that they haven't done since 1918: Win a world series. 

If the Sox win tonight this will be by far the greatest Sports event I have ever seen, and quite possibly the best moment of my life. This is something I have always dreamed of seeing, and it will give my grandparents something they thought that they might never see. And, it would also bring an end of misery and bad talking to the Boston Red Sox, and.....wasn't there some sorta a curse it might end too? lol


Well, in other news I went to MCLA on Sat. I have to say i was impressed, and actually ended up like it. After that, I got a ride from my cousin, and we got ready to got to a fancy restraunt to celebrate the marriage of my Uncle and his GF. The whole thing was fantastic, my uncle even cried when he made a speech, which was a surprise cause he's def. not that kind of person. I even got to see parts of the world series in the bar section of the restraunt. After the party, me and my 2 cousins, one being my age, decided to look for some action and we went to NOHO(North Hampton). When we found noone there we dicded to do a little joyriding, and childish things such as vadalism. I admit I'm not the kind of person who takes pride in doing these kinds of things, but I felt it was a night to remember and had a blast w/them. Then i ended up staying the night in Deerfield at my Grandparents house. Lata

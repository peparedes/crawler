Yeah, I'm sure ""Mayhem"" and ""Cannibal Corpse"" would be real fucking proud.

I care enough about what other people think to allow myself terrible physical torment so I won't have dots all over my face. I go through enough ruts caused by extreme social anxiety to kill two people.

So you can fucking call me over dramatic and you can fucking call me shallow

I realize now what you say is the fuel for every thing I do so just fucking keep me going

your opinion gives me purpose."

Time for a warm/hardcore winter.

Last night my parents had a party for Dad's promotion. Well apparantly we are noisy drunks and after almost every one (thank christ)filtered out the cops showed up. I didn't think it was a big deal because I was mostly talking for them and...this shit never happens to us. after a bit of an argument with one particular officer my dad interjects with his fists and punches this monsterous cop in the nose. He starts bleeding every where and my dad's hands get pinned behind his back and four cops are on top of him ""Restraining his eratic beavior"".

It felt horrible.

He's in jail until 5 pm tommorow and could go to jail for 6 months after his court date, which is Wednesday.

If he goes to jail I have no idea how he could keep his job. If he loses his job I'm going to have to start working again.

It sucks. I wish the world didn't depend on money."

Give them hell.

Here's the deal.

I always want what I can't have and I always feel like it's necessary to stress. I'm not healthy put I'm at a pinnical point where I could really care less.

God only knows all the trouble I've seen.

Get me out of Kansas.

Today my mom said ""I brought you into this world, I can take you out""
and I asked ""Is that a death threat?""
A start look of realization melted onto her face and she said ""Yeah, I think it is""
And I laughed and said ""I'd kill you first""

She didnt get it until I walked away.

I'm tired.

I can't see properly.

Kiss kiss,
Adie."

"event","Today sucked a lot.

But tommorow should be good.

I often wonder if he's looking up from some one else. I think about how much he had to endure to know when to say something and when to retreat. And I want to know if he loves me.

He doesn't.

But any way.

I'm going to my sister's tommorow then to Ihop then to Ashleys to get Tooth Crude the kitten"

I love Josh Dye.

See me and him went about about a whooole year ago and I hung out with him at Headway the other night, and we were sitting outside smoking instead of watching the bands play. I have to say, his friends are the coolest people I've ever met. Tommorow I'm going to my big siter's house to help with a garage sale, and maybe just ahng out.

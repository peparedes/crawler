"event","Hey Xaldy? Last night, I finished a bunch of paperwork and left it on your desk for you to go over. Funny thing, though. That light you had on your desk? It short-circuited and that really expensive paperweight you had caught on fire. I saved the papers, but I don't know what happened. Had to trash both of them.

Sorry, man. But hey, at least all my hard work didn't go to waste, right?"

Those cookies were pretty sweet, if I say so myself."

"event","When I moved into my house, it had these really tacky curtains. I hated 'em for so long, 'cause they were just that offensively ugly. But I didn't go and replace 'em, because they were perfectly fine curtains if you ignored the fact that they looked like ass.

They caught on fire last night. Heh. It was pretty funny.

Guess I gotta buy myself some new curtains."

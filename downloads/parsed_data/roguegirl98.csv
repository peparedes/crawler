""yeah, for ladies' parties"" *in a stage whisper*..at this point i was trying to pick my jaw up off the floor...he proceeded to tell me that the most he'd ever danced for was a party of 39 ""all these women staring at me, and i didn't have a stitch of clothes on""
let me clarify for those of you who are getting lavicious thoughts...NO one, and i mean NO ONE would want to see this guy naked..ever..no matter what kind of cash or chemical inducement was involved.
later i asked my boss if i just looked like i needed a good lap dance, and was that why he thought he needed to tell me about his ""job"""

clinic was pretty good today.  i only have two minimal assists left on a portable chest and i can comp on it..then i can do them by myself.
i did well on my physics test also.  have another one on thursday.  math is confusing, but i'll figure it out.  i have another test on monday and a take home test due tomorrow...blah.

clinic today was pretty cool.  it was busier, and i got to do two of my minimal assists on a portable chest xray.  i think they're easier, cause you don't have to get the people out of bed to do them.  that, and i get to drive the nifty portable machine :)
some lady with a titanium hip asked cute bald david from my class to talk dirty to her today.  they were waiting for the tech to process her films *which is really code for scan the film now, cause everything is digital* and he said he'd wait around and talk to her til the tech got back.  she proceeded to ask him to talk dirty to her..hee hee
hmm..what else? the ring 2 isn't as good as the first one.  not nearly as scary.  
ehh..guess that's it, i should get off the computer and go study for my radium physics test that i have on thursday..yay.  wish i'd taken physics in high school now.
later!"

"event","ok, so i was informed at rush a couple weekends ago that i need to update.  this is for you kim :)
everything is fine here after katrina.  power came back on a week after the storm, and i praised god, allah, goddesses, and whoever else was listening.  
i went back to class this past week, and started back to clinic.  let me tell you, singing river hospital has got to be the most boring place on earth.  i saw a total of 5 xrays in the 8 hours we were there last tuesday.  thursday was even worse.  i did get to do my very first chest series on a real person on thursday, though.  yay!
other than that, life is getting back to semi-normal.  
i just got back from blockbuster, and as soon as matt gets out of the shower we're going to watch the ring 2 and finding neverland.  
only about a month and a half til harry potter comes out!!!!
guess that's all people...later!"

"event","so, i haven't posted in a long while.  life is hectic.  that is putting it mildly.  i've decided that i'm not going to sleep for the next two years...but in the end, it'll be worth it.  and i LOVE RT school.
i cannot express how excited i am about school.  when i was at the w, yeah, i loved THE school, and the people, and campus life.  but i didn't love my classes or my major.  don't get me wrong, i enjoyed my art classes, but they weren't something i came home and talked about, or got excited over.
i had my birthday on sunday, the day before.  i have class all day on mondays, litterally, so we celebrated on sunday.  my mom got me a preordered copy of harry potter, so i don't really get that until july.  matt got me a cd player for my car.  i got it installed today on my lunch break.
anyways..i guess that's the extent of my news for now.  i miss my jenna and my melanie!"

"event","i'm here in the computer lab..waiting for my class to start.  i'm still waiting on word aobut the job at the police dept.  i called them yesterday, they are still running background checks.  in the meantime, i've applied for a job in the deli at the gas station beside matt's apartment complex.  that will get me some money while i wait/look for something better.  i talked to the lady this morning..when she found out that i was spending most of my time just next door, instead of at home 20 miles away, she sounded much more enthusiastic, and promised to call me.  
i finally took my midterm in a&p yesterday.  hopefully that will reduce my stress level.  i've been having stomach aches and i got a stress induced cold sore.  i know it's not good for me, but hell if i know how to relieve some of it.  i've thought about finding a gun range and shooting something.
a week from tomorrow i go for my orientation for the radiology interview.  i'm supposed to dress up..but then follow a radiologist around a hospital and observe...some of this stuff could be yucky too..the sheet said something about a surgical something or other.  and i'm supposed to do this in heels and makeup?
i need to get on the ball and do my research into this stuff...i dont' know if they contact the person that i follow around, but i want to at least have some idea of what i'm supposed to be observing."

i had to get my fingerprints taken for that job app i'm filling out...for those of you out there that have never been arrested, they don't use ink anymore!  i was so disappointed!  it really was neat, though...i guess if i had thought about it, it would have occured to me that they would scan my fingers into a computer."

i just sent off my fafsa application.  hopefully i can get some summer money.  i'm going to wait until they have my 2004/05 app processed before i apply for 2005/06.  i've never gotten a pell grant before..but i'm considered independent now..and i'm poor!

"event","so, it's monday!  it seems like forever ago it was friday, but in a good way :)  matt and i went and saw 'constantine' on friday night.  we got there late and so had we had to sit in the very first row.  the people look really funny on screen when you're that close.  it was still a good movie, though.  then we ended up going to the movies again last night.  matt's friend anthony and his wife invited us to go see 'boogeyman' in gulfport.  that was a freaky movie!..it's one of those scary movies where they don't show a lot of stuff, but it's really sudden and loud..an 'oh shit!' movie.  i was tense and on the edge of my seat through the whole thing.
after the movie we went by gloria's house *a friend of matt's, he might be moving into her house when he gets outta the military to save on rent*  it was decided that all of his huge furniture would fit in her house.  i had to laugh...she said she asked him the same thing i did when she first met him..are you sure you aren't gay?  all his furniture matches and coordinates with the couches and the rugs.  and he's particular about the way things are arranged and put away..he claims it's all the years he's been in the military.
anyways..that's about all my news for now...i've got an A&P test to study for."

if it weren't for the fact that i have a test in anatomy and physiology on monday, i'd skip class and we would go then, cause monday is president's day and matt's off work.
another blah...the mean colonel said matt's gotta quit his part time job cause of the training thing.  at least he admitted that he'd been working hard on it, though.  the colonel needs to suck some old moldy green donkey dicks.
anyways...i've got my fingers crossed about a visit to columbus!..i miss all my people up there!"

i talked to matt yesterday..the assignment was not a mistake..if he takes it he goes to japan for three years..and if he declines he gets outta the af in june...which would mean having a job by then that pays enough to get his bills outta the way. *as marie will tell you, rent in biloxi is not cheap*  he's been looking at civil service jobs on the net.  one in florida and one in nevada :(  this really sucks big green donkey dicks.  i definately don't want him moving to japan..but nevada is almost as bad.
well, gotta go..need to get my accounting homework done before i leave for gautier"

on top of feeling like shit somebody stepped in, i got some bad news yesterday.  apparently, the air force feels the need to have matt in japan five months before he's scheduled to get out.  he got an assignment yesterday that he has to respond to by the 21st.  the options are declining it and possibly staying in biloxi til nov, like was the plan.  declining it and getting out earlier *also not a good thing, he's gotta find a good job before he gets out*  accepting it and going to japan for five months..two of which will be spent on terminal leave cause he's got that many vacation days stored up...or...going to japan for three years.  that's what the assignment said..three years...i'm thinking/hoping that it was a big boo boo.  why send somebody to japan for what would essentially be three months?..it makes no sense.  grrrrrr..he's going to call somebody and inquire about the situation today."

anyways...so, i'm back in school again.  at the junior college here on the coast.  trying to get into radiology school.  they only accept 25 people, though..so if that doesn't work out, i'm gonna learn how to bill people's insurance..work in a medical office, basically.  i actually really enjoy all of my classes.  except word processing..the teacher is a bitch in that one, and i'm bored stiff.  i'm taking anatomy and physiology this semester too, in hopes for rad. school.  that class is very interesting, but extreamely difficult..i have my first lab quiz on monday, and i'm sooo prepared for it.  go on..ask me what path the blood takes through the heart..i dare ya..i know it all!
i really think i should have majored in nursing at the w, instead of my useful art degree.  oh well, i can't regret my years there.  
i have a new sweetie..we've been dating for almost two months now, and he's great :)  i haven't found anything majorly wrong with him yet.  marie has met him, and she gives her approval, so that means he's nice :)  he's also a hottie.
oh well, that's all for now...maybe i'll get some responses and be able to keep up with people better with this thing.

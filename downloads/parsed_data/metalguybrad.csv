I found playing with a single bass pedal can be really refreshing and alot of fun. It makes your feet work alot harder. My right foot has progressed a ton from when I first started playing. My obsession with all things drums just won't go away...and I love it.

I have to work 12 - 5 tomorrow so I can take off Friday afternoon for Halloween Horror Nights. It will be more than worth it though.  No worries. I like root beer.

Today's practice had more floor toms and lower frequences than should be EVER used but it was awesome as hell. Jimmy's fuse in his amp went to fuse heaven. It got all blackened and destroyed. Brennen is better than you at Mortal Kombat. I had a lot of fun.

In other news, Told my parents I don't think of my mom as an actual ""parent"". She's more like an obstacle. 

I probably have the biggest and well organized drum set in all of Spring hill yet Sherie said it looked kind of small today. I MUST ADD MORE! >:O

Work is...well work. Making money, can't complain. I don't have to mooch off my parents. Taking Friday off to go to Halloween Horror Nights with Sherie. That should be an insane amount of fun. 

I never talk to Brian anymore. No big fight..he just stopped talking to me. Weird. No biggie.

The absolute ignorance of this statement makes me sick. Not only has the 9/11 commission placed very little blame on the Bush white house, They have let it be known that CLINTON let these activities grow and grow under serious threats. 80 something days into office, we are attacked and it's Bush's fault? I think not. Clinton, the almighty dumb ass, allowed the Taliban multiple times to get away with horrible crimes. I mark today let's spit on Democrat's who blame Bush for 9/11 day.

Ask yourself the question? Who would Osama bin Laden want for president? A hypocritical moron who can't makeup his mind on the simplest issues or a strong leader who is ready to sacrifice for a greater good? Bush has been up Bin Laden's ass since 9-12-02. Kerry would sit with his thumb up his ass. John Kerry proposed to have a large faction of american troops under U.N. control...that alone makes me wish he fell dead on the spot. He says we have no backing in Iraq.... I'mm sorry we left out France and Germany, dildo. This isn't meant to start arguments or fights. I have very strong feelings toward this years election and I'm tired of this countries youth going to watch Fahrenheit 911 and taking it as fact. Grow up America."

if found guilty of this horrid crime, you should kill yourself or be self-submitted into the closest mental health facility and be shot on site.

this will be made LAW when i become president.

""veggie"" burgers, looking at skunks for a long period of time, sliding a chair arcoss the ground when you could simply pick it up or listening to salsa music also carry the same punishment.

that is all for now.

Holy Voltron rip-off, you're Megazord!


You own being huge. You are the hugest guy around, without a doubt. Even really huge people whimper at your hugeness. And you are made of really huge robot dinosaurs. Huge. You are so huge it takes five power rangers to control you. And you can mash anything. Even mounds of foam rubber the size of cities. Because you're huge. Sorted.

"event","i kinda gave up on this thing but hey why not add a little entry

ever have something to say but you cant say it? you just talk to yourself about it? well im tired of that

coming from me..this might not mean much to some people. but listen, the majority of local bands have been resorted to nothing but a bunch of guys hating other people and using thier band as a reason to annihilate other people. im done with it all. we all love music and need to realize being in bands is about that.... music. feeling something and letting it out with instruments. i dont know why it has resorted to all this. 

i want it back to when i could sit down play with people and not worry about screwing up anything because you know no one cares. its all about fun. ive talked to louis about this and me and him both agree that the best times in the world are when we sit there and dont try to be jesus, we play what we feel. i want it back to where after a song is over you say ""wow that was awesome"". 

at one time most of us were good friends.... me marc louis kyle john chris cj brian even barlow...now its all hell. im putting down my stupid reasons for not liking people. im tired of not having as much fun as we could. starting tonight im going to try to make our band actually work out...making good music we ALL like and would feel confident enough to play to other people. no more taking sides... we are all friends. if it continues this way no one will like anyone. cmon guys. lets all fuck around and have fun. most of us are only 17,,,im hoping to live a whole lot longer than that... so lets get over the egos...


now i dont want any one to take this as a smack to the face... i love my band with marc brian and louis. i LOVE IT but some things needs to be fixed. maybe this entry was a mistake? maybe its not. i miss it all so much


i just want to have fun again

tell me what ya think..."

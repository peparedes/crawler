I've been living at my grandparents for 2 weeks now.
not that bad, you know, free food, shelter, whatnot.
But no people. just my grandparents, my aunt, her kid ben
my cousin shane, his dad and his wife who live down the road a bit
and thats about it. And i dont see all of them everyday either.
I cant complain its more than enough. But not for me. I need new
people. or rather i need some more friends. 3 or 4 is just not enough
for me. It never has been. Only now that i dont look like a retard
right out of nerd school like i did in elementary i can make friends
pretty easily. only one problem here. There arent any people to meet.
none. I'm gonna get them to drop me off at the library one day just to
see if i can find someone my damn age. atleast half of the population here
is retired. and i'm not joking. but yea i miss you guys. hell its almost 3 am
what the hell am i doing awake at this hour. shit i need to meditate. the woods
are nice though. oh i love the forest. and this place is great if i had it to myself
and had a wife. but i'm 18 i cant sit still for too long. i'll go crazy or rather
i'll just shut off for a while and wait. I hate having to do it too. but its
the only way to keep myself going completely numb. I've been down that road.
1 too many times. and believe me once is enough. to be completely void of emotion.
no hope.
how many of you can fathom that? Alot of people act like they dont care about things
and do. but, really not giving a damn about anything, is just too inhumane. oh well.
when you can talk about it like this i guess i shouldnt have anything to worry about.
maybe i have everything to worry about lol who knows. hell a plane could crash in the
middle of nowhere right on my head any minute so i'm sure my luck is holding out.
this place does play on my fears though. I have a vivid fear of being eaten alive by wolves
and they released wolves out here not too long ago plus where in the middle of no where.
and someone could go out and not come back we may never find them. I can see plenty of forest to get lost in, miles. I guess i'm just typing to type now, well i think i've been doin it to do it
since i started lol already going crazy. Well atleast i have all the time to myself i could 
stand out here. I tend to think when i'm out here. In the city theres so much going on around you all the time you just never need to think you can just watch and take it all in. but out here you hear the wind move through the trees like a lifting your sheet off your bed so it puffs up, sounds just like that looks. You can hear the cars pull in before they get all the way to
the driveway. sitting funny hurting my back. blah blah blah i've typed too much yet i can 
still go on. ha. Mckevin WoW is addicting but you have a life :p or rather you can have a life, you get a job yet? zac you still doing bad jokes to people? you know half the shit you do isnt
funny, you should really check yourself before someone checks you. Robin, you have any boys chasing you yet? i'd say in a year or two you'll have to beat them off with a stick. Dani, hows the family? they still....italian? :p give them all my regards. ever thought of dying your hair? 
red maybe? hmm who else reads this....emer! i wrote you some stuff on yours already, Orla ! how are you doing? still irish? yea i thought so :p you can never live that kind of thing down lol
ha i can still be funny sleep deprived. Daniella, well i know whats up with you already, keep at it. Travis, hows it goin travis? does it suck? well life does suck, just find things to laugh at
and it'll never get you down. thats how i taught amy to get by. if it worked for her, it'll work for you. Life is a joke, you just have to see it to find it funny. I'm watching the goonies :D they rock. There are 2 cats here Pete and misty. Misty will rip you apart if you touch her anywhere but her head. and pete is a people cat that will let you pet him till he dies lol
he just jumped on me thats why i put it in. aww he just got kissed by that girl and it shows his feet wobbling lol. Am i leaving anyone out? hell its not like you could tell me. You know i had sent Ms. P an email and she sent me one back saying she'd be watching the graduation online, only i only got it after i was already here, so sad. She had sent her best wishes to everyone.
Alex! you can tell your parents that the guy they dont trust because he goes by his initials is out of town so you can go out lol. I'm tired its 3 20 now, and yes it took a while for me to type this i'm mostly out of it. I need a girl. gah. if any of you can find your way up here i'll marry you (female only) well maybe not marry. but i will treat you really really nice, because i need someone to treat nice. my family just isnt... i dont know, i've never understood my inability to be nicer to my family but i guess it was a bad upbringing or something lol who knows. I applaud those who've read this all the way through its alot. lol just looking at it its alot. I'm keen to writing and speaking. I may seem quite, but thats exactly what it is. eyelids are heavy. 3 25. its gonna rain alot up here. all year. I'm gonna learn guitar from a friends who's like 40 something, friend of my dad and my uncle and he's awesome! and he knows all the stuff i wanna learn :) badass. plus i'll get to play bass for em too. soon as i get my stuff. well, when my bokken get here i'll be able to practice my sword stuff and keep my self occupied a bit longer. without my mind wandering. I feel as if i just walk through the woods far enough i'll find _someone_. damn bugs. Forest = bugs. there are 6 spiders for every square foot. and thats all over the globe not just forested areas. who has bad sleeping habits besides me? I guess i'll find out, and we'll ALL know if you reply right after this goes up lol.
Can you see how bored i am? can you? do you really see it all inbetween the lines.
look i'll make it easy
|bored|
lol there see.
robin sent me an email and put a sentance before her name at the end, a cool one, so i made up one too :)

"event","I thought i'd write another journey to the depths of your soul post. ok here we go.

Stop, for a minute, whatever your doing. and take a look at yourself. Take a look at what you've done the 10-14 years you've been a conscience being.  Are you proud? Are you content? the impatient of you would say you've been waiting. the patient would say you've been doing. and the ones who really dont care lost it long ago. Ask yourself if you've been making the choices YOU think are right, or the choices other people think are right? Who wins in the end? conform and live succesfully? or live your own life and live it to its fullest? i'd say a bit of both has suited me well so far. I dont think anyone one person could go 100% either way, but then again they do keep people in prison for life.  What if your dead tomorrow? Can you even comprehend that thought? the hundreds of people who would be affected by your death. immediate family, grandparents, cousins, friends, in fact almost everyone at school would know if you died tomorrow. If you knew, could you live with it? would you try to change it, would you grasp on to what little time you had left, or would you like me: go about the rest of your life like normal?  enough about me, more about you. Look at all that you wear, how many people really have complete control over what they wear? I dont, i wear whats given to me. I eat what people offer wether or not it tastes good. do you know the difference between needs and wants? everyone has a different version, especially the OCD people out there, no offense. Can you look at another religion and realize why so many people believe in it, without your faith wavering? Could you muster the strength to someone how much you really cared all along knowing you couldnt do anything about it, ever? And then going through with not doing anything about it? How much of what you say do you do? How trustworthy are you? Reliable, dependible, responsible, and honest? how many people have to ask you ""truthfully, what do you think."" or ""Honestly, give me your opinion."" I never get that. and the only person who would do it out of habit to me I let know how insulting it was. and she stopped. Wisdom is not a gift, you just have to pay attention to life to get it. look around you, see your mouse? wisdom tells you that if you yank on it hard enough the connection will pop out, right? All the words here come to me in the same fasion, and if you disagree, find something insulting, find something brilliant, find anything here, let me know i've made a difference to you.

I'll have a goodbye up here before i leave. personalized of course, it'll be a long post but i'll do it."

Being born on the 12th day of the month (3 energy) is likely to add a good bit of vitality to your life. 

The energy of 3 allows you bounce back rapidly from setbacks, physical or mental. 

There is a restlessness in your nature, but you seem to be able to portray an easygoing, sometimes ""couldn't care less"" attitude.



You have a natural ability to express yourself in public, and you always make a very good impression. 

Good with words, you excel in writing, speaking, and possibly singing. 

You are energetic and always a good conversationalist. 



You have a keen imagination, but you tend to scatter your energies and become involved with too may superficial matters. 

Your mind is practical and rational despite this tendency to jump about. 

You are affectionate and loving - but very sensitive. 

You are subject to rapid ups and downs.</td>

Nov 30'th at about 3:40pm An Explorer (SUV) ran a redlight at Main and Pecan.
A motorcycle hit the explorer. The driver of the explorer suffered no injuries.
The guy on the motorcycle was seen standing and talking, and then taken away in an ambulance.
His motorcycle (2004 Kawasaki Ninja, Midnight Blue) was totalled and halfway under the Explorer.
3 hours later he was released from the Hospital, with 3 stitches in his right knee and no serious injuries.
The next morning he jogged to school.

Yea thats me. yes i'm fine. No my bike isnt, its dead. Yes insurance is taking care of me and my bike.
hopefully i'll get a bigger one.

I remember slamming on my brakes, seeing pieces of my motorcycle, a guy directing traffic, a big dent in someone's door, and some paramedics. Then it jumped from 3:40 to 6:30 when i told one of the para medics still there with me that i was coherent, he replied, ""yea you said that about five times now"" i didnt have anything to say to that.

On another note. 
Auditions went pretty well today and yesterday. even though i missed tuesday. and i told the guys in the ambulance, today is just not my day, i have auditions right now i need to be at.
We did alot of Improv stuff and it was fun. only i killed someone, when they were suppose to be killing me.  oh well.

Well cant see crystal outside of 5 min at lunch, so it must suffice for now. cant wait for a new bike, if i get enough money, i'm soo gonna get a harley !!

Anyways. life is good, besdies crash and not being able to see crystal as a result thereof."

But words could not express
the way he controlled himself
not allowing the pain in.
not allowing his broken heart to pour through
his face.

His unwavering stare made her cry,
as she now  saught for one shred of proof that he really cared.
It was her decision to end it,
she wanted to know he still cared.
she wanted to still care for him.

But she had gone too far this time.

she had faught over the last thing with him.
Always turning something into something else.

He was done fighting. He would not continue.

he looked perfectly content just standing there.
as she could not believe now that he ever cared for her at all.

He would give her no ground. It was not his place.

Furious she now concluded that he never really cared.

He turned his face back to her after her hand left it.
He kept his chin up. not letting her even get some ground through the slap.

She knew the only reason she hit him, is because he let her.

he could see this pissed her off more.
he didnt care. He wouldnt let himself care. no pain.

she could not pierce his heart, even if she rammed a sword through his chest, she knew now, nothing would touch it.

He could see her dispair. And did nothing about it.
her choice. her loss.

""I'm sorry""

""So am I""

She didnt look back. But she knew even if she did, it was too late.

He watched her leave for the last time, and only then did the tear fall.

This has some truth in it, the situation does not, not for me anyway.
but that is how i'd picture myself breaking up with someone now.
Now that i can turn off my emotions. Its a deadly thing.
It can kill a love as quickly as it can a man.
But i refuse to hurt anymore.
I choose nothing over pain.

"event","I spent a whole day with crystal
we went for coffee at 8 am and in like 2 minutes it was 10 am.
then we went to barns n nobles, and then it was 11:30 it less than 2 minutes
THEN we went to her house and in no time it was 2:40 then we went outside and layed in the grass
and then we layed on her roof. and we just had a great time all day.
its wierd i dont know, we connected on a level i've never opened to anyone, the nature one. 

it was supposed to be just mine and the forest's, but no crystal had to have some too :P
we grew closer.
i hope it turns out well."

"event","ok had my audition today.
kissed dani.
ms p said it was ""cool""
so who knows what she's gonna do with me for the play.
Because basically it was how much risk i was willing to take, and it doesnt go any farther than that.
well, i'm not sure painted on clothing would be acceptable though :P


So i'll do whatever she wants me to, i told her Bring it, when she asked if she could beat on me n stuff for the show.

hows life for everyone else?
tomorrow morning at 8 i'm gonna go give Crystal a ride on my motorcycle, i like her she's cool.

And just because Dani made me take an altoid before our scene, AND she was the one who spent time with her boyfriend earlier...i hope she gets casted."

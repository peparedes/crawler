It&#8217;s ridiculously fun!</p>

<p>As an example, let&#8217;s look at the number of times people search for the words <b>hot</b> and <b>cold</b>.  I downloaded the <a href='http://kisonecat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/google-global-warming.csv' title='Google Global Warming Data'>CSV file</a> offered by Google trends to make the following graph:</p>

<p><img src='http://kisonecat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/google-global-warming.png' alt='Google Global Warming Graph' /></p>

<p>The thick red and blue lines are the linear regressions on the number of searches for <b>hot</b> and <b>cold</b>, respectively.  Behold!&mdash;people are searching <i>more often</i> for <b>hot</b> lately, and <i>less often</i> as of late for <b>cold</b>!  The search volume does seem to be related to the temperature: you might notice that the search volume for <b>cold</b> dips under the regression line during the summer, but exceeds it during the winter.</p>

<p>And so, <b>global warming is being revealed in our search habits.</b>  Maybe I should&#8217;ve titled this post &#8220;Google warming.&#8221;</p>"

You can comment here or <a href=""http://kisonecat.com/2008/07/21/solutions-to-lights-out/#comments"">there</a>.</b></p><p>I&#8217;ll briefly introduce the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)"">Lights Out puzzle</a>: the game is played on an <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em> grid of buttons which, when pressed, toggle between a lit and unlit state.  The twist is that toggling a light <em>also</em> toggles the state of its neighbors (above, below, right, left&mdash;although, on the boundary, lights have fewer neighbors).  All the buttons are lit when the game begins, and the goal is to turn all the lights off.</p>

<p>There are two key observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>toggling a light twice amounts to doing nothing,</li>
<li>toggling light <img src=""/latexrender/pictures/7fc56270e7a70fa81a5935b72eacbe29.gif"" title=""A"" alt=""A"" align=""absmiddle""> and then light <img src=""/latexrender/pictures/9d5ed678fe57bcca610140957afab571.gif"" title=""B"" alt=""B"" align=""absmiddle""> has the same effect as toggling <img src=""/latexrender/pictures/9d5ed678fe57bcca610140957afab571.gif"" title=""B"" alt=""B"" align=""absmiddle""> and then toggling <img src=""/latexrender/pictures/7fc56270e7a70fa81a5935b72eacbe29.gif"" title=""A"" alt=""A"" align=""absmiddle"">.
</ul>

<p>As a result, <b>the order in which we press the buttons is irrelevant.</b>  So to solve the <em>n</em>-by-<em>n</em> puzzle, we just need to know whether a button needs to be pressed.  My old website had some pictures I made showing solutions for boards of various sizes&mdash;pictures where a white pixel meant &#8220;press&#8221; and a black pixel meant &#8220;don&#8217;t press.&#8221;  I assembled these pictures into a video, showing solutions to the Lights Out puzzle for <img src=""/latexrender/pictures/eb73d5870f9adcb4d8657cd4a8f93672.gif"" title=""n \leq 200"" alt=""n \leq 200"" align=""absmiddle"">:</p>

<p>For as cool as that looks, there&#8217;s not much to be discovered (as far as I can tell) from watching these frames flash by.  But it does look like about half the buttons have to be pressed to solve the puzzle: why is that?</p>

<p>The still frames of the movie are available <a href=""http://kisonecat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/solutions.zip"" title=""Solutions to the Lights Out game"">here as PNGs in a zipped archive</a>.  Here is a solution to the 400-by-400 board:</p>

<p><a href=""http://kisonecat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/lights-out-400-doublesize.png"" title=""Solution to 400x400 Lights Out""><img src=""http://kisonecat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/lights-out-400.png"" alt=""Solution to 400x400 Lights Out"" /></a></p>

<p>Finding that solution involved row-reducing a <img src=""/latexrender/pictures/fc6fae00ddd26d2808c3eb25977e380e.gif"" title=""(400 \cdot 400 + 1)"" alt=""(400 \cdot 400 + 1)"" align=""absmiddle"">-by-<img src=""/latexrender/pictures/b1f6db46cdb499495fdddb0230e91754.gif"" title=""400 \cdot 400"" alt=""400 \cdot 400"" align=""absmiddle""> matrix&mdash;that&#8217;s a matrix with over 25 billion entries.  On the other hand, each entry is one bit, so that matrix fits (not coincidentally) in 3 gigabytes of memory.  One could surely do better, considering how sparse the matrix is: perhaps we could have a little contest for solving very large Lights Out games.</p>

<p>Besides the fact that all these pictures look awesome, Lights Out is a neat example to motivate some linear algebra over a finite field.  It illustrates how satisfying an &#8220;easy&#8221; local condition (each light must be turned off) might require a globally complicated solution&mdash;a lesson for mathematics and for life!</p>"

<p>I&#8217;ll be a bit more explicit: a dot is drawn at a random location; if it does not overlap any previous dots, it gets a new color.  Otherwise, the dot takes the color of the component it touches.  Sometimes a new dot connects many components, and in this case, the new component takes on the color of the largest among the old components.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of neat questions to be asked about such a process: for instance, after drawing <em>n</em> dots, how many components should we expect to see?  As you can see in the movie, when you draw only a few dots, most of those dots are isolated and have their own color; but after drawing a ridiculously large number of dots, they are all connected and the same color.  And inbetween, something more interesting happens.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example of &#8220;something more interesting&#8221; taken from a <a href=""http://kisonecat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/chart-25000.png"" title=""25000 random dots"">much larger picture</a> than the above movie:</p>

<ul>
<li><font color=""#009900"">green</font> arrow if <i>A</i> becoming more likely causes <i>B</i> to become more likely, and with a</li>
<li><font color=""#990000"">red</font> arrow if <i>A</i> becoming more likely causes <i>B</i> to become less likely.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shorter arrows suggest <b>stronger</b> relationships (technically, a lower <i>p</i>-value).</p>

<p>Running the algorithm on the market data since January 1, 2008 with a lag of two days produces the following graph:</p>

<p><img src='http://kisonecat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/final3.png' alt='Two day lag since January 1, 2008' /></p>

<p>And so, we see that the market data is encoding some</p>

<ul>
<li><b>tautologies</b> (McCain&#8217;s nomination makes him more likely to be president, and McCain&#8217;s being president makes it more likely that a Republican is president) but also some</li>
<li><b>conventional wisdom</b> (a recession makes Clinton more likely to be nominated, but Obama less likely to be nominated; perhaps the perception that Obama would fare better in the general election explains the red arrows from &#8220;Democrat President&#8221; to Clinton, and the green arrows from &#8220;Democrat President&#8221; to Obama).</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s amazing to me (and hopefully also to you) that the <b>relationships between the prices of these Intrade contracts</b> manages to encode popular sentiments.</p>"

You can comment here or <a href=""http://kisonecat.com/2008/01/27/clustering-texts-with-an-obvious-grouping/#comments"">there</a>.</b></p><p>It was pointed out to me by <a href=""http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~easwaran/"">Kenny Easwaran</a> that I ought to try <a href=""http://kisonecat.com/2008/01/22/clustering-shakespeare/"">clustering</a> texts that already have a natural grouping.</p>

<p>So I ran the clustering program on 15 texts written by three authors, and here is the result:</p>

<p><img src='http://kisonecat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/clustered.png' alt='Clustering Jane Austen, Shakespeare, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.' /></p>

<p>The largest eigenvalue is 25 times bigger than the next largest eigenvalue, and picks out the author pretty well.  The top pile consists of Jane Austen&#8217;s books (with Emma split into three volumes).  The middle pile consists of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#8217;s books, with the Sherlock Holmes mysteries (Valley of Fear, Sign of Four, and Hound of the Baskervilles) grouped closer than the others.  The bottom pile are five of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays.</p>
<lj-cut text=""Read the rest of this entry &amp;raquo;""><p>Of course, these people are all pretty different.  As requested below by <a href=""http://theojf.blogspot.com/"">Theo</a>, let&#8217;s run it one more time, using 12 books from George Eliot, Jane Austen, and the Bront&euml; sisters.</p>

<p><img src='http://kisonecat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/everything.png' alt='Three from the same period.' /></p>

<p>Well, <b>that didn&#8217;t quite work.</b>  The books by the Bront&euml; sisters (Wuthering Heights, Villette, The Professor, Jane Eyre) have been separated from the others, but George Eliot and Jane Austen are getting mixed together.  Admittedly, if you just project to the <i>y</i> coordinate, the authors are sitting in disjoint intervals.  Nevertheless, this isn&#8217;t as nice as I might hope; so let&#8217;s run it again, just on the eight books written by the two authors that aren&#8217;t being sufficiently separated:</p>

<p><img src='http://kisonecat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/just-two.png' alt='Just two from the same period.' /></p>

<p>I suppose this is somewhat better, though it&#8217;s basically just a stretched out and inverted version of the previous image.  Jane Austen&#8217;s books (Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma) are all up on top, and George Eliot&#8217;s books still aren&#8217;t piled together.</p>

<p>You might have guessed that I have <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/"">Project Gutenberg</a> to thank for the text files (including the Shakespeare plays).</p>

You can comment here or <a href=""http://kisonecat.com/2008/01/22/clustering-the-new-testament/#comments"">there</a>.</b></p><p>During Bible study last week, it was mentioned that people have used statistics to &#8220;determine&#8221; authorship of books of the Bible.  Having a couple free hours last night, I tried my own experiment on the New Testament.</p>

<p>The procedure was easy: I downloaded the <a href=""http://users.mstar2.net/broman/na26-l.zip"">Nestle-Aland 26th edition of the New Testament</a>; each book in the New Testament became a vector <img src='/latexrender/pictures/9e3669d19b675bd57058fd4664205d2a.gif' title='v' alt='v' align=absmiddle>, with <img src='/latexrender/pictures/8fc1c18c04aaa694c161d1c1bf61078f.gif' title='v_w' alt='v_w' align=absmiddle> counting the number of times word <img src='/latexrender/pictures/f1290186a5d0b1ceab27f4e77c0c5d68.gif' title='w' alt='w' align=absmiddle> appears in the book.  The cosine of the angle between two such vectors measured how similar the corresponding books are.  I packaged these cosines into a matrix, the <img src='/latexrender/pictures/5270ae675fac24f97e172dcd9b18fa92.gif' title='(i,j)' alt='(i,j)' align=absmiddle> entry of which measured how similar books <img src='/latexrender/pictures/865c0c0b4ab0e063e5caa3387c1a8741.gif' title='i' alt='i' align=absmiddle> and <img src='/latexrender/pictures/363b122c528f54df4a0446b6bab05515.gif' title='j' alt='j' align=absmiddle> are.</p>

<p>Of course, this is a <img src='/latexrender/pictures/935281a48ac2d3d2b14dfb50681a635e.gif' title='27 \times 27' alt='27 \times 27' align=absmiddle> matrix.  To turn these numbers into a nice picture, I projected the books onto a lower dimensional space spanned by the eigenvectors having the five largest eigenvalues (this is known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_components_analysis"">Principal Component Analysis</a>); I chose five dimensions, displayed using location (two dimensions) and color (three dimensions, namely hue, saturation, and luminosity).  The result is the following graph:</p>

<p><img src='http://kisonecat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/new-testament.png' alt='New Testament Clustering' /></p>

<p>The dots represent each book, and nearby dots of similar colors represent similar books.  Some things jump out right away:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Gospels are all in the lower right hand corner.</li>
<li>Paul&#8217;s epistles (and Peter&#8217;s?) are mostly in the upper right hand corner.</li>
<li>Revelation is close to John.</li>
<li>Hebrews and James are close to each other? Why?</li>
</ul>

<p>All told, I think this is a pretty good graphical display of the structure of the New Testament, especially considering we used nothing but the Greek text and linear algebra!</p>"

You can comment here or <a href=""http://kisonecat.com/2007/05/29/national-bingo-night/#comments"">there</a>.</b></p><p>National Bingo Night (which seems to me to be very silly, but ignoring that&#8230;) has a &#8220;play along at home&#8221; game, where you print out a bingo card.</p>

<p>How would I design this?  I had hoped that the website generated a Bingo card, digitally signed it, and then sent the signed card to the user.  If it had been designed that way, ABC wouldn&#8217;t even need to remember which cards had been generated, as long as their private key wasn&#8217;t compromised.</p>

<p>How many Bingo cards are there?  The first two and last two columns of a Bingo card are a sequence of 5 numbers drawn from 15 possible numbers, and the middle column has a &#8220;free&#8221; square, so it consists of only 4 numbers from 15 possible numbers.  Anyway, this is <img src=""/latexrender/pictures/78aff59c274c72ac3c62845b9f2b79a5.gif"" title=""(15 \cdots 11)^4 \cdot (15 \cdots 12)"" alt=""(15 \cdots 11)^4 \cdot (15 \cdots 12)"" align=""absmiddle"">, which is a big number.  In base 36, it is 18 digits long.</p>

<p>But the base 36 number below the National Bingo Night cards is only 10 digits long.  Thus, this 10 digit number can&#8217;t encode the whole Bingo card&#8212;there are too many cards.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://abc.go.com/primetime/nationalbingonight/index?pn=officialrules"">official rules</a> make this totally clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;ABC&#8217;s National Bingo Night&#8221; (the &#8220;Show&#8221;) Home Viewer Sweepstakes (June 2007) (the &#8220;Sweepstakes&#8221;) is a seeded instant win game. Unlike bingo, where selected numbers are drawn live before an audience of players who have purchased or otherwise obtained randomized cards, in this Sweepstakes the relevant numbers are known to Sponsor ahead of time, due to the nature of the recording schedule of the Show. Based upon the numbers drawn during prior in-studio tapings of the Show, Sponsor then randomly distributes a specific, predetermined number of potentially winning Sweepstakes &#8220;Game Cards.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they already know who will win, because the numbers have already been drawn.  The serial number only has to encode &#8220;Winner&#8221; and &#8220;Loser.&#8221;  Not so interesting.</p>

<p>I wonder, though, if there are other web games that actually use digitally signed objects for fun purposes?</p>"

<p>And in light of this wonderful news, why not ingest tremendously huge amounts of vitamin C?</p>

<p>In fact, I&#8217;d like to make this into a double-blind study of myself.  Here is what I would like to do: randomly take either a placebo pill or a vitamin C pill (without my knowing which I took), and record the type of pill I took.  At the end of the day, I would further record how I feel (as a number from 1 to 100, perhaps), and then do a regression to see if the type of pill I am taking is correlated with how I feel.</p>

<p>In fact, I should do this with all sorts of things in my life.  Certainly I should be doing this with my caffeine intake, because I feel so convinced that I am much happier while drinking coffee, but that may only be an effect of the coffee&#8212;which is, wonderfully and exactly, the point.</p>"

You can comment here or <a href=""http://kisonecat.com/2007/03/04/divinity-versus-humanity/#comments"">there</a>.</b></p><p>On a recent plane trip, I was reading a very abridged version of (the ten thousand page long!) <em>Church Dogmatics</em> by Karl Barth, and I found something totally beautiful.</p>

<p>Believing God to be entirely &#8220;transcendent in contrast to all immanence&#8221; and &#8220;divine in contrast to everything human,&#8221; and reading (e.g., in <a href=""http://biblegateway.com/bible?version=NIV&amp;passage=Philippians+2%3A7"" title=""Bible Gateway"">Philippians 2:7</a>) that Jesus is God having emptied himself, having made himself nothing, I concluded that God somehow <em>hid</em> his divinity in order that he might become human and, in that form, redeem humanity.</p>

<p>This is wrong.  Karl Barth writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As God was in Christ, far from being against Him, or at disunity with Himself, He has put into effect the freedom of His divine love&#8230;  He has therefore done and revealed that which corresponds to His divine nature&#8230;</p>
  
  <p>His particular, and highly particularised, presence in grace, in which the eternal Word descended to the lowest parts of the earth and tabernacled in the man Jesus, dwelling in this one man in the fulness of His Godhead, is itself the demonstration and exercise of His omnipresence&#8230;  His omnipotence is that of a divine plenitude of power in the fact that (as opposed to any abstract omnipotence) it can assume the form of weakness and impotence and do so as omnipotence, triumphing in this form&#8230;</p>
  
  <p>From this we learn that the <em>forma Dei</em> [<a href=""http://biblegateway.com/bible?version=NIV&amp;passage=Philippians+2%3A6"" title=""Bible Gateway"">Philippians 2:6</a>] consists in the grace in which God Himself assumes and makes His own the <em>forma servi</em> [<a href=""http://biblegateway.com/bible?version=NIV&amp;passage=Philippians+2%3A7"" title=""Bible Gateway"">Philippians 2:7</a>].</p>
  
  <p>&#8212;<em>Church Dogmatics</em>, Volume IV, Part 1, page 185 and following.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My cutting hardly does justice to the original text, so I&#8217;ll paraphrase.</p>

<p>Jesus shows that God is everywhere, because God is fully in him; this doesn&#8217;t undermine omnipresence, instead, it strengthens it: the abstract &#8220;God is everywhere&#8221; is emphasized by a particular &#8220;And look, God is there&#8212;it&#8217;s Jesus.&#8221;  Similarly, Jesus shows that God is all-powerful, because God triumphed in him in spite of weakness.</p>

<p>I had been thinking that Jesus was God with a veil over his divinity, when in fact, Jesus is God proving just how totally divine he is.  <b>For a God who is Love, the incarnation isn&#8217;t a denial of himself, but an affirmation of who he had been all along.</b>  It is often said that Jesus proved his divinity by rising from the dead; it ought to be remembered that he proved his divinity by being able to be obedient to death in the first place.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful perspective from which to understand the hypostatic union; the monophysites believed that Jesus&#8217; humanity undermined his divinity, while as Barth explains, <b>Jesus&#8217; two natures are not only compatible, but necessary.</b>  This is another example of the sort of paradoxical argument I usually find unreasonably compelling (e.g., Chesterton&#8217;s <em>Orthodoxy</em> or Kierkegaard (<em>fear and trembling</em> appears in <a href=""http://biblegateway.com/bible?version=NIV&amp;passage=Philippians+2%3A12"" title=""Bible Gateway"">Philippians 2:12</a>&#8212;a coincidence?) or Hume&#8217;s compatibilist explanation of free will).</p>

<p>Like most things viewed with hindsight, this perspective isn&#8217;t radical, but I (and probably a lot of people) view the divine and human natures of Christ as, essentially, in conflict when, ironically, Jesus came to reconcile those two natures, and did so first in himself.</p>"

<p>The Bible is a particularly easy text to work with, since corresponding sentences are marked (i.e., with the same chapter and verse numbers).  I downloaded a copy of the Hebrew Bible and the King James&#8217; Version, and looked at <a href=""http://biblegateway.com/bible?version=NIV&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+6%3A4"" title=""Bible Gateway"">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>.</p>

<p>For each word in Hebrew, I found all the other verses with that word, and gathered together all the corresponding English verses; by picking the most popular word from those English verses (ignoring &#8220;the&#8221; and &#8220;and&#8221; and such), I found a pretty good translation of the original Hebrew word.  In short, I picked the most popular English word in all those verses containing the non-English word.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s <a href=""http://biblegateway.com/bible?version=NIV&amp;passage=Deuteronomy+6%3A4"" title=""Bible Gateway"">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, with the top six English words underneath each Hebrew word:</p>

<p>Remember to read this from left-to-right.  Pretty impressive&#8212;it didn&#8217;t quite get the verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1430;&#1506; but it did well enough anyway.</p>

<p>It also works in Greek.  Here&#8217;s <a href=""http://biblegateway.com/bible?version=NIV&amp;passage=Galatians+3%3A26"" title=""Bible Gateway"">Galatians 3:26</a> with the most popular English words underneath each Greek word.</p>

</tr></table>

<p>It didn&#8217;t quite figure out &#948;&#953;&#8048; is <b>by</b> or <b>through</b>.</p>

<p>In the end, this isn&#8217;t shocking, but it&#8217;s surprising how easy it is: the Ruby program to do this is only 150 lines long (which includes the code to print out those nice HTML tables with Unicode).</p>"

I calculated its singular value decomposition (supposedly this is &#8220;latent semantic analysis&#8221;), and then took some dot products (calculating the &#8220;correlation&#8221; of chapters)&#8230;</p>

<p>Anyhow, the result was astounding!  The following table gives, for each chapter, a list of those chapters for which the given chapter is the chapter most highly correlated with it.  Ah, that&#8217;s confusing; as an example to clarify this, the chapter most similar to chapters six, seven, eight, and nine is chapter one.  With that, here&#8217;s the data:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Chapter 1:</td><td>2, 6-9</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chapter 5:</td><td>11</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chapter 7:</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chapter 10:</td><td>12-15, 34, 36, 46, 49</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chapter 11:</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chapter 15:</td><td>16</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chapter 21:</td><td>3, 22</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chapter 22:</td><td>4, 17-33, 35, 38, 44</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chapter 36:</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chapter 37:</td><td>43</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chapter 40:</td><td>41, 45, 47, 50</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chapter 41:</td><td>39</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chapter 45:</td><td>37, 42, 48</td></tr>
<tr><td>Chapter 50:</td><td>40</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The shocking thing is that <b>for 21 chapters of Genesis&#8212;for nearly half the book&#8212;the most highly correlated chapter is chapter 22&#8212;the binding of Isaac.</b>  In my mind, that story is the most powerful in Genesis, central to the message, and so it is especially remarkable that this crazy game with matrices also &#8220;detected&#8221; that most of Genesis clusters around that story.</p>"

<ul>
<li>The bus travels for one unit of time,</li>
<li>I will get on the bus at a random time (uniformly distributed),</li>
<li>I will leave the bus at a random time (independent, unformly distributed).</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the probability that I am on the bus at time <img src='/latexrender/pictures/e358efa489f58062f10dd7316b65649e.gif' title='t' alt='t' align=absmiddle> is <img src='/latexrender/pictures/59685f2853dbbfd24c321632c2bd5a0e.gif' title='p(t) = 2 \cdot t \cdot (1-t)' alt='p(t) = 2 \cdot t \cdot (1-t)' align=absmiddle>.

<p>I would enjoy riding a bus from the start to the end, and seeing how accurate this is, though tragically, I rather doubt it is very accurate at all.  For starters, the entrance and exit times are correlated (who gets off the bus one stop after they get on?), and there are places where people are more likely to enter, and where people are more likely to exit.  In fact, upon further reflection, this is a <em>horrible</em> model of bus ridership.</p>

<p>But, if you, say, averaged all the bus routes to make the entrance and exit distributions more uniform&#8230;&#8212;is there anywhere I can get this data?  Wait, wait, this seems like an awful idea: I&#8217;d better stop now.</p>

<p>Thanks to Bryce Johnson for pointing out a mistake in my calculation of the probability <img src='/latexrender/pictures/0c39998f20890f453c04daac4baf8722.gif' title='p(t)' alt='p(t)' align=absmiddle> above&#8212;I had forgotten to include a factor of two!</p>"

<p>Anyway, I was also happy to realize (at a recent retreat) that clothing is nicely categorized by how many disks must be removed from a sphere to produce the particular clothing item.  For some examples, consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>A sock or a hat is a sphere minus a disk.</li>
<li>A headband (or tube top) is a sphere minus two disks.</li>
<li>Jeans are a sphere minus three disks (the fabled &#8220;pair of pants&#8221;).</li>
<li>A shirt is a sphere minus four disks (the &#8220;lantern&#8221;).</li>
<li>A bathing suit is a sphere minus five disks.</li>
<li>A fingerless glove might be a sphere minus six disks.</li>
<li>Two fingerless gloves connected by a band is a sphere minus 11 disks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another lovely example is that of some scarves, which are a projective plane minus a disk (i.e., a Mobius strip), and therefore sit flat against one&#8217;s neck.  I would be very interested in owning more non-orientable clothing (someone, somewhere, must own a non-orientable tank top&#8212;though perhaps that mythical object would be too annoying to be allowed to exist).</p>"

<p>Doing a linear regression in <a href=""http://www.r-project.org/"">R</a> gives the red line, or in symbols, <img src='/latexrender/pictures/ecce4ba6728fdd6035db745332140834.gif' title='f(x) \approx 5,800,000,000 / x^{1.029}' alt='f(x) \approx 5,800,000,000 / x^{1.029}' align=absmiddle>.  Rather humorously, this means that <img src='/latexrender/pictures/d24ff4829ac446843edcb5a547b6834c.gif' title='f(a)/f(b) \approx b/a' alt='f(a)/f(b) \approx b/a' align=absmiddle>.  In the end, this is not so surprising: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's_law"">Zipf&#8217;s law</a> says that, in a corpus of naturally occuring text, the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank; here, we have a similar phenomenon at work: <strong>roughly, the popularity of a number is inversely proportional to its size.</strong></p>

<p>In other words, while the number of integers expressible with fewer than <em>n</em> bits grows exponentially in <em>n</em>, the number of pages discussing integers expressible with fewer than <em>n</em> bits grows <strong>linearly</strong> in <em>n</em>; being silly, I&#8217;d say that this is an asymptotic version of the claim that most large numbers are uninteresting.  After all, <strong>popular numbers have a lot of fan sites.</strong></p>"

Did Greek science know about it?  Any medieval experiments with static electricity?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s sort of interesting that people knew about magnetism and electricity for hundreds of years before finding many good uses for that knowledge (granted, compasses and potentially batteries for electroplating, but these things are trinkets in our modern world so dependent on electricity); in contrast, the span between radiation and harnessing nuclear power was much shorter (although maybe our modern uses of nuclear power will seem like mere trinkets compared to the awesome uses to come).  I guess this isn&#8217;t surprising&#8212;-eh, nothing I say is surprising!</p>

<p>And after listening to Sufjan Stevens&#8217; &#8220;A Good Man is Hard to Find,&#8221; I read the short story with the same title.  I find myself liking &#8220;Seven Swans&#8221; more and more, and the short story by Flannery O&#8217;Connor was quite interesting.  The short story of the crane wife (which is used to good effect on the Decemberists new album of the same name) is quite beautiful, too.</p>

<p>And last night, while doing some mathematics, I was also listening to an audiobook (well, podcast) rendition of Plato&#8217;s <em>Republic</em>; I had forgotten the thing about the ring that turned people invisible!  It&#8217;s funny enough that this gets picked up in the <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, but just the <em>idea</em> of such a ring is so provocative&#8212;-where did the idea come from?</p>

<p>And earlier this week, I was reading about king David&#8217;s &#8220;mighty men&#8221; and about the beautiful Abishag.  I find it amusing how the names of these people (e.g., Glaucon in <em>The Republic</em> or Abishag) get remembered, with fame far beyond their expectation, I&#8217;m sure.</p>"

Saying &#8220;numeric value&#8221;just begs the question (after all, then why those values?).</p>

<p>It also seems a bit odd that Twinkle Twinkle Little Star is song for the alphabet.  It also seems like the alphabet song should be related to the zed/zee distinction.</p>

<p>The PawSense website suggested that cat paws are very broad, and usually strike nearby keys simultaneously.

(The &#8220;mountain of misery&#8221; belongs in a fantasy novel.)</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of people in California I would still like to see.</p>

<p>Here is a <em>really</em> stupid question: If I have a wire (with a changing current) and I bend it around, and measure the induced current in (a finite number of) neighboring coils, can I determine anything about how I have bent the wire?  Being more ridiculous, I will weave together wires to make fabric.  How do the electrical properties of the fabric relate to its shape?  That is, if I run current along one wire, and measure the induced current in other wires, can I deduce anything about how I have bent the fabric?</p>

<p>It strikes me as amusing to measure the speed of something by, say, attaching a magnet to the wheel and then seeing how quickly the magnet is moving past a coil.  I wonder how sensitive this would have to be, say, to work as a bicycle speedometer.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is the stuff that bothers me on the bus.  Right now, it is my inability to produce more examples of hyperbolic n-manifolds that is bothering me.</p>"

<p>I ended up talking Route 22 on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_Transit_Authority#Bus_routes"">VTA</a>, and then walking a few miles to go here, in the dark, using GPS to guide me.  I was amazed that this method worked!</p>

<p>I guess I should warn you that I am about to reveal plot details of Dan Brown&#8217;s books.</p>

<p>I read <em>Digital Fortress</em> by Dan Brown, which was an unfortunate use of time.  That book, for starters, is isomorphic to the Da Vinci Code; they are both about a female cryptologist, who gets involved with a university professor, who is himself dragged into a global conspiracy.  Humorously, at one point, they use a 5-letter password (which just happens to the female cryptologist&#8217;s name, just like in the Da Vinci Code).  And like every Dan Brown book, this book also happens to begin with someone dying, who, as the holder of a secret, tries to reveal his secret before he dies.</p>

<p>The more unfortunate thing was the portrayal of mathematics and computer science in <em>Digital Fortress</em>.  Terrifying, really.</p>"

<p>And I spend quite a bit of time brushing my teeth everyday, but I rather rarely discuss toothbrushing technique, or, for instance, how I learned to brush my teeth.</p>"

<p>It&#8217;s great to read the comments and find out what users wish were different: a lot of people don&#8217;t just want to <em>Unclose Window</em> but also <em>Unclose Tab</em>.</p>

<p>For me, I really would have liked to have <em>Unclose Window</em> be underneath the Edit menu, but because the undo hierarchy is linked to the window (i.e., when you switch windows, the possible things you can undo changes) it isn&#8217;t possible to undo the very destruction of the window itself.</p>

<p>The whole idea of &#8220;undoing&#8221; something is very amusing, especially the modern sense; the old sense of &#8220;undoing&#8221; something by destroying it is quite dissimilar from the idea of restoring to a previous state.</p>"

"event","So today I was awesome because I turned in my overdue library book while I was listening to my iPod.

On my way out of Regenstein Library, I continued to listen to my iPod as I walked through the book theft detection gate.  And suddenly my ears were filled with the most terrifying, high-pitched noise---apparently my iPod, or more likely just the headphones, were picking up the field used to activate the tags on the library books...

Horrible, horrible!  And it was then I knew what it will be like for the cyborgs in the future.

I only wish I could hear the lightning in the same way (I really must get myself a pick-up coil; I have long wanted to build some sort of gadget with a microphone and a pick-up coil which would estimate how far away the lightning is)."

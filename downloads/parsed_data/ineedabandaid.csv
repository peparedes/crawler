"event","So this morning, (like the wee wee hours) I found out that a certain boy I like, likes me back. Supposedly a lot, but he just got out of this 3 year relationship so who knows. They broke up in March. Gato says that he still is on the rebound. I'm not exactly sure I really care though. whoops.

So that's been on my mind all day. But now Gato has me thinking weird, which I'm not totally diggin. Thanks Gato. Gah. I need a hug or something. I'm thinking of declaring it hug day tomorrow. Just cus I feel weird when I breathe now. I don't know. I'm overreacting. Like a lot. I'm  just so excited that I've found a cute rockabilly boy.

I'm just a weird kind of gal when things like this happen. Hopefully he isn't just using me to get back at his ex. gahhhhh, why must gato bring up bad things........

Somebody please write me a letter.

Lyndsey"

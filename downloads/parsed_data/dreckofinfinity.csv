"event","&nbsp;Today I'm going to set rules for this experiment. &nbsp;More like&nbsp;guidelines&nbsp;then rules. &nbsp;Structure to guide me in this&nbsp;endeavor.

First rule. &nbsp;I'm going to miss posts. &nbsp;I have to make them up and mark them as late. &nbsp;Like today. &nbsp;It's late. &nbsp;Already on day 2, but we will work on that.

Second rule. &nbsp;No cheating on posts. &nbsp;Every post I write has to have substance. &nbsp;No required length, but some kind of substance. &nbsp;No just posting so that I'm not late.

Third rule. Talk about music and homesteading. &nbsp;I could wax poetically about games, politics and just about anything else, but that's not the point of this blog. &nbsp;I can post additional entries on a day and talk about those things, but first thing is music and homesteading.

Some goals. &nbsp;Use this a way to review music. &nbsp;If I aim to review albums or composers I'll end up listening to them, and listening critically. &nbsp;Collect quotes from composers and philosophers and homesteaders that I want to live buy, or use as inspiration, or refute. &nbsp;Plenty of people have come before me that can offer, through their writings, advice, both good and bad. &nbsp;I should find it, evaluate it, and use it if it's good. &nbsp;Since I want to read more in 2010, I can use this blog as a way of tracking that. &nbsp;I want to have work to write about. &nbsp;Things I have done to talk about. &nbsp;I don't want to just talk about future projects, i want to&nbsp;initiate&nbsp;them and talk about the process.

Lastly, I want to have fun. &nbsp;It's a blog. &nbsp;It's about me and my work. &nbsp;And I want to think that I'm fun. &nbsp;We shall see."

"event","&nbsp;I never really got a hang of this. &nbsp;Never really blogged about anything because I would constantly put it off. &nbsp;But, I read a lot of blogs, and because of this think that maybe blogging will help me figure out some of the ideas I have. &nbsp;At least get them from rattling around in my head, and on &quot;paper&quot;. &nbsp;And maybe they can develop from there.

So, I'm going to follow the masses and start a &quot;365 Blogging&quot; experiment. &nbsp;My goal is to blog every day. &nbsp;I hope that it will help me follow through with other projects, help me to explore my ideas and possibly refine them, and hopefully be able to look back on 2010 as the year I started accomplishing goals I set.

The blogging is going to consist of mostly music, homesteading and technology. &nbsp;These, second to my fiance Kelley, are the most important things in my life and what I spend most of my time thinking about. &nbsp;I'm going to start blogging here at livejournal.com until I have another blog set up. &nbsp;While I like livejournal for the community aspect, i want to use a more traditional blog where I'll be able to keep a list of links that are important to me, as well as add multimedia easily. &nbsp;I'll be sure to &quot;simulcast&quot; my blogs here for my friends, and will make sure that I have linked from here to the new blog.

Tomorrow, I'm going to set up the rules of this blog. &nbsp;Not so much rules but guidelines. &nbsp;I find that I tend to work better on a project if there are&nbsp;parameters.

I hope you'll enjoy it. &nbsp;Maybe find out more about me. &nbsp;Learn something new about a subject you might not know about. &nbsp;And lend my any help or suggestions that you have."

"event","As a few of you know, the other day my iMac died a horrible death.  Thus far it looks like I will not be able to resurrect it.  Hopefully, with any luck, I will be able to pull off the files that I need to get into school again, my portfolio of compositions and other music projects.  (The ones that I didn't have a backup for)  What also sucks is that I need that computer to finish the projects, since the computer I'm on can't run any of them, because it's very old and survives only because of linux.

So, jim, what do you do now?  The cheapest mac I can buy, (knowing that I need a gig of ram minimum to edit video, and a dvd burner is a must) is $800:

Other options?

A friend's father gave me two 2.66 Intel Xeon 1u Rack Processors.  What would it cost to build a working pc (which I could do most of my work on, with only a few programs only existing on apple exclusively)? $450-550

Including:

"event","Over the last few months I have accomplished nothing.  The last time I practiced my bassoon was at least 2 months ago.  The last time I composed; just as long.  It's not that I don't think to do these things.  In fact, it's pretty much the dominant topic in my head.  But, even when I say to myself, ""Self, you should practice now that you have 4 hours of free time"" I don't.  No follow threw.

I've also been thinking about how I define who I am.  I'm not sure.  I don't know who I am, and I can't justify my life.  I'm barely making it through financially.  Scratch that, I'm failing financially.  It doesn't help that because I decided to transfer Duquesne wants all it's money...which is a lot.  More than I can even conceive of acquiring.  And all I want to do is go to a better school for what I want to do.

I need to define myself, and figure out what it is that I actually want to give to this world.  I am willing to sacrifice it all in pursuit of music, but do I have the willpower to follow through with what my heart wants.  There are very few things in life that I need.  Good friends and music.  I don't need money, but the world requires that I have some.  And that one thing is killing me.

If I could just snap my finger and, BAM!, I can just be a musician.  All I want to do is play music, write music, talk about music, listen to music.  I want to be radical, new, exciting, cutting edge.  In my dream life I live a spontaneous life of concerts, lectures and friends.  In my dream life I don't have to worry about money."

I didn't realize that I have so much stuff, and I even left a bunch of useless things at home to be thrown away.  Though, at least, most of that stuff are books and papers...so they are at least usefull and not just objects that serve no purpose.  So, tonights goal is to at least get all of my furniture set up and all of my boxes and items in the room, and be all unpacked by the weekend....I hope.

For those that want to come visit, 920 S Braddock ave, 412-731-6262 is the address and phone number.  Just call and stop by, since that is what most people do anyways.  Such as Kevin last night....this is going to be a much better atmosphere than at home, which was very....boring...for that matter.

On a side note, I would like to appologize to all friends of Mudlock if you start seeing Jason, the Sheldons, or me less and less frequently.  It seems that the xbox has seriously taken over the lives of all those who live there.  And it's all my fault.....and I very proud of it.  You would never know how much fun it is to sit and watch somebody play Halo for hours on end until you try it.

Well...thats enough for now...I'll post later when I get my computer up and running at home."

(Wow, that was a lot of commas in that sentence....and that reminds me of Accidental Death of an Anarchist, playing at the Public Theatre downtown, go see it, 12.25 per student)

So, what the hell is going on in my life.  Well, I am getting caught up on all of my ""artist"" work: composing.  I feel like I have accomplished little up to this point this year as a composition major, and for the sake of not wasting my life at Duquesne, I want to go out with a ""bang"" this semester.  So I am, for this thursday, March 26th, a new piece by Kunz...that's me....will be performed by a friend of mine.  It is a ""performance art"" style work for solo bass, which ends in a bang...the destruction of said bass on stage.  The only problem so far is finding a bass to do this to.  I have some leads, but we shall see what pans out.  If you would like to come, e-mail me (dreck@mistergone.com) for free tickets.

Next, for all of those whom have been living in a cave the last few months, I'm moving out of my parents house.  This is most excellent, as they are slowly driving me insane....or at least more insane than I already am.  i will be moving into Mudlock this upcoming weekend, and, Mistergone (Chuck) if you are reading this, please move out so we don't have to put your stuff in the yard.  I think I will enjoy my stay at Mudlock.  And, for those who haven't heard, I turn 21 on April 23 of this year...so, in honor of the momentous event, a party will be held at Mudlock, following me at the bars as per traditional 21st birthday celebration rules and regulations.  So, please come and bring gifts, i.e. alchol, since the part last held at mudlock has taken the supply down significantly.

I think I will end my update here and finish it more tomorrow.  I want to start writing down my thoughts about the world, especially art and music, for at least my own reference, and maybe for the amusment of you, the readers.

"event","Did you ever think long and hard, say on a bus ride, or a walk between classes, about doing something, and then later think that you have done it, or at least put it out of your mind and forget about it until it's almost to late.  Some would call this procrastination...and, yeah, that's what it is, but a unique form.  And, as of late, a serious problem.

So I have decided to write such things down, so that I can later cross them off after I complete them........this I hear is what is called a ""to-do"" list.  We shall see if it works.  I am full of ideas, but bringing them to pass has never been my strong point.  

So, what have I been up to, you might be wondering, or maybe not, but I'm going to tell you anyways.  Well, I have been doing pretty much of the same, composing, going to school, and gaming.

What have I done new, well, I am looking into summer programs for music, at different festivals dealing with multiple aspects, such as recording, composing, bassooning, etc..  We shall see where this leads.

Well, time to get back to work.  Maybe some day I won't post such boaring posts and post something more philosophical or intellectual like <lj user=""theadana""> or <lj user=""maudlin"">.  We shall see...we shall see....

"event","I sit here, working my 9-12am shift here at the wonderful music school's computer lab, doing nothing but watching Pulp Fiction on the new 17"" iMacs, and I think to myself, it's time for a LJ update.

So, how has life been going Jim?  Well, not to shabby.  I have been doing better at getting things done, but still have not come close to what I would like to see in my life, doing all of my work on time, and with as little stress as possible.  But, it's getting better, and I just need to be persitant at it.

What else is new.  I have so many ideas of late, about anything, from music to LARP to putting together an amazon ""What I would love people to buy for me"" list.  I want to try and implement them one at a time.  I feel that my ideas would be fullfilling to me, and so I don't want to half-ass them.  I want to use my full potential and get great success in them.

Next, I need a partime job over winter break.  I have about 4 weeks off and feel this is a great time to work.  I was thinking of applying at a game store like EB or Babbages.  I don't want to work in food or a super market.  And, I would like to be doing something that won't drive me insane with boredom, i.e. my summer job.

I hope to rest and relax over this break, write one paper, compose and play music, read books and play games. This is all i want to do, with the minimal amount of work at home and stress.

Ehh...we shall see."

Well, the matrix premiered last night, and I was there.  And I was blown away...but I'm not going to spoil it, even though everybody whom reads my livejournal I either was with last night, or know they went also, becaue they are geeks.  It's just the facts ladies and gents, so don't deny it.  But it was good to hang out with some friends I don't regularly get to see.  I wish that I was either more free, or had a car so that I could hang out more with all of my friends.  For I am a lucky person to have as many as I do.

Upcoming events will be the PSO (Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra) on saturday night, some gaming friday night, and music all day sunday.  If anybody would like to hang out during the afternoon saturday at my pad, that would be cool, since my parents are in San Diego as of this morning.  So, other than my brother, and now two dogs, I have the house to myself.  Speaking of two dogs, we were given a dog by my sister in Virginia.  The dogs name is Buddy, and is bigger and more active than Pepsi.  He is an excellent addition to the family, but is much more of an upkeep than Pepsi.

What else can I talk about?  I have decided that I will be making a website.  I have to make one for class, so I will be adapting the project so that it can become an all purpose web page.  I will still use LJ, even more I hope now, but the web page will include some other features as you look deep into my life.  (yeah I know, scary)  I have decided that I will not use any capitalization on the website, what do you think about that; cheesy or cool?

Well, I can't think of anything now, so I'm going to go and read some news online.

"event","I seem to have a problem of wanting to know everything about everything.  I want to be able to program and build MOO's, I want to be able to be a Audio Engineer, A Bassoon Player, A musicologist, a composer, know *nix/bsd/osx/winxp inside out, build computers, play soccer, rock climb, white water raft, camp, play rpg's/board/computer/etc... games, etc....

The problem is, I don't have the time, nor energy to focus my efforts on all of these tasks.  So, I am just trying to take things one step at a time.  I have said to myself, ""Self, here is a list of things that you should do everyday to grow as a musician and a person, and here is a list of things that I need to do for class/work/etc... which I will do one project/step at a time.""

So, here are the lists, for me and for you to see.

Things to do everyday (in no particular order):

Practice the bassoon (including making reeds)
Listen to at least 30 minutes of music (attentive listening, while doing nothing else)
Read a book for pleasure (any number of pages, just so I can read for pleasure)
Spend time outside (something I am doing less since I'm back at school)
Relax with some friends (something I find to be truly valuable to one's sanity and stress factor)

Things that need to be done (in no particular order):

Web page for A-Phi-O
Ushering list for Mu-Phi-Epsilon
Reading for all of my classes
Musicianship Homework
Write program notes
Go camping/climbing/etc....
Finale Project for Lucas Richman
FAFSA for this school year
Fix PMA modems
Intensive study of reed making
Musicology independant study
Self teaching of the basics of the German language
Preperation for summer activities (PGSA, Festivals, Jobs)
Figure out how to make some money so that I am rubbing pennies together to get an extra beverage during the day
Go on a diet


All of the things that I want to do everyday are slowly coming to pass, and hopefully someday I will be able to do them.  All of the things that I would like or need to be done, projects of sorts, don't come to pass quickly because I procrastinate, and socialize to much.  I don't know what it is, but there seems to be a personal issue of mine regarding being around people alot.  It is very hard for me to be alone sometimes without trying to find somebody to talk to in some manner, AIM, the keep, IRL, Phone, etc...  This, too, I would like to work on, along with my vocabulary/writing style/control of the english language, which i just thought of, and couples with the whole musicology thing (which i will hopefully sit down tomorrow night and explain on LJ for those of you who are unfamiliar with it will be able to get some idea what it is and why it is a lot of work to achieve a carreer in it, etc...)

Well...I think that is it for now.  Please, feel free to repsond to my thoughts, especially if you are confused by anything of the things that I am talking about, I love to inform people of new things they don't know about...which is why I am going into musicology, I sort of realize while writing this, along with other reasons.

ehhh.....cheers."

"event","So, I havn't really updated this journal in a long time.  This has happened, even when I seem to think about it every day or so.  But, as with many things in my life, I procrastinate, or just forget and not do it.  But, I wish to change that part of my life.  I want to be productive, yet, I don't want to be over productive to the point that I begin to loose out of living life.  So, a happy balance I seek.  And Yoda, I talk like.

So, what shall I do.  Well, first I am going to take some time to think of all of the projects that I have either taken on, or wish to take on.  Then, I want to do them, to the best of my abilities.  I have realized that my biggest problems lie in time management and lazyness.  I end up not budgetting the right amount of time and then, if I do, I procrastinate, or am to lazy to actually sit down and do it.  There also seems to be a lack of focus on my part.  But, as I said I am trying to fix that.

So, in order to fix that with my LJ, I want to post everyday, as a way to get in some practice in sticking to a routine, and also as a way to just get out my thoughts.  I truly have very few thoughts that I will keep to myself, at least thoughts that are my own.  I do my best to keep my friends secrets for that matter.

<lj-cut text=""So in honor of my new use of an LJ I will now create a LJ cut and talk about my life.
"">
So in honor of my new use of an LJ I will now create a LJ cut and talk about my life.

So, what have I been up to since I last posted a millennia ago.  Well, school has started and I am quite busy.  I am clocking in 8 am to 12 am monday thru thursday these days and it is starting to take a toll on me.  What I must work on is setting up some times for me to nap throughout the day.  This way I can regain some energy throughout and be able to make it to the end.

My courses are nice, and it's not that I have to many, but I do have 14 hours of rehearsals just for large ensembles (Wind symphony, Orchestra, and Contemporary Orchestra).  On top of that I am working hard to make sure my woodwind quintet is a success and that we get enough time in to play well.

What else takes up most of my time, you might ask.  Well, everyday I have been attempting to practice, something else I have failed to do with regularity during the last few years.  I have been experiencing success with this, but have lost it over the last few days.  I just need to remind myself to practice everyday.  Also, I must begin to make reeds, something that I have failed to really dedicate any amount of time.  This I hope to change, and am planning on doing much this weekend on that.

Also, I am forming and Orchestra, a training orchestra to be specific, with two of my good friends, but I cannot divulge to many details as it is a work in process that is left best untold until more solidified.   Also, I have been asked to assist in the East Pittsburgh Youth Orchestra (EPYO).  I will essentially be looking at being an assistant conductor and librarian.  Luckily this will be a paid job, so that is very nice.

Which brings me to another topic as I ramble on here.  I am horrible with money.  I just spend it without thinking to much.  And I truly need to work on this.  I have squandered much money this summer on things that I truly did not need, nor had the money  to spend on.

But, I have been having much success in my life with all of these small issues.  I have finally settled on a career path that I truly like and think that I am well suited for.  It is that path of the Musicologist.  If you want more information go to<a href=""www.ams-net.org"" title=""American Musicology Society""></a>.  Or, if you know me in person and ask me, or want to e-mail me, listed in my user info, I can attempt to tell you about it.  It truly is fascinating but means that I have any where from 7 to 10 years to go until I am done with getting my degrees.
</lj-cut>

Well, that is all for now, as I want to get some sleep so that I can mow the yard tomorrow.  Everybody have a good evening, and hopefully I will post tomorrow before I head off for my evening activities."

"event","It has been many moons since I have posted to good 'ol LJ.  Why, you might ask.  I'm not sure.  I think it has to do with me starting things and not finishing them.  But that is all going to change, I hope.  As some of you might no, I have decided to focus my studies on musicology.  This is going to be a rough road, to make up for lost time, but I think I'm up for the challenge, and I want to do it.  I want to do many things, and it is time I do them.  Here is a brief list.

1)Fix my money issues. (Stop spending so much, pay of computer loan, etc...)
2)Get in shape.
3)Do everything that I say I will. (Stop being lazy, or procrastinating, and accomplish my goals.)
4)Work hard on my studies, including practicing my bassoon more.
5)Stop talking so much.
6)And relax.

I'll live it at that, a short list of things to do, in no particular order at this time.  I'll stop writing because I don't know the proper way to hide the rest, (one of the many things to learn still), and I don't want my friends' friends list to get cluttered."

I heard that the bulk of the speech, of coarse, revolved around Iraq and war.  This morning I heard a ""young republican"" of the PCU type saying that war is our only option.  I am scared, really.  I am not sure what is going to happen.  I have heard from friends who were at the peace march this weekend on the southside that people were actually calling from there cars to them, calling them traitors.

"event","My parents are killing me.  For those of you who don't know the situation, because of finacial reasons I have to live at my house this semester while I'm at school.  Now, I have previously lived on campuse for three semesters and in these three semesters I got into a routine of how I like to sleep, what I like to do with my free time, etc.  My parents don't understand this.  And it seemed to all culminate into my father yelling at me through a phone this morning while I'm working in the computer lab at Duq.  He seemed upset that I was spending my nights out.  He was mad that I was waking up a bit late these past few days.  Now, you might be wondering, what do I do that keeps me out late at night.  Well, this week is the exception, because it's rush week for A-Phi-O at Duq.  And for those of you who are not familiar with Rush week, it is a week that a fraternity hosts activities every night for potential pledges, or people who want to join, to come and see who we are and for us to see who they are.  So this involves late night activities in which I only get home at 12 to 1 am every night this week.

Now, you must understand that, I work wed nights until 12 anyways, and I am at school on tuesdays until 12 usually also.  So the only days that changed were Thursday night, and tonight, Friday.  (Monday we didn't have school, no rush event)  What further fueled my fathers rage, seemed to be me asking mom if, since I changed my mind, go to LARP saturday in greensburgh instead of a Frat party.  In which I would leave a little earlier for the commute, but in the end would be home about the same time.  Understand that I do LARP every saturday normally and the first and third fridays of the month.  When my mom had me ask my father whether or not I could do this, he blew up and pretty much told me that I need to start being home more often and that I either go to the party or nothing.  I then asked him, what difference does it make if I go to LARP over the party if it involves almost the same amount of time.  If his issue was late nights, I would be out late for the party.

Now, another thing you have to understand is that my father really never asks me what I'm doing for the week.  He doesn't make an effort to see if I have activities going on that would require my time more than usual.  Normally I am home monday and thursday nights and half of the friday nights.  And on sunday all I do is music.  Well, it turns out that I think he belives that I am becoming obsessive with LARPing.  For those who know me, I don't think so.  Yes, I enjoy it, but I don't always have to be there.  Mind you, I enjoy it, so if I can, I go.  Just like if I played football every saturday night, if I enjoyed it I would try and be there as often as I can.  This also happens to be the only thing I really go out to do.  Sometimes I go over a friends house, but for the most part, when I'm not at school or something music related, which happens to be what I am majoring in college, than I am at home.

I don't know how to deal with this, and at this point I am just ranting.  Now, my mom understands me, but still takes the side of my father on the fact that I am not around all that much.   I can't help it, my schedual at Duq is packed and I am gone from 8am until 5pm most days.  Secondly, I am not in highschool, I have a license, I have many more friends that I care to hang out with, I have things that I like to do that take up one and a half nights a week.  I just don't think they realize that I am not a kid anymore, that I am an adult.

Another thing that they wanted to know is if I was offered a job, since I could use some more money, though at this point I could not fit it into my schedual, would I stop playing my game on saturdays.  This is a hard question.  First of all the referenced it to Home Depot, saying that they would hire me had I said I could work saturdays.  What I told the HR manager was that I could if they really needed it, but I would prefer not to.  And since the guy seems to like me, he said he would see what he could do.  The only reason I'm not working there, since the hassle me to come back everytime I go shopping there, is because they are doing badly as a store and the need to write up and extensive plan to see if they can even hire anybody and for what.  They are not hiring anybody, not just me because of my schedual.  And to tell the truth, saturdays I need to go to concerts.  It's not like I havn't skipped a game before.  I wasn't there for most of december and the end of November.  It doesn't kill me, but if I can be there, I want to be there.  It's somethin that I enjoy.

I don't know where I am going with this...but I know I love my parents, and I see that they want to have me do good and not make mistakes that they did in the past.  But I think they might try a little to hard.  Also, I don't want to get mad at my parents, but I basicly told my mom, when she called back after my dad yelled at me that I almost don't care any more and that I am just going to stop listening to them because I can't handle the stress.  And, as always she comes back , well what are you going to do, you can't go out and support yourself.  Well, I think I can, it would be hard, but I have some really good friends that would put me up while I got settled.  Some have even offered me apartment space anyways.  Sure, I might have to drop out of school for a year, but it almost seems worth it at this point.  I am an emotional guy, I'm subjective instead of objective, I am an artist for the most part.  An d just thinking of these things makes me almost tear up because I don't know what to do.

I don't know...."

"event","I don't know if many of you know about this, but there is a thing out there called poetry slamming.  And, no, it's not saying bad things about poetry.  It is performance poetry to the upmost level, where the poet, or person reading a poem, dives in with everthing they have in hopes that they can portray what they poem/poet is saying.  It is, like most great artforms, gripping and takes you on a  emotional roller coaster.  For, not only are these participants/poets well versed in this, there are so many ideas and concepts that cause you mind to take a journy of thought where you rethink things you have allways thought to be, and think about things you have never thought about.  It's a wild ride....

Well, what is great for this thing, which happens usually at coffee shops, and has it's origins in Pittsburgh and Chicago, is that Russle Simmons, the Hip Hop mogule, who helped fule Run DMC's beggining and carreer to it's hieghts, has created a program on HBO called Def Poetry.  It is a gathering of the best of urban/professional/ametuer/new/old/poets together and let's the perform there poets for a small crowd.  The program is recorded and then broadcasted in half-hour segments on HBO, and now on HBO Zone.  It is intense and one of the hippest things on television.  There are few things more invigortating that spoken word, and finally it gets it's chance in the spotlight.  If you want to see what this is all about go to: 
http://www.hbo.com/defpoetry and you can take a look at what it has to offer.  Also, just look it up at your local coffe house and see if it is happening.  And if your a poet...start one somewhere and let the voices be heard around the nation.

Poetry/spoken word, has one great thing about it, the people that write it are the true thinkers in this world.  I know a lot of poets...and they are the people that get me thinking, they are the ones that pose the questions that nobody else does, because that is what they are good at, that is there job, to see what is arround them and point it out by prasing or slaming it.  Give poetry a chance, and for those who  have never trully encountered it, give it a ride and see where you end up."

"event","Day's at home are always interesting.  It seems that as a child of my parents...I'm not allowed to have an opinion on things.  Now, when I am talking to anybody else, they support me having an opinion...but not with them.  Especially if it differs from theirs, and if I am really passionate about it.  I guess today, I had an opinion, and my tone of voice was not respectful of my mom.

It's not like this was a difference of opinions about myself or something dealing with my family or life.  Basicly it comes down to me defending the seperation of state and religion.  On the 11 o'clock news they reported that you would be able to park, for free, for 10 minutes so that you can view the manger at the steel building downtown.  I must state that I have nothing against this, and I'm even catholic, for the most part.  But the issue  was brought up by somebody to some goverment official that allowed this that this breaks the seperation of state and religion, a rule that helps to eliminate descrimination against different religions.  My mom, being pretty religious took the side that this man was wrong, and would be wrong to take this to court, because it was going against her rights.  And I said to my mom, no, that is not what matters, he is not concerned weather or not you can see the manger, and would support it, if it was like that across the board, (a point he made by saying you can't do this to go and see the manorah at the county building downtown for free), but that there was a crossing of that line.

This is something that can be a huge debate, but I like to point out why we cannot rule this to happen unless it is changed for all things.  I am reminded of about 4 or 5 years back in the Burgh, when the KKK wanted to hold a rally, and the city of Pittsburgh did not want to allow it.  Well, the ACLU took them to court on this issue, and it just so happend to be a friend from school's dad that was the lawyer for the ACLU.  The reason, he told me, was that he did not support the KKK in any way, but that he supported the freedom of speech, which is what he was defending.  The fact of the matter, if that issue was not recognized, such people as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcome X, and other leading figures that helped to right major wrongs, would not have been allowed to voice there ideas, and we would not be where we are today.

But, since I take this stand, I was immediately deemed inappropriate for arguing with my mom, by my dad, whom I know would support my opinion.  I don't know why though.  I am 19, I'm in college, I'm an adult by all means.  Sure, I still officially live under my parents roof while I'm at school, but I make choices for myself.  I thank them for what they do for me, and I know it would be a struggle to live on my own, but I think I could make it.  And all I want them to do is treat me like an adult and respect my opinions and respect my activities and let me have some freedom.

I don't really know how to fix this other than by waiting until I move out when I am done with school, and hope that they get passed where they are, and maybe they will grow up in a way, since I have.  My parents confuse me...but I guess that's what happens.  From what I see with all my friends...at least the artists that I know...it's the same for them.  Maybe we artists differ from normal society so much that if our parents arn't artists of some sort, they just can't fully understand us.

....let's just hope that someday I'll figure it out."

"event","Well....this is my first journal entry on this interesting concept.  Who would have thought that people en mass would swarm to a site where they can post all there thoughts to the public world.  I mean, when you think about it, anybody can look at your entry.  But, in the end, after reading a bunch of a friend of mine...I see the gain, the benifit of it.  Let's look at it this way...there is no way  for you to possibly spend time with all of your friends and collegues and tell them everything on your mind.  But what a great way to do that.  This way you can't feel guilty by wasting there time, because if they choose to read your rant about the ironies of the political manuvering of the tribes of south africa during the american revolution, than they choose to waste their own ""precious"" time.  I mean, let's face it people, what fun would the world be if we didn't have those discussions?  So, in the end I asked a friend, mistergone, if he could hook me up with a code to access this interesting concept and give it a whirl.

So, let me give a little introduction after that whirlwind tour of my thoughts about what I'm doing write now.  I, am a musician...and that should pretty much clue most people in that most people that know me don't count me in with the typical college/pop culture youth of America, what/whoever they may be.  On top of that, as you will find out by reading my user information is that, I also am a gaming finatic.  Actually, I guess that the amount of time I spend getting my geek on playing games has influenced one of my good friends to create an episode in a movie of hers about me, demonstrating this weir phenominom to the typic person.  And this geekness goes as far as LARPing...and if you don't know what that is, ask and I'll explain.

But to throw another curve ball into that, I am your run of the mill, in some ways, Eagle Scout.  So, go figure.  I don't know everything that I want to do and become, though I do know I want to play music the rest of my life...(I didn't mention it above...but I play the great instrument called the Bassoon)...and with that, who knows what else I'll do, but as long as I'm having fun, who cares.

I leave you with one last thought about life.  One day, when talking to another friend of mine, I came up with this thought.  Why can't we live life like we were kids, when the only worry in life was how long to dip the oreo in your milk.


A special ""shout out"" to maudlin and mistergone for getting me hooked to this.  Woot!"

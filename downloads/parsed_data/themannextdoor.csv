"event","I doubt any of you know because I haven't told you and have only now been able to acquire a computer for a short time.  Last Wednesday someone burglarized our apartment.  I have not labeled it as a certain race but rather someone who knows mac computers are worth a great deal in pawn shops or someone who needs drug money.  The break in was with a crowbar.  I was pretty angry up until Saturday evening.  I lost my computer and all sorts of files and downloads that were important to me, not to mention that my identity could be stolen.  So anyway I just thought I'd let everyone know that you aren't totally safe.  I kinda wish I could go back and not go into work so I could see who did it.  One of my roommates is very suspect.  On a brighter note I'm leaving tonight to come to Montevallo.  If you're free I'll see you guys tomorrrow.  peace."

"event","1. Movie reviews:  So I must say that I watched Apocalypto Friday and wasn't impressed.  Every animal was fake.  It was like stuffed animals attacking people.  It was an ok idea but needed more of an ending.  V for Vendetta which I finished last night at 3 am was awesome.  Mainly the fact that V withstood several bullets and then proceeded to kill every man with knives.  I wanted it to be real.  Then comes the best part of my day.  I finally watched Boondock Saints for the first time and I loved it.  I wanted that to be real as well.  So those are the three movies I watched in the last 72 hours.  IT doesn't hold a candle to what Brian and Joie did though.

2. Because Joie is so happy about tetris I figured I'd give this link on wikipedia (not confirming it's truth) that there are secrets and cheats you can use in the game.  The cheats are at the bottom.

2. I'm stealing Joie's numbering system.

3. Today while I was washing clothes at the laudromat and talking to my mom on the phone I mentioned being a drummer.  I also mentioned how a friend of mine auditioned for the Blue Man Group and got rejected.(see #4)  A lady was also there and as I was leaving wanted to know if I knew anyone here that could teach her 4 year old drums.  I gave her my professor's card and also told her about Memphis drum shop.  She is originally from Memphis but spent the last 10 months in Alabaster.  She said she had called Montevallo for an instructor to teach her kid.  Of course the only one they have is you know who.  Evidently he didn't have time to do it.  Thus we spent 15 minutes talking about me transferring up here from the Montevallo.  Small world.

4. see #5

5.  Do not audition for the Blue Man Group unless you have acting experience.  Any drummer without it will not be considered.  They will however be considered for the band behind the Blue Man Group.  I can expand later but I've already blogged enough to last me the rest of the year.

Since I don't feel like studying I copied Heather with this stocking thing.  I also needed some Dream Theater.  So I am watching the video of ""Finally Free.""  The song is ok, it gets very good the last 3 minutes when Mike Portnoy(the drummer) goes crazy.  It just sucks I have to let the full 11 minute song load.  I made a C in conducting.  No biggie.  I'm also enjoying listening to John, better known as Caveman John or the guy who talks to himself have outbursts in the library lab.  It's funnier to watch people stare at him.  I'm going to be nice to everyone for the remainder of the week.(or at least try to)  For all that I won't see this week have a great Christmas.  peace."

"event","Thanks to Heather for finding this pic for me.  Life stinks.  I wonder when I'll ever finish my paper for Music History seeing as how I don't she didn't give us our second draft back before the break.  I'll never finish it.  I'm also not looking forward to Thursday's concert.  It feels like a waste of time for me.  If I wanted to play middle school parts I'd drop out of college and retake eigth grade classes.  I also need to finish my composition project and practice conducting.

Thanksgiving was great.  I spent time with Karen's family doing the engaged thing.  It's not that great because now  her mom is set on planning the wedding for us without our consent.  It ticks me off.  Other than that it was fun.  I'm ready for Christmas break."

One of my roommates who practically read every comic said that when Professor X dies he became pure telekinetic energy and therefore could go where he pleased.  Thus he inhabited the man in the bed.  He also said that even though the movie killed Cyclops, The Phoenix, and several others they pretty much came back in the comics.  The movie was great though.  It gave me something to do after cutting grass from 7am-5pm.  Go see it.  I was glad they killed Cyclops fast. I'm still in Montevallo if anyone wants to hang out. peace."

"event","So since everyone else is ticked off at something I'll join the club.  I did not pass my percussion barrier.  Why?  Jay Burnham.  Ok, so I didn't practice as much as needed, but I could have had an accompainist on my mallet piece.  I didn't find that out until two weeks ago.(after I'd been playing the same dam piece since January)  So it's all or nothing.  I'll retake my barrier in the fall, pass it and then find a way to take lessons from a good teacher.  Why does the Wind Ensemble not have percussionists or for that matter why there is no one who is a percussion major?  Jay Burnham.  Go figure.  No one wants to take from a man with his reputation.  The guys at Birmingham Percussion laughed when I uttered his name.  He deserves to get kicked in the balls. To quote a fellow music major, ""How can you fail your barrier?  You're the principal player!""  That's right.  If I'm the principal player in the Wind Ensemble but can't pass my barrier there are some things wrong.  First, I either suck real bad and didn't practice.(failing was all my fault) Second, Tina should be principal player this semester.(since I couldn't pass my barrier that makes her the stronger player)  Third, because I'm one of two declared percussionists in the department they chose me because I am the stronger player.  Four, it's all legistics and the principal spot means nothing.  So either take my scholarship away or explain why I failed my barrier.  Something doesn't add up.  I'm done for today and probably for the next month or two.  Good luck to everyone else trying to pass their barrier.  peace"

"event","Well it's about time.  Congrats to Heather who got me to update this thing.  So what are five of life's simple pleasures I enjoy. 

1. silence. I normally don't find time to sit and listen to the stillness, mainly because it only occurs when everyone is asleep.(including me)

2. loyalty.  If you aren't loyal to me don't expect loyalty back.  Loyalty is the trait that pulls me to new people.

3. talent.  I take mine for granted.

4. friends.  I seem to believe that I have none, and when I sit and think about I come to find I have more than I deserve.

5. love.  I don't deserve it.

By the way no recital class tomorrow.
peace."

"event","My update again will be rather boring.  I recently watched Batman the movie.  The one with Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, etc.  I really like it.  Michael Keaton does look rather intimidating as Batman but when he is out of costume he looks old.  It was kind of weird watching it after seeing Batman Begins.  By the way, is Fantastic Four any good?  My life has been pretty good.  I finished the final exam today for Music Tech.  It was a little too easy.  No class for the rest of the week.  I still have to work though.  I'm going home next Monday and will stay through Saturday.  I'm going to be living at the BCM this fall and spring.  That was determined a few weeks ago.  I can't say I'm going to like it.  I'll be in charge of maintaining the facilities, but the rent is $25 a month.  We don't have to pay for water or power.  Just rent and the phone bill.  Other than that my life is slow.  I can't wait until school starts back.  This summer went by fast, but that's fine with me.  Oh, I bought a snare drum stand for 25 dollars last Friday.  Wizard's Drum Shop isn't that great of a place, but he practically gave it to me.  There's my update.  You can also find me on myspace and xanga(bobwiley17).  Peace."

"event","Well, if you have ever read a Batman comic book you realize that Batman Begins is really the only Batman movie that comes close to the comics.  Christian Bale is definitely the best guy to play Batman.  George Clooney-the funny but really unintimidating Batman, Val Kilmer-not really amazing, Michael Keaton-???, Christian Bale-well the easiest way to put it is that he was Batman.  He struck fear in the hearts of the criminals.  For all who think George Clooney was better read the comics.  Batman was never a ""happy"" guy.  He was very secretive.  Hands down, Batman Begins is the best Batman movie ever.(Michael Caine is also the best actor to play Alfred.)  On another note, don't go to see Dukes of Hazzard.  The only good thing is...you get the point.  Peace."

"event","Well life as I know it may come to an end.(not really)  I was planning on going home(TN) to see my girlfriend, but now I found out I may not have enough money.  Stab me in the eye with a spoon.  So I'm either going to go and try to make it on a half tank of gas(which is extremely possible but risky in my car), or I'm going to stay here.  I'd rather go, but life always has a way of throwing curves and messing up your plans.  Well so long until tomorrow."

"event","Star Wars Episode 3.  I think overall it was a great movie.  It did have some down time which was somewhat needed.  I was very pleased that George Lucas used James Earl Jones' voice for Darth Vader.  Had it been anybody but his I would have been very angry.  I didn't really like General Grievous' voice.  He breathed somewhat like Darth Vader, but not near as intimidating.  His continual coughing was annoying as well.  As far as the action scenes went I like them all.  I wish they would have shown more combat involving the wookies.  I wanted to see a wookie rip someone's arms out of their sockets.  I liked the movie, after all it wasn't as bad as The Phantom Menace.  I was pleased."

"event","Spiteful Loner
You are 71% Rational, 28% Extroverted, 57% Brutal, and 14% Arrogant.  
You are the Spiteful Loner, the personality type that is most likely to go on a shooting rampage. You are a rational person and tend to hold emotions in very low-esteem; not only that, but you are also rather introverted, meaning you probably bury any emotions you feel deep inside yourself. Combine these traits with your hatred of others and your brutality, and it seems that you would be quite likely to shoot innocent people in a rampage. Not only that, but you are also a very humble person--not a braggart at all--meaning you could possibly have low-self esteem. This is only yet one more incentive to go on a shooting rampage, because you wouldn't care if you died as a result. Granted, you probably haven't gone on a shooting rampage and probably never will, but all the motivations are there. In conclusion, your personality is defective because you are too introverted, brutal, insecure, and rather unemotional. No wonder no one hangs around you, you morbid, cold-hearted freak! 

To put it less negatively: 

1. You are more RATIONAL than intuitive. 

2. You are more INTROVERTED than extroverted. 

3. You are more BRUTAL than gentle. 

4. You are more HUMBLE than arrogant. 


Compatibility:

Your exact opposite is the Televangelist. 

Other personalities you would probably get along with are the Capitalist Pig, the Smartass, and the Sociopath. 

* 

* 

If you scored near fifty percent for a certain trait (42%-58%), you could very well go either way. For example, someone with 42% Extroversion is slightly leaning towards being an introvert, but is close enough to being an extrovert to be classified that way as well. Below is a list of the other personality types so that you can determine which other possible categories you may fill if you scored near fifty percent for certain traits. 

The other personality types: 

The Emo Kid: Intuitive, Introverted, Gentle, Humble. 

The Starving Artist: Intuitive, Introverted, Gentle, Arrogant. 

The Bitch-Slap: Intuitive, Introverted, Brutal, Humble. 

The Brute: Intuitive, Introverted, Brutal, Arrogant. 

The Hippie: Intuitive, Extroverted, Gentle, Humble. 

The Televangelist: Intuitive, Extroverted, Gentle, Arrogant. 

The Schoolyard Bully: Intuitive, Extroverted, Brutal, Humble. 

The Class Clown: Intuitive, Extroverted, Brutal, Arrogant. 

The Robot: Rational, Introverted, Gentle, Humble. 

The Haughty Intellectual: Rational, Introverted, Gentle, Arrogant. 

The Spiteful Loner: Rational, Introverted, Brutal, Humble. 

The Sociopath: Rational, Introverted, Brutal, Arrogant. 

The Hand-Raiser: Rational, Extroverted, Gentle, Humble. 

The Braggart: Rational, Extroverted, Gentle, Arrogant. 

The Capitalist Pig: Rational, Extroverted, Brutal, Humble. 

The Smartass: Rational, Extroverted, Brutal, Arrogant. 
 
  



My test tracked 4 variables How you compared to other people your age and gender:
  
 You scored higher than 65% on Rationality 
  
 You scored higher than 26% on Extroversion 
  
 You scored higher than 71% on Brutality 
  
 You scored higher than 7% on Arrogance 

So if I am prone to go on a shooting rampage.  Which one of you dies first?"

"event","So I am destined to get sick since I live in Napier on the second floor.  I doubt I will.  Who cares anyway.  I've never had the flu but there are worse things out there.  I got in a verbal fight last night with my girlfriend.  That didn't go well but we worked it out.  I'm going to see her perform in ""Step-Sing"", it's some kind of homecoming thing at Samford.  I don't hate you Ericka I've just been busy.  I didn't check my email or lj for two weeks.  I'm behind.  I feel sick because I drank some hot chocolate that tasted weird.  I hate hot chocolate.  Hope everyone feels better.  I feel great.  (bunch of losers)"

The person who guesses correctly will win $1,000,000. Oops that's a lie.  I'm glad I have a live journal.  It's fun.  Honestly though, it has been fun being mysterious, and messing with people's heads.  Peace."

"event","""I woke up this morning, to the sound; of an alarm clock ringing in my ear.  
I rubbed my eyes glanced at my clock hit my roommate, James, in the head with a sock.  
Rolled out of bed got to my feet.  
Then started anew.  It's an average day.  
I've got nothing to complain about, and I'm skating on the same route  I'm on my way. 
It's just an average day.""-The W's
I really like that song.  It's really long so I won't put all the lyrics on this journal.  So why did Earl have to die?  Did the Dixie Chicks kill him or what?  What's the point of that song?  I would want to die if my name was Earl.  So was he murdered or did he commit suicide?  I think Professor Plum killed him in the library with the revolver.  OOPS, I got carried away.  Bye."

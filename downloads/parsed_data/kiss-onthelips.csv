"event","Most people become more attractive as they get older, but I can honestly say that the older I get, the less attractive I get. I suppose that when i get my braces off, I'll be much more attractive.

I'm just stressed out because my hair is at the awkward faze and I don't know if I should just bite the bullet for prom and contuine to let it grow out, or chicken out and cut it again just so it looks good. This has been a really long faze.


I'm really happy that I have a prom date that I like so much. I'm really excited, I just wish I could find a dress, that would put a little bit less stress on me. He's so cute, he's like ""we can match!"" However, Brad and Flea(HAHAH I BET YOU CAN GUESS WHICH ONE IS MY DATE) Have like a huge track meet in Greensboro the same day as prom. It starts at 8 in the morning and it takes about 2 hours to get there. They promise that they will make it back in time, so I'm not worried.


UM WHAT APTESTING WEEK? I HAD NO IDEA, SERIOUSLY, I DIDN'T!

Also, I'm really happy to be going to prom with Kylie and Lindsay. I've stopped talkign to a lot of people from school because I've realized how fake they are and how much I can't stand them and don't wish to associate with them anymore, but that didn't leave me with that many friends at school. I'll always have the million people that I say hello to in the hallway, but when it comes down to it, none of them really care about me, I've got my good friends and that's it. However, I guess that's ok because I'd rather have 10 friends that would all be there for me when I needed them rather than have 110 friends and have two really be there for me. Kylie and Lindsay are honestly two wonderful girls that mean a lot to me because I know they aren't fake. I love them a ton.



it's 12:30 and I can't sleep.
Leigh called me about 10 minutes ago so we could have an ever-so typical conversation about APTesting, Prom, Vaginas and drinking.

Another thing I should do; STUDY FOR MY HISTORY TEST. Yeah, I should really do that. I mean, getting anything less than an A on this test is stupid becuse Kiya told me exactly what was going to be on it.

I only know of one person that flat out doesn't like me, and that is Brittany Slack. I am SURE that there are plently of other people that don't like me, but no one really comes to mind. I know that Brittany is NOT an asshole, and would never leave a comment like that, because she's not a bitch.

I'm in a really good mood at the moment though, because, normally, a comment like that would upset me and I'd be freting about who said it and all that jazz, but like, when I read it, I just deleted it without even thinkign twice and then finished what I was doing. It didn't even occur to me that I'm obviously learning to not care what people think, which is nice, because I used to take things really personally.






I'd also like to write out a formal apology to Brittany Caroline Slack.

I went to the doctor and they tested me for mono. The results aren't back yet, but they said they don't know what else it could be. However, I'm starting to think I might NOT have it because I feel a little bit better today.

Elaine's mom invited me to easter dinner. That's cool, buuut what do you wear to that?!"

"event","If you wonder why rumors are being spread about you, you should probably take two fucking seconds to step back and look at your life. You're 15 fucking years old and doing ecstacy. You're not fun to be around, probably because you're always burned out. People probably wouldn't say things about you if they didn't have a reason. I don't know why you care so much what I am thought to say. You always said that you don't care what people think, but now you suddenly care what I think about you? You know that I don't like you, you KNOW that. You KNOW that you've changed and the thought of me being friends with you anymore disgusts me because you've turned into this awful person. In the end, nobody really cares about the druggies so just get over yourself and stop trying to blame every bad thing that's been said about you on me. I've had things to say about you, and your best friend told you what they were. However, it's not like I just developed those stories out of thin air. I heard them somewhere else and passed them on, yes, that was wrong, because that was just making the rumor worse, but I don't really care, because I have no social or moral obligation to you. I used to think that you were a very smart girl, but I don't really know what I was thinking. A smart girl wouldn't do this to herself. The person that you have become sucks and I'm not the only one that thinks so. I don't really care if you hate me, and I don't really care if you believe that I was not saying those things about me, because you don't really matter to me. I'm not postive that you even have enough brain cells left to remember what it was like when we were friends. I'm not trying to make anything between us worse, I'd rather just make it nothing, just like the nothing that you are to me, and the nothing that I am to you."

(However, Joyce, Bosco & Marshall def were good competiton)

After the show, I went to CoffeeWorks and met up with like 20 people and we all went back to Kayvons.
(me, jean, rene, kayla,alyssa,katherine,grace, like 5 scene boys, geoff, meredith, tim, sarah bar & a few others).
Kayvon took off his pants, which wasn't as funny to me, Tim, Sarah or the scene boys, I guess because we were sober. It was acutally just kind of awkard. I drove a few peopel to their cars and then came home. I'm here.

Leigh called me this afternoon and I got the phone call that I've always thought I was going to get when I anwser her calls (except this time of course);; She got in a car accident. She's fine, her car is OK, and everyone/thing else is fine. It scares me a lot. I can't have something bad happen to her."

"event","When you grow up, you tend to change into a different person. Usually that person is slightly more mature, wise, and/or experienced. 

Just because you get older and change doesn't mean you're growing up.
Please realize that ""growing up"" doesn't just mean growing older.

You, my darling, are someone that I now hate. I hate what you are and who you've become.  You talk and walk like a big girl, but we both know you're not. Doing the things that you are doing doesn't make you grown up, and it doesn't make you more mature. It makes you juvenille and someone that people hate to be around. It's hard to meet people that regress in their intelligence, but you, my dear, are a prime example. You're gaining years, but you're just becoming more of a child. You're staying in the same mindset, but you're too stoned to realize that every birthday that passes isn't changing anything. 
We'll be getting ready to go to college at this time next year and you'll be lucky to make it that far.
Take responsibility for your actions, and learn right from wrong because before long, mommy and daddy aren't going to be there to bail you out. 
Grow up."

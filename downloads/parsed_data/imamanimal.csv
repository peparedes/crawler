you may not be who or where you want to be at the moment.

"event","fuck yeah sunday night was chill ..

went to some bar with the guys to watch sarah sing. took about 5 or 6 shots of 151 before we left and took a thermos full of beer for the road haha. got there, steph n josh ordered a pitcher and we realized they werent carding so he brought me a glass too. one pitcher quickly turned into 6. haha. basically the trip consisted of booze, singing, dancing, the cowboys game, fried pickles, and phone numbers hah it was fun as PHUCK. 

after that we took josh n brent back to their car so they could go to work, walked inside stephs and passed the fuck out for two hours. woke up and all the lights n everything were off and i was tripped out. so then i drunkenly staggered out and got in the protege and left to go watch CLICK. that movie was actually pretty fuckin good. i just remember i couldnt see shit on my way home and my headlights werent workin well on the protege. i remember gettin home around 630 or so and eating a shitload of leftover wendys that i was too full to eat earlier. wow, beastly amount of food.

went to the gym tonight and tryin to get at least 5 days of exercise in before i get to cali so i dont look like a COMPLETE fat slob haha, only partially!
anyways, prob goin apt huntin when i get back from my trip. so yaaaa, hopefully its a good fuckin trip. PAYCE"

it looks like im NOT going back to california. and if one more fucking person talks to me like its the easiest thing to just get up and go out there, i swear to God i will fuckin slap you with my dick. yeah it would be really easy if i had financial/emotional support from my family .. NOPE, if i had anybody that is willing to move in with me so we can split the costs of living .. NOPE, if i had friends that ould actually HELP me if i got into a bind rather than watch me resort to moving to another bumfuck state .. NOOOOPE. so until those three are solved or shit, until you wanna contribute to solving one of those three, shut the fuck up and keep your opinions to yourself. opinions sure as fuck dont pay rent, remember that"

friday .. had to drink again of course haha. finished off what was left. which was like nothing. and steph and i each had a large pizza from cici's! ALFREDO PIZZA IS A BEAST! but ya .. im tired. watchin football. gotta sleep in a little bit but i cant make myself just yet.

"event",".. as i sit here. listening to ""careless whispers"". on the verge of, i dunno, tears? i really don't even know why. maybe it's frustration. maybe it's this feeling i have of being completely overwhelmed (a feeling which i'm no stranger to). maybe it's just george michael's voice. who knows .. but regardless, i am upset right now. i feel myself slipping down the road i don't want to venture down. filling my time, my voids if you will, with stuff to simply get me by. i'm not talking about drugs or anything like that. it's just so depressing to sit here and realize that i can't even remember the last time i had something to look forward to. and it's not like i don't try and remedy the situation. i try to branch out. but i'm not the person i used to be. i'm really not. and in some aspects, i miss the old me. and in other cases, i embrace the change.

i just remember the days when i had no problem with interacting with people. none whatsoever. now? oh lord, not now. now i can't even walk into my work when a crowd of employees are leaving from their day shift without breaking into a mean sweat and putting a scowl on my face, thinking its the only emotion i can possibly muster up to conceal the awkwardness i feel. my anxiety has officially gotten the best of me. girls at work are afraid of me or just afraid to talk to me. which, in a way is cool seeing as how i'm definitely not looking for that sort of connection. but i really just want friends. guy friends. female friends. but i can't seem to meet people. other than the certain few i associate with from work, outside of work, i haven't found anybody who seems interesting or to be perfectly honest, mature enough to make me want to hang out with them. 

i always try and be like everyone else and live by the ""i regret nothing"" mentality. i have such a solid exterior. i don't like showing real emotion and i'm sure the next time i feel comfortable enough TO show any kind of raw emotion, it will be a breakdown for the ages. i was talking to stephan today about my father (not my dad, my father) and i almost cried out of anger. maybe it wasn't out of anger. but i wouldn't know seeing as how for the last, i don't know, 2 years, anger is the only emotion that i'll show besides being happy or just content. i'm not always angry. i get embarrassed, i show anger. i feel myself choking up .. i show anger to suppress it. it's very unhealthy. i choose to obsess over things like working out or writing to keep my mind focused on something; stall for a while until the next major collapse.

i don't know how to let myself just be me anymore. i cant even just stand comfortably without thinking ""oh if i stand like this it probly makes my t-shirt fit me funny, and i'll look weird. i better stand straight as a board."" i'm not in the fucking military. i don't NEED to stand like a board. but i do it anyways. and with every single choke hold grasp i put on my life, i realize i'm just strangling myself. i can't be me .. i just can't. this can't be how it's going to be forever. it just can't. i hate smiling. my smile makes me so self-conscious that i have forced frowns after hearing something funny simply to avoid smiling. or i practice the ""look down and laugh"" technique, which i've begun to master. only drawback on that is that it makes every funny thing seem like its so hilarious that i can't even keep my head up. and shit's not that funny. 

it's just tough. it's tough being at this age and trying to figure everything out at once. everybody says ""oh this is where you find yourself .. oh yeah you find yourself blah blah .."". Well SHIT! I've been looking. where the fuck am i then? anybody know? because i sure as hell don't. i do regret things. i regret having said AND done things. and i'll have to live with those regrets. but they eat at me no matter how much i try and justify my decisions .. they eat me alive. so please .. if anybody knows where the real branden lawson is located, send me a note, give me a call, something .. i just want to be happy. wanna be normal.

"event","so friday night i woke up around 10 or so. my sleep schedule has been really messed up the last few days so to wake up at 10 was no surprise, despite the fact i had just fallen asleep about 3 hours prior. i went to a friends house at about midnight and ended up watchin the number 23. such a shitty movie. i also felt sick pretty much the whole time sooo it was kind of an ""ehhh"" friday night. i got home, expecting to duck inside and be asleep by 5am (the real reason behind this wasnt so much that i was tired, but more of a plot to be asleep before my aunt came home). i found out my aunt WASNT comin home so i ended up staying up. and up .. and up. i only got about an hour & a half of sleep before work on saturday night.

work was, well work. same as always. got my stuff done .. got in, got out. went to ihop right after with brent, josh, and his girlfriend. damn bacon & egg cheeseburger. damn waiter and damn people coughing their lungs up onto the back of my head.

now im home. got about two hours of sleep so far today. hopefully ill get more before i go in tonight. before i go into work that is .. drivin there in the damn protege! its back in full effect. good times. and on one of those sidenotes; not a normal sidenote. but one of those sidenotes that only belongs in a livejournal. the type of sidenote that is so vague that nobody has any idea what youre talking about and will inevitably ask about it via comments but you post it anyways. but ya .. on one of THOSE sidenotes, its really weird to keep from investing energy into somethin and still find yourself worn out by it at the end of the day. yeah .. beaten down. pretttty sure its never been THIS way before."

"event","sooo .. i pretty much decided today that i have absolutely NO independence while living in this household. One might say, 'well of course you don't'; seeing as how i do live with family within these walls. on the other hand, its been sort of misleading. i can do the simple things... eat when i want. drink when i want. sleep when i want. but as of late the rules and restrictions have gotten to be a little overwhelming. no people over, god forbid, because remember, everyone in this house is in bed by 9pm and has the uncanny ability to wake up at the drop of a needle.

and its the little things now .. my work schedule. if i call in (which affects ME and MY PAYCHECK mind you), it is somehow the business of every elder person in the house. not only is it their business to know about it, they find it their duty to beat me down through a series of interrogations until i have given them a suitable answer to their life-guiding questions. ive gotten to the point where now ill hide out from certain family members, learning their daily schedule down to the very minute, only in hopes of planning the perfect evasion techniques once i know they pull in the driveway.

so what im basically trying to say is .. anybody in texas want to move out and get a place with me or anybody in california want to make enough of a commitment to the same idea? i mean committed to the idea, enough to where i can go to california and get things set, knowing full-well that youre gonna wanna sign some lease papers wit me. or at least gimme your couch."

decision makin never seemed to be my strong suit
like choosin a bad color would make it be the wrong suit
i was wrong too,
life is long dude
but still every decision feels like its never gonna be gone dude
and choice after choice, i quiet my own voice
to do what'll make me accepted, respected by my boys
loved by the women, in the heat id call em bitches
meet a smooth chick call her shit like my harlem bitch
thats not how i ever ever wanted to be
got my conscience on hold but its always callin for me
detached from myself, not half. i mean all of me
follow me, 
walk a day in the life
stressed about shit pack it up in the pipe
smoke it down til every problem seems ripe. so new
avoidin my own shit facin consequences like 'who knew?'
i did mu fucka, i knew the grave i was diggin
so quck to compare myself to slave way i was livin
life aint shit if you dont do you
cuz if you dont somebody else sure will so screw you
talkin myself down from takin too many perscription
pills but it kills when i start thinkin and missin
her and her smile and i dont even think i mentioned
the way she would wear her up or down with a few clips in
and it came to a point in my life i had to face it
fuck the past, cant erase it, theres the future, make it
so i made my decision, for myself for once in life
i did it once for me but for her i woulda done it twice
cuz this decision came equipped with a positive outlook
came face to face so i know just how doubt looks
and im sittin here wonderin if the decision was legit
forcin back tears sayin b u gotta quit
the way you trippin on this bitch man its sorta nonsense
but i cant and i guess that was my problem all along
i never opened up to her and my emotions were withdrawn
it wasnt fair to her so i said goodbye
and i shocked myself cuz i doubted that i ever could cry
heartless is how i felt before it broke tonight
but we gott alot of life to live so i know well be alright
you do your thing imma go head and do mine
and eventually we'll better people over time
so this is my goodbye and its my thanks for all youve done

<lj-embed id=""1"" />

The saga begins
I'm a reflection of the drama within
the ghetto I live in, niggas Moms on crack, Pops just disappeared
the first time you get locked up who really cares?
I see a little snotty nosed with his sneakers on backwards
sleepin' on a mattress when I go to make a sale
at times I wonder, are we goin' straight to Hell?
or does God realize we're tryin' to make it as well
my sleep is interrupted by food on the stove
not gun shots, we're immune to those
some of my friends first bids are two to fours
others are on the run with huge rewards
Mothers watch Son's walk through the door
for the last time 'till they go view at the morgue
life is deep, we all just tryin' to eat
rap's a mental narcotic, I supply the streets

[Chorus]
Look at my life, you see white coke and black roses
and tears shed for passed soldiers
we all walkin' the path chosen
from the cradle 'till the casket's lowered
I still got the black ski mask to throw on
but I can get richer off the tracks I flow on
I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't hustlin' no more
look at my life..

[Verse 2]
Life ain't fair, shorty pregnant with nowhere to live
sleepin' in a crackhouse 'cause she don't got no relatives
her friends wanna drink brew and beef about who's sale it is
now she's gettin' hungry, she smells the marijuana scent
I paint a picture vividly
as if Picasso's spirit entered me
starin' at the Heavens, secluded in a tinted jeep
I'm sick of hearin' eulogies
I realize my nigga Blue is - a reminder of my past like Greek ruins
yet his seek keeps bloomin'
uneffected by police intrusions
or street illusions we were consumed wit'
I've even grown away from people I grew wit'
I mean we cool, but I don't need to bullshit
my mood could switch easily from smooth to ruthless
we ain't built the same so mind games are useless
times change, like the climate I change
check the forecast, I reign

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Live niggas I rep for, deceased, I pour Moet for
those incarcerated, my heart is wit' y'all
I know at times it gets hard behind penetentiary bars
then once free you realize you're mentally scarred
if not physically, if subjected to correctional facilities
prepare for your future to the best of your ability prosper, otherwise
you've been conquered
blowin' up her mobile phone so she can send you a box
Son, I sit inside my residence
and thank God I'm blessed with this poetical gift evident in every
ghetto like graffiti and crack sales
and cabs that won't stop for Black Males
undercovers givin' younger Brothers bad stares
Fours clap, Dogs crap in the grass here
you love to hear the story Son, the saga began here
MC are fictitious yet there's actual facts here
like the Bible said, Jesus had napped hair"

"event","its funny when people find out something they need or want to change about themselves and they do it to an extreme. actually its not funny. just annoying. even more annoying trying to not get mad about it or be able to put your finger on it when this person asks what it is youre so mad about."

"event","no car. no job. no money for rent. no money for food. no money for clothes. no idea what im gonna do with this present situation. no way i can just move out. no hope for this to completely blow over. no way this will ever be put to rest. no way things will ever be like they were. 


ive come to the recent conclusion that im a fuck up. i really am. im suprised i havent dropped all my classes this semester already, given my track record. give me something positive and i guarantee you ill squander it away and sit around sulking that its gone. thats how i work, how i operate.


you know the saying ""time heals all wounds.""? well i dont buy it. if not taken care of properly, time can make the wound not heal correctly and get infected and then youll have to amputate. a bit extreme, but is it? fuck this .... the whole reason behind this post is that i dont see how things could ever improve or be back to the way they were. not after all this. so then i think to myself .. ""whats the point in trying?"" ... there, that was the point of this entry"

"event","tomorrow i will officially be 19. oh boy 19! that gets me what? oh yeah, nothing.

oh well .. still a birthday. still gonna be surrounded by a good group of friends. still gonna eat some good food. still gonna get some good dancing in. and still gonna be crunk from the moment i wake up til the moment i drunkenly fall into a slumber, hah. so far we have somewhere around 20 people going to dinner and then whoever wants to go to the club after. it should be a fun night as long as nobody is awkward around anyone else. 
i dont think my dad is going to remember to call me or anything. and to think, just two weeks ago he was telling me he was getting me the LGVX9800 phone for my birthday : 
<img src=""http://coquette.blogs.com/coquette/LGVX9800-tm.jpg""> 

crazy how things like that always seem to happen with him. i decided last night that if i get a call, regardless of whether or not i get a gift, ill be fine with things. mostly because hes a cheap ass and never has bought me anything, so it will be no big shocker. (oh and my dad is asst. chief of staff for the Pentagon. so i doubt he'd be short on money.) <b>BUT</b>, if he decides not to call/text/anything, iam going to send him a text a few days lader reading :
""you know it was your sons birthday the other day. just one of those dates i think you might wanna know for future reference.""

but thats my dad, thats how hes always been. the best thing i can say is, i definitely wont be him.











now...sidenote:

i need a job. i have horrible luck lately with everything but mostly with jobs. its really odd. but thats one of my stresses right now. the other is whether or not ill be able to pursue another year of higher education this year. stupid district rules and their decisions to make education an impossible thing."

absolutely fucking nothing ... wow, just wow. something comes up to make you question how much i care about you. i give you the honest, reasonable explanation (key word being <b>honest</b>) and its still too hard for you to believe me.


trust issues? how bout you going through my things? theres an issue in itself. 
wow ... really? 9 months in which every argument we have HAS to be solved right then and there seeing as how we share the same roof ... fuck, i dont like questioning my decisions. especially when deep down i want this to be the most perfect situation i could ask for."

"event","im at work. sitting as usual. a sense of exhaustion has just snuck up on me. maybe its the consistent working out, im not sure. either way it feels good. today is sunday the 24th. 13 more days until i officially move in with frances and carly. should be fun, and we are expecting it to be interesting.

i always come on here and say ""oh i think im over my insecurities"" or ""im gonna change how i am now"" but the truth is, i feel inadequate at times. but for now, im realizing that that feeling isnt all that uncommon. so im not letting it get to me and send me into some momentary depression as it has so many times recently.

that being said, ill move on. i dont like the feeling of not having someones full and complete trust. even though you have done and said all that you could ever say to let them know you are trustworthy. it may be because of past experiences, and it may be because of my past experiences ... chances are, its both. i just dont like knowing i wouldnt do anything to hurt frances and not feeling like she believes that as much as i do. 

i dont like the silent treatment either. ask anybody, im big on words. i dont like trying to guess what someone is thinking or feeling. i dont like trying to guess what i did wrong to put someone in the mood that they are in. id rather be told. if youre not gonna tell me, ill ask once. if you dont feel like telling me then, chances are, im not gonna feel like asking you twice. the way i see it, if someone comes right out and WANTS to understand what is wrong, whether their fault or not, then at least tell them. its alot harder to ask what you did wrong and prepare to be humbled than it is to explain to someone what they did wrong. at least in my opinion.

just some words of wisdom and/or stupidity from yours truly while sitting at the ever-productive front desk at los cab, you local racquet and sports club haha"

"event","The hardness of today
the stinging around the eyes
the forced smiles like pushing against a rock
that has fallen in the way of my life.
I'm a cutter, but you won't see it
it's only on the inside that i make my incisions, the careless slashings of doubt, of regret.
I preempt myself with failure, set myself up to set myself back
I am not as unloved as I believe myself to be, but I believe myself to be
of course I believe in myself, maybe too much, and not enough in other people, other things
I know there are things in this world that are greater than me, that's not the problem
I know there are things in this world I'd rather didn't exist, and I'm one of them
This isn't a suicide note or a cry for help, no one wants to deal with that, I know I don't."

warning me to get out

So I stuffed pillows under the bed sheets next to where she lay

light shinning from the living room, it stretched out lazily over her face
giving me away

she cut me down with lightening

"event","kward.

   i ran into James on my way to The Green Sage (my number one free coffee depot).  James is a guy i met a couple of months ago at the Queer We Go Again after party feat. Athens Boy Choir, Talon - the Radical? Queer(i guess), dance troupe and some other bands that i didn't think were very good at all - it just seemed that they were there because it was queers on guitars (too many shitty covers).  At that party, i'd gone into the bar next door to escape the torrential downpour and in the process successfully swipe a nearly full pint of brew that'd been abandoned.  James was there at the bar, at first interesting conversation and then uninteresting and rather annoying sexual innuendo and inquiries into my sexual tastes.  For the most part i liked James but grew tired of him, it seemed that being new friends would be a challenge if he didn't knock it off with the flirting.  Not particularly bad in other situations but it seemed to debilitate conversation, making it akward - not fun.  As opposed to that fun sort of akward.  anyhow, seeing James since is always weird; he looks at me with eyes so intense like he's trying to crack a code.  i don't like it.  We talk about maybe hanging out, i've taken his number at one occasion and the other few times i've seen him, i looked like i was in a hurry - at least i've hoped so - only having the time to throw out a wave and smile and carry on towards my destination.  I'm thinking, give the guy some time to cool down, he might find himself in a good relationship with someone soon, a nice intimate, highly dependent, close attached emotionally binded relationship and maybe then the next time that we see each other and make plans, it won't end up being so tense and weird.
  Well, today i ran into him.  i saw him up ahead, walking my way and as i'm locking up my bike, he's made it to where i am.  i toss him out a high-five but he deflects it and turns it into a hand holding.  It's very uncomfortable.  It's uncomfortable enough when someone denies a high-five but he was essentially denying it on the grounds that it wasn't intimate enough.  A hand holding then, this is doubly weird because he's just looking into me hard again and i'm so not into this.  Is he repeating mantras in his head about me or something?  ergh!  He invited me to a party and then another, one i'd already been invited to and it's all so weird.  So i talk a lot, take up space with my words to create a barrier between us, to deflect any silent Law of Attraction intonements that may be getting focused on me.  ""I'm here to see my partner(reminding him), this is where i get free coffee.""   He was just on his way there too.  To meet a friend.  At the counter we stand side by side and talking to madeline, i say ""This is Robert.""  Because i really think that that is his name.  She acknowledges this new information and noone says a thing about it.  A few minutes later, i'm sitting at a table when a guy comes in and walks up to me, stares right at my face and says, ""You don't look like James, I'm looking for James.""  and it clicks, oh shit, his name is James not Robert.  He'd be crazy to not to give up trying to charm me.      The crazy thing here really might be that this could all be in my head.  Suppose i imagine myself the victim of a sex crazed maniacs fantasy to try to bed me and really he just wants to be friends and for some reason the way he carries himself just really comes off wrong?

   nah.  Chris confirms it.  That guy wants me.  but yeah, he dresses drag real nice."

"event","i saw my uncle bobby, who i hadn't seen in probably like 5 years. my uncle bobby really is a sweet guy, i've always liked him a lot.  He's funny, he's sharp and he cares a whole lot about his family.  Recently my Aunt Rhonda, his wife, was diagnosed with breast cancer; it's been really tough on the family to know how best to support.  I'm actually pretty out of the family loop right now and have been for quite some time, though i make my attempts from time with a letter here and there.  Last night i was reminded again, as i often am, that i should try harder to contact my family on a more consistent basis.  My friend came to the Red Thread/Sunshine SS show here at the house (Gourmet Punx 69 Gay st.) looking obviously disheveled.  During the Red Thread set, her sobs were heard well over the band and in consoling her, it was reveled that that morning her Memaw had passed.  i too, have a Memaw, a grandmother who is very dear to me.  i must write her a letter soon!   
  So in the dream, i approach my uncle to embrace him.  I'm pleased to see him again. But during our embrace, i realize that we are in a church and just behind me, on a table is sitting a collection plate overflowing with money.  My uncle begins to talk about the blessings of jesus christ and how he has brought us together again.  Praise the lord.  I'm disturbed because i'm having old fears from when i was young and i felt like Bobby had been pressuring me to go to Vacation Bible School at Liberty Babtist Church where he has been a member for years and years and years.  i decide to try to slip some bills into my pocket while we're hugging, hopefully he won't see.  But immediately, he calls me out on it.  You're stealing from the church?  I'm thinking ""Stealing?!  The nerve of you!  You've just cheated a bunch of people out of this cash!""  But i reply, ""uh, i was just gonna ask if i could borrow a dollar.""  and holding out my hand for both of us to see, there's a huge wad of hundreds and on top is a four hundred dollar bill, which he plucks out of my hand and i say ""four hundred?  i didn't think...""  ""oh, no"" he says, ""they're real.""    and then i wake up."

"event","Happy about getting better.  Prior to getting horribly sick this past week, i was quite depressed.  i'd been stressed out about being a new parent, potentially having little to no support from family and worried that my relationship with Kalil and madeline wasn't what it should be.  What should it be?  What should i be and how should i act?  i wanted answers because it just didn't seem like i was doing the right thing.  ""i must be screwing up somewhere"" goes my brain and i was trying to figure out another way of stopping that self-judgment without drinking.  Drinking leads me to smoking and more drinking.  IT really is a doozy for me, hard for me to control my impulses to consume.  It shines a big spotlight, illuminating the hole in my heart and belittles my petty sadness.  ""What!?  THis is what's been bothering you?  How stupid and immature, how selfish!""  Makes me feel guilty for having thought about such dumb things, wasted my time on these little insignificant fears.  I think i'm ugly.  I think that i read too slow.  I can barely hear anything out of my left ear - i'm practically deaf and it causes me to look like a complete idiot when i don't understand a word that anyone is saying.  I don't understand things and so noone should even try explaining.  I'm easy game for getting picked on or taken advantage of.  All those ideas that i have for working at Firestorm are going to be bad ones.   
   Now that i'm beginning to feel physically better, i'm beginning to feel better in general about life.  I'm smart, i'm able, and i'm cute too!  I'll take pride in my failures as if they were actual accomplishments.  I'll wield the flaming sword of righteousness as i blaze my way into the new coparenting relationship that i am embarking on.  i can multi-task and still make the best love ever.  Organizer, lover, father and brother.  We craft the best from our best."

Today my head hurts and i'm sore all over my body.  i've been working so hard; cleaning houses for people.  i bike out of town ten miles into the mountains to clean one persons house for a few hours and then bike back.  ten there and ten back.  

   Last night at the This Bike is a Pipebomb show, i was feelin' my friends belly for the squirming little creature inside - a woman was walking by with a bloody hand.  i borrowed the bars first aid kit, fixed her up and we got her a ride to a safe place(at least i hope it was safe)  Typical story.  SHitty boyfriend.  She had to get away and gashed her hand hopping over a fence.  SHe was wasted.  Crying as she hugged me and thanked me, said she'd never forget me.  These kind of interactions seems so commonplace to me anymore.  I'm never surprised when i run into another abusive situation, another person trying to escape madness, hurt and scarred.  Scared and running and falling right in it.  i try to offer what ever amount of healing that i can and that's okay.  It's an effort.  i feel pretty tired myself right now and that's a frustrating feeling because i feel like i'm hardly even engaged in my own life much less anyone else's.  My brain feels like dead weight sometimes.  COncentration is hard.  No wit inside.  i just feel like staring into to space and floating in my dream, it's so easy to do.  Critical thinking is a challenge.  I'm passive.    But i know it doesn't have to be that way.  i can change that, i've just got to make a  peace with myself.  Self-confidence is the remedy.  My lack of confidence initiates this state that i'm in.  Hey great belle and sabastian song!

It's not uncommon for there to be a big show in one of the parks around town or in someone's back yard in a trailer park(like a couple of weeks ago).  Last night there was a show in Weaver Park.  Black Rainbow, Talon(new local all ""girl"" punk rock)ADD/C, Endless Bummer, a queer dance troupe and a couple other bands i don't remember.  People around here are really into their local punk bands.  There's a lot of Southern Punk Pride.  
   And just the night before we had a show at our house.  Two bands: Pox Americana and Expendable Youth.  I'd just bought a copy of the new Profane Existence because i noticed that Creosote was on the compilation cd that accompanied it and searching through the tour dates for the bands on the cd i saw that Expendable Youth was listed as playing Asheville and Chris was like, Oh yeah, we're having a show tonight.  I listened to them on the cd and they were amazing epic metal punk.  Live, they were even better."

   Bele Chere was this past weekend and if you know anything about Bele Chere then you know that for three days the downtown area will be filled with 300,000 people, all roads downtown are blocked off by music stages and it is ""against the law"" to ride your bike within that area(not that you could).  For a lot of people in this town(and this opinion seems to reflect the sentiments of the punk community), Bele Chere is quite simply hell.  There's a huge corporate aspect to it but for the most part, downtown is flooded with local artisans - the vendors lining every street with their booths - the corporate stuff lines the periphery.  Some of the local music acts are fair while most are smarmy and dull(at least to me) but the Headliners this year were Travis Tritt, The Wailers and The Original P-Funk(which only consists of like one original musician from P-Funk).  A better time could be had.  I'm glad it's over.  Saturday night there was a Queer, Trans and Allies march through downtown, this in response to recent threats of violence against Queer persons.  THe march was big, noisy and quite colorful.  Downtown at 10pm, when the march began was loaded with loaded people most of them were very excited by the parade but many many of them were drunk white men who became very aggressive.  My big sign read: ""Everyone deserves respect.  Support Queer and Trans Folks!""   with a circle A gender fuck symbol, hearts and all that.  Some guys tried to knock the sign out of my hands a couple of times and threatened to kill me.  I stood resolute and just shrugged it off but really i was preparing myself to get punched.  Didn't happen though."

"event","This is how the universe works - you get stupid drunk every night for awhile, abandoning yourself and all the things you care about giving your time to so that you can just get numb and not have to think and be responsible.  At some point, because the drinking and money spending and emotion hording is in no way sustainable - you make the decision to change.  THe drinking must stop and the smoking has got to go.  Lungs hurt, muscles are too lax and week, there is a major lack in motivation to do much more than slump around the house after waking up at 3pm.  So, during all the parties, the shows, the nights of ranting around the fire in the back yard - you've been constantly affirming more and more of that kind of thing into your life, so when the moment of cognizant discord that births a new vision and a dedication towards reaching that comes, the universe will throw some silly things your way which are not what you want but that challenge your integrity.  I swore off the drink, for my own sake and the sake of my roommates who are getting sober themselves.  And this is what the universe does - at 4 in the afternoon yesterday just eating a single slice of cheese pizza and reading a  zine (Boy/Girl #4 very good zine!) some women bring a nearly full pitcher of my favorite beer (Shiva Pale Ale) over to my table and are like, hey we're leaving, we aren't gonna finish this, would you like the rest?  And i'm like yes, and then i drink the thing and get way tipsy.  So now i'm on a roll and i make the brilliant idea to pick up a growler on the way home and a pack of American Spirits because at this point i've already started the train, might as well follow it through and make THIS my last night drinking - honest this time.  So i did and it was okay but i don't want that anymore.  i puked at one point late last night but that event really reconnected me to my original convictions to be sober and how this used to be a very important fundamental part of my politics.  i'm heading that direction again and i'm very excited to get myself back together again so that i may become an effective organizer for my life.
   A friend came to the house last night and gave tattoos.  i didn't get one.  Jasmine and Chris did.  Jasmine got a woman on her leg and she's pouring out a 40 bottle, this because Jasmine has made a commitment to herself to never drink again.  Jasmine inspires me to no end.  i appreciate that.  Chris got a sparrow on his arm.  The details on these tattoos are very nice.  
   Another friend came home last night with blood all over him from a very brutal fight with a man downtown.  The man was yelling at a woman on the street after the show they were in and he spit in her face.  When my friend got involved, the man punched him in the head and so he got him back and that's all i'll say about that.  After the fight, everyone split and it seems that the heat isn't on really but some justice was served to this misogynist yeah-dude.

"event","Happy Stonewall Riot anniversary!

   Yesterday was the anniversary of the riots that occured at a gay and trans bar in New York in the late 60's when cops had come to arrest and beat people for not conforming to the gender rules or expressing the appropriate sexual preferences.  The people in this predominantly black and latino community had decided that they'd had enough on the night of the riots and while loading folks into a police paddy wagon, one trans person threw a high heel at a cop which then resulted in the eruption of a riot and some cops got hurt.  Every year now, we commemorate Stonewall and honor the hard work that people have done to confront and put a stop to the oppression of trans, gay, people of color and all who are abused in this culture for not being what The white supremacist capitalist patriarchy tries to enforce.
   In Asheville, Stonewall is done up right with a huge rally and a march all through downtown.  A marching band led the way and queers of all kinds flood the streets to celebrate and bring attention to the ongoing oppression that we all face.  We had a huge wild dance party in Pritchard Park blasting queer hip-hop and punk beats that echoes all through downtown.  It was a good tyme.  The after party was at the Wedge in the River District where i ran into a dear old friend from Chapel Hill and we partied to the Athens Boys Choir and a sexy burlesque-y dance show.  But even in the company of so many awesome folks who seem to be really radical and open-minded, there are still dude-brahs in the midst of the fun and today i have one that needs to have some serious knowledge dropped on him.  This guy Kasey from Boston had been staying at our house for a few days and last night he crossed some huge boundaries.  Last night our house got together and talked about what we'll do to handle it and i think it's going to go really well.  Madeline had already called him out the other day for being a dumbass when she corrected him on his use of vagina as something that was funny to wear as a pin on his jacket.  She said, ""well, actually that's called a vulva and why is it so funny to you?""  and he said he didn't care what it was called to which she responded that he'd better care because it's a matter of respect for women.  Kasey is really immature and his privilege has him so blinded to the feelings or experiences of other people.  Today, we will attempt to help him grow up a lot. We are letting it be known that our house will not tolerate any patriarchal bullshit.  We're having shows now and already we've had some sketchy dudes come in and it's really a big problem because Asheville is such a major hub for traveling kids but i will do everything in my power to work with my housemates to try to ensure that we can provide a safe space for people and that when things do happen, at least there will be a strong and appropriate response to it.


     Up the punks, down with the drunks,  pull the tools outta the trunk and fix shit up!


i'm coming out of my hole.  i'm waking up now and there is much work to do.  When i left kansas this was the kind of stuff i was dealing with.  It was intense and a lot of peoples hearts were getting torn.  I'm focused for better or for worse on healing our communities and i will do the best that i can.  We need accountability in our subcultures so that we can connect beyond ourselves.  To do that, we must have personal accountability and my aim is to do that.  i demand consciousness from myself so that i might grow to be able to extend love to others.  i'm not drinking another drop of alcohol for awhile.  

   One of my favorite sayings comes from a Kurt Vonnegut novel - Timequake in which the protagonist goes around town shaking the townspeople awake who have been frozen in time; he shakes them awake and says, ""You've been asleep, but now you're awake and there's much work to be done.""  Everyone he wakes up is to go out and wake other people up from their deep sleep.  This is what we must do."

"event","Monday night i was tired by the time i'd gotten home from my trip to Knoxville where i'd gone to gather up the rest of my belongings and a twenty-five dollar check from Social Services.  i was struggling to get furniture out of the car when my roommates piling into Chris' car, asked if i wanted to go to the show.  Tulsa and some other band worthy of their high accolades, Princess Tiger or something were playing across town.  i declined because i had a lot of moving still left to do and i'd also been getting burnt out on all of the drinking that i'd been doing, compounding my frustration about not having a job and thus an ever dwindling supply of cash.  
   The room was looking good.  Things were being put into their places and i'd even done most of the dishes when i hear the car pull back up and excitedly my roommates are shouting as they rush towards the house.  ""The show got busted by the cops so we're having the show here!""  Chris is excited.  i hadn't seen him express this much enthusiasm for anything the whole time i've known him.  From what i'm hearing while helping my roommates to clear out the basement is that the show got shut down on the count of a noise violation, which is a common occurance in this town.  House shows get slammed left and right, often the life span of a new venue can be little more than an hour; this is a problem, a sort of looming crisis that weighs on the community currently since the closing of Gourmet Perks this past week - one of the only all ages show space run by all punk anarchists.  As a house, since the closing of Gourmet Perks we've talked about having the shows rescheduled at the house - an idea that is in unaminous agreement but also weary ambivalence.  But tonight, on a whim we find ourselves hosting a very big show.  The vans are pulling up and people are crowding our drive way in no time.  Tulsa comes on the scene and sets up and by this time it's already midnight.  When they play the basement is packed and there are people all over outside in the backyard.  Tulsa is amaZing.  They're fun, they're fast, they're poppy, they're great!  All through the first two sets the dancing is so lively and raw.  The third band was a group called Big Attack and my roommates Jeni and Mike are good friends with them and had somehow randomly ran into them in town while at the show that got shut down, they're from Philly i guess.  They played and not so many people stuck around for them because by this point it's already nearly three in the morning.  Big Attack's sound is really polished punk.  It's good, but it's probably not something i'd listen to a whole lot, it's hard to say if i could have any kind of emotional connection to their music outside of the live performance because that element was seriously lacking when they played my basement.  The kick drum said that they were Socio-Political Dance Punk and while it was something i could dance to, the words from what i understood just seemed a little bit generic to me.  They were fine though and all in all the night was a raging success - the fact that we could have a loud punk show till 3am on a Monday night without so much as a neighbor complaint or cops showing up is a testament to the magical abilities we possess as a collective house. The only downside was that a bunch of sleezy scumfucks from Lansing Michigan crashed there for the night and i did not like them at all.  We have another show coming up this Friday.  Yesterday we had a work day to put together the flyers for the Worker's Collective and i made patches that read Gourmet Punks with the fist spilling a coffee cup.  The website was just started as well.  Things are going well.    People are really excited about the new show space, so many people were like, whoa, this is incredible, we haven't had this kind of thing in asheville for awhile because it always gets taken away from us.
    Gourmet Punks - 1,ooo   Police - 1"

"event","Things are moving a a snail's pace but like a snail with a jet pack.  I'm speeding through my life, my days are a blur but not a whole lot is getting done.  Though i did just move into a new house with a bunch of people i've just recently met.  They're all really beautiful people though i worry a bit because they drink heavily. The house is beautiful with an amazing fenced in yard and a killer view of the mountains.  Mt. Pisgah looms on the horizon - one of the highest energy vortexs in the country as many new age gurus say.  Asheville has crystals underneath it that keeps people locked in, is the other legend.  So here we go, we're jumpin' right in.  madeline and i are sleeping in the same room still and it'll be that way for a long time probably.  We talked about getting different houses to live in or at least different rooms but that didn't work out in a way that was good for us financially, so we're stickin' it out together.  It's a challenge to thrive individually sharing so much space without sapping each other's energy.  i don't hold it against her when that happens but it does need to be worked out.  The good news is that i've been playing a lot of guitar lately and feeling much more confident.  We have two drum sets in the basement and i've been wailing on those.  Everyone in the house likes to jam and it does wonders for my soul.  We're starting to have shows at the house.  A band from Holland is coming next weekend - i hear they are great!  Everyone in the house got fired from a coffee shop called Gourmet Perks last weekend when the owner decided to close the buisness.  This is the place where all the punk shows had been playing and so like 15 touring shows have had to be relocated.  The workers have formed a Worker's Collective to buy the space and defend against this assualt on the scene.  IT's exciting!  People are getting really worked up.  Wobblies from Boston, Baltimore and Chapel Hill are coming to pitch in an effort for the organizing.  Today we have flyers to make.  Money has to be raised.  My roommates - they're celebrating all this with cases of PBR but still somehow the groundwork is going to come together.  Asheville needs another Anarchist Cooperative Coffeeshop.    Wa-hoo!"

"event","a new flame, a new passion. That deep archaic thing of raging angst against the patriarchal system of violent oppression wells up inside of me.  There's a stirring and with it a strong desire for direct action but also the patient urgency it takes to be committed to the long haul.  In asheville, my roots are digging deep.  I've already a community to be apart of.  i have many good friends here.  And in my short time here i've already had the deep conversations about the struggles we experience as survivors and perpetrators.  The word of the day is ""connected"".  See how we are all connected and how we all effect each other.  Last night, at the art auction benefit for Rising Tide i saw an old friend from Tucson.  It's been years and i've always found his work with the projects he's been apart of to be very inspiring - Sea Shepard particularly.  Well, he let me in on an ongoing struggle with accountability that he's been going through for quite a few years now.  You know the kind - boundaries were crossed, people were hurt; shitty feelings all around.  Well, what's interesting is the sad but typical pattern of how the communities that he's been apart of have handled it.  We talked for hours today about it all.  i was able to hear his take on the situation, his healing process and really how much of a monkeywrench a community of people with unprocessed issues can make it.  What's so frustrating about it is that often a community, if they aren't outright ignoring an issue, then in an attempt to prove their righteousness, they will be completely and unrationally aggressive and paternalistic which makes things so much more difficult on perpetrators and survivors alike.  It's hard to reason with people who don't give a shit about your actual growing process and attempts to understand the boundaries that have been crossed and that goes for perps and survivors.  Survivors tend to get swept up in the madness of people who speak for them and claim to be allies for their own selfish gain.  it's a fucked up sense of solidarity!  This issue is so huge, so huge because of all of the nuances that need to be taken into account.  No two incidents are the same and it's tough to validate everyone's feelings and still effectively take action to hold folks accountable.  For this, i find it extremely important for people to research Restorative Justice and see how models like that can work.  i believe that it is the closest thing to the kind of healing processes that we'd like to see in our communities.  Unfortunatly because so many people are so narrow minded and transcient in our scenes, folks don't usually have that sort of interest or commitment for growth.   I'm finally starting to feel like i'm ready to work on a new zine project - one that will be bigger and more important than anything that i've done before.  It may take a year to pull this together because i want to do it right.  But i think that i can break some new groung with this.  There are a lot of conversations that need to be happening and some of the best stuff that i've heard from people is coming from folks who've been marginalized from their activist communities and this goes for both perpetrators and survivors alike.  Survivors seeming to be the most prominient of those.  When situations of assualt and abuse surface in our communities, i see it as an opportunity to highlight the abuses that the community as a whole perpetuates, focusing in on how we relate to each other in our day to day lives and in our organizing as radical anarchists and so on.  That, is some heavy work to take on and it's something that will make you unpopular quick if you dare to take it on.  So please, dare to take it on with me and lets start somethin'.   


Yeah, that Rockefeller Grave is in the Lakeside cemetery in Cleveland.  It's a hideously gigantic phallous - a half-sized washington monument.  i paid homage to the tyrannical billionare who was a major figurehead for capitalist greed and violence by taking a big leak on his grave.

       It's gonna be like this.  Wake up, eat some yogurt and nuts and then chill till lunch, when i'll be eating brown rice and veggies.  yum.  Dinner, beans and rice.  The next - the same thing pretty much with slight variation, until i get this thing right.  i have a list of what i can and cannot eat.  No alcohol, no smoking - not anymore.  I'm candida fasting.  Killing off the out of control yeast in my body.

And now i intend to fail at those things.  Fail like hell.  I'm going to be a horrible failure at eating crap food and not taking care of my body.  Embrace failure!  

       Asheville is nice.  Many dogs would love to take a bite out of me in this town; many cops will want to as well.

   Cleveland.  At least you have train tracks to walk when all the stores are closed and there isn't a house party in sight at 2 in the morning.  i think i'm the only bike rider on nights like tonight with as much passion to want to see the world roto-tilled into something we can plant our seeds in.

"event","blargh!   this moving thing is stressing me out.   That and trying not to eat sugar anymore, or bread.   I'm having withdrawls.  I'm trying to slow down on the coffee as well.  It's hard.   Tonight after work the super rich totally going to prison next month for drug trafficking owner invited me up to her loft for a party.  I was nervous like, ""eh, did you forget that I was a geek or somethin'?""  but still i went.    I figured I should challenge myself.  Yeah folks, that is how lame I've gotten.  So lame that simply going to a party seems like such a hufe risk to take these days.  I was tellin' myself to live a little, be social, rub elbows with the cool knoxville hip crowd.  My fear was really of myself.  I knew there'd be alot of alcohol and that didn't really bother me so much since I've pretty successfully stopped drinking and haven't actually been drunk for the better part of a year.  I knew there'd be alot of pretentious people as well and that was really just fine by me because I knew how to socialize with such creatures as though their existence wasn't totally disgusting to me, that was easy, I simply ignored them or otherwise became obnoxiously attentative to them in an overbearingly sarcastic sort of way.   No, none of these things posed any threat of deterant.  what worried me was that there would be sugar present at the party.  Sugar is that one guest who comes to every party, seems harmless and can be quite enjoyable to be around but is really stealing all of your shit and trashing your place.   My place is my body; my temple.  Sugar is enemy number 1.   Sugar steals nutrients from your body and is the leading cause of pretty much all ailments.  Is it any wonder that sugar is in almost everything that the capitalist society would have us consume?
       So I went to the party.  They had to buzz me in.  I took notice of the huge gaping hole above the entrance where a few months earlier feds had unveiled a couple of tons of pot leading to the indictment of one of knoxville's most prominent and well loved young entrepanuers.   The man now sits in a prison waiting out his 6 year sentence while his wife is still throwing big parties in their expensive market square loft.  but she'll have a new home in a month or so.   and yeah, you read that right, that was two tons of pot.  tons.   what does that even look like?  a large uhaul or something?    Inside I was pretty amazed by all the crazy artwork and fancy designer everything.  On a bar sat alot of delicious looking food and to make this short, I'll say I ate some chocolate and ruined my sugar fast.
    I left shortly after breaking my integrity and a little friendly banter with some of the folks who worked at the Preservation Pub, who were all opening presents.  They had all drawn names and were exchanging gifts.   I thought, ""Oh great, I get to stand around and watch people open up presents that I don't get to have.""   and then I was disturbed that I'd actually thought I'd want any of that crap.   It was all mostly alcohol related stuff.   and i just didn't drink.  normally.  I edged toward the door after I spoke these exact sentiments to another fella who stood watching the crowd of Oooing  aaahing drunks unwrapping their gag gifts.  he seemed unmoved by my profound quiery for escape.  I bolted towards the bar for another handful of chocolate covered pretzels before taking leave.  I siezed the pretzels and then turned to see Fredrick the Austrian man whose packages from UPS I am used to receiving for him downstairs in the gift shop.  He's a very mysterious personal fitness trainer who always brings strange new women into his apartment with him but first always stops by the store to ask for his oddly shaped packages.   He was standing by the bar, unconcerned with the items that lay there.  He had some lady who looked like god must be continuely airbrushi........

goodnight.   it is late.            enough for stories.   all you should know is that people were somewhere and things were done."

F this place!   The only things i ever do around here is yoga, work and the feminist book club which is lame because it's only once a month and i hardly ever see those people any other time.   Knoxville sucks.  I'm joining the rest of all cool kids who either move out or just always have avoided this town.  good bye and good riddance! just two more paychecks and i'm gone!"

"event","I'd like to get clear about my purpose in life.   Clarity comes to me when I meditate.  I do it alot these days but I still slip and my mind goes numb and I feel slow and dumb alot.
  It's scary
    I come up with good excuses for maintaining the shitty feelings.  like it's from all the pot that I smoked out of aluminum foil bowls as a kid.


Yesterday was my birthday.  And true to form like most people in western culture, I decided to close my awareness off from myself and self inflict some damage.   I didn't do it with alcohol.  I did it with refined sugar.  A red velvet cake did me in.  My friend Paisley's birthday is also Oct. 3rd and she invited me over for cake, which we ate and ate and did not stop till it was all gone.   And then we lay on the floor for the next few hours feeling sick, our minds reeling from the crazy sugar high.

   Everything other than all the junk food was really great about my birthday except for coming home last night and feeling really sexy and playful and not communicating very well with Madeline.  I had just returned from a really high energy yoga class and an hour bike ride that had me feeling clear headed and good about the world.  When I came home madeline and i talked for awhile and I gave her a massage and feeling like taking it a little further I asked her to please tell me if and when she wanted me to stop and what wasn't okay and I alos kept in mind our joint understanding that some parts of the body require specific permission for so I didn't go there but I was really in a sexual mood and she kind of let it go on and I could have keyed in that she was a little unclear with her expressions for just a massage and that I was a little bit in my own world, which doesn't equal healthy sexual relationship.   When I got up to get some water we both had a bit of time to focus and we stopped and talked about it.  We both got triggered by that experience, boundaries were crossed as a result of our disconnection in that particular moment and though it didn't go beyond being an erotic massage, the thought to her of allowing me the chance to go on so unaware with such vague intentions and passive acceptance was a really hurtful realization.   she said she was a little scared.   and i felt like a rapist and got really scared too.    It's a little extreme but maybe not so much.  It just highlights just how crucial it is that we stay sharp and really strive to understand each other.      Before that whole instance we'd not been expressing ourselves so clearly and then we were provided with a situation which allowed us to open up and it was really healthy and awesome.  I could go on but there is a kitty in my lap now and she demands my attention.


  please respond if it moves you to.  I'm very open about my sexual life and take seriously my responsibility for it.  If this were like some really wicked fucked up shit where I'd been really super abusive I'd still share it so don't think I'm glossing anything over here.  Any perceived glossing is most likely a result of my poor grammar or my lack of motivation to really want to be so detailed on this subject because I just want to ride my bike into town right now and sit at a coffee shop and eat fuckin' choc. chip muffins and read my michelle tea book and be pouty and crabby because I'm 23 and still don't have it all figured out yet.  boo-hoo.


                i've talked about it all.  who's to blame.  it's the ever looming patriarchy.  it's my fuckin' fault and saying i feel bad is an attempt for pity and on and on.  It's all of those things.  It's stops because i say it does and because i'm not participating in the bullshit any longer.  and i'm glad for the mistakes. last nights mistake made us stronger for sure.  it gave me a good contrast to see what i could be when i don't pay attention, when i give up and surrender to old habits of the mind which is a product of patriarchy.  But now it's a product of self-development which doesn't put up with bullshit.



                          the awesome part is that it all gets better.

Ever since my friend venessa gave me Written on the Body, I've read a few other Jeanette Winterson books because now I'm obsessed with her writing and there's a line Lighthouse Keeping that goes:  ""Even the worst of us are lucky because the sun always rises>"""

"event","Last night was intense.
  Tragedy played a show in Kansas City, the Kansas side.  I was naturally really excited to get to see Tragedy because the political hardcore style that they champion has been of great inspiration to me in the past.  I had thought that they wouldn't be doing shows anymore from an article in Inside Front that I had read a couple of years ago that had Todd(vocals/guitar) saying that he didn't think they'd ever play again.   Must've been a hoax or they changed their minds because not only have they made a new full length but are also touring all over the states now.
  I happened to be in the right place at the right time.  It was only thirty-some miles to  where the show was to be played and finding a ride there was easy enough because there were alot of kids from Lawrence who were going.  Sarah and I with our Ukaleles packed into a car with Kalila and Nick  and took off for the show at the Anchor.  This place is a small venue run by a straight edger in the industrialized area of KC called ""the Bottoms.""  I practiced on my new Ukalele out front with Sarah while waiting for the show to start.  She taught me a Tom Waits song.
   Monsters in the Basement opened up with a funny set of metal songs about star wars and then Nothing Else played.  This is the second time I've seen nothing else and they were way better the second time, the energy was really  high as there were alot of kids at the show and everyone was just going crazy.  It was an emotionally charged show because a kid that alot of people were friends with from Columbia named Mike had killed himself the night before and so people were really upset and feeling freaked out and vulnerable and that feeling just spread throughout the room and the mosh pit was especially agressive.  Normally I would make a really big deal about macho-punks dancing too violently and taking all the fun out of the show but this felt different, alot of people there were trying to get something out, trying to give the pain an outlet.  There were alot of kids crying and flailing around and still there were those macho-punks who just acting like jerks too but they were tolerated.  Graham, who sings for Nothing Else was his awesome usual uplifting self.  In between songs he'd say ""you guys are my best friends, thank you for coming; ya'll are so awesome, I love you.""  and then break out into a blood curddling scream backed by the band who thrashed us all into a frenzy.
   Nothing Else was followed by Dick Cheney's Dick which it was made known happened to be Mike's favorite band and they dedicated their songs to him and played a really passionate set.  During one song the room split in two and we formed a wall of death on each side and then charged into each other.  Bodies were laid out all over the floor as the melee that ensued tore through the room and I suffered a leg injury from that.  It's swollen and bruised but okay.
   When Tragedy went on they asked us politetly not to bash their teeth in and so people had to form a wall between the band and the crowd so that they wouldn't get knocked over.  For the most part it was successful but there were still a few instances of flying punks breaking through and landing on the bassist."

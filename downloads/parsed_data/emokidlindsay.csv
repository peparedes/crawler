All I Want Is a Beer! 

A man was out of town on business. While sitting around his hotel he became bored. So he thought to himself, ""Hmm, a beer would be really nice right now."" So he began to wander the streets of the unfamiliar city, looking for a bar. And, after a few minutes he came across one. He casually went inside and took a seat at the bar. 
The bartender walks up and asks the man what he is drinking. Anxiously, the man says, ""Bud Light please."" 

The bartender then asked what the name of his penis was. The man looked at him with confusion and said, ""What are you talking about? All I want is a Bud Light and, besides, I have no name for my penis."" 

The bartender, calming the man, said, ""Look around, all you see is men. That is because this is a gay bar. And the tradition is, when you order a drink, you state the name of your penis. Then I'll serve you a drink."" 

The man, really thirsty for a beer, now says, ""Fine. Give me couple of minutes to think, and I'll order when I come up with something."" 

So he is thinking about it for a couple of minutes and still can't come up with anything. So he decides to ask the guy next to him for an idea. The man states, in a feminine voice, ""Well I call mine Timex, because it takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin."" 

The man quickly turns away and asks another man to his right. That man states in a deep, gruff voice, ""I call my Ford, because it is built ram tough. Have you driven a Ford lately?"" 

Again, the man quickly turns away. Then, suddenly he says, ""Bartender, come here, I am ready to order."" 

The bartender says, ""What'll ya have?"" 

The man says, ""A Bud Light please."" 

The bartender asks, ""What is the name of your penis?"" 

The man responds, ""Secret... strong enough for a man but made for a woman."""

"event","SO tomorrow marks an important day in my life, simply because my love interest of two years will be turning 18. thereby leaving me in a cloud of illegal dust.

But in all seriousness; Ashley Doukas is my very best friend and can make me laugh harder, think more clearly, enjoy life, etc etc more than any other person on earth. I am the luckiest girl alive. We rarely fight, and when we do it's over cute things like us not being able to spend enough time together, or me dating drug addicts. I know that I can tell her anything and she will still LOVE me more than she loves any of you trashy ass bitches. THANK YOU.
 

Happy Birthday, Ashley! I love You :]

AND because my little brother has apparently downloaded every virus known to man, rich text wont work, so I will instead send you a Link to the best picture of DOUKABALLA ever taken. I call it, ""Ashley loves them goddamn JEWS!"" enfuckenjoy.

In the past month I have:
gone to school :)
worked.
had little to no time for anyone
had ANOTHER boyfriend choose drugs over me :(
decided that i really love new england
fought with my mom/everyone on earth
had the most embarrassing things said about me at school
felt like an ass
picked apples
Died TWICE in one incredibly ridiculous play.
watched a couple of friends become increasingly controversial!

SO, now for my moment of controversy!

I'm Jesus. And you all are just pee-on disciples! 

I was left out of the 22(+?) comment melee for a reason: because some things just need to be dismissed immediately. And I am one of those things apparently! >:o

I'm going to see GUSTER soon! Thank God for Joe's Mom!!! Tentatively, we will be seeing Say Hi To Your Mom and The Decemberist's as well:D

It's almost Ashley's Birthday! We are more in love than ever, thank friggin jesus."

It's the shit, but I would like some friends!

Summer has been such a mess. A fun disapointing mess. I wish I had the chance to see some of my friends a WHOLE lot more( namely ASHLEY,Joe, Sonja, Sarah, Mike, Mike,ERIC, Dani,RYAN BLANCHETTE because he was my best friend ONCE, Michelle, Emma,Stephie and a couple of others)  and I wish I had the chance to see some people a whole lot less, such as my Dad and my managers. I have about 3% of the grammar done. Basically I'm on the verge of having a stroke. It's not due in 6 days or anything. Jesus Goddamn Christ.

LAST NIGHT Charlene, Michelle, and I started a musical in Portsmouth. It was baaalllsss :]

Pennsylvania, the Humidity State, is a miserable place to be. Especially with your estranged family. Luckily my brothers, aunts, and cousins are understanding and sweet. I miss Ian so much, it was terrible to be close to him and not see him.

Joe said that a little girl named GLYNNIS went on one of his rides at Yorks Wild Kingdom, and then she had to go shit or something. BUT this is good news, THREE of us exist! At least!

I'm having a slumberparty with ASHLEYDOUKAS on Tuesday weeeee :]

If you are looking forward to August 7th-13th, I don't want to talk to you anymore.

UMM if anyone wants to go see Rocky Horror Let me or Charlene KNOW it will be reeeeeaally  fun!

But in all seriousness, Laguna Beach is on and I want to watch it. This is what I have become."

Allan made a giant ramp outside for no reason.

Yesterday my Mom brought lunch to Staples for me and Michelle. My lunch was gross ham salad and peanuts.
Michelle's was tuna fish (my favorite) and oatmeal cookies. But Emily came and visited with me which was nice.

Although, I've been told Britney Spears lives on the very same lake..Maybe I'll see her nekked or something. Take that bitches!</P>
<P>Today I bought the english books, and Breakfast of Champions, another beautiful book by Kurt Vonnegut</P>
<P>That's all. <STRONG>I'll be gone for one week, I expect a minimum of 10 comments.</STRONG></P>"

<P>Last night Shelly came over and we ate too much and watched the Missing which was mildly entertaining. (word to the wise, Navajos are bastards)</P>
<P>Today Shell and I hung out then she left, and I went on a dinner date with my mom to Viola V's. My mom is losing her voice, but it comes back in random uncontrollable spurts. So at one point, she leaned over to me and yelled, ""Hey that man behind you is gorgeous"" then we had to leave because we were laughing wicked hard and everyone was staring.</P>
<P>I'm in the weirdest mood ever. I feel like someone or something big is coming. I keep running over to my windows to see if anything is there. I'm an impatient asshole, and I smell like cigarettes.</P>

<P>Ian came into the house with all of his friends and told me I needed to get some sun. Then I accidentally kicked my cat into a wall. </P>
<P>But then, Mikey, Mike, and Joe came and picked me up and we drove to Laconia. I wouldn't recommend going there because everything closes at 8. We saw a birthdy party through a window with a male stripper.:p</P>
<P>Then Mike stole a handi-capped sign and put it in Mikey's car and it came very close to taking my head off. I have pictures but I'm wicked tired, so maybe tomorrow.</P>

"event","<P>Today was really fun. <STRONG>I got a JOB at Staples</STRONG>. I'm the newest cashier thanks. </P>
<P>Then Ryan came by and we went to go see the show at the commons. I don't really remember anything about it, other than finding it hysterically funny that one of the sound guys looked exactly like Paulie Shore.Then we went to Taco Bell with char and Mike, and went to the Music Hall to see Dogville.</P>
<P>WEIRDEST FUCKING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!</P>
<P>Basically, Nicole Kidman escapes from her mob-boss father aand runs away to this small town in the Rocky Mountains, Dogville. In order to stay, she has to help all 15 members of the town with things they really don't need to do. She does what they ask, as to not be turned back in to the mob. However, soon every man in town, except for her boyfriend, Thomas Edison, decides to rape her..ALL OF THEM, even Tom's father. Then, when she tries to escape, the man who was supposed to take her away rapes her, and brings her back. (Is it really rape if she just sits there?) Eventually, the townspeople declare that she is a menace, and pot her in a collar, complete with a little bell, and tie her to a huge wagon wheel so she can't escape. HOWEVER, Nicole's mob boss father soon comes to the rescue, and tells her that she is the most arrogant person he knows, because she is forgiving of others, and she gets angry, and has <STRONG>the entire town murdered.</STRONG> She shoots Thomas Edison on her own.The only creature she spares is a rabid dog.</P>
<P>So..basically, what I got from the movie, is that rape is okay ONLY during apple picking season. Also I wonder- is anyone really good?</P>
<P>I have to get up really early.</P>
<P>Have fun Sarah I miss you already!</P>"

<P>Just thought I'd clear that up. Ian thinks so anyway. He ate all of my Cracker jacks, and then threw me on the ground. So I threw a pillow in his face, and I am the asshole. I could have said, ""Hey you 22 year old Home Depot employee who has recieved two DWI's and can't drive until he's fucking 35..HOW ABOUT YOU BUY YOUR OWN FUCKING CRACKER JACKS!"" But no way, I just threw a pillow. I'm a nice fucking asshole. </P>
<P>This week has been one huge blur of fucking band. Nope, I didn't partake in the group photo, yet again, I'm an asshole. Instead I listened to that weird girl Jess talk about her ""baby"" (a truck?) and how she totaled it, while heaving bags of nauseating candles into the band room. In the meantime I felt sick and was hoping that I could vomit and get out of carrying candles, but no such luck. And tomorrow is more band. Mm, luckily, some of my best friends are in there&lt;3 </P>

(i guess just because it was glowing in the dark?) we left and drove around and eventually went to walmart and had a crazy time. it was insane. i love walmart at night. the nastiest people hang out there for some undisclosed reason. i love it though. mike was being very cuddly. it made me feel like melting. hes such a sweet kid. bretts ridiculously nice too. and charlene- well we all know that im madly in love with her. she was being all hyper and cute around brett. it made me feel warm inside, giggly too. eventually we ended up a friendly's and met some friends of the boys. all they told us about this one boy was that he had a ridiculously small penis and girls were always making comments like, <EM>""is there anymore?"",</EM> or, <EM>""is it in yet?"".</EM> which is disgusting. so that particular boy started talking to us and charlene and i were both focusing on his crotch. it was so horrible. we wanted to throw up. then we left and dropped mike and brett off back at bretts car. charlene and brett were dancing around the parking lot, which was adorable. and i anal raped mike with a bottle&lt;3 so now im back pouring my heart out to a hypothetical audience. odd.</P>
<P><STRONG>things that really pissed me off today-</STRONG></P>
<P>-i locked charlene out of her car...im such an asshole.</P>
<P>-mike left a nice complaint on my away message about how i told mike fraser about mike's general dislike for him. honestly, im sorry for the upset, but i dont really care. mike- you were being a prejudiced bastard and saying horrible things, which i know you didnt mean, but still. if youre someones real friend you dont just betray them in slight moments of discontent. i love you man, but get over yourself.</P>
<P>-charlenes friend made a slight ""arrangement"" in which mike was not to ""do stuff"" with me (hm, that makes me sound like a hormone charged skank. sweet) i was so mad. this whole stupid petty situation is bringing me down. i dont think i had to deal with girls this caddy and immature since elementary.</P>

And then Ian said that the girls sitting across from us were checking him out, so&nbsp;I turned around and one of the girls was blind, like clearly blind, and was reading a brail pamphlet.</P>
<P>I don't think I will ever laugh that hard again. But I hope I do.</P>"

<P><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=2>i think i discovered, yes, discovered, the meaning of life. and, it is simply to reproduce. yes, you heard me. i stated it at the breakfast table this morning and allan said',""well then why arent there animal &nbsp;faggots?"" i should have spit in his face or something, but i decided to be an adult. i said,""well animals do it mechanically, people take more pleasure in it. therefore, they think of it as more of a pastime, while animals do it to survive"" then i went into excrutiating detail about gay sex. it was glorious.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=2>so you know what to do now. find a mildly attractive member of the opposite sex, or the same sex if you please, and make baaaaaabies! NOW</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=2>im ignoring joe and i feel guilty. peace and hurrgrease.</FONT></P>"

"event","so this morning sean had his basketball game, the big one. he lost and i took way too many pictures, mainly of his back. then i tried to play basketball for the first time since..oh last season. gaaaawd it was horrible. ians friend bounced a ball off of my face.

then colin and joe came over, and i was grouchy with them because i was mad at colin for not wanting to go with me to the show </3 but whatev, im a baby.
then came gridiron, home of talentless metal bands. with the exception of my letter and a few others. some kid scooped half of my ass up in his hand..it was gross. i just kind of looked at him, and he said:""heh heh..heeey."" and then i vomited on his disgusting korn loving face. everyone around me was kissing. i got jealous.  so the next mildly attractive male i see is going to be impaled by my tongue. and thats a threat not a promise. some kid punched me in the lip. i guess he didnt mean to, but i went up to yell at him because he hit charlene too. 
me-""hey..you punched me in the lip..""
him-""oh..sorry? no not really."" (it sounded flirtatious)
me-""....FUCKFACE!!!""
and then i ran away. non confrontational my iz-assss

peace out luvahs"

"event","<P><FONT size=2>give me your thoughts. is there any point to falling in love when youre 15? sometimes it cant be helped, but usually it can. its futile isnt it?&nbsp; its inevitable that someone will get bored, someone will leave, someone will make a mistake, and hearts will get broken. i speak as if i have experience, which i dont. but i suppose the best way to keep your heart in tact is to never risk damage in the first place. </FONT></P>

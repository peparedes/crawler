christmas sucks now.  it's not like how it used to be.

every year, we would celebrate at our house with my mom's side of the family on christmas eve.  then the next day, we would celebrate with my dad's family at my uncle's house in SF.
we haven't done that in 3 years.  we haven't had a tree in 3 years.
and this is just so hypocritical and spoiled of me to say something like this, but it seriously upsets me for some reason.
2 years ago, we went to china for the holidays.  i remember christmas being completely untraditional, or unorthodox even.  maybe not in the negative sense, but different anyways.
we were in hong kong that day, spending the night with my uncle and aunt.  it was a very hot day, so we went to the beach and explored the markets.  then we went shopping downtown, and afterwards had dinner at this hotel restaurant with a band playing.
it was a lot of fun actually, but i remember coming back and thinking, ""great trip, but i can't wait until next year when we get to spend christmas with our family back in california.""

a year later, we did get to go to my aunt's house for christmas.  it was actually more like the week before.  the thing with my dad's family is that they're all cooks.  fabulous cooks.  they have a family-owned restaurant, and my cousin is a pastry chef at the marriot.  i always looked forward to their cooking.  but when we got to their house, all they had were 4 giant platters of chinese take-out they ordered.

my mom's entire family just left.  they all decided to go back to china for the holidays or visit the snow for a few days.  and so on chistmas eve, we did nothing.  the next day, we just had dinner.  once again, no tree.
the christmas tree is very trivial, and i'm surprised at how upset i am about it.  but we always used to decorate it with so many ornaments, and put up the stockings, the wreath on the front door, gather all the presents to put under the tree.  now, our ornaments and decorations have been locked up in the closet for years, i stained the stockings, the wreath is broken, and there are hardly any presents to under a tree that also doesn't exist in this household.
actually, i don't really care about whether or not i get presents.  when i was younger, that was probably all i cared about.  but looking back on it, i could really care less.  i would surely have chosen to spend the night with family rather than have recieved gifts.

i don't know. we haven't done this in so long, and i really just miss it....



damn, i'm so spoiled.  there are people out there with barely enough food to put in their mouths, and here i am crying over some stupid holiday.



HAPPY HOLIDAYS."

"event","i swear, a couple days ago, my driveway was flooding and schools were shut down because it was raining so hard.

and today was perfect.  despite the chilly temperatures, there was not a cloud in the sky.  watch tommorow be the start of another brief spout of el nino.

anyway, i'm on winter break now.  it's going pretty well i guess.
i saw my friend's performance of the nutcracker at holy names college today.
i had fun.  no actually, i did.  and i'm not being sarcastic.
she brought me backstage to watch them rehearse, and to eat the tub of chocolate that her fellow dancers brought.
plus, the costumes were beautiful.  i assumed they would be tacky and amateur, but they turned out great.

also, i'm going to tahoe on christmas.  or is it reno?
i'll be snowboarding, which i have been looking forward to since last spring break.
but i get to spend the entire christmas day in the mini-van."

"event","i LOVE drea.  she did all this stuff for me, and it's so much cooler than anything i would have done.  thank you so much.

i was touring around my profile and whatnot, and for some reason i have 20 friends on there.  i think drea added them.  that was sweet of her.
the only problem is that i don't know who they are.
but i recall her telling me they were the EBAS show girls.

this sucks, because i haven't seen the EBAS live since april. and i used to see them once a month, which isn't a lot, but it's a lot more than what i've been doing now.
i have no excuse to not be checking out good music."

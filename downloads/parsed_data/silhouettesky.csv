"event","Hmm. 
Life is suddenly purposeful.
I am stressed but very happy.
I am drowning but welcoming the change.

There are things that I previously dismissed without hesitation that have come into question. There are moments that just feel like a puzzle piece has been put into place in my life and the void is that much smaller. I guess that what gets me through these rough circumstances is feeling like I'm doing exactly what I should be doing."

One of the closest friends I've had in years.
He and I really are the same.

I made pizza and teriyaki chicken kabobs with garlic bread and icecream tiramisu that turned out very well.
I love being a hostess.

Poor bunny has to work the rest of the weekend. 
San Leandro on Sunday and then I say my goodbyes to Tracy next weekend.

<i>It feels good to write again. Pen in hand I am a stream of thought; giving all that I have to the paper. All that I am is here in harsh black scribbles against the clean white paper. I think I can turn a blind eye to my evils now and never look back. A life of regrets isn't worth living. I've seen some of the worst and made it out if only to say that I'm not afraid anymore.</i>

I don't know. I guess I felt like posting it."

I'm applying for graduation, not like its anything worth the fuss that my parents are making. Of course they make a big deal out of everything. This time next year I'll be in grad school hopefully (meaning even it costs me an arm and a leg to get there).

School soon and I will be broke again. I still want to get away; this summer only fueled my destructive tendencies. I have to fight the urge to pack a few things and disappear. I guess that Aaron is the only thing keeping me here. 

I'm glad he's not as crazy as I am.

"event","Why is it still raining? I thought that it was supposed to be April showers and May flowers. 

Moving is such a pain in the neck. There was a three to four hour window yesterday that we tried to move everything that we could before Aaron went to work. This resulted in: almost everything for the kitchen, dining room table and chairs, tv with dvd player and gamecube, the vacuum cleaner, some of my books, and an air mattress. It was a sad house-warming with no where for anyone to really sit. Still it was nice and almost all of my girls made it over to see the place. I heard it said that ""this is college life, sitting on an air mattress in the living room and talking about how broke we all are."" 

Broke... don't even get me started on broke. I'm afraid to set up the phone and internet because of the money it's going to cost. I wish that I could start work before June. *sigh* And now there is a term paper waiting to be written."

It's raining today. The best thing about spring rains is how they barge into the middle of the week and force all the Barbies to gain some common sense and cover up for once. Today feels more colorful than usual also; sure the ground and sky meld together in gray but, everywhere I look, the place is spotted with bright umbrellas and shiny raincoats. 

Ahhh, there is still so much packing to be done."

Not much to share about today. I watched a horrible video about fishing that makes me happy that I've never eaten seafood. There were graphic scenes showing men jabbing a large fish to get it inside the boat and blood was everywhere. It was incredibly sad. =( Setting that aside, today was not significant in any way; maybe tomorrow will be better or today, as it would seem."

"event","Groping in the dull light of a distant tv set, I jotted down lines from a french film by Chris Marker titled <b>La Jetee</b> that seemed of importance in the moment. I didn't worry about missing subtitles while I was writing; I know enough french to rough it. 

<i>memories are only made memorable by the scars they leave.</i>

<i>to awaken again in another time, fully grown.</i>

<i>on the tenth day, images begin to appear like confessions.</i>

Nearly twenty-four hours later I still have the shots of the man with his eye bandage and electrodes; I can still hear the breathy whispers that couldn't be translated and the heavy marching that set the tempo for my own heartbeat. Even now it seems odd to me that our time-traveler-guinea-pig is so captivated with the images that he doesn't pause for even a moment to notice that they are his own memories. I still have questions: How could he lose his mothers face in time? Why did Marker settle on the hard frame, black and white, progression of still shots under narrative? Is it supposed to leave me with the impression that society is too ingrained for the world to end?

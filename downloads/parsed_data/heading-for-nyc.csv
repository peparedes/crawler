"event","I haven't posted in awhile because I didn't want my journal to become a bitching forum. Well, the bitch is back. The worst day ever = today. Aside from fighting with my mom and car troubles...I can't seem to figure out why I'm so easily written off. So, tonight, I was blown off only to catch that in the act, big surprise there and then COMPLETELY blown off for tall, skinny, pale and unattractive. Oh, what a night, it just keeps getting better and better. Every fucking time I think I could maybe find happiness in just a relationship with someone, it just completely goes fucking south. A wave hello, a nod goodbye. That's all I got from you, so thanks for the dagger in the gut. It just kills me sometimes that I apparently am devoid of any desirable feature in any aspect of my life. I'm not one to just hook up for no reason...I like to think that potential is there. Cue the pulling of the rug. I feel so helpless. I feel like I'm spinning out of control. I can't take control of anything and I don't know what it is that keeps me from achieving anything of worth. Oh, wait, I do. I'm a fucking failure. A social experiment gone completely awry. I used to be happy. What happened?"

"event","It's been awhile. I guess I haven't had much to say. So...Two jobs this summer. One for a day, the other: 2 months. Now, I wish maybe I'd stayed at the cafe, but something tells me that's just me being stupid. I got a call from AE today after two months saying, ""We have your application here, do you want to come in for a group interview?"" Well, now I'm going in for that next monday. Let's hope I get that job because I need one real quick. I dunno...my life is just real boring right now. I don't know really what to do with myself. I mean, I'm gonna start classes soon and that's good, but everyone will be gone, except me the kid that fucked up at big boy school and has to stay at home. I hate it. Why couldn't I just have settled down and done right? Hopefully, I can get my mom to let me go somewhere second sememster, if she doesn't, I'll have to move out because, I cannot live here for the entire year. Don't get me wrong, I like living here and it's pretty cool most of the time, but my siblings get on my last goddamn nerve. My mom sometimes can get real hellacious on me and I can't stand her. All I know is I can't stay here. Why can't I do anything right?"

"event","I am so fucking sick of work. Yesterday I got a talk from my store manager because I'm acting ""different."" Sorry. I'm fucking tired. She knew about my show and that during tech week I would be going 9 til 11 with no breaks in between and apparently, she doesn't realize how much energy a show takes, especially a musical with 5 performances in 4 nights, I was pretty much exhausted. Oh, well. I fucking hate my job. I need to get another one. Real quick. It's like this. That job means nothing to me but a paycheck. Heaven forbid I'm stuck in a retail job for the rest of my life. So, basically this week has sucked with the exception of Saturday night when Brenden, Adam and I went to Adam's friend Alex's house. That was good times. So, I go back to work today at 5...I wanna find a job by friday so I can quit immediately. Anyway, my mom leaves this friday...so, I'll have the casa to myself which hopefully means some drunk shenanigans. Ah, well. Talk to you all later."

"event","Lately, I've just been blah, and annoyed, moody, and just generaly hating everyone. I mean, I just try so happy, you know, but it never seems to work. Certain people annoy me because if circumtances were different, I would so be in love with them, and they just tease and tease and tease. I hate it. Though, I love them. so, that gets on my nerves. On the other hand, everyone else always seems to be able to get what they want, but I always get shafted. It's like, if I ever want something, it gets pulled out from under me in just enough time to make sure it hurts. It sucks, because I'll think someone likes me or that maybe there's a chance, but it generally is a total misconception on my part or they are talking to me to get to someone I know. Well, shitty. I try not to feel shitty. I try to be happy. I mean, I certainly don't like me this way, so I can't imagine anyone else wants to deal with me either. I don't know. I always hear, ""When you're not looking for it, it'll happen."" Ok, tried that bullshit. To no avail, of course. I tried looking cute on a daily basis and really caring about my appearance. Nothing. I tried not caring completely. Nothing. I tried to not be the perpetual nice guy. Nothing. Apparently, nothing short of brain washing is going to help me. I guess I'm just not that boy."

"event","OK, this past weekend was crazy. Crazy, crazy, crazy. I was so drunk all the time. I could not tell you how I am alive at this very moment. Well, I can, but it's just more dramatic if I don't. So, ANYWAY, Friday. Went to Stacey's. Played Asshole and Circle of Death. Drunk as shit. Saturday. Beer and Porn at my house. Again, Drunk as shit. Then Fourth of July, I didn't think it was possible to be drunk and have a hangover in the same day...but it is. See, I went to Adam's for his family's barbecue and one of the first things I hear is, ""Casey! Wanna beer?"" A confused look ensues, followed by, ""Sure ya do!"" OH, yes...I was pretty gone by about 5 in the afternoon, not that I beat Mama, herself...she was drunk by 1. Props to Mama. After the ""Ocean Water Margarita"" and the ""50/50 Cosmo"" I was done only to sober up at Adama's house. It caused me and Adam to retreat to his room to lounge and watch Independence Day. Twas fun. Then Sabrina and Melissa came over. We drank some Box o' Wine. Well, They did. I did not. They were so drunk. haha. They puked, which, in retrospect, isn't surprising. Anyway, all that this weekend was, was drunk.

Onto Monday, where, again, I was drunk. Oh, wow. ANYWAY, I remember Katie and I sitting on the carpet in her hallway singing ""A Whole New World."" Ha. Good times.
Today, however I had to go to D.C. for this STUPID orientation seminar for H&M. I was not a happy boy. ESPECIALLY because it cost me like 8 bucks to go from Vienna to F Street and back again. And once I got there, we had to sit through this...ungodly boring lecture about different shit about H&M. Sorry, but this is not my career. You don't pay me enough to care. On a happier note, I had IHOP tonight and I am feeling QUITE content. I think I am going to sleep now because, I don't have to work tomorrow and I want to sleep for as long as humanly possible before my mom wakes me up, which I know she will."

"event","OK, perhaps my last post was a bit cryptic and harsh. I can do something about the cryptic, but not the harsh reality of my fucking life.

So, around me everywhere I see love, heartbreak, longing and desire. I want that. I want to be needed. I want to be loved. I want to mean something to someone. I'm sorry that I don't have what it takes to just be instantly recognized. I'm sorry you have to get to know me before you can care about me, but by that point, we're ""just friends."" I'm so fucking sorry that I just don't make the cut. I wish I was just drop dead gorgeous. I wish I was built like a greek god. I am none of those things. I Never probably will be any of those things. I am just your average, ordinary, run-of-the-mill ""I love you like a brother"" reject. That is my life. That is my reality.

"event","Alright. The night was spent with katie and Brenden at IHOP. Yes, NOT the Diner. Anyway, I drank alot of coffee and really this post is made mostly out of boredness and an inability to sleep right now. So, IHOP was lotsa fun. Of, course, with my hot friends why wouldn't it be. So, I'm kinda annoyed with some people right now. Get a grip. Enough about that. So, anyway, last night. I had a vicious nightmare about v. Nasty, juicy v, no less. I don't remember much, but I do remember it was just a big v and it was certainly the variety with dirty beef curtains. I know that this all stems from looking at female genitali piercings at Katie's. It was so gross. There was one that, according to Katie looked like ""the abyss"" and one that offended both Stacey and Katie's v. Also, I gave a quick tutorial on an unmentionable topic, so I'm not sure why I brought it up, but I guess I can read this later and laugh. Anyway, as I said I'm quite fidgety and tweaked out. But I guess alot of coffee will do that, huh? Also, I want to give a shout out to my gir' Erin. 


HAPPY BIRTHDAY! WOO!


That said, I'm gonna go find something to do, because I won't be sleeping anytime soon."

"event","OK. Saved! was absolutely fabulous. I had some reservations about Mandy Moore, but I was pleased with her. Oh, Hilary Faye. The whole story line was great. The comedy played a minor role to the story which will probably make you cry a little. I mean, I could go on forever about it, but I just need to say a few things. The message was great. Jena Malone's character, ""Mary,"" says it best, ""If God made us all so different, why would he want us all the be the same?"" It was so good. I thought it was going to be pure sacrilege, however, it really wasn't. Well, maybe when Mandy Moore crashes her van into Jesus, but that's just comic genius. It just points out flaws of the people who can't except anything other than what the bible tells them. ""Hey, Mary come to the prayer circle tonight. We're praying for Dean's faggotry."" While it is quite amusing, how horrible is it that people feel that one needs to be prayed for because of who they are? I don't know, but this movie is the summer season's ""It Girl,"" to be sure. See it, it is well worth whatever you pay for it."

And there we have one of the BEST quotes ever. So, I had Amanda's Grad Party today. It was acually pretty fun and it was so good to see everyone again. Ma and Pa, Robin, Brabdon, Ashley and Kyle Trott! I had not seen Kyle in ages. WAY pleased with that. Then after that I went home and Erin invited yours truly to come to a bonfire with her. So, that whol drive in itself was D-R-A-M-A. Ok, so first off I (stupidly) drive twenty minutes past the road I was supposed to turn on before even thinkin, ""Hey, maybe I missed the turn."" Well, ANYWAY, I finally make my way down Gunston, onto Belmont and looking for Madison. Looking for Madison. STILL looking for Madison. fast forward. Looking for Madison. FINALLY I call Erin on her cell from a payphone. Apparently, the directions suck. There's a street BEFORE Madison. Oh, yes. That would be Dolly Street. ""Who knew that was key?""

Well, I finally get there and we started to do a lil smoking. Good times had by all, to say the least. Well, I think I had the MOST assinine converstaions ever tonight. Erin and I babbled for 20 minutes about Nancy Reagan's composure during the funeral. We babbled on topics ranging from ticks to the Tony's to ""situations."" Oh, good times. Well, when finally dip out it is DECIDED that we most definitely need to stop at Wendy's and straight grub. Oh, we indulged. 2 junior bacons and a coke later, I was feeling rather full. (Who knew?) Anyway, it was time to indulge some more. Yes sir, bring on the chain smoking, we said. OH! I TOTALLY FORGOT. In the epitome of ""Stoner Moments"" we hold this in the archive. As were getting the food from the drive-thru I had to wait for Erin to drive away so I could drive up and get ""the best dollar ever spent."" Well, when Erin drove away, I did too. I drove away without getting my paid for food. That was more than ridculous. I held composure until I had to face Erin and Brian. Then I lost it. Giggles happened for a good 2-3 minutes. We the laughter subsided, Erin was seen to be finishing 2 junior bacons and a thing of chicken nuggets. We lunched on her for 5 minutes before she said,""If you're gonna go swimming, you have to get wet."" I think I almost peed my pants.

So basically, this night has been one big hootnanny."

"event","So, I started my new job at H&M today. BTW, I actually know what that satnds for now. lol. Hennes and Mauritz, for those interested. So, it was pretty good. I really like everyone I work with. I found out today that only three people of the seven that interview got jobs, so I felt WAY special. Another thing that made me feel WAY special is that we have walkie-talkies, OOH! I spent a about an hour learning company policy and things liek that and then, without much training at all, actually, none, I was thrust onto the floor. It was pretty neat. All I really di was run clothes, but during that period, so MANY strange things happened. For instance, Cara found a single Prada shoe in the dressing room. One that had been worn in, presumably. It was very odd. Sond weird thing, a VERY southern and VERY gay boy came in today with his friends and as I was in the dressing room cleaning up, he was all looking at me and such and at one point started, I guess, flaunting his body. He was attractive so, I tolerated him, but he was a trip. He started to try on some clothes from the store and, keep in mind, it's a women's clothing only store and my manager, Cara, looks at me and goes, ""Oh, wow. WHAT a queen."" Oh, Cara. So, that was my day at work. I like it there and at the end of the day, I didn't smell like food. A DEFINITE plus. So, that's all for now. BYE!"

"event","So, I went in to work today. It was okay, I guess. I got trained which is easy, but really fucking blows. I had already worked in a restaurant, just not a full service restaurant so most of what Susan, a manager/waitress, told me was irrelevant because, well, I already knew it. I mean, I knew more about working in a restaurant than this kid who was a week ahead of me knew. Oh, well. I'll stick it out...I think. However, as I worked I got a call from H&M, the job I really wanted, because they want to hire me. So, I'm a bit freaking out because, I want to work at H&M...but I already have the waiter job and I could make lots of money but that's not certain, whereas at H&M, I know that for every hour I work I get $7-8. Like today, while training, I made I think like 10 bucks for 5 hours...ugh, that sucks ass. I just don't know what to do. I like all the people (well, that I met) at City Square and I know Adam will be there, but I just don't know what to do. I hate touching otuer people's food, too. So, that's a problem, yes? Yes. Oh, I'm so indecisive!! Well, I'll have to figure that out by tomorrow. It all depends on how much H&M is gonna pay me. Tomorrow all will be over and done with, it's just getting there that's hard."

I don't think I'm goign back, though. I know there will be many of you very upset with me. Shenandoah isn't the place for me. It's so political and I understand that all theatre is but, Mr. Herman never thought to think of any freshman, unless, of course you were some sort of phenom, so, bump that. I'm spending a semester at NOVA, only because my mom is making me, but eventually transferring to a ""real"" college, probably CNU. (YAY MELISSA!)I dunno. I'm happy to be home, I guess.

I'm in college and evryone's telling me to not get into a relationship, but if college is for new experiences, then I should try to find a relationship. I've never been in one and how am I gonna ever find anyone if by the time I get out of here I've never had a significant other? I'll be completely clueless about that sort of thing and just end up saboyaging all of my relationships. I thought that at college, where I can be who I am, something would stick out and someone would want to be with me, but it seems that High School is replaying itself in my college life. I just feel like crying sometimes. *sigh*"

There have been the highlights but generally speaking, this week sucked. There is a bud shortage. Parties are being called off left and right. Certain people in my life are causing drama. It just is such a pain in the ass to live sometimes. The certain people are really confusing me. Sometimes it's one way and other times it's another. I mean, let's just be real here, you either want it or you don't. Make up your mind for my sake. Oh, yet another tragic moment. The Polish Triplets from school were on Montel. OK, I'm not gonna front. They straight up suck. They play violin alright, I guess. However, singing is not their forte. I found out something else, too. Adam's school(UArts) is doing Lippa's The Wild Party. Some of you not knowing musical theatre won't care, but those of you that know it know how depressing it is to see that some of your friends went to schools where they get to do cool musicals, but at good ol' Shenandoo-doo, we do The Pajama Game and other shitty musicals.

So, I think I might have left it on the car as I was pumping and then drove away with it still on the car. However, i also think it might have been left in the store when I was paying and if that be the case, well then, that's fab, because...it's still there then and I just have to go pick it up. I honestly don't think I left it on the car because, I had to put the gas cap on and it would have been in the same place and I would have seen it. Therefore, I am almost positive that I left it in the store. Oh, I do hope so. I cannot have lost two cell phones in such rapid succession."

We got up there in good time and we went to Adam's show, which was better this week, I think. Well, anyway, we had Adam's friend John, pick up 4 40's of Steel Reserve, 2 for each. mmm, delightful. So, anyway, I get through about 3/4 of mine and Melissa finishes all of her along with taking a shot of tequila. She was gone. The party we were at was promptly broken up by the cops. On our way out, Melissa slipped in her drunkeness and fell down a flight of stairs. Of course, she took me with her. After some more wandering, we got back to Adam's room where Lissy promptly passed out, face first into her pillow. Today we left Philly for home, but this time it took us considerably longer to get back, but we cared not. Ok, y'all, memorable quotes of the trip.

*Melissa falls down flight of stairs in front of a cop*
Melissa: Oh, these damn cheap Forever 21 boots.

Casey: Did you just run into that wall?
Adam: NO! I found it.

*loud crash*
Adam: What was that?
Casey: I don't know. At least it wasn't one of us.
*bathroom door opens, Melissa emerges, shrugging shulders*
Melissa: I don't know. It just fell. 

Melissa: Oh, I am so sorry. *ten seconds* Ben, you are so nice. *ten seconds* I am sooo sorry. *ten seconds* You are so nice, Ben. *ten seconds* I am really so sorry. *ten seconds* You are really so nice, Ben. *ten seconds* You have nice hair.

On-stage: Did you do something wicked?
Casey & Melissa, in unison: For the first time...

Melissa: Well, to be honest, I do.

Casey: That's not true! Sometimes, I like concentration camps.

*Casey and Melissa singing Wicked*
Melissa: You're perfect.
Casey: You're perfect.
Casey & Melissa: So, we're perfect together!
Melissa: Oh, that is SO us.


I had a GREAT weekend! I hope everyone else did well, too!"

"event","I am so proud of myself. 

I started going to the gym. I quit smoking. Well, for the most part, but it's a start. I have not bought a pack of cigs in like 2 weeks, at least. So, this workout thing, I hope, will make me feel and look better as well as boost myself self-esteem, because although I'll never be skinny, I'll look better. Really, as long as I can gain some muscles and lose just a little weight, I think I'll look really hot. I wanna work on my stomach because that's definitely my problem area. I want to lose some weight in my face as well. I'm working on my ass and arms as well. In my opinion, big, strong arms are so hot. Hopefully, others will think so, too. 

I'm proud of myself not in the fact that I'm bettering myself, but that I'm doing something to help myself. My self-esteem has not always been the greatest and just in the past week, I've felt so much better about myself. I feel like I can do anything and I don't feel ugly or fat. I just am happy. Must be the endorphin high, which, btw, is fabulous."

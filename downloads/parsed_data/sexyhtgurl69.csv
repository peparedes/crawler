"event","well....working full time, it's ok i guess. shows a little in the paycheck. but getting up every morning at 630 it not fun at all...i have to put myself to bed at like 1030 at the latest to get up in time...

and then going to night school, well thats not all that bad i guess..better then getting up in the morning to go to school....my classes arent all that bad, just a overexaggerating, all into herself kinda teacher...and one that is a very sexual, crazy old man....that wears striped sweaters and ties over them...its bizare to say the least.

i guess you could say i am single right now...in the external sense...meaning we arent together for the public....but when it's just us it's the same, just not as good.  well it's good that hes got a job now monday thru friday, its good that we are still talking..but bad that we arent together and i talk to him like once a week and see him like once a week now....well who knows...i gotta get out and meet some guys, but i dont know any guys???...erg help!

not doing much else but hanging with marc and laurel like every day...just chillin..the usual..

trying to get a car...i am going to the auction saturday to look at what they have. hope i see something i like no too expensive...yes thats right, the untima is dead. at least i think...or in other words i am not paying anymore money for the f-ing thing to get fixed...

supossed to pay nikki's dad when i get my check for my meap...but once again its not coming...until god f-ing knows when...ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!! i hate school for that reason...well its not really the school..its the f-ing goverment..its their money i am getting mother f-ers! but i got a 250 in the mail...ok thats great but wheres the other 600??? thanks...

well guess thats really it....what in interesting entry LoL

"event","this holiday was okay i guess...lots of turkey and stuffing so thats always good...

me and q decided, i guess you could put it, after we got in another big fight, to call it quits for awhile..at first i couldnt have been happier because i am just sick of alot of shit that i do not need nor want to go in details about...and i just talked to him for the first time since thursday night and he called to tell me he is getting ready to get on the bus to go out of town...he doesnt know for how long he said maybe a couple days...maybe weeks...but he will call me when he gets back.

i'm no waiting, i am done and thats al i have to say....

but how can you just be done with someone that you know you are in love with but it's so hard to be with that one person. i love him and i will always love him. i'm not just saying that. he was different then any other guy i dated. i saw him every day. i changed practically my whole life for him. i wanted to be with him forever. but it just got to be to much. but how do i just let go...i've been crying ever since he told me he was leaving...like we have gone thru this so many times and i dont want to deal with it anymore...but at the same time i cant just let him go. i cant just push him out of my life because that man is my life, and thats what is going to take some getting used to.

on a happier note....i have been hanging out with a guy that i really like and that is what made me know that i needed a break from Q. no i'm not a hoe. we are just hanging out and what not right now...according to him we are not dating...but it's good nonetheless. i have spent every minute with him since friday night, and it is the first time i have been really happy in awhile...he makes me want to be a better person...

but how can i just push away everything i have known, spent time on, put effort into, and someone that i am in love with for someone that i think MAY have feelings back...i know i can do better...but do i want to look for better when i know that the next person i will be with won't be him and i don't think i will be able to get that thru my head...let alone my heart"

I swear
By the moon and the stars in the skies
And I swear
Like the shadow that's by your side

I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure
I know my part

'Cause I stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes
I'll never break your heart

With every beat of my heart

And I swear
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I'll give you everything I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories
On the walls

And when (And when) just the two of us are there
You won't have to ask if I still care
'Cause as the time turns the page
My love won't age at all

And I swear (And I swear)
By the moon and the stars in the skies
I'll be there (I'll be there)
I swear (And I swear)
Like the shadow that's by your side

Q and i are back together after some bigs fights....but fights that needed to happen to get some things across....i dunno what is going on with him....he needs to get a job and get his shit together...i dunno where he is gonna live right now and it's stressing me out.. ahhhhhh!!!

school is going pretty good i guess. i really like most of my classes and my teachers....so i hope i will get to bring my grades up this semester....i am trying to figure out what i want to do next year and i have no idea at this point.

i got a job thru work study at MCC. i tutor little kids...moinday-friday 3:30-6 $10/hr...not too bad....then i got a call from MRs. Mullan and she wants me to help kelly with a scrapbook and get paid for it...i just need to find time to get it in my schedule...but i could definately use the extra cash...

i am doing good at home...so glad to be back for good....looking to save up for a car soon and then move out. but that wont be for awhile...prolly not til after the summer providing i save up and get a good job in the summer! 

i saw vicky this weekend...she is getting a belly!!!!! awwww! i cant wait til she has her baby.....

i've been hanging with tater and kate every day along with jd,al,q,ad, and the rest of the clan...whoever might be there that day!!! it's been pretty fun.....but boring at the same time....i really should concentrate on school more and getting money...but it's hard for me to do that when i am worried about seeing Q for the day...
oh well i gotta get my priorities straight!

my grandma was out of town this weekend! THANK GOD!!! Q got to spend all weekend here! it was soo nice!

well i guess that's it because thss is really long and i gotta go to olive garden to eat! yay!!!!"

Me? I'm scared of everything. Of what I saw, of what I did, of who I am. But most of all, I'm scared of walking out of this room and never feeling the rest of my life, the way I feel when I'm with you.

"event","At some point in your life you will lose someone you love. Sometimes loving that someone means letting go, and love doesn't have to die just because the relationship has died. Sometimes, letting go isn't the end of the world, but the beginning of a new one. Cherish the memories, for they are all that's left...my friend shannan had that in her info....it's the best quote i can even think of right now....so he's leaving today at 2:50 pm to go to texas for training, where he can;t have any visitors....oh well....what the fuck?!?! ahhhhhh"

You're warm, and the most approachable. You have<br>that gentle prescence about you. People can<br>relate to you, and find you easy company.<br>However it's likely you've been hurt in the<br>past and it has left you scarred so things can<br>become rather chilly with you at times. Being<br>the third Season in, you're mature, trustworthy<br>and loyal to your friends but prone to<br>depression and negative thinking.

Well done... You're the shy and sensitive season :)

"event","it just so happens u find out who ur true friends are after they stab u in the back. people warn u about them and u dont listen until finally, something happens so bad u dont even want to look at that person again. that is how i feel.u would think that when someone says no, the person they are saying no to would listen. bullshit! first impressions are very important, but the last impressions u have of somebody before u leave, u will never forget. this something i will never forget. the person that this goes to wil understand. if u dont understand then its not u. and no i will not forgive u. u hurt me to an extent that i never thought would be possible coming from u. i admired u, i trusted u, i loved u. but this is something that i didnt admire and i dont love and i trusted u would never do. its just plain unexceptable."

I've looke d at this empy paper for 45 minutes now not knowing what to say or if you're really want to hear any of it. This could hurt you and make things harder on you or i could piss you off that I'd even dare contacting you or you could throw it away unread beause after all this time you don't give a shit about what I have to say. I don't know which is worse. Hell, I'll probably be too chicken shit to send it off anyway so I guess it doesn't matter.

A year without you and here I am. A miserable food. Fucked in the head and still thinking about you constantly.

It sucks here. hot. crowded, dusty. most guys won't shut up about how much they want to go home. They're scared to be here. I'm more afraid to go home. It's easy to hide here. Here, the only thing that's uncertain is your safety. Back home, everything else is.

The kids here are great. I want to bring like 10 of them back with me. Becky and Issac have been shipping me toys and candy for them. I hardly ever get to see them because of what I do here but when we come by, they love us. It doesn't matter what continent I'm in , I'm still just a big jungle gym.

Fuck it. Amy I miss you . There have been some pretty shitty times around here and I've had a lot of close calls. I have 4 bullet holes in my helmet so far. One of the only reasons I have fought to stay alive when things got really bad was the thought of seeing you someday. That's hard to admit. Because most of the time I just feel like dieing.

I don't think I'll ever really sleep again.

Are you still my beautiful Amy? Would you still smile for me or do you hate me by now? I'm sorry for treating you so shitty. I'm always the biggest asshole to those I care about most.

I hope you're taken care of and protected and happy. Even if you hate me. ""for nothing can be ill if she be well""

I'm sorry
Whatever's left of me is still your's. CEM"

Hopefully I'll be getting my cellphone back soon bcuz that will be my only way of communication. So for now I have no communication until I get myself to a library over there. I'm just letting you ppl know of my absence. No I haven't died, nor have I forgotten anyone I just don't have a way to communicate from over there to over here.

This is the best thing thats happened to me, don't kno how I'll make it financially but I'll find a way. I'm leaving in a week and some days. I will admit I'm still scared of leaving but it's normal to feel this way bcuz one doesn't know what to expect.

(my dress was the color of this font)<br /><br />LOL I did show up late, yes I kno I have a horrible curse in which I must always be late, but it wasn't my fault. Seriously this time it really wasn't. The lady who does my hair had a ""family emergency"" so the lady who works with her had to do our hair, nadia's and mine, and she doesn't know how to do hair styles for shit. So I had to come home and fix the mess she made on my hair so it could look decent. But she used a whole bunch of this, nadia called it,&nbsp;""helmet hair spray"" that took quite a while to fix, I had to fight with my hair. In the end my mom and I fixed it so it could look decent but I didn't love it. I would do just the hair part over if I could. Prom started at 7 pm promptly and we arrived at 8:40 pm LOL. I was only worried we would be the only ones who would walk in while everyone was sitting which would provoke stares. But we weren't the only ones who came late so I got over it. I ate, hurriedly becuz the waiter seemed to be rushing us. I'm still mad about my cheesecake, I couldn't get my cheesecake&nbsp;becuz we had to take pictures so the waiter ppl took that as ""they aren't coming back"" and they didn't serve us cheesecake :'( I love cheesecake!&nbsp;<br /><br />A lot of ppl looked nice. I was surprised becuz it hadn't hit till that night was almost over that this <em>was senior</em> year and we weren't coming back next year. I guess I keep thinking we're coming back next year. Certain boys can clean up nicely ^_~ LOL. And I danced my ass off. I love dancing but I only do it when I'm in family becuz I kinda feel shy. But at prom I let loose, LOL, and Nadia too which is wat surprised me most of all. Boy can nadia dance. Maybe she can be persuaded to go clubbing.....LOL<br /><br />IDK wat else to talk about....</font>"

"event","<p align=""left""><em><font color=""#333399"" size=""3""><br />There was once a girl so infatuated with a boy that she didn't notice he wasn't as perfect as she made him out to be. She held him in a pedastal never making him come down, and he didn't even deserve to be up there. If she only knew the things he did, then he wouldn't be a saint. But she loved him, I mean why else would she be so blinded by his lies? He went around with other girls luring them with his charm and good looks. They all fell for him, every single one did. What type of girl can resist a man with charm? And the poor girl would get her heart broken everytime he played around with another girl, in front of her. She was&nbsp;his girlfriend, how could he be so inconsiderate? You would always see her walking away with tears in her face, while the other girl and her boyfriend kept laughing and flirting. Poor girl, who wouldn't feel bad for her. Never once did he turn back and look for her, he pretended she wasn't there. But all it took was a little talk with her and he would have her smiling again. He used his charm, he didn't have to even try because one smile from him was enough to put them back on good terms. They told her to get rid of the scum she was with. But how could she trust her friends when they were the very people trying to separate him from her because in reality they were jealous. Here she was a young, sweet, and naive girl lured in by a prince charming who knew how to play the game very well. Of course she would fall for his tricks, like little red riding hood. Except that little red riding hood was never blinded by the hood of her coat. He played his cards well. He knew he would never have a girl who could let him get away with all his lies and games so he sticked with her, he wasn't as dumb as the others thought. But didn't he realize he was just playing with the poor girl, he wasn't intrested in her, it was only for his convenience. Had he no heart to just use somone so innocent this way? It made him feel a pang in his heart but as soon as he felt it, that pain left. It was momentary, he had no remorse. And the girl, well she kept letting it slide. She knew what he was doing but she let him because she'd rather be with him than be lonely. But he started to change with her until it got to the point where he didn't care if he hurt her anymore. She could feel the end of the fantasy that was their relationship beginning to end. He wasn't even&nbsp;nice with her anymore. He didn't even smile to cover up his tracks. He let her have the truth coldly. He did treat her like his girlfriend because he atleast recognized her as that. He didn't hold the door open for her anymore, while he checked out the other girls that passed. Didn't hold her hands as they walked, he wanted to walk alone. Stopped trying to make conversation and left her alone when she started to talk. He turned into Mr. Hyde, poor girl. She quickly realized that these were no ordinary troubles. She tried to kiss him once but his lips were cold. It was the type of kss that made her know she wasn't wanted. He no longer looked at her with the sweet smile he always had just for her, because he always felt sympathy for her. She was his sweet little girl she saw it in his eyes. And now there was someone else who had actually become of highest importance to him. She could feel the dread take over her body everyday. He became obsessed with the oher woman; saying her name in his dreams. It could all be over any day. People would laugh saying she was stupid and naive. Others would pity her for getting played. Everyday that he grew colder to her the more she wanted to wrap her arms around him and reach him. He wasn't intrested in her, she couldn't even get his full attention. He was too much of a coward to actually end things with her so he kept being a jerk hoping that she'd break it off. But she never did. She stood her ground and always accepted him no matter what he did. They became perfect strangers. One day he finally revealed to her how sick he was of what they had. He wanted her to be more like the woman he'd met. She was full of life, and fiery, everything she wasnt. She set boundaries for him and made him change his ways. But he was the fool when she revealed her truth. She told him she knew all those times he was unfaithful and she knew it well. She could name every single girl he cheated on her with. She let him get away with it because she believed there was a good person deep inside. She was determined to see what others couldn't and she had. If anything she fooled him because she&nbsp;was her own competition. She turned into everything she wasn't. She changed her look to prove a point. She had been naive and let him get away with many things, but she was the only person who would let that happen because she cared about him where others didn't. It didn't matter to her how charming he was, it was who he was on the inside that mattered. Thats what she saw in him and it hurt that he never wanted her not even for who se was. She was the woman he was obsessed with. She was the woman who had set boundaries and she asked him how it felt to not be loved back.&nbsp;<br /><br /><font color=""#cc99ff""><font size=""2"">Before you start making guesses this isn't about anyone in particular.

So until it gets fixed, which I hope its very soon, I wont be online. I was just getting used to having internet again :( the worst part is that I'm going to lose all my new songs that I downloaded but didn't get a chance to put into my ipod *cries*. But on the plus side I didn't lose all the new avies I collected because I saved them.&nbsp;<br /><br />On other news theres nothing new going on with me. My phone got disconnected so idk when it will be back on.

Well I got my computer fixed. Apparently I damaged it more, blonde moment, but it's okay now. Except for the part where some programs dont work and my ipod *sobs* cant be connected to the computer. Nothing exciting has happened... I mean its my life, come on now, when has something exciting happened?!... I got a new phone this saturday. I was sick on thursday I thought I was going to die, literally. Hmmm..... the most exciting thing that has happened is nadia's little incident that happened on friday which I seem to keep reliving, even tho it didnt happen to me LMAO... <i>*Hint hint*</i> that should tell you something. 

So.....Maybe my computer will make a full recovery by wednesday, I need to call that man. The most exciting thing that will happen is that I will try to get the new version of Microsoft works. Pity, I have no life.

"event","<P>Yes well the other was just an outlet. This is an update. Well I too feel as if summer is passing and I'm just wasting it, again. Every summer I make resolutions for the new school year, yet I never do them. I really wanted to get my goals for this summer done. But there are so many complication Idk why I didn't think of the complications before making my goals. I really do need a job, not only because I need the money to buy myself things I want, but I need to start saving for college. The sperm donor is being a bastard and it doesn't look like he's planning on chipping in anything. Besides I'm closer to 18 which means I am in BIG trouble. See the sperm donor told me things are going to change. Sure I'm still going to live at home, I'm just going to start having a share in the bills that need to be paid. That's why my decision of going away for college is becoming stronger. I mean whats going to be the difference? I still need to assume responsibility both ways. And I truly have no idea what I am going to do in life. Thats why I need a job. At least if I have money for the necessities I can survive for a couple of years, until I decide what to do. <i>I hope I do figure out what I want to do</i>. 

Then theres the fact that I wanted to join a gym. I need to look ok, in my POV, in order to feel good about myself. I know no one is truly happy with how they look, there are ppl who do, but I just happen to be one of these ppl who are unhappy with themselves. If I got to change how I look not only will it be better for my health but it will boost my confidence. I am a tormented soul on the inside therefore only I can fix this. BUT, <i>yea here's that but again</i>, I have no car or way of being transported. All these things I want to do for myself can't be done because apparently the only way of transportation my mother believes in is driving and walking. I cannot walk there seeing as there aren't any available jobs around my house. My mother distrusts the bus so the only thing left is a car. I dont have one and I see that the sperm donor will not be giving me one ever. My mom always says that we cant fix the transportation later. I dont know how seeing as I can't go out to do these things. How am I really supposed to go out and get a job when I <b>can't</b> look for one? How am I supposed to go to a gym if I <b>can't</b> get there? I swear. I have wasted my summer once more. I might as well wait till I'm 18 but I dont see how much that will change. *sigh* How depressing this is. Ciaos ppl.

"event","<p>Well I spent my whole evening with the sperm donor and my brother. It wasn't bad but I'm not dying to do it again, although our Sunday's are turning out this way now that my mother works weekends. Well he took us to Blockbuster and they had a big ""NOW HIRING"" sign. Of course I wanted to sign up but someone was more eager for me to sign up. So I didn't. There are two reasons why I didn't sign up and they are...

1. I did it just to spite him.
2. I did it just to spite him.

I'm stupid huh? Well here's why I didn't really sign up. He already complains enough as it is when I ask for something. So he <s>figures</s> <u>knows</u> that by me getting a job he will be rid of me financially. (It's not like he hasn't mentioned it before, I swear he's more excited about me turning 18 than I am.) But if I do get a job, for my personal needs, then wat is he going to be there for? I would rather suffer than have him waste money, that should be spent on me, to some bitch he just met. Yes, thats why the sperm donor earned his name (he's unfaithful). I already don't talk to him unless it's to ask him for something. So what will I say to him if I can get everything I want on my own? He then was talking to me and saying that he'd still support me but I would have money to spend it on more things that I wanted. That whole speech sounded like BS to me. Sure I would believe him, but he's gone back on his word so many times I really am at a loss. It's like a person who sugar coats everything, but when it comes down to face the music he doesn't even give you a warning and just leaves you there, all dolled up. I feel more angry at myself than at him. So I plan on going back there sometime this week and signing up...

On Other news

Seeing as this week has been full of thunder storms it seems as if my printer has died, again. I never turn it off, even though I swear I did but then I used it sometime and forgot to turn it off. Oh well thank god for insurances. The problem is that it's going to take some convincing to get the sperm donor to take me to change it. *rolls eyes* <i>As if I don't got other convincing topics to argue</i>. My computer virus also decided to expire this week now I got to pay for a new one. I got this new one that came with my internet service, McAfee, but for some reason I just don't trust it. I expect my computer to go hay wire within this month. And to install this McAfee, I had to uninstall my other one. Well I did. And <b>NOW</b> the sperm donor was asking me how much it costs so I can pay for it. Ugh! I have to pay extra now because it's not an upgrade anymore, it's a whole new freaking purchase. 

As if things couldn't get anymore worse I got my cousins 15's that are coming up, which is a very big deal to my family and me (She's my god-sister) because I still got no dress. My mother works every damn day in the afternoon which means she can only take me in the morning. And it seems stupid to be absent from school when it's already over! Oh and not to mention I still have SAT's to study for which those damned email questions are difficult seeing as I may have gotten only 7 right so far. We get a question per day. I signed up maybe last month, you do the math. Well thats all for now. The only good thing from today was that I got movies! ^_^ arrivederci ppl.

"event","<p>Well I haven't been in the best of moods lately. This teenage hormone thing is kicking my ass. It's like the world is against me. I dont know why but I feel as if I haven't been happy in such a long time it's sad. I have nothing going on for me right now, and it doesn't help when ppl put my insecurities out there. I guess I am emotionally unstable. I don't really know what I want. It seems as if everyone if finding someone to be happy with, or about. But once again I'm left alone. Ppl say things will come at the time they're supposed to. But I feel as if I've been waiting forever. My mom says that if something hasn't happened it's because its not meant to happen, yet. I feel as if I'm missing out on stuff tho. I'm living vicariously right now, but is it a bad thing to want to experience things yourself? Because I dont think I can wait any longer. It's as if I'm being left behind and those types of things aren't going to be meant for me. <s>Maybe that's why I've been in a bad mood lately?</s> I know thats why I have been in a bad mood lately. I do feel jealous because I kno of people who have things going for them. So wats wrong with me? Why not me? Why do I have to wait so long? Will my time ever come. This truly does suck. I mean I do enjoy having my friends care about me but sometimes you need someone else besides your friends to make you feel important. (Not that you ppl ever make me feel important, I just know that you care). I have a feeling this little ""depression"" is going to last for a very long time. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm yearning for affection. The problem is that who's going to be the person that does it?"

The sad part though is that I can already feel it ending. I told myself that one day I was going to stay in bed all day and watch tv, O and get up to eat occasionally if I don't end up bringing it to bed with me. This will, however, happen once I hit college and leave from my house, seeing as Martha will <u>never</u> let me lounge around. But thats basically what I've been doing during my break and occasionally logging online to see if any of you ppl are on, unfortunately I am disappointed everytime.

"event","<p>Well today was the final end to one strenuous week. I made it through this week, Just barely though. I almost didn't make it by 6th period. I swear that bitch is going to get it one day. I had no problems with anybody else. In fact if my day was hectic today it was because of her. I was determined to do everything right because I knew she'd pull some stunt and would try to get slick. So she calls us up to turn in capstone. I'm one of the first because of my last name. So I go up and I put in everything the book asked for. She said ""I want everything the book is asking for"" So I put everything in. Then she said she wasn't asking for everything I put in my paper. So she threw my capstone papers back at me. You don't know how badly I had to restrain myself. The bitch dared to throw my papers back at me?! So she started saying how ""you students never listen then you say I didn't say anything..."" But I let it go. She might just not grade my capstone papers if I did anything. Then we took a test which I failed. That shit was not easy. That was too much to remember. So then she takes attendance, after everything is done. When she calls my name I keep saying ""Here"" but she doesn't hear nor see because the class was being so loud and there were people standing in front of her desk. So she marked me absent. Then she calls the role again with the people who had been marked ""absent"", so when the ""absent"" people say ""here"" she replied with ""Oh now you're here."" I couldn't hold myself back any longer. so when she told that to me I replied with ""Well then maybe if you would have listened the first time. You would have heard me say I was here"" so she started muttering about how kids in her class don't want to listen then they blame her for it. I wanted to be kicked out. I swear that lady is such a <b>BITCH!</b>In a bad way too. I normally like the word bitch but this one takes it too far. There is no better word for her. Let her grade my capstone then I'll cuss her out. She was being bitchy to our class today, but then again that was usual. She treated so many kids wrong. Let me find out what car is hers and I bet you I'll key that shit, even though I hear her car is nice. But anyways I came on to say...
<font size=5>CAPSTONE IS DONE!!! It is finally OVER!</font>...Ok bye ppls.

<br />of most people, and consider them weak and

But there's something wrong with me
It hurts to know that you can't even notice
But I guess I shouldn't have expected much out of you.
There's something wrong with me
And I can't quite define it
It's a pain thats carried inside me
That I can't quite admit.
Maybe it's because I'm scared of what you might think
But why should you care?
You never have anyway.
It just saddens me that you still don't know who I am.
I'm always there for you but you can't see when I need you?
Pity, and I expected much out of you
I guess I expected <b>too</b> much.
I hope I'm not dying on the inside
even though I feel as if I am, maybe you will see me then?
Who knows, I'll probably be long gone by then.
I didn't want to tell you because by now you should have noticed.
I don't look the same as I used to
I don't talk the same way I used to
I don't carry myself around as I usually do
But the sadness in my eyes,
despite the smile that I've carried upon my face,
<b>Should</b> have been a dead give away.
But of course you wouldn't notice
There's something wrong with me
And that something is you.

Ok this too was inspired by something. A little argument I had with the sperm donor. But expect more of these random short stories/poems or w/e they are, I have a list of topics I want to cover."

"event","<p><i>I don't know how to tell you what I feel because words cannot express how I truly feel. I can say something but mean another and I'm not ready to take that chance. I'd rather not tell you than to be misunderstood and rejected for what I feel. Sometimes the feeling is too strong, but I don't <b>LOVE</b> you. And then other times I <b>LIKE</b> you but it's too much to fit under such a diminishing word. Nothing I say can truly explain what I feel. And they say that actions speak louder than words but I'm not used to showing off for the people I care about. If I had to show off to get your attention then I really wouldn't be true to myself, because the real me would never do that. As you can see I am really stuck here because I don't know what to do. I do know that I haven't really felt this before so it sort of scares me. I don't know what this means. I guess I want answers to questions that can't be answered but can you blame me? I have no idea what you are thinking and if you are thinking at all about me, or this. There really is no point in all this, then is there? This is just something I've been trying to get out there and I feel sort of lifted now that I have. I really wish I knew how you felt then maybe that would help me out. Many times I am tempted to go up to you, but there is always the feeling that you wont even know who I am. I'd rather hold this all in than suffer a humiliation to the person whose become my obsession. Yes I do take pride in who I am. So why should I belittle myself if you feel the same way? Why can't <u>you</u> do it? The humiliation should be both ways shouldn't it? But then again that's why I think that this</i>, what ever we can call it, <i>is only one sided. Otherwise you would have done something about it</i>."

<center>The End...</center>

Not Really You know I must rant.

<p>I thought the purpose of a nap was to take away the tired-ness away and waking up feeling refreshed. I found out it's not like that at all, unless its the weekend. In fact I wake up sleepier and cranky because I didn't do what I was supposed to do. And it's also time consuming. I usually wake up at 7-8 if I take a nap. Not now. Now I actually wake up 9-10 which leaves me no time to do anything. This is annoying. Maybe if I stopped taking Naps it would help? No. I tested that out already, I couldn't wake up the next day. And I don't understand why because if I fall asleep earlier then it should give me more hours of sleep. But somehow my body takes missing naps as if I've pulled an all nighter. I can see me now...I will not survive college."

"event","<p>Well today wasn't such a bad day, it wasn't the greatest either. Despite going into a coma during first period I managed to liven up sometime around lunch time. Who knew classes could be so boring. Anyways I prefer today over tomorrow any day. Today was my good/bad luck day.</p>

1. My last piece of gum fell out when I was talking, <i>yes embarrassing I kno</i> but suprisingly I didn't care for that. I was more concerned with losing my <u>last</u> piece of gum.

2. I tripped going into my fifth period. My teacher had a good laugh and so did I. Once again this didn't really bother me I had a good laugh as well. 

3. I was trying to catch up to my friend and once again my foot landed on some sort of ditch, which wasn't that deep, and I almost fell. This resulted in another good laugh. 

<p>I wonder why I was in such good spirits today. We all know I'm usually moody. This is a question that goes under those unsolvable ones. (I love that episode of Spongebob ""The Camp Fire/ Sea-bear"". LOL That camp fire song is hilarious! Especially the part where squidward gets attacked right after each Sea-bear attack. Well this was much more of a ""remember that day"" entry.

First Off, <b>HAPPY NEW YEARS!!!</b>

Ok on to buisness. I still don't have a car *cries* It's sad how my life has really changed. But hopefully we'll be getting a car very soon *crosses fingers* Second of all *GASP* <b>The Victoria Secret Semi Annual Sale starts Tomorrow!!!!</b> I thought it was till June! *cries* I have money I just don't have a car. Man I can't believe I'll have to wait another year! Oh the torture! I can feel the stab in my heart. Me and Victoria Secret have this relationship, but now it has decided to stab me! *cries* I'm going to get there. I hope it lasts for a week. I might get a ride from my family or friends???... *hint hint*... LoL kidding But I would greatly appreciate it. Anyways moving on...LoL thats was it. It was to tell you about the Victoria Secret thing. I am obsessed. I kno. Anyways. I didn't go to school today because I didn't think it was the right time to go back...(O the Sperm Donors Back...Well I g2g because Family Guy has started and I'm missing it. Sorry if this was pointless and doesn't make sense. Hey, you didn't have to read it.

"event","<p> Well this christmas break hasn't been too bad, so far. I've neglected all my school work which is bad but I can't help it. Not thinking about school work makes me happy, and lord knows I need happiness once in a while. So I didn't get anything for christmas. Sad but this is what happens when you only have a sperm donor. I can't ask much from my mother because she already does enough for me. So despite (sp?)the lack of presents this year I was happy with christmas. I spent it at my grandmother's house, which was boring because although they can have enough money to spoil us they will never get with the technology of today. Which in other words means they have no cable tv or many electrical appliances so no entertainment there...

OMG that was soo funny. I am serious about my grandparents not knowing how to use electrical devices. You know the scene in Harry Potter when the Weasley's learn how to use the ""Fellyphone""? That's exactly how it is when I talk to my grandparents over the phone. They shout to the other end. I swear it cracks me and my mom up everytime. Sometimes they even forget to hang up so we have to drive to their house to hang up the phone for them...

Anyways back to what I was saying. So for christmas my grandparents decided to buy a TV, trust me they needed an upgrade. Too bad that they only have one and it doesn't even have cable. I would have made them buy a DVD player too but hey they just got the hang of the VCR why trouble them with a DVD. So christmas was kind of boring but at the same time I didn't mind. I spent it reading the latest potter book, <i>I wonder how long can I put off reading the book</i>, which only reminds me of our love/hate relationship. <i>Yes I have relationships with books. Pathetic? I know</i>. But Anyways I can't complain much about christmas because as I said before it wasn't that bad. Then today I went to open the mail and thats when this feeling of drowning started sinking in. I got like 5 more college letters, they are really starting to bother me. I feel like I'm being harassed. I wish I could put out a restriction warrant on mail. I guess it's the pressure of these damned colleges that are dragging me down when I don't want to be dragged down. But anywho on other news my mothers car broke down yesterday. This is both a blessing and a curse. One we'll finally have a new car but two it comes with a heavy price. We are financially unstable especially since the sperm donor isn't in the country. We need a car but we have no money. My family, bless them, has offered to help by getting us a car. The problem is that my mom will have to pay them back but with what money? My mom doesn't get alot of money and the sperm donor doesn't help for shit. It's times like these that I wish i did have a job. But I can't exactly get a job because of them and the fact that I have no transportation. But I'm going to work around that and see what I end up with. So I guess we will have a new car pretty soon and I hope things go in favor of my mom because she does need that car. It's times like these that make you appreciate the things you have. I always think and consider it but never actually take time to appreciate it.

<marquee>Well thats all for now see ya.</marquee>

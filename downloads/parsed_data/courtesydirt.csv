"event","Sometimes I just have those days where I need to be told I'm beautiful.
Today just seems like one of those days.
Insecurity is ridiculous.
I most likely need to get over it.

Ah but that would mean being much more independent than I am.

That thought itself scares me...

Being alone...
Scares the shit out of me.

These are my goals a year from now:
Learn how to tell the difference if someone is in love with the idea of me or me myself.
Learn that being alone does not always have to be a scary thing.
Learn to tell myself I am beautiful everyday,I shouldn't need someone else to tell me."

"event","I wonder if he will ever love me like I love him.  I would do anything for him.  I guess I wonder if he would do the same.  I am not dramatic just curious.  If you really think about it, would anybody really do anything for someone? I don't know.  I personally believe that I would for him... But I guess you never know if you pass a test until after you take it."

I bought all black and punk clothes.  Then I dyed my hair pink.  After that I pierced ten holes in my ears.  I also got a terrible tattoo"

"event","I cannot say why I decided to get another live journal.  I haven't had one for almost three years.  It used to be a good place to see a lot of teenage bullshit.  However, this time I don't feel like putting up with stupid drama... So I won't.  I will talk, and hope other people will talk to me.  I don't really care.  Anyways, hopefully this time I won't regret getting a live journal.  Happy Thanksgiving!"

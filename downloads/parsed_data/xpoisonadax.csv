I have a sore throat.&nbsp; Also, my head is killing me.&nbsp; However, life is good.&nbsp; I have been in State College for two days (I'm on sabbatical from Pittsburgh, since things have gotten not so swell there) and so far, I have had nice times with some dear friends, most importantly, Colette. :-)
Tomorrow we're supposed to climb Mount Nittany, but my head hurts like crap.&nbsp; We'll see what happens.

Oh, important facts to know:

-I will be at the University of Wisconsin next year (my first choice!)
-I got a job interview, which will dictate whether or not I spend remaining summer at home or at school.
-I saw Iron Man twice so far with the same person.
-Once last summer I got drunk and wrote a fan letter to Queen Latifah.&nbsp; It started off--""Dear Queen Latifah"" hehe

"event","Tonight I participated in Take Back the Night, which is an event where men and women gather to go on a march around campus and State College to promote awareness of the sexual assaults and abuse that take place every day here at Penn State.&nbsp; Men and women shared their stories, and we got to yell and hold up signs.&nbsp; <br />I even got to chant into a megaphone (now THERE'S a story for the grandkids).<br /><br />Here's what's making me mad--<br />Penn State is getting rid of its Sexual Assault program that students are required to take as part of their orientation day.&nbsp; Why, you may ask?&nbsp; So that there can be more time for students to learn about clubs offered on campus, and to make the whole experience more happy--We are in Happy Valley, after all.&nbsp; Here's what's not so happy--thousands of women (and some men) are raped yearly here at Penn State, and only 10% of sexual assaults are reported.&nbsp; Justice is rarely found for any of these men or women.&nbsp; Now, The sexual assault program that was in place wasn't so great, but something is better than nothing, correct?&nbsp; Some ridiculous statistic, something like 1 in 8 or 1 in 6 women are going to be sexually violated in their lifetime.&nbsp; Is that fair?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Is that cool? No!&nbsp; Do women deserve to be raped ever? NO!&nbsp; Do men deserved to be raped ever?&nbsp; NO WAY JOSE!&nbsp; <br /><br />How does Kika suggest we remedy this problem?--Keep the sexual assault program, and have a mandatory involvement fair that students can attend during lunch or before/after their other activities.&nbsp; We have a library open house that is technically mandatory,but if you go you have the opportunity to win prizes and get free pens and bus tokens--if you did the same thing for an orientation day involvement fair, more kids would go.&nbsp; EVEN THOUGH WE ALREADY HAVE AN INVOLVEMENT FAIR IN THE FALL <font size=""4"">AND PENN STATE MAKES YOU GO TO A BULLSHIT RALLY WHERE YOU LEARN ALL THE PENN STATE CHEERS AND WHAT CLUBS THERE ARE ON CAMPUS ANYWAY!!!!!!<br /><font size=""2""><br />Thank you, and good night.</font></font>"

"event","I have been home for a few days now, but I haven't written in this thing for a while.

In case any of you are wondering, my cell phone hasn't been working for the past two weeks (or so)...So if you called, I'm sorry.  It hasn't been working.  Also, I wasn't in town the past two weeks, so I couldn't have been of much service.

So there was Arts Fest--that's all I'm going to say about it.  On my way home from Arts Fest, Tim McGovern from U of IL. called and asked if I would like to come to Madeline Island and play in a woodwind quintet.  I said, sure, when should I get there.  And do you know what he said?

..""uh, yesterday.""  So I called Liz and asked if I could borrow her holding mandrel, then I went home, bought a plane ticket, and at 9:45 the next morning, I was flying in a little crappy plane to Cleveland.  Then to Minneapolis, then Duluth, Minnesota.  And I was there for a week, played some great music, made some new friends, and got it into my head that the Netherlands would be the PERFECT place to go to grad school.

Sunday the 23rd I drove for 5 1/2 hours to Minneapolis from Madeline Island, then waited around the airport for four and a half hours 'til my plane was supposed to leave for Chicago.  I only had an hour and three minutes to change planes in Chicago, which wasn't so bad, but I didn't have an awful lot of room for error.  I got to my gate, and what did I see?  My flight was delayed 45 minutes.  Which meant I only had 18 minutes to change planes.  Not great.  Then, I overheard the dude at the desk say the flight was delayed another ten minutes.  It was leaving at 7:40.  Which meant it wouldn't get into Chicago 'til 9:06.  My plane was boarding at 8:45.  What the crap, right?  I asked the dude at the desk what I should do, and he asked me, ""Do you run fast?""  To which I replied...""uh.  No?""  He told me there was a direct flight to Pittsburgh but it was leaving in ten minutes and I would have to run to Concourse B--of course, I was in Concourse E at the time.  So I ran with my carry-on and my bassoon which is heavy as crap and made it with four minutes to spare.  Beautiful story.  The only problem was, I was getting into Pittsburgh at 9:50, but my luggage wouldn't arrive until 11:39.  But whatev--I made it home and safe and happy.

Then--flipping Cosi fan Tutte lady emailed me at 10, saying she was having a rehearsal the next day at 7:30.  Which I didn't go to because I had exactly one day to get my affairs in order and go to Muncie for IDRS.  That was a flippin' blast (more on that later).  

So now I'm home.  I still have to teach some lessons, take some lessons, Cosi Fan Tutte and a family vacation to deal with, then school comes.  A welcome relief. ;)"

"event","Hola cats and kittens--

I want to bring back 20th century vernacular--because it's cooler than things the young people are saying today.

Words that I hate that have become an integral part of today's vernacular:
-Random (my skin crawls when I think of this word.  I'd strike it from the dictionary if I had the power).
-Beotch (what?)
-Jiggy (do people still say that?  In any event, I hate it)
-Basically any words rappers use that I don't understand.

Words/terms I'd like to bring back:
-Fly/superfly (this one cracks me up)
-Righteous 
-The bee's knees
-swell


So I know that when someone says ""that's sick,"" it can be a positive thing, but once, I was showing my friend pictures from Honduras and he said, ""That is SO disgusting.""  I asked him why and he was like, ""Oh, that's a good thing.""

Where have I been the last two years that I missed out on all these language changes?

Oh...now I remember.  In a practice room, wasting my youth.  Speaking of which, I have a lesson with David Sogg tomorrow and I didn't practice yesterday, but I did practice Saturday through Tuesday.  So I took one day off...sue me.  Anyway, gotta go!"

"event","So here I am.  It is June 26 in the very early morning.  I'm kind of tired.

I feel bad for all the people who I don't call back.  It's nothing against you.  I just hate my cell phone and am trying not to use it, because my bill has been outrageous.  Not only that, but I am not good at talking on the phone at all.  At least, not any more.  When it rings I never know what to say so I just ignore it, basically.  But I do get your messages, and I will text you back, if you are allowed.  Or I will just call you in a few days.  So leave me messages if you would like a phone call back, but don't expect it for a few days, unless of course it is time-sensitive.  If I don't call you back and it was time-sensitive, that means I got it too late anyway.

So I haven't worked all summer.  I haven't really practiced too much either (as in, not like I normally do).  I basically wake up late, read all day, take a nap, make reeds and watch TV, and go to bed.  Sometimes people come over.  I should say, sometimes Hannie and/or Tony's friends comes over, and we watch TV.  Wow, my life is bleak.  But the fact of the matter is, after living at Penn State with a roommate for two semesters, it's nice just to be on one's own.  Not that I don't love Lauren, because I do.  And I miss her terribly.

It's funny how people who are so important to you in high school just kind of fade into everyone else, and how people you've only known maybe two years become your everything.  I think that's probably how it was at the beginning of high school, too, but I just haven't experienced it in a while.  After your freshman year, you still have at least some common experiences and whatnot.  After your sophomore year, not so much.  I don't know, I guess it's just hard for me to know what to say and what to do around anyone, frankly, because...I don't know.  I don't have anything to talk about.  And a lot of home friends aren't intent on just sitting in silence while I look for things to say.  And I'm too broke to just go to the movies all the time.

Certain home friends have REALLY changed.  I won't name names, but certain people expect me to bend over backwards to help him, and be a friend to him, and pick him up from the bus station at flipping four in the morning, but when you expect that he'll come through for you, he doesn't.  

I was so mad the other day when Certain Person's stoner friend called MY cell phone looking for him, and when I said he was with me, Stoner Friend said, ""Oh man...can I like, talk to him for a minute?""  I mean, I could see if Stoner Friend were my friend too, but since he isn't, I took great offense.  I am not Certain Person's answering service.  FURTHERMORE, the reason Stoner friend called was because he was already at Certain Person's house and was just waiting for him to show up so they could light up the bonfire...among other things.  Even though Certain Person and I had been planning our evening for a while.  Whatever.  I have no problem with weed if it doesn't interfere with your life, but if people--much like Stoner Friend--go from high school to no school and working at Shop'n'Save the rest of their life to support the weeds, that is ridiculous.  It wouldn't be ridiculous if Stoner Friend weren't unhappy in his position.  It also wouldn't be ridiculous if Stoner Friend didn't look down on me because I'm not a Pothead.  Whatever.  Stoner Friend will be miserable at Shop'n'Save and someday after college I will be happy as a starving artist.  You know.

Things I'm looking forward to:

Arts Fest!  July 14-16 if I stay up there.  
IDRS Convention!  July 25-29
North Pittsburgh Phil!!!!!  Mmmhmmm.
Winning all the scholarships I applied for!!!

All I want to do is do homework.  Yeah.  Because when I'm not tonicizing or highlighting or writing or putting off my homework, I really have no purpose on this earth.  My job didn't start yet, I only have like, three friends, I have no money so to speak (since I'm not in school I feel guilty about taking my parents' money), I'm running out of books on my booklist....
Yeah, there is the bassoon, but without any lessons, I'm like a lost sheep.  Pathetic, I know.  But all I want to do is play stuff that sounds pretty (ie-stuff I can play).  I'm in need of some direction.  
I can make reeds, but man...I only have six blanks left--this will not last me the end of the summer.  Which means I have to go up to Penn State to profile.  Which means I have to call Daryl Durran.  And this just CANNOT be.  Oh heck.  AND, I am giving a bassoon lesson on Thursday and I don't actually know what to teach.
I bought shoes today and then I went to the arts festival with my dad and my sister.  Daisee got bored so she rode the bus back to her apartment (wimp) and my dad and I had an enjoyable afternoon.  I went in the incline museum and I now know how it works.  Mmmmhmmm.  AND, I ate at the Oyster House (my favorite ever.)  There's nothing better than fish and hot sauce.  Gosh.  Hot sauce is delicious.  You can put it on anything and it makes it more delicious.  (Shiznit, it's 2:30 in the morning and I'm going crazy. teehee.)

I miss Penn State and all the boys that I can stare at up there.  And being able to do whatever I wanted whenever I want.  And, my parents had no idea when I went out and spent money (which they do now).  

My glasses broke in half (again) so I got new ones.  They're CLASSSSY!  hehe.  They came with a fancy case and a fancy cleaning cloth and a fancy card of authenticity (because they're Prada).  I felt so fancy.  And I love my new glasses.

I went to my family reunion.  My mom has 49 first cousins that she knows of.  That grosses me out.  I have four.  But as for second/third cousins, I have over 100.  On my mom's side alone.  This makes me uneasy.

On Saturday we went to Shadyside and ate at an AMAZING Peruvian restaurant.  Then Tony and I went to shoot pool with some folks.  Afterwards we came here with some pool people and shot off fireworks.  Anthony brought a police scanner and all the sudden we hear ""There is a report of nine gun shots in the vicinity of the Beagle Club"" and everyone was like, ""RUN!!!!""  It was so funny.

I came home on the 5 o'clock bus and was met by my father at 10. :)  We talked about stuff.  I got home and sat around with my brother and talked about life.  This morning I got up at 10 because I couldn't breathe (I have bronchitis), and Tony and I decided to go to a rummage sale.  That stunk, so we went to the movies and saw Jarhead (Excellent movie.)  I picked up my mom from the SCBWI conference and we got dinner, then we realized we had totally forgot about Tony's gallery opening tonight, and my parents and I were going to the symphony.  So we rushed home, got changed, dropped Tony off at his opening.  My parents and I ate at the Oyster House and took a walk downtown.  Tonight was Orpheus by Liszt, Tchaik Violin concerto, Magical Metamorphisis in 12 modes (I can't spell the Italian) and Pines of Rome by Resphigi.  Wow.....Wow.  Pieces like Pines of Rome remind me why I spend my life in a practice room instead of sleeping/eating/partying/homework/doin' it/etc.  Mmmm mmmm.

I love the city.  Pittsburgh is my favorite place.  I've been to New York and Boston and Chicago and Atlanta and Baltimore and Miami and Cleveland....Pittsburgh is definitely my favorite, next to Tegucigalpa, but one does form certain attachments to the city in which they were born.  

It makes me mad that I can't talk to people about things that are important to me.

I came home Thursday night with Liz (we giggled the whole way) and I went home and had some sake with Tony and looked at his pictures.  They are amazing.  He's so talented.  The next day I woke up and got a haircut (A much deserved haircut) and bought clothes at Aeropostale with my mom.  We picked up Tony and went to the South Side because he is submitting his work to the Silver Eye for a contest.  We bummed around and I bought a purple coat at Diva's and played with a puppy.  We visited the Beehive (coolest coffee shop ever) and I had a really yummy sandwich.  Daisee got out of school so she took the T to Station Square and we all had a VERY early dinner at the Gandy Dancer.  At night Daisee and I met up with DJ and went to the football game.  We left at halftime and went to King's with Colette, Amanda, and Trey.  Trey ate my pancakes but it was okay because I ate his biscuits.  Score.  

Saturday I slept in late and did a little work, then we went to the Montour Trail potluck, which was a lot of fun.  I rode my dad's recumbent bike and crashed it.  Score.  I went on a walk with my mom and then we all came home to change for the play.  We saw Roleplay tonight which I thought was REALLY cute.  It made me happy.  The main character (Justin)....friggin' hot.  We came home and I watched Ernest Scared Stupid with my mom then I went and picked up Daisee at Westpointe.  Now I'm here.  I deleted ALL the music off my iPod.  But it's ok. I saved it on my computer at home.

I rode the bus with a very nice young man, and as it turned out, I used to do PMEA events with his sister.  Righteous :)  I got home at midnight and enjoyed a bowl of homemade lentil soup and I watched Raising Helen with my mom.  It was funny.  I basically studied on Saturday and watched TV, and then my parents, Tony, and I went downtown to see the symphony (and my dad sang in it).  We were going to go to the Cuban buffet place by Heinz Hall but it was closed, so we ate at a little Chinese place (it's on Penn Avenue I think).  Anyway, Carmina Burana was INCREDIBLE.  Mnom Ford was the baritone and he was amazing.  The tenor was AMAZING.  The soprano was a soprano...you know (I can't help that I prefer low voices).  It was really sad because Martin Smith (Co-Principal Horn) died on Friday night, and the symphony folks didn't find out until 6:30 on Saturday.  It must have been tragic, because he wasn't all that old.  He went to Julliard when he was like, 12 I think.  Holy cow.  But anyway, today my mom bought me an iPod as a ""fee"" for some work I'm doing for her.  Woo yeah.  I've been playing with it.  I think I broke my cell phone.

Cockblocking is bad. I think we can all agree on that. But what's worse than a cockblock is the cock block cock knock, which is, of course, when you cockblocking someone by actually punching them in the cock. But what's worse than that is the beef-stock-cock-block-cock-knock, which is when you hit someone in the cock with a pot of beef stock. This is bad, because not only does it prevent sex and cause cock pain, but it also can leave burns, and will get them wet and make them smell like beef. But what's worse is the beef-stock cock-block cock-knock on-spock, which is when you do the cockblocking while sitting on Leonard Nimoy. But what's even worse than that is the hard-rock beef-stock cock-block cock-knock on-spock, which is when you do it while listening to Metallica. But what's worse is the John-Locke hard-rock beef-stock cock-block cock-knock on-spock, which is when whilst this is all going on, Leonard Nimoy is reading philosophy aloud. But a worse variety is the John-Locke hard-rock beef-stock cock-block cock-knock on-spock with-Bach, which is when the Metallica you're listening to is Metallica doing a cover of a Bach symphony. But what's even worse is the ham-hock John-Locke hard-rock beef-stock cock-block cock-knock on-spock with-Bach, which is, clearly, when, while this all happens, you have somebody feeding your victim ham. But what's worse yet is the boat-dock ham-hock John-Locke hard-rock beef-stock cock-block cock-knock on-spock with-Bach, that being when this all takes place on a pier. But we must not forget the infamous boat-dock ham-hock John-Locke hard-rock beef-stock cock-block cock-knock on-spock with-Bach sans-chalk. This is when, before the clockblocking is undertaken, you make absolutely certain that every possible trace of chalk is cleared from the pier. But there's also the yet worse third-rock boat-dock ham-hock John-Locke hard-rock beef-stock cock-block cock-knock on-spock with-Bach sans-chalk, which is when John Lithgow watches you commit the cockblockery. But the absolute worst, the most evil, horrid, and despicable cock-block of all, is the sheep-flock third-rock boat-dock ham-hock John-Locke hard-rock beef-stock cock-block cock-knock on-spock with-Bach sans-chalk, which, I think, is pretty self explanatory.

I was at Borders yesterday.  She gave me a book called ""Searching for God Knows What"" by Donald Miller, and she lent me ""Blue Like Jazz"" by the same author.  I am also working my way through the Chronicles of Narnia and the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books.  The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and (I think) Morality for Beautiful Girls are my favorites of each respective series.  I love books with great names like ""The Sound and the Fury"" by Faulkner or ""Blue Like Jazz,"" ""Morality for Beautiful Girls.""  I am only taking the books that I want to read really badly up to school with me.

I leave in FIVE DAYS!  I'd love to have a bonfire but I don't see that happening, unfortunately.  I'll have to hang out with everyone individually (boo! teehee).

I miss my bassoon so much.  The poor darling is in the shop.  AYTEN!!!

"event","I quit my job for good.  Heck yeah.  I'm never going back.  There were some really great people who worked there, but then again there were some real...let's just say ""characters"" who I'd rather not see again.  You know.  Can't wait to go back to school.  I'm planning on doing these things:

-Practice at least 2 hours a day (At most 4 or five) and work on reeds an hour a day.
-Churn out at least a two or three reeds a week.
-Get into SWE
-Pledge SAI
-Swim and/or go to the gym three times a week.
-Sell plasma
-Party moderately
-Make a lot of new friends

MMMMHMMMM.  Time to watch ""Out Cold.""

Peace!

"event","<P>I got a check from EMF today for $500.&nbsp; Cha ching!</P>
<P>I'm saving it for cell phone bills.&nbsp; When they roll in and I have no income.&nbsp; You know how that can be.&nbsp; College in less than three weeks.&nbsp; I'm not packed or anything.&nbsp; I called Amanda and myself off next friday to go to the Washington County fair, so if anyone is interested, let me know.&nbsp; The FAIRRRR is here!&nbsp; The fair!&nbsp; The fair!!!&nbsp; </P>
<P>I was on a roll there for a while about practicing.&nbsp; Then when I started working again I kinda started to stink.&nbsp; Wendy's is a physical and emotional drain.&nbsp; I hate it so much.&nbsp; I like most of the people, but just the atmosphere is just so hateful and negative.&nbsp; What I find ironic is the fact that the two people on the crew who are made fun of the most because they are, well let's just say slow (even though they are <EM>people</EM>, just like you and me), they are the best people to have conversations with.&nbsp; Geez louise, they are sharp.&nbsp; Just 'cuz they aren't fast as far as Wendy's is concerned, they're good for an intelligible conversation.</P>
<P>I talked to my mom for like, an hour and a half today.&nbsp; We talked about the Red Light district in Amsterdan, which she has been to with my dad.&nbsp; It's nothing like I would have imagined it.&nbsp; Then we talked about the rest of Europe, how she got sick in Paris, riding the boat down the Rhine, and then we discussed the book of Samuel.&nbsp; Then we talked about C.S. Lewis and how brilliant my brother is, if he would just pull his head out of his butt.&nbsp; My family is brilliant.&nbsp; There is not a single question I could ask my mom that she wouldn't know, or wouldn't be able to find out easily.&nbsp; Usually if I stump her I ask Tony, who usually does know.&nbsp; If it's a math question, I go straight to my dad.&nbsp; I'm so blessed.&nbsp; </P>
<P>My life&nbsp;can be&nbsp;hard, but it's absolutely&nbsp;perfect.</P>

Anyway, things are great.  Last night Amanda and I had a party with about 10 people (give or take...)  I met the man I'm going to marry (at this juncture in my life), and I watched a documentary on Himmler.  What a boobhead.  Anyway,,,,yeah.  I can't think of anything else to talk about.  I made this totally dope reed that I have to ream out a little bit more before I do anything else.  Jiminy Crickets!

Oh, and if anyone else goes to Penn State, do you know when non-freshmen move in?

I'm in Greensboro right now, hangin' out and playin' some mad bassoon.  It's made me realize how I'm not as bad as I think I am and how much more I need to work.  That's all.

"event","I went to vote today and the old crotchety man told me I couldn't.  Then he told me I never registered to vote.  Then I asked for a provisional ballot and he was like, ""hold your horses.""  And then, he realized my name--the name on my driver's license and Student ID lying right in front of him--was Francisca, and not Kika, as my stupid gold Wendy's nametag implies.  One more way in which Wendy's has kicked me in the proverbial nuts.  So I worked 7 and a half hours today.  Tomorrow and Thursday  work 8 and a half.
I'd like to knock that down to 8...we'll see.  

Oh...but Meri Kay called me and asked me to work.  Then I got bamboozled into working there...forever.

grrr!

"event","Sorry dudes...I said all that stuff before I realized how boring and pointless my life is right now.  

I made a reed yesterday.  The tube is sooooooooooo round (very good thing).  It's because I used string instead of Durran's stupid rubber bands that just don't seem to do the trick for me.

I found all the messages I sent over facebook since I got it.  Good for me...
It was a hard year.

Gwen and I went lookin' for jobs but so far, nothin'.  I'm thinking about just going back to Wendy's and telling them I can only work 6 hours a day.  I really do need to play my bassoon more and make mad reeds, but whatever. 

Anyway, good news!  Tony and I will be turning 21 and 19 on May 20th and 21st (respectively) and we would like to cordially invite anyone who is in the area to our birthday bonfire on the 21st at night.  It'll probably start around 10, and if you are a girl and live far away, you can sleep over. :)  If'n you're a boy, take it up with Tony.  Anyway,  I will be at the Rhythm house to see my friend Zach's band (Twisted Fate, or something like that).  That show starts at 7 or 7:30 and it's $7 at the door.  But really, 19 is the worst age to turn and we should make it GOOD by everyone coming to my party and pretending to like me.  And Colette's buyin' me a cowboy hat.  YES!

I thought that when I came home everyone would have gone through my grandma's stuff and things would return to normal, but here we are, three months later, and our house is still full of stuff.  In my opinion, it's because my dad is athiest.

Hey, whatever works for him, but to me, I don't feel the need to hold on to her worldly possessions to be able to still feel connected to her.

"event","I just moved all my stuff from the car to my room, and man...it's rewarding.
I guess I'll save all my leftover food for EMF.  I can eat it there.  Or now. 
Today was Cinco De Mayo, but Hondurans celebrate it too (don't ask me why), so my mom and I made guacamole and salsa (the real kind that isn't all gross tomato sauce-like stuff) and fiesta potatoes.  Then we tried to watch our Buena Vista Social Club (sweeeeeet Cuban jazz band) video, but it is all warped and crappy.  Fortunately, it was only $3.  So I didn't do anything today but sleep and watch stupid movies.  I watched The Others.  Oh my gosh, it scared me.  I guess I haven't seen it in a while.  Good movie, though.  I went to the grocery store.  I saw Mrs. Chambon and she asked me about changing majors--wow...news travels fast.  I kinda see myself as a bassoonist first, the only thing is that I can see myself doing other things too.  I would really like to be a political journalist and be refreshingly non-partisan.  I'm frustrated with the media because it's too slanted (darn you Fox and the NY Times!)  

I absolutely can't stand Madonna.  

Dumbest thing she's ever said--""George Bush should study the Kaballah.""  Yeah,,because ya know that just because you said so Madonna, he would reject Christianity and subsequently end the war in Iraq, legalize abortion, and let gay people get married.
Stupid lady.

"event","So, instead of writing a boring response when it was due, I'm going to write now since a lot of things are now effecting my life.  It's been a stressful past few weeks, since the California trip, it seemed like i was actually ahead in some subjects, but there was a few tests and assignments I overlooked and now that marks are being shown, they're coming back to haunt me.  So I tried to catch up, however I was put on the basketball spring league and finding time to work was hard to come by, when I thought band was over, it turns out that its not close to done, we played at grad, and going to play for Colin Reimer's retirement, and so on and so forth, early mornings and so forth, and when I would find free-time, things would slip my mind and i wouldn't exactly want to work on homework anyways.  So as finals draw nearer, I realized how much little time I have, so I tried to quit the basketball team to free up some time, it was kind of an akward conversation with my coaches trying to tell them i quit, but unfortunatly they just don't let you quit, they made a compromise however and I get some time off to catch up.  So this weekend has been very relaxing, I got to sleep in past 7 in the morning, which is a first in 4 weeks, I got to go to church, which is another first in 4 weeks, and i have time to catch up on homework and relax.  So all in all things have been very hectic and stressful, but hopefully they'll die down a bit as school ends.  So i hope i've covered enough things in there, i've got physical, personal responsabilty, self-care, intellectual, and relational."

"event","Well... No longer are the topics on what I write up on the site, so i'll be going with what I can remember, or more like rambling on whats happening in my life.  In the physical aspect of the world, I've been up to volleyball practices and track meets.  In the BCCSSAA (BC christian secondary schools atheletic asssociation) Track meeet today, I managed to win at all three individual events I entered (100m,200m400m) which set me up for winning the Jr. Boys Division Aggregate award and took a first place in the 4x400m relay and third in the 4x100m relay.  However as easy as that seems, it was very difficult to maintain energy throughout the events, as it seems the track officials find it fun to set all of my events in a row.  I only ended up eating half a sandwich, 2 cookies, and drinking water and some apple juice.  Even 2 hours after i completed the track meet I still found myself unable to eat much, due to the fact of either over excitement or overstressed.  On the other hand however, I went golfing the day before for my sisters Birthday, and found out i'm not a golfer.  Also this week my diets been downhill, lots of chocolate cake and other ice cream desserts.  I havn't been reading my bible as of late, and don't have an excuse for that. I'm also running out of things to say, so if you don't mind putting up the assignment page again, or telling me how to get to it, it'd be nice.

Signing out,
Ryan Koenig"

"event","Alright.. i'm already behind again in my journal.  For choices so far, I've been related to self-care, physical, and spiritual choices this Easter Weekend.  I spent a lot of time just relaxing and hanging out with friends, so I could relieve some stress that has been building from sports, jazz band, concert band, and missing classes in may.  I've also been very physical on Sunday, going skiing up at whislter, and having some of the best dry powder i've seen there ever, also going swind dancing, which is quite a work out as well.  Coming back to the mearning of Easter, I enjoyed a Good Friday church service, and also been reflecting on my life, and asking God for advice of the future.   Today however, I chose to go out to the raspberry fields to spend 4 hours planting raspberries.  So it was both physical work, and occupational."

"event","Just to note, as it pertains to the Spanish national football team doping scandal, &quot;blood doping&quot; is waaaaay different from &quot;steroids&quot; and does not cause weight gain or muscle mass. 

<lj-cut text=""elaboration under cut"">
Blood doping occurs when a doctor takes blood, usually a few weeks before competition, and processes it so that only the red blood cells remain. The athlete keeps training like everything is normal. Then, hours or even minutes before competition, the doctor injects that highly-oxygenated blood back into the athlete. This causes a vastly increased capacity to carry oxygen through the bloodstream and to muscles, and the athlete experiences a huge burst of energy. 

In short, you wouldn't really notice, per say. Blood doping is not like steroids, but it's still cheating. At the same time, we've seen this whole show before in baseball and it was pretty sucky and yet no surprise, so.

"event","So, the World Cup. My feelings are mixed. Germany was so strong, and I was so surprised and disappointed when they crashed out of the semi-finals to an overall inferior Spain. 


But, what's over is over. Tomorrow they play Uruguay for third place, and on Sunday Spain plays Netherlands for the championship. Paul the Octopus, in perhaps a last-minute bid to avoid being cooked and lightly seasoned, has predicted Germany in the 3rd place game and Spain in the finals. 


The Mannschaft has said that they don't want to have a public celebration, like they did in 2006, and while I'm disappointed, I respect their choice. Judging by the way they played at the beginning of the WC, I expected them to win the championship. I guess they did, too, and celebrating an at-best 3rd place finish doesn't seem exciting when facing what could have been. But at the same time, I hope they understand how proud their fans are of them, and recognize just how far they've gotten. There were plenty of also-rans in this tournament, and Germany wasn't one of them. 


So, a happy spam!

Poldi and Miro in a general pile-on-Oezil moment. (And fun fact: I spell his and Mueller's names differently because I CANNOT figure out how to add umlats on my PC. Umlats on Macbooks only.)



Also, I really hope I have made my love of Mesut Oezil clear, because, YES. So young! So full of potential! He has so many goals and bromances to look forwards to on this team. &hearts;

No post is complete without Schweinski! There was a time, a while ago, when they both came out against the idea of Schweinski, saying that the press had come up with it and they had been told to keep it going because it was good publicity. Schweini made a big deal about being his own man. But no one can stop a mancrush this strong, and of course they still hang out and do high fives and ridiculous things. Boys! &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;

so here we go! sylar's first appearance in season 2!

so, for those qgmfs who don't know, Heroes Season 1 ended with a big battle in the center of an industrial park, possibly in Texas. Why no one / the authorities failed to notice this is never explained. Anyway, Hiro (who along with Ando and Mohinder and Matt Parkman form the base of likable characters in this show) stabs Sylar with a sword and Nathan Petrelli carries an about to explode (yeah no i'm not making this up) Peter Petrelli into the skys where they supernova. 

OR DO THEY?

Anyway, battered but alive the other characters leave Sylar for dead. 

BIG MISTAKE.


<center>Welcome to Maui.

This is Michelle, although last season her name was Candice. She's a shape shifter and illusion maker and she likes daquaris and talking on the phone.
<a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/sylar/?action=view&amp;current=16070981.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/sylar/16070981.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a>


And also nursing insane serial killers  back to life.

Sylar doesn't know what's going on and doesn't know who she is. She makes really no effort to explain.

<a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/sylar/?action=view&amp;current=16070983.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/sylar/16070983.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a>

She tells him that it's an illusion, and he demands to see reality. She says that he won't like it, and he gets rough, and then i start to like it and everything spirals out of control.

But she's totally right. He doesn't like reality. 

<a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/sylar/?action=view&amp;current=16070985.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/sylar/16070985.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a>

He wants answers! But she offers daquaris. Delicious looking daquaris. WITH THOSE TINY UMBRELLAS. 

<a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/sylar/?action=view&amp;current=16070987.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/sylar/16070987.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a>


Michelle/Candice tells him not to move, because it will open his stitches again. Sylar notices that he doesn't actually have stitches, and that's when she mentions that, oh hey yeah, she controls reality.

<a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/sylar/?action=view&amp;current=16070988.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/sylar/16070988.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a>

If you can't tell from this cap that Sylar's planning something evil that involves a certain amount of her brain matter soon making a home outside her skull, you clearly have never seen an episode of HEROES.

<a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/sylar/?action=view&amp;current=16070990.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/sylar/16070990.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a>


So like i said, he gets rough and she shows him reality and IT'S REALLY UNPLEASANT IN A SORT OF SEEDY, TRAVELING-BUSINESSMAN-IN-TUB-OF-ICE, ORGAN HARVESTING SORT OF WAY. 
<a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/sylar/?action=view&amp;current=16070991.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/sylar/16070991.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a>


Yeah bb the rumors are true; you're in a tin shed in a rainforest in South/Central America. There are zero levels of sterility, a plywood shelf full of medical supplies, and someone spilled vodka sauce all over Sylar's wound (although i'm willing to believe that they meant it to be iodine). 

Michelle says that his back wound has totally healed and they're only worried about the front, never really mentioning who she works for. But the gist is that she's not here out of some fondness for rescuing stabees in city squares and kidnapping them to rural Honduras.

This is his pissy face. Michelle made him breakfast but he's only interested in BRAIIINS.

All his plans are coming undone! but michelle assures him that with her help, he can get all his powers back. If you haven't figured out that she's working for The Company, well, you need to start doing the reading, jesus.

She's getting a little sick of his bitchiness, we can tell. He's like, how the hell could YOU help? and she tells him that she can make the process EASY. yeah, like that.

What's his fantasy?

TWINS?

haha AMATEUR. clearly, it's himself, which michelle picks up on almost immediately. whatevs, if i looked like that i'd want to fuck me, too.

NOTICE HOW HE DOESN'T DENY IT.

Sylar: Maybe I underestimated you. You <em>are </em>extra-ordinary... just. like. me.

And then he smashes her with the 'nice day' cup.

But something's wrong! he doesn't have her powers! and now that she's dead, he's got sort of a problem on his hands.

I'd also like to open a discussion about how females are only on this show to be raped, about to be raped, or fridged. I usually don't care, you guys, I NEVER react to that feminist reaction like on spn but this is OVERT. painfully overt.

bb realizes that he's fucked. it's a good look but one that Sylar doesn't wear too often.

so, yeah, he's stuck in the middle of nowhere and still has a pretty serious open wound that probably requires some sterilization and maybe an actual doctor. and without his powers, but at least this means The Company is watching.

IMO THIS MOMENT HAS BEEN TOO LONG IN COMING.<br />I actually don't have caps of his very first appearance in season 2, but they will get their own post because it's a pretty awesome moment.<br /><br />This is Sylar, Maya, and her brother... Bernard, or Alejandro or something. IDK, he doesn't have powers and yells a lot, he's just support for Maya. Anyway, Sylar's lost his powers after Hiro killed him at the end of season 1. Maya and Bernard are on the run after Maya caught Bernard's wife and best man doing the horizontal tango at their wedding reception and accidentally killed EVERYONE AT THE WEDDING, WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE ENTIRE TOWN. Needless to say, they're on the run from the police. They think that going to New York to Dr. Suresh, who Sylar has killed and eaten but he doesn't mention that, will help Maya control her powers.<br /><br /><a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/?action=view&amp;current=cap065.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/cap065.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/?action=view&amp;current=cap066.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/cap066.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/?action=view&amp;current=cap067.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/cap067.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/?action=view&amp;current=cap068.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/cap068.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a><br /><br />Bernard doesn't trust Sylar, but Maya does. This leads to a lot of friction, and also a lot of Sylar smirking. Especially because only Maya speaks English, so when they're alone Sylar likes to tell Bernard how good it will feel to kill him and then eat his sister. <br /><br />Most awkward road trip ever.<br /><br />Also, they're crossing borders illegally because the police are after them for some pretty outrageous murders and shit seems to happen in every town they stop in. They find Sylar by the side of the road and agree to help him.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/?action=view&amp;current=cap069.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/cap069.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/?action=view&amp;current=cap070.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/cap070.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/?action=view&amp;current=cap071.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/cap071.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/?action=view&amp;current=cap072.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/cap072.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a><br /><br /><br />This is when they find him. Maya wants to help, Bernard wants to throw him out of the car, and the college kid who stole the car they're driving doesn't really care.<br /><br /><a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/?action=view&amp;current=cap073.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/cap073.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/?action=view&amp;current=cap074.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/cap074.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a><br /><br /><br />He should, though, because Sylar takes a brick and bashes his skull in when the kid confides in him that he's seen the wanted posters for Bernard and Maya and is concerned they're riding with mass murderers. Sylar tells him to call the police and then follows him into the back alley and does what he does best.<br /><br /><a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/?action=view&amp;current=cap075.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/cap075.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a><br /><br />He confronts the twins and they admit it's them, but that Maya never meant to hurt anyone. Maya freaks out and her eyes bleed death (I'm not joking, she CRIES TEARS OF DEATH) and almost kills Sylar but he's really impressed. The seed plants in his mind that if he can convince Maya that she doesn't need Bernard to stop her killing spree, as she always has, then he can get her alone and steal her powers.<br /><br /><a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/?action=view&amp;current=cap076.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/cap076.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://s668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/?action=view&amp;current=cap077.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img border=""0"" src=""http://i668.photobucket.com/albums/vv42/casevac-lj/heroes/cap077.jpg"" alt=""Photobucket"" /></a><br /><br /><br />Maya: What is your name?<br />Sylar: Gabriel.

Their weapons are tied to &quot;handle identification,&quot; which I have to assume is some measure of handle grip and fingerprint identification, but the specifics escape me.

If you think this is ominous foreshadowing and a callback to the fact that the video game the movie is based on actually involves a descent into Hell and not a Mars-based research facility, you are refreshingly correct.</p>

At this point in the film, and I use this term loosely, the entire squad forms up in a V formation and poses for many seconds on what, upon first viewing, seems to be a park lawn. Later an elevator comes up from the ground.

They're getting ready to go through &quot;The Ark,&quot; which the game tells us is something that archeologists discovered left over from a previously unknown civilization and conveniently located only a few minutes from downtown Las Vegas. Why they never discovered it until whatever century this takes place in will remain a mystery for the rest of the film.

Especially when one of his teammates repeatedly insists on talking about banging her. First, of course, he asks if Karl has 'tapped that' and why he 'let that fine piece of ass get away' to which Karl responds, &quot;She's my sister.&quot; THEY'RE TWINS. IF I WERE KARL, I WOULD SLEEP WITH ONE EYE OPEN AROUND THE GUY WHO WANTS TO FUCK SOMEONE WHO LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE ME.

Needless to say, some prehistoric virus (that gives you a 24th chromosome that either makes you a Predator-esque monster with killin' on the brain or a superhuman with powers we're only told about but they're there, okay guys, just trust us) gets out and infects or eats everyone.

He gets shot with his own weapon and is bleeding, so naturally his sister, who has seen the havoc that his extra chromosome (apparently you can just INJECT chromosomes, by the way, and they'll alter your genes on the spot) has wrought and decides to inject her brother and maybe save his life. Reaper begs her not to, because he's done horrible things and will probably turn into a monster, too, but she's pretty confident and injects him because he's too weak to fight her, like some sort of futuristic interplanetary Doctor Kavorkian.

Apparently, it happens with alarming regularity, especially in movies you would not expect. (Chronicles of Riddick, what?)<br />"

And then we had to make airplane noises as we did the windmill things. We did a lap with our hands in the air. The Navy must think we're a bunch of weirdos. Then we played basketball. AWESOME. The stockiest kid got laid flat by our company CO, who is like a 5 ft older woman. 

Then we went to breakfast. Ugh, do not want Calc for 1.5 hrs."

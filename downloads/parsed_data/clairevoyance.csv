"event","it seems everything and it's permanence, or even its semi permanence....is falling through.
i'll go back to my new years resolution for 2007: ""i want to be happy this year""

let's see. FUCK YOU. new years resolution. the second i feel my eyes are above water level from paddling like hell to not slip into depression, another flood gate is opened. maybe not a rush of water, but a slow trickle right on my head. where i know the waters getting deeper & deeper, not to mention the water dripping on my head is flat out annoying.

i miss my family, but i'm staying here for my daughter.
i'd like my daughter to be with me, but i know i am in no mental state nor financial state to support her. the best thing is to let her father take care of her, it's it's driving me crazy.
i'm trying to get a better job, but i have to be patient to see how it pans out. i dont have the patience, simply because i don't have the time.
i want to get a bigger place to live so that i can do the things i NEED to do.
my back up job that will support me while this new job pans out just fell out from underneath me.

that's at LEAST $350 a week, *poof*... fucking gone.
now i will make the same in two weeks i'd have made in one night.

i'm becoming more & more dependent on friends. i can't do that. i know i have good friends, but seriously, i'm no mooch.you help me out, when you need help, i help you out. but i feel that people don't see that side of me.
a great friend of mine is totally helping me out right now, but she thinks i'm unappreciative sometimes... say, if i dont change the cat litter. understandable. but then i also feel like shes holding over my head and i cant fucking deal with it any more.

one more month and itll be all equal and i think my minds issues will be a bit more solved. maybe.....

ramble ramble.

"event","I have figured a few things out.
No one ever posts/reads on this website anymore.. but. oh well.

i've been having a hard time for a few months. things have been bad for me for a while now, but within the last few months everything has spiraled downward.
i deal with my stress and anxiety in ways i shouldn't.
i have confused the 'fake happy go lucky claire' that everyone knows with the 'real me'.
i don't mean to say i'm a fake person, because i'm not really.
but if you have just seen me or skimmed the surface of hanging out with me, you only know this 'fake claire'. the one who always seems so happy and having a blast no matter what.
well that's all bullshit, just so we are all clear here.

i used to write ALL of the time to get out any of my thoughts. and everything came out so well. now i have a hard time just writing a sentence, or saying how i feel. because i don't know. i don't know how i feel. which is ultimately even more confusing.

i am just a hollow body drifting around dealing with every day as it comes. i can't think about my future, i can't think about my past. if i don't just focus on today, my head spins out of control.

this post will have no real ending because i don't know how to deal with anything i just talked about, so how could i close it?"

"event","i am feeling bitter.
bitter towards this town and its citizens.
no one person or peoples in particular, just as an aspiring artist of sorts, there is nothing. there is a small art community here, but it is all singers, musicians, painters, and the like. and these things are very important in an art community, don't get me wrong.
it just seems like no matter how hard i try to get involved, or get people involved it falls to dust.
my ideas and dreams are stopped before they're even started. i can;t find any one or anything who can help me, direct me. i may just be needing to break away from what i know, and just DO it. but being more discouraged by a rejecting art community is very unnerving.
i want what i can do to matter. to be important.
i want to MAKE. i want to CREATE.
but suzy homemaker just isn't cutting it. mysewing machine has a thin film of dust. my knitting things haven't been touched in over a year. my mind for jewelry making is wearing thin.
and it is discouraging.
i need to be active in doing what i want to do, and it seems i have got myself into a rut of sorts. i need inspiration, and this city and mystate of mind has no room for inspiration.

seeing the people i saw tonight, having the discussions i've had, makes me relaize i'm not the only one....
worlds being put into perspective, not physical worlds, but the worlds in which we all think revolve around us.
i am in need.
just in need."

"event","i went to ihop tonight with my neighbor jeremy, his friend, and gemal, a bartender i work with.
gemal & i got to ihop before jeremy & co., so i called him to make sure he was on his way.
i put my phone in my purse, which was sitting on a window ledge outside of ihop. i'm standing a foot away from it.
a drunk middle age lady comes outside with a young guy friend. she went to my purse. i turn around because i heard the guy say, ""that's not your purse."" she saw me turn around and said to me ""hey sorry i was looking for a lighter."" this woman is obviously drunk, and just as a side note, has OBVIOUSLY seen some meth in her time. whatever. i saw her hands ON and IN my purse.
jeremy gets there, we are seated inside. i look for my phone to see what time it was....my phone's not in my purse. but  i just used it.... hello. the lady obviously took it, but i really have no proof other than i saw her hands in my purse.
we asked the people in the restaraunt if they'd seen it, no one had. i called it a million times with jeremys phone, it went staright to voice mail.....
jeremy talks to me about did i really see her in my purse. did i REALLY see her hands physically in my purse. yes. i did.
so he confronts the table. (there were 6 people total at the table) no one has it. obviously...except one thing. everyone pulls out their phones & says see here's our phones. except the drunk old lady. she said she didn't have a phone...
whatever. i'm in the process of letting it go, whatever.
the other table's food arrives. we were discussing on whether or not to call the police with our waitress. jeremy's detective skills served him a good purpose. ...when youre drunk at ihop, and your food arrives, what's the first thing you do?? YOU EAT YOUR FOOD. the drunk lady got up & went into the bathroom......hm. suspicious, yes?
so he tells me that when she comes out of the bathroom go through the trash in the bathroom.
lady comes out, sits down.
i go to the bathroom. i go through two small trash cans (ew i know)...nothing..
look under the sinks to find nothing.
pick up the lid to the toilet tank...
there it is.
the dumb bitch took the back off of my phone, took the battery out, and threw it in the tank of the freaking toilet.
so i come out of the bath room pissed off, yelling across the restaraunt, ""sooo...WHO WAS IN THE BATHROOM LAST?!?!?""
drunk lady - ""i was. what of it?"" (insert lots of attitude here.)
that's when jeremy gets up and is in her face yelling things like ""thats fucking right. we called you out bitch."" ""that's why i hate polk county"" ""your such a fucking liar""...etc. etc.
the lady is obviously guilty. she starts yelling she's going to call the police. sure lady call them. dumb ass....
well, i'll just say the table abruptly apologized to us (besides the drunk old lady) and gathered their things, got their food to go....

sigh...
long story short. i got my phone back.
AND IT STILL WORKS.

and that, friends, is why i hate polk county."

outside of my own small three part family, that is.
when we moved here, it was because boone's sister lived here with her husband & two kids. we'd have someone to be friends with, share holidays with, and hang out with.
they gave us a place to live for two weeks, helped us find out own apartment, helped us move. my sister in law helped me through my pregnancy, they helped us through our first marital struggles, and was there for us for our first holidays away from home. my brother in law helped my husband get a job, they were there when my child was born, they cared for that child while boone & i went on our first date in months. when i missed texas, my brother in law had a special bag of ""texas dirt"" he'd actually got out of his yard in texas before they made the trek to florida.
and now they're leaving. the house is packed. the trucks getting there at 7:30 am tomorrow. they're leaving tomorrow before noon. 
in thirteen hours, i will have no one.
there are so many emotions. grateful, sad, hopeful, upset, sad, jealous, happy (for them), and then nauseous. with all of this in one nervous system, it's hard to pick them all apart.

"event","so, claire what's been up??

nothing! i work, sleep, & make jewelry. oh yeah, and watch WAY too much degrassi for my own good.
i've been making a CRAP ton of jewelry, and no one is buying it. I haven't promoted it really, besides e-promoting. but that's not working too well for me. my website's in the works, and it's almost done. so that's cool.
i've been bartending, and i love it. i bust my ass, and it pays off well at the end of the night.
my sleep schedule is SO messed up. that's what i get for working nights, i guess.
i'm going to tampa on thursday to get my tattoo. i'm also going to vinyl fever, hopefully. and i'mthinking if going to the mall and stopping by forever21. stupid girly store, for those of you who don't know...but. they have the raddest stuff online, and i'm hoping to find the same rad-ness in the actual stores...

that's my life right now. kind of blah...just kickin' it with the kidmeister.

speaking of meisters...my friend tina was here last weekend. we had a blizzast. i love her to little teensie weensie pieces. &hearts;.
amy will be here on the 30th. YAY!!!

well..i'm off. peace!

""....we regret to inform you that ""levi's 503's"" do not come in longer inseam sizes at this time. We at Levi's try to stay current with customer needs....""

i just realized my shirt is inside out, and has been all day. awesome.

apparently we're going to start having a country night at lillian's. i was appaled. i ask ""good country??"", thus getting my boss and i on the subject of good country. i'm glad he likes wilco, and knows who whiskey town is. it made my day at a baby shower in a bar much happier.

but look out. i may be working at lil's more than one night a week.. maybe........

lame. but. i had to send my application in for america's next top model by thursday. yeah. i know. i'm going to win, you don't have to tell me.
my momma will be here on thursday, which rocks so much. you dont even know.
i've had to blow like half our tax return on my freaking car. the guy who'd fixing it called me and said, ""so, have you ever, i don't know...driven your car off a cliff before?""
WHAT?!?!   yeah. i got my tires aligned and theres one tire that just won't...align. so i have to get my FRAME worked on. (or sell my car with out a mention on the frame work needed thus seeking my gain and destroying thousands of lives!!!!!!!!!...hm.) so. thats that. and i took it in today to get my cv joints fixed. thats a pretty 500 bones. alignment was a little over 100. plus i have to get my ______ hose fixed so that my air conditioner will work.
i hate hondas as of right now. *gasp* yes. i remove myself from the ""i love my foreign car"" club.

i want a different foreign car.
and i'm making jewelry now...i'll post some stuff later.

"event","this is a boring, boring day.
i overslept this morning. which means half way through church here i come slinking in right down the middle aisle, and i sat like 3 rows from the front. good job being sneaky, claire.
then i ate lunch. best crab rangoon ever is found at peking house. (they filmed part of edward scissor hands there, you know...) and the screaming waitress. boy was she high strung.
then to home. to sleep til 4.
then movie time. we watched 40 year old virgin. it was super cheesy. i chuckled. but it was cheesy. i was just glad to see someone put the age of aquarius (let the sunshine in) on a soundtrack. best song.
then we went to matt & meghan's to watch desperate housewives and greys anatomy. its getting juicy, ladies & gents. juicy, i say!!!
and lost this week looks to be. amazing.
so, tomorrow, i have no plans. some one come play...ill be awake around 10. call me.
tuesday, moms group. karaoke @ lillian's. (duh) wednesday, nothing. then LOST! then thursday morning leah arrives!! yay!

friday we're going to see the west fifties. sounds rad.
saturday, mister adam is moving back. rock the f*ck on doooods.
sunday. i'm so making everyone go out....plus i have to hook up marissa and adam...UH HUH!

"event","last night was fun. besides my being pushed onto a set of stair. rock on, unkempt. hanging with the crew sooo rocks. besides the fact that my ex-manager is a *beep* - face. gah...
today was guinevere's 1st birthday party. how exxxxxciting! lots of rad kids showed up, and she got some rad gifts, too. lots of books (because shes a genious) and a gloworm, some clothes for this summer, and some diapers. yes diapers. and when she opened the diapers she yelled ""diaper!"" it was fabulous.
my little papoose (which is what i called her since she looked like a papoose all swaddled when she was a wee one)is growing up so fast. i hate it!! shrink, you! shrink!!

but, aside from being sad at my daughter's rite of passage (being getting a sugar high from cake and icing) to being a whole year old, and a very sore bum from my fall last night, today was a long eventful LONG fun day. did i mention that i love season one of lost?

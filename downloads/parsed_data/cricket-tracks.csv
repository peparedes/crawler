"event","<p>Yesterday, Saturday, my friend texted me and said he and his bf were going to a friend's place for dinner. He asked me if I wanted to join them. ... Actually, his exact words were, ""... care to be our +1?"" </p><p>That wording kind of struck a cord with me, because there is a part of me that would love for a couple to ask me to join them and become part of their family. </p><p>Also, yesterday was this couple's anniversary. So, for them to ask me to join them, for anything, on their special day was very nice, and it, admittedly, took me a bit by surprise.</p><p>Now my initial response to going to dinner at a stranger's house, even with my friends there, was, ""No way! That has social awkwardness written all over it.""<br>But then I had to look past the panic instinct response and think about it more logically. Here I had my friends, who I enjoy spending time with, asking me to join them. If I say no, especially when my reason is mostly based on fear of social awkwardness, then I really have no right complaining or being down because I'm alone. And I would have no right to be hoping for my bond with these friends to grow, even if just into a stronger, closer friendship. <br>So, I defied my fears and told my friend I would join them. </p><p>I went to my friends' place so we could carpool to the dinner. First we had to stop at Costco to pick up a dessert. May sound silly, but this was actually a treat for me. I don't have a membership, so I rarely go to Costco. And just having people to hang out with was such a nice deviation from the norm.  I kind of realized,  at that point, that I'm bored. My life has become, for the most part, boring. Granted, I'll gladly take boring over the numerous other worse options out there, but regardless , I have indeed become bored with my life. <br>Also, I've become tired and worn out from having to do everything for myself, by myself. Just having someone drive was,in and of itself, a special treat for me.</p><p>The dinner itself was fine. The hosts have a beautiful home. Their sitting room is as big as my whole apartment. And there was plenty of booze. I drank several types I had never drank before. I learned that I'm not too fond of brandy. It BURNS, Gabriel! It burns! But I did like ""the port"" okay. My favorite drink was, I don't know the name of all that was in it, but it was slightly fruity and looked like antifreeze. There was also champagne. It was my friends', and another couple's anniversary. Hence the champagne. </p><p>The people all seemed nice. Aside from myself and my friends, there were six other people. I knew one of them already, which in Humboldt, where all the gays know each other, at least indirectly, is to be expected. </p><p>The evening ended. My friends and I returned to their place, and from there I drove home. And that's the part that always punches me in the heart strings. I leave my friends. They always have each other, and I go home and return to being alone.</p><p>Now, there are some great things about being alone. Frankly, I love not having to share a bathroom with anyone. <br>But I do long, at the end of a nice evening such as last night, to have someone wrap my arms around. I really miss having someone close to care about me. </p><p>I sometimes ponder what it would be like if I was ""adopted"" into a relationship/family with a couple. And I seem to have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, what an awesome honor to be asked to share your life with these people. But then I wonder if I would ever feel... equal. It's not like three people can marry each other. Would I always feel like the odd man out? How does a person obtain a feeling of relationship security when they are in such a position? I don't know.</p><p>And frankly, I don't know if it's even a situation that I'll ever find myself facing, or even available to me. But still I wonder. </p><p><br></p>"

Tired of trying, just to get knocked back. <br>On a certain level, I feel overwhelmed. Like I have too many things to fix and I don't know how to fix them all.<br>Pride is this weekend, and I have very little interest in it. I feel like I'll just be disappointed. <br>I don't know why I'm in such a negative mood. <br>I know I'm sick of being alone.

My expectations, society's expectations.</p><p>I think part of my problem is I just need to have some fun. Aside from a few weeks ago when my friend gave me the best BJ I've ever had in my life, I've really not had much fun. I haven't been out of Humboldt in over a year. <br> I just feel anger, loneliness, depression and numbness all swirling around and building inside me. </p>"

"event","<p>It's been many moons since I've posted here. Partially because in June of 2012 my computer hard drive died. I haven't replaced it yet. I find it a pain in the ass to type anything of length on my phone.</p><p>What's been going on? Nutshell summary, lots of feeling like shit, emotionally. I went great periods of time without human interaction, aside from work. Too much isolation fucks a person up.<br>A couple months ago I let go of some crap that was bringing me down. With the exception of a couple people, I cut ties with the gaming group I used to hang out with. Don has basically stopped talking to me. Doesn't respond to my texts, and he kicked me off his FB friends list. Supposedly he and Kevin announced their engagement on Fourth of July. Not sure how that's going to work considering he never finalized our divorce.</p><p>Anyway, after I let go of the crap that was bringing me down, I met some new friends. One of them and his boyfriend have, I suppose you could say, become friend with benefits. I very much needed and enjoy the play time, though I'm starting to wonder if that's all I am. I could really use a friend. Someone to talk to. <br>I was feeling pretty good for a while, then over this past week, a ... darkness has come over me. I don't know why all of a sudden I'm feeling this way. But it feels horrible. I feel so incredibly alone. I feel like I'm being ripped apart. People telling me I'm a good guy, yet I'm still alone. I have no one nearby that loves me. Nobody to even go do things with. It seems like everyone else I know, those who were single, now have someone. But not me. All I can find are people who want to use me for one thing or another. Nobody is interested in a relationship. </p><p>When I'm with my friends with benefits, which is very rarely, I can be sitting on the couch holding one of them, and it feels so good just to have someone in my arms. But I always know that I'm just the odd man out. They always have each other, and I always go home alone.</p><p>And I'm sick of alone. It's caused such a vortex of anger and sadness inside of me that it is taking a physical toll on me. </p><p></p>"

"event","&nbsp;I'm considering making a rum carrot cake. &nbsp;All the recipes I find are for making it from scratch.&nbsp;I want to just use a mix, and add rum. So, should I replace some of the oil with the rum, or replace some of the water with rum, and how much should I use... and what kind of rum, I don't know much about it. Do I use the clear stuff or the yellow/gold stuff? &nbsp;
Also, if I use rum in the icing as well as the cake, would that be too much rum? Should I just stick to putting it in the cake?
Any advice?"

"event","&nbsp;The results of the presidential election restored my faith in my fellow Americans.&nbsp;
Too bad that victory was tainted by my fellow Californians ripping my rights away from me. &nbsp;My heart breaks thinking of all of my married brothers and sisters that are going to have their marriage made invalid. &nbsp;I'm actually ashamed to call myself a Californian today. &nbsp;
This cannot go unanswered. We cannot let ourselves be treated this way. I have no idea how to fix this situation, but I know we can't just shut up and accept it.


So what's next? How about next year we propose to make marriage just between a white man and a white woman. Or better yet, how about between only a white christian man and a white christian woman, that's what you &quot;yes&quot; people ultimately want isn't it?&nbsp;
Know this, all of you who voted yes on 8, this will come around and bite you in the ass. And when it does, I will have nothing to say to you except, &quot;you did it to yourself&quot;."

They hooked it to the scanner and got all kinds of crazy codes from it that they couldn't understand. So, not knowing how long the codes have been stored in there, the mechanic decided to clear all the codes and test again to see what pops up. He test drove the car and said the car fell flat on it's face. He didn't think he was going to make it back to the shop, it was running so poorly.&nbsp;<br />He cleared the stored codes and tested again. All kinds of crazy shit popped up again.

That's right, 60!



Favorite WoW moment in the last 10 levels.
I come across an Alliance Shaman outside a Horde camp. I watched as he carefully set up his totems just outside the aggro range of the guards. He then pulls one guard and starts carving him up. The guard is doing very little or no damage to the shaman. Apparently the shaman didn't realize I was there watching.
I snuck up behind the shaman and took out his totems. Then he started taking damage from the guard. I sent my cat to attack. Finally, the shaman realizes what's going on, turns around and comes after me. Between the guard and my cat beating on him, by the time he gets to me he only has 8% health left. I take a step back, and finish him off. That was fun.


On another note, I made my first trip to Outland. 
Fucking NUTS!

And one last note, I HATE SILITHIDS!"

"event","I am no longer a Pantheacon virgin. I was only there for a few hours, but I think some things are better experienced in small doses, at least for the first time. 

I drove down to San Jose, CA on Saturday. (I live in Eureka, CA). It was a seven hour drive.
I wanted to get there, find the hotel and get checked in to my room, and find the hotel where Pantheacon was at, all before dark. I did it. I arrived at Pantheacon just as it was getting dark.
I checked in and got my badge. Then I looked around a little bit to find out where I would be going for the presentation that night. I found that, then decided to go relax for a while. On my way out of Pantheacon, I stopped at a table and registered to vote. I'd been meaning to do that since I moved to Eureka, but never got around to it. Now it's done.
I had just missed dinner with Eddy and the group he had assembled, :0(
so I decided to stop some place to eat and take it back to my hotel room.

I ate and took a little nap. I got up and headed back to P-con at about 10pm. I saw Eddy and his BF and gots me some hugs. Yayyy! Then attended the Unnamed Path presentation.
It was an awesome turnout. 
I got to meet blktalon and steeleheart. 

The presentation and accompanying ritual were both great. 

I went back to my hotel room at about 1:30 am and crashed.

I left for home at 10AM the next morning.

Overall it was a great experience. Only a couple things I should probably have done differently.
I should have flown instead of drove. And I should have stayed for Sunday too. I was on such a tight schedule, I didn't get to experience much of P-Con, and I didn't get to hang out with Eddy or any of the guys. So, I know what to do differently next time."

"event","So, looks like I'm going to have to put getting that software I want on hold. Saturday morning the power went out. When it came back on, Don's computer would not start. I spent most of Saturday trying to fix that. I replaced the power supply, but that is not the problem. So, since his computer is about due for some major upgrades anyway, we looked into getting him a new one. As far as computers go, Humboldt, (or at least the Eureka/Arcata area), doesn't have shit. Pretty much Staples and Costco are the only two places that sell computers,and Costco only has full systems with the monitor and everything. He already has a nice monitor. Staples was out of two of the four models they carry. So, we ended up ordering something online. Needless to say, Don is going into computer withdraw mode. He doesn't know what to do with himself if he's not sitting at the computer. I figured this would be a great opportunity for us to spend some much needed time together. That's not working out quite as well as I'd hoped, but I'm still working on it.
Anyway, there goes the money I was going to use for the software, but once tax returns arrive, then I should be able to proceed with my plans. I'm just grateful we were able to pay for this new computer. 

As several of my Humboldt friends reported, it snowed here on Sunday. Unfortunately it didn't stick in the city. Too bad, it's been a long time since I've been in snow. I kinda miss it.

This morning I had a dream that I was walking through a parking lot, (I think I was in San Diego), and as I walked behind a SUV with its windows down, I noticed a man sitting in the back seat. Then I realized the guy looked a lot like my friend Todd. He saw me and got out of the SUV and walked towards me. He was wearing sunglasses so it took me a few seconds to verify it was him. Plus, he's currently in Iraq for 6 months. So, He was the last person I expected to see.
I gave him a big, tight hug and said, ""I hadn't planned on seeing you this soon.""
He said, ""Yeah, well, here I am. Go ahead, tear me up."" 
So I gave him another big hug complete with a two-handed ass squeeze. That got my motor running. I looked around remembering where I was, and I gave him a ""if only we weren't standing in a parking lot, the things I'd like to do"" look. He, apparently feeling the same way, said, ""I have tinted windows.""
That'll work! We both got in the SUV, folded down the back seat, and had some amazing sex.
I awoke from that dream well aware that I was getting proper blood flow to all the right places."

A couple months ago, a friend recommended the show Heroes. I figured I'd add the first disc to my NetFlix list and give it a shot.

I got the disc last month, but with school finals, and our trip to San Diego, I hadn't made time to watch it yet.
I watched the first episode last night. I then had to immediately watch the second episode.
That's all it took. I'm hooked. I'm going to try to get Don to watch. I think he'd like it too.

And the good part is that, being isolated from tv land, I have very little information about the show so I have no idea what will happen. Every revelation will be a surprise to me."

Only a few minor disappointments. The coffee shop I was looking forward to going to is now a Starbucks, very sad. Also, I took my camera, and for one reason or another, I didn't take one damn picture. 

It was nice seeing my friends again. It had been two and a half years since I saw them last. I realized, well actually I already knew this, but I realized it continues to be true that I have some amazing friends. They are all very smart and they are experiencing much success right now. I'm very happy for them. I only wish I could see them more often.

The highlights of my vacation included seeing my friend Todd. He leaves for Iraq in a week or so. I'm so glad I got to see him before he left.
Also, I finally got to meet Eddy in person. That was a wonderful treat. I wish I had gotten a picture of us together. My friends here in Humboldt aren't going to believe me when I tell them I had lunch with Dec 07 Mr. Chunk. :0)

 Well, it's good to be sleeping in my own bed again. For the first few nights while I was away, I didn't sleep very well.
Many thanks to Mike for watching my critters while I was away. Thanks to Eddy for driving all that way to see me, and for the  ""fuck me"" soap.(I love it!) 
Thanks to the cute bartender at Martinis Above Fourth for , well.. for the drinks and the eye candy. Thanks to Ben & Brett for hosting us.

"event","Well, my grades are in for the final exams that I took Wednesday.
I got 99 out of 100 on my Database final. Which will give me an 'A' for the class.

I got 100% on my programming (Java) final. That gives me an 'A' in that class as well.

Yay me!

Okay, Santa, I lived up to my end of the bargain and passed all my classes with an 'A'. Now you have to bring me Colton Ford for Christmas. A deal's a deal."

"event","Last few weeks of the semester is crazy-busy time.
I have this week, next week and then my finals are the following week on Wednesday.

So, I have one Java assignment left. (Due next Wed). One database assignment left, (Due whenever I get it done.) And my database project, (Due Monday).

I worked on my previous Java assignment for 4 hours on Friday and 4 hours on Saturday. I was building (programming) a calculator. (Not as easy as it may sound.) However, I did finish it and feel pretty good about it. (We had access to the solution, but I did it on my own.)


Other school news: There are two more classes I need to take for my degree. Neither of them are being offered. But both are being substituted with other classes. One, (the capstone course substitution) I'll take in the spring. 
The class is a digital media capstone course, but it is being adapted for programming, and business technology students as well. The course is basically to crease a video game. The whole process. The class will be divided into groups and each group will have students from each of the different degree areas,(programming, digital media, and business tech.)  Though my degree is computer programming, I've also had digital media and now also a touch of business tech. too. One of my instructors suggested I would be a good candidate for team leader.  Hmm. 

The other class I need is being substituted with a class I already took. I turned in the substitution paperwork yesterday.

So, it looks like I will have this degree in May. Now, what the hell am I gonna do with it? I guess that's something I need to figure out over the next several months."

"event","Nothing too exciting going on . I've been spending most of my spare time on either homework or WoW.
I think I may be playing too much WoW. Two nights in a row I had dreams about it.
I don't remember details, but the first night I remember being stuck in a chain quest. (That's where one quest leads right into another).
The second night, again I don't remember much about it, but I do recall I had a spell called Eternal Erection. I cast the spell and I had an instant, steel-hard erection. Then I woke up and I really did have an erection.


The building I live in has turned into a day-care center. Well, not really, but it seems that way. Two new neighbors have children. Add them to the hyper beast of a child that lives above me and it sounds like a damn Barney the Dinosaur concert. This makes it more difficult to find some peace and quite to meditate and journey.
Maybe if I hand out mini bottles of scotch for Halloween instead of candy the kids will drink it and pass out. Then I can meditate while they're sleeping."

I see the images and I read the statistics and wish there was something I could do make it all better, but that's a bit beyond my power. 
What I can do is be thankful for what I have. And I am.
I'm thankful that I woke up this morning in my own bed, with a roof over my head, food in my kitchen, and my own bathroom to use. I'm thankful for my partner and getting to kiss him goodbye before he left for work this morning.

So, this morning I'm just taking a moment to just stop and think about all the things I have in my life that I normally don't think about, and often take for granted. And I'm taking a moment to be thankful and appreciate what I have."

"event","Icon explanations

As part of some meme fun, I'm explaining some of my icons. The seven selected by <lj user=""revhyperion"">  are as follows.

Trooper:
I don't remember where I found this, but as a Star Wars fan I just had to get it.  I see it as a happy, celebratory icon, but some see his thrusting as a more sexual expression. If I can contribute to any men-in-uniform fetishes anybody might have, then all the better.

Joy:
In one of the unnamed path podcast, Hyperion is describing the logical thought process of the conscious self, compared to the logic of the higher self. In doing so, he uses an analogy of apples in a basket. 
He says, ""It's more like, one plus one equals two, kind of logic. Where you just put two apples together in a basket and you have two apples. It's very simple. It's not like, 'If you put two apples in a basket what do you have? You have joy.' ""
And with the way he says it... I laughed my ass off. I had to make this icon to commemorate the event.

Ralph:
He is my favorite Simpsons character. I love quoting him. He makes me laugh so much. 

Lion:
Cause I'm a Leo, baby! Hear me roar! Ok, it's more like a mew, but I'm workin' on it.

Me in chains:
A few months ago I had a rare moment where I actually felt attractive. I took pictures. Nuff said.:0)

Dog:
I originally started this journal to keep track of spiritual progress. This icon just seemed appropriate. It's kinda shamanicy. And, yes, in my journal, shamanicy is a word.

Obi-wan:
The image is from one of the episodes of the Star Wars Clone Wars cartoon series. In this scene, Obi-wan and Anakin had been stuck in a bunker for quite some time. It was raining and no matter where in the makeshift bunker Obi-wan would stand he would get dripped on. Hence the frustrated look on his face."

Rainy mornings are for sleeping, not for going to class.




WoW update:
I got a character, Lushra, to level ten! Actually, she's level 12 now, but 10 was a milestone. She went to Brewfest and got drunk to celebrate.
She also went into the big city of Orgrimmar for the first time. It was like going into a real life city. Big and crowded. Easy to get lost in. I think I was about the lowest level character there. Now I know what all the high level characters do. They just hang out in the city telling stories. 


Second Life update: 
My character (Orin) went to a party at someones beach house. Lots of half-to-mostly naked gay guys (avatars) there. Dancing, great music, a bit of kinky chatting, lots of fun. 

Real life update:

"event","Sunday, a very unique event happened. Don went to Pride.
For as long as I've known him, Don has not been a very big fan of gay pride celebrations. His reasons being that they are too commercial, and that the mainstream media reports a skewed perspective of the events, usually pictures/video of the drag queens or whatever else that stands out and will get peoples attention.

To a great degree, I agree with Don's thoughts on this. And I've examined both sides of those sentiments. On the one hand I do think Pride is becoming more about the image, and less about the meaning.  On the other hand, I also feel it's important for GLBT people to make an appearance and support these events. I feel it's important to tell those who would prefer to condemn us, lock us away, or just ignore us, that we are not going away. We will not turn around and go back to our closets to hide. 

The local pride celebration was held on Sunday. It is purposely scheduled in September because a generous portion of the town's population consist of students from HSU. This way, the students can participate.
Sunday was also Don's birthday. I didn't expect him to want to go, (he never has for as long as I've know him,) so I was going to meet up with a friend and he and I would go. 

I told Don about what I had read about the pride celebration here. The booths were all non-profit organizations, and they were even having a bounce house for the kids. 

Don agreed to go on the condition that we have breakfast at one of his favorite restaurants, which is just a block off the parade route. Since it was his birthday, I agreed and we went.

If you've ever seen a pride celebration in a big city, you know it can be quite a huge event. Parades that last for hours. Vendors everywhere. Dance floors. Lines to get into the festival. All kinds of craziness.
None of that here.
The parade took less than 15 minutes to go by. There were maybe 20 booths set up with local vendors selling handmade crafts or food. And there was a stage area for music performances. It was about as down-home and simplified as it could be. And for a small town, there was a pretty generous turnout, especially considering it was raining a bit.

We all had a great time. I enjoyed it because I could tell these people weren't there just to put on a show, they were there because they really did have pride.



On another note. I had my first test in Java class today. I think I did well."

"event","A couple weeks ago I had a dream where I was at a house which seemed to belong to someone in my family. The house had a large yard and no fence. I was inside talking to my mother. She had to go somewhere, so she got on her bike and left. I looked out the window and watched her riding away. I noticed she was looking at something. It was the neighbor's car. They had parked and not set the brake, and the car was slowly building up speed as it rolled across our yard and curved towards the side of the house .... where my car was parked. I thought, ""Shit! it's going to smash into my car!"" I hurried outside and sure enough, the whole back end of my car was smashed in. I woke up and was relieved to realize my car had not been smashed.
The significant part of the dream was my mother. It used to be that every time I had a dream with her in it, she was a bitch, very mean. Then a couple months ago I worked with the dark goddess and she helped me deal with issues I had with my mother. Since then my mother has not been a bitch or even mean at all. 


A couple nights ago, I had a dream where I was at a large department store. It was the late 1940s or early 50's. Funny thing is the dream was in black and white. Hehehe.
So this store had a small diner inside of it. I was with a fairly large group of people who had gathered at the store diner to get some of the free pastries they were passing out. This was a big deal. There were no computers, and televisions were only for the wealthy people, so it was a popular activity to go to the department store on a certain day of the week and get a free pastry. Many people went just for the social gathering and didn't even take the pastries.
Now, I'm standing in line, waiting for them to bring out the pastries. I hear an announcement over the store's intercom. A male voice, sounding distinctly like a radio announcer from the time, welcomes everyone to the store and says, "" If you're here to try a slice of our hot, delicious pizza, you'll be happy to know we now serve it on a warm, oiled plate!"" Apparently serving food on warmed, oiled plates was a fad going on at this time. 
Then two women came out from the back room of the diner. They were dressed much like Lucy (from I Love Lucy when she was boxing chocolates) with the aprons and hats. They each had hold of one end of a white towel that they stretched between them and carried a stack of, what looked like, powdered donuts. They began passing them out. It was very civil. No pushing, no shoving. Just a friendly social gathering with free pastries. Everyone stayed there for a while just chatting and laughing and enjoying their free baked yummies. The store employees even had a good time. The store owners didn't give crap if these people were buying anything or not. It was all about bonding with the community.
I awoke with a bit of a warm-fuzzy feeling.... and a craving for pizza and donuts."

Seven Random Things
 List seven habits/quirks/facts about yourself.

1) I was a virgin until I was 28.

2) I was born a month premature, on Friday the thirteenth, and that morning there were 5 twisters spotted in the town I was born in. I was delivered c-section, and was blue around the mouth and almost didn't make it. A bit of a dramatic birth, but I'm a Leo, and sometimes in order to get all the attention we desire we Leos have to resort to dramatic measures. :0P

3) When I was about 4 years old, I fell face first into a bar-b-que filled with lit coals. I still remember it. I was more afraid of my parents' punishment, (they told me not to rock in the lawn chair because it could collapse, and I did it anyway,) than I was of getting hurt in the fire.

4) I've been shit on by birds twice. I only deserved it once.

5) My favorite birthday cake ever was not a cake but a bumble berry pie.

6) Through accurate placement of the shower spray, I can get off without stroking myself.

7) I haven't touched a man's (or any) nipple in over 6 years. (My partner hates having his nipples touched.)"

"event","Okay, <lj user=""revhyperion""> gave me a letter so, here we go.

Brought to you by the letter ""L""
10 words beginning with the letter ""L""


Leon - My middle name. Also my father's middle name, my grand father's middle name, my great grandfather's middle name, and my great-great grandfather's first name. Spelled backwards it's Noel.

Labia - Part of the female anatomy. If I ever got into SM, this would be the safe word because, with all due respect to women, there is no way I could keep it up after thinking about that.

Lipo - Short for Liposuction. Sucking fat out of your body through a tube. So many gay men say they need it, so very, very, few of them actually do. 

Lysol - Disinfectant/germ killer. Because the toilet seat should not have it's own ecosystem.

Lick - Rubbing your tongue across something. Licking is very important for eating and also an important part of great sex.

Liquor - Stress release in a bottle .... or box.

Laser - An intensely focused beam of light. Part of one of my favorite sayings. ""That boy is laser straight.""

Leather - I love the smell of leather, especially when mixed with testosterony man musk. Mmmmmm, I smell SEX!

Libido - Drive, energy, sexual desire. Mine likes to hibernate like a bear. It takes an extraordinary day or a really tasty piece of meat to wake it up.

Laundry - What I'm going to do now."

So, I'm net exploring and I come across this discovery at 
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Troy/2774/mythgods.html

""Greek and Roman Mythological Gods
Greek Name: Phosphor
Roman/Latin Name: Lucifer
Description: Light-bearer, Star that brings in the day""

Upon more exploration I discovered this, which I found to be an enlightening and entertaining read.  

http://www.lds-mormon.com/lucifer.shtml

I'm irritated at the obvious bastardization, yet tickled to have this nugget of knowledge to add to my arsenal.


I had my first Pilates class today. (Second class, really, but first class we actually did something.) We touched ourselves and focused on tuning in to our pelvises. Teacher told me to feel my prostate. It sounds suggestive, but really it isn't.  I like having a class where I can be barefoot."

A couple weeks ago it was , ""Read a book, read a book read a mother***kin book..""

Hehehe, oh well, I guess there are worse ways to go insane.

Speaking of insane, today, (Sunday) is my last day of summer break. I go back to class tomorrow. It has been nice having the time off. It was the first summer I haven't had work or school in about 18 years. 

I'm pondering what to do with my journals. I have Myspace, and two Live Journals.  I just won't have the time to update them all as often as I like. Myspace is mostly just for quick hellos and comments to friends. But I'm debating whether to eliminate one of my LJs. I created this one with the purpose of keeping track of my spiritual progress, but I've ended up discussing everything in this one.
There's also the issue of migrating friends from one to the other. The friends on the other account are out of the loop as far as my recent (last 6 months) spirituality developments go. Hmmm, decisions, decisions.

Well, time to go enjoy my last day of summer break."

<lj-cut text=""Read more"">

*The first time a cute guy told me he thought I was cute. (Or anytime a cute guy tells me he thinks I'm cute.)
*My first gay kiss.
*My first real make out session with a guy where I felt totally comfortable and was completely into it.
*Every time I think of my jaw being sore for three days because of previously mentioned make out session.
*The first time I got fucked and was able to ""take it all"". I was so proud of myself!
*The first time I got plowed twice in a row. 
*The first time I was in a house with just other gay men. It was the first time I really felt happy and comfortable being gay.
*My first gay club, which was also the first time I ever danced in a club.
*The time Don sneezed and blew carrot all over himself. LOL!
*Working at Disneyland Lego store.
*Standing in front of a waterfall and feeling it's energy wash over me.
*Being naked in an outdoor hot tub with a drink in my hand and a great view to look at.
*Getting into bed when it has fresh sheets.
*My mom getting to meet Don and seeing me happy with him before she died.
*My dad accepting Don. 
*Pumpkin pie ice cream.
*Pumpkin pie cheesecake.
*The feeling I got as a child when I got a new Star Wars toy.
*Being a child and not worrying about anything except what toy I would play with next.
*When I first heard Margaret Cho. Especially impersonating her mother, ""The gays always wanting the ass. All the time wanting the ass. You have to have ass in moderation .... or it's not special.""
*Colton Ford.
*Colton Ford dancing.
*Colton Ford fucking.
*Seeing my friends in a moment of extraordinary happiness.

*Finding out, through my spiritual path, just how special I really am.
*Reading comments in my journals.
*When I was a child and my grandparents would visit.
*The time my grandfather got frustrated with my grandmother and told her to ""go douche with a garden hose"". It wasn't as funny then, especially to grandma, but now, looking back on it, it's hilarious.
*This is a strange one, but it's the strongest memory I have of my paternal grandfather, who died when I was about 12. We were standing in the back yard and he says to me, ""Why don't you get a stick and a bucket and pick up some of this dog crap?"" HAHAHAHA! Awww, good times. Hehe.
*A cat enjoying catnip.
*As a child, sleeping in back of the station wagon on family vacations.
*Drive-in movies.
*How my mom would get freaked out when I would open my mouth when it was full of pop-rocks. (These weren't the tame ones they have today. When they first came out they were more like small pebbles, and it felt like your teeth were chipping and pieces of your tongue were getting blown off ... they were great!)
*When red M&Ms came back.
*My 18th (and only) birthday party.
*When I was a child, mom and I would go to the grocery store and the butcher would give me a free hot dog.
*Helping dad put up Christmas lights, even though I normally wasn't much help.
*The look on my co-worker's faces when I went to work with bleached blond hair. (This earned me the nickname ""Backstreet"".)
*Making my boyfriend Christmas cookies in the shape of my penis. I also made anatomically correct gingerbread men.
*Every time my partner comes home from work and tells me he's getting a raise.
*My Dad driving me to San Francisco, (it took all night to get there), just so I could see a Star Wars exhibit at a museum there. Then, immediately after, he tanked up on coffee and drove us back home.
*My great friends, and their crazy, wonderful lives.

"event","This weekend I went to a gay club. Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. There were hot guys dancing, bumpin' music, and maybe a little flirting going on. Only I wasn't actually at a club. My avatar was. 
I discovered the online game, Second Life. Actually, I hesitate to call it a game because it's really much more than that. (Harvard law school is actually using Second life for it's distance learning classes.)
I decided to give Second life a try back in April, but  my computer couldn't handle it. Now I have a new computer so I tried it again. It takes a little while to get used to how things work and where things are,  but it can be really fun.
Basically, you create your character, called an avatar, and you navigate around doing, well, pretty much whatever you want to do. 
I met a guy, Dean,  friday night who has been really nice and helped me out quite a bit. He took me to a gay club where we could chat, listen to music and even dance.

Here's Dean and Orin, (I'm Orin, in the back wearing the tail), dancing.

Dean gave me the thong I'm wearing. Wasn't that nice?

I went back again Saturday night. Dean and I were the only ones there. Guess everyone was out at real clubs. Later on that night I got lost in a sex club. It's kind of built like a maze, and I was so distracted by the pics on the walls I failed to remember how to get out. No problem though. I teleported out.
Sunday I went shopping. There is lots and lots of stuff to buy, but I'm doing just fine with the freebies I find.

So here's what I wore the next night to the club. I have blue shoes that sparkle. They're great. Sunday night when I was at the club there was a DJ. He had fun heckling his straight friend who was just standing on the dance floor and not dancing.

So, dad and I went on a train ""excursion"". It wasn't exactly what I had expected, but it was pretty nice. 

This is the train I was on.

How is this possible? Well we had to go up and down a canyon. Going up the canyon the engine pulled us. When we headed back, they unhooked the engine and moved it to the other end of the train, attached to the caboose, to act as our brake lowering us down the canyon.

Trip to Oregon: Day 1. Friday, July 21.
I left home at 10:30 AM and arrived at my dad's house in Northern Oregon at 9:00PM that night.
In Oregon, they pump your gas for you. When I stopped in Salem, OR, a hottie filled my tank for me. 


Trip to Oregon: Day 2. Saturday, July 22.
Two years ago, when I last visited my dad, one of the rolls of film full of pics from the trip was ruined and I lost some pretty good pics. This time I had a digital camera. Saturday, Dad took me to retake some of pics that I lost on the last trip.

This was at a park where Dad and I got attacked by mosquitoes. Luckily we had the repellent with us.

Even though I left the key, Don didn't get the mail while I was gone, so I have a stack of mail to go through. The laundry needs to be washed. The fridge is empty. I have bills I need to pay.
Then there is the money issue. To put it in a nutshell, while I was gone, Don used his unused sick pay and $475 from our account to buy us a laptop. Which is supposed to be a birthday present for the both of us.  I have mixed feeling on this.

So, until next week, I leave you with this.

"event","A very dull and boring weekend. Dull and boring has become the theme of the summer. Let me just say that I do prefer dull and boring over horrible and painful.
However, that said, I need to put an end to dull and boring before it depresses me into silent insanity.

My dad, who I haven't seen in two years, was supposed to come visit me last week. 
Turned out he couldn't make it. So, there is a proposed trip to go to Oregon to visit him in the works. I also want to go to southern california. 

Not sure what's going to work out though.

I will go somewhere and do something this summer even if I have to stand on the side of the road wearing nothing but a banana peel to hitch a ride.
I'm joking, of course. That's not safe.   You have NO idea where that banana has been.

Meanwhile, in an attempt to keep my spirits up, I decided to post some of my favorite youtube clips.

"event","I have now noticed my arms and chest are getting bigger. Yeaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyy progress! I'm handling the cardio better too. 


Last week I went to Target to get body wash. I like the stuff that says ""for men"". It makes me feel special.  ""Look! They made it just for me!"" 
So, I find one that looks and smells appealing. It's a Target brand version of an Axe product. I look on the back and it has a little slogan, some  ""Wear this and attract lots of women"" kind of thing. Okay, I'm not naive enough to think that just because I use this product women are going to flock to me. Nor do I really want them to. 
I did however, find myself a bit offended. This product was made for men. I have no problem with that. I do have a problem with people/companies/governments/ whatever, assuming that they know what all men want.

I looked at many of the Axe brand products and they all had the same ""Attract women"" slogan on them. I don't use Axe products anyway, I think they are too expensive, also, there must be a way to make yourself smell like you want  to smell without filling the landfills with up-teen million spray cans.
I didn't buy the Target brand either. 

I came home and did some looking around the AXE website. Some of their commercials I find amusing. I'm not against their current marketing. Straight men attracting women. I'm just upset that, from what I could see,  it stops there. 
I clicked on the ""contact us"" link. and left them the following message.
******
""comments: 
Your products seem to be popular. I'm curious why you only
seem to be targeting such a small demographic. (Straight men.)

It would seem wise to appeal to a larger variety of people. Just a small
change in the advertising/marketing would appeal to the gay demographic.
Also, I'm betting a women's line of axe products would be popular too.
Just a couple of suggestions. Yes, I know you have a team, or perhaps
hire a company, to come up with suggestions, but sometimes the best
suggestions come from the consumer.
Thank You for your time.

Nothing irate. Just an honest inquiry.
Honestly I didn't expect a response.

Well today I got one.

""Hi Scott,

Thank you for contacting us regarding your ideas and suggestions
regarding advertising of the AXE product line in North America.

Our company receives a number of suggestions and requests having to do
with various aspects of our business.  These ideas frequently duplicate
material for which we may have already be familiar. In view of this, and
as you may be aware, it has become necessary to adopt a strict policy of
declining all ideas, suggestions and related materials submitted by
those outside our organization.

We regret that such a policy is necessary, particularly since we
recognize that your offer to was made in the spirit of goodwill.

Although we cannot assist you, we appreciate your interest.

Thank you,
Your friends at AXE

khw
****


First of all, grammar, people, GRAMMAR! You are representing a company. Phrases like,  ""... for which we may have already be familiar."" and  "" ... that your offer to was made in ... "" make me doubt the capability of this company. 

So, this was either a nice, ""Screw you! We don't care what you think, we do what we want, "" or maybe there are in fact changes taking place that I just don't know about.
Maybe they give a damn, maybe they don't.

Then I wonder if I'm just over-reacting, and that this shouldn't upset me. 
But I think of the people who are using these products. I have a friend who has a brother in high school. He mentioned that so much of this stuff is sprayed in the boy's locker room that you can hardly breathe. How are these guys affected by this advertising? Yes, it's just one little slogan on a product. But it's one of many ways society is telling us who and what we should be. To whatever degree, it's defining our masculinity for us.

Am I a hypocrite for liking products that say ""for men"" on them.  By doing this are they telling me what a man should like?  I know that if a product smells like shit, or it doesn't work, I'm not going to buy it reqardless of what it says on it. 

 I think the thing that really bugged me was that it would have been so easy for Axe to have tweaked their slogan just a little and appeal to more people. Something like, ""Axe, Attract your desire.""  It's simple. It still plays into the cheesy gimmick that people will flock to you because of your body spray/wash, whatever.

Well, I'm not going to spend all day ripping this issue apart. 


I'm going to go admire my ever-improving chest and arms. Heheheheheh."

"event","Don and I decided to go on a little trip Sunday. Don's a big fan of straw-bale houses.  There is a coffee shop made out of straw bale about an hour and a half drive from here that we wanted to check out. 

This is it here.
http://www.strawhousecoffee.com/pages/about_us.html

So we drove out there. It was hot, but the place is right next to a river with a GREAT view. Lush forest all around. Plus the patio had misters to cool people off.

Here are a few pics I took there. Unfortunately, the sun was shining right at me, and I couldn't see the screen on the camera, so the pics aren't top notch, but you get the idea.

First objective: go in and get something cold to drink.

"event","As the new millennium arrived, I began a new life.  I was determined to deal with the feelings I had for men. I figured I'd start by talking to a few gay people. I got an account on Planet Out. There I saw the profile for a guy,  Don, who was in a relationship, but was looking to make new friends. He had listed that he had had trouble with the ""coming out experience"", and knew it could be difficult. He welcomed anyone who was having trouble with coming out to send him a message and he'd help the best he could. I sent Don a message basically saying I had feelings for guys, but didn't fit the gay stereotype, so I wasn't sure if I was gay or not.  He responded with what basically amounted to a confirmation that I was indeed gay. I think, really, I just needed to hear it from somebody else. But I needed to hear it in an accepting tone. 
So, there I had it. I was gay. No more denying it to myself. I continued to talk to different guys online.  Of course, living in the desert, I didn't know how the hell I was ever going to meet any of them. Most seemed to live in the cities, LA or San Diego.
Well, I began having regular chats with a guy named Manuel. He seemed like a pretty nice guy,  and we seemed to be getting along pretty well. One day he invited me to come see him. He said that he had a gift for me. He didn't live in the desert, but he was less than an hour away, so I decided to go meet him. This was VERY unlike me. I was not good at meeting new people. But we had talked enough that I felt reasonably comfortable meeting him.

June 2, 2000
That afternoon I headed over to meet Manuel. He was living in his grandmother's trailer in a trailer park. She was in an assisted living home, so he was taking care of the trailer for her. Now, this wasn't one of those trashy trailer parks, I guess it wasn't actually trailers. I believe mobile home park might be a better phrase for it. It was a pretty nice place. Lots of older, retirees living there. I found it a bit unnerving because the cemetery was right next door. 
Anyway, I pulled up in front of his place and he was washing his jeep. I got out and said hi, shook his hand. I stood on the back porch and watched him finish washing his jeep.  I thought, ""He's pretty cute. Nice ass! I want to squeeze it.""
He finished up and showed me inside. He lived there with a roommate, but she was gone for a couple days. It was a nice place. I sat on the couch. He sat next to me and we talked some. I noticed there was no TV in the living room. That was strange to me. I was wearing shorts and he mentioned he liked my legs. He asked me if I was hungry and I told him I was. So we drove to the grocery store and picked up a few things. We came back and he made me spaghetti. I was impressed. I thought, ""A guy actually made me dinner. I could get used to this.""

The following is behind a cut because it is a bit explicit and talks about sex. So, if you think Scott + Sex = Ewwww. Then don't read this part.
Everyone else, click to read.

<lj-cut text=""Read more"">

After we ate he showed me his room, which was rather small. ""Ah-ha, there's the TV!"" He had a california king size bed and it took up most of the room. Conveniently, that was the only place in the room to sit. I sat down and he asked me if I wanted to watch some of his porn videos. I had only seen gay sex pictures. I hadn't ever seen any gay sex videos, so I agreed. So, I tried to make myself comfortable as he proceeded to show me some of his favorite scenes. I admit it was a bit of sensory overload. One scene involved a very close-up shot of a HUGE cock plowing its way into a pin hole of an ass. Whoa!
Then Manual turned the porn off and began rubbing my leg. His hand went further and further up my shorts until he was rubbing my dick. I was pretty nervous and hence wasn't immediately achieving the rock-hard fullness I knew I could achieve.
He began taking off my shorts. Wow, things were going kinda fast. I told him. ""Hey."" I pointed to my lips, ""Why don't you start up here and work your way down?"" He smiled and moved up so he was eye-level with me. Then he kissed me.
""My first man-kiss! YES!""
He kissed me some more. I was used to kissing a girl, so I sort of  kissed like a Puritan. Lightly with lips closed. He said the way I kissed was cute.
He unbuttoned my shirt and began working his way  down my chest, over my stomach and ended up back at my dick. He began sucking and kissing it. This was a realm of sensation I never dreamed could exist. I moaned as he sucked harder and faster. It wasn't long before I knew I was going to come. I didn't really know the protocol for this, but I figured I'd better tell him.
""Dude, I'm gonna blow!"" He barely had time to pull his head away before I exploded into orgasmic bliss.
He grabbed a shirt from beside the bed and cleaned me up. He said, ""That was the gift I wanted to give you.""
Then he plopped down beside me and began jacking off. I watched for a while then I couldn't resist any more. I grabbed his dick and stroked it for him. ""Wow, I'm touching another guy's dick!"" I stroked it until he shot his load. He loved it.
He cleaned himself off and grabbed me and pulled me on top of him. He kissed me and held me and told me he loved what we just did. He said he was still horny and he wanted to go further with me but that he didn't think that would be a good idea just yet. 
He invited me to spend the night. I told him I had better get home. As he walked me out, I grabbed his ass. 
I'm not sure how I made it home alive, because my mind was spinning and certainly not on my driving.

We saw each other several more times over the next several weeks. During this time I made great progress in my gay training. I learned I actually do like kissing with tongue. I like hot, deep, rough, stubble-on-stubble kisses. After this lesson, my tongue and jaw were sore for three days. 
I learned how to suck dick.
It took a while, two or three sessions, but I learned how to be a bottom. (I didn't end up a 30-year-old-virgin, like I thought I would be, after all.) 
I also learned how to be a top. This was a lesson he kinda paid for. It was before my ""bottom lessons"" so I really didn't understand what it felt like to take it. I'm afraid my ability to distinguish ""I like it,"" moans from ""Damn that hurts,"" moans wasn't that great. We eventually got the desired effect, but he told me afterwords, ""That was great, but the next time you shove that donkey dick up my ass, GO SLOW! ""
</lj-cut>

In July Manuel took me to Mexico. This was really cool of him because I had very little money. He paid for everything. We went to a place a bit north of Acapulco called Ixtapa . It was beautiful. The hotel was right on the beach. The pool had a bar in it. (BEST IDEA EVER!)
In Mexico I impressed my ""teacher"" with my ability to 69. I also had my first shower sex. I think he may have left finger marks in the shower head, he was griping it so hard.
During this time I was still chatting with Don once in a while. I remember one day while I was writing him an email, I thought to myself, ""Wouldn't it be funny if some day I ended up with Don instead of Manuel. Little did I know.
By August, things had started going crazy in Manuel's life. His grandmother's health was failing. There was other family drama as well.  He wasn't out, so we pretty much had to keep our relationship a secret. Over the next six months, we saw each other less and less. 
In December, I decided to come out to my mother. My family was the type that very rarely ever had any deep discussions. We didn't usually talk about our feelings much. That day, I actually had a nice, fairly deep discussion with my mother. She was okay with me being gay. Her only concern was that I would get AIDS. I assured her that just being gay didn't automatically mean you were going to get AIDS.
So, to a degree, I was out. But at work I played the game of changing pronouns and names when discussing my relationship with Manuel. They made assumptions that I  was seeing a woman, and I didn't correct them.

By the beginning of 2001 Manuel and I barely saw each other. In February, Don invited me to come to a little  party he and his roommate were having. Don lived in a different part of the desert with two gay room mates. (At this point he was no longer in a relationship.)
I agreed to come. I showed up and Don answered the door. As he lead me inside I noticed he had a really nice ass. (I still think he does.) He introduced me to his roommate Todd. (His other room mate was out of town). Todd was very cute. Don also introduced me to two of their friends that were there. 
This was one of the most amazing nights of my life. I was in a house with four cute gay guys. There were gay magazines on the coffee table. I didn't even know they made gay magazines, aside from porn.
It was a fun evening of food, drinks and a trip to the local bar for karaoke. I developed an instant crush on Todd and spent most of the night staring at him.
That night, Don's friends slept in Todd's room, Don went to his room. Todd and I slept in the living room. He was very sweet and gave me the couch and the best sleeping bag. He slept on the floor. I would have easily given up the couch in order to share a sleeping bag with him, but I wasn't quite brave enough to propose that.

Over the next month, Manuel and I decided to call it quits, and I spent a few nights in Todd's bed. No, not just nights, UNFORGETTABLE NIGHTS!  Once again, my tongue and jaw were sore for days. We weren't becoming boyfriends, but I enjoyed spending time with him. Todd went out of town for a couple weeks, but I continued to go to the house to visit Don. We spent some time together and developed feelings for each other. The night Todd came back, Don and I had decided to be a couple. This was great because I wanted a boyfriend to love. But this was also disappointing because I cared for Todd too. It's not like we were boyfriends, I would have been up for that, but he really didn't seem like he was looking for any kind of long term relationship.  I felt bad that I wouldn't be sleeping in Todd's bed anymore.  I didn't want Todd to feel like I was using him. Yes, I LOVED our man-on-man action, but I cared for him as a person too. 
Todd and I continued to be friends. And yes, even today, I still have a crush on that sweet, sexy bastard.


So, Don came to live with me. I hadn't come out to my father, but at this point I'm sure he knew, but we just never talked about it. I was so afraid of disappointing him.
Don met my mother, and she approved of him. She actually took me aside one time and told me she was glad to see me happy.
A few weeks later, at the end of that May, my mom died.

Don took me to visit one of his friends who was living in Twentynine Palms at the time. We all went to Palm Springs where I got further dipped into gay culture. I went to my first gay club. Never before had I been surrounded by so many gay men. It was as though I was sent away from my home planet when I was born and now I was finally seeing a part of it... dancing in it... surrounded by ""my people"". The ugly duckling was realizing he was a swan and that it was okay to be one.

At the end of 2002 Don & I moved to San Diego. Me made new friends, most of them gay. Through and/or because of these friends, I got to see how other gay guys lived. One couple was out to their friends but not out at work. Another couple was out at work and to their friends.  One friend had been part of a triad. There were even two straight couples , who were very accepting, that we occasionally hung out with. All of them are very cool people. I'd never had such a great bunch of friends before in my life. 
While in San Diego, I went to my first pride parade. Okay, a club full of gays is one thing, a river of them flowing down the street is something else. Wow!  And, really, life can never truly be complete without at least once seeing the Dykes on Bikes.
Another first was going to my first bear/leather bar. Though entertaining, it was a bit frightening. Mainly because the regulars were eyeing me up like I was a sheep that had wandered into the wolves den. Those  bears  were a bit scary, but all the bears I met outside the ""den"" seemed to be very sweet. 
I enjoyed having ""gay establishments"" to do my specialty shopping at. I also liked going to the park on the weekends and watching the shirtless guys play volleyball.  However, I had to say goodbye to the cute shirtless guys, the gay book store, and the Crypt ... as well as my favorite coffee shops in August 2005 when we moved to Northern California.

Don and I have been here for very close to 2 years now. We have made a few friends, but we still miss the friends we have in San Diego. 

So, now I've had some experience being gay. I've seen things and done things I never thought I'd do. I find that now is a time where I'm reflecting on these experiences and using them to reconstruct myself, my beliefs, my points-of-view.  Over the past seven years, the ""straight"" Scott with an attraction to men has been remodeled into who I am today. But I am ever-changing, and self-remodeling is an never-ending process."

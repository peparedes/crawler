(since that was the last i updated).. i took my course of Makeup and Special Effects for Film and tv @ Vancouver Film School.. and I finished it. awesome course, and i would recommend it to anyone interested in that field of work. ummm, I partied hard a lot, hung out with some old and NEW friends made through my school. Spent a lot of time with my 2 roomies Nikki and Erin, we bonded very well and became awesome friends. Erin and I have acctually moved out into a 2 bedroom place, and nikki has moved in with another friend of ours. Anyways, the new place im living in now is in Kitsilano, which is an awesome location. Not only is it super nice, but its close to everything possible. And expecially downtown Vancouver. I had my Birthday on February 18th... so you all missed that.. haha. ummm I went to California for the Christmas Holidays to stay with mom and sarah for the 3 weeks. Made my way to Calgary from Jan 1-6 and saw whoever I could... but thats a long story on its own... and Im apologizing again to those of u who i couldnt see ... =(

"event","Hey everyone!!!
Wow, I miss you all back in Calgary so much. You never realize how much you have, until it's a thousand Miles away :(

For those of you who are wondering, I'm settled in my New place in Burnaby BC. a very nice house with 3 bedrooms and an awesome location just blocks from the Biggest mall in the lower mainland here. Its amazing. Im living with 2 awesome girls, Nikki and Erin. We were definetly meant to live together. How often do you find 2 roomates who also eat KD with Ketchup and pepper!?! LOL
Our nites around the house here usually consist of a movie, Pj's and junk food.
I'm still very homesick, and i have that feeling inside as if this is just a long vacation and i'll be going back home to Calgary anytime now.. but that's not the case anymore.. which is scary.

I didnt talk about my trip to California like.. at all!!! sooo, My mom, sarah and I drove down to Occidental (a little town in Cali). This is where my mom and Sarah are now Living with my mom's husband. Its such a cool house, on the top of a huge hill, looking over the town. It'll take a lot of getting used to for sarah to live there. We're big city girls, and now she's living in a 2-stop-sign town.. (no jokes, there is ONLY 2 stop signs).. haha SO i wish her the best of luck.
My mom as well, who is on the hunt for a company or something that she can work for. She's highly qualified, now all she needs is someone who needs her.
Sarah and I also went and spent a couple days at our Cousins Nicole and Rhiannons house in San Jose Cali. That was a good time for sure.
I have nothing more to talk about right now, so i think ill go be lazy in my house hahaaa"

well, i wrote a mini blog of Today on my Main Page, so if u havent read that yet.. go read it cuz im not typing it again here!!!.

I only really have one thing to say,.. it's the fact that i think some people just don't know how to live their life to it's fullest. I really wish there was something I could do to make some people see that sitting around and hoping something good will happen, is just wasting what time we have. You only live once, and u shouldnt spend that time locked up, being depressed about something that happened in the past, something that u most likely can't change.. 
There are many opportunities out there waiting for us, you just gotta know when to jump in and take a firm grab, because if you arent careful.. it could easily slip away before u even know it's gone.
i wish a lot of people out there, a happy and fulfilling journey in life. I really do.

okie, thanx.

(sorry, i aint no psycho-therapist... buttttt I do know what i'm talking about, even if u dont hah)"

We also watched a lot of movies. ""Lilo and Stitch"" was the first one we watched, on Ramey's Computer... it was such a sad movie, both me and Nancy cried. Im not gunna spoil the movie, but u must see it.. its just too cute.
We also watched ""dude, where's my car"", ""Not another teen movie"", and ""loser""... We didnt get through all these movies, we just kept flipping back and forth through her Satellite... 
When we went to Wendy's, there were these guys that STARED at nancy and i when we walked in as if we were some sorta goddesses or something.. it was so pathetic, and u could tell that they had absolutely no lives. They would go to all extents just to turn around and look at us.. ugh it was horrible.. 
they were uggglllyyy nasty guys who thought they were gods gift to women or something. I of course was rather annoyed by them, just because of how pathetic they were. ""maybe u should take a picture, they last longer""... is what i kept saying, and the dirty looks i flashed were great too.

anywho, Nancy and I had a pretty fun nite. I'm gunna miss her SOOO much when I leave. I dont think anyone has an idea of how much this girl means to me.... she's irreplaceable."

Why would i wanna hang out with someone who always rags on me for being a ""sell-out""... (someone who says they'll do something, and they don't)
First off, I'm NOT a sell-out. I dont remember signing and agreement saying i would go to every wingnite.
it kinda pisses me off how everyone expects so much from me, as if i Owe them something?.. i dont think so, and im not trying to be rude.. but i DO have other things I have to do sometimes, and i dont find it fair to be called something rude when i cant be somewhere for many reasons.
Sorry for being in Vancouver with my other friends.. am i not allowed to have other friends?.. puhhh-lease!!!

We're gunna head out of Calgary Sunday morning, probly arounf 8am or ealier?... and I think we might spend the first night either in Whistler or at Cultus Lake... 2 seperate roads, both in different directions. the issue is $. We have a free place to spend the nite in Whistler with Kats snowboarding buddies.. and yet camping is super cheap and fun @ cultus!!!.. so the decision will most likely be one of those... ok, here's the roads.. Left or right!?!?!!?... so we'll see what happens.
We are for sure gunna spend as much time as possible with Jordan.. (oh my Lordy i cant wait)... I think there's a sushi dinner in like @ the Korean BBQ... oOoO im looking forward to that for sure. Maybe a walk on the beaches?... little shopping?... I guess it's just a ""see what happens"" kinda trip.
But i cant stress enough how much I am looking forward to seeing Jordan... I KNOW i am gunna cry... so i better pack the kleenex.. ehehehe.

on a Stampede Note.. I quit yesterday.!!!! Its got to be the first in 3 years .. ive never quit from there.. its a pretty long story though.. so get yourself a drink.. LMAO.. im kidding.
We got all new staff this year, so none of the managers or anyone knew who we all were, and the fact that Scott, Kat, Mark and I have all been working there for at least 3 years or more!!!... anyways.. I have a bad ankle [[a torn achilles tendon and a fractured heal to be more specific]].. and ive had this for 4 years and everyone i worked with knew that if i walked too much, and was on my feet lots, my ankle would swell and i would be in enough pain that i couldnt walk... WELLLLLL.. my manager who I already thought was a bitch yelled at me and got all riled up about the fact that i was sitting down because i couldnt walk.. she said ""ohh, thats a pretty lame excuse, ive heard that one a million times!"".. and i showed her my ankle, and she said nothing was wrong [[when acctually it was HUGE and puffy]]. after i wouldnt get up and work, she decided to grab my arm and pull me to my feet.. and by this point i was furious and i just blew, i was like ""dont u fawkin touch me, u have no right!, here's my punch-pass u stupid bitch, im outta here"".. and i threw my punchpass in her face and walked out. [[yes, it hurt to walk lol]]. And right after i did that, Scott, mark and Katerina all followed... Stampede lost 4 of their best vendors, and now they're gunna be hooped!!!.

On a HAPPIER note... i made a sequence picture of the millenium drop..... haha

And this year has BY FAR been the best yet. I work with the most amazing people in the Paddock @ the grandstand, and i make a shitload of $$$.
Anyways!!!!!.. Kat and I have been livin' it up.. totally!
Weve been doing a bit of shopping during our breaks. Ive probly eaten' ALL the kinds of stampede food there is, im done ALMOST every ride...and ive watched most shows.
Today was AMAZING!!!... there's this new ride this year called ""Millenium Drop""... its where they take this huge ass crane, and they hoist u up 120Ft in the air, they hook u up to this harness, hang u there.. and let u FREE-FALL 80Ft into this huge Blue net that hangs under the platform... The first day of Stampede, i saw it and said "" i HAVE to do that... I HAVE TO!!!!"".. and today.. i DID IT!!.. it was the biggest thrill i have ever felt.. freefalling backwards into this net... never knowing when you're gunna hit... it was awsome.
I got my picture taken @ the top, and i LOVE it!!!! haha.
anyways, i had another awesome day @ stampede... only 7 more days left!!!..

Well, i worked a shit shift today from 10:45-7.. oh man it was brutal!!!.
I was on the phone with Jordan until 3am, i didnt wanna get off!!!!.. but i had to drive my mom to the airport at 3:30.. oh man... its hard driving when you're falling asleep and tired... mmm coffee. Yeh so thats why my day @ work was horrible, i was just tired as heck!!.. =(
After work i stopped by Arryls new house, checked it out, and then we headed back to my house to hang out for an hour and get ready to head downtown.
First stop Downtown was Millenium Park [[the huge ass skate park]].. there was Bif Naked, and some other bands, and shows and stuff going on.. it acctually kinda sucked.. so we moved on and made our way to Scottman's hill [[a big big hill behind the stampede grounds.. it faces towards the grandstand, where i work during stampede]].. arryl and I found our spot on the cliffs, and sat and waited. The fireworks were Awesome!!!!!.. my faves would have to be the shooting stars, the glittery ones that last forever until they get to the ground, the ones that squeal and then the huge marshmallow ones that look like comets.... oh and the heart shaped fireworks for sure!!! *sniff*.. i wish Jordan was there.. ='(
After the great show, it took us FOREVER to get anywhere.. the city was insane.. i probly honked my horn a billion times @ drunken fools having a blast and waving flags.. it was really fun. After the madness calmed down, we stopped @ wendys for the fab Spicy Chicken.. WOOOOO.. lol arryl[[too spicy?]] *giggles*
anyways, this was the best Canada day Yet... and 3 years ago on this Canada day, arryl and I were on the front page of the newspaper with flags and stamps on our face... =D"

"event","Last nite was pretty fun!!!!...  Natalie, kelsey and pete picked me up from work @ 11 then we headed down to where the 'rave' [[Party]] was supposed to be.. we showed up and all of like 4 people were there... we were sorta confused, but we were told that everyone had gone to CrawDaddy's for a bit, and were gunna be back later. Sooooo, we made our was around downtown and looked and looked for this CrawDaddys place [[its some kinda club?]] anyyyyways..I had to pee really bad, cuz i had already drank lots @ work [[tisk tisk tisk]].. so nat pulled over and was like ""Bush...michelle go pee dammit!!!"".. and i was like ""uhhh ok..."" cuz i reaalllllyyyy had to go.. so i started walking towards the bush and then this bum popped out and i had undown my pants and he was like ""come here girl!!!"" and i was like ""dude WTF!!!!!!"" and i screamed and ran back to the car.. and we drove off.. i was scared i almost peed in my pants. 
OK anyways, we finally found this stupid CrawDaddys, and we got in Free cuz we knew someone there, and we got free wings. mmmm... 
well CrawDaddys sucked ass, so we left fast and headed back to where the party was supposed to be.. and like 12 people were there.. total!... most of them in the parking lot having their own party cuz the real one sucked.. so we joined in, and soon more people came. The party was in the parking lot all night, talking to weird people, and just hanging out.,.. it was acctually really fun!!!!. So we hung out there for the nite, making new friends and doing stupid stuff [[such as walking into the rave and stealing water, to swimming in the outdoor pool that was fenced up and dancing in the parking lot(not literally)]]... After that whole shindig, Natalie and I dropped Pete and Kelsey off @ petes house, and we drove around trying to find something to do... [[it is now 4am..]]... there is NOTHING to do @ 4am in Calgary.. so we went to 7/11, bought some water and slept in the car for like 30 mins or so.
We woke up, both looked at eachother and were like ...""mmmm fooooooood"".. so we headed to Denny's [[ew I know, but we were hungry ok!!]]. we got there and I had fun grossing out natalie while we ate our grand slam slugger breakfasts.. i was all talking about hookers and prostitutes and how our food made a play about a dirty hooker [[the syrop container]] and the guy who picked her up [[the sausage]].. and yeh u had to be there, i cant really explain.. anyways, we had so much fun talking sick, and making other people laugh. 
After our grand slams... [SLAM ME NATALIE, SLAM ME!!!!]] (another long story).. lol , We headed to my house where i was dropped off... and i lay in bed.. trying to sleep for maybe an hour?.. didnt happen, i was too wired on coffee... 

so thats my all niter story.
im gunna go eat some more.. HEHE"

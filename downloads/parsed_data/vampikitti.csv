"event","Ok so.. there is this girl I know who is around the same number of weeks pregnant and she went and had a 3d special early ultrasound done and found out what she is having. I didn't think you could do that... so I went looking and found a place like 5-10 minutes from me that does it. They say at a mear 15 weeks (which by the way I am 15 weeks 2 days today) they can tell you whta gender baby you are having, and if not you get to go back for FREE to find out until they can tell. 

So needless to say I'm going to call for a appointment tomorrow... I'd LOVE to have one done this week but I'd totally settle for one next week. I could ""just"" wait until my 18-20 week one but BAH. That's forever away and darn it I want to know what I'm having NOW! Hehe. :P So be expecting a update in the near future..."

"event","Well I guess I was in denial or some thing because I decided no way were my friends going to stop being my friend just because I'm pregnant. Yeah well, WRONG. One friend tries to ignore the fact and has become kind of unpleasant to be around. Another who has had two losses (both of which I was very sympathetic to) is mad at me for any and everything. Mostly because she doesn't want to come out and say she is ridiculously jealous. Yet another friend who had been told she will probably never have kids gives me dirty looks and tries to avoid speaking to me. What the fuck, seriously? 

I'm sorry if you aren't pregnant, can't get pregnant, or whatever other reason you think is ok to be mad at me for. I didn't choose to have a baby to spite YOU, I'm not trying to hurt YOU. My husband and I decided the time was right for US to have a baby. I would say I'm sorry I had ZERO trouble getting pregnant but I'm NOT. I'm thankful and happy. 

I guess the few friends I have that already have children are about to see more of me. Except a couple long time friends they are the only ones happy for me. Which I think is ridiculous. I would've been very happy if anyone else got pregnant but apparently they can't return that favor to me."

To give you an idea here is a picture from when I found out I was pregnant at 4 weeks. The second one I took today.

I'm really on pins and needles now to know what the gender is! I'm sick of callin' baby an 'it'. I get that special ultrasound on May 14. I'll be 18, almost 19, weeks at that point."

And I've been getting dizzy loads too, from the simplest things like standing for 10 mins. I'm in the stage where my body hasn't made enough blood to go around so the baby and I are ""fighting"" each other for it. Meaning *I* get dizzy, baby gets blood and grows. :P Oh well they need it more at the moment. I have the most insane appitite ever, I eat all day long. And if I go oh say a hour without eating, you probably should just feed me and not say or do anything else. I become ANGRY hungry preggo. I think you can just barely see my uterus pushing out but only if I'm not wearing pants, meaning only I ever see it right now. 

I am so very, very excited to actually have my baby bump. Also excited to hear a heart beat which wont be for a little bit. Really excited to get to see my little pumpkin on the ultrasound. And well, jumping out of my skin to meet my baby. Yeah.

"event","This was NOT writen by me, however I think it has to be the funniest thing I've read in a looong time. ENJOY!



I'm 8 months pregnant and I'm not one of those women who thinks that means that everyone should bend over backwards to help me or that the sun shines directly out of my ass every morning. But for God sakes have some common courtesy. 

Like when you're walking backwards talking to your friend and you slam into my stomach and almost knock me down, go ahead and apologize. Yes I realize if my gut didn't extend so far it wouldn't of happened. Yes, if I'd been paying more attention to the giant Sasquatch that is you walking backwards instead of minding my own business I could've moved. Yes, it fucking hurt. Don't get all pissy and glare back when I glare at you because you didn't even apologize. You slammed into me and my unborn child, this does not give you the right to glare. 

When your 3 year old asks me what's under my shirt and than tries to yank it up to see, stop them. Don't laugh and say he's just curious and go about your business. I get it kids are curious, explain to him that it's a baby and tell him that it's not polite to yank up people's shirts. How would you like it if I yanked up your shirt so that everyone in the fucking store could get a look at your gigantic gut that looks like your kid fucking clawed his way out. 

Just because I'm pregnant doesn't mean I want to talk to you! I don't care how swollen your feet got, how much you gained, or how hard the baby kicked. I'm bored enough when I have to talk about me and my pregnancy without hearing how you spent 23 hours pushing little Stevie out while your good for nothing husband screamed like a little girl and got a concussion hitting his head when he fainted during the episiotomy. Another thing...... it's NEVER appropriate to ask a complete stranger whether they've got Hemorrhoids yet, laughing and calling it the ring of fire doesn't make it anymore appropriate. 

Did the entire fucking world start taking happy pills as soon as I started showing? If one more stranger smiles and waves at me I'm gonna shit this kid out right here and use his umbilical cord to strangle that person to death. It's creepy. How would you like it every where you went strangers smiled and waved at you. It's bad enough I've gotta deal with the wal-mart greeters! It feels like I'm stuck in the truman show. 

Don't touch my stomach. I don't care how big it is, don't fucking touch it. I don't rub your thunder thighs and ask how you feel today do I? No I don't, because it's rude and it would make you uncomfortable. When I say I don't like to be touched don't smirk and ask me how I got in this situation if I don't like being touched. Let me spell it out for you, I'm trying to be nice, but I don't want you a complete and utter stranger to touch me.

For some reason people feel compelled to bend down on both knees and talk to my stomach in a high pitched baby voice. The baby doesn't like it, and neither do I. I especially don't like that it puts your nose about two inches away from my vagina and I'm never positive if you're really just trying to catch a whiff of my ""special flower"". So next time one of you morons bends down to discretely sniff my twat I'm going to hike my leg, grab your head, and ask if the babys crowning yet. 

When I'm sitting on a bench outside the store waiting for my boyfriend to pull up the car don't sit 2 inches away from me with your disgusting cancer stick. There's another bench two feet away, sit there. If you are dumb enough to sit next to me and I politely ask you not to because of your disgusting cancer stick don't get all pissed off and tell me that you're outside. I know you're outside, I also know that theres another bench right there, that I was sitting here first, and that 2nd hand smoke is bad for unborn children. I shouldn't have to move because of your disgusting habits. 


Now to the prego lovers or as I like to call them chubby chasers who decided to specialize. Yes, I have had sex. Yes, I still have sex. Yes, the thought of you cumming on my unborn child's forehead makes me want to vomit. 

When I'm out eating dinner and your cue ball bounces off the pool table and lands near my feet don't glare at me and mumble some smart ass comment because I don't bend down to get it. If you don't like going to get it, learn not to bounce it off the table. I'm not the problem here, this is your problem. You bounced the ball off the table, you go get it. My boyfriend has to tie my shoes for me because it's so uncomfortable to bend down. I'm not getting your cue ball for you. 

Maybe you haven't heard but there's a fucking leash law. Just because Fido doesn't bite doesn't mean I want a 90 lb dog jumping on my stomach. Don't say I need to ""take a chill pill"" when I yell at your dog to stay down or kick him to keep him off of me. Don't threaten to call the cops, I'll call them. Yes, I know your dog wasn't trying to hurt me. No, I don't like hurting animals and I did feel bad that I had to kick him. Yes, you're gigantic mutt jumping on my stomach could've seriously injured or killed my child. Yes, you should be mad, at yourself for not spending 10 dollars on a fucking leash. 

Just because you're period is 3 days late doesn't mean you should get to park in the maternity parking. I'm not trying to be a bitch but there are only like 2 spots for the entire mall. If you're not showing yet, you don't deserve one. But you're so busy feeling special that you get to park up front that you don't even care that you took the last spot forcing me to park in the back. My ankles are swollen, I'm exhausted, and I'm trying not to piss my granny panties. Leave the maternity parking for someone who needs it you selfish bitch. 

The other day the wal-mart greeter greeted me with ""bet your here for pickles and icecream huh"". You're a wal-mart greeter just say ""welcome to walmart"" and shut the fuck up. Your not funny and your not really in a position to be cracking jokes about anyone else anyways. I bet your here for minimum wage huh? Fucking idiot. Besides, I'm here for fig newtons and sour cream.

Do you know how offensive and annoying it is when I complete stranger comes up to you and says ""You know you're not supposed to drink caffeine, it's bad for the baby"". How would you like it if I came up to your fat ass in a restaurant and said ""You know you should be eating salad....... you're seriously one double cheese burger away from a massive heart attack!"" You'd think I was rude and you'd tell me to mind my own business wouldn't you? Well guess what, I think you're rude and should mind your own business. Not that it's any of your business but my doctor said small amounts of caffeine are ok. I savor the one coke I get to drink every day. Sometimes it's actually the highlight of my day, and you're ruining it. 

Yes, I'm positive it's not twins. No, I'm not past my due date. Yes, I'm supposed to weigh this much. Remember in pre-k when you were told that if you couldn't say something nice not to say anything at all. Well that rule still applies. Here's another rule for you, people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. In 6 months I'll be back to pre-baby weight and you'll still be morbidly obese. Quit wasting all your time giving me advice and do a sit up you chocolate chuggin asshole. 

Not everyone's that bad. Alot of people are actually really nice. I do appreciate the people who open doors, help me carry heavy stuff, and the guy down stairs who caught my cat for me the other day when she ran out. I just wish more people were like that."

And he did prescribe stronger medicine to deal with the pains I do have. He said my results could be the early indication of this disease OR could've been a fluke. I'm a little confused as to why I hurt all the f*ing time if it's not for a reason. I am pretty young to hurt like this, and it's not like I'm obese. Every test anyone has run says I'm a very healthy girl. Hm. 

Nancy is being moved back to Vegas. I guess her recovery is going to be a ordeal. We have to keep her stimulated for a year to really try and make her brain healthy. If she doesn't mind having me around I'll hang out with her. I don't mind. :) We need to do some costco, dog park, lunch dates... course not exactly all at once but still. I get to see her tomorrow and I'm so nervous. I don't know how she'll receive me. The first thing I'll want to do is hug her but I think that might be weird. I mean, a stranger just up and hugs you, would make YOU uncomfortable I imagine. 

On a fun note I'm taking Michelle to Holiday Havoc. She is so freaking excited. She loves Hollywood Undead and has been wanting to go for months. I surprised her tonight with her early Christmas gift. Her face was so worth it. I think it was just what she needed to cheer her up too. A dinner all about her and her gift. :) I love doing things for/with her. And I'm really glad I only have one sister (or sibling for that matter!) I think I would be bias and not as doting on both. 

OHHH! AND!!! Heath is getting a VACATION!!!!!!! On Tuesday until I believe the new year he has time off! I'm sooo excited, and so is he! He may even get the weekend off, but we're not sure yet. I think he'll freak the dogs out though since they are so used to it being just us 3. He meddles in their routine and though they love him they don't appreciate it. :P Sucks to be them I guess."

Paul came to get some photos and music to help stimulate her memory. He is understandably upset, but puts on a strong face because that's just the kinda guy he is. Strong. I try not to think about it. When I do I think fun things like, she doesn't remember the wedding and how she told me, ""now you're one of the Szymanski girls!"" or how I rushed to her before the ambulance showed the day she had a stroke or how we share a love of our dogs. Or a lot of things. 

And even more fun is that Heath has been working 12 to 15 hour days for a week. Tomorrow he goes in at 2am! Ugh. He'll be doing this right up until nearly Christmas. I really, REALLY don't mind staying at home. Normally. Normally my husband comes home & has dinner with me. Normally Nancy and I can hang out at least once a week. I am slightly starved for interaction and yet becoming a big ol' recluse. I talk to the dogs way too much... :/ 

Ugh. This fall/winter season really just isn't going well for me.

Tomorrow I go see the rhuematoligist for the first time. Very nervous. About what he'll say and what tests he'll do. I could put money on the fact he'll want my blood. I'm going to TRY not to faint. Try being key here.

Oddly in spite of all the RIGHT NOW crap, I do really love my life. I swear it doesn't sound like it but I do. I love my house, I love my dogs, I love my working car & our special car, I LOVE my devoted husband.. we are sitting fairly well in general, not frivolous but safe. Right now with this economy I'd rather be safe then piss it all away on crap. Just felt the need to prove I'm not all woe.

"event","As of... Oct 29 2008 I was dianosed with rheumatoid arthritis. For the rest of my life I have to take medicines, some in pill form and some by self injection. (Mind you I faint when someone draws my blood and I never watch) I must be careful to not gain too much weight, strain on the joints, and I'm at an increased risk for heart disease. I have to do low impact cardio & weights to keep my muscles strong to support my joints. There is no cure. Even with treatment so slow progress I'll likely not go into a full remission as most people don't. Sometimes temporary ones, but forever, unlikely. I dread the day I wont be able to open simple things or walk or ordinary anything without help. At this point I simply hope I never become disfigured. I don't get to see my rheumatoligist until Dec 17th. In other words I'm not on any medicine, yet. When I first heard it I thought, at least it isn't terminal. 

Yeah well with research (way, way too much research) I've found if it starts attacking your organs it can be fatal. And even if it doesn't do that, pain for the rest of my life! And not just an annoying ache. Oh nooo. Wretched pain. 

As of right now I believe my ankles are my main problem though everywhere hurts at some point in the day. I feel like sleeping a good 50 to 70% of the day. And I'm losing weight. Fast. I've already lost 10lbs. In a month & a half. It started slow, but this week (which isn't over) I've already lost 3. 



I feel the need to vent because I feel like a whiney child talking to anyone about it. Sometimes I think, it's not the end of the world. And sometimes I think life is really over. I didn't even go to the doctor for this! I'd been told before I couldn't have pain problems because I'm too young. 

SURPRISE. RA effects ANY age. 

I went to the doctor for my anxiety. I had to do a routine check in about my medicine. Off handedly I mention I'm impossibly tired, figuring the medicine is the cause. She starts examining my body and asks about my joints. Orders a blood test and ... 

I never expected this. At all. EVERYTHING they tested for was perfect and fine. My iron levels, B12 levels, diabeties, anemia, thyroid, etc... Except oh look, my rheumatoid factor came back a 29. Normal is 0-14. 

And just for shits and giggles this new antidepressant she put me on I think isn't working. My headaches and nausea and SERIOUS lightheadedness are coming back. I'm less walking dead, still tired but able muddle through. And now I have a sorta better appetite but it doesn't matter because it isn't WORKING. 

Right now my left elbow/wrist hurts so bad and has for the last hour I give up and am going to bed. 

Thanks for reading my angry, angry post."

Things may not be perfect but they really are looking up, the truck is running. I'm so excited about it you can't imagine. It looks like my business might really work out and then no more Postnet for me! Combined with my unofficial engagement, (we're waiting to be both done with school first) things really suck a whole lot less. Now if my car would just start this would be an awesome day.

We're gonna go see mama and stuff today because the base is weird having the 4th on the 3rd and all. But she is making deviled eggs so I don't really mind the day swapping. I mean, who could? Deviled eggs are the best shit ever. 

I've started this big art project of these two people dancing across three canvases. 24x20 24x36 and 24x18 I believe. This is the biggest thing I've ever done willingly. I'm all excited, though I can't make the guy look like a damn guy and its driving me crazy.

I also have a scrapbook and its really pretty. Its a bright red leather and Heath bought a laser printer just so I could have my pictures from my camera. It's so pretty.

Any who she really sounded like I was the only applicant and I thought, maybe if I ace the interview I'll get it. Hopes high I go in and chat with this girl who works there for a few minutes until the lady comes out and she tells me I'd be making 7 or 7.50, she wasn't sure which. I'd work from 11am to 3pm, and I need to be able to multitask. Then she turns to the girl she was talking to and says, ""so what'd you think? Do you like her?"" and she said she did she thought I was comfortable and such so I'm starting tomorrow at 11. W00T! And now I just have to go to that one Starbucks after work (tee hee I have a job) and maybe also get to work at Starbucks. Oh yeah. Both of which pay more than Carvel would've and are showing more interest. So yeah, I didn't want/like the idea of having two jobs but.. maybe. It'd be decent money no matter what so I suppose I'll just have to see.

Hopefully they were just to busy to do one then. That's what I've deiced to belive. Mostly because I've officially decided that I *will* get this job and thats all there is to it. Mostly because I figure if I'm *really* positive then I HAVE to get it, that and I really don't want a fast food job. So I'll definately get it, esspecially because I didn't get the blockbuster one.

"event","So... I've said before I don't belong in the garage. I'd only be in the way or break something. 

Well, I was almost right.

See, it was definately a two person (two *strong* people mind you but I was the only one here) job and so I was helping. We were lifting the engine with the cherry picker thingy and we needed to put on of the legs down, the pin would *not* go in for anything. 

Now, for those of you who don't know what the hell this is its a little crane to move the engine in and out of the vehicle, it weighs at least 2 tons or so and is well, dangerous. 

Anywho, I wasn't heavy enough to make it so we could slip the pin in the hole and secure the leg, so Heath got up to do it and I tried to push the pin. This proved to be annoyingly impossible, and he let some of his weight off of it... that would be when the engine moved slow motion and crashed to the floor. The well over 500lb engine, which I was sitting next to and luckily not UNDER. Though I did get bumped in the head and arms from the cherry picker the engine got my foot. Heath freaked out <i>so</i> horribly. He was worried I had been badly hurt, I was terrified the engine we put so much work and money into was ruined. 

Amazingly, and I can't empahsize this enough, the engine was fine. A little scraped on the oil pan but thats it, however it did kinda land on the clutch piece thing and we had to get a new part of it. As for me I was lucky too, the only thing really hurt was my foot. It swelled up for a bit and my vien was dented but its fine now, doesn't hurt to walk or anything. Even luckier is that the 'fan' part that hit me was plastic and not a metal or else it would've severed my foot and smashed itself. I'm so shocked at the amount of luck we had, but I'm not questioning it. That's for sure.

On another note, movies tonight! w00t."

So, I'm tired and it's 8:30. That's wrong. I'm positive I can blame my pill though. Stupid thing, every goddamn day its something else. One day I feel sick as can be, then I just cried about things I wasn't even wanting to *talk* about much less cry, and now I'm exhausted. I'm really just waiting for the spotting now.

Oh! Lucy says she has pictures of us. I'm very curious, because we have few shitty pictures of us. I want good ones. And I don't remember her taking any so that too. However I have the feeling she isn't coming over tonight, something about Pale. Who knows.

"event","It was odd, in that not really but lets pretend way, but this past week or so I've been thinking a lot of things that start out something like ""Now see, Missi would appricate that..."" or ""I wish Missi was here for (insert random reason or thing)"". Bah. But trying to actually mend anything with anyone, or hell trying to keep a friendship up with people who were never mad seems basically impossible. I keep trying, and I don't know why. Heath says I need to try harder to make new friends. While new people can be interesting, even fun, the last thing I really want right now (now being lately... not just this second) is to build up random brand new friendships with people. I quite frankly miss having people I *know* and was able to trust for a long time. Course, at the same time I've been shying away from any friends because I'd rather avoid people critquing my relationship. Sometimes its difficult, and I get really, *really* frustrated but in all this is simply the best relationship I've ever been in. I dunno. I should sleep, but really don't feel like it. I'm not in the mood to think, or cry, or sleep or any number of things. I suppose I wouldn't mind talking to someone, only as long as it didn't involve me thinking too much or crying. I'll probably end up playing games so I don't have to think seriously. I did like driving today though. In that, being in a car with loud music, completely in control of where I went and capable of flat out leaving. Course.. I brought Michelle with me as to *not* encourage doing that. But still. The option was nice enough.

"event","Songs can hold so much euphoric feelings that transend the time and relationship that gave them meaning. Whether or not the feelings for a person are still there, I've found that within a song it ever happy feeling, amazing moment, and the like. Just sitting, locked up inside it. Which is odd because usually hearing a song that was once a couple's song brings forth painful memories because they don't have that anymore. For me, it might be like that for... a month tops. After that, the song is forever a comfortable place. I think I have three songs like this, the first being Cheap Trick - I Want You to Want Me, second is Incubus - Stellar, and lastly is probably not going to make sense to anyone but.. it's Nine Inch Nails - We're in this Together. All three songs in my mind were special and hurt at first, but now are the kind of songs I can just listen to over and over. There was I think one or two other special songs that didn't stick, for various reasons. What is incredibly odd is, I *always* connect people to songs. And I have maybe a song or two that I kinda like to listen to with Heath, and think of him with but they don't feel like the right songs. This is prbably the longest it's ever taken to find the *perfect* song.

Hum, I think I'm mostly just babbling. But listening to the music now is making everything in the world seem simple and good I just felt like sharing. Being in such a calm mood really makes me want to start up a conversation with someone. Specifically. Claire is the smart one, she knows who. Then again I wouldn't mind talking to Claire either. 

Hum. The only thing keeping me down is my wisdom tooth. Stupid thing, I took some advil, or motrin I'm not sure which but it does what they do. Hum hum. Well, I doubt I'll be able to talk to either person soon so I should probbaly just head for the bed. 

But remember everyone... love the Michelle."

"event","So I'm home now.
I was in Cali.
Heath and I decided to go friday. We just felt like it.
That was nice. 
We slept on this giant would-be beanbag chair. Except no beans.
In general we did a LOT of nothing in particular.
We did however go to a beach before leaving. We picked up lots of shells and took pictures and things.

OH! 

It was super gross... because it smelled terrible. We saw this big bundle on the sand. At first I really thought it was like, some weird homeless dude. Then Heath said, ""wow that's a lot of seaweed."" 

But it wasn't either thing. We were confused so we walked on up closer and ... it was a freaking dead sea creature. I think sealion, it was too big and white to be a seal. And it was big. Around four feet long and a foot wide. Here is the fun part, it had no head. It was a headless sealion that you could smell all too well.

Ew.

Anywho. I've been tired all weekend, I think it has something to do with that beanless beanbag chair. Oh! I also got Michelle's birthday present. w00t. I would say what it is but she mihgt read this. ^ . ^ So I wont.

ps. Happy Birthday mister Remy. *hugs*"

"event","So I had a short but nice talk with Claire. Who is still a very cool person.

And my mind went a little crazy with thoughts last night. It was really difficult to sleep and such. I did talk with Heath about some stuff though. But he just doesn't quite get it, being different from me and all. He is a very social person who is perfectly happy to be utterly alone. Whereas I am relitively shy but love to be in the company of others. 

I read an awful lot today before class. Which is probably for the best because Heath got all excited a few nights ago about me reading some of his books. But I told him I can't until I've finished mine. 

Also, I'm at a seriously loss as to what I should add to this painting I've done of three roses surounded by hundreds of little pink flowers. I've still got space and it IS lacking. Heath said maybe a hummingbird or a bee. I'm not so sure I want a ceature. I've always liked my flower collages to be purely flowers. I think I want a couple more flower types. Its funny, its the same sort of idea as the picture I gave Remy forever ago but in color. And of course different flowers. Hum.

The lady hasn't called back, I'm going over to the store today to see why. I'm a little worried, but I'll try to be in good spirits about it."

At 10, you hit double digits. 16, ""sweet 16"" and sex with other minors is legal. 18, you can vote, sex up any other adult, buy your own ciggaretes, and be a official adult. 21, you can drink, and a couple other weird things. But see... Ima just be 19, which is niether bestowing coolness on me or even getting out of my teens. So, poo. Ima be old. 

Oh, and it was odd today. As I looked through the drawer containing *way* too much paperwork I decided Heath never <i>really</i> worked at bombard. I found bank statements and pay stubs dating all the way back to when he was still living with his parents, yet, no bombard ANYTHING. Weird. I mean... really. He worked there for like 2 years and he's anal about keeping paperwork, but there wasn't a thing. I was creeped out. (ps. I was supposed to be going through his stuff, incase you wondered)

And wellsfargo isn't charging me for the 140 some odd dollars I spent on car chit the other night, which is quite odd indeed.

Esspecially for a guy, I think rather poorly of any man who shakes my hand like that. Granted I'm a girl, but I'm not glass. 

School in the rain is annoying. Even if I did feel safely veiled by the darkness and rain in my little lit corner with the cold bench. And Stan! Stan the candy man.

I keep seeing nothing in the corner of my eye and it's bugging the shit out of me. A lot, it's like it's a bug or something on the wall, but it isn't. Because it isn't really there. But everytime I turn to type I see it unless I stare at the keys and not the screen.... stupid non-exsistant bug. 

I sang to Michelle, a good song, not the great one (Michelle by the Beatles) but a good one. And she was so damn MEAN. I mean... I SANG to her and all she wanted was to hang up on me and it was just rude. And Heath is grumpy tonight. And I can't stop yawning.

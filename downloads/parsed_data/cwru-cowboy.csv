"event","<lj-cut text=""i owe y'all an update, and this is all i could think of to write about"">I'm not sure what's going on, but I think I've been very lucky this semester... i'm certainly not this smart!   A few things have hit me this week: 1) Renee talking about school and worrying and stressing about having to study and work hard, and 2) my grades compared to the other people in my program.
Listening to Renee during her nervous breakdown and trying to calm her down (and not tick her off more or make her feel worse somehow) made me realize how lucky I've always been with school, i'm not as smart as my luck would indicate.  I always knew  I was lucky in this respect, but she started the thought process up again which was compounded by the grades I've been getting and talkign to other people in my classes.  I've never had to work very hard in school.  High school I did no work and did very well... which isn't special because i know a lot of people did that.  Last May I graduated with my Bachelor's in Biomedical Engineering, and looking back i didn't work all that hard for that either.  Of course, there were times when I had a lot to do, but all in all, it wasn't too hard. I made it hard on myself at times by doing absolutely nothing (with my core classes freshman and sophomore years (in my defense there was a lot going on in my life: total change in my life from shy, quiet, hateful high school student to outgoing college student with more friends than i could handle, and even more disruptive was the stress and anguish from dealing with my father's second marriage ending and finding out most of my life was built on his lies (to keep a long story short, hahaha)).  And now, it's really hitting me.  This semester I've been working very hard: i work full-time and go to school full-time and try to do my school work as much as i can.  More often than not though, i end up not reading the cases for class and stuff like that and inevitably i almost always fall asleep in class.  I've become known amongst my classmates for my lack of preparation and my naps it seems.  On top of that, I really haven't studied for any of my exams at all this semester.  I put my materials together, and sometimes I look over them, sometimes I don't.  However, the more I look at my grades, the more it amazes me.  I'm doing very well.  But what really makes me wonder is the fact that I'm getting better grades than most of my classmates... even the ones who do all the work and read all of he material for every class.  How can someone who hasn't read anything do better than someone who has read all the material and is familiar with it?  I don't know, but it's happening on almost everything for me.  Now, that doesn't mean that i'm a total slacker, don't think that.  I'm constantly working on school stuff, even when i'm at work.  I have a lot of assignments to turn in and i put a lot of work into all of those.  90% of my life is spent at work, working on homework, or working on homework at work, but when it comes to day-to-day reading and preparation i do nothing... and sleeping in class doesn't help either.  I am just extremely lucky.  I work hard on assignments but am very very lucky on exams it appears.  

Ok, well, that's it.  There's no real point to the post, mostly just to express my wonderment about this.  I feel really bad Renee was  so stressed about it... but I know she can do well with it.   She's smart and knows her stuff.  Even if she decides she doesn't want to to the Nurse Anasthetist thing, it doesn't matter to me, she can do well in whatever she wants to do.  She's just got herself and her family so locked into that I don't think she could change if she wants to.  It's a lot like how I was with law school, until i realized that i didn't care enough about it and that it wasn't worth the three years of work and stress.  All I know is that I'm behind her decision no matter what (as long as she doesn;t decide on something worthless like McDonald's or modeling or something haha) and that I have complete Faith in her and know she can do it.</lj-cut>"

"event","i have problems, seriously.  i've been reverting to a state of paranoia and weird behavior that i cannot explain again.  i get on edge about one stupid little thing and then the little Oliver Stone in my head starts concocting all of these little conspiracy theories and they pervade all of my thought processes.  I don't know what started it, but it's been going on for too long now.  It  just makes my entire life more stressful (which is hard to imagine since i'm <i> constantly </i> stressed about school and work and money and all that), and it gets in the way of me being able to be me.  One little thing aggravateds me or bothers me that is totally unrelated to anything, and it just spreads into everything I say, do, and think.  I've been able to forcefully control it most of the time just by reminding myself that whatever is bothering me is propbably nothing, but that doesn't always work or last too long.  All I know is i need to fix it before it forces me to do something stupid or ruins me.  It'll subside again, it always does, I just wish it would go away now, because quite honestly, i haven't been too happy with my life lately... and 90% of that unhappiness is from my own damn head.
i could go on and on, and get into specifics, but just sum it up by saying i'm scared and aggravated and fighting hard against both... and have been, and will be.  
but that's enough for now, i have work to do."

"event","THis weekend was full of mixed emotions.  <lj-cut>Friday we ate dinner with my parents and my little brother then went back to Renee's to pick up her mom and go look at rings at the mall.  The diamond still hasn't come into the jewler so we just looked at general stuff and walked around. The auto-show was fun for the most part.  There were a few things that tried to make it suck, but well, those aren't important.  I fell in love with the new F-150's even more... i mean i love my 200 F-150 and plan on keeping it for a long time, but those new ones (particularly the Lariat that I tried on for size) are simply divine.  They also had the Cadillac XLR i love... it's even better in person.  Renee looks awesome in those little convertibles.  The Mercedes SLK was designed just for her it seems like. She also seemed to like the Subaru Impreza which was really cute on her, and good because it's AWD.  The major issue that brought me down was seeing Eric and him totally giving me the cold shoulder. For being my 'best friend' he certainly isn't showing any compassion for the fact that i have no free time and what little i do have i want to spend with my future wife.  He came home from Texas and got a job and now has the money and the time to live the partying, go out and drink and club type of life that I just don't want.  I'm not in that stage, to be honest, i want to move on to the next stage more than anything.  I'm ready to settle down.  I was never the biggest partier to begin with.  I put my time in, had my fun, and still managed to keep my self-respect and stay out of trouble.  But even that's all behind me now, i don't want to go out to the bars anymore, i don't want to cruise with two single guys as they check out girls, i want to curl up with my girlfriend or do couple things... i'm ready to start my life... and by that i get a job, have a family (wife is all i want for a good number of years, kids come much later).  That's what i want. Oh well, if i throw him a bone once in a while that's all i can offer, he'll get used to it and start to understand sooner or later and we'll be ok.  So that's the major issue.  That just put me in a bad mood which will probably continue off and on unitl Saturday which sucks because that sets the table for stupid crap to bother me.  I'm trying really hard not to let the downward spiral affect me too much, but i've already failed at that afew times.  The rest of Friday was nice though, i stopped to get a Shamrock shake for Renee and i on the way home from the aut show which was good then we curled up and enjoyed a niec long nap.  Saturday was ok, i worked for a fw hours and did a ton of school work, then left to play in the father-daughter basketball thing with my little cousin which was a total waste of my day in terms of productivity, but it made her happy so that's all that really matters.  She was really excited that i was there, which was nice, I was glad i could be there for her.  We went to dinner with my parents then to the mall.  I got the new Kenny Chesney cd which is good so far and then we played with our future puppy... a painfully cute Shiba Inu.  I SO wanted to take it home right there... he liked me too, hehe. Later we watched most of Bruce ALmighty until I fell asleep (and she did too) for a few hours. Sunday pretty much sucked.  I was at work doing homework non-stop for 11 hours, except for when i went to school to work on a project.  Renee was/is really stressed about her exam and project which is understandable, i just wish i could help.  Nothing else worth mentioning really happened, it was just a long, stressful, aggravating day of work.  SO that's the weekend.
Today started out sucking.  I was in a really bad mood and let it get to me and then I upset Renee which feel SO bad about.  However wehn she met me for lunch everything was great and I think we were both in much better moods (I'm really sorry again Angel, i Love you :-*.  So now, here i am at work, and venting all this.  The rest of the week is going to be extremely long and stressful with school, but it will be ok.
Whew, I'm spent.  Thanks for bearing with me through all of that.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut>Well, it's refreshing to learn that life can't be happy for more than a few days again.
First off, school sucks.  These professors each expect 3-4 hours of preparation for every class period. Let's do the math:
6 classes*2 times a week = 12 classes
12 classes*(rounding down)hour and a half in each class period= 18 hours a week just in the class room, but taking into account the rounding down earlier, let's round that to 20 hours in the classroom each week
20 hours in class + (12 classes*3.5 hours prep time per class period, average) = 20 hours in class + 42 hours prep time per period= 62 hours a week spent just in class and preparing for class
add on top of that homework, travel time, projects, group work, etc... we'll go with a conservative estimate of about 80 hours a week for school (taking into account the fact that i don't spend nearly as much time on it as i should if i were one of the kiss-assing foreign students).
Add into the mix the average of 30-40 hours i work each week, for the sake of argument, let's just average that to about 35 hours per week.
So, each week, i have 110 of some form of work i'm doing each week.  But, to be fair, i'll round that down and assume that it's an even 100, just so i'm not overestimating my schedule.
In each week, there are 168 hours. Hard numbers would indicate that i am working (in some form) at least 60% of the available time each week.  That doesn't take into account sleeping of course, or eating.  So, my schedule allows me roughly 68 hours to do everything else besides work and school work.  Taking away everything else but eating and sleeping, and assuming 5 hours a sleep per night and say an hour and a half for meals each day (three meals, half an hour each), that's 7.5 hours per day doing other essential activities, which adds up to 52.5 hours per week.  Taking that away from the 68 remaining hours after work, that leaves 15.5 hours where i presumably could relax.  Then take into account that 98% of that time i allot to Friday and Saturday evenings so i can see my Baby, which is the only thing i really have going for me at the moment... well, the point is, this life sucks. school needs to end.

So, aside from that, after two extremely long days in a row (12 hours then 16 hours) and before another one (14 hours) , i find out that the one bar/club that i actually enjoy, and really loved, is closing for good.  Not only have i been going there for 6, almost 7 years (more than a quarter of my life), but it was the place where i first officially met Renee and where i saw hr the most often over the four years before we started dating when we were just friends.  So, to make a long story short, because of ghetto pieces of crap who decide that they want to go to a COUNTRY BAR but can't keep themselves behaved, the one club that us actual country fans enjoy is now closing forever.  These pieces of crap (it's taking all my restraint not to let out a storm of cussing) fight, assault employees and each other, bring in drugs, drink illegally, and complain.  These are also the wastes of humanity who could easily frequent the thousands of other bars/clubs in Cleveland, Akron, or anywhere in between.  But instead, they feel they should go to a country bar and ruin it for everyone else.  I hope humanity dies, I hate it I hate it I hate it.

Next: today. I wake up in a crappy mood. Renee's car is dangerous.  The whole suspension is shot and the exhaust is screwed which has the potential to kill her if the fumes start entering the car.  So I'm trying to think of ways that i can help her get it fixed.  I have to talk to my prents because my dad works at a dealership and my mom's cousin own's a garage and is a mechanic i believe.  But who knows. I'm just tring to think of anything i can to try to help.  I already offered to drive her where she needs to go whenever I can, i mean i did it yesterday.  But who knows.

Ok, that's enough for now, I'll probably remember the rest in a while and add it then

"event","What an awesome weekend!
Friday night Renee and i went to the mall to do some more ring shopping ,hehe.  i would go into more detail but it is inevitable that she will be reading this and she know's way too much as it is.  The jeweler is bringing in a few specific diamonds for us to go back and look at.  We're both extremely excited!  Later, we went to see 'Cold Mountain' (after the beginnings of a brew-ha-ha between her and her friend Jess).  The movie was interesting.  It was good but very sad.  I had heard it touted as this great love story, and after ring shopping and really missing my girlfriend for a week (even though i got to see her intermittently throughout it), i was really in the mood for a love story.  It didn't exactly live up to its review, but it was still ok.  
Saturday started out as usual, i worked for 8 hours and got some school work done as well.  Afterwards, I went to Renee's and she made this stew that was really good, and tha means a lot coming from me because generally I'm not a stew fan. When i went over there though, i picked up a couple of surprises for her.  After some frustrating attempts on-line, i gave up and decided to go to the store.  The first store i went to was the wrong one so then i had to go to another one. This one was more successful though.  I got her some donuts (her favorite kind) because earlier in the week she called me at night when she got home from work, said she was hungry, and i told her to grab a donut, but her brother had eaten them all... so i got her more, hehe.  More importantly (and expensivley, haha... because obviously i didn't shop for donuts on-line), i got her tickets to the No Doubt concert.  I teased her with those quite a bit of course, not telling her what the surprise was but making her promise to be good and not to be mad at me when i gave it to her.  I decided to get them for several reasons, namely: 1) i got off very cheap for Valentine's Day since I'm saving for a ring, 2) Monday was our 6 month anniversary and i didn't get to give her flowers or a card or anything because i only got to see her at lunch before she went to clinicals for 8 hours (obviously flowers would have died by the time she was done with class), and 3) in the 4 years we've known each other we were trying to make plans to go to concerts a time or two before but it never happened because i had to back out (i don't recall but i think it was a money issue because i was away at school and poor).  So, i got the opportunity and decided i would buy the tickets and take her to the show.  They're like her favorite band and she has never seen them.  I love them too (country is my favorite, but i'm a rennaissance man, i like all music) but i had seen them before.  I thought it was a great idea... and so did she, hehe.  (She admitted she looked at the price on them and got a little mad, but of course she wasn't about to complain too much!)  The rest of the night we just spent on the couch watching tv.  She fell asleep which is always adorable, hehe.
Sunday was just great.  It was my first day off from both school and work since New Year's Day.  I picked Renee up at 10 and we went to church with most of my extended family since the mass was dedicated to my late Grandma (i miss you!).  After church we ate lunch with my parents.  I'm trying to bring Renee around my house more and get her comfortable with my family and let them all get to know each other better... after all, i plan on marrying this girl, they should be comfortable with each other.  After lunch we went to the rodeo!!!!  It was awesome.  The World's Toughest Rodeo was here in Cleveland nad I finally got to go to see one!  It was awesome.  I still hold my dreams of bull-riding, but I know they'll never come true.  That's ok, i have more important things in my life now, hehe.  We spent the whole time looking at the horses and thinking about what kind we want to get years from now when we decide it's time.  It was just awesome.  After the rodeo we walked around Tower City for a while then went back to her house.  We ate with her family again (pizza), and it was funny because there was a news show about sex addiction.  Her mom totally lives in her own little box (hilarious story there, hahaha) and it was just weird watching a show about sex and making comments about it with them.  After that we just sepnt the evening on the couch again watching tv.
Today I got to see her at lunch again which was really nice. Walking her over to the library so she could study before clinicals while i went to class, i saw my cousin sitting on a bench smoking with her boyfriend and some guy.  Turns out she's working there doing construction of some sort.  It was really weird.
Well, I think that's enough for now.  I didn't intend for this to be so long, but apparently i subconsciously felt like telling my life-story from the weekend, hehe."

She made dinner and I helped a little bit. Before we ate though we opened presents... she really seemed to like her CWRU pants and  whatnot.  I really think she'll like the cd too, I love it after all, and it's all songs that make me think of her! Then I opened my presesnt... it is simply the best thing ever.  I have my own Claddagh Rign now, that pretty much matches hers!!!  I Love it so much!  The whole world will now know that I am with Renee and most random people will just assume we're already married! I Love that!!! The rest of the night was great too, just relaxing and enjoying our first Valentine's Day together. It was the first V-Day i've ever enjoyed in my entire life.  It's amazing knowing that i will be spending every Valentine's Day for the rest of my life with her... and that idea makes me SOOO happy! She made Valentine's Day absolutely wonderful, everything was perfect... I Love her SO much! I saw her less than 7 hours ago and I miss her so much already, i'm in pain because i'm not with her.  I just Love that girl with all of my heart, mind and soul... and will forever!!!!!"

It's freaking 1:00 at night, i get home and try to make myself believe that i'll be able to sleep tonight.  i decided to check my fucking school email first to make sure nothing has changed for tomorrow's waste of a day field trips, and what do i see???  A fucking email telling me that now i have to write the fucking letter of apology for not being at the competition on Saturday because i have a goddamn class for 8 hours, AFTER THE FUCKING WOMAN TOLD ME TODAY THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TO WRITE ANYTHING.  I got maybe, and that's a big maybe, 4 hours of sleep last night ( i should count those 4 as a freaking blessing, i guarantee i won't get half that tonight), i've been awake and going non-stop since 5:30 this morning, and now i come home with the intention of dying from utter exhaustion (but probably just tossing and turning) but i can't even fucking do that, i have to write a fucking letter at 1:00 in the goddamn morning.  And what just makes the whole damn thing funny, she still didn't tell me who to freaking send it too! Who else is doing anything similar or even up at either of these hours? Nobody.  Every freaking person on my list is happily idle and away and either asleep or our drinking. Here I am, stressing out even more that earlier (didn't think that was possible).  It's not freaking fair.  I'm sick of my life. But what's worse is that i'm most sick of myself because every goddamn problem i have, is either wholy or partially of my choice... and the ones that are caused by other people and what they say/do/whatever, those are my fault because i do nothing and say nothing.  All of it is probably my fault.  ANd possibly even worse is there's no end in site. Nothing truly makes it better.  Talking helps a little but I'm sick of talking about it when it really does nothing and 99.9% of the time i don't want to talk about it.  There's just way too much fucking shit to talk about, and people don't want to hear a fraction of it.  Fuck it, i'm doomed to kill myself from stress and insomnia or a stroke/heart attack of some sort.

"event","My vision of the future is coalescing and coming closer to reality.  Each day plans and ideas become more concrete and viable.  I am SO excited.  Of course there are the few major details that still need to be ironed out to make sure everything is possible, but I don't think they will be a problem in the end; they'll just take a little bit of hard work and research.

On another note, I've been strangely productive as of late. This weekend here at work I got a tone of Clinic work done as well as a large amount of school work, and the school work success has carried over to this week.  It's like I'm in some kind of zone where I get my work done and in a timely fashion so I can still do the things I want to do (like the Superbowl party and visiting Renee after class yesterday to try and make her smile).  I'm not complaining, I just hope it keeps up, it's really nice.  Plus the fact that I'm working a lot of hours (last week was 40, this week's projection is at least 30-35), which greatly helps with the ideas from the first paragraph above.  Even now at work I'm simultaneously processing images for three patients, scanning another one, doing some data management work, and writing here.  (Today's multi-tasking may be due in part to the large amount of coffee I've consumed, but regardless, it's crazy.)

All of the work and school productivity has been accompanied by an intense feeling of missing Renee terribly.  I haven't been talking to her while i've been at work or at home working on school stuff lately and I'm constantly thinking about her.  We haven't been talking because she's been working more and and has had a lot of school work to do. Despite the lack of constant communication like we usually have, we've seen each other and taken full advantage of the time we do have together a little more I think.  We've both just been so busy that when we do see each other or talk it makes me realize even moreso how much i really miss her every moment i'm not with her and ho much I truly do love her.

Oh well, all I know is that things are going well and that by stating that explicitly I probably just doomed myself to horrible accidents and problems for the rest of the semester... knock on wood. 

I cannot wait for this Friday to go look at more rings at Jared's and the jeweler that her dad knows (i'm optimistic about talking to them).  Mostly though I just can't wait to see her again.  I just saw her yesterday and it's killing me that i don't get to see her today.  I Love that girl with every ounce of my being!"

<lj-cut><img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/C/chaoscomesatnite/1069289793_nixvallejo.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""phoenix""><br>You are a <b>PHOENIX</b> in your soul and your<br>wings make a statement. Huge and born of flame,<br>they burn with light and power and rebirth.<br>Ashes fall from your wingtips. You are an<br>amazingly strong person. You survive, even<br>flourish in adversity and hardship. A firm<br>believer in the phrase, 'Whatever doesn't kill<br>you only makes you stronger,' you rarely fear<br>failure. You know that any mistake you make<br>will teach you more about yourself and allow<br>you to 'rise from the ashes' as a still greater<br>being. Because of this, you rarely make the<br>same mistake twice, and are not among the most<br>forgiving people. You're extremely powerful and<br>wise, and are capable of fierce pride, passion,<br>and anger. Perhaps you're this way because you<br>were forced to survive a rough childhood. Or<br>maybe you just have a strong grasp on reality<br>and know that life is tough and the world is<br>cruel, and it takes strength and independence<br>to survive it. And independence is your<br>strongest point - you may care for others, and<br>even depend on them...but when it comes right<br>down to it, the only one you need is yourself.<br>Thus you trust your own intuition, and rely on<br>a mind almost as brilliant as the fire of your<br>wings to guide you.You are eternal and because<br>you have a strong sense of who and what you<br>are, no one can control your heart or mind, or<br>even really influence your thinking. A symbol<br>of rebirth and renewal, you tend to be a very<br>spiritual person with a serious mind - never<br>acting immature and harboring a superior<br>disgust of those who do. Likewise, humanity's<br>stupidity and tendency to want others to solve<br>their problems for them frustrates you<br>endlessly. Though you can be stubborn,<br>outspoken, and haughty, I admire you greatly.

My mom gets pissed at me the other day because ""I don't do anything around the house"", so I begin to start collecting my own laundry in order to wash it myself.  So today she realizes she hasn't washed any of my clothes and gets pissed again and says i'm pouting and immature for doing that.  She's the one who was complaining I don't do anything, so i was going to start doing my own laundry... but I'm immature? ARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

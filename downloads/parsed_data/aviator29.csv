"event","Well, woke up to the phone ringing, and it so happened to be my boss calling me in to work.  So the day didn't start off great, but it wasn't that busy so it was some extra hours.  Got home and the family and I went to Ponderosa, always good.  Came home and watched the highlights of the Steeler's game, which we won.  Then talked on IM for a while with Steph and how she loves chicken.  But all and all it was a pretty good day.  Also got a quote for everyone...


Care for everyone, they don't always care back.


Until next time..."

"event","Man, I've been at work all day, so tired.  But I got to see the volleyball team's little mini parade, I don't think they deserved it, but hey, I don't get a say.  Got home and talked on IM for a while.  Now I'm tired and going to bed, until tomorrow, this is Mullet Man, signing off."

"event","Well last night was a great night for hockey.  I went to the arena to watch the Aviators AAA team play against Gilmour Academy.  They ended up coming back from a 3 goal deficit, they led 4-3 for a while, but they ended up tying them 4-4, way to go.  Then i stayed and watched the Moon JV vs NA.  NA beat them 2-1.

This morning i went to get my hair cut.  I thought I'd just get it really short, then i thought i could make my parents mad, so I ended up getting a mullet, haha.  Other than all that, I'm pretty ugly, but hey, what else is new huh?

Cya all later."

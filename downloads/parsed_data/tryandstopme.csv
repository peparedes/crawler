i saw meet the fockers with meghann macdougall. i loved the movie and the company. it was 2 years since i last saw her and we had fun.

i am now addicted to the 6 degrees of kevin bacon game, except i like to play it with any two actors. i am a master at it. go ahead. try me.

i'm boring"

"event","hokay, i'm back. i'll finish my dream:

i meant to say that my roomie plasters the wall with all of these photographs of him, friends, family, et al. as i'm inspecting the room, i see a huge mirror that my mom still owns and that i used to play with when i was little (it was/still is attached to her dresser, so i'd put my toys on it... you get the picture). i'm expecting that he brought it in with his things, but when i look at the mirror, i see a sticker of me. it's about as big as a movie case, but for whatever reason, i say ""that was nice of kelly to put it there."" i don't know why.

suddenly, his friends come in to help him. they shout in unison ""SATURDAY FUCKIN' NIGHT!"" then everyone proceeds to bang their fists against the wall. then my roomy taps his guitar against wall so lightly that if this were a movie, the sound guys would have chimed a bell. in typical inside joke fashion, everyone roars with laughter. as in dreams, they suddenly disappear and no one cares why or how they left.

he settles down and we start talking. he is from abeleen, texas, but i never find out his name. he is a year younger than me, but he'll be graduating with me. apparently, he's a genius. he got into harvard, but his parents don't have the money. they know the president of william and mary, so they get a nice deal on tuition. he doesn't own a computer, but instead, has a typewriter. he doesn't type papers on it, but instead types music. i ask ""how do you type the clefs?"" ""magic, man."" i realize that i have a program on my computer that let's you type in music (it's strange to explain it that way, but in reality, i do have such a program). i tell him about it and he is near orgasm; he's so excited.

and then i wake up.


i don't know why, but this dream made me very happy. maybe too optomistic. i really don't understand why i'm so hung up on the roommate ordeal. with my luck, he'll turn out to be a dork or a prick and we'll never speak unless his socks are on my bed.


east of eden was a nice book, but i'm going to give it a B because it's a bit too preachy. you really expect more from it the way steinbeck hypes it up. it would have gotten a minus, but the villian is such a delicious bitch! grapes of wrath is 10 times better.

i also finished the five people you meet in heaven by mitch albom. it was a quick read that took about 3 hours (i got very easily distracted by the microwave and what could be heated up by it). it gets a B+ only b/c he wrote tuesdays with morrie and i LOVE that book. you also expect more from it, but he makes it really lofty and there are several questions i wanted answered.

now, i've started kavalier and clay! it's hard to get into, but i'll finish it before i leave on the 15th.


i've also seen 4 movies in the past 36 hours.
1) purple rose of cairo. it's a woody allen film, but a great one, mainly because he's not in it. it's about a woman who goes to see one movie several times because her homelife sucks. it takes place in the great depression. suddenly, one of the stars of the movie starts talking to her and jumps out of the movie. the characters in the movie are lost because he left during a crucial scene. it's just great. i loved it, but then ending was a bit sad. after i thought about it, it was the only ending it could have, but it strived for that casablanca quality and misses. however, it reminds me why i love movies.

2) a bill of divorcement. i am a huge fan of katherine hepburn (she is the best actress ever in my book. meryl streep is number 2). i did not want to miss the chance to see this b/c it was her first movie. i could not care less about this movie because it was so incredibly boring. something about a wedding and a father being insane and insanity runs in the family. luckily, it was only an hour long. plus, katherine hepburn's mom in the film was played by billie burke. you might know billie burke as glinda the good witch. needless to say, i kept waiting for her to ask ""are you a good witch or a bad witch?""

3) manhattan. another woody allen film. it tries to be exactly like annie hall (AHHH! i love that movie) but it fails. it's in black and white and dianne keaton is just weird. plus, woody allen is too big of a pedaphile for my liking.

4) napoleon dynamite. SDFKJWSEJRHWELRKWEJRKW:EL
worst. movie. ever.

goodnight"

"event","i don't know why, but lately, i've only been able to think about what my roommate might be like. i guess i've been focusing on it because i'm going to have to live with him for the next 4 months and i want to make it livable. even so, i had a dream last night:

i'm in my dorm and the walls are painted purple. i guess it is b/c it used to be an all girls dorm (which in reality is not the case at all). i unpack my few things and then my roommate barges in. he's this plump guy with a black punk shirt on, old chucks, tattered jeans and rocking specks. he plasters the wall with all of his, but i say that i don't mind b/c i'm not a very decorative person
---GAA! Time for work. i'll finish this later if i remember"

"event","dear milton bradley,

thank you for inventing scrabble.

<3

here is what i did at work today:
play pingpong for about an hour while intermittently watching osmosis jones, the cartoon show
play scrabble with boss and company
lose miserably
go outside and watch the kids fall in the huge mud puddle
get my new kicks dirty grrrrrrr
come inside
watch more cartoons
go to mcdonald's with some coworkers
read some more of my book (only 250 pages left!)
play scrabble again
argue that MIGPEE, LIPZOOYWEEDSEX, and GETI are not words, but we incorporate them into our vernacular anyway
come home 30 min early

then i fell asleep from about 430 to around now-ish


i love my job"

"event","today (Wednesday):
work
sleep
watch finding nemo
play a million games of scrabble and boggle
take a trip to guadalajara to get lunch
come home from work (yes, i did all of that at work)
realize i left my book at work
go and get it
stop by corner 24 to buy some sweet shoes for $30!
buy SUNFLOWER SEED BREAD at farm fresh (i'm drooling all over the keyboard)
read east of eden
INSOMNIA!

here is a passage that i just read. i'm in love with steinbeck:
Adam said, ""I don't see how you could cook and raise the boys and take care of me and still do all this.""

""Neither do I,"" said Lee. ""But I take my two pipes in the afternoon, no more and no less, like the elders. And I feel that I am a man. And I feel that a man is a very important thing - maybe more importnant than a star. This is not theology. I have no bent toward gods. But I have a new love for that glittering instrument, the human soul. It is a lovely and unique thing in the universe. It is always attacked and never destroyed because 'Thou mayest.'""

you have to read the rest of the book to fully understand it.

yesterday, i saw the life aquatic with kelly. it was a joy to be in her company and peruse books afterwards, but the movie was wierd. a black guy singing bob dylan in portuguese and claymation animals? WHAT? did i miss something?

i loved the soundtrack and color schemes. that is all

and on a final note:

RIP Jerry Orbach

"event","in response to last night's post, i did get up in time to go to the dentist, thanks in part to my comatose brother who missed the bus and had to use me for a ride. thank god b/c i would have definately overslept. i get to the office ahead of schedule hoping that maybe they would have already set everything up and then they'd just process me. i mean, patronage counts for something especially since i've seen dr. leibowitz for the past 15 years (yes, really 15 years). while i'm waiting, the two receptionists congratulate me on getting into wm. the brunette (michelle) thinks she is my mom's best friend even though they see each other twice a year. the blonde (kerry) is completely clueless to EVERYTHING (or so i thought). i finally get my teeth cleaned and saunter out into the waiting room. there are about 3 people waiting, but pass the time with good morning america. michelle stops to talk to me about how beautiful wm is b/c i certainly don't hear that enough. she rambles on incessently about being cremated and her ashes scattered at the governor's palace. something about poking a hole in a ziplock bag. suddenly, i hear a high pitched squeak! all of a sudden, i realized that i farted in the middle of the office! i was fairly certain that it would come out as an SBD, but as i hit the home stretch, i guess i pushed too hard and made it audible. no matter what else happens, farts are the one sound that will always make me laugh (i really think it is the most humanizing sound. everybody does it!). so naturally, i do one of those coughing laughs. i cough twice, but then see kerry behind the computer giggling. well then, the avalanche has begun, and i burst into a harmonizing laugh. both of us know why we are laughing, but we don't want to say. michelle seems to have inherited kerry's spirit b/c she has no idea what is going on and now is talking about her husband being thrown in some bushes in georgia. my abs hurt. tears are streaming down. i really have to pee. i turn around and see the 3 people staring at me not knowing what to do. i finally end the conversation with michelle. she says goodbye and happy holidays. i can barely make a coherent sound.

i laughed all the way from kempsville to great neck road.


i found out where i'm living in wm. FRAT HOUSING. i will die. everyone who reads this journal is expected to come visit me. just ask for directions.

at work, the kids and their folks brought presents! i now have in my possession half of switzerland's chocolate production for 2004 and a $15 gift card to target."

i've decided to start going to church again after a 3 year hiatus. my reasoning is not religious, but purely social. there are a lot of people back from school that i want to see who go to my church. only 2 more years and i have a choice to either stay in touch with them or sink into oblivion.

i also realize that it is 3 am. keep in mind that i have an 830 dentist appointment"

"event","If you've ever seen The Truman Show, then you'll understand what I'm talking about:

Have you ever stopped to think about your life? do you sometimes think that you are either some insignifant little spec on this planet, or maybe the one person to debunk copernicus; that you're really the star of the show? Someone who everyone witnesses your falls that you hope no one saw, hear the farts you let loose in your bedroom, see your triumphs, your loves, your everything.

I have just been thinking about my life and I am convinced that I am just a leech. My life means nothing and I am a failure at all of this. I'm just a nobody that is only here to have a job and pump money into the economy or a nobody people use as a measure to feel better about themselves.

I'm thoroughly convinced I am going to die a virgin, alone, and forgotten.

for turkey day, i went to my mom's friends house and we had a polish thanksgiving like we do every year. i can't remember the last time my mom cooked anything. so i ate lots and watched many movies. i know i've gained a lot of weight b/c i still haven't pooped.

today i worked with 5 kids and 3 other coworkers. that was rediculous.

awhile back, i got a gift certificate for amazon.com, so i decided to buy a movie (surprise). but i decided to get one i'd never seen before. lo and behold, singin' in the rain came in today. everyone says it's great, but now, all i want to do is rush to best buy and buy the simpsons road rage b/c i played lots of that yesterday. i'm too random for myself sometimes.

the moon is beautiful

i have a lot of stuff to get done before tomorrow ends b/c i don't want to waste all of sunday.

"event","i cleaned my room today, which is huge for me because it is never cleaned. of course, i did it in 20 min because mary was coming over, but it was genuinely clean. i also watched the last samurai. good movie, but i still am not a big fan of tom cruise.

i got a $10 gift certificate in the mail from amazon.com. it was b/c my econ text book publisher asked the people in my class to evaluate a new book, so i did. awesome!

i had planned to do a lot of work for school, but i'm really lazy and unmotivated. i am also sick. it started last night. i don't know how i got it, but maybe it's stress from the accident.

i have to get up at 8 to be at geico so they can examine my car. but kelley's blue book says it worthless now. :(

i'm hoping aubrey can give me yet another ride to school on monday; josh said he'd take me home. this is just really rediculous, but once monday is over, break begins! i just am worried b/c i don't know how i will deal without a car.

so as for this evening, i hung out with josh, mary, and crystal - all from work. we went to mary's house and attempted to watch annie hall. it is perhaps my favorite movie ever, but they were uninterested, so we just ate cookie dough in mary's kitchen and talked about nothing. i wanted to make it an early night, but it was up to mary when it would end since she gave crystal and i rides to her house. so we waited for an hour for mary's friend mandy, whom she always talks about, to come over. she finally came and then after some polite conversation, we were free to go. now i'm home and i feel like i'm dying. 

i also smell like cigarettes and cinnamon candles.

i bought, yet again, $80 worth of movies.

i had to spend $450 to fix my car before anything really serious happenened to it. god bless my mom for teaching me how to be great with money. i still have lots in the bank

my family isn't doing the whole present thing this year and i love it. i want to do something nice, like help feed the needy on christmas eve.

i should be watching bend it like beckham right now. my asian history professor promised extra credit if we wrote a 2 page paper on any movie that deals with asia and relate it to the class.

i LOVE the cheesecake factory restaurant.

i should be doing the econ work my teacher especially assigned to me so i can understand what the hell elasticity is and also get brownie points.

i really hope i do well in my geography class. the test on wed was a BEAST

the cia came to odu last night. it was neeat.

i signed up for classes today. i got every class i wanted on the first try! right now, my schedule is
MWF
10 - comparative politics and gov't
11 - political participation in the us
12 - the theatre experience

TR
930 - judicial process and behavior
11 - america in depression and war

so far, it looks to be kind of challenging, but also fun. i want to sign up for more classes so that i can graduate early, or maybe just take 12 credits in the summer. whatever.

I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL DEC 1!!!!

ps i need to get some new friends on my friends list. it's sad to have only two active friends"

"event","today at work, i helped some of the kids with their homework. they had to do stuff with compound words and that reminded me of this childhood memory:

when i was in the first grade, we had just learned about compound words. so my teacher explained that a compound word is two words put together to make one word. then she asked the kids in the class for some examples. one kid said notebook, another said outside, another said mailman, etc. so i raised my hand and said KETCHUP!

what?

catch and up! yea?

umm, not really...

i don't know about you, but i would have interpretted that as insight into future brilliance. 

she never told me why it wasn't a compound word..."

"event","friday:
school blows - i got a 64 on an econ test a few days ago and that just crushed me. but surprisingly, friday was awesome. first off, there was a huge traffic jam on 264 west bound from the indep exit all the way to witchduck, which is about 2 miles i think. the guy on the radio said only one lane was open and it was virtually a parking lot on the interstate. so i opted to go via vb blvd and get on at newtown. well that took about 45 min! anyway, i got to school only to find out that my teacher is stuck in the same traffic so class is cancelled. then in econ, my teacher is pissed that no one shows up and gives everyone who showed up extra credit. then in my internat'l poly class, my teacher offers extra credit that can give us up to 10 points added to OUR FINAL GRADE!!! THAT'S ONE FUCKING LETTER GRADE!!! i was so happy. work was ok, but i got a letter in the mail from wm that said they never got my college transcript which is really rediculous since i sent it out on sept 8 and i have a fucking receipt to prove it. this is the second time they have fucked up and i am pissed. on my way home from work, i decided to return mrs. cook's book that i borrowed for school and my brakes locked up!!! i don't knwo what's wrong but i'm going to the mechanic later in the week. i ended the night watching one of my top five favorite films of all time, gone with the wind. ahhh

saturday:
got up at 8 to work from 830-5. i really like my job so i'm not complaining here, but it is sometimes so incredibly monotonous. so i just studied forever. then my family and i saw the incredibles and ate my mom's birthday dinner at ihop b/c she wanted something very simple. it was a nice evening.

today:
more work, but i got off an hour early that i got paid for anyway. so i went to sam's to get gas and afterwards, i walked around eating all the delicious free samples. i LOVE sam's on the weekends.

so anwyay, i'm really worried about my car b/c it's all i have transportation wise. thankfully, aubrey is giving me a ride on wed but i have no way back. :("

as you may have guessed by now, i have a paper due tomorrow at 2 pm. it is on memoirs of a geisha and all i need to do is write a 3-4 page review of it. well, i read the book 2 months ago and now i forgot what it's about, and frankly, i'm too lazy to read all the crap on amazon to refresh my memory. knowing me, i will not start it until 12 and finish it at 2-3 AM. and the worst part is i haven't started my paper mainly b/c i wanted to talk to melanie and see if my ideas for the paper could work since she JUST read it.

i think i have diabetes b/c i have been peeing a lot today.

i'm having an affair with hollywood and it needs to stop. this tuesday, i spent roughly $60 on 4 movies: gone.with.the.wind, theres.something.about.mary, a.beautiful.mind, and forrest.gump. all great movies, but i really need to save up for a car and xmas.

speaking of money, happy veterans day! i got a 5 hour paid holiday. I LOVE WORKING FOR THE CITY.

yesterday, i went to work, and the kids pounced me. they were told that i had been fired but lit up when i walked in. and on a side note, they call me mr. wobbles now b/c this little girl, skyler, can't say her r's and said my last name wrong. i really love my job.

school is boring, but i'm slipping b/c i failed my econ test. thankfully, it's only the midpoint of the semester and i can still redeem myself.

20 DAYS AND COUNTING!"

"event","it certainly has been awhile since i've been here. and i honestly cannot remember what i have done in the past two weeks, but i'll be brief:

-work is great, however i can't believe how dumb kids are. when i told them to paint pumpkins, like put designs on them, they took it to mean ""mix all the colors i gave you and paint the exterior AND interior of the pumpkins."" thank god it was washable paint, but now the pumpkins smell like milk.

-i am buying/watching too many movies. in the past two weeks, i have bought 5 movies. i really need to stop being so outrageous and SAVE.

-last night, i went to josh's house and watched game one of the world series and how the BOSOX ROCKED THE CARDS 11-9!!!!!!! (right now it is 6-1, bosox)

-i also played too much trivial pursuit at josh's house. but i loved watching ashlee simpson's demise. MWHAHA

-today, i took an early morning road trip to wm. i was supposed to go with sabiha, but those plans fell through, so i left at 9 to go solo. it was a yucky day, but a lovely one at the same time. i love all the people at wm. AND! i finished my application for there last night. i really need to get a leg up for the uva one. EEEEEEEEE!

i just saw my dog masterbate. ew. please don't ask.

today, it's starting off to be the same. i go to my amer poly class and we talk about the judiciary and esinhart asks who can name the justices on the supreme court, when they were appointed and by whom. well, i got 8 justices correct, more than anyone in the class, so i guess that's kudos to me, but hell if i know what souters first name is! now, the cherry on top (so far): monday, we had a test in geography on climates among other things. we were supposed to look at two charts and be able to identify the climate and in which hemisphere it was in. i guessed both cities correctly. AND he said i'm the second student to have done it in 22 years. BAM!

"event","let me start with yesterday:

i was late for school again and i'm concerned that my american politics teacher (whom i think is one of the greatest teachers i've ever had) is starting to characterize me as someone who shows up late, but it's only happened twice and on mondays. then i hated my internat'l politics class b/c i am failing it. getting a 60 on a quiz will def get me nowhere, but if my teacher ever replies to my email, then maybe we can work things out. that reminds me i need to make notecards. i ran into cara after my last class!!! it was great talking to her and eating a delicious lunch together. but now that i think about it, i have changed b/c when we are together, i think of how i used to be, and although i think i have stayed the same, it's quite the opposite. i have become more selfish b/c i remember trying to cut her off and interject something about my life which is def not how i used to be. i think our convo was fine, but she must have thought i was some charismatic blackhole b/c i don't remember adding anything particularly stimulating to the conversation or something new about our old group of friends. the truth is that i have cut myself off from them, or it's the opposite where they cut me off. nonetheless, i don't talk to them anymore and i find that i am oddly happier without them. but i'm lonely.

back to what counts: mary called me to go to cinema cafe for the redskins/cowboys game. i am def not into football and not interested in it at all, especially since i don't understand the game, but what i do understand makes absolutely no logical sense in my mind (a touchdown is worth 6 pts? stupid). however, i really liked being there and maybe i will take up football now as a new hobby. i left around halftime (which was at 11) and decided to drive around vb for 2 hours. it was wonderful. i put on the jazz station, and bobbed my head along and snapped to the beat. i whizzed down shore drive through the trees feeling so relaxed being all alone in the darkness. most times, i would be petrified since one time deb and i told ghost stories on shore drive at night with nothing in front or behind us. but since the jazz was on, i just absorbed it and felt like i was in a commercial. it was just more than that. i went along the vacant strip all alone and then jeanne showed up. it poured, but it was just so magical. the misty night sky, some guy playing ""what i think of quincy (jones),"" and i was one with the road. i wanted to drive through neighborhoods and look at the beautiful houses. i do that sometimes to see what i can achieve in my life. i'm so young and have everything ahead of me. so i went to croatan since i've never been before, plus i'd heard justin timberlake owns a house there. whether or not that's true, it said that this was a grand place. so i tried to glimpse the grandiose life i could have if i try, but squint as a may, jeanne would have none of it. 1245 rolled by and i decided to see the old neighborhood. you'd think that seeing my old house, where i had my own room, a pool, a guest house, and everything to make my friends jealous and host awesome parties, i would miss it. i looked at my old house and thought ""that's over. i'm happier now."" sure, living in semi-luxury has some perks, but not when you live in an unbearable family situation. i don't want this to turn into something about my dad, but frankly, it's one of those classic hypotheses. live in style but unhappily? or live in the ghetto but happy? i think the answer is obvious for everyone, but now it is much more clear for me. just play on quincy.

back to my story from my longwinded speech: needless to say, i went to bed very late (after getting my mom hooked on conan! YA!). i woke up late since the power went out and gloria (my alarm clock) was blinking 12:00. thankfully, i don't go to school on tues or thurs, but i had promised my former english teacher for a meeting at 930 so that she could read my application. i went at 1130 and she was kind enough to still read it. i feel like the biggest ass for writing a mean evaluation, but she brought me so much clarity and for that, i will not be able to forgive myself so easily. then i went to my first pre-law association meeting. i found it to be a bore and very reminiscent of drama club. we talked about fundraisers! i let them do all the work b/c i sick of that word. luckily, i was only there for 30 min b/c it took me an hour to find the place. i seriously thought i was crazy and looking for brigadoon. then came work and that was quite pleasant. we made stuff out of clay and a lot of the kids hugged me. i can't believe how attached i am getting to them. if only i could send them to the admissions committees.

now i am home, wasting my life away b/c although i was inspired by the houses and by other random moments of my day, inspiration is only temporary. i really need a muse, but you rarely find something you are looking for. something is always looking for you and when it finds you, BAM! everything is much more clear.

but on that note, i want to remember two specific things: there are times in my day when i think about becoming a writer, but i am not inspired and always haunted by the thought that i am incredibly inept when it comes to writing. however, i was inspired by maura tonight for the two comedy ideas i have:

1) a guy confuses his 7-11 big gulp with the new folgers coffee container with the pop-on top. he drinks an entire cannister of coffee in one day and you get convulsion fused with too much humor

2) a guy who gags all the time, or better yet, a girl who smells so horrid that you can do nothing but gag when she talks or is near by.

i think you could get away with those things.

and a final note du soiree, i love scrubs. easily the best show EVER"

   specifically: Mrs. G, Alex Gaver, Ryan Brake

2) im in a huge apartment and it turns out it's a dorm.  im with colleen from my work, 4 guys who live in the dorm and are friends of hers, and 3 other people to rode up with us to the dorm. im the only guy who came to visit these guys i barely know. we decide to sit down and watch the chronicles of narnia, except it's a cartoon and the 4 guys keep talking, but i say ""Shut up! it's on the test."" so i start to beat the crap out of one guy. everyone laughs. then we watch it some more, then they laugh and lay this guy down and just start to crush his nuts, but everyone is laughing and i'm getting really mad, but the hot girl takes me off him and says ""let's open the presents we brought the guys as thank you for letting us come and stay"" there were 5 presents and mine was in a box and i knew i had gotten them a snake. but they open the hot girl's present and it's a jump rope and they love it. then i wake up.

anyone have any thoughts? i'll probably end up asking maura, as if she isn't doing enough for me already.

on a side note, atleast i finished my wm app today!"

<P>that definately made my evening, although now i am reminded of how much work i have that should have been completed forever ago.</P>
<P>i went out to dinner with some people from work and that was quite pleasant, although ruby's was not. josh-UA kept complain about how the beans looked like some variation of human feces and crystal is still upset about matt. mary was always a pleasure. i am so thankful for her and that stupid formula i made up to know her cell phone number so that she could bring me to work.</P>
<P>oh yea, remember when i locked myself out of my house? welcome to part three of this ongoing series. i am perhaps the biggest idiot on the face of this planet.</P>
<P>nothing is motivating me to do any work. transferring has been a huge part of my plan, but i just don't see the point. i'll probably be rejected like i usually am and reminded of how completely and utterly worthless i am.</P>
<P>im debating whether or not i should eventually talk to mary online (since i have her screenname, but what could we talk about?). so asinine, but welcome to my life.</P>
<P>oh yes, one last thing. i am so stoked on josh and his possible window of opportunity to go to LA and work for Mr James Burrows. I will pray to god so that it can happen. that is incredibly amazing!</P>
<P>off to write some postcards and further neglect any future i may have!</P>"

"event","i was staring at the monitor about 20 min ago. something is wrong with me and i don't know what or why. but all of a sudden, i thought about my workplace, specifically the people and how mary called me today. i started to bawl at how amazing it is to know these people and that after 14 weeks of knowing them, i feel so deeply connected. it sounds really strange and unbelievable even to me, but i am just in such a wierd place that these people are all that i have and they are all that i want to have.

i just want to turn into the hulk and go on a rampage."

"event","today i saw bringing up baby and yankee doodle dandy. superb films if i do say so myself. i was surprised with bringing up baby, though. i expected it to be a comedy with jokes frozen in time; you'd have to understand the socio-economic politics of the day to get them, but no! i laughed out loud and the funny thing was, i kept thinking ""why am i laughing out loud?"" i couldn't control myself. there's really no reason i should be writing so much as if i were trying to pursuade anyone. i think i will go out and buy it.

last night, i had a great talk with corbet (ONE T) weller online. i told him about the 8th grade incident and it really made me feel a lot better, mainly b/c of what he said about chris mihalik, even though i didn't really care to venture that far down memory lane. even though he is determined to become a rock star (which i see as being very difficult to achieve) i have no doubt in my mind that he'll make an impact b/c he is the personification of a smile.

i was thinking about this journal today. sometimes, i will write a journal out in WORD and the copy and paste, but i don't like the autofix option. the strange thing was that i really didn't know what to write, but when i have the update screen in front of me, it just flows; not as fluidly as i would like, but still moreso than with word. how interesting.

and i love debbie downer."

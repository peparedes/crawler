"event","the feelings of failure hitting me hard again i thought that with her support and her voice flooding my ears i would know how to handle everything and get through one of the roughest times of my life with someone i truely loved and cared about. i put so much effort into making her happy. i could never imagine the way i would feel if she wasent the one i was telling i love you to every chance i got. i never imagined feeling like the luckiest person in the world one moment and then the next losing everything that made me feel on top of the world. i gave her my heart because from the first time i saw her i knew she was the only person i wanted to have it. i knew the whole time i wasent all she deserved but i just hoped i would get the chance to show her how beautiful the world can really be. i wish i couldve kept my promises. id give anything to show her that it wasent worth it to end it but i feel if she says its better then its better. if this is what she wants deep down then i hope shes happy. this girl deserves to smile every second of every day and im sorry to say that i wasent the one to give her what she deserved.
i thought the world of her because she was and still is the most amazing person ive ever met. nothing. no drug. not one person could make me feel the way she did. everything about her is beautiful. she screams perfection. she is perfection. letting go of someone this great will be the hardest thing i ever do. just so shes aware i didnt say i love you back until the very second i knew it was true. when i saw her standing there smiling, knowing shes the most gorgeous being ever created. i knew. being with her will always be my favorite memories."

"event","im so sick to my stomach
ive never experienced this kind of pain
i feel like i made the biggest mistake of my life
ive never regretted anything more then what i just did
ive been throwing up for the past hour
between sobs and choking on tears
its something i had to do
to be sure of myself
im not sure wut i was thinkin
or wut the hell is wrong with me 
i think im the stupidest person alive right now
i feel like the entire world is jus collapsing right on top of me
and i know 
people r gonna judge me
once they find out
i know wut i did was jus stupid and wrong 
and i regret it with every fiber in my body
i found myself and who i was in the process of also killing every bit of happiness i ever gained
all i want to do right now is sit in a corner, cry and throw up
im hating every flake of skin, every hair on my head, every vein twisting around my body, every bone, every scar, everything
ive never been this way before
never thought i could be so stupid
i shouldnt of done it
i shoulda jus crashed my car into a light pole




excuse me for being a little emo bitch"

theres this girl named jessica in my last period class and then theres this other chick and shes goin out with this other girl and the girl jessica always says shit about her being gay and all that bullshit and its gotten on my last nerve so i think tomorrow if i hear somethin im gonna jus tell her to shut the fuck up maybe not those exact words cause i dont wanna get my ass kicked by some 300 pound black chick nor get a referal for cussing but still even if its not directed towards me its offending and it bothers me that she has to make it known every fuckin day of her life. i dont go around sayin OMG EVERYBODY WATCH OUT SHES BLACK DONT STAND NEXT TO HER ULL TURN BLACK TOO!!...i dont understand y everyone gotta have hate towards gays its not like when u see two guys or two girls holding hands ur eyes burn right outta ur sockets. get the fuck over it and stop whining like little bitches if ur so fuckin tough and badass then standing next to a gay isnt gonna break every bone in ur body.


im in one of those serious mature moods this week where im sick of childish shit thats repeated on a daily basis were in high school its time to grow up."

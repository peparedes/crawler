"event","Shaina went to get her senior pictures done on the 18th, im in a few of them,they came out good hopefully. 

Brianas suprise party was on the 19th and that turned out good, at first it was hell x1000000. Then when everything started and people came it turned out great. at first she seemed to not like it and it made me so upset because i put alot of my free time into planning and organizing it and i just thought she was the most selfish person alive and i cried. then she came in and appoligized to me which i guess made it better, although it was a forced appology. Alot of people came 41 i beleve. it was awsome. it started raing latter that night but it was great before then. I had fun.

Lately i feel like me and gary are drifting. I love him to death dont get me wrong but it seems like all he cares about is cars. I know he needs to sell this one and buy a new one but i just want one day where he pays attention to me. i mean i love him and i dont know how to tell him this i've made it clear that i needed him to spend time with me where were not talking about cars. I dont care about cars. i dont know im just hurting and have no one to talk to anymore. No friends, Gary, but he doesnt like to hear what i have to say when i say it. Like right now i asked him to be with me for a little while and he was like i am and i was like no your with your car, cleaning it so you can sell it. and he was like soo come sit out there with me. I dont want to go outside and watch him clean his car, its not my idea of being with someone. I cant take it i just cant wait till this whole car thing is over.He's mad at me for getting mad at him for only wanting to spend time with him not him and his car. I just want to scream and cry and have someone actualy hear me, someone actually care. 

I broke out in a rash yesterday from an allergic reaction to differen the acne medicine my doctor perscribed. my face is swollen and it hurts. damn. ogh well. 

bye."

"event","I need help. Someone to talk to me. i just dont know what to do. 

a few nights ago me and gary went to a party and a few of my friends from work were there and one of my friends has a boyfriend who wasnt there and she ended up sleeping with one of the guys there twice. i wanted to stop them before it led to that but they told me not to bother them and then to go int when she was throwing up to conmfort her but i didnt want to, i should have but there were 3 dogs stopping me. and now she says how bad she feels for cheating on her boyfriend but she goes and sleeps with the kidd every night and uses me as an exscuse. I feel used and im getting tired of it. on sunday she went missing and i knew where she was but i couldnt tell because i promised i wouldnt say anything and then today her boyfriend called me ans was asking me all these questions and i didnt know how to answer them with out telling him were she was because yet again she was sleeping with him. I feel like its all my fault and i cant take it anymore. im really getting stressed out over this. if i had just stopped them none of this would be happening.

help. I cant handle this. i wish i wasnt a nice person. i wish people didnt need me to cover for them and i wish that i wasnt always the one stuck in the middle of peoples fights."

"event","This isnt my first Live Journal. 
I had another one for 2 years and recently stopped using it and forgot not only the password but the screen name. Im not going to get into my life because honestly you dont need to know. All that is important is that well, i am going to update the present. Im working on alot of things at a personal level right now such as making my relationship with my boyfriend currently of 1 year 1 month and 1 week better. Im also trying to make some friendships better even if i know itll end sooner than latter. but hey, live for today not tommarow.

I think i have changed alot over the years, i used to let everything bother me, i would let all the things i felt build up, but screw it. I tell it how it is now. Dont like it? WELL TO BAD! sorry it has to be this way but lifes harsh. 

Me and gary got into a fight yesterday and i know i have been a bitch lately but i have some things that are personal that only me and him know that have been bothering me, and ive been under tons of stress with work and all. I dont think i was wrong to be mad at him. His friend was making fun of me yet again and instead of sticking up for me he laughed at what he was saying. It hurt really bad so i got all pist off and started flipping out at him right in front of his friend. We went out for dinner with some people from my work against my will cuz i was still very very angry at him and he kept talking about me through out dinner lik i wasnt there. it pissed me off even more and i let it be known that it pissed me off. when we left he dropped zack off and then me. I hate when he leaves when were fighting becuase it makes me think he doesnt care about our relationship enough to try to work it out. but whatever i called him and told him i never wanted to see him again, being a complete lie, because with out him i would absolutly die. and he got pissed and hung up, i got mad, started crying and took my ring off, planning to never put it back on, nedless to say its back on. i cried for about 20 min telling myself i knew it was going to happen, i shouldnt have gotten so attached and how i wished i didnt love him. I called him back and told him to get his stuff i didnt want anything to do with him anymore, then i told him to come back because that wasnt working, because i wanted to talk to him about us. He was crying and that made me feel like complete shit. he came back and he just cried in my arms and that made me feel so close to him like you wouldnt belive. that kid is my one and only everything i would honestly die if i ever lost him. i told him i was sorry and that i wanted him to stop crying and i told him i would make everything better but i needed his help. He hears that alot from me but i am trying. the stress is making me a total bitch and i hate it because i take it all out on him and i feel bad. but then we made up and were happy again. I LOVE HIM TO DEATH! 

I had alot of free time today seening i didnt have to go to work until like 6. gary took me to pay some of my phone bill and then we went back to my house and did some stuff for my younger sisters suprise party. Then we went down to New Haven so he can get some money from his uncle. we had to do like 90 all the way home because we both had to be at work at 6 and it was already 4:30. we made it to my house at 5:15ish and he had to zoom to his house and to his work in 45 minutes. He just made it i persume. 

were better today. He left about 35 minutes ago and ill see him tommarow maybe if he doesnt go work with his uncle. but i have to go get some sleep, its 12:05 right now. ok good night.

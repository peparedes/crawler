started his conditioning for the transplant.  His
first dose of radiation was Saturday.  It was a really
rough day for him.  He received radiation twice a day
on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.  Luckily, the last two
days were better for him.  He will be receiving
chemotherapy today and tomorrow.  Thursday is a day
off and Friday the 20th is the transplant.  I'm not
sure how many of you are aware that Justin's match is
a perfect 10 out of 10, meaning that out of the 10
genes they look for his donor matches all 10!  She is
a 30 year old woman from Germany.  A courier will be
sent to Germany and collect her stem cells and hand
carry and deliver them to Seattle.  Pretty cool, huh?
I  would like to thank all of you that have helped
with drives, sent cards and goodies, and prayers.  I
would also like to tell you that due to the drives
given in Jusitn's name, 3 people have found matches!
The hard part is just ahead for Justin so please keep
him in your prayers.  Again, thank you all so much for
everything.

Love,

Suzanne</lj-cut>"

Hello, M(r)s. McDonald,

I'm Julia Snedigar.  Ms. Jennifer West has arranged my observation hours to
be completed with you and your classes.  It's nice to e-meet you!  I'm
looking forward to spending time in your classroom.  I'll be sitting in on
your first block, I believe, 7:45-9:15 MWF.  Will that be the same class
all week long or do the students' schedules vary throughout the week?

See you Monday morning.  Thanks!
Julia

Jennifer, we are on an alternating block schedule.  I have a class from
7:45-9:15 MWF every other week.  Next week I have class at that time on
Tuesday and Thursday.  You are welcome.  Let me know if you need class
times for the MWF classes next week; I don't have an early class those days
next week.  Mrs. McDonald

"event","<lj-cut text=""Another Justin update and bone marrow donation information...on the dalmatian plantation...it'll be a sensation...population, etc."">Just a quick update for everyone...  I am 2 days into my 5th round of
chemo and still waiting for a bone marrow donor to be found.  The hospital
in Seattle is making some good efforts to locate a match from a pool of
several potential donors so things are looking good.  We're hoping that with
any luck I will find a match in a couple of weeks to a month, but then again
it could take a couple of months.  Optimism remains, but on that note, I did
want to pass along this website that someone started on my behalf that has a
ton of great resources on getting yourself tested to be put in the bone
marrow registry, or organizing your own bone marrow drives.

     The site is http:// www.imaswabbie.blogspot.com and contains a ton of
great information.  Please pass this along to everyone along with the next
paragraphs.

      I want to clear up a common misconception that getting tested or even
donating bone marrow is a painful procedure.  Getting tested is merely four
cotton swabs being run along the inside of your cheeks.  Should you actually
match someone then you would be asked to give a small blood sample to
further determine suitability of being the best donor.  If you are
identified as the donor, the you will be ask to take injections of a
medicine that will make your bone marrow produce many more stem cells than
normal.  This is usually one to two injections into the belly fat each day
(it doesn't hurt - or maybe because I have too much belly fat right now) for
3-5 days before you actually donate.  Nowadays, those extra stem cells that
are produced by the bone marrow are what are collected from you and donated
to the person in need.  The procedure (called apheresis) involves drawing
blood from a needle in one arm and passing it through it a machine that
filters out the stem cells and the blood is then passed back into your other
arm via a needle.
   Why do most people refuse to donate or register to be a donor?  Because
they are still under the impression that it will hurt too much.  The older
procedure of extracting marrow from the hip through a needle is outdated,
though in rare cases it is still used.  Even if it comes to that, you get
knocked out for the draw and you are only minorly sore for a day afterward.
Trust me, I have had five of these done, all while I was awake, with no
anesthesia.  The pain ends when the doctor pulls the needle out.  The side
effects from the current procedure include possibly a little bit of pain in
the bones from a lot of stem cells being produced as a result of the
injections (again no big deal - my only symptom that clued me in on that I
might have leukemia was bone pain for 2 and half months and I guarantee mine
was worse).  You also might get a little bruise on the inside of each
forearm from where the needles go in.  You won't get dizzy like giving blood
because you get all of your blood back.  You will have to sit still for
about 2-3 hours, during which time you usually get to watch a movie.  You
will probably have to miss about 2-3 days of work total.
    When you put these factors into consideration when weighed against saving
someone's life (forget me and consider that most leukemia victims are the
very young and innocent or the very old and defenseless) I think the choice
becomes obvious.  And that is the point I want to stress.  There are roughly
3,000 people every year in need of a bone marrow transplant.  With odds of a
match being about 1 in 25,000 that means we need a pool of roughly
75,000,000
(not counting other statistical variations peculiar to DNA that put the real
number more likely around 125-150 million) people to satisfy the need.
Right now, there are a little over 6,000,000 in the register; that means
only 69 million more people to go.  I know that is a bit unrealistic to
achieve anytime soon.  But if something so simple as Q-tip in your cheek can
make a difference, why not try?
    Do what you can to spread the word - I am not expecting miracles only
trying to help who I can.  Just in case anyone is interested, I know that so
far between all the associated drives there have been about 15,000 new
people added to the registry and at least one match has already been
identified based on the people we have added to the registry.  It works -
it's all just a numbers game - so let's add some numbers.  Thanks for
listening and whoever responds to this first gets to push me off the soapbox
and point and laugh.

<lj-cut text=""E-mail from Justin"">Hi to all,

    Just wanted to let everyone know that I am still doing well with
everything.  I have just finished my fourth round of chemotherapy and things
are going smoothly.   I think I am beginning to get the hang of the whole
""chemo-thing"".  Oddly enough, I have been getting progressively healthier
with each successive round of chemo which is contrary to popular knowledge
and reason.  Normally, after each round of chemo one's bone marrow is so
battered that all blood cell counts fall to such a low level that one
becomes very susceptible to infection and most likely in need of blood
transfusions.  Well it appears i am the other ""one"".  Last round i did not
need any blood products transfused nor did my white blood cells even come
close to dropping into dangerous levels.  This state is called neutropenia
and with any luck I may not reach that state this time either.  And during
the even numbered rounds of chemo (e.g. 2nd, 4th, etc.)  the chemicals are
more harsh than the odd rounds.  So maybe chemo agrees with me - who knows.
Or maybe that it's my liver just laughing at the chemo after years of Wild
Turkey.  Anyway, I should probably stop bragging about my propensity for
poison before it jinxes me and i go into a serious crash.  So far, so good,
not even any sickness or throwing up (except once - cause the nurse forgot
my nausea medicine for an entire day during the middle of three treatments),
no other bad side effects.  I just get a little sleepy.  So hopefully it
continues that way.  Also, I think I am the first chemo patient to put on 12
pounds.  I am getting fat so maybe I could use a little loss of appetite
here.
     In related news, I have been approved to move to Seattle for a bone
marrow transplant at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.  A match
has not yet been found but Hutch is in the process of searching for a
suitable donor through the national marrow registry and all the drives that
have been run.  For those of you that are still organizing drives please
keep going.  Tons of people out there still need matches and I don't have a
donor identified yet either.  Although preliminary finidings and research
look very promising for finding me a donor very soon.  Once a donor is
identified and agrees to help then I will move to Seattle.
    Suzanne and I are doing well all the way around and just wanted to say
thank you to everyone for all your love and support and the help you have
given us.  We are doing well and spirits are still high - if you couldn't
tell.

"event","hey there!
it's time for a reminder and more information about my uncle justin's bone marrow drive.  it's taking place Saturday, July 29 from 10:00am - 2:00pm at St. Francis Xavier Church in New Orleans.  i'm driving, so i can take 4 other people, and mary has volunteered to drive, which is 4 more passengers; that is, if that many people still want to go.  all they're going to do is take a swab from your mouth.  however, if you do turn out to be a match for my uncle or anyone else, here's some info from marrow.org:

Marrow donation is a surgical procedure. While you receive anesthesia, doctors use special, hollow needles to withdraw liquid marrow from the back of your pelvic bones. Many donors receive a transfusion of their own previously donated blood.  You can expect to feel some soreness in your lower back for a few days or longer. Most donors are back to their normal routine in a few days. Your marrow is completely replaced within four to six weeks.

PBSC donation takes place at an apheresis center. To increase the number of blood-forming cells in the bloodstream, donors receive daily injections of a drug called filgrastim for five days before the collection. Your blood is then removed through a sterile needle in one arm and passed through a machine that separates out the blood-forming cells. The remaining blood is returned to the donor.  You may experience headache, or bone or muscle aches for several days before collection. This is a side effect of the filgrastim injections that you received to increase the number of blood-forming cells in the bloodstream. These effects disappear shortly after the collection.

i'm guessing that doctors choose which procedure to use based on the patient's condition and the preference of the donor, but who the fuck knows.  i've heard that taking marrow from the pelvis is really painful, but it also seems like the patient would get a transplant sooner than with the other way.

let me know who's still in.  i really appreciate all the replies i got last time.  oh, and there will be various food stuffs at the church, such as donuts and other donated items for donors to receive upon donating their donations.  thanks again, guys.

in other news, i found a video of ben folds and rufus wainwright singing ""careless whisper"" by george michael and i think it's both the gayest and funniest thing i've seen in a while.  but it's also performed very well!"

"event","i have a request.

i need people to come with me to a bone marrow drive in new orleans saturday, july 29.  i'd also like to take two cars, because hopefully more than 4 people will volunteer to come.  see, my uncle justin was diagnosed with leukemia about a month ago.  the whole situation still seems unbelievable.  he's only 29; being a navy seal and pretty much the healthiest and strongest person i know, i can't imagine him in such a weak and vulnerable position; he and my aunt have only been married for 5 months.  fortunately, i think they caught it early enough and he was just told that he's in remission.  right here i'm just trying to guilt people into coming with me, but it's an all-around nice thing to do.  the seals are sponsoring the bone marrow drive and all they'd do is get a sample [of saliva, i suppose] from the inside of your cheek with a cotton swab.  you'd also be put on their special bone marrow list, so you might match my uncle and be able to help him if he needed it, or you could donate to someone else in the future.  i'd like to get as many of my friends as possible to go, and i figure we can have a fun day in new orleans afterwards, maybe go to the zoo in the sweltering heat and humidity.  so give me a holla if you want to come, and i'll keep reminding and guilt-tripping you guys."

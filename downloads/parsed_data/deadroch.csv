"event","So my whole life I've been controlled.  Sounds like a weird time to have a revelation you know?  I think part of me always knew and didn't care.  Everywhere I went, everyone I knew, it tends to feel like that still, to this day.  Part of me cares and part of me doesn't.  From my parents telling me everything from which clothes are okay yo wear to what to say or not to say and when to kids at school doing the same thing, them and the teachers.  From Girl Scout counselors and leaders telling me when to talk and what we're going to do to the band doing the same thing.  The difference?  Girl Scouts and the Band had a democracy going.  The parents, teachers, and peers had dictatorships.  NOw one parent is gone and I've got friends and I'm starting to feel the burn.  I've got friends that tell me what to do and when, I've got a parent telling me what to do and when, and another friend telling me to stand up for myself.  My big question?  How? When? Where?  I've been ordered about my whole life.  I don't know that I can think for myself anymore...if I ever could.  I'm afraid of standing up for my own rights!  Lord help me, I'm a chicken!  I had a friend tell me once that I was hoding an umbrella over my father, so that none of my anger and the reasons for that anger would fall on him, since he was supposed to protect me...well, the umbrella fell over and now I don't know what to do...all my anger's falling over on my father and my friends and I don't know what to do with it...I can't hold it in and I can't release it, I'm afraid, as usual, of the immense consequences of releasing my anger, it'll all fall over onto the wrong person and friendships'll fall apart, or it'll fall on my father and that relationship'll be smashed to smithereens.  If I end up holed up in that house, it may fall all over on my brother and then he'll hate me and so will my father...if I hold it in, I'll fall to pieces...oh Lordy Lord, what am I to do?

I've been controlled for forever, and I still am, by my father, by my friends, by my anger, and I can't do anything about it...

I'm to help myself, I'm to help my friends, I'm to help my father, my brother, complete strangers, God, of course, but who is to come first?  My father who raised me, my brother who ruined me, my friends who saved me, people who don't know me, the One who breathed life into me, or me?  How am I to know?  My life is filled with questions I can't ask and no one can answer.

My friends pick things to do, with or without regard for me.  I almost always do whatever my friends do.  Sometimes I really want to and am merely miffed cause no one thought to ask, and sometimes I just do it because...I don't know.  I tend to believe that it's just that my friends take it for granted that they'd speak up if they didn't want to do something that they no longer ask.  If that's so, that's fine, I'll just have to learn to speak up.  Maybe they're doing this on purpose to get me to speak up ;) and that's just fine then.  I honestly don't know.  And honestly, I'm only miffed for a bit, then I forget, as usual.  I sometimes have selective forgetfulness, and I sometimes am just plain forgetful.

Another thing I've been noticing lately.  I tend to walk behind everybody everywhere we go anymore.  It kinda gets on my nerves, because I already end up with stitches trying to keep up with everybody and when they just keep getting ahead of me, it feels like they're cutting me off and it hurts, just a little, cause I know they don't mean it, it just happens.  However, being me, I can't help but wonder every once in a while.  It leaves me with too much time to think.  It's not for no reason that I wear headphones to class, it's to keep me from thinking.  It's not good when I think sometimes, I get morbid, that is to say, more morbid than normal.

I've been thinking about this stuff for a while, it feels good to get it out on cyber-paper."

"event","I've noticed a few things recently.  I haven't had any real friends since, like, third grade.  So when it comes to friends, I'm still kinda new at this.  So I don't know if it's just me, or if this is true for everybody, but it feels like I insult some of my friends, unintentionally of course, on a regular basis, like, every other day.  And my friendship with said persons becomes rather taught because of this.  I sometimes don't know what to say to said person, and it's sad, because said person is quite important to me and I'm afraid of what's going to happen when she leaves, and I know she's going to leave.  They all do.  And then they forget about me.  And it hurts.

I've also noticed something else.  I have a friend who's very good at noticing and pointing out the most negative things about me.  And seldom seems to notice that which is good about me, or maybe it's just that she takes that for granted and forgets to mention that.  And I also have another friend who points out the negative and the positive and all in the same breath at times.  It's good to know one's redeeming qualities when one can sometimes only see the bad, the qualities that can make one feel like one is a monster.  Someone not worth loving.

And I feel like that sometimes.  It sometimes feels like everyone around me has someone to love them and I don't.  Even when I know it's not true.  People are thinking right now that I'm one desperate for a boyfriend.  I'm not.  It's just that all my life I've felt like I was the worst thing that was ever placed on the face of this planet.  Now for the first time in a long time I've got friends, and it's scary and wonderful and all in the same moment.  But I'm still missing something, something important, now I feel like a human being at times, but I still don't feel special.  All my life I've wanted to feel special, loved.  My dad says it, but he's my dad, my friends say it, but only when it's segued into, only when I mention how that's all I ever wanted, they need some reason to say it, to say I'm important, I'm loved, I'm something, they can't just say it, I have to ask for it.  I don't want to have to ask for it.

Also, I know someone who seems to feel my dislike for the romantic holiday is stupid or something.  Well, here's my reasoning.  Fifteen years of watching everyone else get a Valentine that was meant for them, and I get nothing.  Valentines for the whole class don't count, valentines for all friends of someone don't count.  Of the valentines that actually count, I've gotten one, and if that counts, that was because I was terribly ill on Valentine's Day and it was a get well gift.  What is the point of Valentine's Day when all you do is watch everyone around you get something while you get nothing, and that's why Valentine's Day is one of the most depressing days of the year, even though it's my half birthday.  It's a nothing day where I get nothing but reminders of how I'm nothing and nobody to nothing and nobody.  And half the reason this past Valentine's Day was the worst ever?  Knowing it was the first Valentine's Day Daddy had without his Valentine...

...and yet another reason why my whole life SUCKS!

All my life all I've ever been has been a burden to those around me, and I still am, half the reason I feel I can't just bury my head in the sand and run away is because I don't want to hurt people, and yet, it feels like all I ever do is hurt people, or depress people or rely on other for my very happiness, well, I don't know what it means to be happy, I can't remember what it's like to be truly happy, and I'm afraid I never will.  One of my roommate's favorite name to call me is ""wimp"".  She says it to me all the time, every time she hurts me, physically or no, everytime I get sick, everytime I get depressed.  Just because she has a high tolerance for pain and just because she thinks feelings are a weakness doesn't mean she's a stronger person than me.  But sometimes it seems she is, and it doesn't help that I feel like such a weakling around everyone else, because it sometimes feels like everyone around me is stronger than I.  Just like everyone around me is taller than I, and everyone around me is more physically fit than I.  It sometimes feels like everyone around me is more human than I.  And it doesn't help that my whole life people have been trying to convince me that I'm not human.  And yet, it seems like sometimes my friends do the same, with or without intending to.  And thus, it appears to be that my life isn't a life, it's me trying to find life, and it's still quite beyond my grasp, and the bridge to it is not yet built."

"event","So this girl from work decides to try and get me a boyfriend, so I ended up on a blind double-date.  And no one will SHUT UP about it!  Pretty much all my friends are constantly Q and A-ing me about this kid.  ""What's he look like?"" ""How old is he?"" ""Will you give him a shot?"" The answer, mostly, is a consistant ""I don't know"" which receives a consistant ""I think you should"" which is getting on my nerves...my point is, let me decide!  I didn't see anything in the future last time I saw him, I haven't talked to him since, let him come if he will, and leave me be!"

"event","I sometimes wonder if there's a sign above my head that says ""I'm an easy target, make fun of me"", because people do.  People seem to enjoy making fun of me, whether because my reaction's funny, or because watching me suffer silently amuses them, I don't know.  Maybe it's both, I don't know, but it happens.  It happens far more often than I'd like for it to happen, and I don't know how to stop it.  Tonight a friend bought some Shout, and in the checkout lane, she held the bottle up next to my head.  Naturally I flinched (doesn't everyone?) and she said ""It's wrapped up in plastic!"" laughingly.  I got defensive, as usual, and I didn't mean to, and she mentioned as such, and that I needed to loosen up.  I got a little perturbed.  Firstly, I don't know how to! Secondly, I'm not exactly happy with another friend right now, and she mentioned that he was right.  Grr...that man... Anyway, I need to learn how to loosen up, and to not be such an easy target all at the same time.  Great! All I need! More things to worry about!  Life sucks, I'll say it now.  My life SUCKS!!!!  Anyhow, I'm freezing to death and all that good stuff...night."

"event","Why are people always complaining around me?  Is it that they're always complaining, or that I'm some sort of queer vessel designed somehow to contain all complaints?  I've got Katherine complaining about not being able to be in church cause of our job, and that she feels like she can't go away for the weekend cause she's expected to be in church, I've got one friend complaining about how it's cold here and she'd rather be in Texas with her boyfriend (which, BTW, really depresses me to no end), and one of my roommates, of course, with the usual.

I didn't mind Katherine complaining to me the first two times, but when it kept coming it gkept culminating in my mind and made me upset (BTW, I apologize for going off like that, I didn't mean to).  The worst, however, is that one friend complaining about the weather and how she'd rather be in Texas with her boyfriend, which depresses me, cause she seems to say it nearly every time she goes out and makes me feel inferior, like I'm somehow not a good enough friend to be around.  Stupid, huh? Go ahead and say it.  I don't care anymore...well, I do, but you know, it doesn't matter, it never does.  What I say seems to matter so little, people don't even take time to listen, 'cept to cut me down, which just makes me want to stop talking period, but I can't, cause it hurts, it hurts to not talk...I wish Mama were here...I don't really know why, I never talked to her when she was around, but now that she's not, I want to talk to her more and more...but I can't, I can't talk to her, can't ask her things, can't see or touch or hold her, and it hurts, but I can't talk, cuz I always depress people, whether I talk about her or not...but the hole in my heart keeps getting bigger and I don't know what to do about it...and there's no one around to ask about it, cuz there's nobody around who knows anything about it, and I couldn't talk to them anyway, cuz I keep getting hushed up...drat this world and its dumb rules, and drat the people who keep telling me what to do!

I get sick of ""you should talk to Holly about this"" and ""maybe you should mention that to Holly"".  Everyone talks about it, everybody knows what I should talk to my counselor about, and everybody seems to know what's going on in my head, but nobody knows what's in my heart, and what I feel I can and can't talk about and what I feel is relevant to my counseling.  It's MY counseling people! STOP running it for me, PLEASE! ...My counselor left anyway, and now I gotta start all over again...AGAIN.

It feels like everybody leaves me, or forgets about me.  Practically all my old friends have forgotten about me, I'm sure.  Three out of four grandparents left.  Sue left.  Bear left.  My ""adopted"" grandmother left.  Mom left.  my one friend's leaving for Texas.  Holly left for places unkown.  Who's next?  Who's the next person to break my heart?  Who's the next person to tell me that no one can be trusted?  Who's the next person to play with my emotions, such as they are?  Why do I always try to mend what's broken just in time to watch it break again?  Why can't I just leave my heart the way it is--broken to smithereens and scattered to the four winds?  What's wrong with me? Again!  I always find myself asking myself that question...maybe it's because I never find a satisfactory answer...I gotta sleep on this one, I'm out..."

"event","It feels like the past couple of days have been pick on me days.  My friends have been picking on me for many reasons, it seems, everything from my use of elegent language to the fact that I wanted to befriend a person who later became one of my friend's boyfriend.  I mean, is it so terrible if I'd rather use elegent wordings for things rather than slang?  And is it so terrible that I met someone and felt I wanted to know said person a little better?  Excuse me if it's so weird to want to know someone better, and far be it for me to want a new friend of someone!

I didn't know it was so terrible to want another friend, even if I can't ever see him again in real life, I knew that from the beginning, but when I met said guy, he intrigued me, I wanted to befriend him, so sue me!

And is there really such a big problem with preferring words such as ""beau"" to ""boyfriend"" and ""deflowered"" to ""rape"", or even ""tumbled tail over teakettle"" to ""fell head over heels""?  If so, then why does it sound so much better to me?  Or maybe I should just stop reading the wonderful books that gave me such wonderfulphrases or,...I don't even know anymore.

"event","All I've ever benn my whole life is what people tell me, and the older I get, the less it makes sense.  Schoolchildren proved to me I was nothing, or less than that even.  My new friends here are trying to prove to me that I really am something, but what?  I've no clue.  My friend has a friend that I found on facebook and started talking to, being that I've met him and found him to be an interesting person.  He lives far away but when I talk to him it's like a real conversation that I just don't have to say anything for, like he's really here, though I've almost completely forgotten his face and voice.  Talking to him is like talking to a really good friend who really seems to know the being behind my veiled words.  I've spoken to him about my feelings of not knowing the real me, being as there seem so many of me.  He recommended a book, Captivating, by John & Stasi Eldredge.  They've also written another book, Wild at Heart, which is the male counterpart of this book.  He said the book helped him find out who he really is and I feel it may help me find me.  Being as I have nothing to go on to find me, any path is a good path.  All I know about me is what I feel and, more oft than not, that feeling is sadness, total sadness.  I'm sad because my past has taught me to be.  If I wasn't sad I was walked on.  Seeing me continue to come to school sad seemed to tell the kids at school that their work was done, that they'd broken my very spirit.  My spirit, however, doesn't want to be broken anymore; it is reaching out to all that it can find to heal itself.  If these books I'm reading are as good as my friends say they are, they can help me find my path.  After that, I'm still not gonna be on my own because my friends'll still be there for me, for as long as I have friends, I'm not as alone as I always feel I am.  Plus the Lord is always there, and though I'm only beginning to see His works, they are evident and I will see my weaving one day, and it will be one of the most beautiful yet, something inside tells me it is so, for once I heal myself, I can heal others and I have a wonderful, if small, network of friends that, even if I can't see it, are doing their best to help me.  My emotions are raw, they have always been so, it doesn't seem to take much sometimes to set me off, and I'm working on that.  I need a lot of work I know, and it will be a long path but the thing is, I am not alone, and I need to keep reminding myself that I'm not alone and that I really do have friends.  For the first time in my long, dismal existence I live, and right now, that is enough for me.

Thinking back, I realize that I've always wanted to escape from my own life.  The only stories I played out with my Barbies were along the same lines--those of a girl escaping from her own life and finding one better.  Then she was able to bring the two worlds together into one magnificant whole.  Usually a rich girl bored with her own life who runs away and finds a bunch of orphans who are about to be evicted from this abandoned building that they live in.  The girl then runs home to her parents, bringing along the orphans, and convinces her parents to buy the building and give it to the orphans.  All along I knew that storyline was a fiary tale and could never happen to me, but it was always fun to play out, especially when I made interesting twists to it.

So maybe I'm a girl who has wanted to escape her own life, and has finally done so via the school her parents went to, a girl who is trying to find herself amongst new friends who are helping her to find the girl she was always meant to be.  A girl who needs help, and is finally finding it.  A typical girl with a lot of hurt inside.  A normal girl, for once."

Along with the start of school, I'm rushing Agathos and it's very interesting.  The start of Rush activities tonight wasn't the best, I felt like I was in the military with people yelling to stop smiling or laughing after they did or said something funny.  After that, it only got better with the actual activities starting and the rush captains being nicer.  We went on a Scavenger Hunt and made a cross which we hung by the library.  It was fun.  I've also started counseling up again and that's interesting.  Ruth bought me a book about dealing with my past and I'm reading it outside counseling to learn how to deal with it.  When my counselor found out, she lent me the workbook and I'm working through that too.  I'm just getting to the real scary part and I'm not totally sure how that's going to work out, really.  But I'm not allowing myself to stop.  I will go through this and I will not allow myself to act on how scared I am about what's gonna happen.  Just like Snow White said in the move Tenth Kingdom:  ""Don't think; become.""  I must not think about what I'm gonna do, I just gotta do it and do it well."

"event","Ummm, yeah, lots of stuff has happened since the last update and I'll think this'll be long...

First off, I have a totally awesome new best friend!  We've hung out nearly every single day for over a month now, close to two.  my new friend has shone a new light on nearly everything Katherine has illuminated for me, and the two of them have become two of the greatest people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.

Secondly, I have become quite close to my cousin Melissa during these past two months as well, which has become quite the pleasure for me.

Thirdly, there has recently been the most drastic change in my family.  My mother died and Monday, and I was home for four-and-a-half days through the funeral service and the morning after we left.  Katherine and Ruth came with.  Katherine drove.  Here is an account as well as I can recall:

Around five or five-fifteen I get a call saying Mom's in the hospital--don't know why.  my new friend and I were just leaving Payless Shoes, I having bought white shoes at Meijer (We were there for her). I think it's ironic that I bought white shoes that day--don't ask why, I don't know myself.

Around five-thirty or five-forty-five I get a call saying Mom's in critical condition--still don't know why.  She and I had just turned off Scatterfield onto Eighth Street.

Around five-forty-five or six I get a call saying she's dead.  I'm in my new friend's apartment just sitting down to Cheaper by the Dozen to pass the time since she's doing laundry.  I said ""No! Tell me you're joking!""  she jumps up and turns off the movie.  Dad gets on the phone--all previous calls have been my brother and yes, he would pull one of those.  Immediately I look at my new friend, who has her head in her hands--I'm still saying no, I look at her and say ""Momma's dead.""  We get up, hug, I cry, she rubs my back, thirty seconds or so later I'm on the floor calling Melissa, who calls her dad and comes straight over.  Meanwhile my friend's attempting to call Katherine, whom we find out later was watching Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and had her phone on silent--not vibrate.

After calling all manner of systems to find her house number, we finally get it and call her dad, who begins a search for Katherine as well.  By nine, she's finally got us and proceeds to pack and make her way our direction--she gets here between ten and ten-thirty and stays the night here and we all make our way to Dad's house around noon the next day.  I get a pleasant surprise in Megan G. and Megan T. finding their way to the house to make a visit and we all get to hang out for a while before this guy (forgot the title) comes to talk to us.  After a bit, I'm freed up again to hang before watching Rigoletto (sp?) and part of Mark Lowry on Broadway before they have to leave.  My new friend, Katherine, and I finished watching it and then got ready for bed.  It took a while before I could sleep, however.  All in all, I think I got maybe seven hours that night.

Wednesday we went to Palestine, spent the afternoon there, coming back at five, after dropping some film off at Wal-Mart.  After we went to go get it, Jim driving up for seemingly no reason, we realized just how close a bad storm had been.  We're fairly certain we wouldn't have gotten caught in it.  Although, the poor pizza guy did.  Us having just cut up some sandwiches someone from the church brought over.  We left the pizza for later.  That night I had difficulty sleeping, ahving a night terror and crying my eyes out for nearly an hour.  My new friend was asleep, but Katherine wasn't, and we stayed up talking till nearly two.  It really helped me a lot.

Thursday was the viewing.  We stayed in bed for as long as we could, giving ourselves seven more hours.  Later Aunt Connie and cousin Michael came over, they stayed till we had to get ready for the viewing.  We got there at around four o'clock and stayed till around nine thirty.  When we got there and looked at Momma, all I could think was how much that husk didn't look like her, it just wasn't my mother.  Daddy cried and Aunt Connie (Mom's little sister) bawled.  Daddy kept asking the body why she didn't take care of herself.  I stayed away, looking at all the flowers and things hanging around there.  Basically, it was us standing around for nearly five hours solid, being as we did get a few chances to sit.  Tons of people hugged me, saying how sorry they were, I never knew how to respond to that so I generally nodded and said nothing.  Tons of people from the old church came, some from the new, even someone from the church I'm at now.  Some of Daddy's old friends came, including hos college roommate for three years running.  Momma's little sisters both came, and cousin Tristan (sp?) too.  Lots of people from our family came as well.

Friday was the funeral.  Nearly all the people from yesterday came, plus eleven members of the bagpipe band, two of which never even knew us.  Someone from the college put Mom's computer mouse in her hand.  And Bill Snyder put a Boy Scout coin in her hand too.  After the services we ate at the church, with no ham at all.  Yummy fried chicken instead.  Daddy hates ham, so the promise cheered him up a little.  After the food, Aunt Meri, Aunt Connie, Tristan, and Michael all came over, and so did Daddy's roommate.  I finished up the roll of film out of Momma's camara and took it to get developed.  When we went to pick it up, Ruth decided to get a hat and I decided to get a purse.  When we came back, Michael and Connie were still there.  They left not long after and the rest of us started a CD burning party in Dad's room.  there were a lot of CDs burnt, but four more were needed in the morning.

Saturday morning we finished the CD burning process and got ready to leave, us finally leaving a little after nine.  Nearly halfway back I realized a few things that were missing:  my soccer ball, my softball mitt, my Vick's Vaporub, my Sims 2 GBA(not PC) game, my 64 cans of Coke, and my 2 liter of Mountain Dew.  Not all being realized on the road though.  Twas sad, but all's well that ends well.  And this venture did end fairly well, now I'm back and merely waiting for a phone call from Culver's that I hope will give me a new job.  The phone call should be coming tomorrow and I hope I get this job, I really need it.  TTFN, Ta-Ta for now!"

"event","Okay, so last friday my mom and dad came up to take me back to their house for the week.

Saturday--did nothing

Sunday--still nothing

Monday--Family reunion, was the same as usual basically, we all sat around teasing each other, ate, and sat around some more.  My family was there for five hours, from noon to five, plus four hours in the car total.  The dog came too and stayed in the house.  Aunt Cathy had to put her dog out so the wouldn't try to attack Biscuit again, didn't work though, since Gracie's so small.

Tuesday--back to boredom

Wednesday--getting ready for the big trip

Thursday--went to Palestine around noon stayed there until about three, then went to Robinson to meet my troop.  There were warm greetings all around, and we set off for the Inn at four-twenty--twenty minutes late.  The ride was interesting.  Megan Gosnell was reading the same book as I and we were talking about it.  Later we all played Mafia, a very interesting card game, then we played other assorted games, Guess Who?, Battleship, things like that for a while, then it got too dark and we all just sat around talking and singing until we finally got to the inn.  Then we got into our rooms, hung out for a while, and went to sleep.  I roomed with Megan G and Sam.  Same went to sleep pretty early, but Megan and I couldn't sleep--we stayed up talking until around one-thirty, I doubt I got to sleep before two.

Friday--Sam was up at seven-thirty, though she kept trying to make it out that she got up at six-thirty.  I got up close to eight  The selection at the motel was terrible, I ended up with a cinnamon roll and some Sunny D, and though I told Sharon (a leader) that we needed some milk, I kept forgetting to get some, oh well, they got good use out of it anyway, so no bigs really.  We left for King's Island at around nine thirty, most of us slathering ourselves and each other with sunscreen even though it was raining.  We got there not long after, got our tickets, went through the metal detectors (fun) and then the gates, already split into our buddy groups, and saw Angelica actually playing nice with kida for once.  Sam, Megan G., and I went immediately into Nickelodeon Universe, barely, to satiate Sam's giant need to go on the Scooby-Doo, Haunted Mansion ride, which Megan G. won (I got second).  Next, Sam convinced us to go on the Eiffel Tower, which neither Meg G. or I liked, us both having acrophobic tendencies.  Next we wended our way through the surprisingly large crowds, weather noted, toowards the Beast, which was fun.  After that was the Vortex, not fun.  We slowly made our way ocer to the carusel, whilst I listened to both my friends continuously apologizing for ""forcing"" me to go on the Vortex, seeing as Meg G. saw the look on my face as we went upside-down, as she heard me scream ""never again! Never again!""  Meg G. told me the next ride pcik was mine.  We went on the carusel.  I was still a mite dizzy, but I didn't let that stop me from going on one of my fave rides ever.
Then it was time for lunch.  We met up with the group and went into a plave they called the Festhaus where nearly the entire group got LaRosa's pizza.  Personally, I don't like it that much, and I'm not alone.  After lunch it was over to the Drop Zone as my group paired up with a group consisting of Kristen, Kimbra, Leslie and Becca.  Sam, Meg G., and Leslie went on the Drop Zone while the rest of us waited.  Next we went to the Scrambler, antoher favorite of mine, after which we went to the water park, Boomerang Bay.  On our way there, we passed through Nickelodeon Universe where Meg G. got her first glimpse of the Avatar ride.  She liked it so much she practically bolted into the Nickelodeon Store to see what Avatar merchandise they had.  It was all shirts for Avatar and Danny Phantom.  We both got shirts, Meg's being Avatar and mine Danny Phantom.  When we finally made it into the water park, Meg G., Sam, and I realized we'd lost the people we'd intended upon coming with, since they hadn't waited for us.  We went to the wave pool anyway and once the waves started I was alone, Sam not coming in and Meg G. wanting to enjoy the waves from a place farther in than she knew I'd go.  Once everyone else got there, it was the same story, me watching them have fun from a place I couldn't go.  I started wishing I'd never come to the stupid pool, since I'd known this wolda happened, but it was warmer in the pool than in the outside air.  Meg G. talked about how she felt bad leaving Sam alone on the ""beach"", didn't seem to realize she was leaving me in the pool, alone.  Finally the time came that we were supposed to meet the leaders came and they all had to get out of the pool.  We'd all decided at lunch to go home early since it was such a miserable day, but now the whole group, besides Sam decided to stay.  We stayed at the park for a few more hours, it only getting colder though the rain had stopped.  It ended up we didn't leave until after dark, though we'd earlier planned on leaving at 3:30.  Sometime during the day, something happened to my foot, mighta been a roller coaster or maybe something in one of the pools, I don't know, but the later it got, the more the outside of my left foot hurt.
On our way back to the meeting place for dinner, Meg G. got a black-and-white picture of her drawn for five bucks and a bit later I picked up some fudge with Kristen, the two of us sharing our Mint Cookie and Chocolate fudge and me letting her have a free piece of Chocolate Cheesecake fudge, since I didn't want any.  Then we finally all got together for dinner, but it took some doing to figure out where to go, since nearly no one wanted Skyline or this fish joint, so we ended up splitting up into groups, each going to a different eatery.  Then, after letting some girls go on one last ride, we left, finally, once Judy (another leader) had had her fill of picture-taking, to the great impatience of many.  We made it back to the inn close to nine or ten, which was the first plan.  Meg G. and I stayed up later than we were supposed to and watched Naruto, which came on at midnight, after which we tried to sleep, succeeding finally after one.

Saturday--Sam again got up at seven-thirty, insisting that it was six-thirty, and I closer to eight.  Sometime later we went to the museum center.  My foot hadn't quite healed from whatever had happened to it and I was limping all day.  It was fun though, we went to the natural history and science museum first, looking at various gems and skeletons and going through a cave that was entirely fake but fun.  We were through looking at it forty-five minutes before we were supposed to leave, we killed time by the door.  Judy had found out about this thing called a bug fest that was going on, and went to this bugtasting thing.  She brought a mealworm chocolate chip cookie that she wanted us to try.  Meg G. ate some crumbs, I ate a chocolate chip, and Kimbra ate a mealworm.  The cookie was drier than I'd like, but it sure was fun watching the look on Kimbra's face.  After that museum we went to an omnimax theater and watched this special on beavers that Sam was sure she'd hate.  Guess what, she didn't.  We all enjoyed the special if just because the effects were awesome and made you shut your eyes.
After that was lunch and then a trip into the history museum, which was totally awesome.  We took a trip into Cincinnati's past with models of what it used to look like, and then we got to play with some riverboats, using them to transfer goods up and down the river.  But it was missing quite a few blocks and Meg G., Sam, and I made a list of them, and the fact that some kida had shoved some blocks into the covered bridge and that we had gotten them out and that the first lock (canal) was broken.  Then we got to go into this town where there were real people we could talk to.  This town was set in the times after the Potato Famine and the stores had signs that read ""no Irish need apply"" so I put up my best Irish accent and Meg G. and I both told the dockman that we couldn't get jobs here, because of the signs and he told us he needed a couple deckhands for a trip down to New Orleans the next day.  After we left that museum we all went into the gift shop, where I picked up a cute little white tiger cub, and then we went into an ice cream shop for a sweet treat, and we decided to name my cub Lightning.  Then more photo ops and then back to the inn, where we eventually decided to stay for the night, after we grab some dinner.
Dinner was grabbed at this place that was decidedly almost completely out of our budget.  We all kanoodled around until we found some things that were within the budget.  Dinner, other than that difficulty and some sisterly rabbling that Kaycee inlficted upon Meg G., was pretty good.  After that, it was back to the room where Kelly, Sam, Meg G., and I started watching a movie that Judy interrupted at the crucial last half hour, focring us to attempt to sleep.

Sunday--same morning routine, this time packing and then heading off to the zoo.  We got there a little before eleven, splitting off into our groups and were off, with a little over an hour to ourselves.  we saw the nocturnal house, the cat house (smelly), and some big cats before Sam ran off into a boomerang show.  After that we wandered around a bit more, ready for lunch long before lunch time.  After a disappointing trip to see the white lions (they aren't very white at all) and the wolf woods (didn't see a single one) we carefully made our way to the lunch meeting place, Meg G. doing her best to support me, my foot making it nearly impoosible to walk.
We ate lunch at a Burger King inside the zoo, during which Sharon got a wheelchair (six bucks?) for me to get pushed around in.  It was kinda fun at first, even though Sam didn't drive well, but after a while, I kinda started feeling burdensome again.  Then, the terrible thing.  We were having some fun on our way to the Vanishing Giants exhibit and saw a pigeon on our way to a Gazebo to take some shade under.  We chased it.  It flew up and into a fan.  And died.  Meg G. was crushed, but Sam seemed to enjoy it, even if it was the standard laughing reflex some people have.  All that did was make Meg G. really upset, and as we went under the other gazebo she started bawling.  I got up and held her until she felt better, and Sam did the same once she stopped laughing.  Meg G. blamed herself for the pigeon's death because we chased it under the gazebo, not knowing there was a fan in there.  After seeing a few more exhibits, we went to the gift shop, where I bought a new deck of playing cards, with big cats on them.  Then we met up with the troop and watched the wings of wonder show at three.  After which we left the zoo and started the long drive home.
We stopped at plainfield for dinner, where we ate at Golden Corral, the second time we proved Sam wrong about her thoughts, being she thought she wouldn't find a thing here and she found a lot of goodies, especially the rolls.  After that, we had to make a quick stop because of a small bladder and we split cars a different way and one went to Linton to drop me off.  Sam, Becca, Leslie and Judy Gaul and Kelly and Sharon Mayo all saw my house.  After they left we watched an Asterix movie and Jim set out on a project of his for me and I went to bed.

Monday--Thought I was going to go home, didn't happen that way, since Jim's project wasn't quite over yet.

Tuesday--Mom took me back, buying me lots of goodies and complaining all the time about it.  I didn't mind that she was giving me all this cooking stuff, but she made me like she didn't think I was quite wirthy of it, because she kept acting as if she shouldn't do it, as if I wasn't worth the time, as if I were a burden.  Again.  Mom didn't make it in time to take me to the Food Stamp office so she stayed the night.

Wednesday--After fixing Mom and I some breakfast, we went looking another job for me.  After listening to Mom complain, I jotted down a couple of numbers.  Then it was off to look for the Food Stamp office.  It wasn't where Mom thought it was and so we had to do a little searching.  After Mom finally found it, we went in.  The lady said that student couldn't get food stamps unless they worked twenty hours or more, which Mom found infuriating, and let me know so for two solid minutes every time the topic came up.  After finding out I wasn't takig classes, they let me fill out the stupid form and I was on my way.  We went to the library and I got a card, then we went to Rax.  Dissapointingly I didn't eat as much as I'd hoped I would and I had to see that angry look in my mom's eye when I threw away some food.  If there's one thing I hate, it's going somewhere knowing you're hungry only to find out you can't eat.  A little while later Mom left, and Ruthie and I went shopping, first to Goodwill, where we did not find what we were looking for, then to Wal-Mart, to fill out a shopping list.  After that, it was back to the apartment where I was alone at last.  I watched a movie while I ate and then moved my comp. into my room, watched a movie and went to bed."

"event","So I'm locked out of my bedroom, not cool, I wonder when Kierstan'll unlock the door, and then I can tell her how I don't like being locked out of my own stinking bedroom!  *deep breath* I wonder what leads a girl to lock another out of their own bedroom, or if it had something to dso with me being upset last night, I could've locked her out, thought about it too, but I didn't, and that kinda shows the differences between us.  I mean, sometimes I get so mad at her I wish they'd kick her out, but I hold my tongue.  I generally try different ways to get my point across than yelling, now, that is.  And I don't resort to locking people out, however much I might appreciate the idea.  I'm trying to get my anger out in more constructive manners.  Okay, news update, I asked Kierstan why she locked me out, she said the dorr kept getting stuck, and that she didn't do it on purpose.  I can't believe that the doorknob not turning has nothing to do with a lock, especially as the first time she did it, the door wasn't shut all the way and I saw the lock...tut tut girl, try better next time.  What with the locking me out and the sleepovers and the coiniciding breaking of open house, and the pyros we had here last night, whoever let them in, my night wasn't the most pleasant.  And what's with everybody asking me if I have a boyfriend?!?  What's that got to do with anything?!  I went to bed at eleven, and couldn't sleep until nearly one, maybe after, I don't know, but it wasn't pleasant I can tell you that much.  Anyhow, I'm still kinda tired, and the rain isn't doing anything to help, cannot go to sleep, or won't be able to later.  Plus, my wrist hurts, darn developing arthritis...I should stop typing so quickly, that's not going to help me at all, I should go read, yes, that should help a little, yeah."

"event","I never used to think of myself as depressed, but it seems I might be.  I have trouble sleeping, loss of appetite, I'm always sad, according to my psych notes, I'm depressed.  Not as depressed as some people I know, I think, but depressed still the same.  And I think my headaches might have two causes, besides the TV, stress, according to a health website, or this plug-in air freshener thingy that Kierstan bought, that smells horrible.  It's kinda refreshing to have a logical explanation for some things that've been going on, but that doesn't mean I know what to do next, cuz I don't.  I never do.  I take things one thing at a time, and at this time it's worrying about this possible new tooth I'm getting in the upper right-hand corner of my mouth and worrying about what to do about the roomies.  I could get both of them kicked out at a moment's notice if I so choose.  All I know now is that they're my polar opposites and that they couldn't care less about leaving my things alone.  Chonda cooked with my sauce pan and it's still dirty and Kierstan's boyfriend used my cereal bowl and spoon and they're still lying there in othe sink--dirty. Right now they're refreshingly not here, which gives me the chance to listen to my own music, not have the TV on, tear that darn air freshener out of the wall, and not have to deal with any guy I do not wish to deal with.   I talked to the RA, she's going to talk to them or us about the boy thing, hope that goes well.  And work was interesting today, with me doing all the heavy-lifting and ""never having worked in a cafeteria before"" though I have.  It was a SOAR luncheon thing, had all the students and later their parents came in.  went from ten to two-fifteen today, came home to an empty apartment, which didn't seem to bother me this time read a little, ripped a few CDs, ate, and I'm just wasting time, whiling away the hours, wondering when I'll get an awesome visit from an awesome person who I miss so incredibly much.  These girls are just around when they're here, neither friendly nor mean-spirited.  And it's been raining nearly everyday, which makes it hard for me to even go around the building to visit JJ, where I'll merely end up spending time watching her goggle cute actors on the internet.  I'm ending up doing even less than I usually do during the summer, when I'm not working, just sitting around reading a book.  At least the last couple summers I would sometimes actually have somebody to visit.  I'd visit Katherine, but I still don't know that I'm quite ready fro that kind of driving.  And I'll have to find a church to attend this summer too, that'll be fun.  I'm still thinking of what I want to do tomorrow...I know I'm probably not going anywhere next Sunday, I can most probably expect a very late night the night before, too late to expect to get up early and drive, mmm-mmm...I'm gonna do something else now...I'll work on this again later, when I feel more up to it."

"event","It's summer, huh? I should be happy, shouldn't I?  I'm not, I'm all alone, and pathetically sad.  I just met Chonda (pronounced Shaunda)and I don't think she likes me.  I don't know about the other roomie person, haven't met her and she hasn't brought her stuff in.  I'm still in Rice, waiting for my parents to come out tomorrow, and I can't wait cuz when they come I won't be alone.  There's absolutely not a soul here and when I talk, it echoes, and it makes me want to cry because I feel like I'm in a bubble, and I have a headache from watching TV on my computer, and I don't feel like doing anything.  The only difference between this summer and all the rest right now is that I have no family anymore, I don't have anybody right now, all the people I want to talk to aren't on right now and I feel so unbelievably isolated from anything and everything.  JJ's not in her apartment, new or old that I can see and so there's nobody, nobody *sniff* nobody to talk to, nobody to annoy, and nobody to make smile or make me smile.  I'm not smiling, I'm too sad to smile *sniff* I'm here, in my room, nobody but me and the fish, crying, wishing somebody were here, and wishing I weren't here. Alone.  I'm so pathetic, a lot of people would kill to be isolated, and all I can do is wish Katherine were here, but she's not, she's out, and I can't even bug her over the computer.  I'm sit of sitting here, but there's absolutely nothing to do till my parents get here tomorrow *sob* once they get here I'll be somewhere where some people are.  Right now even that stupid apartment is depressing, because no one's there, and because Chonda's taken up residence, supposedly, in the room I wanted soo much, and even both computere desks that are in there.  There's nothing to do and no one to talk to and I wish there was someone to take this loneliness away, but there isn't, there isn't.  I'm just here.  Alone.  Pathetically upset and wishing it were June first, so I could go hang with the Girl Scouts in Cincy...and then that the school year were here, so Katherine could come back and I would be alone...but that's impossible.  And I jsut found out today that Mother's Day is coming up and I ain't got her nothing and that sure doesn't help the situation.

I've been alone since Sunday afternoon, and yet it feels like it's been weeks, and that I should be gone by now, and all I have to eat is mac 'n' cheese and CoCo Wheats...Krystle gave me her Easy Mac packets, and they taste horrible!  Not to mention I'm sick of mac 'n' cheese in all forms right now, I want Spaghettio's or Something from some restaurant, but not Rax or Arby's right now, I don't feel like Roast Beef, and I gotta find something to do with all this chocolate...maybe if I had the Magic Bullet I could chop it all up and make a milkshake outta it, except I have no Magic Bullet...and no people...and darn it!  I hate it!  I hate being the only person around!  Even when I isolated myself in my bedroom, I always knew I wasn't alone, because I could always here or feel people, right now all I hear is music and all I feel is loneliness..."

"event","I got this new therapist now, since my old one can't sit, walk, stand, etc., and can't come to school now.  And even when she does come back, she won't be able to be a therapist anymore.  My new therapist kept asking me all these weird questions that I have no clue how they even relate to how I'm doing.  She said she was trying to figure out the state of my emotions or something like that.  Weird, if you ask me, and I'm pretty sure she thinks I'm depressed now, cuz I was like, ""Yeah, I'm pretty much sad all the time, even when I'm around Katherine, the sadness is still there, at the back of my mind.""  That and other things, take sforever to go to sleep, have no appetite, things like that.  I wonder what it'll be like this fall, the next time I'll get to see her.

And on top of that, my roommate threw this humungus one-man anger party Monday when I put in a movie that wasn't hers.  She may be over it by now but...I don't know really.  It still kinda burns on me that by title, she listed the movie as ""stupid"" and wouldn't even stay in the same room as it, and she throws this humungus rant on her internet website over people trying to change her, like looks and things, and listed me as a problem friend, or as such, one of those people who know nothing about her and talk about their friends behind their backs.  And, while doing this, she's ranting to her friend about the stinkin' movie! Make any sense to you?  And if we wanna get on not cool, she didn't even make it ten minutes in bed with the lights on, but I have to deal with it fore an hour, give or take, when I go to bed early, but now this is starting to hurt my eyes a bit, and I'm constantly afraid she's going to read this thing and hate me for another whole stinking day, like she did over a menial movie!  Wow! Can anybody say grudge?  It's just a movie, if it bothers you so much, ask me to turn it off! Hello! Yeah, I'm hanging onto that for a little too long, but this'll help, yes it will, that and staying on campus for the summer!! Woot!! No staying at home for me!! Hooray!! I love staying here, it makes me happy, but I can hardly wait for school to start again, because soon, I will be Katherine deprived.

Oh, and you know?  The therapist lady gave me her number, so she can recommend me to this guy over the summer, in case I need help...twenty-five dollars a session?!?  I can't pay that now!! Heck no!!  If worse comes to worst, I got Katherine and Hope to call, whose cell phone numbers I forgot and never knew, respectively.  I told her I can't pay that, but she insisted, so now I have her number to call if I happen to have a mental breakdown or something over the summer (let's hope not!).  And the whole time she's writing it down I'm thinking 'Why call this guy when I cannot pay, when I can call my best friend(s) and get better therapy for free?'  Yeah, that has been my week as far as I know right now, I'm distracted by moving and slight sighing in the far corner of the room...

The Spring Fling was fun, coulda been a little better, if one were to not make fun of the rides, you know?  The school never called it a carnival, I did, don't know why, but I did, and someone was complaining about how pitiful the school's excuse for a carnival was.  I enjoyed it, that's what counts, I don't appreciate people making fun of menial details like that, when they should be having fun.  It puts a damper on things.  Dampers make me sad.

My new word, it seems: Happy.  For some reason, I've been using that word a lot, and I don't know why.  Could be because I wish I were, I don't know.  I prefer not to think about things like this, not when I can help it.  It makes things seem far too complicated.

Yeah, I think I'm good for now...bedtime everybody!!!"

I'm such an idiot! Everyone's having fun and I want to to!  But no one ever lets me in on that stuff, at least, that's how it feels now, because Hope invited me to chill a little earlier today, but in this mindset, I almost forget this, as I'm thinking how it feels like no one on this floor cares about me enough to invite me to do something.  It was the same with the last floor, no one invited me to anything, am I just not that fun!  Or am I blind to something, or is it just me, or them, or that we just don't mix?  Do I mix with anyone?  Or do I just feel something that just plain isn't there?  It feels like I drive everyone away.  Of course, so does my roommate, and she still gets more attention than I.  What is it with me that no one my age ever feels obliged to invite me to have fun?!?  I've never gotten an invitation to a sleepover, I've stayed at people's houses before, but never been to a sleepover.  My family had a New Year's Party at my Uncle Mikey's house once.  I spent the entire night with the adults because Cousin Chelle had her own friends over and didn't want to do anything with me.  Right now, at least, it feels like no one likes me or wants to do anything with me, it makes me want to watch the Chronicles of Narnia, except that would infuriate my roommate, wherever she is...I don't want that.  I almost just want to lie down somewhere and hide, or go for a walk, or hide away just to cry and make people feel sorry for me...NO!!!! DON'T DO THAT!!!! IDIOT!!!! It won't work, and neither will talking to people, you just don't mesh with these people, and exposing yourself to them isn't going to help, because...they...just...don't...care...right, yeah, that's right, these people here, on my floor, couldn't care less...that's why they give you leftover food, and chocolate, and...and...all know your name and yet know nothing about you...how do they know my name? I've no clue who they are!  They know nothing about me, and they don't want to.  THe very look of me is enough to let them know they don't want to know me...that's why no one wants to do anything with me, that's why they leave me out, leave me to suffer while they have fun...whatever."

So, just as I thought, that wonderful sight gave me a short night terror, and it had a wonderful little dream-thing of nearly everyone I knew undressing in front of me and it was not pleasant.  And I shook and shivered and was panting in terror and I opened my eyes and shut them and did my utmost best to think of SOMETHING ELSE!!!!!!! After a few minutes it worked and I managed to get some sleep eventually, and I ended up sleeping straight through my roommate going to bed, and it was solid until 6:30, and then I got some more until 8:00, as if that interests you.  But I needed to write that down and I need to hope that I can go to the bathroom with the door being shut and not being afraid.  I'll get over it eventually, I'm sure.  And Katherine left without saying goodbye.  I didn't even know she'd left until Josh signed on and off in his strange manner.  It kinda stung.  Especially since we'd just been talking about how we both were going to give Alicia some Eater chocolate...oh well.  I'm sure there was some sort of reason behind it.  I'm kinda over it now, especially since I'm getting so much homework done now, but it's lonely doing homework all by myself like this.  But that's the way it goes, it shoulda been done by now anyway, but since I have the time, I need to go finish it right now, having wasted the day playing around outside with my somewhat pushy roommate, I didn't mind it, but I had planned on spending the day reading, but there's no saying no to my roommate, psh! I need to work on that, off I go now..."

So I'm sleeping on Katherine's floor, her, Alicia, and I, then I get this feeling of absolute terror and I start shaking and hypervenitilating, and Alicia and Katherine are talking, and I get this feeling like someone's wrapping their arm around my side and I flip, and start shaking harder, and I start wondering if anyone's noticed, I can kinda hear what they're saying, but not really and the feeling comes again, and I spaz again, and again, and again, then Katherine gets up, and I look at her, she's leaving the room or something, and I'm looking at her, but I'm still seeing the night terror as it overlaps my sight, so I close my eyes again and the terror comes back, and I turn over, listening to Katherine tell Alicia that she's safe, I start feeling like maybe she's talking to me too, and the terror slowly subsides, and a few moments later I attempt to sleep again, only to have the terrors come back, only a little less intense, during one, I'm also looking at Katherine as she comforts Alicia, she seems to have seen me, but she's stretched her hand out to me, she reaches out to me, I take the hand, just as the terror comes back, so while I'm seizing with terror, I squeeze Katherine's hand, and she squeezes back, so I know she's there, and the terrors subside, but the worst was yet to come, while Alicia was talking, a terror slipped over me and I'm in the basement, where it all happened, and I'm in the basement bathroom, where the worst of it happened, and it's happening again, I seize with the worst terror I've yet felt, and I hear Alicia talking to Katherine and I hear Alicia ask about Katherine's glow-in-the-dark retainer, apparently she went and found it, and made it glow, what she did with it, I wish I could have opened my eyes to see, but it wasn't possible, and I feel Katherine hugging me and trying to soothe me, but it isn't working, and that feeling doesn't help, and I am continuously seized with this immense feeling of terror, and then Katherine finds my hand, and is squeezing my hand again, and after a while, the terror starts to fade again, it's now getting on seven o'clock in the morning, and I haven't had any decent sleep yet, but somehow, I manage to finally fall asleep, on Katherine's shoulder and gripping her hand.

Last night I had a few more nightmares, which were there in-between the terrors, and another terror, a short one, a small one, but a terror still, but gripping my squishy pillow and blanket, I manage to fight my way through.  These are just starting, and I can't wait till I've waded through all this."

"event","Amie, as far as I've known, has been an extension of myself.  When I dream, I'm either her, or myself, grieviously wounded.  Amie is a winged vampire, homeless, once friendless.  She now has an adopted son. named Charlie; a winged horse, Peggy; two white wolves, Wolf and Lyka; and a falcon, named Hardcore.  These are her friends, the only family She's had.

Whenever I sleep, I think of her, she is my escape from my sad sad world.  I use her to beat out all my difficulties.  If someone made me upset that day, Amie made them feel sorry for it.  If someone made me sad, Amie made me feel better.  She was my cure-all for upsetting events in life, and there were a lot, trust me, there were tons of things that made me feel like crap when I was younger, I longed for sleep because only when I was asleep was I not hopeless.

Amie was everything I was:  alone, without a close family, without friends, without a home.  She was also everything I wanted to be: free, strong, not going to let others walk all over her.  She always let people know who they were talking to, that being someone with power, she had power and she wasn't afraid to use it, not like me.  I'm afraid to use what I have, whatever it is.  I'm afraid of confrontations, afraid of making people upset, afraid of knowing people are upset with me, afraid of what'll happen if people are upset with me.

I'm just plain afraid, and that, especially, scares me.  I'm afraid of...getting hurt, that happens a lot, I know, but I'm afraid of it.  Not scratches or cuts, no, I'm afraid of the kind of hurt that cuts your heart, not your skin.  My heart has been cut so many stinking times, it doesn't need it anymore, it's gonna happen, yes, just don't want any more of it, I hate being hurt like this, but it happens so much, I'm afraid of what'll happen if it just plain stops hurting, if that means I'm used to it, or if I've stopped feeling.  That thought scares me more than anything so far.

Amie, though scared, faces through everything with incredible zeal.  I guess I wish I could be more like her, and less a small reflection of what I used to be, that which I can barely remember.  I had my innocence robbed, as Amie had hers robbed, similar, yet different.  I died inside when I found out what was going on, and Amie died inside, as she found out what she'd just done.  After a time, neither of us had a home, some psycho took hers away, some psyhcos took mine away.  The same, yet different are we, so close I can taste it, yet so far away, I can barely see it.  She used to have two brothers, now only has one, I may have had two brothers, if my mom hadn't had a miscarriage, now I have only the one.  Her parents, two sets had died, the parents mine once were has died, who knows, maybe twice and I just didn't know it.  Amie has the wings to fly away, my heart has already taken flight, but to where, I don't know.

I'm just starting to see these parallels, they've come to life, as my life here has come to life.  I'm just starting to see what I couldn't before, being so close to what was there, and I'm starting to see much, much more than I once could.  My life is starting to come a little clear, some good, some bad, same as everyone else.  It's comforting to know that some things in my life are similar to those of others, whether I know them or not.  All my life, I've been different than everyone else, more so after I turned eleven.  Being different isn't bad, don't get me wrong, I don't think like that, it's just, after being different for so long, it's refreshing to not be so, for once in my life.

Amie is different, yes, because I am, and just like me, she's starting to realize she isn't as different as she thought she was to begin with.  Basically, it seems that everything that happened in Amie's life, figuratively speaking of course, happened in mine.  My life has been cut to tatters, and it seems nothing can mend it, but I keep working for that possibility, slim though it may seem.  I'm stubborn, guess I get that from my father, he and I got into an argument once, over whether their house was home, or the campus.  He couldn't see that I felt this was home because I don't have to deal with people who treat me like Jim tends to, and I have so many incredible friends that are family to me.  My family isn't just composed of relatives, it never has been, it's always been a mix of my relatives and my best and greatest friends.  My greatest friends are like the sisters I've never had, they fill a gap inside my heart that no one else can, nor can they see the incredible depth of this large hole.

My life, and consquently Amie's, has been difficult, and I'm sure the two of us will work it all out.  Amie is my dream, every single night I dream of her, and I may continue dreaming, possibly until I either finish her story or don't need her anymore.  And, while I would love to work all this out, I almost wish I will always have Amie to fall back on, for she is a lot of fun to fiddle with, put in different situations just to see what she will do.  Amie is my dream and, though I can neverbe like her, I'd like to see how close I can get."

"event","I don't remember too many specifics, but this is a wierd dream I had last night...
I was Amie, a winged vampire, and I was really hungry, so I bit my brother, but I took a little too much, and he fell unconcious.  So  I decided to take him to his room to sleep it off.  For some reason, he lived in Smith.  But it wasn't really Smith, it was incredibly ornate, with statues and paintings, large rugs and shields all standing around and hanging off the walls.  I had to be invisible in order to make it to his room before anybody saw me, they were out to get me, wanted to kill me, because I was dead, sorta.  Peggy, my winged horse was with me, and sometimes I was riding her, and sometimes just walking beside her, and my brother was thrown over my shoulder, wierd.  Whilst hiding in a room, this guy came to me, he could see me even though I was invisible.  He was an Angel.  Why he was there, I'll never know.  He was talking to me, but I don't know what he said.  I do know I didn't want him talking as loud as he was, the humans would hear him.  He said they couldn't because he was an Angel.  I remember I had to go up a lot of stairs in order to reach my destination.  As soon as I got there and put my brother down, I heard voices, try as I might to stay invisible, I'd tired myself out getting there, so I ran, out the window, it was big enough for Peggy, and we both made it out of there, but someone was chasing us along the ground.  The Angel came back, and he and I sort of melded together, and I became stronger, strong enough to fend off the guy on the ground, with a whip I didn't know I had.  Then I woke up.

Here's an older one, from a few days ago, wierd as the first one:

Again, I was Amie, the winged vampire, and my roommate, Alicia, Katherine, and I were in our room.  Katherine was sitting on my lap, (as we had earlier that day) reading each other's lj entries.  Katherine leaned back and stabbed herself in the back with my roommate's scissors (don't ask me how).  My roommate and Alicia freaked and Katherine nearly fainted in my arms.  I told Alicia to shut the door, which she did, and my roommate to move, which she did.  I lay Katherine on her stomach on the floor and cut my wrist.  Alicia grimaced.  My roommate stared, stupefied.  I healed Katherine's wound with my blood (which has healing propoerties like you wouldn't believe) and helped her stand up again.  She stood up shakily, and I supported her.  Suddenly she looked at me, ""I can breathe!"" She practically yelled.  And she demonstrated, taking deep breaths, no whistling involved.  My roommate looked at me and yelled, ""Why didn't you tell me you were a vampire?""  I had no answer, so I shrugged.  ""I don't know, but just like you said earlier 'a human in on the secret makes it much more interesting' but none of you can tell a soul, or I will be forced to kill you.  Got it?""  Everyone nodded.  Then I was awakened."

"event","Katherine has been one of the greatest things to ever happen to me in my entire existence.  It was she who started the long process of the healing of my heart.  She met me because she was lonely and talking to her friend Alicia.  Walking by my room, she saw me, sitting alone doing my hw, with no other name on my door--I had no roommate.  Seeing me, all alone, she offered up her friendship to me, and stuck with it, too.  She has done so much to help me, from bringing me up when I'm pitying or degrading myself to showing me my bad points and helping me find better ways to do things.  She's so similar to me, it's almost scary.  We have similar interests, similar experiences at school, similar ways of going about things, and more I can't even think of at the moment.  Katherine is like my right hand, or left one, since I write with that one.  When it's gone, I'm sad, when it's there, it's like I'm complete.  Even when something Katherine said hurt me, or I feel like I've said something to hurt her, I'd rather have her by my side than have her be mad at me and go off by herself.

It was Katherine that convinced me I needed to get into therapy.  And now that I'm in it, I tell her basically everything that goes on in therapy.  She's one of those people you feel like to can tell just about everything to, and it'll only make her love you more.  Katherine has supported me through the worst things that have happened to me during college, and I know she'll be there for me forever, whether we're rooming together, like next year, down the street from each other, wouldn't that be awesome! Or miles away, the sad truth of reality.  Katherine has been the light to my darkness.  The things I thought were unique to my family, she proved me wrong, things I thought everyone did, she proved me wrong on as well, she has shown me what real family is, like, I always knew that your family wasn't just your relatives, but my friends weren't really my family until I met Katherine.  She has proved more real  to me than any other friend I've ever had.  She loves me more than others have, and I her.  We're like sisters, the close ones, the ones that don't easily get tired of each other, the kind of sister I'd always wished I could have.  The kind of sister I can sit up with, crying and still want to talk about it the next day.

Like, last night, I found out my brother hurt my best friend at home, and she didn't want anyone to know about it, so anyone reading this is sworn to secrecy, and I won't mention names.  In finding out what he did to her, I nearly started crying, I was so incredibly hurt and grossed out.  I kept feeling like telling Katherine, even though she asked me not to, but I knew I was in for a hard night if I didn't, so I told her that I knew I was going to have nightmares that night, and I did, and she asked me why, we had our webcams on, and I told her to look at my face, that I'd found out that my brother'd hurt my friend.  Typing this, I really did start crying.  She immediately asked if I wanted her to come over, I said please.  I watched her get off the phone, put her away message up, and come over immediately.  I tried to stifle my sobs as I waited for her to arrive, but it didn't quite work.  However, my roommate made no move to find out what was wrong.  Katherine showed up, and I hugged her immediately.  Then we sat down and I showed her the conversation I was having with my other friend, and we sat up for a whole hour, talking, while I calmed down, and we went our separate ways, after another long hug.

Getting into bed was hard for me.  I knew as soon as I closed my eyes that images of what my brother did to my friend would flash through my head, and they did.  Shaking that off, I stayed awake for another half hour to hour, and tried to think of something else.  Katherine was there for me, and that means tons.  Whenever we're together, we have some of the greatest conversations, and she always keeps me cheery, even when I don't wanna be, which isn't very often.  It's a great wonder to me that Katherine has come into my life, she's turned my world upside-down, and in the best way possible.  I know I can always count on her, that she'll always be there for me, and in the best way possible, even when it isn't the way I want, like getting on me for my hw, I don't always enjoy it, but I know it's in my best interests that she does this, so I bear it, I bear it along with all the other weights on my heart, which nearly mirrors the weights on Katherine's heart, and both of us try to take on some of the other's weights, to the best of our abilities, whether the other likes it or not.  But we're stuck with each other ;) and we like it.  And I wanna thank Katherine from the bottom of my heart for talking to the lonely girl in 234C and there's no way on Earth that I can give back to Katherine for all she's done for me, but I'm gonna do the best I can, and I hope that's good enough.

Katherine's a cheery person, always has a smile for me, and that makes the world a little brighter, when I need it, which I always do.  She does little dances all the time, which almost never fail to make me laugh.  She makes funny faces, and always wants to get a smile out of me, and she rarely fails.  She has this look about her, this light, and I try to keep that light from dimming under her heavy load.  I always look forward to our time together, and never seem to tire of hearing her talk.  My small universe was dark when I came to college.  Dark with a sad, painful past, and thoughts that I'd never be whole again.  Katherine showed me wrong once again, and shed a small light on my world.  And so the old hymn says: ""It only takes a spark, to get a fire going, and soon all those around, can warm up in its glowing...""  She sparked my interest in finding new ways to cope with my past i.e. therapy, and now I'm fanning that spark, and hope to be whole again sometime, e'en if it takes me many many years, I will do my best to start unraveling that thorn vine around my heart...someday.  And whene'er that day comes, I will be the happiest person I know, besides Katherine.

Yeah, there's a lot to Katherine.  Just like there's a lot to me, only her past is happier than mine.  She doesn't have the same past as me, and not only can she still love me, she can try her best to empathize with me, which makes me respect her like I've respected no one in my life.  She's my best friend, and I love her so, so much, and I know she loves me.  And to quote another great song, which describes this just as well, ""And they'll know we are Christians by our love, by our love, and they'll know we are Christians by our love.""

The end. :)"

"event","They're back.  I hoped and hoped beyond all hopes that they'd never com back.  I was wrong.  I took a nap yesterday afternoon because I was exhausted.  I had a dream--a memory dream.  There was THAT BOY, and there was me, and he was ""telling me all the reasons he'd hurt me"" while hurting me, again.  I never wanted to see his face again, and there it was, the reason I don't want to go home.  Oh why couldn't he grow up and move away so I never have to see his face, I sometimes wish I'd never been born, or that I'd been born into another family, just so I'd never have to have met him, and then I feel ashamed because I know what my daddy'd say to that, and above all things I never want to disappoint my daddy, but sometimes I feel like I do  it everyday, I mean, I do it to my mom plenty, but she's different.  You can disappoint her horribly by simply leaving a cupboard door open, but I'm getting off track.  I spoke to Katherine about that dream, without telling her what happened in it.  She wants me to get counseling.  But I'm afraid of what'll happen if I do that.  So I suffer in silence, as always, using music and books to try to drown out the screams I hear inside.  It took me a long time to go to sleep last night.  Every time I closed my eyes, there was another picture, this time real.  Me pinned against the bathroom wall, I could feel what happened every time they did that to me before, them playing video games with me, and what I'd had to do then, them watching TV, and what I did then, I could feel it like I was still an impressionable eleven-year-old again.  And it hurt, and I was afraid my roommate'd still be awake and hear me lashing out as I awoke, or hear me hyperventilating from how much those memories hurt, or, or, or, how I wish I were someone else!  Someone who didn't have this burden that lays on my heart still.  Then there's Lora, she's no problem really, just seems to have some empathy issues, but those I can deal with.  It's how much I hurt, and how much I see others hurting, and how there's absolutely nothing I can do to help them, without dealing with my own pain first, which seems the only way to be of use to anybody, even my own best friends.  I'm never the friend I should be; I see that clearly, I keep on hurting my friends.  Without realizing what I do or say, I hurt my friends for absolutely no reason, and I think it's because of the injury that lies there, still festering on my heart.  I don't know what to do with it, but the best I can do right now, is talk to God about it and Katherine, though I don't want to bother her too much, simply because she's always swamped with hw, her heart's in the right place too.  When I feel I can, I'll talk to her about...everything, everything I can manage."

"event","I seem to always hurt  those people who are around me.  I wish I knew what is was about me that always hurts people.  I was snapped at today.  It was apologized for, which helped, but the fact was, she was right.  I spent a lot of the rest of chapel looking at all the people below me.  A lot of them seemed really into the service, and I wondered why I was never like that during those songs.  The songs touched me, and I almost cried, one because the songs touched my already sad heart, and two the speaker kept talking about me, though he didn't know it, and it hurt me, to hear those stories, similar to my own.  I wanted to get up, to run somewhere else, I didn't want to listen, I was praying a little, during the last song, and then my wrist hurt so bad, I almost hyperventilated from breathing so hard.  Katherine was so quiet during the rest of the service, I almost wondered if I'd hurt her, she spoke to me about a lady I used to watch downstairs, she was signing to the sing, I didn't say anything, I just shook my head.  I was praying, then she pointed the lady out to me, and I mentioned that I'd seen her.  Later, I looked at Katherine, but she looked almost asleep.  The speaker's topic was so difficult to hear, but it was too dark to read, and I hate sleeping in Chapel, I tired to immerse myself in thoughts, but the speaker's stories kept engrossing me, sad as they were...I sometimes seem to myself to be one of the most selfish creatures on the planet, wanting things for myself, things I know I can't have.  So while I thought on it during that last song, I prayed about it.  You see, the band wanted us to sing that our hearts be broken, but I didn't want my heart broken again, it hurts far too much.  Instead I prayed that God do whatever He feels He needs to do in order for me to be what He wants me to.  

Selfish me example, Katherine was concerned for Hope, who was having a bad time of it.  I assumed that's where her attention was while I was hyperventilating on her other side.  I was half expecting her to grab my arm or something if she'd noticed, and was disappointed when nothing happened.  my roommate, however, asked me what I'd done.  After a little bit, Katherine had mentioned that Hope was having a bad time over there.  I looked, and lo and behold, she's shaking like nobody's business.  I wanted to look concerned, I mean I was, but the pain hadn't quite subsided enough for me to have anything other than a look of pain and for me to be able to say much.  On top of that, I was getting a little dizzy again, so the entire time we were leaving, I was hanging on to one thing or another, or running into people, which happened a lot on our way to the MP.  Tears that had surfaced on my eyes during the service were freezing my face, and I said nothing the entire way to the MP, which I wonder what Katherine was thinking, I wasn't upset or anything, I was half-expecting her to ask me about it, but she didn't, but I wasn't disappointed this time; it didn't really matter.  She mentioned her concern for Hope, and I would've as well, but I was concentrating on placing my feet in the right spot.  I realized I had my old high school face on, I face that was supposed to look expressionless, but I later found out it was either an angry face or a sad face.  I think that I kinda looked mad, but I hadn't meant to.

During the speaker's prayer, I had a bad memory flash.  Darn that those things aren't gone.  I don't suppose they ever will be.  Those memories can be a horrible thing, as they just pop up at the worst moments, they disrupt my daily living.  Sometimes, when they come, I have to grab something, close my eyes, and quickly try to think of something else, I usually end up with my fist in my face, or a dazed look on my face, and I hate it!  I hate revisiting those days while I'm trying to forget it again, but I suppose that's impossible too...I've realized that a lot of the secular music I listen to has lyrics that mention being alone, or how everybody hates me, or something similar to that, and that it helps me deal with the fact that that's how I used to be in school.  Huh, amazing what one realizes sometimes, it's not that I like depressing music, or Gothic music, which is what a lot of it can be classified as, it's just that music that brings back my past helps me see how very different it sometimes seems here."

"event","I sometimes have wished I didn't need people around as much as I do, then I read something that reminds me that isn't always a bad thing.  I've always wanted to be able to get out and meet people, and I have, here at school, but in my younger days, that was a bad thing for me, for the kids at school poisoned their minds with bad thoughts of me, and I always ended up getting hurt.  So I've ended up gaining these bads thoughts of people and, horrible as it sounds, they're still there.  I'm an idiot, always wondering that, if I tell something something, they tell other people, making it sound totally horrible.  I always end up waiting for someone to confront me, tell me how horrible I sound.  There are times when, if I had superpowers, I'd want them to be mind reading, or supersonic hearing, so I can tell when someone's talking about me.  I hate feeling this way, but I do that sometimes, even to my very best of friends, I end up waiting for them to disappoint me.  But here, at school, they haven't yet, and I'm so incredibly glad for that, for finally finding the kind of friends that not even my sad past can destroy.

Those kids at PGS have destroyed my mind so terribly that I sometimes end up totally destroying myself.  I can't let them do this to me anymore!  They'd make me feel like I can't do anything, and even my mother sometimes gives the impression that only she can do things right at the house, when they were fine to begin with.  Sometimes she makes it so miserable that I just want to get out and scream till I get laryngitis or make myself deaf so I can't hear her complaining.  I know she isn't always that bad, but the bad memories tend to make the good ones disappear in the limelight.  I feel that if I write all my old bad feelings in here, everyone who reads it will hate me for life, there're so many of them.  But I might someday, just to get them out.

My brother I know, sadly, would merit quite a few of those.  I should be nicer to him.  Most of what he does his because of his ADD I know.  But besides all that, he just annoys me constantly, just to get me to yell at him, so I end up getting in trouble.  Plus, no matter how hard I try, I let him push my buttons to his heart's content.  I can't block him out of my mind no matter what I do.  And it's not the typical annoying brother either, he sometimes doesn't give me a moment to myself, he does nothing all day, excepting when he's at work of course.  He tends to act like a seven-year-old, which really gets on my nerves, he just bugs me.  Sometimes even hearing his voice sets me on nails.  And it doesn't help that I'm at college either.  He set my room phone to rocket dial on my phone at the house, so all he has to do is hit a button and he can call me, and he does.  He seriously just called once to tell me that Monk loses his memory in the next episode and gets filthy and can't remember.  Why tell me when it can't mean anything to me? I can't just sit around and watch TV like every at home does!  What's on TV means nothing to me! Just grow up and leave me alone Brother!  Whew! That feels better.  Oh well, I can't help who he is, I'll just have to learn to deal with my brother and the way he does things.

My father is probably the closest person to me in the entire family.  I can tell him basically anything and he will help me in any way possible.  No matter what happens to me, I know Daddy will be there for me and do anything possible to make what happens easy for me.  Daddy understands how people work and in knowing that, he taught me some of what he knows, in order to help me through life."

"event","For the last eight years of my life, almost everyone around me has been doing its best to make my life miserable.  Everyone at school made me inferior to them.  I wasn't human, I was worse than last year's garbage that never got taken out.  They all, it seemed, made me feel like I wasn't worth the time to look at.  My own classmates told everyone around me so many lies, and of course they all belived them, everyone around me ""knew"" that I was sick, ""don't touch her, she has AIDS, if you touch her, you'll get it too.""  I was from another planet, ""Gee, Heather, what planet are you from?""  ""Earth.""  ""That's funny, you should be a comedian.""  They all got into it, almost 300 kids, the entire school except kindergarten and a select few others.  Everyone did my best to make sure I knew I wasn't anything at all.  For a while, I did my best to ignore, but the barbed arrows kept flying.  They broke through all my best defences, cutting through to my heart.  Even now, when people say or make me feel like something I said didn't matter, it cuts me, even if it's my best friends and I know they don't mean it that way.  My own best friends, I know you dn't mean it, but if you make me feel like You know more than I, it cuts me down.  I hate to say things like that, but its true.  I walked away from my friends tonight to cool off.   I was made inferior again tonight, believe it or not.  I guess it's cuz I'm sick that I took it so hard, but I was close to tears just sitting there.  I drank my Dr. Pepper so no one would look at me.  I've been the closest to crying I've been in years, my defences are down because I'm sick and tired.  Intrigueingly enough, I'm sick and tired of being inferior to everyone around me.  I hope I'm not that different from the others around me, but I know that I am!  My own floor hasn't invited me to a single floor get together!  I didn't even know my floor was doing all these things until the Christmas party!!  Can you imagine what it's like to go somewhere and find out you're on the outside again?  Just like it's been my entire life!!  I live on the outside, I'll never be on the inside of anything that goes on around me!!!  NEVER!!!!!  I hate the pity party attitude, but that's just the way it is, it'll never change.  There's mnothing I can do to change the fact that I'm not cool enough for my own floor.  They spent almost the entire time talking about how connected the floor was, but they don't even seem to know that there're other people on the floor, people that don't merit invites to cool get-togethers; I know I never merit those.

These people around me are so completely different from me that I mean little to them, a little banter here and there; help with this or that; that's all I'm good for.  I'm not even important enough to merit quiet time during quiet hours.  Not to mention I'm far too polite to just go up to people and say, ""Hey! I exist!""  In the middle of the night I'm far too polite to say, ""Hey!  Just shut up and let me sleep already!""  Admirable traits, huh?  My daddy says I'm sensitive, good for hwlping others with their feelings, bad for helping me with mine.  Just because I'm a preacher's daughter doesn't mean I'm just somebody that can be walked over, I never felt like I needed someone to make me feel like I'm important before now, I want my daddy!  He's the only person that ever made me feel like a true somebody.  He used to tell me a would be a heartbreaker someday.  I never thought it would happen.  But right now I'm breaking my own heart.  Crying silently in my room, dreading that anyone would hear me, yet hoping someone would.  I'm all alone in this world right now, I always have been, I never hated it until I got a taste of true friendship.

I hear people always telling other that they're never alone.  Well, they're wrong.  My daddy used to say that the place people are alone most is in a crowd; now that's true.  I'm surrounded by happy people right now, and it only makes me feel worse.  I was always surrounded by happy people, and was never with them, I sometimes, like now, feel I never will.  Whenever my friends leave my room, there's always a part of me that believes the happiness I had just felt, which had already dissipated, had been but a dream, that it had never happened, because now I'm alone again, always alone.  There's a part of me that knows I'll always be alone, never will another fill the void that grade school bullies left on me.  They think it did nothing to me, I put up a face everyday for school, everyday when I came home, I felt like I would burst from the very pain of going to school; it hurt so much,I knew one of these days I would crack, and I did, three times in four years I cracked.  By high school, I felt numb when I went to school.  There seemed nothing that would ever break the barrier I had put on my heart.  Guess again.  I would like to introduce you to my wallbreakers, a little thing I call friends.  Piece by piece my friends started tearing down my wall; it's getting dangerously close to the bottom I think, or I wouldn't be crying this very minute; I didn't think I could.  People say one thing and it sets to thinking.  All I ever wanted to do was change one person's life--say one cool phylisophical phrase and BOOM!!!  I change a life.  I looked at the snow drifts on the sides of the roads and remebered the fun I used to have one them, then I grew up--far too fast.  I remembered watching a movie, Don't Look Under the Bed, and wondered, would I have turned my Imaginary Friend into a Boogeyman, and what would she haved looked like if I did?

I know I grew up too fast; I never had a childhood, that was ruined by three creative people, who wanted to have a little fun--one at ten, and two at eleven.  Then those jerks at school, who never knew, decided to finish the job and make sure I never knew what free childhood was like.  For eight years I was forced to believe I was lower than those around me, even though I knew I wasn't, I knew I was, if that makes any sense.  I was absolutely nothing at this place.  Nothing.  Alone.  Garbage.

Don't try to tell me this isn't true, plenty of people have done there best to do that.  I can't believe it, not a word of it, from people who say that, while telling me they're smarter than me.  So many people act like they're smarter than me, and one of them is a new friend of mine, who, while saying that, proves it isn't true.  I hate shooting friends down, but sometimes my own confuse me; they have tendencies to try to prove they're smarter than I, while trying to be friendly with me.  So here's a note:  next time that happens, I won't be afraid to sit at another table, I'm sorry if I hurt you, but I can't take treatment like that anymore, and I hate face-to-face encounters; they hurt far too much, because I hate to read your faces, which I've gotten kind agood at at times, and one of the things I hate to look at most is pain; it reminds me so much of what I've gone through--so much pain.  Katherine, it hurts!!"

"event","The hardest thing I ever had to go through happened when I was eleven.  A couple of boys used to come to my house, friends of my brother.  I used to think they were cool, that it was okay to hang out with them.  I was wrong.  These boys found me a neat plaything.  Look, it's a little girl, let's see what we can make it do.  THey made me do all sorts of things, undress, hold their things while they played video games, stand facing the wall, feet spread while they did something with their things around my butt-hole, let them pretend to suckle, all sorts of things.  It made me feel bad, but I wasn't sure if it was wrong until the D.A.R.E. officer came to my fifth-grade class where a sexual assault video was shown to us.  I felt awful, I couldn't believe this was happening to me!  I told my mom and dad who told those boys to never, ever come back.  I later suppressed these memories, but they came back in high school, when a college decided to do something weird, all I know was I had to take a sexual assault survey, and learn about sexual abuse, sexual assault, date rape, all sorts of things like that, I didn't even want to hear or say those words and here I get a week of nothing but in my P.E. class.  People like me make up 25% of the female population--stats I didn't care to hear.  I didn't want to be there, but I had to.  Old memories came back, giving me nightmares again, making me exceedingly uncomfortable in that class.  I remembered Dad saying I shouldn't talk about what had happened, but what was I to do now?  During church camp I eventually broke down and told someone, after I had elicited an express promise that she never say a word to another soul.  I eventually started telling other people I knew I could trust, never details, just generals, like the mere fact that, hey, I was sexually assaulted by two guys I knew when I was eleven.  Gradually it started helping me feel better about myself, I started knowing I had had nothing to do with what happened, just that it had happened.  I still sometimes feel dirty, but I know I couldn't help it, it makes me kinda scared to get a boyfriend, but one day I figure I'll meet some sympathetic boy who will help finish healing this great gaping wound on my heart that didn't start healing until I came to college."

"event","I don't quite remember what order I lived in the towns I lived in, I'm going to throw the other towns in together.

I remember Newcastle, I lived in a large cul-de-sac type area, shared a room with my brother, had my first coffeecake, was given my first skates in a box from some lady, had a water balloon fight with some other kids, and developed my fear of the bottom bunk there.

I remember Milton next, I was five, six, and seven there.  I started preschool and I remember a girl, I think her name was Caroline.  Caroline tried to convince me she was only two, yet she could talk as good as any five-year-old. I was invited to her birthday party, but couldn't go because my bother started a food flinging fight and mine got on the wall, I never did find that food...  I found my first best friend in Kindergarten, I was in P.M. Kindergarten with a girl named Arin.  She taught me a few valuable life lessons while helping become a better person, I give my thanks to her.  I started Girl Scouts in Kindergarten with a troop being part of someone's Gold Award.  On the day we were having our Valentine's Party I was sick.  Arin and her mother baked me chocolate chip cookies and came over with my Valentine's, the cookies and a get-well card.  Next time she was sick, I came over with candy necklaces and  a card for her.  The breaker came during the middle of first grade, I was still best friends with Arin and another girl who's name escapes me and still in Girl Scouts, but now we had to move to Monroe City MO.

Monroe City, MO was okay.  It wasn't IN, but it wasn't too bad.  I still managed to have friends, no one was left out at that school.  I was still involved in GSUSA, but I missed Arin.  First Grade at R-1 Elementary was okay.  We had a girl once bring a baby deer they found at her horse farm to class, in Second Grade we made butter and Ice Cream, on separate days of course, in Third Grade our teacher had a ghost in her desk, we were allowed to grade other students papers, I stapled my forefinger, and had an argument with a boy about how Sunday is the first day of the week, not Monday,  I had a boy in my third grade class who had cerebral Palsy, I think, he was in a wheelchair, at least.  We also, later in the year, got a boy from Hawaii in class.  In fourth Grade my troop bridged into Juniors, we were allowed in the teacher's lounge for ice.  You see, we weren't allowed to wear shorts, so we were allowed to bring water bottles to class.  One PE teacher I had at R-1 Elementary was interesting.  If you told him you didn't feel well during warm-ups, he'd let you sit, but if they started playing one of your favorite games, if you told him you felt better, you could go play.  I found that rather strange.  During the middle of my Fourth Grade year at R-1, we moved again......during Christmas we packed, we moved out in time for New Year's.  My first days in Palestine weren't that difficult, but once school started, so did the trouble, which I'll save for next time, But I'll make an allowance for my worst experience in Monroe City: One time a girl visited my house and caused me to rethink my friendship with her.  I won't go into detail, because it's hard to recount, but suffice it to say, it was something no one should have to go through."

"event","This journal is going to start as if a life story, starting with my earliest memories.  I'm going to be blunt and rude in these things, I'm sure, so don't be offended by anything I say, got it?

My first clear memory, not fragmented was of a large pink building, a duplex, where we lived for a time.  I was three, I think.  We had one of those bathrooms that was divided in two rooms.  One had the sink, bathtub, and shower, the other, practically a closet, had the stool.  A window joined the two.  I, a curious three-year-old, decided to find out what was beyond that window while my seven-year-old brother was taking a bath.  My brother heard me and decided to yell at my parents that I was peeking, even though I had barely even touched the window.  I was standing on the back of the toilet seat hanging on to the books stacked on the window.  When he yelled, it startled me and I lost my balance and fell.  I hit the back of my head, the base of my skull, on the toilet paper dispenser, or so my mother says.  The books fell on my face.  My brother yelled that I was crying, my mother took me to the hospital for two stitches in the back of my head.  They were blue.  I remembered they looked like blue spiders when my parents took them out of my head.  Other things I remember at that house was once being carried up to my room as I had fallen partially asleep during TGIF, once waking up with so much sleep-stuff in my eyes that I could barely see, and a little girl down the street who tried to convince me her parents used poop instead of meatballs in spaghetti.  I ate dinner with them once.  We had spaghetti.  I used the bathroom and wasn't sure if I should flush the toilet or not, since I had done number two.  Oh the minds of these children...I don't remember much else from that house, and I wanna go to bed now."

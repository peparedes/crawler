""I like 'em proud""
""Ya gotta have a mother for me""

<a href=""http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/storm-of-anger-as-us-fails-its-own/2005/09/02/1125302738957.html"">Sydney Morning Herald article about New Orleans</a>

""Troops have been given shoot-to-kill orders in a bid to stop looting and restore law and order....As authorities only guess at a death toll - it could be in the thousands - there are reports of women and a young boy and girl being raped in the New Orleans Superdome, while other refugees there are terrorised by rioters....The Governor of Louisiana, Kathleen Blanco, said that troops were ""battle-tested"".

""They have M-16s and are locked and loaded. These troops know how to shoot and kill and I expect they will.""


I wish I didn't even have to suspect that this is pretty much a race issue. 
New Orleans, population 485,000, is 67.5 per cent black. I'm fairly sure they wouldn't be ordering the troops to ""shoot to kill"" in Wisconsin. 

I feel disgusted. 
Seriously considering moving back to London in a few weeks. I'm getting a bit sick of NYC and this fucking country in general. 
it's a shame that I never got to see New Orleans.  Anything they rebuild won't be the same city. 

In happier news, Loveless was a huge success last night, Paul worked on a catpower video yesterday and says that Chan (which is actually pronounced 'sean'?! who knew!) is getting portly, and I'm interviewing Adam Franklin from Swervedriver."

"event","We barely made it to the Ed Sullivan Theatre to pick up our tickets on time. The man who assigned our seating asked if we were excited, and even though I knew my level of enthusiasm would decide where I would be seated, I still replied ""uh, yeah"". I did smile though, and I thought maybe that would be enough. We wandered down to a shitty Times Square bar to waste the next fourty minutes until we had to return and were forced to stand on the street surrounded by masses of tourists chattering excitedly. One of the annoying ladies that worked there proceeded to hype the crowd up by getting everyone to cheer and other such irritating overly american antics. I asked Paul if he hated me and he replied in the affirmative. I realised very quickly by surveying the crowd that that we were going to be seated in the ""not very excitable"" section, ie. on the balcony. The ""Clappers"" as i so creatively named them were marched into the bottom section (and I kid you not) cheering and clapping the whole time. I wasn't sure if they were aware that the show hadn't actually started yet. 
The band came out, everyone clapped, paul schaffer and dave and all his other cohorts came out, everyone cheered and clapped. Some of the Clappers asked dave some annoying boring personal questions and then the show began.
Within the first ten minutes my hands started hurting from clapping and Paul looked like he wanted to die. 
The woman who flew the space shuttle came on and talked about intelligent things. The Clappers seemed confused. 
Then Richard Lewis came on. The first audible thing he said was ""flaccid penis"", which is a phrase you rarely hear on television. He proceeded to babble incoherently for what seemed like forever, jumping quickly from one topic to the next as Dave tried in vain to get a word in. He announced that he had just got married and stuck up his wedding finger crudely, saying that the ring meant he was ""one step away from a lawsuit"". He was obviously off his tits, and kept saying that he was an ""ex cocaine addict"", and that he used to ""shoot up, oh sorry, JUICE UP"" (wtf?!). The Clappers seemed scared. Paul seemed happy. 
Dave eventually cut in and went to a commerical, immediately turning around and walking away from Richard Lewis without a word. A man came over and tried to escort Mr Lewis off the stage, whilst he protested and flailed his arms around trying to get Daves attention. Several more Late Show employees walked him off the stage and stood at the side talking to him (an intervention!). 
The commerical break ended and Dave commented that both of his guests tonight had been in space. 
The show finished and everyone filed out of the theatre. 

Unfortunately paul and I decided to go out with marissa and everyone to clems (which appears to be the new south williamsburg hot spot?!) and missed the airing of the show so I have no idea how much of that they actually showed, but damn! So fucking funny. We came home and downloaded the episode from the 80's where Crispin Glover was on acid and almost kicked Dave in the face. Not as good as that, but still good. Thank you Richard Lewis, you crazy little coked up man you."

Space Shuttle Discovery Commander, Eileen Collins
Richard Lewis (The Aristocrats)

Kind of excited about Richard Lewis since I love Curb Your Enthusiasm. Wondering who the musical guest is, and thanking our lucky stars it isn't Black Eyed Peas (they're on on friday). I hate them with unbridled enthusiasm. 

Watched a <a href=""http://www.netflix.com"">Netflix</a> dvd of <a href=""http://www.lofg.com"">The League Of Gentlemen</a>  last night in an effort to keep up with british telly and have some non-American accents in my ears.  Unfortunately I found it mostly unfunny, and the Dole Officer-woman almost a complete copy of Margorie, the Fat Fighters leader from Little Britain. I don't understand why everyone I know in England seems to hate Little Britain, by the way. I think it's fricking hilarious. 

Right, off to paint my nails white whilst watching dawsons creek re-runs. 

I'm not joking either."

"event","Courtney Love apparently denies her own suggestions that she is pregnant by Steve Coogan. 

Yesterday it was reported that the Alan Partridge star denied claims that he had made the former Hole singer pregnant, branding the idea 'ridiculous'.

According to today's Sun, Love has also added her denial over the odd state of affairs, stating that she and Coogan are just friends who had met a few times in Los Angeles. 

The stories she is denying originated by her telling the News of the World: ""I am pregnant with Steve's baby, but I'd rather not talk about our relationship.""

Stolen from <a href=""http://www.digitalspy.co.uk"">Digital Spy</a>


The quote in 'News of the World' about Courtney apparently telling a friend how embarassing it was to be having ALAN PARTRIDGES BABY! seemed a little over the top. Americans barely know who the prime minister is, let alone alan partridge.

My godmother died yesterday, and i've cried a few times now though i know she died quietly and wasn't in any pain. I feel a little guilty for being glad that it wasn't anyone in my immediate family. I need to get my forms done so i can leave the country, and it's going to take 3-6 months. Might not even be able to make it back to dublin for xmas due to my laziness. Can't be any worse than last year though, my first xmas away from my family sitting in an flat alone with no telly, internet, or stereo, eating spaghetti and drinking cheap wine. 

 I hope to be able to look back on that and laugh pretty soon. 

Now i will watch 'The Motorcycle Diaries', being that i slept all fucking evening. Damn my sleeping patterns."

"event","Getting into (new) music again with a vengeance. Obsessing over the following:

*Youth Group- Skeleton Jar
These boys have come so so far. When i was residing in a little house in stanmore (Sydney) circa 2001 I was obsessed with the hauntingly beautiful B-Side (from 'Country Tour') Spry Griever and it's lyrics on the death of a friend- ""Your breath still hangs inside of the reciever/the leavee has it harder than the leaver'. Their new album is such a huge step forward for them, and they're already getting massively hyped up in the US with a song on the OC, appearances on Carson Daly, and amazing reviews from VICE etc. Noticed their single being promoted on the NME website this morning too, and apparently they played sold out shows in London a few months ago. Finally an Australian band making it big that actually deserves it. It's been a while, what with the horribly embarrassing Jet and The Vines.  They're playing CMJ here in nyc in a month and touring with death cab for cutie (blah), so i'm definitely planning on catching up with toby and danny for a drink and hopefully an interview. Strangely one of the only australian bands around from 1996-2001 that I haven't previously interviewed. I do remember drunkenly cracking onto danny at club 77, but that's another story. 
Favourite Songs off this Album so far: Skeleton Jar, Shadowland. 

*M83- Before the Dawn Heals Us
oh so good.  Floaty spacy electro-pop (for lovers).

*Sons and Daughters- Dance Me In

*The Favourite Sons- No One Ever Dies Young
Mentioned these guys before but they're so freaking good i'll do it again. Ken Griffin (ex Rollerskate Skinny, Aspara) has an amazingly wonderful voice that soars and sighs and now and then does this whole steve malkmus thing which sounds fantastic too.  Releasing their first ep this month ""No One Ever Dies Young' (i think that's the title) on GSL records. I've got a demo copy, and it's ace. They're getting a lot of hype around them already in nyc, and I predict they're going to be big. 

And everything else i've been listening to: 
*The Unguarded Moment- The Church* Seven One Eight- Fannypack* Eighties Fan- Camera Obscura* Queen Bitch- David Bowie* Blood On Our Hands- Death From Above 1979* Crimson and Clover- Tommy James and The Shondells* Your Woman- White Town* Woman-Wolfmother* pretty much all of Arular- M.I.A*

now download all of them and drink some beer and collapse in wonderment. or something. 


Currently trying to scam tickets to one or either of the coney island shows of this amazing festival:

"event","To add to my on-going online negativity (YAY) I present a small list of things that have been annoying the fuck out of me. My opinions, obviously, don't take them personally (you douches):

*Harry Potter being read by anyone over the age of 18. They're childrens books darling, and not even classics at that. Why don't I just start reading 'The Hungry Hungry Caterpillar' on the train then? I don't understand if people are just deliberately pointing out to me how immature and intellectually retarded they are, or if they actually think this is somehow cool. 

*Knitting. My nan has been doing it for years and it was never trendy. WHY NOW? If you're still knitting in five years i'll forgive you, but it seems like a fad.  Remember rollerblading? yeah. Like that.  And the wonky scarves don't look much good anyhow.


*Those annoying personal organisers, that new nintendo game; any small electronic gadget that involves a teeny weeny pen that you write things on the screen with or press the tiny buttons. Why do these things look so anal? I want to take that teeny weeny little fucking pen and stick it up your teeny weeny butthole.

ok that's it for now. I'm going to go stare at pictures of rainbows and unicorns and unicorns jumping over rainbows until i cheer up.

Funny thing is, boys keep telling me i sound sexier with my husky whisper, and i don't hear anybody complaining about the fact that bree can't talk.

I had two tiny pimples on my chin, and so being the vain git i am, smothered my chin in clearisil before i went to sleep. I've awoken to my chin peeling off, or as i like to put it; trying to escape. Fucking fantastic. 
Paul and i have also recieved an electricity bill about 5 times higher than usual due to having the airconditioners going non-stop for the past three months. I hate you heatwave. 
I decided not to take the hipster bar job, due to the fact it was in a woop woop part of brooklyn, and would have been more effort than it was worth. Also they wouldn't let me smoke for my entire shift (what's up with that? no reason given) and paul wasn't allowed to ever come to the bar. So i'm job hunting again but a lot more confidence due to having been hired twice so recently, and the fact that everyone is going back to school and leaving nyc now the summer is over. So many more jobs available, it's weird.

"event","Still reading 'The Ginger Man' by JP Donleavy (my reading rate isn't what it used to be) and I stumbled upon this passage last night which is nothing short of brilliant.

'But I think you're kind. And I'm just a little blase and not caring, but I worry very much what's going to happen to me, really. But after a while you get to hate everyone and everybody and you get very bitter inside because you haven't money and clothes and wealthy boyfriends asking you out to smart places and even though you know that really all of it is false, it somehow manages to seep in and you find yourself resenting the fact that all you have is a good brain and you're smarter than they are but would like to wear false breasts because your own are flat but you feel it's such a horrid lie and yet they do it and get away with it and then in the end you're faced with the blunt truth that they will get married and you won't and that they are going to hate their marriages but then they will have tea parties and cocktails and bridge while their husbands are sleeping with other men. 
She was a girl gone away. 
And I put my finger in her sad, tight, little hole, feeling lost and crying and wandering in rain and trees, a world too big, and lost and her dark head was so dark and her eyes shut.'

Not much one for punctuation, that JP Donleavy. Brilliant all the same.

Waiting for paul to get back from fixing up Longwaves latest film clip/music video. Woke up to some strange poster stuck on the wall saying 'I am sorry you are pissed off because i came home late! I love you bree!'.  He stumbled in from recording music with casey at 7 fucking AM and woke me up and apparently thought making some poster would fix it. He IS cute though."

"event","Just had two job interviews in the city. A cigar bar that exists in LES is opening another bar in williamsburg where i will be required to wear a black cocktail dress and white pearls to work. I got that one, but it sounds rather bizarre and a little scary, not to mention the fact i will fucking stink all of the time. Then i went to a mass interview for a bunch of hipster bars owned by the same peoples around the LES/East Village/one in Red Hook. I knew one of the girls at the interview from Trash, and afterwards we ran into her with our friend Ronnie and she got phoned while we were talking to be told she had the Red Hook position. I immediately felt shite, and annoyed that they had seemed very bothered by the fact i was married. Apparently I am expected to be ""crazy and fun"" and flirt with everyone and being married will make me less ""crazy and fun"". I'm not taking my top off, if that's what you mean. I can't wait for my forms to go through so i can apply for proper fucking jobs where they don't expect me to be a slut. 
I'm disheartened by the whole experience. Wondering if i really want to stay here. It's always so easy for me to pack up and leave, but this city really makes you want to try. Try and conquer SOMETHING. There's so much more i want to do here, and if i left i would regret it, as it would feel like quitting this time, it really would. So i'm stuck here, knowing i have to put in tons more effort, knowing i have to get better at manipulating things, and not really sure if i want to in the first place. Ugh, this endless quest to get somewhere, knowing full well that nothing will ever really be enough. And then you have children and die. 
haha. See, i'm totally crazy, but maybe not fun?! 
I should have told them that. 
""well i'm insane, sure, but it depends on your definition of fun.""

I think i will apply at more places. I just want a normal fucking job, is that too much to ask for? 

Definitely getting pissed tonight.

EDIT: I am such a fricking drama queen. But everyone knows that already. I just got the job with the hipster bars, and i will be filling in shifts at quite a few of them, so i'm going to take all the jobs i've been offered and... i feel better now.  So basically ignore all the above. Apart from the getting pissed part. There's always a reason to get pissed, and now it's because i'm working tomorrow, rather than because i'm depressed. whatever.

Another interview tomorrow at a cigar bar in town that's opening another bar in williamsburg. I wouldn't mind getting a job at either, though i do hate cigars. I need to be working somewhere cliented by rich old men who tip well (that isn't a strip bar hah). 
Loveless this thursday and i'm going to organise my first interview in years where i'm doing the questioning! Ken from Rollerskate Skinny is djing and his new band The Favourite Sons are the best thing i've heard in months. 
Was lucky enough to catch their first gig at Trash earlier this year with paul as paul has known him for a decade or so. They kind of have a Pavement quality to them. I managed to get a copy of their demo ep, and it's brilliant. 

I'm planning on getting a music based magazine/zine together before xmas, which is what the interview is for.  Paul's going to take photos and help with design and I'm going to do most of the writing. It's nice to have a project underway again, as I'm getting really sick of spending all my time doing the usual boozing/reading/hanging out with people/watching telly.

Woke today with a pulled muscle in my forearm (i have no idea how), a horrible hangover, and that terrible feeling of vague humilation you get after a mostly forgotten night out. Staying in tonight as punishment. 
Received a cheque in the mail today for $150, which is perfect timing since i currently have $1 in my purse. I don't know how i always manage to scrape through somehow. 
My eternal holidays may soon be over though, as i have an interview for a cute little bar on St Marks in Manhattan on monday. Trying not to get my hopes up too much, but it would be perfect. Pauls off on tour again next week and i'm sick of being indulgent. Need to get my papers filed for citizenship, and it's damn expensive. 

Was randomly thinking about this boy at my primary school yesterday, Jason, who was in love with Charmaine Sullivan-Brown, a vapid cheerleader type at the tender age of 10. After repeated refusal on her part to start 'going out with him' (not actually going anywhere, mind, just holding hands in the schoolyard type thing) he dramatically declared he would kill himself, and spent the next few days chewing pencils ethusiastically in the playground. He finally stopped eating the pencils when someone explained to him that they didn't actually contain lead. Jasons' suicide by lead poisoning was therefore thwarted.
 I wonder what mental institution he resides these days. 
It's funny how much you think about the past when you have far too much time on your hands.

Paul installed a new airconditioner in our room yesterday, and put our old one in the lounge room. This means we can shut the front windows and block half the the volume of the constant puerto rican party that goes on under our window 24/7. Life is definitely improving.

Had my photo taken twice for two different hipster photo websites. I really feel a part of williamsburg now. I do.

Cassandra came to stay for two days and we got trashed and talked shit all over the city. Go Loveless. I also got cranky at one part and sat in a puddle to cry for a minute before getting over it. I love me.  Ish.

Was appalled and terrified by the london bombings, leaving several scared and dramatic msgs on friends voicemail when they failed to call me back within 48 hours. Sorry karen. 

Reading the Ginger Man by JP Donleavy (brilliant descriptions of life in dublin), watched Closer (i hate you julia roberts), a fantastic Pixies documentry, Garden State (love zac braff, hate natalie portman and her retardedness), The Incredibles (err).

We stayed up all night and i had 3 hours sleep and went into work and discovered that they had created a new version  of my own personal hell there, just for me, which is what they always do when i go into work hungover.
Last time they had set up a jazz band with trumpets right next to the bar, and to top it off a really bad art show, where everyone drank water and nobody tipped. Today it was a house music party, full of girls wearing sequinned tank tops and boys with spiked hair eating free bbq chicken and meat and leaving bones and chewed up food everywhere. I was a vegetarian for 10 years and there is nothing more disgusting than picking up peoples leftover carcass for three hours. Especially when i'm apparently a cocktail waitress, and not a maid, nor a cleaner, and getting paid a massive $20 for my services. 
The bartender tipped me out though, and somehow i managed to walk off angry, but with quite a lot of money and a full bottle of expensive gin that some techno wanker left at the bar. 
I've stayed up all night again, while Leonie slept off her jetlag, and i know she's going to be up in a few hours and i'm going to be useless and i feel bad :( 
Rory is putting us on the door for motherfucker, which i've never been to and i'm pretty sure i won't like, so i guess it's another night of madness. 

Completely unrelated to all of the above, but i'm annoyed and angry about fake social climbing wankers and how many of them exist in this city, and how all of them are far too old to be so retarded and naive.

However Leonie flies in in an hour, and there's no way i'm going to be a grump and ruin her night, so i guess i better perk up quick.
Planning quiet drinks and then we'll steal jesse and drive into Manhattan to Lit to see Rory dj. 
A new pair of earrings is in order then.

also i would just like to say: MMMM JELLYBELLYS"

"event","Feeling stupidly sorry for myself today for no real reason. Yesterday my family sent us a big gift basket full of champage flutes and silly gourmet foods. I love silly gourmet foods. Today I recieved a dozen white roses and a vase, also off my family. They're sitting in the lounge room by the window, making the whole room smell wonderfully. I feel like it's the twelve days of marriage or something. I wonder what i get tomorrow? (apart from leonie! i wonder if she comes gift wrapped)
I'm supposed to be in soho right now, applying at these two bars paul has set up interviews with. Instead i'm sitting here feeling horribly unattractive and overtired and wanting nothing more than to curl up in bed and read for the rest of the day. I'll probably wait around until an hour before paul gets home from rehearsal before i'll leave. I'm lazy as hell and it's depressing. Called off djing tonight as we are horribly unprepared. This is also depressing. 
Signed for the roses with my old name, forgetting I do indeed have a new last name, and therefore have to come up with a new signature! How strange. 
Feeling unsocial and grumpy and hoping I cheer up tomorrow so I don't ruin Leonies arrival. 
Selfishly planning a little trip into Sephora after I apply at the bars. A new DuWop lipgloss will definitely brighten the day methinks. Sephora, how i love thee."

"event","My mother is going to kill me, but i got married in black. People who know me will understand how amusing this really is.
 I really didn't have much of a choice though, honestly. I had about two days in which to find a dress, and after realising that I am officially at least seven inches taller than any woman who wore dresses in the fifties, i exhausted the idea of wearing vintage off the rack, and hit up Bloomingdales. These are the moments i wish i shopped more, and not just at Beacons Closet, because i really have no idea where to go for nice clothing here. I hate clothes shopping though, i really do. If i can't find exactly what i'm looking for within about five minutes i sigh and pout and leave, usually with a pair of earrings or a new purse to make myself feel better about being a fussy bitch. 
Anyhow I eventually realised I had no time to go anywhere else but the store i was in and settled on a long black DKNY dress made out of some silky material (edit: actual silk. which explains the price tag), that is rather low cut but very me. I teamed that with one of those little black cardie things that are pretty much just the arms (but tied at the front so my boobs wouldn't pop out during the ceremonials), and wore stilletos and put my hair up... sounds bizarre but looked pretty. I felt completely beautiful the whole day actually, it was wonderful.  We took tons of polaroids and got others to take photos, so i may post some soon, who knows. 
Our room at the chelsea was fantastic. The 'Junior Suite', apparently. Jimi Hendrix used to live in that room (520 if you're interested). I felt like the Lady of the Rockunroll Manor. 
Everyone turned up and we got a noise complaint, but luckily no one called the cops. It's the Chelsea for chrissake. We got given a beautiful huge crystal decanter, two heart shaped pills, bottles of expensive whiskey, wine, and Patron, a bottle of Veurve Clicquot, and other stuffs. Basically it fucking rocked and we gave everyone two days notice. Pooey to all this planning weddings for a year stuff i say. 

Now we're home after another day rolling around in bed in our/jimi's suite doing crap all. Feels like we've been on a holiday and it's great.
Watched the Life Aquatic last night and loved it. Wes Anderson is a genius. 
Djing on Thursday night for our Lawrence Kansas City night and Leonie gets here from London on Friday. Trying to stay in for the rest of the week and just work and look for work and write and be productive. 
Can't believe i'm actually fucking married. It feels absolutely perfect."

Got my haircut today and now i have a nico haircut ie. a fringe/bangs. I hate saying the word bangs, but when in america...
So i am staying here, and not going back to australia, which is a relief as i had no idea what i was going to do with myself there. I couldn't imagine being without paul. AWWW.
So we will be married tomorrow afternoon, and a party at the chelsea at 6pm. Cake and champagne and polaroids and love.  I will try not to take smack and make paul stab me to death, but then i don't think we got sid and nancy's room anyway. 

We had vip for the mercury rev/the doves show on wednesday night and turned up after 2 hours sleep and running around the city all day. Mercury Rev were fantastic, and the doves were bland and dull, as predicted. 
Afterparty at the Beauty Bar and a certain nasty bi-polar gay elf singer decided to ignore paul, making him get upset and leave early. I wasn't surprised at all, as he is an arsehole, but disappointed by the rest of the bands behaviour, in appearing to have been swallowed up their own arses. Grrr. Told a certain someone my opinions who i knew would talk loudly about it later, and left with jesse to the darkroom and royal oak. 
So sick of nasty vomitous people with massive egos. So sick of bands and backstage and afterparties. I don't know how i did it so much five years ago, now i go backstage and want to get the fuck out as soon as possible. Free alcohol= good, hovering around in a room full of people who are looking around way too much= sucky. 

Anyhow, as of tomorrow i have a new last name and that is fucking bizarre. But fantastic. 
I guess i have to grow up soon, now i am wifey! 
yikers.

ps. thanks to everyone who sent lovely comments. :)
pps. will miss you cassandra, and come visit soon!"

After much consideration about how none of us could afford it, paul jesse and moi said fuck it and went into the beauty bar to meet up with darek and the intercooler lads. So good to see darek, so good to hear australian accents (the bogan boys at the australian bar don't count). Had one beer at beauty bar, and after acknowledging the Carlos D herpes trail at the bar we moved onto Lakeside Lounge and B-Sides. B-sides was disgustingly crammed full of the strangest mix of hipsters and jocks, with coke apparently being the one common interest. Darek and the boys had to leave to get up early for a record company meeting or some bollocks, so paul jesse and i returned to Lakeside Lounge for the photo booth pictures, and sex tests. Paul is 'Amorous', I'm 'Burning' (yeah it hurts when i pee), and Jesse is apparently off the scale because he got nothing. I wanted them both to get 'Needs Help', dammit. The photo booth pictures are the most hideous things ever, i'll try and post one later. 

Cocktail Waitressing the Twin Peaks night at my work tonight and then meeting up with darek tomorrow to run around the city and cheer him and the boys on at Arlenes Grocery. 

Going downstairs to check the mailbox without any make up on because i'm dying to get my netflix. See how fucking vain i am? I'm only checking the mailbox and i'm still considering mascara. I'm getting married in two weeks, i should be letting myself go.

Fights and fights and calling my mother crying- london or australia? or perhaps i'll marry another. 
Now we've made up somehow and things have to be sorted still but it's under control, except for all the apologies that need to be made. And how i have to try harder, he has to try harder. Always with the harder. 
Called in sick for work today, and i desperately needed that money. I looked a wreck though, and hadn't slept in about 24 hours so it seemed neccessary. Oh for a little normality. 

Discovered sally's blog and an entry about me saying how i apologised to her (only because i wanted to get over it, not because i was in the wrong in any way), and how she thought it best to keep a distance.  Pfft. I was only doing it for nostalgia and a place to stay in paris. Not wasting my time on that silly cow anymore.

"event","Djing went alright, though a lot needs to be discussed if paul and i are going to run the night together. We can both tend to be a little bossy sometimes. 
Went out with jesse and eric saturday night to Lit in Manhattan, which sucked accordingly, so we picked up paul and headed back to Bushwick (brooklyn) to Asterix where Fio and Caseys band were playing. Missed the show so drank my own weight in vodka. It was ok though, because i wore my newly customised and totally hot Rolling Stones tongue titty top (wow alliteration), so i managed to look sexy instead of just trashed. Fell asleep on the lounge with jesse and stumbled through my front door by four pm, to the amusement of paul.
Spent yesterday slobbing in bed with paul eating thai delivery and watching dvds. Sean of the Dead (finally!) which was fantastic, Midnight Cowboy (i love that film), and the second disc to DIG. I think paul was just trying to see if he was in this one too; he's egotistical like that. Speaking of which he might be featured in this ID magazine special soon as one of the 'Cool Kids of New York'. I hope he is so I can bag the shit out of him for the rest of his life.  mwahahah.

The cheap (though fabulously cute) earrings i have been wearing have made my ears infected :( fuckers.

I only found out we were doing it yesterday so it's pretty rushed, but hopefully some people will turn up anyhow. Next month we'll be prepared! Ciao!Manhattan playing on the walls and the oil projector up and running and some flyers done. The only problem is luring people over from manhattan; people are so fucking lazy. It's one stop on the damn subway line. You'd think i'd asked them to come to texas for a night. 
Made $230 or so bartending last night! At my shitty bar, on a wednesday! Unthinkable. And some cute cute boy spent the whole time cracking onto me and complimenting my music selections. Luckily i had my gay friend johnny to tell every boy that comes near me that i'm getting married. I think paul hired him or something. 

Now i'm off to find something cute to buy with my cizzash. My clothes are becoming tedious. I'll probably come back with five pair of earrings instead though, as they appear to be my new obsession.

the funny thing is about using a computer at another persons house is that when you start typing in your website, if they have searched it before it comes straight up. So that's funny, and flattering, and weird; because you don't exactly know who it was that typed it in. 
Things are ok right now. I have a job with people i like. I'm meeting girls i really like; which never happens. I'm really digging my friends, and the people we hang out with. I still want to get fucked up a lot, but i figure that's hand in hand somehow with the people we are, the people i know, and how we live. I don't feel especially good about it, but that's how things are right now, and fuck it i'm 24. 
I have another job pretty much by tuesday that's going to make me a lot more money, which is fantastic, because i want to pay rent and also buy myself new everything. I am a material girl, and new things make me happy. Sad, but true.
But i don't know what's going on here. The person whose computer i typed this into came up with several different versions of searching 'me', and i'm not unhappy about it. 
You never stop loving someone once you love them. That includes being 'in love' with them, or just 'loving them', or any combination of the above.

"event","What really sucks is that since the customs have read my journals twice, i have stopped keeping a real LIVE paper journal. So i often feel compelled to write the stupid emotional crap i would usually write on paper in this VIRTUAL journal. Obviously, if you consider the situations i have been through, it's probably just as private. However I still feel the compelling need (as one probably should) to refrain from writing anything embaressing in a public forum. 
I'll try to keep it not terribly embaressing then.
I hate my job again, and wonder when i will ever find a job that will make me feel happy and at ease. I sometimes feel that i never will, and am not really set out for the workforce as a whole, though i am quite a hard worker and never feel really crap at anything i do. I just lose interest so quickly in any job that i want to leave after two weeks, at the most, and it takes a lot to keep me around. I suppose that makes me a quitter really, though i never really quit so much as get less interested until they eventually 'let me go' in a friendly way. I should quit probably, but i guess i like to let them down slowly- ""i'm fucking bored, please fire me soon"". 
I'm actualy not terribly good at keeping up anything past about two months.  
I'm sick of travelling/moving/having no stability. I need to know i'm staying here for a long time and i need to know now. I try to live in the present, and often do, but as a whole i can't see any meaning to life as it is unless i can see myself moving ahead. I need to be able to see a future in things or i'm off. I've always been this way. I don't like to feel like i'm wasting my time, which is an amusing trait in someone who pretty much does nothing else but.
I feel like i've aged about 10 years in the past 6 months but i'm still the same girl talking too much shit out of her arse. Maybe i need to stay home for a while and just work and read?
Somebody said to me tonight (though not really somebody i would quote in general) that New York City is a city that you have to keep moving in. That if you stop here, you will fade away. That there is no point in being in NYC if you're not moving because you could just as well be somewhere else. 
I understood what he was saying, and at the same time i thought- how egotistical. This city is made out of people 'moving' that aren't going anywhere. What he was talking about, and what i think as 'moving' are very different things. I think you should be involved in things wherever you are because it is productive and good for your personal well being. Sure there are a lot more opportunities here than other places, but you shouldn't think yourself special just because you are here. And constantly keeping yourself busy, in my experience, is just another way of avoiding thinking about things, And avoiding thinking about things, however great it may seem, is fucked up for you in the long run.
You should 'do' things and be involved in where you're living, but you should never think that wherever you are living makes you better than other people that aren't living there. And you should always be aware of why you are doing things, even if it hurts to know the truth. Because if you don't, you're generally an arsehole. 

And there is my two cents, and you should never start a sentence with 'and', and i need to fucking sleep. duh."

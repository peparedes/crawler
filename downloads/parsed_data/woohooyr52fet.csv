"event","k well, where do i start! the good bit or the bad bit?


the bad bit first me thinks so we can end on a good note! well it all began on friday mornin at about 7.45am on me way to work my van decides its gona jus rev the nuts off itself!as it does now n again so i try to control it by using the clutch thn all sudden the Engine management light comes on n im like o.k go to giv it gas n nout happens! fuck broke again for the 20th time since jan 04. but with a lil will power it creeps to work sumhow n gets towed to garage. 1 van outa 3 down! the day thn made worse, because 1 of our fitters is in norwich! 2 fitters n 1 van left take all the jobs n do thm together day goes well. next mornin get picked up go work, spend 2 hours faffin around wid sum guys bmw only to work out tht if the glass was the right width it cud of been sorted the first time n i wudnt have to see him again. thn i go n do a lorry window which proves to be an ahole to do only to get back n discover tht justin reckons his van isnt workin properly either n im spose to be using one of these to pick em up n go to me dads house. but wid only one van 3 fitters n a lot of drivin and time runnin short it all gets dodgy. but to cut long story short it worked out o.k n vans are being mended n fitters gettin back to work part from justin who has gone sick cos his wife is ill!

but the good stuff is tht i spent the weekend wid em, i managed to get the use of me car between me bro n sis's demands n take em to visit tunbridge wells. i think we had a rockin time! hehehe sounds funny! untill tht was my dads friend walked in uninvited!rather shockd n embarresd! but it didnt turn out all bad. had a good day the next day n we went and saw the sites of wells n had a nice walk n talked bout alota personal stuff! all for now, oh n i love emma lots!"

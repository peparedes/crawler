"event","Was discussing things with another friend and came to a realization. I'm sad because I always had a bit of a crush on him, and since I don't see him much it's a nice little fantasy I get to have for myself. 

But now my fantasy is no longer about him. It's about the boy I used to know 6 years ago. The problem is he still has too much of that boy in him, and I'm not the 20 year old girl I used to be. I have responsibilities and I'm such a MOM now. It's not good enough to fantasize about a 30 year old man living with his parents and goofing off all day with idiot 18-21 year olds. It's just not sexy. 

And on top of that he's really let himself go. He's sickly thin, and his legs are all messed up from diabetes and poor judgment. I can pretend to be psychic for a moment and predict that he'll lose a foot or some toes sometime soon to diabetes, but I hope not. I wouldn't want that for anyone. 

I'll always have a soft spot for him, because he makes me laugh and he's always so happy to see me. And with him i can relax and just be silly for a while and not worry about responsibility. 

But then he has to go, and I've got dishes to wash and a son to tickle; and I hope that I tell my son about this one day. About how important it is to have goals, and more importantly, how, eventually, everyone has to grow up. Even Mommy."

"event","I hung out with an old friend last night and I became painfully aware of just how much I've grown up.

We chatted and laughed like old times, then we started discussing more serious topics and the conversation moved to how we spend our time these days and the people we hang out with.

Turns out my (almost)30 year old friend is still hanging out with 18-21 year olds. And my first thought was ""because they have no responsibilities and nothing but time to hang out.""  It kinda made me sad. First, because my friend was stuck in his early 20s mindset with no hope of maturation.  Secondly, because I miss that time in my own life. I miss sitting around all day and not doing much besides hanging out with friends.

I took a long look at my friend, and I was glad that I had moved on. Though the thought distressed me, I realized that he reminded me of my ex; in a ""I'm a lazy fuck that will never grow up"" kinda way. And I hate that that has happened to my good friend, but it's his life and he has to grow up in his own way.

I'll always hang out with him when he calls, but it will never be like it was when we were both in our early twenties. And that's ok, because he still makes me laugh until I can't breathe, and we all need that sometimes."

I've decided I actually want to start writing in this again. i'm assured some peace and quiet, now that i haven't used it in years.

I went on a bike ride through downtown LA this weekend. I really had a great time. I hope to go to another one, but I really need a bike. It's not even funny. My friend loaned me a bike for amazon women. i could barely reach down to the curb. But it's cool. :) I still had a blast and I hope to be getting a bike of my own in the near future. 

sweet....

I'm supposed to be writing a paper right now, about the opposite of my real position. but it makes me feel like a hypocrite. It's going to come out very very sarcastic... i can feel it now. I'll post it here when i'm done, maybe you guys will get a kick out of it.

Anyways. Should you be attending, the ceremony will be on <h4>The Bridge of the Enterprise NCC1701-D In Las Vegas Nevada, at the Las Vegas Hilton, inside Star Trek - The Experience. </h4>Setting appropriate attire is requested for all attendees, so start planning your costumes now.

Have you ever fallen asleep next to someone and it's the deepest sleep you've ever had, not only that, but you fall asleep with the happiest safest feeling you've ever had and wake up totally rested and smiling, eager for the day?

try it sometime, it's wonderful, though rather addicting. i never realized how bad insomnia was until i slept like that then had to sleep alone. just couldn't get comfortable, like i'd found the perfect nook in his shoulders to rest my head, then nothing else would relax me. shoot. no wonder i'm tired.

"event","i feel rather snippy lately, maybe just backlash from the whole bush thing. but you know what i hear the most about all this, ""i don't care""

i gotta say, those three words make me sadder than anything, because in a world where most countries have a 90% or higher voter turnout, we're struggling to get 60% to the polls. and maybe if that other 40% gave a damn we wouldn't be stuck with bush.

he's a moron, but so is kerry. he's a liar, sounds like both, and he's a fuckup. wow, just described alot of people.....  maybe it won't be so bad, but the last time the republicans we in power it was the 80s and that's when everyone was doing crack and coke and spending money they didn't have and the rich got richer selling drugs to the poor then cutting their healthcare and fucking the poor in the wallet again then they had to go to the dr for drug-related health problems. 

not to stand on my soap box again, but fuck!! when will these people learn? when will the so-called civilized and intelligent people of america stand up for themselves against the fucking 1%?

we let 1% of the population haave like 90% of out wealth, why? there's not that many of them,, we outnumber them 99-1, so why do they control us? why do i have to listen to a puppet tell me marijuana is gonna make me be stupid and shoot people accidently and run over children when what they really mean is i'll speand less on their cigarettes and i may even reject their polyester for hemp fabric and say hell no to their oil in favor of a cleaner more efficient fuel made from hemp oil. i'm surprised that they aren't spreading around rumours that electric cars cause brain damage and strokes due to electric shock buildup.

so fuck the politic and fuck the government, they lie to you anyway,

in the event i don't get a voucher to ozzfest, i have an awesomely awesome back up plan. me and the little muffin have a reservation in a resonably ok hotel sort of near beach, in which we'll have dinner and maybe go to knotts or disneyland or the la kids museum or something equally cool. ozzfest would be the shit though. totally want to go man. gonna buy me some steeltoes to wear, just in case. heheheh.

man i love helloween, can't believe david loaned them to me. gonna burn em. oh yea.

"event","Rise And Fall 
by Helloween 

Once a singer sang 'bout bullshit
Everyone could see him fall
And be sure it's been his last hit
He's never been seen at all

Some dictator felt progressive
And lay down in the sun
But his people were aggressive
They killed him with a gun

Sometimes you're wrong
By some things you have done
You see fate is too strong
Nothing's won
No use for a fight
If you're not acting right
You'll be cut down to size
Like a lie

It's the rise and fall
The prize for all
That ain't nice at all
Luck is like a ball
You can't recall or care at all
So better use your brain

A little dragon could spit fire
But never so for something bad
He didn't know the knight's desire
To throw a lance into his head

Romeo loved his Juliet
Their parents told them ""Stop""
Then it all turned out peculiar
He couldn't get it up

And it's all in vain
When you're living with pain
Reap not goods you have grown
By your own
Feelings you like
Disappear overnight
You sip up every grin
Free to win

It's the rise and fall
The prize for all
That ain't nice at all
Luck is like a ball
You can't recall or care at all
You nearly go insane

A spaceman flies the rocket
That takes him to the stars
Thinks his wife is in his pocket
But she's strolling 'round in bars

The king of Los Angeles
Bought himself a teddy bear
And the queen became shameless
She did it with a chair

Sometimes you're wrong
By some things you have done
You see fate is too strong
Nothing's won
No use for a fight
If you're not acting right
You'll be cut down to size
Like a lie

It's the rise and fall
The prize for all
That ain't nice at all
Luck is like a ball
You can't recall or care at all
So better use your brain"

"event","per a request, yesterday's exciting tale of compton.

got lost trying to find the courthouse, twice. sat in a huge green room waiting selection. listened to the lady next to me try to do a crossword puzzle in german. pirates of the carribian came on. people got called to panels, i continued to sit and read a comic. lady with the german book started telling me about the blue line, and asking me if i took it. talked about it for a while until some guy came over to enlighten us on where the blue line met the green line.

had an egg burrito from the cafeteria, now my stomach hurts.

oh, and some guy was trapped in the stairwell and had to pee really bad, but no one would let him in because the door said it had an alarm. i finally let him in, turns out that the door on the ground floor of the stairs has an alarm, so the only way out if there's no fire is the elevators which take forever.

oh, and i'm gonna try and sell my blood for ozzfest tickets."

"event","i slept on the couch last night, it gave me the weirdest dreams. 

dream one: i was in like a ghost house with jeff goldblum(he probably got in there cause i just watched 9 months) and there was something really wrong with the house. there were like ghosts everywhere and only this little girl could see and hear them and they were driving her insane. and the only way out of the house was this door, but it ook like a chest of drawers(i know where that came from, in the la times there was a story about this place that was the furniture capital of the US and they built a building that looks like a chest of drawers, with a sock hanging out and everything)
so then this chick starts flipping out and speaking in tongues and shit, so i ran away and hid, but the longer i stayed there, the more i noticed that it wasnt a very good spot. and something was coming around the corner.... then i woke up.


dream 2: i was in mexico, at some hotel and i parked my car out front, then we went to go get something to eat, took like 2 seconds, when we came back my car was gone, i asked the manager what happened to it, he sadi he needed the space, so he threw it over the wall. it was my old car too, stout. so i went looking for it. i met this really nice mexican guy, who took my hand and led me around to where he thought he saw the car, but it wasn't my car, so we headed back to the hotel, on the way we ran into christina chen! she made that face she always used to make, you know, that crazy one. and she said hi and invited me to go see her grandma or something, but we had to go right away. then some old ladies, big strong old ladies, came out of the house behind her and ushered us towards this other house with a shrine out front, and all i could think was, shit, this doesn't look good. and we were just going through the door.... and i woke up.

i hate when i don't get to see the ending. it's like seeing a movie that cuts off right before the climax.

ok that's the end of weird dreaming hour. hope you had fun. and i better not see any best selling novels or scripts with these as plots.... unless i'm getting 10%, then go for it.

love you all, and i really mean all of you."

"event","i seemed to be tired lately. a problem easily solved by an early bedtime, and more easily perpetuated by late night tv.

hanging out at my house. i feel like it's falling down around me. ever notice that life lounges around for a while, then decides to drop a big ol bomb right in your lap? last week i was having a good time at work, fun time with friends, my boy has a job, doing good in school. now i'm tired, my best friends have to move out of their house, its coming down to the wire on my ceramics project, which i'm not all enthused about it anyway, and people are.. well, being people, can't blame them for being who and what they are. i feel like it's some great upheaval, like an earthquake, and all the piece of my little puzzle are gonna get scattered to the wind and i'll never really find them again. and it was such a nice picture. 

watching nine months. i think it's making rachel feel better to know that everyone acts like that. that all guys are stupid when it comes to babies. i'm so happy she's here. they say pregnant women glow, i dunno if that's true, but she looks so great. with her backache and her little swollen feet, and her belly button that's an outtie now.

i had the best time on my birthday, had to run around a lot to visit everyone. saw my sweety, my friends, my grandma, and then my family. got some good stuff, doesn't really matter. it's not about the stuff, it's about the people. and i really love them. they make me feel good.

had a jarring experience today. all over some stupid little pixels on a piece of glass and plastic. people like me........
fuck it. it's not a big deal. just a small stabbing pain, somewhere between the 6th and 7th vertebrae...................



anyway i dunno, i feel like i need a hug. a reeeeally big hug.

maybe like two....."

"event","so much work... but i enjoy it. oddly.

they made me do attaching today. i hate attaching! basically it's taking 400 pages of edits, searching through 4 big filing cabinets for the files, only about 50 of which you're likely to find, attaching the edits and putting them on the table to go out. it's a fucking hassle. plus, before all that, i have to file the some 60 files that everyone took out and used during the day. ahhhhh!!! and all that in about an hour and a half. i'm getting faster though. plus my work buddies are nice and help.

i'm kicking butt in zelda. i dug my old gameboy out of the garage and have started bring it around with me again. they only problem is that i have never gotten this far in zelda so i don't know what i'm supposed to do now. oh well, i'm gonna beat it on my own for the first time w/o cheating. kickass!!

i got some awesome stuff off e-bay. mostly metal. i love metal! i've always liked it though, i mean twisted sister's my freaking favorite band, and nothing's ever gonna change that. and they are freaking metal god dammit it, agree or i'll kill you. :)

metal's fun though. i love headbanging. me and the guys are planning a trip to ozzfest. judas priest is playing! and cannibal corpse! have to admit though, i only know priest for ""breaking the law"" and corpse, well, i have heard a lot of them over the last few months, but i mostly just think of them as that band from ace ventura. i like all their music though, so i'm totally going.

i'm also gonna go see twisted sister. according to their website, they're touring this summer, with any luck we'll get some west coast dates!!!! i hope i hope i hope!!!

that's about all i feel like typing. it's late and i'm freaking tired. good night people, sleep loose."

i'm watching the sex and the city ending and it makes me miss my friends.

on the upside, michelley is having a 21st b-day party. underage drinking only if we stay over, but screw that, i'm gonna take a couple of joints and party my way. i hate alcohol. should be a good time though. they're my friends, and i won't tell them, but i won't do it till after they start drinking cause i don't wanna hear any guff about it.

i'm not sure how many people know, but on friday the 13th i got my nipples pierced. so many people kept telling me it was gross and wondering why, but it was for me, because i've got nice tits damn it! and i accesorized them. and i love how they look. and before you ask, yes it hurt. but it was worth it, all the worst pains are worth it.

i hate that i don't see my friends as much, but that's working i guess. i went to the thrift store the other day and saw a julie andrews tape. i got it, more for vanessa than for me. i don't want to be fighting with her, i never did. i miss my friend, but if she was saying things behind my back, was she ever really my friend? or was i just a convienience for her. i know if she was reading this she'd tell me to let it go, tell me that it's over and we're not friends. maybe i don't want it to be over. maybe i just want my friend back. i have the feeling this was all over a misunderstanding on her part. i am not dating chris babe. i don't know why you think i am. i cannot and will not ever date him again, but he's still my friend. i still love him, a lot actually, but sucks to be me then, because i'm not gonna do it. it hurts that this is all over a guy. at what point did we all become so petty? at what point did the standard shift against me? when was it impossible to just tell me the truth to my face? and when did every misfortune get blamed on me. my best friend is leaving for spain in a week, and i won't even get to see her off. i don't even get to say good bye. it's fucked up and it sucks and i'm angry. i'm angry at her and at chris and at all of them. mostly i'm angry at me. because i don't know what to do. i don't know what needs to be fixed. but you can't just fix people, they have to fix themselves. and i guess i'm the one who needs to be fixed,

 but i'm confused. i haven't had my best friend abandon me since i was in 4th grade, and it happened so often then, it just didn't hurt. i was confused, but not pained when they ran away from me, like i was a monster attacking the village, like i was an ugly freak. i worked so hard to change, i worked so hard to be what people wanted me to be. but you can't please everyone. if you do, you please no one. i can't even please myself. i can amuse myself, vanessa amused me, chris amuses me, margie amuses me. it makes everything very funny, but there's still that hole inside, where something needs to be, but i don't know what. i think it's my passion. it's not music, or movies, or books, or writing, or history, or chem, or friends, or sex. i don't know what to do. i don't know what i need. i doubt i'm alone, everyone needs something to fill them, to make them feel whole, it's the human condition. everyone in the whole world spends their life looking for the same thing as me...

so when do we find it? 






well, lemme know when you find out."

other people, on the other hand, of course, have balding cats, air-less tires, troubles at home, malfunctioning cars, disease, etc. it's terrible and all, they have my deepest sympathy and i do hope things get better for them, but since they keep looking down their noses at me, like they're shit doesn't stink, i've got news. karma's a motherfucking bitch! deal with it. 

and it's great because i get to laugh cause i don't have anything to do with it. it's like an awesome movie, where bad shit just starts happening to the bully, and you didn't do it, so you get to just laugh, guilt free. i haven't been near their place in 2 months, i haven't seen them or their cars since i got my new id card yesterday, and i don't have clippers or shron cat hair hidden in my car anywhere. call the cops, get a restraining order, take my prints and watch my fucking house dude, i've got nothing to hide, i haven't done <h1>ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!"

and look at the mess I'm in
A broken nose, and a broken heart
an empty bottle of gin
Well I sit and I pray, in my broken down Chevrolet
Well I'm singing to myself, There's got to be another way
Take away, take away
Take away this ball and chain
Well I'm lonely, and I'm tired
And I cant take anymore pain
Take away, take away
Have to return again
Take away, take away
Take away, Take away this ball and chain
Well I've searched, and I've searched
To find the perfect life
A brand new car, and a brand new suit
I even got me a little wife
But wherever I have gone, I was sure to find myself there
You can run all your life, but not go anywhere
Take away, take away
Take away this ball and chain
Well I'm sick, and I'm tired
And I cant take anymore pain
Take away, take away

Well i passed the bar on the way, to my dingy hotel room
I spent all my money, I've been drinking since a half past noon
well I'll wake there in the morning, or maybe in the county jail
times are hard getting harder, I'm going to lose and destined to fail

just have it stuck in my head. i've been making radio stations for my car, now that i know it'll work. mmm, mp3 cds..... 250 songs..... ::drool::
i'm losing weight again. maybe it's stress, or maybe just all the running around the office. whichever. i love my job still, and it's been almost 4 months. dunno, maybe it'll wear off, but i don't think so. i just love having something to do.




I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
You're living in the past it's a new generation
A girl can do what she wants to do and that's
What I'm gonna do
An' I don't give a damn ' bout my bad reputation

Oh no not me

An' I don't give a damn 'bout my reputation
Never said I wanted to improve my station
An' I'm only doin' good
When I'm havin' fun
An' I don't have to please no one
An' I don't give a damn
'Bout my bad reputation

Oh no, not me
Oh no, not me

I don't give a damn

I've never been afraid of any deviation

Oh no, not me
Oh no, not me

Pedal boys!

An' I don't give a damn
'Bout my reputation
The world's in trouble
There's no communication
An' everyone can say
What they want to say
It never gets better anyway
So why should I care
'Bout a bad reputation anyway
Oh no, not me
Oh no, not me

I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation
You're living in the past
It's a new generation
An' I only feel good
When I got no pain

stupid plans. oh well, we should go to the lacma next weekend after we get done working for jennifer... yea.

been hanging out with mike lately. he's cool. reminds me of guy friends i used to have when i was younger. i miss hanging out in a big group of guys without having status as someone's sister or girlfriend. it's nice being one of the guys.

and me fresh out of rope.
Please, ignore the lisp, I never meant to sound like this.
So take me and break me,
And make me strong like you.
I'll be forever grateful to this and you.

(Chorus)

It's only you, beautiful,
Or I don't want anyone.
If I can choose, it's only you.

Fix me to a chain around your neck
and wear me like a nickel.
Even new wine served in old skins
cheapens the taste.
I shot the pilot,
I'm begging you to fly this for me.
I'm here for you to use;
broken and bruised.
Do you understand?

(Chorus)

It's only you, beautiful,
Or I don't want anyone.
If I can choose, it's only you.

But how could I miscalculate?
Perfect eyes will have perfect hate.
If I could choose, it's only you.

""We're wrecking""
And I'm dry like a drum,
with springs to find.
I'll leave.
We're spending,
take our time in trials,
measured in miles.
We slave for days and weeks.

If I can choose, it's only you."

watchin gramma's pad. it's so nice here, quiet and such. and i can have plague without infecting people(which by the way is way i sat so far from you guys on tuesday). I LOVE PUPPIES!!!!!! I just want to pick up rusty and go spinning around the house, but i think that might make him sick. comet's such a sweet old puppy. i miss my kittens though, i wonder how they're doing.

::moths fly from pockets:: out of cash. again. why does it always seem to spend so fast? took gramma out to lunch. i enjoyed that. i love my grams.

i feel lighter,(maybe because i no longer have a huge wad of plagma in de tubes). i feel like everyone is arguing and no one remembers why. please don't argue anymore. i appreciate your defense of me, but it's gone too far. i don't enjoy anyone treating my friends this way, even if they don't want to be my friend, i can't just forget the last 6 years. maybe she's right, maybe we did out grow each other, but that's never been the reason for this fight. 

it started because i was angry that saylor was talking to a new girl without ever calling me to see what was going on. i got banned from his house and we just stopped talking for a month and it rememnded me of what happened with chris and i got angry. then ness decided to cheer saylor up and i appreciate the thought, he needs more friends, i don't want him to be stuck in that place alone. i did not appreciate being verbally torn to shreds and i got angry again, mostly because saylor said that my embarrassment was ""UPLIFTING."" beyond that, i don't know what happened, i guess people just chose their sides and started shouting at each other. this has gone on long enough though, every new post is just another reminder that i don't measure up to vanessa's or saylor's standards anymore. there is nothing new to say, it's all been said a thousand times. 

beyond that, life is going well, i love my job. i love the idea that i'm helping people. i can't wait for another event so i can frolick and laugh at bret stimley. everytime i see him i just want to watch ""Cannibal Women in the Avacado Jungle of Doom"" or something like that, i never can remember the whole title. does anyone have it?
i will give you something shiny if you loan it to me....

i guess that's all i can think of, don't feel any sleepier. does anyone know a good way to grab some zzz's? i guess it's too late to help me today, but maybe tomarrow i can join the ranks of the unconcious.

sweet dreams to everyone, no matter what."

i love my friends, each and every one is a unique and beautiful person, even the ones i don't get along with at the moment. i wish i was stronger, strong enough to make all of them feel loved and appriciated, but i can't and apparently my efforts are worthless. <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/thewolfjp/19158.html"">and the people i love most in the world can't even say it to my face.</a> 

surprise... i'm not perfect, but i am still a human being. it still hurts when my very best friend in the entire world and my oldest and dearest friend tell me i'm a horrible person. i value their opinions more than anyone's and i don't measure up. i'm not good enough, not smart enough, not moral enough. i could call names too, i could defend my druggy ex, my pill popping friend, and my 13 year old drunk little chick. i could stand up for them like they deserve, because apparently no one else wants to stand up, and because they stand up for me, warts and all. they don't lie to my face and tell me they love me, then tell the world they were faking it. well, guess what, i was faking it too, every time.

I should do what my vengence cries for. i should say everything that deserves to be said, but i won't ruin your lives, not for something so petty. i won't strip away you dignity, even while mine is shredded around me. i may not have the moral high ground anymore. i may no longer be the straight edge while my best friend fried her brains out on drugs, but i'm still me. i'm still the one who was there for you, the one who drove you when you needed a ride, leant a shoulder when you were crying, did everything to help when you started freaking out. 

maybe i am a horrible friend who put my friends in bod situations, but look at yourselves for once. i can't see past my nose? you need to look closer to home. i was destroyed when i fought with cheryl and was banned from the house. i did it to defend you and you never defended me. i couldn't stop crying for weeks, because i couldn't see you. and you, i did everything you ever asked of me. and you lied to my face and talked shit behind my back, and made me lie for you. i drove you because you just had to get shrooms and i had a car. you have no right to judge me. either of you. i may not be the pillar of morality i used to be, but i'm not trash. i am not garbage you can scrape off your shoe. i'm a person and i may get angry and say thing i don't mean, but you're my friend, you're supposed to stand up for me, like i stand up for you. every time. and chris? you won't even say this shit to his face and let him defend himself. don't blame him for all your problems, because he didn't put his fist through the walls, he didn't throw wild parties and destroy the carpet and piss of the neighbors, and he didn't ban me from saylor's house. maybe i do spend too much time with him, but that's not his fault. and maybe you should spend some time reflecting on your own relationships: <h2>Shayna(who burned you and abused you)</h2> not forgetting the endless string of one or two night stands: dennis, mike, jenny's brother, the guy at jenny's grad party, thomas, not to meantion all the girls. how many of them have i lied about for you? who's putting who into stressful situations? when did i ever make you choose between telling a friend the truth about her girlfriend's infidelities and protecting your best friend? how uncomfortable was that? i stood up for you, for both of you, defended you when you needed me, and i'm the horrible person. that was a statement of fact. i never tried to change either of you. i may have suggested things, but the choice was always yours. when you agreed to let my druggie ex over it was your choice. when you took shotgun hits from me and my friend, that was your choice. 

so this is the end, and it hurts... but that's the way it is."

wondering about aimlessly. 

looking at the swirls of purple wind

teasing kisses from the trees

and twirling with the wild, fading, summer grass.




don't get as much sleep as i used to, but it's all good. get paid tomarrow, spent my last $20 today. life is good.
found out about something called the bizarre bizarre. must go..... imperative.

enjoying life. sounds good."

It was, back when the country was strong.
Back before Elvis; before the Vietnam war came along.
Before The Beatles and ""Yesterday"",
When a man could still work, and still would.
Is the best of the free life behind us now?
Are the good times really over for good? 
Are we rolling down hill like a snowball headed for hell?
With no kind of chance for the Flag or the Liberty bell.
Wish a Ford and a Chevy,
Could still last ten years, like they should.
Is the best of the free life behind us now?
Are the good times really over for good? 

I wish coke was still cola,
And a joint was a bad place to be.
And it was back before Nixon lied to us all on TV.
Before microwave ovens, 
When a girl still cooked and chopped wood.

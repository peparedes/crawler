so now summer is upon us. so far its been bad ass. running, lifting weights. i have to get ready to play college ball. against guys who are better quicker faster than me. just have to work twice as hard if i want to make it. yeh for those of you'll who dont know. i'm going to college in fort worth to a skool called texas wesleyan. well i think i'm going because the college is real expensive so i'm looking at other alternatives for money. trying to get sponsershiops from businesses and stuff like that. so if u'll can help me in ne way just tell me. thanx. but ne ways yeh i'm going to yeh play basketball for them if i get a chance to go. but yeh,hopefully everything goes good for me. 

let me tell u'll about my day since it was pretty kool. 1st it started off waking up at 12, yessss i love waking up at 12, c'mon let me it was sunday. well ne ways woke up and ate a steak, a delicious steak might i add. but yes. then went over to my cousins house with my friend peter, and his friend marco. we played x-box, some tennis game, it was pretty bad ass. then we went on the four-wheelers and were playing this game. let me explain. we each have 4 tennis balls. and we have to hit the opponent. the guy thats driving is 1 point and the passenger is 2 points. and we played up to 5 points. man we killed, it was fun though. after that i had been wanting to play real tennis, so we got a group of friends and played tennis at the park. it was fun real bad ass.

i hope to have more summer days like this. but this is already long enough. i dont know who's gonna read or what not but if u do leave a comment. thanx. & bye."

"event","considering i dont have a computer so i dont get to update in this as much as usual. so let me tell you wut has been going on in my life. the more recent one i'll tell you about...kinda sad? well my whole life, i have no idea what is wrong with me but i always like a girl that has a boyfriend. 1st it was amber, which we had a thing which was pretty big, and she never could get over rey, so that sucked. and that guy treated her like shit. and for real like real bad. but whatever. and now she got over rey and is with another guy. how ironic? but shit usually happens that way with me? i guess its kind of funny. 
then jena. well she had stopped talking to diego, and i thought she didnt like him ne more. so we talked, well maybe she considers it not talking so i'll jus say more than friends. we went to the movies, held hands, she even told me she liked me. bad ass, everything good. then one day at cross country practice she said that she had to let me go, becuz she was gonna get back wit diego. wow soo much for everything going good. and i cant say shit but from what i've heard he treats her like shit too. 
ok and now the more recent one. which some of u'll know. i wont mention her name becuz maybe she dont want me talking about her. so i'll just tell u'll what happened. she broke up with her boyfriend. i was talking to her. had bad ass conversations on the phone. and i mean bad ass. we didnt talk long but those short conversations were bad ass. then one night i call her to tell her goodnight, and as soon as she answers the phone she says i'll call you back. i asked her what you doing. and she said watching a movie with her ex-boyfriend. i was pretty tired so i thought i didnt hear right  so i just said goodnight and went to sleep becuz i had cross country in the morning. so go to cross country, then tennis, sleep, then open gym. o yeh o yeh. this is happening today, and we had already planned to go out on a date. ok now i call her after open gym. and i say, last night did u say you were watching a movie with ur ex. she was all yeh, he came over. then i asked so... are you back with him? she said yeh. right then and there my heart dropped, then somone was walking by and stepped on it. lol not funny but i'm trying to make the best out of things. then she says still friends...? and i say yeh not wanting to talk... can't even speak. speechless.
so basically waht i'm trying to say about everything is...i got bad luck with the ladies. maybe since its my senior year i should jus chill and concentrate on sports and school. thats what my parents say. but i'll tell u'll this much. i did like her, the recent girl. i though i was actually gonna have something serious, but i was mistaken again.
alright the other aspects of my life i'm running cross country. i hate it becuz i have to run and i get tired. obviously. lol but damn we work out a lot. and i'm also playing tennis. i've been playing for i think a month now, and its bad ass. its been alot of fun, and i mean a lot of fun. i wish i could jus play that but my coach for basketball is the same for cross country. so i kinda have to. i've jus recently joined golf so hopefully that will be fun too. lol. i'm doing a lot of sports right? lol but its bad ass. yeh well hopefully someone read this journal entry because i wrote a lot and that would suck if no one read it. lol alright then bye and i hope every is having good lives and keeps having good lives. bye"

"event","last night was weird. peter was talking to laura and i was just there listing, hearing them and wishing i had someone like that. u know one of those moments you see a guy and a girl talking just about ne thing having a good conversation and you think to urself damn i want something like that. well yeh that's what i had.

so out of now where there is a call on the other line. says out of area. so peter flashes over and it's someone i'd rather not say becuz she's paranoid about her boyfriend gettin mad at her. so we talk for a pretty long time just catching up and stuff. but i dunno it was nice talking to her. but with me and her its wierd because we both like eacother but something always happens to make us stop talking or something like that. but we talked like 3 hours. it was pretty good.

today woke up at 12. didnt go to practice at 8 for the 3rd straight time. i dunnno its just excuse after excuse. hopefully i'll get my ass up and go tomorrow. 

be ne ways. went to open gym at east and i played pretty good. then i went home. then in an hour matt comes to pick me up for our game at 6:30 and we're off.

the game went good. i did alright. but the freakin' 2nd team sucked. get this... we were up by 12 and me and javi (fellow player) get out of the game and they get outscored 15-2 in 5 minutes, 5 freakin minutes. oh my lord it pissed me off. so we're down by 1 with 10 minutes to go. and finally we end up winning the game by 1 point. ain't that craaazy!!! yup

so ne ways tomorrow hopefully i get to go out. i have kind of a date. but i dont know if you can call it a date. i dunno its weird. but hopefully tomorrow goes good wutever might happen. hopefully nothing bad happens and it turns into a shitty day.

yeh but i wrote a freakin' lot. that's a first but yeh prolly boring you'll already so i guess i'll cut if off here.

"event","hey. damn today skool sucked as usual. and then open gym was alright we lasted a long time and i did alright. then i talk to jean and that's always bad ass. i was trying to tell her to call me but i dont know where she is at! i'm sending her texts but no response. then we had a game at 9:30 against the seniors that graduated last year. we were doing awesome, but mike had to fuck it up by not trying and puttin in his cousin. i admit jesse did good and he tried, but joey just didnt play good at all. and then he was callin me a ball hogg. i was jus tryin to win. and then peter gave up, and i hate when he gives up. he could do a lot better in life if he didnt have that state of mind. so we ended up losing again. my mom got mad becuz she saw that the other guys wern't trying. roman u did good and peter too when he tried. fuck it. but i wanted to win. now i'm watchin the kings game. i love the kings. lol and thinking about jean. i know how she feels when she tells me she wants to be with me cuz i feel the same way. i jus wish she didnt go to another skool. but the weekend is coming up so......? goodbye everyone!!! holla"

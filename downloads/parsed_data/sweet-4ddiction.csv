"event","So, I heard that at one of Sarah's parties someone walked in on Courtney *the ugliest biggest boobed grossest thing* and curtis taking a shower.  I haven't said really anything about it, but everyone I guess heard about it because meghan this morning was like, good thing you got rid of Curtis hes so gross cara, you deserve better. and ""LYKE OMG NOOOO WAY"" it was Ashleys lyke omg sweet sixteen on friday and her parents were home and lyke Sam had lyke a condom in her purse and decided to tell all the girls she wanted to do it with curtis.  Well hunny, he sucks, at doing it.  He sucks in general, and I hope you find that out.  He goes from me, to these girls.  Its an insult to me, if you knew what they look like you'd agree too.  

Carebear270 (9:56:39 PM): hey
Curtdakilla (9:57:03 PM): hey
Carebear270 (9:57:13 PM): su
Carebear270 (9:57:14 PM): sup
Curtdakilla (9:57:34 PM): nothin
Carebear270 (9:57:48 PM): i like hearing about you and other girls
Carebear270 (9:58:16 PM): i'm not trying to be a bitch @ all, just to let you know
Carebear270 (9:58:23 PM): i just want to know if you did take a shower with courtney
Carebear270 (9:58:26 PM): and i know some shit about sam
Carebear270 (9:58:28 PM): that you don't know
Carebear270 (9:58:36 PM): just because girls talk i guess, adn they always decide to tell me?
Curtdakilla (9:58:52 PM): yeah i did it all
Carebear270 (9:59:03 PM): hm, done sam yet?
Carebear270 (10:03:57 PM): you've changed so much
Carebear270 (10:04:09 PM): and you told people i was 2 faced
Curtdakilla (10:04:20 PM): u are
Carebear270 (10:04:24 PM): i am not
Carebear270 (10:04:31 PM): just because you didn't fucking pay attention to me half the time.
Carebear270 (10:04:53 PM): how the hell am i supposed to hang out with you, when you don't really pay attention to me.  Exactly. you never saw the real me
Carebear270 (10:04:59 PM): you saw me, but you saw me with my friends
Carebear270 (10:05:02 PM): so you think i'm 2 faced.
Carebear270 (10:05:04 PM): i'm not fake
Carebear270 (10:05:12 PM): go look yourself in the fucking mirror and decide who you are curtis
Carebear270 (10:05:18 PM): because i see something totally different now
Carebear270 (10:05:26 PM): get a grip on your life
Carebear270 (10:05:34 PM): and pay attention to your next girlfriend
Carebear270 (10:05:41 PM): because i was nothing but good to your ass and i got nothing in return

I'm really bored, I think sundays are the worst day of the week.  I attempted to clean my room, and I ended up going through all my cds and listening to them since I have no clue what half of them are and no clue how I got them.  I have 2 baskets full of laundry to do :( and I really don't want to do them, my room is a fucking mess, atleast my closet is clean.  I need to go to the mall again,  I need to return that abercrombie shirt and I need a new pair of jeans since it doesn't seem its going to get WARM ANYFUCKINGTIME SOON :( I can't wait till next month, everything will fall back into place.  Only 4 months left till the best month of the year.. July. :) My birthday, the best parties, everything is better when it's July.  

I have that interview on Tuesday, which means I'll get the job--which means CARA the laziest person on earth will be working.  How am I supposed to make a decision about my work schedule now?  Part-time, full-time?  I can work full-tiime, and still go out at night... and if I work Part-time... eh.. I dunno, who knows what my summer will be like and what friends I'll be hanging out with by then.  Hopefully Arianna and I can become tight again like we were last summer, and maybe Lauren and I will get along.. and maybe stuart and I will talk again..."

"event","So, I'm in a good mood.  Today was alright, I don't feel like writing about it, but at my regatta we got 6/7 out of 11 boats in our race.  The wind was fucking horrible and it was wavy and I got really wet ;).  My mom and I went to Friendly's after my Regatta, our normal ritual and then I came home and slept..woke up and talked to jay for a pretty long time, I wanted to chill with him, but I don't really even want to go out.. and he has other stuff so its all good, we're going to chill next weekend. So, my belt and bra I ordered from Abercrombie just came :) I'm so happy!  I'm in love with it, I couldn't find an orange belt anywhere and of course it was at Abercrombie, who would of figured.  Ew, I asked Jay for this new AIM he has and he said he would give it to me and he just sent me a link for a porn site, GRR! But he just gave me the real link.  This is confusing, there are 2 Jays.  The one that lives in Cali, and the one that lives here.  I want the Md and Syracuse game to get over, and I want SYRACUSE TO WIN!  Maryland always come back at the end of the games though, which sucks.. Urgettinpunked: i really wana stalk to u more again.   Haha, I miss this kid. ""Redonkulous"" I think I just got a new word from Jay # 2.  I need to figure out a good way to talk about them... hm.  Anyways... about that game, my mom and I are going to go order outback and go to blockbuster.  I love my mom, her and I had a really good chat tonight about my relationships.  She knows everything about me pretty much... I was talking to her about the stuart-gretchen thing.  About how jessie called me and she was @ gretchen's and gretchen had been out with stuart last night, and I could really care less.  I'm not IN LOVE with stuart, he may be in love with me but I'm not in love with him.  I have love for him, yes because I've known him my entire life, but I hate how... hes been so desperate for me.  He told me he's hurt more from me then his family problems.  His family is fucked up. Rich. Got kicked out of his house. Family hates eachother. Mom out of rehab, still an alcoholic. Parents getting a divorce. His mom got a restraning order against him.  Its like, the little perfect family that used to live up the street from me, turned bad.  Everyone's family is fucked up in some kind of way, but I really took that as an insult when he said that to me.  Lauren used to be like ""Cara, you have everything you've ever wanted infront of you, take it. be with stuart""  Why can't anyone listen to me for once? Its my fucking life, my fucking relationship, my fucking decision.  I'm fine being his best friend, but he didn't like that, he was ""TOO IN LOVE WITH ME""  God.  I hate relationships, I hate hurting people I care about, even if its not my fault.  They make everything my fault.  Lauren and Stuart don't see what they do to me.  Lauren blamed her and eddie not talking on ME.  She told me it was all my fault?  I told Eddie and he was like NO, wtf, its because shes a bitch.  Just because I bitched at him because he was playing her and Jessie at the same time has nothing to do with him and her not talking.  She needs help, they both do.  I hate when people turn to alcohol to solve their problems.... I really hate it.  But I guess not everyone can see things like I do.



Damnit, Jay called me, I'm pretty sure, because he said he would, and theres a number on my cell phone I don't know.... Andy thinks I'm pressed.  Whats the definition of 'PRESSED'?  His birthday is wednesday.. hmm. :)"

"event","It's friday, and I'm not out.  I've become so used to this, I hate it.  I wonder what I'll do once I get un-grounded.  Colin said he's going to throw a Welcome-Back party for me.  :) I love being loved.  My day was alright, I felt like I was either going to pass out or throw up 1st-5th period.  Jay and I both talked about how we like eachother last night, today wasn't as awkward as I thought it would be, Brandy and Chanelle at lunch were like.. DAMN YOU HAVE A HOTTT BOYFRIEND, KEEP HIM.  Because they were talking to Jay and Andy, and i was just like...? boyfriend? boy...friend?  What? I just don't like that word, or that idea.  I'm not a good girlfriend because the job scares me too much, being 'together' or whatever is fine.  I'm scared of commitment because I'm so used to being single I guess.  Godddamn I'm hungry, I just came home from practice.  Today was supposed to be a light day? ha.. we raced the boys a lot and we didn't run, but we started for some reason.. spray painting one of our boats and stuff.  My coach Matt was seriously getting high off of it, coach Brian was like.. uhm.. whats with you?  Get away from that paint!  They're pretty young and cool and Brian is the quiet funky one, I don't think he brushes his hair, he looks like Waldo, the glasses and everything.  Then Matt, we call kermit because he has a huge gull chin or whatever it is, hes pretty funny.. but wierd.  We just joke around with him and he has an extremely evil laugh.  Erin was talking about something illegal i forget and he goes.. yeah like Karen got pulled over and the officer goes.. license and registration m'am? and He made these motions like taking his shirt off and he goes.. Heres my license, and Heres my registration.  I didn't get it untill he was like.. CARA! KAREN! FROM WILL AND GRACE! Crew people are wierd....  Oh god. I love you amber, and I'm so so so sorry you have to go through this at a time like this. <3 Losing people is so hard, death isn't something i'm not comfortable with.  Even if I didn't know them-- I always end up thinking about them.  Luis, that died june 31st last year, he was tight with everyone in our school.. and if he was still alive I know him and I would be friends now.  Thinking about that stuff, hurts....just thinking.. what if? What if... I hate death, and everything about it, who doesn't?  I guess its just one  more thing we have to overcome. <3 I'm always here for you. People really piss me off, I didn't really talk to anyone from 2:07-3:30 because Paul, Kristen, and some of kate really pissed me off. REALLY PISSED ME OFF.  Like anyone wants to hear inconsiderate comments about the decisions they make, or who they're with.. Kate was kidding, kristen I don't even remember what she said because Paul's words were burning through my ears.  I wanted to smack him so hard.  Fucking jackass, I swear.. gjkdslfjldsf.  I didn't know why I hate him so much last year untill today.  I didn't talk to him at practice, and everyone of course noticed that something was wrong.  The moment I got out of the car at practice everyone was like.. Whats wrong Cara? Whats wrong?  Because on the way to practice meghan was driving next to me, and she was smiling and shit and everyone in her car always does stupid shit cuz we're dumb? But I didn't look at them the entire time.  I'm blabbering on... people just notice when something is really wrong, I don't talk.  That's never normal.  I smell, I really need a shower and something to eat.  My mom and I are talking online, shes at work and says she wants a beer but doesn't feel like socializing.  She should come home and drink with her daughter...

"event","WELL!  After one month of no marijuana, :). I had just gotten home from practice and was hungry because no one ever comes home at my house :( so Shew brought me up dinner and his pen.  His special pipe pen. Weed is the best next to alcohol.  I'm in a good mood, after the middle of 6th period I went into such a freakin' good mood.  I left latin during C lunch and walked around and skipped down the hallway with kristen, I like the faggots that give me dirty looks.  Obviously they don't know WHO I AM. cocky.  So then I walked around and sat with jay for a while and talked to him...and he walked me back to class.  Awwwweeee.  This song was downloaded on an accident, and now I really like it.  Crew practice was SOOO HARDDDDD.  We rowed 5 miles.  5 MILES! I was so freaking mad, we have to row an eight in our race and we're going to suck.  There are 11 other boats in our race, that means they're going to have to do 2 heats of us, :( we're going to lose, really badly.  I hate how our fucking coach just randomly puts us into boats.  Hello we have 3 championship boats, and you SPLUT THEM APART, fucking jackass.  Then I think it started raining, but I wasn't noticing that much due to the excruciating knee throbbing pain I had.  Melissa and Adriana asked me what I was on today, because they were at the end of the skipping-path.  I always leave my classes and visit those 2.  I love them, they are so.. perfect for me.  They're the 2 out of 3 best friends that have always stuck by myside no matter what dumb shit I decide to do.  The 3rd one, still needs to figure out that this fight is her fault.  She caused it, she started it, she supported it, and now shes learning that some people just pay more attention to me, and if she doesn't walk up and talk to someone, they won't come to her.  God I sound so cocky, saying this makes me sound like a douche bag, and I've never realized that before... is my ego too big?  Theres always something wrong with me... I hate that.  I'm so against feelings like this, but don't you hate when all you do is think about someone?  Its like the exciting feeling of having something new, and unexplored.  I'm always up for a good adventure :) Hopefully something good will come of this one, I know his intentions are good...no hidden agenda there <3

I slept in this morning, after waking up to two nosebleeds I didn't feel the need to go to school at 7:20.  Now I'm bored, because I have no clue what my mom is doing or when she's going to be ready so we can leave...I want my license.  I hate gray days, I hate latin & Chemistry, I hate how ugly it is outside!  So full of hate cara..  I'm not excited about crew practice, we find out today if we're going to be rowing and eight or a four in the race on saturday, it sucks its an expierienced race no novices can participate, which sucks because I kinda wish kate could be in our boat if Ashley can't.  lol, Ashley's brother broke her nose, which made her get a black eye.. its pretty funny.  I just hope she doesn't have to get it operated on, so we can have her, jessica, kristen, and I in a boat like old times nad maybe actually win instead of some fucking retarded line up our new coach has.  I hate when people say crew isn't a sport, they don't know how hard it is, and how much pain I'm in because of it.  Our races are a mile and last 6-7 minutes, of non-stop excruciating pain! Anyways....... I'm going to go eat something.  I hope I get my hug from J today, since yeah, yesterday :). Its' so obvious, I need to shut up.

School was alright, I finally wore one of my new shirts, turns out the dumb thing had a tiny tiny hole in it, just big enough to have an effect on my mood, but its okay its one of those new swoop necks with the tank tops underneath. 5th period made me so angry. Photography- Luis and Ben kept whipping me with towels, so we got into a towel-whipping-fight. I ended up in the corner in the darkroom with a massive bruise, thats what I get for nailing luis in the face.  Then my dumb film that was already 2 weeks late didn't develop properly. But hey, after school I didn't have to go to crew practice :) I'm such a badass, I skip practice. 

Then I get home and do what I always do, talk to the infamous crackhead Jay, ;).  I got a call back from NVpools, which made me ecstatic.  I have an interview on March 23rd, which means I will get the lifeguarding job, hopefully placed at the same pool as Laura so we can be together all summer. 

I'm getting used to this bullshit.  Not talking to one of my best friends is hard, but somehow I have this wonderful ability. Ignoring her. Sitting next to her all history class and in latin isn't as bad as I thought it would be.  We haven't said anything nice to each other in a straight week..... wonder how long this fights going to last.  All I know is I HATE BEING GROUNDED.  I will never ever ever have a party ever again, I won't break anymore doors, and I definitely won't ever get 3 F's on my interim again, because due to those reasons March is as bad as February. Hopefully April will be better :).

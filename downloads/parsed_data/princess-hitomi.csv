"event","Today was another school day. Typical environment.


Period 0 - Singing - bleh, i still cant sing Every Heart ""sexily enough"" (thanks for my club leader pointing that out >.<)

school officially starts

Period 1 - Adv. Biology - fun fun, more notes, and a demonstration of cell functions

Period 2 - English 9A - vocab :/

Break Period - got some cup noodles to satisfy my hunger, since i didnt get to eat breakfast

Period 3 - Adv. Precalculus - meh, i got back test. Aced it. People glaring at me. >.<

Period 4 - Health/Geography - Health this semester, Geography the next. I'm doing ok in this class.

Lunch - its just lunch, nothing special

Period 5 - Mandarin Chinese 2 - gonna take some language classes and chinese seems interesting. who knows, maybe Ichiro might invite me to go to Beijing with him?

Period 6 - Gym - i hate this class the most. the teacher is nice and i like playing sports, but its all these PERVERTED GUYS that bother me all the time. seriously, if i dont look behind me every few minutes, some guy would touch my breasts or butt. sick perverts! >.<

End of School
btw, i got my 1st quarter gpa: 3.83. i had a B in Adv. Precalculus, thanks to some silly mistakes on several quizzes. and a B in Gym, just because i complained about those perverts. >.< they dont listen to me
apparently, Period 0 is just for filling up graduation requirements, and Adv. Precalculus gets an extra 1 gpa point. Yay!

ok then i have to walk home. normally i go with a friend or two who live near me. by the time i get home, its already around 3:10 pm. i hurry up on my homework and when i can get on the computer, i'll sign on. normally cant, cuz most of my homework dont require a computer.

sometimes i have friends come over, but not too often. i'd say ichiro comes here more than my other friends do, but even so, he cant visit me often.

i normally take a shower before going to school, right after gym class in the girl's locker room showers, and at home after school. that way if i cant take a shower at one of those times and one of another time, i'd at least still have 1 shower a day, keeping me clean
i guess im a one of those girls who really pay attention to her appearance and get worried over calorie intake.

dinner is moderate. I eat enough just to feel good, but i dont keep eating until i'm full.

anyways, i go to sleep afterwards. many girls like to completely protect themselves with a lot of PJs and locking windows. I just lock my door, open a gap of the window to have air circulation, and then i just sleep on my bed. no matter the weather, i dont wear PJs. all i think i need to sleep is a good bed, a good blanket, bra and panties. yup, i sleep wearing those. so what? i feel comfortable to wear loosely, which explains me wearing miniskirts to school. (i feel very very safe when Ichiro is around too. i like my big bro)

Well, not much to talk about now.

*hugs*

EDIT: I believe Adv. classes here are called Honors classes at Ichiro's high school"

"event","You Scored as Character Player

The Character Player enjoys creating in-depth characters with distinct and rich personalities. He identifies closely with his characters, feeling detached from the game if he doesn't. He takes creative pride in exploring different characters, often making each new one radically different than others he's played. The Character Player bases his decisions on his character's psychology first and foremost. He may view rules as a necessary evil at best, preferring sessions in which the dice never come out of their bags. For the Character Player, the greatest reward comes from experiencing the game from the emotional perspective of an interesting character.

You Scored as Storyteller

The Storyteller is in it for the plot: the sense of mystery and the fun of participating in a narrative that has the satisfying arc of a good book or movie. He enjoys interacting with well-defined NPCs, even preferring antagonists who have genuine motivations and personality to mere monsters. To the Storyteller, the greatest reward of the game is participating in a compelling story with interesting and unpredictable plot threads, in which his actions and those of his fellow characters determine the resolution.

Monday you can fall apart

It's Friday, I'm in love</b>

Saturday, wait
Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitates

Dressed up to the eyes
It's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
And just smiling at the sound
As sleek as a shriek
Spinning round and round
Always take a big bite
It's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday, I'm in love

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday, I don't care about you

Also there is no shipping if you get 3-5 day. There are taxes $10.72 if you live in Texas. It's the same product number so it's the exact same thing.

If you are looking for an external HDD via USB 2.0 for backing up data and you have been putting it off, this is a ridiculous deal you should pounce on. I've used one of these for storing my personal crap videos/music/data at work so I don't use ""company resources"" and it's been going strong now for 6 months now without any issue. I stream from it and transfer data from and to it all the time. I use Ubuntu at work and I tested it out on a Windows XP machine and it works fine for both.  Keep in mind it's USB 2.0 so it's not blazing fast but it does the job well for what I need.

Seriously I've not seen this product with this kind of deal ever."

Coal shipments via train make up 50% of all rail traffic in the country. One of the larger coal mines can produce up to 30 miles of train cars of coal in 24 hours. There are 600 coal fired electricity plants in the country. A large plant can burn through a whole train load in just 12 hours. The largest coal plant can produce 1300 megawatts/hr. It takes 1 lb of coal to power your TV for 4 hours. The average household uses 9.5 tons of coal per year. 52% of all electricity consumed in the USA comes from coal. This is just a few of the facts behind ""base load power"" i.e. continuously supplied power. The economy in the USA is continuing to grow and hence more base load power is needed. If an alternative that is also a ""base load power"" isn't found then coal power will continue to grow. Powerful lobbyists and industries control certain senators in order to insure that the coal industry remains relatively untouched. Clean Coal is a fiasco all to itself and has not been proven so it is not an answer.

Watch PBS Frontline report called ""Heat"" there is so much information besides the coal industry in the report. Very eye opening.

<lj-cut text=""Anime Watchers Continue"">

So I have been watching a lot of anime recently. About 8 series or so at one time. Thank you Fansubbing! This season there are four in particular that are so strange in all sorts of ways and yet are very good that need to be mentioned.

Watching these four anime in one sitting puts one in a very odd mood. The Supernatural Element, the Mystery/Intrigue, the Action/Combat and the Character Interactions not to mention the undertone of death is very enthralling and yet draining. I am completely sucked into these anime series and watching each new episode of each anime together in one sitting enhances and prolongs the emotional impact of each. Now I save each new week's worth of episodes until I have them all and then watch them together. I would suggest trying it if you don't mind having the odd feeling for a while. I suspect your odd feeling may be different than mine. *mischievous grin*

This is everything that Newsweek discovered about the campaign within both parties. Due to their own guidelines they did not post this information until now.

Within the article:
<i>The disclosures are among many revealed in ""How He Did It, 2008,"" the latest installment in NEWSWEEK's Special Election Project, which was first published in 1984. As in the previous editions, ""How He Did It, 2008"" is an inside, behind-the-scenes account of the presidential election produced by a special team of reporters working for more than a year on an embargoed basis and detached from the weekly magazine and Newsweek.com. Everything the project team learns is kept confidential until the day after the polls close.</i>

Here are just a few excerpts of the highlights portion of the huge special report.
<i>
# Palin launched her attack on Obama's association with William Ayers, the former Weather Underground bomber, before the campaign had finalized a plan to raise the issue. McCain's advisers were working on a strategy that they hoped to unveil the following week, but McCain had not signed off on it, and top adviser Mark Salter was resisting.

# McCain also was reluctant to use Obama's incendiary pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, as a campaign issue. The Republican had set firm boundaries: no Jeremiah Wright; no attacking Michelle Obama; no attacking Obama for not serving in the military. McCain balked at an ad using images of children that suggested that Obama might not protect them from terrorism. Schmidt vetoed ads suggesting that Obama was soft on crime (no Willie Hortons). And before word even got to McCain, Schmidt and Salter scuttled a ""celebrity"" ad of Obama dancing with talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres (the sight of a black man dancing with a lesbian was deemed too provocative).

# Obama was never inclined to choose Sen. Hillary Clinton as his running mate, not so much because she had been his sometime bitter rival on the campaign trail, but because of her husband. Still, as Hillary's name came up in veep discussions, and Obama's advisers gave all the reasons why she should be kept off the ticket, Obama would stop and ask, ""Are we sure?"" He needed to be convinced one more time that the Clintons would do more harm than good. McCain, on the other hand, was relieved to face Sen. Joe Biden as the veep choice, and not Hillary Clinton, whom the McCain camp had truly feared.</i>

There is much much more. Chapters keep getting added so look at them all. So I urge you to take a look at that special report from Newsweek and perhaps learn a little bit about what is happening behind the scenes of an election or at least this election."

http://blueherald.com/2008/11/palin-didnt-know-africa-is-a-continent/

Is this for real? Seriously? Is this woman really that insane, nuts, off the deep end bonkers? This shows you just how inept and ill prepared the McCain campaign was. McCain obviously didn't control his campaign all that well. It looks like it was controlling him. Thank goodness Obama won simply because I would not want Palin anywhere near any sort of national executive power. Like I said before the election about a month or more ago. McCain by himself had me on the fence for a while, Palin had be leaping off the fence and running for the Obama camp as fast as I could. No one like her should EVER EVER be in the executive branch.

Republicans I implore you. No matter how much you want to grab the uneducated rural religious right voters in your party, electing someone like Palin into the second highest office in the land is a great disservice to your country, your party and your intelligence. It's just plain dumb. Next time instead of blindly following your party an accepting someone like that, do yourself a favor and your party a favor and question your candidates. Use your own common sense judgment and for your own sakes do some investigative journalism on them before putting your approval on a candidate.

<A HREF=""http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/04/obama.transcript/"">Obama's Victory Speech (Script)</A>

Obama's speech brought me to tears with emotion I am not afraid or embarrassed to say. The man is such a gifted speaker I can only assume that people felt this way when listening to other great speakers in history. When I saw Jesse Jackson crying it brought to mind something so incredible in that this man who was a very good friend of Martin Luther King Jr., who fought for Civil Rights with him, who heard MLK Jr. speak, one of the greatest speakers in history, was not only moved by Obama but also has lived to see an African American elected as President of the United States of America. That moment made me realize without a shadow of a doubt just how incredible, historic and amazing this moment in history is. I am proud to have had my part no matter how infinitesimal it may have been. I am proud to be an American.

<A HREF=""http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/04/mccain.transcript/"">McCain's Concession Speech (Script)</A>

McCain's concession speech was also a good speech and very humbling. I thought what he said was exactly what needed to be said to start the healing between the two parties. I had moments of anger at how the crowd jeered when Obama's name was mentioned but to see McCain calm them down and to point out that unity was needed made me nod and appreciate the message. This was the McCain that I admired from 2000 to 2005. This was the McCain that I had hoped would have came out and stayed out in the campaign. Unfortunately it didn't and instead of McCain controlling his campaign, the party and the campaign controlled McCain. It saddens me that he had to change in order for his own party to support him. I hope he spends his remaining years in the Senate as the old McCain that I grew to admire. I hope he puts his efforts towards bridging the aisle and helping to bring unity to our nation.

<b>The campaign and election finally comes to a close...</b>

I am elated at the results of the election but also mentally exhausted from this 22 month campaign. I've always been mildly interested in politics but these last four years or so have pushed me to learn more and in greater details the workings and happenings of government and politics. I've read more articles and blogs on politics than I care to over the past 6 months alone much less the last two years. Even though the election is over I know that things aren't going to magically fix themselves in this country. I know the economy, the deficit, the job market, oil usage and the whole host of issues will continue to be issues of great importance for years to come. I know that President Elect Barack Obama is going to have a very difficult time attempting to fix the wrongs of the past administration. The hole has been dug so deep now that filling it back in is all that we can do before we can build on top of it. So I have no misconceptions of the future of this country in the next two, three or four years. I know it's going to be hard for many US citizens and it might get worse before it gets better. I expect this and I hope that most of America also realizes that the road back to recover is not an easy one. I am very glad that part of Obama's speeches has always pointed this out and has not sugar coated the crisis and problems that this country faces at this very moment. Perhaps it is these very words that inspired me the most to vote for Obama and put my energy in support and prayers for a single man in hopes that he could bring about a solution to at least a few of our countries problems. It's a message of inspiration and hope that Obama has given the people of this nation. I however also know that this gift could easily be used to inspire people in a direction that may not help America. It's a powerful talent that Obama has and it has been used for both good and bad by historical figures throughout the world. I can only hope that for our sake that it is used for the good of this country. I have, in these past few months, feverishly supported the campaign and have attempted to inspire and remind people to vote, to be wary of their rights and to make certain their voice is heard. I hope my efforts were effective even in the smallest sense. Now we look towards the future and we must remain vigilant. If we see injustice or if we disagree with the decisions made by our government, it is our responsibility to correct them and to bring forward movements to right the wrong. Because simply put, our inaction, regardless of our beliefs, is a quiet support of what is done in government. It is only through action, debate and discussion can we the people remain free.

I look forward to these next four years. I really do have hope for once. It's been a long time since I've felt it. Thank you to everyone who voted.

Cheers."

Babies have been conceived, born and are close to saying Dada or Momma at this point. Well in about 12 hours or so we should be getting most of the results in and unless it's close a winner should be close to be declared.

I found a funny political editorial cartoon that sums up this campaign rather well.

Uncle Sam and Liberty are two great characters. Sure it's a comic strip but it really seems to hit home for some reason. I can't help but feel that the emotions invoked with these particular strips seems to be something that a lot of people are feeling in some way and can easily relate to it.

The ability to Vote is perhaps one of the greatest rights we have as citizens of a democracy. Those that attempt to change the vote numbers by unscrupulous means are not just criminals or cheats but also enemies of democracy. Regardless of Party affiliations everyone should be inspiring others to go out and vote not preventing them from doing so, such as what has recently happened on college campus in Virginia and Pennsylvania. Make a difference and exercise your right and privilege as an American citizen. 

Why wait till Nov 4th and wait in the long lines then? When you could go early and wait in much shorter lines or even no lines at all. Don't wait till the last minute. Vote Now!"

"event","Here is the written transcript of the debate. Just in case you didn't understand half of what was said due to the stopping and starting and odd pauses and even more odd phrasing and sudden tangents. Once you get past the sexy appeal of Palin, she is as bad if not worse than George W. Bush. Just read the transcript and see that she really did not answer many questions at all and she pretty much winged most of the answers and then quickly went on to the party stance. The only reason the media is saying she did well was because she is an ""F"" student that suddenly made a ""C-"" on a test. When your standards are that low any improvement is considered a good thing. It's like clapping for special needs kid when they do something clever. You aren't doing it because the particular something was outstanding. You are clapping because it was good for that special needs child and you don't want to hurt their feelings. It kind of reminds me of a quote from the rather raunchy show on Comedy Central called Drawn Together. Palin is Retarded Hot. Good looking but still doesn't have the knowledge nor skill to seem knowledgeable. I guess that Communications/Journalism degree didn't pay off all that well in the speaking under pressure event.

"event","This debate was some what typical from the stance of a viewer looking at both parties. Biden catered to the middle and upper middle class and detailed his answers for the more educated viewer base. Palin catered to the middle and lower middle class but mainly to those in rural and country areas which are typically the red states. Her answers were short and direct but quickly went off on a tangent to support her party lines and were not detailed. Her mannerisms and verbiage were clearly aimed at the lesser educated American or to the American that just wants their neighbor in the second highest office in the land.

I believe the script for the debates that will be published soon enough will show without a shadow of a doubt who was better equipped for deliver detailed answers. 

Biden showed that his 35 years as senator and his positions as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and also his time as Chairman of the judiciary Committee make him much more qualified to speak to the country on issues that surround them now. I might add that he also has small town city experience with his stint on City Council and he is also educated and has a double Bachelor of Arts Degree in History and Political Science from University of Delaware and a Juris Doctor (Law Degree) from Syracuse University College of Law.

Palin on the other hand can only draw on information which she was couched on in the last few weeks and her experience as Governor of Alaska for the last almost two years and before that Mayor of Wasilla, Alaska for six years. Before that she served on Wasilla's City Council for four years. She has no other experience in politics outside that. She has attended five colleges over six years and finally graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Communication/Journalism from University of Idaho.

Biden has her on experience, has her on education and has her on his ability to advise the President. His wealth of knowledge, his assertion on the Senate floor and his industrial small town roots give him a large edge in the New England states and the Auto industry. Palin really has nothing but Energy experience since she has been in the pocket of the oil companies soon after becoming Mayor and has been fighting on their behalf for years now. She has some judiciary spending pluses for her interesting usage of Ebay and her cuts to spending in Alaska. Although some of what she cut were much needed programs that would have helped the poor and health care. She also has charisma in a way that no other candidate can invoke called sex appeal. She is a pretty woman who can do the wink and smile and get away with it. She is hoping that her likability in this way and her flagrant usage of ""Hockey Mom and Joe Six-pack"" is going to weigh more on the voters than her actual knowledge and experience.

Multiple times she even contradicted herself in the debate saying one thing and then wording her next statement to discredit herself. One example of her answers to diplomacy with Iran. She said that the US should not meet with Iran without certain conditions being met first. Then the next statement she agrees with Kissenger's advise, as quoted by the moderator, that diplomacy is very important and they need to start discourse. So how can you start a discourse if you won't even start the conversation? Hence the contradiction. She was rather flustered at that moment and was searching for a return that sounded half way intelligent and ended up agreeing when she should have said what she said earlier. It just shows us that she is very uneducated in many important political matters and should stick to Energy.

Palin is a very poor choice as a VP when it comes to advising on most political subjects. She doesn't have the experience to draw on and would be better suited as McCain's Secretary of Energy than his Vice President. What we are seeing here is another Dan Quayle. She is being picked as VP merely to secure certain constituent votes. The religious right, oil supports and those women that want a women in office and don't care what that women supports or represents. 

At first I was entertaining the idea of voting for McCain this year because I know that what he is doing now is a front that he had to put up in order to get the Republican nomination. I'm fairly certain that some of the strong viewpoints he had in the past will come back up and hence he will be a more liberally minded Republican in a year or so. However once he choose Palin as his VP and after I did some research on who she was and what she stood for, I immediately and quickly went over to the Obama side. She scares me how religiously fanatical, inexperienced and a puppet she is by big oil.

I'm not going to go into more detail as to why I dislike Palin but you can read about in my LJ entry on the topic <A HREF=""http://kilroy0097.livejournal.com/130590.html"">here</A>."

Each time they are forced to prevent those cracks only to have others discovered. I'm wishing they would make these things more secure before they even attempt to use them in elections.

""The Security Group at the University of California in Santa Barbara has released the video that shows the attacks carried out against the Sequoia voting system. The video shows an attack where a virus-like software spreads across the voting system. The coolest part of the video is the one that shows how the 'brainwashed' voting terminals can use different techniques to change the votes even when a paper audit trail is used. Pretty scary stuff. The video is absolute proof that these types of attacks are indeed feasible and not just a conspiracy theory. Also, the part that shows how the 'tamperproof' seals can be completely bypassed in seconds is very funny (and quite disturbing at the same time).""

<hr width=60%>

(I've kind of wrote this over the night on and off as I was doing other things. So it might not flow as nicely as it could have.)

Now there has been some controversy on Palin being picked as the VP pick for McCain. Many people on both sides of the issue and in the middle have their opinions on that pick and on her as a person. I'm just another voice in the sea of the internet.

The very first thoughts that went through my head when she was chosen and it came across the wire was first, ""Who they heck is Palin?... Oh the Governor of Alaska. Um ok.. Well I guess they really want the woman vote badly."". Immediately I was thinking, of course, Hillary is no longer in the race so you have to go after the voters that would vote for a woman in office at this level regardless of political stance. But I know not all woman are going to vote for her just because of her sex. So I watched and listened and tried to find a reason that McCain chose her. Three big things popped out at me and none of them are her experience as a Governor of Alaska (Less than 2 years worth) nor her time as a Mayor of a city whose population hovers around the 10,000 mark. The three things were Guns, Oil and Religion. She gains the NRA vote, she gets the backing of Big Oil and she secures the Evangelical Religious vote which is one of the largest religious branches in the US and also the rest of the conservative fanatical Christian vote. She is exactly what McCain's campaign has been missing. The large portion of voters that ""W"" won over four and eight years ago.

Now I'm no where near in the beliefs that would be require to vote for Palin. In fact even though I entertained voting Republican this year because I actually do like McCain, Palin immediately threw my vote to Obama this time around. I don't think she has the experience to be President. It's honestly a concern of mine given McCain's age. What is something should happen to him? What if he gets ill or dies in office? We are left with this Conservative, Ultra Religious, Right Wing Radical that has no real foreign affairs experience and no National Congressional experience as a President. 

Why do I call her conservative and ultra religious? 

Well her Pro-Life stances on Abortion are fanatical. Oh you've been raped by your father and pregnant with his child? Sorry you can't have an abortion. Oh you were raped by some random guy on the street as you walked home? Sorry you have to suffer through those 9 months and have a child you despise. Her own 17 year old daughter is pregnant, out of wed lock because we know that's horrible in the eyes of most conservative Christians, and yet she asks that the media please let this be and respect her family's privacy and respect their own decisions. Yet she is in support of a bill that abolishes all abortion in all cases, except for when the mother's life is endangered, and so therefore does NOT respect the the decisions of other families with different beliefs. <b>How hypocritical.</b> She is also personally against testing to see if a child has an incurable illness before it is born. That parents should find out, like she did, that their child has Down Syndrome and can't possibly know ahead of time to prepare for it instead of having to struggle to find the needed care immediately. Oh but she is afraid someone will ""abort"" their baby some how in the 3rd trimester. I personally don't see how a doctor could agree to do that at that point. I am Pro-Choice but I have my limits. The testing is only to make certain the child does not have an illness that can't be repaired or prepared for after child birth. Thankfully she hasn't suggested passing a law about that.. Yet.

Her stance on education is a mixed bag. She has good ideas as far as improving education in the school systems through organization and funding them appropriately however she is avid supporter of Creationism being taught concurrently with Evolution and she believes in Intelligent Design. Since when did education of these ideas that are better taught in Sunday School at Church or Bible Study suddenly become required knowledge for children? This would be imposing your belief system onto children who themselves and their parents have no say. Nothing stopping the religious conservative group of teaching their own children Creationism or having after school study programs at local churches for such education, but to have it mandatory in the education system is religious bigotry. 

<b>Amendment 1 - Freedom of Religion, Press, Expression. Ratified 12/15/1791. - Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</b>

If she is going to claim the Right to Bear Arms as a Constitutional Right, then you better damn well expect people to claim Freedom of Religion as one as well. She goes against the very tenants that this country was founded upon. Hence I throughly and avidly disagree with her belief.

Her stance against Gay Marriage and her stance against giving Gay couples any sort of benefit or rights due to their sexual preference. I am firm believer that if two members of the same sex love each other enough to be married under the eyes of God or at least contractually under the laws of men then they should gain the same privileges and rights of any married couple. The segregation of gay couples simply because her interpretation of scripture and religion dictates it's not correct is once again forcing her religious belief upon society. See the First Amendment of the Constitution.

I actually agree with some of her stances on Energy and Oil/Gas Production. However I am wary of her stance because she was for Big Oil before it was ""Politically Correct"" to be for Big Oil. She has always supported Oil drilling off shore and has been working on that infamous Oil Pipeline to be built for a while now. That has been a Republican stance for a long long time and for her it would increase jobs which is a good thing in Alaska. Indeed the national actually needs this increased production as a stop gap method to insure economic stability but only until a viable alternative fuel can be found and mass produced in order to replace our dependency on oil. 
However there has been no talk at all about her stance against government intervention with Big Oil and requirements for them to improve their efficiency so there is less pollution and less waste. No talk about government requirement for Big Oil to allocation a larger percentage of their vastly increasing profit margin on more research into alternative fuels. Oh and she also believes that nothing about Global Warming is man made. Not even a little bit. She opposed protections for salmon from mining contamination. She sued US government to stop listing polar bear as endangered. She encourages timber cutting, strip mining, drilling without adequate regulations, tapping ANWAR and commercial fishing. It must be all in God's plan to make the Eskimo and animals in the north suffer. Yeah, that's the ticket. God loves suffering and he loves hurricanes and dying coral reefs and depleted fisheries and dead algae beds and deforestation oh and the extinction of species. Yea all that is the awesome plan of God. I really despise people who hide behind an excuse to make themselves feel better and justified in their belief system.

Now I like that she is for government reform and wants to cut unnecessary spending and pass an Ethics policy in Congress. However at the same time she supported the bridge to nowhere which was just a ploy to make jobs and get access to a larger budget appropriation. Not a very good spending decision. They she put the Governor jet on Ebay. Curious question, ""Where did the money go for that?""

<hr width=60%>

There are other things that I like about her but the things I don't like about her far outweigh the parts that are good. Take for example the following quotes which have been bantered around the news media recently which the GOP definitely doesn't like happening at this state in the election.

Gov. Sarah Palin speaking at the Wasilla Assembly of God. The stuff below to me seems rather scary. Not so much as that she wants the assembly to pray for the troops but more because of the way she says it. I think we've had enough Crusades in history, thank you.

On the War in Iraq:
""Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right. Also, for this country, that our leaders, our national leaders, are sending them out on a task that is from God. That's what we have to make sure that we're praying for, that there is a plan and that that plan is God's plan.""

And about her Oil Pipeline project:
""I think God's will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas line built, so pray for that.""

<A HREF=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmlJfkhyNdc"">Infamous Palin Church Video: Wasilla Church Controversy Pt 1</A>
<A HREF=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGFWNq9JGMY"">Infamous Palin Church Video: Wasilla Church Controversy Pt 2</A>

And when her church said this quote about the War in Iraq:

""<i>What you see in a terrorist -- that's called the invisible enemy. There has always been an invisible enemy. What you see in Iraq, basically, is a manifestation of what's going on in this unseen world called the spirit world. ... We need to think like Jesus thinks. We are in a time and a season of war, and we need to think like that. We need to develop that instinct. We need to develop as believers the instinct that we are at war, and that war is contending for your faith. ... Jesus called us to die. You're worried about getting hurt? He's called us to die. Listen, you know we can't even follow him unless you are willing to give up your life. ... I believe that Jesus himself operated from that position of war mode. Everyone say ""war mode."" Now you say, wait a minute Ed, he's like the good shepherd, he's loving all the time and he's kind all the time. Oh yes he is -- but I also believe that he had a part of his thoughts that knew that he was in a war.</i>""


I for one would like all the Christian Fanatics to please take all their guns that they possess, if they own any, and please buy a plane ticket to the closest airport that will allow access to Iraq. Then proceed to enter said country and preach your word there. Since Jesus asked for you to die, then go ahead and put yourself into that situation so you can feel what it's like to die for your cause instead of simply preach it and let others dies for you. At least then we can bring back the troops that may or may not believe the crap that you preach and allow them to choose what they die for.

I've watched this video about eight or nine times now over the last five or so days. The message is brings is different for many people but to me it's a message of unity over the globe. I hope it makes you feel happy and joyful as it did me.

The video is a collaboration of video shots taken on Matt's trip around the world. More can be read about his trip and his still on going journal at: http://www.wherethehellismatt.com

The song in that video is quite amazing and is named ""Praan"". It can be bought through mp3 download at Amazon <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/Praan/dp/B001B8R3MS/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1214978100&sr=8-2"">HERE</A>. 
I bought it and it's now on permanent rotation with my other songs.

<B>The Song ""Praan"" </B>

The lyrics for the song are are based off a poem in native tongue. 

The poem is called Stream of Life and is from the collection of works called, <A HREF=""http://www.schoolofwisdom.com/gitanjali.html"">Gitanjali</A> penned by <A HREF=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore"">Rabindranath Tagore</A> who amongst his noble pursuits was also Asia's first Nobel laureate when he won the 1913 Nobel Prize in Literature.

The song itself is sung by Palbasha Siddique.

Below is the Poem ""Stream of Life"" translated into English.

<b>""Stream of Life""</b>
<i>
The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day
runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures.

It is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth
in numberless blades of grass
and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers.

It is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth
and of death, in ebb and in flow.

I feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life.
And my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment.
</i>

I hope you enjoyed this as much as I have.

Cheers."

In other news I see I have not posted for 17 weeks or something like that.

I still work at Texas A&M Unversity.

I applied and got the IT Team Leader position for my shift. A fancy way of saying I'm now the supervisor for 3rd shift.

Married for 7 months. Except for this ring we really don't act any different.

Saved up money for a new computer and decided instead to spend that money to go to Colorado this July for vacation. It's not England but it will do nicely. My reasoning is that the computer will always be there to get in the future. Plus with all the new hardware coming out the last part of this year and beginning of next I might as well wait to get less obsolete components. The vacation however is a limited opportunity. With gas prices and the economy for traveling going the way it is going, it may prevent us from going to Colorado if I wait too long. Priorities!

Hopefully in 2009 we will be getting a house. Need to cross my fingers on that one.

My van has recently become ill and after spending lots of money on it the A/C is now busted. 

So now you are caught up. Hope all is well in your neck of the world.

The study concluded that the statements ""were part of an orchestrated campaign that effectively galvanized public opinion and, in the process, led the nation to war under decidedly false pretenses.""

The study was posted Tuesday on the Web site of the Center for Public Integrity, which worked with the Fund for Independence in Journalism.

Sun @ 2, 4:30 & 7 pm

<b>Location: The Paramount Theatre</b>

<b>Harrison Ford, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer. Directed by Ridley Scott.</b>
The Final Cut, is Director Ridley Scott's latest edit (with four minutes of added footage) of the influential 1982 science fiction film loosely based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Phillip K. Dick. The film depicts a dystopian Los Angeles in November 2019 in which genetically manufactured beings called replicants, physically identical to humans, are used for dangerous and degrading work in Earth's ""off-world colonies."" Replicants became illegal on Earth after a bloody mutiny. Specialist police units - blade runners - hunt down and ""retire"" (i.e. kill) escaped replicants on Earth. The plot primarily focuses on a particularly brutal and cunning group of replicants hiding in Los Angeles and a semi-retired blade runner, named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment.

"event","So wow this video apparently was created a year or more ago and I've just now come across it. It is a rather sound argument on why humanity needs to act now in prevention of global warming. It does not provide proof that humanity is causing it nor does it provide a solution on how to fix it if indeed humanity is causing it. What is does provide is a ironclad argument as to why humanity can't afford not to act in the prevention of global warming with the assumption that humanity is in fact causing it. Because the alternative is too terrifying to want.

So please watch the video and if you can agree with it and can't find any fault in it then please pass it on to your friends and discuss it with them and if you are truly motivated then research the subject a bit more and see about maybe getting our government to act on it as well.

SUMMER PRESS TOUR: 'Farscape,' 'BSG' webisodes

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Frell yeah!

The ""Farscape"" franchise will live on as a live-action Web series. Sci Fi Channel executive Craig Engler confirmed that the company has closed a deal with The Jim Henson Company for a 10-episode webisode series. So far no stars or writers are signed to appear and no story plotted, but if successful, the project could lead to re-igniting the franchise on the air.

Also in development, ""Farscape"" actor Ben Browder and producer/director Andrew Prowse are creating the six-hour miniseries ""Going Homer,"" a modern take on ""The Odyssey"" about a 12-year-old boy who sees Greek and Roman deities walking among us.

This fall, Sci Fi Channel will launch ""Battlestar Galactica"" minisodes related to fall's ""Battlestar"" movie ""Razor,"" debuting Nov. 24. Eight episodes running two or three minutes each will first air on Sci Fi Channel (air dates/times yet to be determined) and later at SciFi.com.

The minisodes tell the story of a young Commander Adama (Nico Cortez) who discovers a dangerous Cylon weapon during the Cylon War that will come back to haunt him and his crew 40 years later. The shorts were writte by Michael Taylor and directed by Wayne Rose and Felix Alcala.

The film ""Battlestar Galactica: Razor"" will show viewers Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) on his first mission as commander of the Battlestar Pegasus and will reveal how former Pegasus leader Admiral Cain (Michelle Forbes) dealt with the original Cylon attack on the Colonies.

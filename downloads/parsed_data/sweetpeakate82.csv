<DIV class=RTE><STRONG><FONT color=#993399>And maybe i am damned, but i love him still...with all of my fucking broken heart, i love him so much that he will never know what that love means, he will never know what it feels like to have him know he is my best friend, and he will never see me cry over him.&nbsp; But he is content in that, he is content in knowing not that he hurt me but in the fact that he will never know what it did to me.&nbsp; I lost my best friend that night, i lost a love deeper than any i had ever known, and i lost the one thing in my life that wasn't suppose to leave.&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG></DIV>

So Gizmos has a little brother, his name is Reises. He had made me extremely happy. Gizmo is a little jealous as of yet, but she can't always be my only princess.&nbsp; So now I have a little prince.&nbsp; He is sitting on my computer desk at the moment playing with a very important piece of jewelery and a pen, he is also thinking he needs to learn how to type.&nbsp; He is the cutest thing in the whole world.&nbsp; </P>

"event","<FONT color=#000066>Someone once called me Kate the ""brave.""&nbsp; I don't understand how they came to that conclusion because I am nothing but a coward always running away from things, always hiding behind the portrait of someone who they want to be.&nbsp; I'm just Kate.&nbsp; I am just the girl who fell in love with a boy and decided that maybe, just maybe, this one time it would work.&nbsp; I followed him or more likely moved to give this a shot...Chicago and Kate...for all those who really know me, know I don't fit here.&nbsp; But I came and I live here, trapped in a world that created because I thought I knew what love was.&nbsp; And I didn't, I was so blinded by his lies, by his search to use that I believed and I fell for a man who was not a waste of my time, but a waste of his own.&nbsp; That's what's sad, he didn't waste my time.....I fell in love with him and I cherished what we talked about, how we were, but he wasted his own time by using me, by using more than me, to fullfill this ultimate need to be desired.&nbsp; So when he said Kate the brave...I didn't know how to react because I am not brave.&nbsp; I keep hiding behind this mask that I like to call myself and I don't come out for hardly anyone, even Chris.&nbsp; I sit here and hide like a scared child afraid that the things she loved the most will get taken away one by one....and guess what, they did.&nbsp; I lost T.J. because I was too busy trying to hide from him that I didn't see him slipping away.&nbsp; I lost Jared as a friend because I couldnt' give him more, I kept hiding my feelings for him because I didn't know what they were.&nbsp; And finally, I lost Chris because he was stupid and used me.&nbsp; Most importantly, somewhere in my quest to find love, to find the one love I would do anything for, I lost myself.&nbsp; I don't know who I am anymore.&nbsp; I don't know why I am here or why I make the decisions i do, I just did it and without thought, I lost everything I was, everything I wanted to be, and everything I could have been.&nbsp; I think I started losing myself when I lost T.J.&nbsp; He was the love unrealized, he was the one that I would do anything to get back in my life, and I mean anything.&nbsp; And yet, here's Jason, the funny thing is, I haven't hid from him because there was never a need to.&nbsp; He became a friend and I let him know who I was, not who they made me, but who I really was.&nbsp; And he sees it, he sees my flaws and hears my complaints and smells my morning breath, and does nothing but smile and thank me for allowing him to stay.&nbsp; So Kate the brave was not very brave, she moved to a city, who cares.&nbsp; She's alone....who cares...if Kate was really brave, she would have chased T.J. and she would have begged to get him back.&nbsp; But now all I can do is let Jas in, suffer the hurt if that's what is meant to be, but let him in and fight like hell not lose him.&nbsp; That would the bravest thing I have ever done.&nbsp; </FONT>"

<P><FONT color=#ff6666>Would I like to be with Jason?&nbsp; Sure, he's great.&nbsp; He's the biggest sweetheart in the world, he treats me so well, he would never ever hurt me, and he likes me for me, not for who he wants me to be.&nbsp; I enjoy talking to him and want to be wrapped up in his arms.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6666>Would I like to be with Chris?&nbsp; Sure, he's great.&nbsp; We've had 8 months of getting to know each other, the first four months were awesome, the last four months were hell.&nbsp; Does that mean I don't love him?&nbsp; No, I love Chris, I just don't know what to do about him sometimes.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6666>Would I like to be with Jared?&nbsp; Sure, he's great.&nbsp; He's nice, friendly, always offers a shoulder to cry on.&nbsp; He's a really great friend and a really great person but he wants a marriage and a family, which are good things and things I want, but I don't know if I want them this year.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6666>Would i like to be with TJ?&nbsp; TJ is the love&nbsp;I lost, the only person who ever knew the real me, who ever let me show the real me to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;I lost him, so as great as he is and as good of a match as we were, we just can't work it out.&nbsp; So my heart may feel like wanting him, needing him, being with him, my head just can't do it anymore!</FONT></P>

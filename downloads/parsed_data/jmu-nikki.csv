<P><EM></EM>&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM>I've found the old live journal I started in October. Fun stuff eh? Yeah, so i'll try to use it and keep it updated reguarly.&nbsp; I'm warning you now, i'm a horrible speller so don't make fun. I just never had lots of spelling tests in the early years. </EM></P>
<P><EM>So to start on, my semester so far has been pretty steady. Aside from the snow days, I've been to all my classes. My goal is not to skip any this year. We'll see how easy that is... :)</EM></P>
<P><EM>TBS is going well - I encourage anyone who is interested in band service and a great group of girls to hang out with to come join us. Rush is just about over, but there is always the fall. It's amazing. Sisters are such a blessing and I've been blessed with two biological sisters all my life, but to have even more sisters at school, I'm just so lucky :) Please feel free to call, IM or email me if you're interested in TBS :) It's a great time.</EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>so I have a few links for you that you may wanna check out:</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>cool online radio: </STRONG><A href=""http://launch.yahoo.com/launchcast/stations/default.asp""><STRONG>http://launch.yahoo.com/launchcast/stations/default.asp</STRONG></A><STRONG>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>a neat little site: </STRONG><A href=""http://www.suite101.com/files/mysites/AskAlice/Clock.htm""><STRONG>http://www.suite101.com/files/mysites/AskAlice/Clock.htm</STRONG></A></EM></P>
<P><EM>(these will be updated frequently. My aunt rocks - she sends me neat stuff all the time. I'll post jokes too if I ever get any sent to me :))</EM></P>
<P><EM>what else is new? ... well, this chrismtas was enjoyable. Not only did I go home to Norway to see my wonderful family I got to go to snorkel with Orcas in the north seas (on the shortest day of the year) then went to Ireland with the marching band to perform in Dublin castle and in their parade (which consequently, no one in Dublin knew about...) - How lucky can one girl get? However, I have to say... I'm tired of airports. I've spent more time in the Copenhagen airport than I have my dorm room... and also, 5 hour layovers are not fun. </EM></P>
<P><EM>I had breakfast with my Big, Steve and I ate dinner and studied with my Big, Kathy the other night. Even more lucky - I got to spend time with TWO bigs in one week! :) WEEEE! :) </EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Movie of the week: Two can play that Game </STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>Song of the week: Someday - Nickelback</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM>ok that's all I have to say for right now - I'll keep you posted and hopefully will find some cooler stuff to talk about :)</EM></P>"

"event","Ok - a little note - Vizing with Chris was not a bad thing - :) I sure did make is sound like it was! :) It was a very nice lunch at chick fil a and at the end he wrote a quote in my book that was very inspirational for the day :) Just wanted you all to know that ;)

"event","Ok - so today hasn't exactly been the best day. But it's all good. 

First off, I had a viz with Chris from KKPsi - His quote that he gave me was: 

""The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather in lack of will."" - unknown

It was perfect especially with all the crap i'm putting up with by taking Physics - but like I said, it's all good :)

The other wonderful thing that happened was the discovery of an obsenely high cell phone bill... I sort of knew that incoming calls cost on mobile phones in the US but not THAT much... grrr - The United States has a bit of catching up to do with European cell phone plans and models... OH WELL! :)

Luckily, I have some wonderful friends who helped me through today, as well as my wonderful father, who actually told me I would call him up at about midterm and cry down the phone saying ""I can't do this, I'm not smart enough"". I hate it when parents are right! Emilie prayed for me which definitely helped calm me down, Forest went through his usual ritual of yelling at me to pull myself together and telling me all the options I had and encouraging me beyond comprehension. And at last my wonderful boyfriend's sweet words of encouragement and praise were the icing on the cake letting me know that Maybe I can do this... :) - Thanks to all of you - I'm truly blessed to be surrounded by such wonderful people.

ON A LIGHTER NOTE! :)
- i'm over half way done with my vizes
- I understand my calc HW
- I'm going to breakfast with Em and Steph
- I might me moving to Old Mill next year! :) :) :) :)
- TBS rocks :)

I want to let you in on a few sites I enjoy when I've got time (HAHAH - in other words, the summer time)

- http://www.bored.com - this place has EVERYTHING you can think of. I love going to the quotes pages, crossword puzzles and random stuff like that.
   --> Live fireworks - you get to make your own fireworks display
   --> the Puzzle or crossword puzzle
   --> great quotes (for those of you who like a quote of the day kinda thing)
   --> but my favorite and my sisters favorite is the unanswered questions ( you may have seen a few of these on my profile: ie. Why don't hairs on your amrs get split ends? In that song, ""she'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes"" who is ""she""? etc...

* i encourage looking at this site if you are at all bored :)

in tradition of live journal... or at least with Sam and I - I must make a small shout out to Ball in the house :) I met them this past weekend and they are all extremely talented musicians. They are an acappella group who Sam has known for a few years. They are great guys and I was so pleased to have met them :) so I encourage you to visit www.ballinthehouse.com and find out when they're playing at a concert hall near you so you can become more cultured ;) 

Finally - I'm all about Bugs Bunny and looney tunes, cartoons, etc (disney is a great company as well! :)). So here is a sight for your listening pleasure of all sorts of looney tunes clips :)
--->  http://www.barbneal.com/looney.asp

Ok so that's enough for today - I gotz to get some sleep :) I hope this isn't overly boring - if it is let me know, I'll find some way to spruce it up! :)"

"event","Hello! This is the first time i've tried one of these things. It's kinda neat. Now I can let you know how I'm doin, what's been going on in the life of me :)

I suppose the first thing I have to say is a BIG thank you to Sam and Kathy for taking me to the Ball in the House concert yesterday. It was such a great time, regardless of the fact that i fell asleep twice on the way home! (i'm not a night person...) :)

More to come later - :)"

"event","Well, I'm in Chicago for the few weeks and I could not to happier to be home.  Do not get me wron I love livig in Las Vegas but it is always good to come home for a visit every now and then.  My plans while I am in Chicago are very big hopefully catch some Sox games as they are 15-4 the best start ever.  Let me say I have watched a ton of games this year and they are a great team to watch, being a Sox fan is tough espically since Cubs fans outnumber us and if the Cubs were 15-4 I do believe that there fans heads would explode.  Also, the Bulls are playing great and I managed to get 3 tickets to Wed. playoff game, which I am looking forward to mighlty.  ALl and all not much to say good to be back if even only for 2 weeks."

Read The Rape Of Nanking by Iris Chang it a disturbing and powerfull book hard to get threw in some parts but read it.  This part of history has been hidden and forgetten for too long now, shit there is a whole country of people who won't even admit it ever even happened."

"event","Just got up a few mins. ago at 7:15 which since like Jan. is the earliest that I have been up.  I have ben having some dental issues of late like 2 that is right two damn roots canals.  Now being that it is early and I'm not a morning person I am going to vent a little and just give you all a few who read this journal some things I dislike.  I was going to use hate but hate is a word I don't use now.  SO here we go!

                          MATT'S DISLIKES

 1. The Religious Right.    Why I dislike them is easy since for the last 2 months I have not gotten but let me say found a religion that I believe in and I'm no longer a Catholic(sorry mom)  I have realized that they are destroying this country with there you don't know how to raise your kids so we will for you shit, and are trying there hardest to piss on are freedoms, like say the like freedom of speech.  By the way for all you pro-choice people like myself if they have there way abortion will be outlawed again because the pro-life movement who I will group in with the religious right have are George W's ear.

 2. Chicago Cubs  I especially dislike some of there fans like my twin brother Mark(just kidding) who for some reason is the only one in my family who likes the losers, I'm telling you its funny how if say there player has elbow issues Dusty will say he just has a cold and will be back next week then that player comes back 2 months later. they always treat there fans like dumb asses scalp there own tickets and some how manage to get away with it all.  I swear Cubs players could sell crack to pregnant women and kids and there fans would still love them.  Amber I shall wait a retort!

 Now for a lot of little shit I dislike people and places, things and ideas.

1.The Bush Family
2.Ex-Girlfriends
3.Lindsay Lohan
4.Pairs Hilton
5.Cats
6.People who say history is boring!
7.Green Day (sorry derek)
8.Snowboarders
9.New York City
10.Most Religion's
11.Idea of Marriage
12.Green Bay Packers
13.Wisconsin
14.Girls who watch sports because there is a guy they think is hot.
15.Guys who either don't hold or open the door for women
16.Men who leave there kids (should be shot)
17.People who touch me when they know that I have this thing about it but then they think it is funny to go ahead and touch me anyways.
18.Last I hate using spell check on this damn journal!"

"event","So I am back in Las Vegas and I could not have gotten back soon enough.  For the people I never got to hook up with in Chicagoland my regrets but I had so many people too see it was just impossible to see everyone, on top of that I was able to blew off a poker tournment on Sunday and get an earlier flight with Southwest to get home Sunday night so I could see my cousin who plays b-ball for The Univ. of New Mexico play UNLV at the Thomas&Mack Center here in Vegas.  Seriously being out here now and not dealing with the weather is kickass I mean no drops of the temp. from like 50 to 15 in a day, it never aeven gets below 0 that often to begin with.  SO, moving on I got into a discussion with my friend Nora over how she thinks there aren't any good tv shows anymore, my response to that was there are plenty on but the crap outweighs the quality if you know what I mean, so I will post my Top 5 TV shows.

5.  Alias  For a show I only started watching 3 weeks ago and Im only up to the 3rd season.  I'd like to think Amber for putting me on to it, though I really don't think this show will last many more years wit Jennifer Garner making more flicks and such.

4.  The Shield  THis is by far the best COp show on TV Vic Makey kicks ass that all I have to say.

3.  Arrested Devolpment  Not just a good sitcom but the best sitcom since Jerry,George,Elaine, and Kramer graced the airwaves.  It just might be the only watchable sitcom on TV.

2. Without A Trace  In a TV world with all of those CSI's which I don't watch this show is very good that takes a little of what CSI does with the whole flashback thing but does it much better.

1.  24  Is in anyone who know me since the day this was put on TV I've loved it.  IT is non-stop action that keeps you guessing every week and you just never kno if this is the year were Jack Bauer finally gets killed.  Best show on TV.

Now please leave your comments on my top 5 and leave yours."

"event","Ok, last night at say 3 am or so I'm walking out of the Rio after about a 8 hour session of poker.  I'm just about to the valet when I here someone calling my name I turn and no one so I'm thinking it's the lack of slep,then I here my name again and what the fuck it's Sam a girl I'm sure Derek,Amber and Caleb who read this know very well.  It seems like everyone else who I run into didn't think it was me because I'm no longer George Costaza like looking.  It's just weird I have know run into 2 people 1 in LA and 1 in Vegas I just find it weird that BLockbuster keeps following me around like a stalker.  So anywa Sam was there with some of her friends for her b-day or whatever and was a little drunk and I ended up going out for a late lunch today to Kona Cafe which is a great Japanese steak house.  SO anyway I just think its weird how I have not worked for BLockbuster for close too 2 years but the people I know from there seem to be all over the place."

"event","Ok, so it has been a couple of weeks since my last update so I thought I would let everyone know what has been going on of late.  First off someone hacked into my computer and caused me a bunch of problems.  I could not get online for 3 days and had to have The Geek Squad from Best Buy come out and fix the whole damn thing.  Second, I had to drive out to LA because my mom is getting married next month and she had this idea that I needed to bond with Jim her future husband.  It isn't that I don't like the guy it is just that it is weird seeing my mom with anyone other then my dad.  My sister says I should get over it, it has been 3 years since he died but hey what can I say I think alot of people would find it weird.  So in LA I get to hang out with some old frat buddies from Arizona State who have seen not to have grown up since are frat days but hey it was fun watching them drink, for all of you who do not know if I drink which I was never a big drinker to begin with I will end up with mirganes that cause me to have blindness, vomiting, and basically be bedridden for a week so you can see why I no longer drink.  We ended up at Commerence Casino in LA which was fun my first live action poker playing since my January break, I did well not great but still ending up leaving up which is more then I can say for my friends.  

  Moving on I have seen all the nominated movies for best picture for the Oscar.  Right now I would say for Million Dollar Baby is slightly ahead of Ray and Sideways.  The Aviator was kind of boring and while I enjoyed Finding Neverland I would not put it up there with Million Dollar Baby and Sideways.  The Oscar's will be alot mor fun now that I dont have to deal with The Lord of the Rings anymore thank god there done.  Now if Jamie Foxx dosen't win in mind it will be a misjustice he plays Ray Charles so well.  Now, for all you people who think Passion got jipped I  will say that its not even a good movie now I'm I will here all those people who say how could it not get nomnated it made so much money well The Grudge made alot of money and that was a pile of crap, I'm sure Caleb well like that last line.  Well, that is it for now for all my Chicago friends I will be gracing you with my presence March 3-10 so you all have something to look forward too."

"event","Ok since I have decided not to sub the rest of the year at all me, my could be or could not be girlfriend Heather, her brother Mike and this really dumb chick from LA Nora went to Park City, Utah.  Now, you may ask what is Park City well first of all you can ski alot, but we didn't do that.  The city is really small like around 10,00 people or so.  Now if you know me you know I prefer the indie type of movies or if you want to use the term art house film you can but I won't.  Sundance with the exception of being overcrowded was so much fun.  The hotel we stayed in was actually a log cabin which was really cool I loved the french toast they had I will dream about it for years to come.  If you go to Sundance be prepared to pay 15 to 30 dollars for some movies, and thats not even on the last day when showing range up to the 100's for all the awards and such but we were just there for the first 2 days and I think Sundance lasts until like Friday.  Now, I saw 6 films in those 2 days and enjoyed 5 hated one.  The first film that Heather and I saw Mike and Nora refused on basis of Pierce Brosnan's involvement with the Bond films which i fully understand, but hey I was keeping a openmind.  Pierce Brosnan plays a hit-man in The Matador, the was peer enjoyment, when I was reading up on it on IMBD.Con before we left for it the best line was Pierce Brosnan plays James Bond's evil twin brother.  Now the movie isn't a Bond film at all being that its actually a good movie not just a bunch of shit throwen together for people who like to see shit blowen up and pointless gadgets.  I would say that its Pierce Brosnan's best work and I was really shocked on how much that I enjoyed it.  The movie aslo has a great cast with Hope Davis and Philip Baker Hall.  Another film we saw that we hated was Thumbsucker a movie about a 17yo kid who still sucks his thumb, in other words a movie based on the life of you derek.   Seriously though this a one of those film that just cries out were an indie film loves us watch us.  Vince Vaughn has a small part in this for some reason,  I'm going to look past this Vince only if you will.  The movie is just lame from start to finish and rambles on like I do mabe even worse and has Keanu Reeves for some reason playing a shrink.  Well thats all for now if anyone ever has a chance to go to Sundance I would highly recommend it."

"event","So I'm bored so I'm going to make a list here.

5.  Matt Damon  I'd say that almost all of his movies I enjoy espically the Bourne movies.  I really don't live action movies so it say alot about how much I love those movies.  He can do all generes he was the only good thing about Ocean's 12.  Id say the only movie I did not like is The Talented Mr. Ripley.  I would have to say the Rounders does hold a special place in my heart though.  

4. Don Cheadle  Now like most people say when I tell him he's one of my favorite acters the say who?  Well, that is a shame this man  is one of the best acters out there toady espically of late with movies like Hotel Rwanda which if you haven't see you must see, aslo the The United States of Leland in which is role isn't that big but very dramtic and very good, just realsed The Assassination of Richard Nixon with Sean Penn now if you can hang with him in any movie you got skills.  Id say Hotel Rwanda and his supporting role in Traffic are my favs.

3. Will Ferrell  What can I say but the man is comic genius from his work in SNL to movies like Office Space,Elf, and Ancherman.  In Elf I think he is the one acter that could have pulled that role off and do two things make it funny and not alieanate his loyal fans.  Ancherman what can I say in my book is already a classic.  He has a movie called Kicking&Screaming coming out in May and I just downloaded the trailer and laughed my ass he's a soccer coach of his 10 yo kids team and its him just doing his ususal over the top thng it looks funny.

2. Tom Hanks  The man had just made great movie after great movie I mean I don't really have to say much just with movies like The Terminal, Saving Private Ryan, Green Mile, the underated Road to Perdition, making Cast Away with basically just him and a volleyball for 2 hours awesome,YOu've Got Mail which I dont car if its a chick flick it kicks ass.  NOw my favorit film of his is Phildelphia were he plays a lawyer with AIDS his role is in that film is one of the all time bests in my opinon.  The only film I really dont like is Ladykillers

1.  Eward Norton  It was a tough choice between him and Hanks but for some reason I'm going with him for my number one.  Me unlike alot of guys who like him his work is moe then just FIght Club for me, though it is a good role its not my favorite one of his.  American History X is a classic film his role as a skinhand who gets sent to prison and eventually sees the light of day is just great, his character and so much depth to that something that I have not seen in alot of actors of all of late.  Primal Fear is anoher role im talking about I mean it was has 1st movie and I way just blowen away when I first saw it.  He has made choices for films that not alot of actors would have made from playing the fucked up Worm in rounders to the 25th Hour about a man spending his last day before going to jail.  I mean I haven't even mentioned The People vs. Larry Flynt or The Score or even Red Dragon which I enjoyed.  Of late he hasn't made anything since the The Italian Job 2 years ago so Im looking forward to whatever comes out of his work next.

Honarable Mention:  Ben Stiller,VIce Vaughn,Chris Cooper, and Kiefer Sutherland.

The five worst that don't even desvere a comment
5. Brad Pitt
4. Ashton Kutcher 
3. Keanu Reeves 
2. John Travolta
1. The devil himself Freddie Prinze Jr. 

Now please for the handfull pf people who waste there time reading my journal pleas comment with ur likes and dislikes of this list or ur favs or least favs!"

Well since I really haven't been doing that much lately with exception of getting ready for the Las Vegas marathon with my Team in Training friends.  Seriously Im doing much better then before with this being my 2nd marathon I am thinking of going for 3 hours 59mins mark thats not too lofty of a goal my 1st marathon was 4 hours 22mins so I going for under 4 hours this time.  I'm actually looking forward to starting my training for the Chicago trialthon in August it will be my first one so I am looking forward to it."

"event","Well, another lovely night here in Vegas.  Not much to go over today watched some football with my friend Mike and Heather who is the only girl I have ever knowen to know more about football then me.  After the came went to shhot some pool and promtly lost 200 to Mike that is what I get for wagering on something that I'm not very good at anymore.  Other then that on Saturday had the Hold'em tourney at the Belliago did not manage to cash I was busted out pretty early so that give me time to play 7-Stud 5-10 for about 6 hours.  I don't usually play it that long but I did well and managed to get about 300 in the black for the night which isn't bad because 7 card stud is probably my worst game.  Other then that now Im off to watch some Tivo the first show being the first 2 hours of my favorite show 24 then msybe some crossing jorden so who knows."

"event","So this is my 1st chance I have gotten to update my journal in a while so I thought I would let everyone know what I was up too.  So from what I hear I left Chicago right before some major snowfall which is good.  So I started subbing for the Las Vegas Public school system and I will tell you right now this is the only semester I will ever do it again.  Moving on I hopefully will close on my cool townhome with a week when I do I'll post some pics on here it it so awesome I can't begin to explain it.  Big weekend ahead on Saturday I will be playing a the weekly $1000 buy-in hold'em tournment and hopefully if I finish in the money I will be doing what 5 of my fellow card playing friends have been doing and giving 50% to the American Red Cross, I figure that's the least I can do I have already given some money but feel like there is something more I could do, but then again I'm sure everyone feels that way too.  To brighter things I might have a new favorite movie in Garden State I have already watched it at least 5 times and gone threw the whole dvd and still want to watch it again, I mean Natlie Portman is just great I always thought she other thn the Star Wars crap just kinda played off the whole look at me I'm so cute thing but now with Garden State and Closer too great movies she has really beacome a great acter espically in Garden State I could not take my eyes off her.  Well that's all for now more to come later."

"event","Well had another long day here in Illinois.  I had been looking forward to this day since I got back into town from Vegas.  Woke up at around 8 about two hours before I would have liked but oh well since I had some time went to the gym did some cardio which really woke my of late, lazy ass up.  So after that headed out with my buddy Mike to wonderfull Gary Ind. for a poker tournament at Trump Casino.  Now for those of you who don't know my style of card playing I will tell you.  To begin with, this was a smaller tournament, 500 buy-in No-Limit Texas hold'em with no re-buy(which i hate them anyways). The field was small 60 people and no big money pros which is because why would they be in gary, anyway the only reason is that I need to play so I won't get rusty.  So to gett o the point I did play well not my best, did double up after 5 hands when i raised 700 when I was in the big blind and the small blind re-rasied me the rest of his tack I called him quickly due to the fact they I had pocket aces he showed ace queen off suit so I had 8000 in chips right away.  I ended up finishing 5th to win 3100 after taxes, which I was happy but I still think I should of won but then again I always think that.  SO, with it being over was going to stay and play some 100-200 limit holde'em but it was 5 and I had heard that the weather was getting bad so we called it day.  We got home around 8 yes two hours from the casino to my friend's place in frankfort were I have been staying traffic was shitty I hate snow and will not miss it.  So after that some people came over we watche I Robot which I ws against but ended up liking so much that I just bought it on amazon.  Then we played some spade for a while and that brings us to now as I sit on my laptop typing this with about 6 people in the room one of which who keeps telling if I remember that time when I got my boot stuck in the step stool at blockbuster when we worked in oak forest. Well that it for more to come when I feel like it!"

My retort is this SHUT THE FUCK UP!  U bastards never I mean never accepted the fact that Clinton was the president I mean come on how was naming Kenneth Star impartial, I hear this a lot from Rush you know the fat man who likes to get pills from his housekeeper, this is the same man who said for 8 years that America was held hostage by the Clinton presidency so one last thing to my brother whom I love dearly SHUT THE FUCK UP!"

"event","Ok so as many of you know I cont. to hate George W. with all the passion I did before a won another 4 terms.  Now, just to give you some insight into the man, who if not for Karl Rove and would not be president.  First off for all of my male friends under 30 do you honestly think there will not be draft or at least some sort of  mandatory military service in the next 4 years.  Now you may be saying that matt George W. already said he will not bring back the draft, if you think that let me throw some numbers your way.  First half 2009, yep 2009 is when we are excepted to pull out of Iraq, now what does that mean, that means our troops who are already over extended will be forced back from retirement our forced to stay in combat longer and longer.  The second being the recruitment is at a 25 year low I mean with 18yo's seeing hat happens why would they want to sign up for the reserves to pay for school when they will most likely be called up and may never have the chance to actually go to school.  Well that's all for now more statements to come."

"event","Well, another lazy day for me today.  Did not do much saw 2 movies today one so-so and the other one good. The first one being Ocean's Twelve a movie in which I have been dying to see since Oceans Eleven is in my Top Ten and all.  Suffice to say I was kinda disappointed in the movie, now I do not know if this was do to me being up for too much or just that it did not compare to the first one in many ways.  First off I am not a real big Steven Soderbergh fan he directed Ocean's Eleven and Traffic but other then that the rest is a bunch of crap.  The other probelm is he seems to want this film to look like an indie film for some reason now I love alot of indie films but why try and make Oceans 12 an indie film I didn't come to see an indie I came too see a  funny/heist movie with witty banter, which there is alot of but why make it look like an indie film.  The story isn't as good as the first one either but that is to be excepted, and also I like the Andy Garcia character but why make him look like a gay man out for revenage.  I aslo could of use more of the Scott Caan and Casey Afflect characters there always funny, as for the Zeta-Jones character I just did not get her at all.  The best part or at least the best cameo went to the always funny Topher Grace is was hilarious if you ask me.  THe other film was Closer not as much too say but that it just was a good movie a type of movie that they don't make anymore, and Natalie Portman as my friend Amy pointed hot is damn sexy and you know when a girl points that out it must be true.  Well thats all for this updated be back soon."

"event","Well, hello all at least hello too the handful or so whom will read this damn thing anyway.  Let's start off by saying that I no longer live in this state for all of you who do not know that to begin way, yes I have moved to sin city Las Vegas.  Now to you who do not know this will be shocking but to those few not so much, my love for Vegas has always been deep so when I went and saw my friend mike the last week of August well, I just never left.  Now you my think this is weird , however I do not for some reason I was in a rut in chicago I liked teaching but did not really love it, and there were some people especially one, I really needed to get away from mainly for the reason if I did not those people might have been killed or more likely the case kill me.  Well now that I mentioned the depressing stuff I don't want this to sound like ratboy's (derek)journal so I will move on.  So there were two main reasons for the most part I stayed, one my friend's sister heather whom I always liked and vice versa but all the years I have know her either I was involved with someone or she was so it never worked out until I went for a visit and basically for the 2nd and hopefully last time fell in love with a girl, and a girl by the way who does not have baggage like the last one.  As for the 2nd reason well that is my love of poker, poker of all kinds hold'em, 7-stud, omaha, and all the different types of them.  Now you may ask has Matt lost his mind and believe me a lot of people have, but I had all this money my dad left me and I was sick of people telling me to do this to do that with that I decided to try and filfull my really one dream I have had for the last 6 years and try and i repeat to try play poker full time.  I can report so far even though I am hard on myself the results of been good.  I mostly pay in tournaments and mostly hold'em or 7-stud hi-lo which might be my best game, I have cashed in 6 tournaments  out of 12 50% which is pretty good since the usually % is closer to 30% of your tournaments you will cash in.  So you my ask this really is not a job or a career but to me it can be I keep track of my winnings and my loses and I work it it everyday I usually when not playing in a tournament will be playing int he cash games in the casino up to 12 hours a day 7 days a week to improve my game.  My first tournaments winnings have so far covered all my loses to fold i won a 1000 buy in holdem event at belliago and took home after taxes about 45,000 which actually for that particular casino was a small amount but I will take it.  So just so whoever reads this and is not aware I will be in chicago until the 28th or so seeing friends and family and taking care of some things I still have the same cell phone number until the end of this month then it will be a vegas number too which i will e-mail u all.  SO I will update this as much as possible now that I have a life and some things to say buy the way it will mostly revolve around my life and vegas,sports,movie reviews, and politics so I hope too see you all before I leave bye for now."

"event","So, have not had that much time of late to update this thing so I thought since I had a few I would try to write something interesting, but hey I am not that interesting.  Have had a good couple weeks in a row now with school a weeks away from being over and baseball season coming to an end, will actually have some time to catch some Whitesox games which should be good, they broke out of there hitting slump today with a 15-0 win which I always enjoy. Thats it for now I will try to update more often but who knows."

"event","Ok, Caleb you not being a baseball fan there is something you need to know about Cubs fans.  First, most of these so called cub fans go to Wrigley not for the game but for the Wrigley experience now I'm not saying all Cubs fans do it but I know someone who has season tickets but isn= not even a baseball fan just goes there to party at the bars, I guarantee to you that if the south side had the bars and such the sox would draw better.  Next, I would never throw trash on a my home teams field cubs fans have been doing it for years even when they win say on a walk off home run what do they do to celebrate litter the field with debris thats what they do.  Now, I'm sure someone will say well sox fans run onto the field and attack people, well the second guy who ran onto to the field was not a cubs fan and was at a cubs game that afternoon and was already drunk when he probably got to the sox game.  Now both times disgusted me and embarrassed me as a sox fan I'll admit, but it should be now more embrassing that when cubs fans picked a fight with the dodgers bullpen in 1998.  Now you ask this is just a sox fan jealous well your wrong there I don't give two shits about the cubs except when they play the sox, yes I hate them but I have a team on the south side thats fun to watch and don't worry myself with cubs fans."

"event","Well, after Friday my journal reading friends, I will be officially a 50 50 partner in a Subway franchise.  Yes that's right a Subway franchise you might ask yourself why would he do that, well it is because Subway well they make as much money as a Burger King but with half the overhead.  Another reason is is that I will be what you call a silent partner which means I will have barley anything to do with the store which is nice cause basically I know shit about running a food operation the only reason why I'm doing is is too make my money twice over then sell out to my buddy Mike who is a great businessman.  So now when you people want Subway starting in June I want you to go to Burr Ridge I give me your money by buying lots of subs, and another thing do I look like that Jared guy let me know."

"event","Not to much to say tonight, so I thought I would give a little movie review. The Punisher I would have to say, that it is the best action movie I quite simply have ever seen.  Now, if you know me you know I do not like action movies, I instead prefer movies were people have to act and have story and plot lines two things action movies do not usually have.  So, The Puinsher I for some reason since seeing the trailers really wanted to see it, and I would have to say that Thomas Jane who usually takes drama roles brings brings a depth to his character that I have never seen in a action film before, the supporting roles,the villain played by John Travolta is not over the top at all, a shocker since every other role he does he seems to over act.  n closing I would recommend seeing this over Kill BIll Vol. 2 since, I personally hated the first one.  Thats all for now later folks."

"event","Yes, yes I finally got all my tickets and everything else for our big trip to europe for the last week of june and the month of july i'm so happy if that cubs winning does not bring me down.  On another note of late I have have been listening to alot of rap don't really know why since i hate the so called gangsta rap like 50 cent and jay-z but i have to say that rappers like common, outkast and yes q-tip seem to be very intriguing to me.  And as I leave you I ask you this is The Daily Show and Jon Stewart not one if not the best half hours on tv out there right now."

"event","Well since I was bored and Derek told me to do one of these fancy journal things I thought why the fuck not got nothing better to do and nobody I know would read so I can just ramble on and on for hours so here we go.  First I want to address derek's roommates whom I know will read this since derek will tell them to. It would be in your best interests not to go with Derek to the Ben concert May 1st or as I told Derek I have some friends in a little group called the russian mob who owe me a favor so just think about it before going or someone who speaks bad english might come knocking at your door very soon.  Moving on I thought I would comment on are non-elected president's speech tonight I mean how is this man the world's leader I would not let him lead a boy scout troop I mean this man is so stupid, 1st lets blame 9/11 on Clinton admin. well because its easy too, then lets go to war with Iraq well because I'm from Texas and they have oil and I want it.  On a lighter side the Sox won today blew out KC 12-5 and boy cub fans Maddox looked great in the opener.  Well I'm getting tired now so I'm off to bed and my girlfriend or fiancee whatever she is now calling herself is bitching at me to get off so as I'm a little bitch I'll run upstairs.  Bye-Bye"

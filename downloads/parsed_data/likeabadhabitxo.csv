<P>yesterday was sweet. adrienne and cassie came over around 245, kev n taylor came over around 315 and we all left around 4ish?&nbsp;me and the boys&nbsp;got stuck with the backseat and i got stuck with the middle seat (gr) yeah so it was&nbsp;a long squished drive there, i forgot goggles and kev forgot his neckwarmer... so we were gonna go in the lodge and swipe some but ended up meeting up with andy&nbsp;who had extra&nbsp;stuff. we went to the bk lounge and avoided this kid :-\ ehhhhh creepy. after a while taylor wanted to try snowboarding so kev took his skis and they switched... sooooo funny. i got some good pics of them falling all over the bunny hill and into fences.&nbsp;hahaa i couldnt stop laughing. after that we went down this real curvy run that was closed cuz there were no lights. it was awesome cuz you couldnt see anything. taylors ski got messed up and they couldnt get the boot off the ski, so i pulled it around by the leash... looked kinda funny. we were pretty tired after that so we went into the coffee shop and sat there making fun of people as always. left there around 10 and fell asleep in a ball (for real this time) on the ride home. so&nbsp;it was a pretty funny night.. only one more day of ski club :(</P>"

"event","<P>last night. was amazing. around 3 me n jor went to grace's, made popcorn and watched donnie darko. got to the icon around 6 when the doors were supposed to open, waited in the car til the line started to move... doors didnt open til way later and by the time a thorn for every heart finally started playin it was 715ish. we found a good spot on the side of the stage where we could all see from. hellogoodbye was awesome. soooo cute. grace got tons of pics of them, ill post as soon as she send them to me. punchline was alrite. im getting sick of them, iv seen them like 4 times already damnit, theyre everywhere. thennnnn for my favoriteeeeeee. HIDDEN IN PLAIN VIEW. they were soooooo good. while we were still standing by the stage this kid came up and stood by the wall next to me. so im like 'jor check this kid out' and she told grace. and i guess she knew him or something? haha. so us sneaky kids took a pic of 'me' to get him in the background. (like 3 times) after the 2nd time he totally knew what we were doing and turned around and smiled for it haha. and when we went to go sit down we shared a seat? yep... we're cool. katelyn was off talking to one of the guys in the band and got his number. he was 27, shes 17. niiiiiiiiice haha. he was cute tho. while we we leaving rob from hipv signed a poster for me and i got a pic with him. he looks gay haha. i bought a tshirt, track jacket and cd... got some free posters too.</P>
<P>so the whole night i was lookin for al... couldnt find him :(... when we were walking out i felt someone grab my side and he was there. i cant believe we were there the whole night and didnt see each other. fucking sucks.</P>
<P>but overall this was the best concert iv been to in a looong time. so amazing. hipv played 20 below last and all the other bands went on stage and stuff, kids were goin nuts crowd surfing and throwing water bottles around..&nbsp; it was just like 'wow this is awesome' i cant even explain it.... sooooooo good!!! &lt;333</P>"

'i never gain weight. my bones must be made out of... crackers or something.' CRACKER BONES, MY DAWG. haha... after bk, we ran back to the lodge and sat in the 'cozy' coffe shop and made fun of so many people. this scummy guy came in and was hittin on me n mal and asked me for a swedish fish and kept calling us 'miss' so we both stared at him when he left and mal was like 'DANG IT' and he musta thought we were upset he was leaving or something cuz he smiles reeeaaallll big and came back a few times. we got bored in the coffee shop and decided to take the elevator up and down and stop at the kitchen and when the doors open, point and laugh at the people and just go back down. too funny.

"event","My biggest fear is drowning. I am deathly afraid of deep water or and water deeper than my bath tub. Lately I have gotten into pools and gone to the beach. At the beach I'll only go in until I'm waist deep because the current scares the crap out of me. At the pool I'll go a little deeper. I punched my friend in the face because she tried to dunk me. NEVER EVER try that. When people splash in the water I get so upset. ugh just thinking about it makes me cringe."

The most memorable concert I've ever been to was a Gym Class Heroes concert last October. Estelle was the opener and The Roots and GCH were the headliners. It was the first time I ever almost got into a fight. In Baltimore theres this whole rule about not smoking inside public spaces. This one douche-bag decided to light up a joint right in front of these two kids  and just blew smoke right in their faces. One of the boys had locks and was worrying that he might get in trouble because the the smell might stick. (sad right. he just washed his hair too. Anyway he kept smoking and he was more than a little drunk. he was being loud and obnoxious so we tried to push him away since the crowd was moving. big mistake. douche-bag decides he was going to punch one of these ""black bitches"" but he didn't know which one of us it was. He started a big commotion and the band actually stopped, got him removed and Travis (lead singer/rapper dude) gave the deadlock kid his towel. I'll never forget that, it was a rough night. I had to take my SAT the morning after too."

Hmm I'd probably give my mom half just cause thats my mommy and she deserves it. I'd give my aunt 250k to fix up her house, It's where I grew up and is in desperate need of a makeover. The rest would go to various charities in the city."

There will be no more midnight release parties,no more Hogwarts,and most importantly no more Harry.After buying the book I tried to procrastinate so as not to let the story end.It only took me 2 hours to give in.I started reading on Saturday and finshed at 1 am Monday morning.After I was done i calmly stood on my porch and yelled.

    In short I was angry that so many people died.Well no,they were in the middle of a war at the time so I expected deaths but the way the deaths were presented.Hedwig, Mad-Eye, Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Snape, they're all dead.I was satisfied in"

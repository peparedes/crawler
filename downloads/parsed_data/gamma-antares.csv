<CENTER>===^v^v^===</CENTER>
When Bumblebee and Spike returned to the Ark, the near emptiness of the base was a stark contrast to what they left. Instead of bustling activity, they only found Tracks, Cliffjumper, Ratchet, and the recently returned to base Inferno and Red Alert. Their attention was on whatever was on Teletraan's main screen. 
By their individual reactions, it wasn't from a soap opera.
""Impossible!""
""Only in this planet's myth and legend do they get that big!""
""It wasn't a malfunction after all, but sabotage!""
""Primus! We'll have to make upgrades to the security system, if something like that got in. Oh great, oh slagging great!""
""Relax Red! Who'd knew *that* would get in, at least it wasn't a Decepticon!""
""Still Inferno, what if one of the Decepticons find a simular way? What if it was Skywarp?!""
""Skywarp isn't even smart enough to mess with those controls.""
After letting Spike out of his passenger compartment to transform out of alt mode, Bumblebee was the first to get the attention of somebody of those assembled. ""So, whats so interesting guys: 'As the Kitchen Sinks' on?"" He joked.
Ratchet looked away from Teletraan's screen to address the recent arrival, urgent to get an answer that the mini-bot might have. ""Nothing as mundane but amusing as that, Bumblebee. Do you remember that brown Autobot that was brought in before you left on patrol?""
""The shot-up one? The one who ""got the drop"" on Wheeljack outside soon after?""
""Yes, the same. Did you see anything out of the ordinary while waiting for Spike in my Med bay?""
""Nothing, just as things usually are around here. That is until Gamma... is that his name?""
""Yes it is 'Bee, continue.""
""Until Gamma came out of that automated repair thing you and 'Jack made. Didn't look the same like as he went in.""
""Then I'd think you better see this. Spike, you might want to watch as well, to get a human perspective.""
As Spike Witwicky and his Cybertronian buddy joined closer to those who stayed behind in the Ark, Ratchet continued. 
""It has been discovered that there wasn't a malfunction as first feared in why Gamma Antares managed to look like a Cabrabot now...""
""A 'Cabrabot' Ratchet?"" A puzzled Bumblebee asked.
""A term those of us here came up with while the both of you were out on patrol. Not even Prime and the others know about this yet.""
Spike was curious as to why the base had relatively sparce personnel at the Ark upon his and 'Bee's return. ""Where are they now, guys?""
""En route to someplace in Southern California called 'Calico'. It was found out that the Decepticons are using that tourist destination in the desert as a Space Bridge location. Prime is letting Gamma return to Cybertron to retrieve some valuable data contained in an axe Gamma left behind.""
The last part about 'data in an axe' left Spike a bit confused until Tracks jumped in to explain. ""Spike, you've been with us long enough to know that not everything is at it seems at first."" Spike looked around at those who were in the main control room with him, and remembered that yes, his mechanical buddies worked at a much different paradigm than he was used to: on Earth an axe was just an axe to chop a tree down, not something that can also be used to store Grandma Vivian's chocolate chip cookie recipe as well. It wasn't that he took his Cybertronian buddies for granted, maybe he did to a point, but there is much more he doesn't know about the technologies about his friends that he would need more lifetimes to learn about.

Tracks continued, ""Gamma claims that his interface contains sensitive data about where he was staying at, a planet called ""K'Veht"" if I remember correctly, that he doesn't want in Decepticon hands. He, Jazz, and Wheeljack are returning to Cybertron to recover it."" When the Autobot scout and his human friend came within view of Teletraan's mainscreen, Tracks then started with his demonstration.

""As one can see in this raw security stream, Gamma is seen being brought into the automated repair construct by Ratchet and Ironhide. After setting up the chamber Gamma was in, Ratchet then left to attend to Mirage's maintenence while automated repair took care of our recent arrival. Things appeared to go well during the entire process for the time it took for the repairs to be made, but when Gamma was finished and emerged from the chamber, obviously for those who've known him for a while, noticed right off that the same Gamma Antares wasn't the same afterwards: something went wrong in repairs that somehow didn't alert Ratchet's attention.""
""That's right,"" The Autobot CMO chimed in. ""I suspected that nothing went wrong until Gamm was done, but I couldn't stop him in time from reporting to Optimus, as the repair apparatus somehow signaled Prime that Gamma was ready for duty."" Turning to Bumblebee, the CMO asked the scout for his side of the story. ""Did you see anything unusual, 'Bee?""
""Not a thing, Ratchet. Just as you said: Nothing strange... until Gamma came out that is.""
""Hmm..."" Thoughtful, Tracks then went into the next part. ""When I went through the entire feed, at first I saw nothing was wrong, until I did a close-up analysis of the chamber's controls."" Starting the playback of the close-up footage, Tracks was careful to point out a detail to everyone assembled. ""As one can see from the angle the sensors were able to supply, the controls of the chamber started to self-motivate themselves, and from Ratchet's testimony, something that they were not designed to do!"" Ratchet nodded in agreement as Tracks continued with with his findings. ""After extensive filtering with the help of Red Alert, we found that a cloaking technology of an advanced level, even by Cybertronian standards, were used to hide who or what was behind Gamma's new face plate and helm features.""
""More like who..."" Red Alert interrupted, only to be quieted down by Inferno.

Letting the slight interruption go, Tracks continued. He switched Tele-traan's main viewer to the security footage he needed to show. ""After going through the known spectra that energy could be picked-up from the security system and finding nothing, Red Alert suggested sweeping through all possible and theoretical spectra to find that our mysterious guest was using a phased patchwork of energies to mask his presence. Almost like he is existing on more than one dimensional plane at the same time.""
""Will Wheeljack get a copy of this with your theory?"" Ratchet inquired.
""This kind of thing is exactly his department!"" Tracks nodded. ""This will keep him busy just thinking about the possibilities for vorns."" Redirecting attention to the screen, he continued with his findings. ""Anyway as one can see, after Gamma was placed in the chamber and Ratchet activated the mechanism, the CMO left to attend to other duties. Mili-kliks later another entitiy appeared, roughly the stature of Red here...""
""Why are you picking me out?!"" The ever-paranoid Red Alert blurted out.
""Stick it in neutral, will ya?"" Ordered a slightly irritated Ratchet. ""He's only picking you out for size reference!""
""Oh."" 
Giving a bit of sly optic to the head of security, Tracks continued on. ""...And then appeared to extend some kind of data coupling from inside his dark, hooded cloak and plugged it into the console. Subject then started doing what originally gave his presence away: manipulating the controls of the repair chamber."" This gave way to sounds of various ""Huhs"" and contemplative sounds from those assembled in the main control room.

""Then, checking to see if anybody was watching,"" Tracks not missing a beat, ""then briefly turned to reveal what he actually looked like."" Those who had not seen the footage before were aghast at the sight: they saw a humanoid face from within the hood looking towards Ratchet's repair bay to see if anybody noticed. Finding nobody knew of his presence, the figure gave a slight shrug and went back to what he was doing.

Puzzled, Bumblebee asked, ""What's with the data cable?""
""Records that we did get showed that some of Gamma's files were backed-up,"" Ratchet not missing a beat in reply. He further analyzed what data from the automated repair chamber he could find while Tracks filtered the security footage. ""I found new specifications for Gamma were uploaded at the same time, overwriting some of his original specs as a result. I have no idea if anything else was overwritten at the time.""
""So his personality could have been modified without his knowing?"" Cliffjumper inquired.
""Perhaps.""
""I'll add him to my list... just in case!"" This caused a chorus of groans, guffaws, and at least an ""Oh man!"" from the others. Perturbed, Ratchet demanded Cliffjumper to not do it: putting the Prime's old friend was rather pushing it. If Optimus found out, the Prime would be livid to the point of wanting to know everybody else who was on it. And why!
""Just a precaution!""
""No!"" The Autobot CMO demanded.
""Alright Ratchet."" The minibot resigned. Without giving intention emotionally, Cliffjumper quietly added the Cabrabot to his mental list anyway.

<B>Chapter:</B> Shockwave's Bender (Little Silver Robots)
<B>Author:</B> <lj user=""jim_ghote"">
<B>Generation:</B> G1-ish/Futurama!verse (sometime before the four DVD-movies.)
<B>Characters:</B> Shockwave, Task'r(oc), Knightstick(oc)*, Starscream and Hook (briefly), Futurama cast
<B>Rating:</B> T
<B>Warning(s):</B> Drunk &amp; emo-ish Shockwave, Bender being himself.
<B>Summary:</B> Shockwave has an unexpected visitor during his down time.
<B>Disclaimer:</B> HasTak owns ""Transformers"", we all know who owns ""Futurama"": I'm just doing this little mash-up for the jollys, no money.
<B>A/N:</B> These plot bunnies have been taking up space for so long, but instead of putting them up for adoption on <lj comm=""tf_plotbunnies""> where they'd grow old and die unloved,<STRIKE>as all of the other ones I posted</STRIKE> I decided to write these myself. These pairings are of any!verse TF, and that of a robot (or computer) of SF past. All of these are very AU, so take as one will. 
* <FONT size=-2>I'm willing to put Knightstick up for adoption on <lj comm=""tfmech_exchange""> if someone thinks he deserves further development. Inquire within!</FONT>

<lj-cut text=""o/~ What do you do with a drunken robot... o/~"">
<CENTER>===^v^v^===</CENTER><P align=left>The little holographic mech was taunting the over-energized custodian of Decepticon rule of Cybertron. The more Shockwave tried to ignore the irritating pest, the more emboldened the image got into being a pain in the gear. Shockwave didn't want the fact known to his own minions that he regularly got slag-faced on mixing small amounts of Ultra grade energon that he hid from everybody else due to the difficulty of its acquisition, with his ration of High grade. He imbibed in private to deal with the mounting tension of taking care of Cybertron he faced with every rotation: with the continual raids of the Autobot Underground taking what little Cybertron received from Megatron, to the discipline problems within ranks, Shockwave faced a myriad of problems.
Now this. 

Shockwave heard of the legend of the humans of Earth who hallucinated something called ""little pink elephants"" when they over-energized, but he just filed it away under the heading of ""Why being organic is inferior"", and gave it no mind until the moment this glitchy pest all of a sudden appeared on his desk.

""Little fragging glitch!""
""Listen pal, just because I show up unannounced while you were tying one on doesn't mean you don't want to have a drinking buddy. I even brought my own!"" While he was saying that, Bender opened the compartment in his torso to retrieve a bottle of malt liquor to show the much larger robot that he wasn't lying. At least this time. ""So, what are you drinkin'? Looks like pink lemonade."" Bender then proceeded to drink 1/4 of the Olde Fortran 40 ounce. The oscilloscope display that indicated when the tiny mech spoke went offline long enough for him to open it to access his fueling port.
""It is definitely NOT pink lemonade, fool! It is energon."" Out of frustration, Shockwave retorted angrily. ""And nothing like that stuff you're drinking, looks like something squeezed out of a human's waste sub-system!""
""Its the finest of malt liquor, like you would know. Besides, what would you know about those pathetic meatbags?"" Bender harrumphed,""One of my best friends happens to be human!""
Raising his left arm, Shockwave became incredulous at such a statement. ""Friend of a human?! Must mean you're an Autobot, or at least a sympathizer!"" Shockwave aimed his weapon at the little target, and fired a bolt. The blast went through Bender harmlessly to blast a large chunk out of the Decepticon's desk.
""Slaggit!""
""Ha, didn't anybody tell you: you can't shoot a hologram?"" Bender then deployed a cigar, while storing the 3/4 that remained of the bottle of his beverage. After putting the cigar in his vocal display, Bender continued while lighting up, ""Are you guys manufactured stupid around here, or what?""
""How dare you insult my intelligence like that, glitch! I'm in charge of a whole planet of mechanized life forms...""
""Why didn't you tell me I'm making a visit to Robot Planet?"" Bender exclaimed enthusiastically I have some chums here, well o.k., maybe a few.""
""This is not ""Robot Planet""!"" If Shockwave could spit, the term of ""robot"" would have left his vocalizer with such venom at the term, he considered it that much of an insult. ""You are on the planet Cybertron, fool! I'm of a mechanized lifeforms millions of Earth years in existence...""
""Hey, I'm from Earth...""
""Impossible! Humans don't have the technology or intelligence to manufacture advanced mechanisms."" Shockwave reached for a button on the remains of his desk to call security. It flashed that it was working, but the large blue-violet mech wasn't entirely sure, since he had just blasted part of his desk away because of this little silver pest.
Bender retorted, ""Where and when I'm from, you have been proven so wrong, pal!""
""What?!""
""That's right. Meatbags and us robots live on Earth, even as I speak.""
""Impossible!""
""Sounds like you have a real problem with it, you sayin' ""Impossible"" all the time...""
""Can't be. My leader Megatron...""
""Who?""

Shockwave didn't get a chance to answer, as a couple of security-grade Decepticons entered the office, distracting Soudwave. The distraction gave opportunity for Bender to activate a control that was on his right wrist. Before the experiment, Farnsworth had the robot put on the remote unit as a precaution. All it did was adjust the robot's visibility to his surroundings that he was in, as well as give a recall signal back to Planet Express headquarters for when Bender got bored with the experiment, or something serious happened. Bender decided at that moment to go stealth to observe what was happening. The small robot hoped that he wasn't seen when the two additional mechanisms entered the area.

""What is the emergency Shockwave?"" The burgundy and black mech asked, weapon at ready. ""Knightstick and I were the closest when you sounded the alarm.""
""Do you see it Task'r?"" Shockwave ordered the guards' attention to his desk. ""There was a small silver construct on my desk here a klik ago...""
""I see nothing there but some empty cubes, Shockwave."" The other security mech, Knightstick answered back. Both security mechs had heard rumors of what Shockwave did in private: Task'r-Seven, who didn't like his superior at all, took such as true until proven otherwise. Knightstick had his doubts about the whole thing, but this call started a microkernal of suspicion in the red and blue mech's mind.
""Those are none of your concern!"" Shockwave retorted angrily, ""We have a security breach here, and that Autobot sympathizer must be here somewhere."" When Shockwave turned to inspect a stack of data pads on his desk, Task'r mimicked a motion to his cohort of throwing back a drink with his left hand, making Knightstick chuckle a small bit, accidentally distracting Shockwave from his search.
""What's so slagging funny?!"" Shockwave was angrier this time when he turned to face the two mechs. ""You two nickel-plated knuckle heads start searching my office!"" Shockwave turned to search the remains of his desk further.

While in stealth mode, Bender tried his best to contain his amusement. Seeing the interchange between the two other mechs only confirmed to the relatively tiny robot that his unannounced appearance to the larger blue-violet machine was more than random chance, but an opportunity to take advantage of the situation while he can. While coming up with the most diabolical plan his CPU can muster, he observed the action around him. The three gigantic mechs looked everywhere: inside consoles, behind fixtures, even behind what spare furnishings Shockwave had in his office: all places where a small construct could even fit into, but all clear of infiltration. An idea came to Bender: he heard that the humans used a talent called ""ventriloquism"" for entertainment purposes, so after researching what little knowledge he had stored on the subject, he decided to try his hand with it. The robot from the 31st century turned to the bulkhead furthest from the three Cybertronians, and shouted ""Hey you deuterium dum-dums, I'm over here!"" This produced the desired effect, as Bender actually made it sound like he was near the wall, causing the three giant mechs to continue their search over at the very wall the voice came from. Emboldened with his new-found talent, Bender then decided to try the wall that was behind Shockwave's desk. He noticed that there was an inset depression in the wall, possibly indicating a storage compartment of some kind: this would be perfect! He then projected his vocalizer energy in that direction. ""Hey! I'm in the wall behind the desk!""

""No! Not there!"" Was the only possible way Shockwave can show panic in his otherwise featureless helm, his sole optic nearly went pale at the thought of his minions finding out what was behind that panel, and mostly on how the infiltrator managed to get inside. In a serious mood, Task'r-Seven wanted to know what Shockwave was in a panic about. His motion to get at the panel was stopped-short by his superior. 
""I can't allow you to look there Task'r."" Ordered the blue-violet mech.
""Why not? As security, we have authority to search any probable place where any and all hostile elements may hide."" Knightstick answered plainly. As head of security while Cybertron is under Decepticon rule, the red and blue mech knew all procedures that pertained to his duties. It was a job he didn't take lightly, and he didn't want to see one of his own underlings being prevented from fulfilling duty in same fashion. Task'r's optics burned deep red of rage at Shockwave: he still didn't like the punitive measures that were levied against him for the debacle over an Autobot multi-face he was put guard on at a prior time: being cut not only in energon ration, but rank as well still didn't sit well with the burgundy and black mech for being made a scapegoat over the whole thing. Now this. The only plus to all that was being put under Knightstick's authority. The low-speed hover made a good ally of the large ground-based mech.
""Alright, alright!"" Shockwave capitulated, ""Only as long as I'm the one to open the panel.""
""Agreed."" The two security mechs said in near-unison.

Shockwave carefully positioned himself in front of the panel, backplates being the only thing that the two security mechs saw while he punched the security code. When the panel opened, Shockwave hurriedly tried to hide some stuff out of view, but Knightstick was quick to intervene.
""What are you trying to hide there, sir?"" Knightstick demanded; he wasn't about to have anyone, even Shockwave, try to hide anything from him. ""We have to take a look regardless of what you might have in there.""
""Alright then,"" standing up to let Knightstick have a look, Shockwave suddenly had a urge to steady himself by bracing against his desk. Not knowing if it was panic on what will be found, or quickly standing up made him a bit disoriented in his gyros in his over-energized condition. ""Just don't mess things in there too much.""
Without a word, Knightstick deployed an illumination device from his right wrist assembly and crouched down to take a better look at the contents. The first find was something the head of security never expected: a stack of hardcopy. Picking an issue up, Knightstick examined it.

""What the... ""PlayMech"" Magazine?"" Came the red and blue mech's reaction. He never had heard of such a thing before, and the document quickly became a curiosity to both he and his underling, as Task'r was looking over Knightstick's shoulder assembly to see what the fuss was all about. As Knightstick went to a pictorial layout, one could hear a pin drop as both mechs saw a seductive pose of a gold and lavender femme lying on her venial plates: her legs were bent up at the knees, with her lower legs in a ""V"" position, while she held a wrench gently and seductively in her hands. Acting quickly, Shockwave took the hardcopy out of his security head's hands and placed it on his desk, not realizing that Bender was still invisible. When Bender saw the picture, he was beside himself: of all the femmes he ever saw, none even looked as well put-together as the one in the photo he saw at the moment. He made a note to ask Farnsworth if there will be tactile upgrades for the system for a future visit, that is if he ever makes it back. He was about to check his chronometer, when activity distracted him.

""What is this slag? Playing with dolls for a mech your age?"" It was Task'r who sarcastically asked. He was better attuned to what what such things were, as his curiosity drove him to learn about Earth when time permitted; he even found that he liked the sport of Rugby as a result, but for pure Decepticon reasons, if anything.
""No!"" Shockwave retorted angrily, ""I'm conducting a science experiment.""
""Right, with Optimus Prime and Starscream dolls. Sure!"" Task'r's cynicism was thick.
""I'm seeing if Voodoo really works."" Snatching the crudely made fabric Starscream doll out of Knightstick's hand, Shockwave was quick to add.
""Human superstition, that's all."" Task'r was defiant, ""Prove it works, then I'll believe!""
""Alright, Mr. Smart-Aft."" Shockwave was equally defiant. He placed the doll on his desk, took one of the pins and plunged it into the doll's midsection...
<DIV style=""TEXT-ALIGN: center"">***</DIV>In the Nemesis, Starscream was in his lab with Hook, when a stabbing sensation in his own midsection caused him to double-over in pain.
""Hook!"" The Decepticon Air Commander called to his cohort, falling to his knees, ""There's that pain again!""
""Last time it happened, I couldn't find anything wrong!"" The Constructicon said when coming to Starscream's aid...
<DIV style=""TEXT-ALIGN: center"">***</DIV>""Well?"" Demanded Task'r.
""I guess I'll never know for sure."" Was Shockwave's only answer.
""Figures!"" With arms crossed over chestplates, Task'r was displeased with the alleged lack of results. He beamed angrily at Shockwave.

""I guess we'll never know who or what was here then,"" Knightstick resigned while getting up, ""Task, I think we'd better go.""
""Sure,"" The younger mech answered back. ""Probably just glitch mice, that's all.""
""I'll request a deep sweep of the facilities, if you like Shockwave."" Kinghtstick offered, ""Just to make sure there isn't a major security breach somewhere.""
""When?""
""In perhaps an orn or so, at best.""
""Not any sooner?"" Shockwave didn't like the answer he got from the security head. ""The situation calls for one now.""
""With the thinned-out forces we have: some on Earth and elsewhere doing whatever, its the best that can be done on short notice.""
Not believing at first that things have gotten to this point, Shockwave had to face the fact that he'd had to wait for a basic sweep of his office. Circulating air through his vents, he figured the crisis was over: the invader was truly gone. ""Alright, so be it then. You two are dismissed."" Both security mechs snapped to attention to give their superior a salute, and left the office leaving Shockwave alone.

Sitting back at his desk, Shockwave decided he needed another shot of Ultra, so he opened a drawer to his right to get to his secret stash. Dispensing a cube, he brought it up to his helm to consume.
""You can't get rid of me that easily!"" said the unseen voice, startling the unsuspecting Decepticon. Shaken, Shockwave accidentally dropped the cube; energon getting all over his thigh armor and the deck plating under pede.
""GAH! I thought you left me alone!"" The Decepticon was exasperated at the thought of having to deal with the tiny mech again. With his sole optic, he observed the uninvited guest slowly fade back to visibility.
""And what, miss all that fun?"" The small bot replied after re-establishing full visibility, ""You must have a CPU loose!""
""YOU CALL ALL THAT, FUN?!"" The Decepticon was furious, ""You made me look like a fool in front of my minions.""
""And I made it look easy too!"" Bender quickly added, while doing a mock-polishing of his finger tips in self-satisfaction.

At his wits end with this unwanted visitor, Shockwave tried to make a grab at the smaller mech, only to find that his right hand went through Bender, causing the hologram to shimmy a bit that didn't go unnoticed by the image.
""Wow, that's cool. I think I'll have you try that again!""
""No! Just leave me alone!""
""And if I don't?"" Bender challenged defiantly.
""GAH!"" In a fit of rage, Shockwave with a sweep of his left arm cleared the debris from his desk: magazine, empty cubes, and data pads in all. He then rested his faceplates in hand and weapon emitter, and cycled some air through his vents. ""I give up. Just please leave me.""
""Alright then,"" Bender hit the recall control on his remote. As he faded from view, the form of the small mech warned Shockwave, ""You haven't seen the last of Bender Bending Rodriguez!""
""I was afraid of that..."" were the last words Bender heard before the all became blackness.
<P></P><DIV style=""TEXT-ALIGN: center"">***</DIV>
At the Planet Express HQ in New New York, all personnel were on virtual pins and needles while awaiting Bender's return. None was most nervous about it all than Bender's best friend: Philip J. Frye. The human was pacing back and forth in front of Farnsworth's latest device, the Omni-Trans-Reality Portal. He was three-quarters distracted when the professor described the machine by stating that it worked on a variation of the Einstien-Rosen principle, whatever that was, and Bender was coaxed into being a robotic Guinea Pig in trying it out for the first time. If it really worked as Farnsworth theorized, safe travel to other times, places, and dimensions would be a boon to historians, scientists, opportunists, and the generally curious. Frye felt that something was wrong, and he can't for once be of little to no help for a change:
Bender was gone for over two hours.

""Will you stop pacing like that Frye?"" Leela, the cycloptic pilot of Planet Express' only ship, said in an exasperated tone, she had to literally put her arm out to stop Frye from his continued pace. ""I'm starting to develop a cramp in my eye just watching you, and besides, you've practically worn a way into Old New York by now!""
""Sorry Leela,"" Frye said in a tone that was impatient edging on the despondent. ""Bender's been in there for a while. We don't know if he's alright.""
""I'm quite sure he's alright,"" remarked Professor Farnsworth from a nearby table. He, Dr. Zoidberg, Amy Wong, and Conrad Hermes were playing Plutonian Poker while waiting for Bender's return: due to the nature of the Plutonian playing cards, everyone had to wear protective gloves as the cards were made of slowly vaporizing dry ice. ""I personally made sure he was wearing the remote before he went in.""
""Still, too bad you didn't install a way to see him in there. Or at least hear him."" Frye was displeased with the answer. In another half-hour he would need Bender around when ""Everybody Loves HypnoToad"" was aired, just in case the delivery boy went catatonic during the show; one time the robot managed to snap Frye out of it just in time for a bathroom break.
""Maybe on a later model, this is just a prototype: I don't want the surroundings to come in contact with the fields the OTR produces. The effects could be catastrophic."" The professor added. He turned to continue the game. ""I see your ten quates and raise it to twenty, Zoidberg!.""
The red crustacean was beside himself: the professor figured he was bluffing. ""GAH! I fold."" Zoidberg then snapped his hand in half width-wise, much to the dismay of the others.
""Zoidberg!"" Hermes spoke up, ""Only the winner can break his hand, not the loser!""
""Sorry."" Ashamed, the crustacean then got up to go to his office until everybody was alerted to the alarm on the OTR portal.
""Great, Bender has used the recall on the remote!"" An enthusiastic Farnsworth proclaimed, ""I wonder where and when he went to: maybe somewhere everybody exists in the third dimension.""
""Oooh, deep man!"" Said a voice in Nibbler's general direction. Everyone turned to see that Leela's pet was wearing a beret, sunglasses and playing a set of bongos. Dumbfounded, Leela and Frye just shrugged at each other; they didn't know that the little dark matter factory can speak when he wanted. Leela then looked at one of her hands and pondered aloud: ""Maybe everyone has an extra finger?""
""EWWWWW!"" Was the only reaction she got from everyone, en mass.

""Never mind all that,"" the professor told all assembled, ""I certain he'll have plenty to talk about once he emerges. I'm starting retrieve and power-down right now!"" Farnsworth then punched in a sequence that will insure the safe return of the test subject: it had to be done in proper order so that Bender won't somehow disappear due to some error, never to be seen or heard of again. When this was done and powered-down, the entrance then revealed a fully functional robot.

Bender emerged from the holographic projection chamber of Farnsworth's latest invention, the robot was ecstatic.
""Farnsworth!"" The mech couldn't contain his glee for a moment, ""Save those settings on that trans-time-dimension thingomajig you made!"" Bender then produced another cigar and lit it, taking in one huge drag, and said while exhausting it. ""Thanks to you, I now have a drinkin' buddy. A real big and miserable one at that!""

[Memory File:PDA00015:Accessed:Begin Playback...]
""EPSILON!"" Gamma hurriedly leapt off the stage into the audience section, landing a couple yards from where his spark brother lay, ""Who did this?""

""Gahm...help...""

""Take it easy Epi, I'm here."" Gamma approached his prone brother, with Jazz coming from the stage via a stairwell from stage left. When optics of both mechs adjusted to the lighting in the audience section, they were held aghast at Epsilon's condition: they noticed that Gamma's twin was in a sizeable pool of mech fluid, and that Epsilon's right arm was mostly severed. Crouching down, Gamma noticed that wasn't the only damage the other brown mech had sustained. There were multiple impact points that were inflicted his sides and intact left arm, as well as his helm; these wounds alone seemed to not be of a kind where instant deactivation would occur, they seemed of a kind where a blunt object was used instead, as there were dents and broken faceplates. After the initial visual shock, Jazz was the first to speak. ""We better carefully get him on his backplates.""
Concerned, Gamma didn't like the idea. ""You sure thats wise?""
""I have some, eh, first aid knowledge. I can shunt some of the critical systems so getting him medical attention in a more stable state..."" Jazz tried hard to hide the fact that he was going to actually to try to copy the data he thought Epsilon had in its entirety while doing first aid, without knowing that it was Gamma, actually his instrument interface, that held the bulk of the data. The original assignment from the Council was to meet up with the older Antares brother to escort Epsilon to the Prime personally to transfer the info of the burgeoning Decepticon rebellion: personnel, plans, battle tactics, everything Epsilon managed to gather while infiltrating the enclave. All this was threatened to be lost if Epsilon off-lined permanently. He had managed to convince Gamma to this point that he was just there to enjoy the show, without letting on that he knew Epsilon all this time.
""... will be possible,"" Jazz continued, while reaching under the damaged mech's left side. ""I can use a hand here.""
Reluctantly, the damaged mech's twin silently assisted in turning around his brother, changing position to the other side to gently place his fallen sibling on his back. When Gamma glanced at Epsilon's true extent of damage, a horrified look washed over his face plates. The entire front of the mech looked like it took the brunt of the impacts, badly dented and ripped armor plates exposed wiring and energon pathways that were still leaking what little was left. Epsilon's helm also showed its share of severe damage: the mech's right optic was smashed out, the top of his helm was broken away, leaving partially exposed his processing cluster.
""Stand aside Gamma."" Jazz was quick to act, starting to work on the damaged mech, doing the best as he can. When Jazz was about to connect a transfer cable between him and the Epsilon, the damaged mech managed to stop him with his left arm.
""Nuh-nun-oh, Juh-hazz!""
""My brother knows you?!"" A shocked Gamma jumped in.
""Gamma, please!"" Turning back to Epsilon, Jazz spoke to the injured mech.""You know why I'm here, agent!""
""Duh-huh-hont hav-have t-t-t-t-it any muh-muh-muh-or-or-ore!"" the dying mech was barely getting any words out of his vocalizer, critical pathways tried to re-route around the damage with little, if any success.
Frantic about the news, Jazz was gently prodding for information.""Your attackers have it?""
The fatally wounded mech tried to shake his helm, but couldn't twist it to the right all the way, ""N-n-unh No! Ga-gahm?""
""Epi, my brother, I'm here."" The intact twin gently approached his damaged brother. Gamma kneeled down on his left knee assembly. ""Do you need some of my parts to stay functional? I'll do it in a spark pulse without asking...""
""P-pl-plaeee yourrrrr-r-r-r ins-struh...""
""S-sure Epi!"" Gamma deployed his instrument within milliseconds, ""What do you want to hear?""
""Ani-nee-thuh.."" With his left arm, Epsilon reached for the instrument, and without Gamma looking, attached a data transfer cable to the instrument. This didn't go unnoticed by Jazz, who was quickly surmising about who, or what, actually had the data he was ordered to retrieve.
""Don't strain yourself, sure."" Gamma gently spoke as he started to play something gentle and relaxing on his instrument.

The melody and harmonies Gamma played soared with ethereal grace: ring modulated harmonics rising and intertwining with a deep pedal tone that was warm as a rising stellar mass after a cold night, but there was also a sadness in the piece that mourned a past that can't be re-lived: a new day never lets the past return, but in memories do they remain. 

Moments later Gamma finished playing his instrument, he was satisfied with how he played it this time: he was executing the trills and partial chords in time with hardly an unintended accidental to be heard. When he was about to put his instrument in storage mode, he noticed the data cable coming out of it, leading to his mortally wounded twin. Quickly snapping out of his musician's trance, Gamma gently asked, ""Epi, why the cable?""
""F-file encrypt..."" was the only thing Epsilon could say before the extent of his damages caught up to him, causing his systems to crash permanently. With dimming optics and relaxing servos, the older Antares brother entered the Well of Allsparks, leaving a shell that was quickly changing from its deep brown color to a dull gray.

Jazz quickly leaned over the fallen mech to confirm on his condition, gently unplugging the cable from Gamma's instrument in the process. ""He's gone, Gamma. Nothing more I can do."" He said gently. ""Sorry for your loss.""

Wordlessly, Gamma stood up and gently placed his instrument on his back. The full weight of what had just happened was just starting to have an impact on the survivor's mind. Without knowing even if the newest member even survived, seeing his friends dead and witnessing the painful offlining of his brother was more than he could take, to the point of wanting to escape the carnage he was surrounded by.

""Whoever did this will more than likely come after you as well."" Jazz correctly spoke as he was standing up himself, looking around to make sure that nobody else was around. The possibility of somebody waiting for a chance to attack his new friend was too great, knowing now who had the data he was sent to retrieve. ""I know of some folk who will protect you Gamma, a real great bunch of mechs...""
""No!""
""What Gamma?""
""I'm not going. I want to be alone!"" Gamma shot back, the full impact of what happened finally slamming his mind hard with horror, fear, and mostly, remorse of losing those who he was close to. The feelings were hitting him simultaneously from seemingly all directions, to the point that Gamma needed to be alone somewhere to sort through it all.
""You can't be serious, what if whoever did this comes for you next?"" Jazz wasn't expecting the reaction he was getting from his companion: he'd figured after all that had happened, Gamma would be reasonable about his suggestion about seeking a location of safety protected by the others. Jazz correctly reasoned that Gamma had actually been the one who he was to meet, and not Epsilon as originally thought, and throughout the journey to Musidrome; from getting off a bombed-out overpass, through underground passages to find a ripped out backstage entrance to the carnage found in the main auditorium, not realizing that his assignment was mere micro vuns away. 
""Be reasonable for a moment!"" Jazz did his best to contain his frustration. ""Who will protect you then?""
""I'll take my chances.""
""Have you stripped a helm cog Gamma? You are in grave danger just by being here, let me comm-link...""
""Who said I was staying?"" Gamma was making his way back to the backstage entrance. He knew where he wanted to go, the Apocalypse be tossed in the Pit for all he cared.
""What?"" Tracking the larger mech's traverse up the stage's stairwell, Jazz tried to fathom the turmoil that Gamma was going through: not only losing friends, but also kin at the same time was something too much for the larger mech to handle, but what Jazz was offering the Neutral was safety within the Autobot faction under the leadership of Prime. 
""I need to go somewhere, anywhere away from here.""
""Then a friend or two and I will take you somewhere. You'll be safe.""
""I just want to be left alone for a while. Can't handle this..."" Gamma quickly stormed out of the venue, Jazz following.

No sooner did Gamma left through the ruined backstage door, did he transform into his vehicle mode and sped off into the array of access tunnels around the venue, leaving Jazz behind. The special-ops mech was about to engage in pursuit, when he received an urgent incoming comm from Iocon. Opening the link, the image of the new Prime occupied some of the real estate on Jazz's visor, which acted as a supplemental H.U.D. that the mech relied upon. Cutting to the chase, the Prime quickly got to the business at hand. The urgency in his voice was thick enough to cut with a plasma scalpel.
""Jazz, any luck in your rendezvous with Epi, er, Epsilon?""
""Sorry Prime. When I got here, it was already too late. Looks like somebody got here first and slaughtered everyone that was here... Epsilon included!""
""No! Silentwing, Torquer, even Gamma...""
""Not Gamma.""
""What?""
""Gamma was with me on the access-way to Musidrome when it got bombed. We had a real fun time getting ourselves down.""
""Is he with you?""
""'Fraid not, he must have went into emotional overload when he saw his twin off-line before his very optics. He hurried out of here, wanting to be alone.""
""Primus! He's in grave danger out there. If a Decepticon patrol sees him...""
""He's probably in more danger than you think. I saw Epsilon hook a data cable to Gamma's interface before his spark extinguished: Gamma probably doesn't know about the files.""

It seemed like forever for Prime to get the full weight of what was just said, but it was just a couple of nano-kliks when Prime spoke. ""Return to Iacon Jazz...""
""What about Gamma, the files?""
""I'll handle this one myself; I personally know a place or two where Gamma Antares might have gone to.""
""Is that advisable? Its not real receptive to any Prime right now out in the open.""
""I'll be fine, I know the neighborhood!""
""If you insist. To let you know, there's another member who isn't accounted for.""
""Their newest member, they called him ""T-A"". I'll keep an optic out just in case. Prime: out.""

When Jazz's link to the Prime was disengaged, the special ops officer let out a small amount of air from his vents to indicate a sigh, transformed and went his way in a different direction from where Gamma left to. He said a silent prayer to Primus that this new Prime would have luck in finding the brown mech who he befriended, hopefully in functional condition. As he rolled away, he didn't notice the gunmetal grey and red form emerge into the light streaming into the backstage area from the shadows. This mech, even larger than Gamma and Jazz combined, had the foresight to keep his dampening field on when the two other mechs were around. When the the mech with crimson optics was sure he was alone, he opened his comm-link.

<center>*****</center>
	'Figures the Vha'scuht(translation: scumbag) would lead me here.' Gamma Antares said to himself as he entered the abandoned warehouse. The Autobot commando was chasing the Decepticon Mercedes limo through the streets of Tranquility after finding him near an internet cafe in alt-mode, doing data acquisition of some kind. Gamma had to cross reference the personnel files his late twin had gathered to find out that the energy signature matched what was left at the scene of a recently killed Autobot foot soldier. A few days had passed since the no-show, and it took a chance patrol to find what remained of Wrongway and relay his location to reach Prime and the others back at the base. At the cordoned-off area, Ratchet and the recently arrived Gamma examined the damage that the deceased received, with Gamma noting the same kind of injuries that some of his cohorts in the Rigel Rowdies unit had sustained. 

After startling the Decepticon from behind, Gamma had to give chase when the Mercedes limo noticed the first year Pontiac Grand Am charging at him and bolted from the scene. He messaged the Autobot base for back-up just to be on the careful side; he knew Lacerate was a bit psychotic, so any additional numbers would insure the possible capture of the rouge.

After disappearing in the darkness of the warehouse, Lacerate was wondering who the Autobot that was chasing him was: that question was answered shortly after the hunter climbed up to the ceiling from what building support he did find. Gamma quickly emerged from his alt-mode, left arm converting to twin rail-gun mode. He did so while some street lighting outside the building backlit the brown Pontiac, revealing his caprine helm in silhouette. Only his amber optics could be clearly seen in the darkness.
""So what are you supposed to be: an Ibex?"" Lacerate's menacingly-laughter filled voice emerged from the inky blackness, deep within the warehouse.
""Coming from you Lacerate,"" Gamma said while trying to triangulate on his quarry's position with his audios; the echos and reverberations making such difficult, while side-stepping into the darkness to better conceal his own position. ""A tra's'loo (Trans: chump) like you shouldn't be speakin'!""

Hearing a non-Terran word being used at first confused the Decepticon, who then had to go through all the language files he had about the planet's multitude of patterns of speech. Finding nil results, the hunter angrily retorted, ""What did you call me, billy goat?!"" Trying to ignore the insult, the Autobot got a better fix on the arachnid but needed to keep his opponent talking to get a more precise fix.
""I'd have called you something worse, but there is no equivalent for ""Afthole"" that I know of."" 'Liar!' Gamma thought to himself in amusement, '""fa'Veloht"" is about as close as it can get.'

This got Lacerate to growl briefly in anger, ""Why don't you go chew on a tin can, goat-mobile!""
Slightly irritated, but mindful of his goal, Gamma tilted one of his audios down to a horizonal position to scan for elevation. He knew of the error-filled misnomer about caprine types, the K'Veht-sav included, and found the term idiotic to say the least. He needed his target to say something fast, something he can use for final triangulation. ""For a beat-up old mech like you Lacerate, I find that your database is just as corrupted as your spark!"" The Autobot rebuked harshly. What came next was a string of Cybertronian expletives, followed by the light of an incoming missile from the Decepticon's position. Upon hearing the expletives, Gamma managed to fire-off a couple of mortar shells from his rail gun, and moved as quickly as he could to the right when the missile's exhaust was seen. He didn't move quickly enough, but managed to get out of the direct path of the explosive. One of Gamma's shells managed to hit the support beam underneath the Decepticon, severing it in two, but it was the sudden mass shift was that sent Lacerate to the ground when he lost his grip. When he landed, it was hard enough to momentarily off-line him for couple of seconds, as his pain sensors went white static overload throughout his entire structure. When he came to, Lacerate found that he was under the rubble of a partially collapsed roof. Crawling from the wreckage, the scuffed-up Decepticon made his way to where his opponent was, machine guns at the ready. 'Who in the Pit is this Autobot, and how does he know who I am?' 

Gamma was still online after the missile that was meant for him left a gapping hole in the wall where he was. If it wasn't for calculating quickly to get out of the way, he'd be Poncho parts all over the place. Even though he avoided most of the blast, his HUD indicated a small lubricant leak in his left ankle assembly after a chunk of cinder block impacted his pede. When he heard movement from Lacerate's position, he quickly got back on his pedes, ignoring the pain sensor from his ankle sub-assembly. He quickly reached back with his right hand to get his latest version of his multi-face, and grabbed the handle. While bringing it around, he gave it a mental command to go into shield mode. Its main body stayed in its Autobot sigil shape, while the handle extended itself, segmented and folded back to be at the ready: Gamma knew about Lacerate's machine gun placements, which the shield offers protection for, but not the Decepticon's missiles. Getting in a ready position to continue battle, The Autobot commando observed two sets of ruby optics coming towards him. He was a bit surprised that Lacerate didn't open fire when the Decepticon got closer, but instead started asking questions. 

""Who in the name of the Pit are you, Autobot?"" Lacerate demanded, he wanted to know exactly the designation of that which chased him to the warehouse, and managed to locate his near-exact position to send him crashing to the ground. Was this an enemy specially built to out-hunt one of Megatron's most loyal of minions, or was this unknown construct someone who he doesn't recognize due to the vorns of warfare? He needed to know, even if he got off-lined for good as a reward. ""I'm not about to end this until I find out.""
""You remember Isobar, Chuckbit, and Miros?"" The brown Autobot asked in return.
""Should I?"" The Decepticon answered, taken aback by the unexpected question. He didn't know these unknown mechs his enemy had just brought up.
""I was their second in command,"" Gamma angrily returned, raising his primary weapon towards the hunter. ""... and close friend!"" When he did, his unit cuneiform etching of the Rigel Rowdies on his left bicep armor caught what little light poured from the nearby impact hole in the structure. Gamma's mind briefly went to the three dead cohorts: the times they had cracking jokes on each other, especially the always wise-cracking Miros. Gamma then remembered the remains of his friends when he returned from an extended scouting mission: the armor ripped open to expose severed energon, coolant, and lubricant lines: devoid of the contents that were instead in pools around the victims. He was still haunted by his grisly discovery so many vorns ago; if he didn't go on that reconn mission at the last moment when he did, he'd be among the dead himself. Regaining his composure, he reactivated the force coils on his rail gun. The violet glow of the coils grew in intensity. ""So it is my duty to either take you as a prisoner of war...""
""I won't allow that to happen, Captain Antares!"" Lacerate retorted, finally recognizing his opponent. He wasn't about to easily be captured by a lone Autobot bent on justice, or by any Autobot he'd just as well kill before that happened. Lacerate was about to let loose a round or two of one of his machine guns, when he noticed an approaching vehicle mode out of the corner of his optics. He hoped that this was the backup he requested himself while being pursued by the Cabrabot who is over twice his height in stature. ""You see, I didn't get all the Rowdies when my own unit attacked: you're all that is left.""
""No huy'tock (trans: shit), dumbaft!"" Gamma growled sarcastically, noticing the squad car as well but didn't give it any mind. It was sitting at the entrance to the warehouse, still in alt-mode waiting for its cue to act if needed. ""I won't be as easy to take down.""
""We'll see."" Lacerate proclaimed before lunging at the brown Grand Am. The Decepticon was suddenly flooded in the direct lighting from the squad car; headlights and spotlight going at full intensity to blind the optics of the arachinid-con in mid-attack. Lacerate suddenly felt himself slamming hard right into the hardened metallic surface of Gamma's shield, and then the sensation of suddenly being thrown backwards, slamming the concrete of the warehouse in a skidding, sparking stop.

""Slag it Barricade! Why did you blind me?"" Furious over the change of events, Lacerate practically screamed as he was getting up. By this time his outer structure showed more heavy denting and scratches: this Autobot <em>is</em> a tough one to deal with, a weakness must be found quickly. The answer that came back from the second form, now in bipedal mode wasn't that of Barricade at all, but from a blue-opticed Autobot.
""If you couldn't tell, I'm not exactly one of your own cohorts, Lacerate!""
""Prowl?! Slag no!""
Raising his own weapon towards the Decepticon, the Autobot S-I-C plainly replied,""Yes without a doubt. If you two are done, there's important business to attend to.""
Exasperated, Lacerate's rage was getting the best of him, ""What kind of business?""
""None of yours, Lacerate. Ours."" Energizing his main weapon, Prowl continued. ""If you value what's left of your structure, leave!""
""NO!""

Suddenly, the Decepticon lunged at the Dodge Charger-based Highway Patrol car, claws ready to rip into the Autobot, when he felt caught by the throat by a large hand that then proceeded to bare-down hard; the pain his neck components were receiving was excruciating. When he focused on where the hand came from, he found it was his original opponent who got to him. Gamma had also changed his multi-face to axe mode, where the sigil shifted around to produce a double-edged, energy enhanced bladed weapon. The Cabrabot poised it to strike if needed.
""Weren't you just told to leave, Decepticon?"" Gamma angrily growled at his prisoner. ""It wouldn't be good if you left in pieces!""
""Enough you two!"" Prowl demanded, showing some irritation through his ever present logical demeanor. ""Gamm, release him.""
""But Prowl,"" The Cabrabot exclaimed, while trying to maintain grip on the struggling Decepticon. ""He made a move towards you. You know what would have happened if I didn't act in time!""
""That I know. But just the same, fun time is over."" The Autobot sub-commander plainly said.

After a few seconds of contemplation, the Autobot commando decided to comply, but needed his opponent's assurance that further attacks weren't going to happen. Looking at the Mercedes right in the optics, demanding an answer. ""One wrong move and I'll cleave you, s'nt'az?(trans: understand?)"" After getting the gist of the demand, Lacerate nodded slightly. He reasoned to himself that he was outnumbered as well as out gunned, another opportunity might come around to even the score when Primus will permit it. Suddenly he felt the Autobot's grip loosen from around his neck, but not totally free until he was placed back on the ground. Feeling for damage, Lacerate found no sustained structural or systems damage that time and self-repair wouldn't take care of. Angrily looking up at the Cabrabot, Lacerate was about to say something when his foe cut in. ""Weren't you told to leave?"" Nodding slightly, Lacerate slowly made his way to the blast hole. Stopping briefly, Lacerate turned slightly to the Autobots and defiantly snapped a couple digits of his right claw towards them. Enraged, Gamma raised his axe and made one step towards the defeated Decepticon. Prowl reached for the handle, and stopped any further carnage. Gamma gave his superior an incredulous look. ""It is done, did you hear?"" Prowl said, as the Decepticon scurried outside and painfully converted to vehicle mode. The remaining mechs heard the Decepticon leave in a hurried fashion, but said nothing until the Mercedes was well out of range.    

""Sub-commander?"" A perplexed Cabrabot asked his superior, while storing his multi-face on his back.
""Yes captain?""
""Why did you have me release Lacerate? He'll only strike again.""
Prowl sighed to himself, does this have to be explained to every OC who makes planet-fall? ""Gamma, do you have your contract with you?""
""Um, sure.""
""Take it out, and go to paragraph 17, sub sections 21c~f.""
Gamma takes a stapled stack of paper out of a storage compartment of his right wrist armor, and pages through until he gets to the right spot.
""Subbaduh, yubbaduh... all OC characters must abide to the yhudda, yuhudda... Oh!"" When he finished reading the document, the Cabrabot's audios drooped all the way down.
""There you go captain. Your OC contract with the fandom stipulates that you have to act in a manner consistent which doesn't contradict with that of the established behavior of canon characters.""
""Even catch and release?""
""Yes.""
""Sahrg! (trans: FUCK!)""
""Oh, and captain?""
Downcast, the Pontiac raised his helm slightly to see his sub-commander. ""Yes sir?""
""Quit cursing in an alien language: your author has to make that slag up.""
""Sorry.""
""Don't worry about it too much. I do have some great news though.""
""Sir?""
""After Ratchet fixes that leak of yours, We'll both be heading to the Reno area.""
""Why there?""
""The Wreckers are about to make planet-fall: let's go greet them!""
""You think they'll recognize me?"" Gamma joked.
After a brief glance at the Cabrabot, Prowl shook his head. ""Captain, don't make me go into infinite loop!"" Both Autobots went into their respective vehicle modes and left the warehouse, heading back to the Autobot base.

<B>Characters/pairing:</B> Author (waves at reader), OC as plot bunny, mention of canon and other OC characters.
<B>A/N:</B> Written in about four hours <STRIKE>'cause I was that bored</STRIKE> to keep the creative mojo going. If it comes across as a very weird crack!verse, my job is done! Won't be announced on any of the TF or personal accounts.

<lj-cut text=""There I be, just mindin' my own bidniz, when...""><CENTER>$$$$$</CENTER>A human is seen sitting at a laptop in his mostly crowded room, surfing the Internet. The Author's room is partitioned roughly in half: towards the outside wall and running parallel is the twin bed. Across from the footboard sits a 21"" CRT-based RCA TV/VCR combo. The VCR had long ago worn out its heads, and has been replaced by a unit that is tied-in with the stereo system further down the same wall. On either side of the TV, bookshelf speakers with 10"" woofers sat upon what the owner had: for the left speaker was on its side on top of three wooden crates, each filled with vinyl records of LP size, while the right was on top of a shorter rack overflowing with DVDs. Though the speakers were on their sides, they were set in a way as to have the tweeters the furthest from each other. A smaller speaker for center-channel sound was perched on top of the TV, with two ball caps, one for the Cleveland Indians and one the city's NFL team, collecting dust on top of that. The other half of the bedroom, right next to the sliding doors of his closet, is dedicated to the Author's computer desk and music gear. A sixteen-space rack is off to his left, while a Deltex stand holding up a covered 61 key synth is angled in to denote the area further.

While the Author was surfing, a brown figure materializes, human size, into the small area between the stereo and in front of the keyboard stand. When the figure sees what the Author is doing, he then proceeds to let out a metallic cough to let the human know that the Autobot plot bunny was in the room.
""I thought that you were continuing to write my story? You haven't posted much of anything as of late...""
The Author turned from what he was doing to look over his left shoulder to acknowledge the visitor. ""Where the heck have you been, Gamma? Can't write much if you don't come around to yak about yourself, can I?""
""I see you point, but I've been busy as of late.""
Turning away to look at his laptop screen, the human replied dryly. ""What can you ever be busy with? Not much of anyone here knows you exist!""
The image folded his arms across his chestplates, irritated with the comment. ""To let you know, I have more of a social life than you ever will have, hermit!"" 
""Do tell."" The human sarcastically said while he looked out the corner of his left eye, shutting down his connection to the Web. He spun his chair to squarely face the virtual visitor. ""In my case with this economy, and the fact that partying of any kind gives me migraine, I'm saving money!""
""What happened to Lee's ""Stone Bunnys"" project? Didn't you have at least three songs to learn the bass parts to?""
""Yeah I did...""
""Did?! Why, what happened?"" The brown Autobot plot bunny was aghast with the past-tense answer.
""Dunno, we were supposed to meet up at L-5 a week after Doyle's funeral, but nobody was there. Never heard from Thompson after that. Kinda figured that they didn't need my services anymore."" The Author then realized something about that time months ago that he didn't ask about the last time the OC last shown himself. ""Hey!""
""Yeah?""
""Were you with us at the time, jamming on something with us? I swear that caught you in the back of my mind doing such. Did you...""
""The answers are: Yup, and Pit yeah you did see me jamming with something. I already made a replacement with 'Jacks assistance. I'll tell you about it later.""
""Wheeljack?! How many explosions happened during that time?""
""Only one, poor little Marshall stack..."" The OC bowed his helm down in mock remorse. The mech almost gave himself away with a stifled giggle.
""Had to have been one of Blackmore's old 200 watters then; bad, urm..., transformer.""
""Who, me or the amp?"" Gamma pressed for an answer.
""The amp. The power transformer. Couldn't handle the load after a while of his playing at full power.""
""Oh.""

Changing subject back to main path, the human had a few more questions. ""Other than that, what have you been up to?""
""Megatron and I went to the last Gladiators game in Atlanta. Got over-energized silly during the second half. We couldn't transform and Megs couldn't fly, we were that slag-faced. Nice to know that the House of D's leader is capable of showing his other side. Everyone thinks of him as some big silver meany or something. Everyone of Cybertronian origin knows better.""
""So,"" It was the human's turn to press for answers. ""How did you two get back?""
""Walked.""
""... O.o...""
""Plot bunny land has quantum doorways: enter you destination, and go when cleared. Humans should invent it.""
""Oh. So, what was everyone's reaction when you two sauntered back?""
""Prime: ready to give the both of us one of his speeches of profundity about responsible energon consumption...""
""Sheesh, not even I would want to sit through one of those!""
""No human known is capable of having the patience of sitting through one of those; I try to avoid it like a cosmic rust plague. When Megs' sister found out...""
""Oh snap, Novatrann! What she do?""
""She nearly went ballistic, saying things as 'being a poor example to her sparklings' and such. Something about being an uncle having to show certain traits for them to look up to and all.""
""As an uncle myself...""
""Yes, you know what she means then.""
""Right, especially when I'm also a godfather to boot.""
""Precisely! Certain standards to uphold, even with that five year-old TF fan of a nephew of yours.""
Changing subject quickly, the human asked, ""What else have you been doing, still snarking the NASCAR races and such?""
""With Chuck and the others? Every race!""
""I'll never know why a Monte Carlo based mech like Chuck would choose a human name.""
""Same reason why 'Ratchet' is 'Ratchet': named after a tool.""
""Oh. You guys still pulling that 'Unknown Comic' stunt on him: putting a brown paper bag over your head and going ""Chuckie, Chuckie, Chuckie!"" at him while doing pelvic assembly thrusts?""
""Not as often.""
""Chuck anticipates it now?""
""Too much, especially after Optimus pulled the stunt on him once.""
The image of Prime doing an 'Unknown Comic' bit was too much for the Author to handle. ""Oh my, even Prime?!""
""Why should you be surprised? You had wrote Optimus in a pink tu-tu earlier this year...""</lj-cut>"

<lj-cut text=""Yo, Kwai-Chang!""><DIV style=""TEXT-ALIGN: center"">][][][][][</DIV>Except for that brief incident between Gamma Antares, one of Optimus Prime's pre-war friends that is now heading a commando mission back to Cybertron, and Sunstreaker, one of the troops who was on the Ark with the Autobot high commander when it crash landed on Earth, the trip to Calico California was relatively uneventful. After getting used to his power output, Gamma started to analyze the vast desert that the convoy was traveling through. Stretches of arid lands, broken up with randomly placed sagebrush and other sparce plant life. He noted the similarity to the deserts of Gohn' Tacjh, remembering the days he spent away from the B'Suhl monastery just to speed along the lone, little used highways back on K'Veht. He'd go about as full speed as he could just to enjoy the thrill of speed for its own sake: after he and Epi were kicked-out of all racing, the opportunity to open his throttle wide was few and far between during Cybertron's ""Golden Age"". Gamma was still convinced to himself that the reason for the banishment was all a ruse to get the Antares brothers out of the way to make room for a newer generation of racer who'd not take ""dangerous"" chances, and see the race team leader's orders as final word and to not to be argued with.
	
All that was nothing but moot point now, there was no time for such pastimes when survival was more important. Sure there were pockets of racing here and there, mostly among the lifeforms that the war hadn't touched yet, but actually participating in a race wasn't something Gamma really wanted to do anymore. Before the war, music had pretty much was a better replacement in terms of teamwork; especially where his admiration of Silent Wing was concerned. The war put all that off-kilter even in that department.
	
Through the vorns and vorns the war had gone on, one was never sure that the unit that one was assigned to was the one that might have a chance to survive a while, especially the unit he was last assigned to, The Rigel Rowdies. That unit was mostly comprised of those who were discipline problems in other Autobot units, and transferred to one of the most desolate outposts the faction had. Almost everyone there was a problem dumped there for some reason or another, but Gamma was given transfer to be second-in-command over the Rowdies under a very unimpressive leadership of a mech called Omnibuss, who was seemingly more interested getting slagged on shots of Ultra with a High Grade wash, than being a leader of an Autobot unit. Fitting in at first was difficult, as the unit wasn't receptive to newcomers, made more difficult by the fact that real discipline within the ranks was close to nil unto itself; a determined mech like Gamma who had personal reasons to fight the Decepticons, was practically out of place being s-i-c to this bunch. That is, until he befriended a small circle of mechs who liked to do one thing whenever a broadcast of some obscure motor race was somehow picked-up on one of the frequencies that were scanned.
	
While watching the race, they had a running commentary, often times hilarious, to break-up the monotony. When jokes weren't enough, Gamma would deploy his Multi-face into instrument mode to play a tune or two for the others enjoyment. This bunch called themselves the ""Cracked Lugnuts"". When Gamma was invited to join in, the rest found out his knowledge about the subject very useful as those who were originally of the group weren't racers before the war, but just fans who used the diversion to take their minds off the current situation. But a diversion only, as life was otherwise not the best for the Rowdies where they were stationed. What happened to the unit as a whole wasn't a very pleasant memory for Gamma. By having the luck of being assigned a deep recon/scouting mission due to the fact that the mech who was originally ordered to do so was in medbay for emergency repairs, Gamma was four orns into his mission when he received signal from the base that they were under heavy Decepticon attack. When Gamma managed to return, the presence of the Decepticon unit on base with little or no Autobot signal meant that Gamma was too late to be of any help. In order to avoid imminent detection, Gamma had to do something he'd hoped he never had to do: abandon his comrades to their fate, find another unit to both inform the Autobot leadership of the Rowdies demise and to rejoin the actual war effort.
	
So started his lone quest.
	
When his search for another Autobot unit in the vast galaxy proved to be fruitless, sometimes finding a vorns long abandoned base of operations of one faction or another, he decided to explore where he can. Refueling both himself and his transport wasn't a problem: he'd land on a planet where in some shape or another, raw material could be converted to energon with the help of a on-board distiller that someone had the foresight to design into the vehicle's systems. At times the process took a while, so Gamma took the opportunity to explore the planet to pass that time. At times he'd luck on landing on a planet where there was sentient life, sometimes to the point of achieving the point of technological advancement of having mechanized transportation. For these, he'd trans-scan one of the native machines to blend-in unnoticed during his explorations. In these societies, he'd scan the frequency bands primarily to get a lock on what language was being spoken. This is when he'd tune in an entertainment frequency to hear what the native music was like.
	
What he heard amazed him. What he heard were not only variations of how an octave was sub-divided, he also heard timbers he never encountered before being used. Some of them were not even electronically generated. At this, his curiosity was piqued of such things as organic tonalities. When he heard the sound of plucked strings, he was pretty much locked into wanting to explore this means of sound production further.
	
But that'll be something for him to work on later. Securing the K'Veht-sav data was more important now. He must not let that data be accessed in any shape or form by the Decepticons, up to and including willing to destroy his captured multi-face without transfer of a single byte to his internal storage: his former host world doesn't need Megatron or his not-so-merry band of minions to complicate matters while K'Veht and Z'Dian Central Government were in truce negotiations at that moment. 
	
When Gamma made an emergency landing on K'Veht 350 Earth-years ago, both factions were twenty years into a dispute over the resources of one of the moons of the inner gas giant Galhrawh in a nearby stellar system. Gamma had a little time after landing to assess the repairs he needed to do to his ship's main drive before planetary defenses, called Skywarn converged on his location. Thinking fast, Gamma converted to his alt-mode and stayed beside the ship in hopes that the local dominate lifeform wouldn't notice that he was the pilot, but just another mechanism in the area. The fact that both the ship and his alt-mode were of alien design didn't help much, as when a commando team was sent into the ship to investigate in what they thought was a Z'Di invasion, they found that the interior and accommodations were for somebody much larger than they were, or even of a Z'Dian, which induced more caution within ranks when they proceeded to investigate Gamma himself: who himself had an interior area more in line of the size of the lifeform the Skywarn ground unit members were comprised of. After arrangements were made for equipment to arrive to impound the vehicles for examination, none of the members of the commando unit even suspected the smaller alien vehicle had any sentience of any kind. That stayed that way until both Gamma and his shuttle were secured in a hanger that was integrated into a mountainside some considerable distance from the landing area. 
	
Gamma's initial stay in the hanger was that of boredom while under surveillance until those who were in charge of studying both machines decided to hook the both of them to diagnostic computers to analyze the systems of the alien machines, which at first was difficult as the interfaces that both Gamma and his ship had wasn't seen before by K'Veht scientists. After the scientists successfully found a way to connect systems together, they decided to test Gamma first, as he was the smaller machine and chosen as the first test subject. While the scientists were going over what readouts that Gamma was willing to let them have, he himself stealthily tracked back their own systems to try to find out where he was; finding language files to communicate with his captors didn't hurt either...
	
""Bang!"" Something nudged Gamma out of his thought thread.
	
""Yo, Kwai-Chang!"" It was the voice of Jazz, who was trying to get Gamma's attention for the last couple of kliks, after having dropped his position to the back of the convoy. Optimus tried to reach Gamma via the Autobot comm-link, but didn't get a response, so he requested Jazz to personally to check upon the brown Cabrabot. ""Everything alright?"" Continued the saboteur, ""Looked like you were rollin' in your sleep.""
	""I'm fine Jazz,"" Gamma reassured his soon to be mission partner, ""This desert environment just reminded me of somewhere else, that's all.""
	""Oh...""
	""What was Optimus' comm?""
	""That we are nearing the site of the current space bridge, with an included map of the area. Wan' me ta 'burst ya a copy?""
	""Sure!""
	After receiving the data, Gamma analyzed it for ideas of how to get to the bridge with the minimum of fuss or damage to the surrounding town. What he came up with might work, but he doesn't know if any of the Decepticons that were there would have had in mind what he planned, but it would have to do.
	""Jazz.""
	""Yeah Gamms?""
	""We'd better get up front so I can tell Prime my plan. Some of it will be improvised though.""
	""Good thing I'm commin' 'long then, when it comes ta improvisin'...""
	""I couldn't ask for anybody better than you Jazz, because there isn't!""
	""You're being too kind, Gee. We better head up front.""
	As soon as Gamma had vocalized ""Sure"", both the Porshe and the Pontiac made their way to the front of the convoy via the high speed berm.</lj-cut>

[Fade In]
[Scene: Exterior of a house]
_Narrator_:
This is 275 Crooked Street in Berea, Ohio. This two story colonial in suburban Cleveland has the distinction of having a rather large field behind it.
[Camera pans to right of house, reveals small clearing of a field with a stand of trees stage left]

_Narrator_:
Alright, so it doesn't have a very large field behind it. Far from it. It is not huge by any measure, but it will do rather nicely. Besides, with this production's budget and the current economic malaise, this is the best we can do. 

_Narrator_(continues):
Anyway, it was chosen to be the place of exchange between the two leaders of opposing alien robot factions called the Autobots and Decepticons, who wagered on this year's Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and the New York Giants. By now, anybody who actually had some interest in this, instead of the extreme rules tiddly-winks match between Australia and New Zealand, now knows the final. It was New York: 17, New England: 14, and advertisements: more entertaining than most of the game itself. What isn't known, is how both robots fared in their annual wager. 

[Sound FX: Sound of diesel's horn blowing]
[Camera angle: North end of the street, blue and red Peterbuilt enters street from an easterly direction. Closely following are a black Topkick, and a silver Pontiac Solstice]

_Narrator_:
Ah, that has to be the Autobot leader Optimus Prime that is now approaching. Looks like two of his operatives have joined him this time. Oh oh, by the looks of it, it looks as though the Autobot known as ""Ironhide"" has something tied-down in his cargo bed. I'm rather guessing the wager didn't go as planned for a second year in a row.

Ironhide:
You sure I have to bring this with us Prime?

Optimus Prime (Transforming):
I'm quite sure of it Ironhide, know of a better way to get it here?

Ironhide:
Couldn't Captain Lennox bring it?

Optimus Prime:
Not even I would place him in such a dangerous situation. He's needed for another reason right now. Just stay in alt-mode for the time being.

Jazz (transforming):
Ironhide I understand Prime, but me?

Optimus Prime:
Watch out for those power lines in front of the property.
Bumblebee couldn't be here because of Sam's scholastic needs, and primarily you have been hanging out with the sisters too long: a little time away won't kill the three of you, will it? 

Jazz:
Somebody's missing my patented whole-body massages right now...
[brushes power line lightly]
Dr. Ratch was right about the tingly sensation! Oooh momma!

Optimus Prime:
I told you to watch it, Jazz!

Jazz:
Sorry!

Optimus Prime:
The real reason why you are here is that your sound system is needed for part of my ""consolation prize"" to myself.

Jazz:
That's why you wanted me to find a copy of that song?

Optimus Prime:
Yes.

Jazz:
[groans]
I was afraid of that.

Ironhide:
Optimus, do you really want to go through with that...

Optimus Prime:
Yes I must, it is part of the wager with Megatron. Unfortuneatly. Ironhide, stay out here in the street in your alt-mode. Hopefully this won't be long.

[Both Prime and Jazz walk up the long driveway that leads to the field, avoiding the utility lines.]

Jazz:
Have the residents of this place been told of whats gonna happen?

Optimus Prime:
Yes they have. In fact Mr. Keller was here in the area to personally tell everyone who has a home in the vicinity of what will be happening.

[As both mechs walk to the open field, they notice in a fenced-off backyard next door, a human male in his late 50s working in the yard. The human looks up and his face lightens with recognition.]

Ken:
Jazz? Prime? Don't tell me its that time of year again! So, who won?
Optimus Prime [stopped walking to talk with human, Jazz enters field and stops about 10 yards away and turns to face the conversation.]:
Kenneth Porter! Nice to see you on this unseasonably warm day sir! To cut to the chase, I lost the bet.

Ken:
Oh snap! Second time in a row?

Optimus Prime[slightly forlorn]:
Yes, again. I'm wondering how Megatron managed to do it again: picking the winner of your planet's Super Bowl is an inexact science at best.

Ken:
Maybe he flipped a coin?

Optimus Prime [thinking]:
Where would Megatron find a coin that's as big as a manhole cover...

Ken:
Good question.

Jazz [interrupting]:
Prime, Captain Lennox just radioed-in that the helicopter is now close to area. He's awaiting your order.

Optimus Prime:
Good, radio back with code: Green-Gold-Alpha-One, the area is secure.
[turns back to Ken]
Ken, you might want to get yourself and your wife Heather out of the area just as a precaution, like the others.

Ken:
Sure, we'll go to my daughter's place in Olmstead Falls. Thanks for the warning.

Optimus Prime:
And hope nothing out of the ordinary happens.

[Optimus rejoins Jazz and both mechs stroll towards the middle of the field.]

Jazz:
Lennox reports that he and Epps will be here momentarily, Prime. Sideswipe and Sunstreaker were really upset when they found out that you hide the Ultra from them.

Optimus:
The twins will just have to deal with it. I'm surprised they didn't know that the cubes existed in the first place!

[Both Optimus and Jazz come to a stop at middle of field]

Jazz:
So, when is Ol' Megs supposed to get here?

Optimus:
Should be here shortly after Lennox and Epps leave. That is if Megatron is prompt.

Jazz:
Should be since he picked the winner...

[cut away shot: Sky Crane helicopter is seen coming in to view, large platform suspended underneath that is covered by a tarp]

Jazz: 
Great, the pay-off just got here!

Optimus:
Excellent! Jazz, help with guiding the platform into place? The quicker this is done the better.

[When the helicopter comes to a stationary position over the field and above tree line, Prime gives hand signal to start lowering the platform. When Prime and Jazz get the platform to position, Prime gives the thumbs-up sign, unhooks the support cables and signals the copter to vacate the area.]

Optimus [while Sky Crane fades from view in background]:
We better get the tarp off, the Decepticons should be here soon.

[cut scene: another helicopter approaches area. It then lands east of the platform clear of any trees, transforms to reveal that it is Blackout.]

Blackout:
I see that you Auto-losers aren't reneging on the bet!

Optimus [slightly irritated]:
We Autobots *never* go back on our word, Blackout!

Jazz:
Scorpy with ya?

Blackout:
No, back at the Nemesis getting repaired: recent fight with Ravage put both in Medbay.

Optimus:
Where's Megatron?

Blackout:
Keep your transfer cases fastened in place, Lord Megatron will be here when he feels like it!

[cut scene: back on the street, a Saleen-based police car enters neighborhood, passing the opposite direction of the departing Porter mini-van. then comes to a stop facing Ironhide. ]

Barricade:
Why aren't you back there with the others, Auto-schmuck?

Ironhide:
Back-up!

[cut scene: opposing angle of street, Megatron arrives on scene in background.]

Barricade:
Why need back-up, less Prime decides to be a poor loser?

Ironhide:
I said back-up! Your exhaust stinks!

Barricade [annoyed, while transforming]:
Oh really! Let's find out about yours!

[cut scene: back at the field, reverse angle to show that confrontation in the street is partially blocked by house. Barricade (in mech mode) is shown in background walking towards a hidden Ironhide. disappears behind building.]

Megatron:
I see you have upheld your end of things Prime: three 100 gallon cubes of Ultra grade and the black stasis-cube that holds your humiliation! If you don't mind, I'll test the quality of the Ultra.

Optimus [slightly aghast]:
You question my integrity of such?!

Megatron:
No, no, no!
I want to make sure it is as great as last time!

Optimus [sighing with resignation]:
Indulge.

[Megatron reaches for one of the cubes. cut-to: close shot of Megatron's hand touching cube. Cube then dispenses a mini cube of Ultra (akin to a shot glass) that is the proper size for Megatron's size and mass. Camera angle returns to show Megatron holding the shot cube.]

Optimus:
Don't you want a wash of at least Medium grade to go with that?

Megatron [defiant]:
Decepticons don't need slagging wash!

[Blackout nods in agreement while watching his leader knock-back the entire shot-cube. When the Ultra hits the back of Megatron's fuel intake, the fire of its energy concentration hits hard.]

Megatron:
GWAAAAAH! [Looks at shot cube, then at Optimus] This is even better than last year! How do you guys manage?

Optimus [smirks, narrow-opticed]:
It pays to be nice to the host lifeform, you know.

Megatron:
Yeah, whatever.

[Blackout reaches for the same cube]

Blackout:
I'd like some!

[Megatron whacks Blackout's arm]

Blackout:
OW!

Megatron:
Not until we get the remainder back to the Nemesis! 

Blackout [contrite, rubbing arm lightly]:
Alright.

Megatron:
Now for the entertaining part: Its time Prime!

Optimus:
Uh boy!

Megatron:
Well?

Optimus [resigned]:
OK, OK. Let me open the stasis-cube, and get them out.

[Optimus opens the top of the black cube and removes first a perfectly made whipped cream pie and then a hot-pink tu-tu.]

Optimus:
I'm going to hate myself in the morning...

Megatron:
Then recharge until noon!

[Optimus gives his counterpart an ""Oh shut up!"" look while handing the pie to Jazz, then puts on the tu-tu.]

Optimus [embarrassed while wearing the garment]:
Alright Jazz, hand Megatron the pie. Please don't do anything hostile!

Jazz: 
Um, sure.

[Jazz walks to where the Decepticon leader is standing, exchanges pie for empty shot cube. Returns to Optimus' side without word or incident.]

Optimus:
Alright, is everyone ready?

Megatron [slightly impatient]:
Get on with it already!

Optimus [with resolve]:
Alright Jazz, play the song!

[Jazz transforms back to his alt-mode, top down and plays the agreed to song on his sound system. The song plays the into, then gets to the lyrics...]:

""You put your right hand in,
You put your right hand out,
You put your right hand in,
And you shake it all about,""

[While the song ""Hokey Pokey"" plays Optimus Prime replicates the lyrics into movement.]

""You do the hokey pokey
and you turn yourself around
That what it's all about.""

[cut scene: back to the street where Barricade (in mech form) confronts a still in alt-mode Ironhide.]

Barricade [furious]:
...Again Auto-dolt, what do you have covered in your bed?!

Ironhide:
I said it was none of your concern!

Barricade:
Is it a trap?

Ironhide:
Only if you want to be the Decepti-drone to spring it!

[Barricade lets Frenzy loose, who then jumps into Ironhide's bed to see for himself.]

Ironhide:
HEY! Get that glitchy twerp off me!

Frenzy:
M-m-m-me see, me see!

[Frenzy lifts up corner of tarp to take a peek. All he sees is a brown and orange storage bin.]

Frenzy:
Wh-what's in the b-bin?

Ironhide:
Nutin' you'd want to mess with, now GET OFF!

[Frenzy ignores the shouted demand, starts poking at the bin.]
[sound cue: metallic growling]

Frenzy:
Y-y-you d-do have s-something!

[Frenzy pokes the bin more which causes it to transform into a robotic, snarling quadrapede, still covered by the tarp. Optics a blazing orange in anger.]

Ironhide:
Now you did it you idiot, you woke Wolfgang out of his recharge! Wuffie wanna have fun?

[Wolfgang responds to Ironhide's vocalizer in an enthusiastic fashion by looking over his right shoulder plates, panting with a red neoprene tongue and wagging tail assembly.]

Ironhide [continues]:
Get the glitch boy, get 'em!

[Wolfgang shakes off tarp to reveal that he was patterned after a German Shepard, but 4 1/2 foot tall at the shoulders. He is brown with orange accents along the leading and trailing edges of his limbs with another running from his crown to his aft quarters, where his tail is entirely orange. his Autobot sigil is centered over his chestplate. When Wolfgang clearly sees Frenzy, his canines extend out to six inches and become emblazed with energy.]

Frenzy [raw panic]:
AAAAHHHH!!!

[Frenzy jumps out of Ironhide's bed, rushes to the hedges that are to the southern edge of the front yard of 275 Crooked St. to try to evade his pursuer, who himself jumps out after him.] 

Wolfgang:
Heh-heh, glitchy chase!

Frenzy [still in panic]:
Noooooo!

[Wolfgang chases Frenzy around the hedges, then Frenzy gets the idea to cut between the plants to try to evade his pursuer, but the Autobot canine pounces by going between the same plants, tearing them up in the process. Frenzy tries to rush to the stand of trees in the field by going around a neighboring garage, only to be intercepted by Wolfgang running around the other way in a burst of speed. Wolfgang quickly retracts his fangs to catch his prey in his jaws, and then shakes his quarry with a furious motion. This goes unnoticed by those in the field due to Jazz playing ""Hokey Pokey"" a little too loudly, until Optimus happens to catch what was going on during the ""Left Hand"" verse when he just happened to look that way.]

Optimus [shocked]:
What the...
[shouts] Jazz, kill the music!
WOLFGANG!!!

[Wolfgang after hearing Optimus shout, absently drops Frenzy. Frenzy then runs to hide behind one of Megatron's legs for safety. Ironhide and Barricade rush into scene from front of house.]

Optimus [infuriated]:
Ironhide, how did Wolfgang get loose?

Megatron [surprised]:
That's no ""Daggit""! I referenced what the original BSG version looked like!

Optimus:
Then you don't know Wheeljack and the twins!
[Turns back to Ironhide]
Again, explain!

[When Optimus is saying this, Jazz called out to the Auto-Daggit, who in turn rushed to the sabateur's left side and sat down contritely.]

Ironhide:
It wasn't me!

Optimus:
Oh, really!

Ironhide:
Frenzy entered my cargo bed and started to poke at Wuffie, err, Wolfgang's alt-form.

Barricade:
I can avow to this, but Iron-Aft here wouldn't tell me what it was at first. I had to deploy Frenzy to find out.

Ironhide [incredulous]:
IRON-AFT! Why you should be locked with a Denver boot for impersonating a law enforcement vehicle!

Barricade [defiantly]:
Yeah? Who's gonna try?!

Ironhide [lunging at Decepti-cop]:
ME!

[The Autobot weapons specialist manages to get the smaller mech to the ground. They manage to roll around a couple of times, trading punches before Optimus and Blackout manage to separate them from further battle.]

Optimus [quite angry, restraining his soldier]:
Ironhide, this was to be a peaceful event!

Ironhide [remorseful]:
Sorry Optimus, but Barricade and Frenzy got too nosy about Wolfgang. We should never have brought him, but I didn't want to leave him behind since I started to get along with that silly rodent.

Optimus:
I quite understand, since Wolfgang has pretty much become part of the team now. Why he sees Mojo as his ""alpha"" is beyond me...

Megatron:
Are you done getting all sappy over there? This pie isn't looking so good now!

[Optimus realizes the situation and lets go of Ironhide to turn and face Megatron. Remembers he's still wearing the hot-pink tu-tu.]

Optimus:
Right. Jazz, do you remember where you left off?

Jazz [returning to his alt-mode]:
Sure!

[Jazz then resumes the playback at the ""Left Hand"" verse, but not so loudly this time. Halfway through, Megatron starts to bore of the whole thing and raises his hand thats holding the wilting pie, ready to throw it at Optimus' faceplate to end the event so both parties can return to their respective bases. Wolfgang sees what is about to happen, and rushes towards the Decepticon leader. When Megatron notices the Autobot dog is about to come upon him, he drops the pie to bring his hands together to form his fusion weapon. Optimus seeing what was about to happen rushes to stop his counterpart from shooting the daggit.]

Optimus [grabbing Megatron's arms to aim the weapon away.]:
No Megatron!

[Fusion weapon goes off when pointing nearly straight up.]

Optimus [horrified]:
Oh Snap!

Megatron [defensive about actions]:
That Auto-Mutt was about to attack me! It was only a pie I was going to throw!

Optimus [looking in direction of fusion blast, while angrily removing tu-tu and throwing it in direction of stasis-cube.]
Just pray to Primus that energy discharge doesn't hit anything important!

Megatron [sarcastically]:
Like what, that stupid ISS?

[cut scene: in orbit over Earth. A ship from a different time and place (as well as Paramount property,) passes camera from stage right to left...]

Voice of Kirk:
Captain's Log: Stardate- 7141.4...umm, somewhat.
Due to Spock's modified time jump formula, we have found ourselves in orbit around an Earth where the Eugenics War never happened. We will stay in orbit and study the changes in this timeline...

Voice of Sulu:
Captain! Incoming weapons fire!

Kirk:
Shields up! Red alert!

Voice of Spock:
Too late captain, its already upon us!

Kirk:
BRACE FOR IMPACT!

[Bolt from Megatron's fusion cannon impacts the port nacelle's support pylon, severing the propulsion unit from the ship. Follow angle: on propulsion unit's decent into Earth atmosphere.] 

Kirk:
Damage report! Where did that weapons fire come from?!

[cut scene to: Afghan/Pakistan mountain border...somewhere. Switch to animation style: Terry Gilliam's ""Python"" era]

Osama bin Laden [to camera]:
...We are in jihad against the West for various reasons in which I, the leader of al-Qaida will now list:

[change camera angle to show bin-Laden standing outside a cave, talking to a digital camera set-up]

Osama bin Laden [continues]:
We, of al-Qaida don't like, and would like to see eliminated:
the Vista operating system
reality TV shows
Coke Zero
the designated hitter
the format war between BluRay and DVD-HD
crack!verse writings on Live Journal
small Hostess donuts (especially the powdered kind!)
And lastly, that abomination to Allah's ears, that most awful of songs...

[a shadow hangs over Osama, which causes him to look up, horrified by what he sees]

Osama bin Laden:
OH SNAP!!

[distance shot: the severed nacelle of the Enterprise lands Bussard ram-scoop first on Osama bin Laden, crushing him instantly. sound cue: crumpling soda can. the nacelle then falls over stage right. sound cue: anvil strike.]

[cut scene to: three Marines who were hot on Osama's trail, safely witnessing from a distance the al-Qaida leader's demise.]

Marine 1:
Oh snap!

Marine 2:
They killed Osama!

Marine 3:
Bastards, that's our job!

---

[cut scene to: back to the Autobot and Decepticon situation, they are unaware of what consequences that just happened. Things have settled down a bit to a point.]

Megatron:
Next year, warn me if you'll be bringing that Auto-Mutt around. He's a very protective construct. Are those fangs really that sharp?

Optimus [after securing the stasis-cube]:
Only when they are charged-up like that.
About next year, we'll have to come up with a different place of exchange. Somewhere more remote, yet somewhere closer to our bases of operation. The trip took us a little more than three days non-stop.

Megatron:
That I can agree to!

Optimus [extending hand]:
Until next year?

Off-stage voice:
Excuse me!

Optimus [without looking in direction of voice]:
I thought this neighborhood was cleared of all residents until ""all clear"" was given!

Off-stage voice:
I have one very important question...

[When all the members of both factions looked in the general direction of the human voice, there were double blinking of optics all around at whom they saw. All had some familiarity with who they saw standing near both black oak tress that constituted the ""real"" boarder of 275's back yard. Jazz couldn't contain his hysterical laughter about his recognition of who were standing there.]
Kirk:
Which one of you shot at my ship?

Optimus [shocked]:
It can't be!

Jazz [recovering from laughing jag]:
No other way Prime, James Doohan is dead! Heh!

Spock [classic brow raised]:
Extremely fascinating!

Megatron:
Still has to be a sick joke!

Scotty:
Nay it isn't, who's shot t'was it?! The Enterprise is less one nacelle!

[Microseconds went by until all Autobots and except for one Decepticon, all pointed to Megatron, who looked at all the accusatory fingers pointed right at him.]

Megatron [realizing he's outnumbered]:
Oh fsckin' snap!

[Fade to black]











[cut scene to: Hell, same animation style as before. Osama is seen chained to a flaming boulder... ]

Osama bin Laden:
No, this can't be right! I should be in Heaven with Allah!

Satan:
Think again!

Osama:
This isn't right, I'm not supposed to be here!

Satan:
I give you from two choices to what your eternal punishment will be:
Reality TV
or...

Osama:
What?

Satan:
An endless loop of ""Hokey Pokey""

Osama:
NNNNOOOOOOO!!!!!!!

<b>Feedback/Comments:</b> Yes, I could use the creative critque.

<lj-cut text=""Things are a little *too* quiet at Musidrome.""><div style=""text-align: center;"">***+***</div>[Memory File:PDA00014:Accessed:Begin Playback]
	It took both cars about several breems to finally get to Musidrome. A couple of Jazz' shortcuts didn't pan out, as wreckage impeded progress to the point where both mechs had to revert to robot form just to clear enough of it out of the way to continue forward. When they reached the backstage entrance, both noticed the large doors were ripped off, as if somebody much larger wanted to get in quickly and saw the double pocket doors as a momentary inconvenience to deal with.
	
""This isn't looking good, Jazz. Now I know something is  dreadfully wrong.""
""Really?"" Jazz cracked, but Gamma only shot him a look of disapproval.
""Not now Jazz, not if I don't know if the others are alright.""
""Sorry"" The smaller mech contritely said as he approached one of the dislocated doors. ""No blast residue. Definitely someone wanted to get in, not out.""
	
Examining the other door, Gamma's own knowledge about violent chemical reactions only confirmed what Jazz just told him, until he noticed the large indentations of where the intruder gripped the edge of the door to rip it out. ""Whoever it was, must be pretty big to do this,"" Gamma added. ""Don't like the looks of this. We better see if everything is O.K.""
When they entered, they turned left to a short corridor that led to the backstage proper. The silence was disconcerting; instead of the usual noises of a musical group getting ready for a performance, like sound system checks and fragments of songs being played nervously. Even the lack of laughter of Torquer the time keeper was missing.
""Too quiet around here Jazz, hope nothing happened.""
""Doesn't sound like anybody is here""
""There has to be, I see the stage is still lit...""
	
Gamma and Jazz noticed the band equipment in disarray when came upon the backstage-left area, sound reinforcement modules either knocked over or destroyed outright. External musical instruments that were to be neatly arranged for performance were as well broken or thrown about violently.
""Primus, what the pit happened?"" Jazz was shocked at the turmoil before him onstage. 'Who ever did this had to be the same one who ripped the doors off' He reasoned to himself.
""Where's the others?"" The destruction had Gamma in a panic, concern of the well being of the others upmost on his main processor. ""Epi? 'Wing? Torque? You guys here? T-A?""
""Who's T-A, Gamma?""
""Tasker-Alpha is our latest member Jazz, kinda moody at times. I just hope none of them were here when this happened.""
""I just hope it wasn't 'cause of who ripped the backstage doors open Gee, I don't wanna...""
""PRIMUS, NO!"" Gamma exclaimed in horror when he found a form lying still on the stage floor, behind what was left of some of the larger components of the group's equipment.
	
""What's the matter?""
""Silent-Wing."" Gamma said while hurriedly removing broken gear away from whom he discovered. ""She's been shot!"" When he got the area cleared out, Gamma noticed the gapping wound in the singer's chest plate where her spark chamber was located. It was gone. Blasted into nothing, leaving a hole that went through her upper torso sub-structure. Silent-Wing died instantly with that one shot. When Jazz rushed over to Gamma and his grisly discovery, he inadvertently tripped over a piece of broken band gear, causing the white and blue mech to land on the stage decking almost face plate first. By quickly putting his arms out to catch his fall, Jazz ended up looking that he was about to do push-ups. ""That was too close for..."" He stopped what he was about to say mid sentence when a reflection, caught his attention from the outer corner of his right optic. ""GAMMA!"" The larger brown mech wasn't paying attention to what just happened to Jazz; the sight of the femme and how he felt for her was pre-occupying him when Jazz called-out. When Jazz got up from his near prone position, he noticed that his new friend was holding the deceased femme gently in his arms in a tender embrace. ""Gamma?""
""Who could have did this to you, 'Wings?"" Gamma gently whispered to the dead femme, hoping somehow that she would answer.
""Gamma, I don't believe she'll be able to answer that."" Jazz tried to console the brown mech,noting the tender scene unfolding before his optics. ""She's too far gone."" Gamma looked up to Jazz, processing for a moment. ""Yeah, I know. But she wasn't the type to harm even a nanite."" After gently putting the deceased femme back down, the brown musically inclined mech got up to face his travel companion. ""You find something?""
""Saw something when I tripped. I think its mech fluid.""
""Where?""
""Upstage, near the percussion platform.""
""Slag, Torquer!""
	
Gamma hurriedly went to the percussion platform, itself a site of localized chaos. He found the much larger mech behind the platform, sprawled under the stage's built-in backdrop. The huge panel not only supplied back lighting for the stage, but also did so in a way that would have been tied-in to what music was being played in real time. The panel has somehow had dislodged from its mountings and was bearing full weight on the slowly discoloring form underneath.
	
""Jazz, I could use assistance in getting this off."" Gamma tried to lift the stage right vertical edge of the panel, finding it a bit heavy even for himself to lift alone.
""Sure, where do ya want me to lift?"" Jazz asked as approached the backdrop panel.
""My side, so I can get this off Torque.""
	
When both mech lifted the panel, still a task unto itself even when both were jostling it, the red and black mech underneath was found without helm: but not decapitated by the panel, but with tell-tale signs that it was blasted off. The discovery horrified both Jazz and Gamma to silence for a few klicks until Jazz found courage to speak up.
	
""Who'd the Pit would do that? Looks like this guy never had a chance!""
""I don't know,"" Gamma said with growing despondence, ""Torque was always known for making friends easily. Wicked sense of humor.""
""I would've liked him Gamma, but it looks like not much else to do here...""
	
Jazz was about to continue what he was about to say, including suggesting going to Iacon to report this situation and to arrange the proper treatment of the lifeless forms, when both mechs heard a noise from in front of the stage, down on the audience floor. The low metallic moaning of ""Gahmm!"" was unmistakable to Gamma. The brown mech approached the edge of the stage to peer down. In front of the stage it was barely lit to see the seats below, but the shadow that was cast directly in front hid a sprawled-out form from Gamma's optics until they re-calibrated to let in more light. Gamma was horrified by what he saw.
""EPSILON!""

<B>Summary:</B>&nbsp;Megatron and Prime make a wager on who will win Super Bowl 42, while the latest Lambo twin's desire for a pet goes haywire.&nbsp;
<B>A/N:</B> Second part will be written (hopefully) right after the final score. Yes, the latest Lambo pet was influenced by a thread (I don't have link) on the Padded-Cell website.

<lj-cut text=""Will they even pay attention to the halftime show?""><DIV style=""TEXT-ALIGN: center"">XXXX
O OOO O</DIV>Megatron waited with thinning patience in his office for Prime's call to come through. Once a year it was agreed that there were to be no armed hostilities between the two factions, a day where it would be battled vicariously by others and the Decepticon leader would place a bet with his Autobot counterpart on who would prevail. Both sides used the day off to otherwise relax and recharge and not have to worry about what the other side was up to.

*|Come on Prime, I can't wait all rotation for this!|* Thought the former High Lord Protector, as he was going through the day's reports on various data pads that was stacked on his desk. As he was reading Soundwave's greatly detailed and verbose screed, this time about how it was ridiculously easy for the intelligence officer to hack into social networks to gather data posing as an anthropomorphic version of a vicious, carnivorous creature called a ""cougar"", and a not too bright one at that to be on the safe side, is when Prime's call came through. Megatron activated the flat screen that was off to his left to reveal the image of the Autobot leader at his own desk.

#/My apologies for the delay, Megatron. The twins are causing a commotion here at base...\# the image of Optimus Prime started to explain his delay in calling when a mild explosion was overheard in the background. This caused Prime to leave his desk momentarily to shout out of his office door, #/Sideswipe, a daggit has no place in Wheeljack's lab. Get 'em out of there, NOW!\# It took a couple of minutes before Optimus to return within range of his own flat screen's optical pickup. #/Again my apologies brother, for the delay.\#
""Prime, what in the Pit is a *daggit*?""
#/The twins got the idea to build an Autobot-sized one from watching a few reruns of an old Sci-Fi series called ""Battlestar Galactica"", the original one, in where a human sparkling had a mechanical canine as a companion. Its been causing problems here all day getting into things, and almost knocking over Sam at one point, but otherwise friendly. Want to take it off our hands?\#
""Not really, we have Ravage and Scorpy for that kind of thing."" Megatron had to refuse the offer, what he didn't need right now is to have to deal with an Autobot dog adding to the territorial battles between the Decepti-cat and Blackout's symbiont.

""Prime, the reason for this call? We have an agreement at this point in this germ infested rock's orbit!""
#/Right,\# Optimus decided to let his brother's remarks about Earth and its abundant organic-based life slide get to the point of his call. #/You know both of us have agreed to put down the weapons for one day and let two factions of humans have at it for everyone's amusement in an event called the ""Super Bowl"".\#
""Yes, I know this. Get with it!""
#/Very well. We also agreed to place a wager on the outcome: with the loser supplying both the winner with three standard size energon cubes of Ultra grade, as well as the ""consolation prize"" the winner will use against the loser. Winner also picks first the next time around. Since you chose Indianapolis last year...\#
""I remember winning it last time; I had to hide that delicious Ultra from Shockwave, the lush would have went through it all in breems if I hadn't!"" Megatron was kidding about the remark about his science officer.
#/Like I'll ever believe that about Shockwave, Megatron. He's too seriously dutiful for that to happen!\#
""I was joking!""
#/Oh... Getting back on subject, who are you siding with this year?\#
""New York Giants.""
The look on Prime's faceplate was that of surprised disappointment, Optimus was hoping that Megatron would pick New England. #/Why is that?\#
""First of all, I'm going against form by going for the underdog this time, just because I can. Eli Manning might have inexperience going against him at this level, he has his youth to his advantage. Giant's defense practically kept Favre and Green Bay's offense from scoring more than they did. That last interception for the winning field-goal in overtime was all the convincing I needed.""
#/Good reasons.\#
""I also decided to go against the so-called favorite primarily because the only dynasty I want to hear about is a Decepticon Dynasty!""
#/Give me a break, Megatron!\#
""Heh-heh.""
#/O.K., I guess I'm going to have to side with New England then...\# As Prime was about to give his reasoning, a commotion was overheard on the Autobot's side of the link.

""What the..? Captain Lennox, get Sarah and Annabelle away from here: There's a mechanical rodent on the base!""
""Ironhide, no! That's Wolfgang the Daggit, don't shoot!""
""Aaaaugh it is huge... NO!""
In the background was heard the sounds of colliding metal on metal, and the sound of same metal falling on the floor of the base. Megatron could swear he heard something that came close to a dog's bark afterward.
""Get this rodent off me Wheeljack... Yeech, what is he brushing my faceplate with?!""
""His neoprene covered glossa, 'Hide. Wolfgang is licking you 'cause he likes you.""
""I don't like him one bit, reminds me of that bothersome Mojo!""
""Don't diss my Mojo like that!""
""Sorry Sam, but this rodent can be dangerous to you humans.""
""No he isn't, he is very trustworthy. I think Wolfgang can be programmed for guard duty or something.""
""Whatever 'Jack. Hey, why is he going to Teletraan's console?""
""Is he gonna do what I think... Oh shit!""
""Oh slag Sunny, we might have built him too well!""
""No no Wolfgang, NO! Not Teletra...""

The signal from Autobot base suddenly went dark. Megatron considered for only a nano-breem of what might have happened, turned off his flat screen to go back to reading data pads. ""I hope you remember where the pay-off was held last time Prime. Don't be late!"" Megatron chuckled to himself, ""It must suck to be you today.""</lj-cut>"

<STRONG>Characters:</STRONG> Soundwave, Thundercracker, Frenzy, Rumble, Ravage, Non-TF OC, and a rattlesnake

<B>Summary:</B> The cassetticons pass, in their own way, the time while Soundwave and Thundercracker get the space bridge ready. An outside interest must stall for time until the Autobots can arrive. 
<B>A/N:</B>I always wanted to see <A href=""http://www.calicotown.com/"">this actual desert town</A> being used in some way. Using it as a location for a space bridge portal was a logical idea. Yes, I've visited the place... back in the '70s! 2007 Movie!verse reference between Rumble and Frenzy was very intentional.

<lj-cut text=""Been watching too many Westerns recently guys?"">
<DIV style=""TEXT-ALIGN: center"">^v^v^</DIV>
__The ancient, by human standards, town of Calico used to be a moderately successful silver mining/borax outpost during the region's ""Wild West"" days. Nestled in the foothills near Yermo California, the town would have been another relic, slowly decaying in the California desert sun had it been not for the Knott's corporation seeing the interest in having such a place for tourists who were into all things of that time-frame in American history. The town has been partially restored, in spite of a couple of fires that threatened to do away with the little town altogether, so that tourists who braved the desert trek, can do such things as wander around, learn how the residents of the 1880s lived, and maybe get caught in the ""crossfire"" of a staged shoot-out.
On the hour, every hour.
__Today wouldn't have been different, but the town with its name spelled out on the highest peak to the north had no visitors that day, visitors that were human and spent money at the print shop that was next to the tram tracks that brought tourists from the lower parking area, or even at Lil's Saloon where the hourly shoot-outs happened. There were none. But visitors of a different kind were there instead: they who didn't spend money on anything, but took without asking, and didn't care if anyone or anything was destroyed in the process. Today they were not taking, but sending. They had setup a 60 foot ring on the grounds&nbsp;in front of&nbsp;Hank's Hotel after easily chasing both visitor and employee away from the town. Soundwave, the Decepticon's intelligence/communications officer wouldn't mind taking the time to cause a little mayhem upon those who fled, but had to stick with the task of sending badly needed energon cubes back to Shockwave and the others back on Cybertron. The ring that was the space bridge portal was near completion with the cubes stacked, awaiting transport, but three of Soundwave's cassetticons were nowhere to be seen, having wandered off somewhere after completing the task of chasing off the humans themselves.
__From behind the old schoolhouse, to corporeal eyes that can only see a column of desert dust whip up, actually appeared a 5' 10"" figure of humanoid shape and dressed as to fit-in with the climate and location of his current destination: tan chinos, black boots with a buckle to adjust snugness around the ankle area. He wore a button-down shirt, but had it partially open to reveal a black crew shirt underneath. He was roughly Anglo-Saxon in appearance, with a thick shock of wavy brown hair that was being contained at the moment by a Stetson. He was a field operative for the Alpha Dimension: a place in space/time that many sentients have pondered the existence of over the too many centuries, and hotly denied by those who were ""blinkered"" by the unyielding precepts of corporeal science and reason. He gently fingered a horizontally elongated four-pointed star that was on his chest, and started to speak. ""Alpha Operative Alexander reporting in: I'm at second assigned location after my stay at Autobot headquarters, and have Decepticons within sights. Appears to be Soundwave and Thundercracker, with no other at this moment. Advise?"" His answer came fast and clear, seemingly if the other end of communication was nearby. ""A-O Alexander, affirmative: do nothing until Autobot faction is in area. Be advised that Autobots are to gain access to the space bridge for data recovery ops. Assist without disclosure, the K'Veht-sav data must not be discovered by the Decepticons: A-O Jacob had a difficult, but successful time keeping Shockwave from deleting the data.""
""Acknowledged, central. Jacob probably was typing at lightning speed with all four hands just to keep up with Shockwave's one. Too bad I couldn't be there to add an extra pair.""
""Be advised as well, Alexander: Autobot called ""Tracks"" is close to discovery of of your presence at Autobot base during ""Gamma Antares"" repairs.""
""Want me to go back to suppress efforts after this is done?""
""Negative, A-O Alexander: Omniarchy orders no such action be taken. Let them compute upon what is found for a while.""
""No problem with me then. Alexander: out."" With that, Alexander stroked his badge to disengage his comm-link, and started to stroll towards Hank's Hotel, keeping an eye towards the south to the distant access road that was the only means of the Autobot convoy to get to Calico. ""They'd better hurry, it looks like after Soundwave tracks down Rumble, Frenzy and Ravage, the Decepticons will be ready to send cargo."" Within a moment, both Alexander's and Soundwave's question of the whereabouts of least two of the mini-cons were answered, as Frenzy walked onto the main, paved street of Calico from between the candle shop and Lil's Saloon, with Rumble entering the avenue just south of the Calico House Restaurant, facing each other with determination on both their faceplates.
__""I've been waiting for this a long time, Dead-Optic Rumble. You ready?""
""Yeah, Frenzy the Spazz...""
""Don't call me that, slag eater!""
""It fits, you over-energized bit bucket!""
""Shut up and draw, glitch-headed moron!""
""Go interface with a cop car!""
__At that, both Decepticons drew their smaller, secondary weapons and fired. Both shots missed, one blast hitting a foot to Rumble's right, while the shot meant for Frenzy impacted just in front of his left pede. A-O Alexander chuckled to himself, shaking his head in mock disbelief. 'Two truisms in existence: Day destroys the night, and the lousy aim of Decepticons!' Alexander wasn't the only one to witness the impromptu ""showdown"", as Soundwave himself had seen the whole thing at a distance while getting the space bridge portal's final control links established. ""Rumble. Frenzy. Where's Ravage? His comm is offline.""
""Exploring somewhere south of this rotting squishy village."" replied Frenzy, while keeping close watch on Rumble, in case his opponent did something unexpected; like shoot with better aim for a change.
""Quit messing around ."" Soundwave ordered the two mocking duelists, ""Find Ravage,"" then his vocalizer harmony lowered a minor third for emphasis, ""NOW!"" Frenzy turned to face his superior after he saw Rumble lower his weapon, ""Sure thing, you want us to split up to find Ravage quicker?""
""Do it!"" Soundwave's vocal harmony went to a major third with authority. Upon the order, both Frenzy and Rumble were airborne in low altitude flight. Rumble took a line down the tram way towards the small valley to the south and west, while Frenzy decided to see if Ravage was exploring to the east of the town where some of the mines were.
__'Now to go into 'Stall for Time Mode' until the Autobots show up.' Alexander thought to himself. Even if he did say anything aloud, it was quite dubious that either Soundwave or Thundercracker, who was keeping busy stacking Energon cubes in the portal, would have heard him anyway. A-O Alexander was dimensionally shifted enough as to be undetected to even Soudwave's highly attuned audio receptors. 'I'll start by making it look that some of the power couplings can't stay seated properly. Failing that, I'll have to improvise another 'Technical Glitch' or two until the Autobots arrive.'
__Alexander started by un-seating random power inter-connects from the portal at various points, reaching into the casing itself without opening the ring segment, but being able to see what he was doing to it. When his hand found a coupling he liked, he momentarily put his hand dimensionally in phase long enough to do the deed. To anyone native to the dimension, they wouldn't see a disembodied hand yank at a cable at all, but instead would just see the cable itself popping out of its intended fixture. Alexander did this at random points until alarms started to chime out on the portal's control panel that was positioned about ten feet to the north/northeast, near the entrance to Maggie's Mine.
__""What's wrong Soundwave? The space bridge sounds like its having conniption fits."" Thundercracker put down the compressed stack of Energon cubes he was carrying for transfer down near the portal's entrance when the alarms started to sound.
""Random power fluctuations. Reason unknown."" The Decepticon intelligence officer was frantic at the control podium, inputting commands for a diagnostic to pin-point the sources of the problems that suddenly happened. After the portal diagnostics reported the problem, Soundwave had to shut main power to the system. ""Power transfer couplings are disconnected, must re-establish.""
""But we doubly made sure everything was connected properly Soundwave,"" Thundercracker was standing to the intelligence officer's right side, watching Soundwave shut down the portal, and then saw the blue robot go to one of the segments to open an access hatch to make a visual assessment. ""There can't be all those problems all of a sudden!""
""Diagnostics don't lie, we repair the bridge now, Thundercracker."" Soundwave monotoned, ""Time is of the essence. check the other segments.""
__When the Seeker opened a panel on an adjoining segment, he found two cables out of place. ""There's two in here that came undone as well, I wonder if that Autobot saboteur Mirage is in the area.""
""Impossible, Thundercracker!"" Soundwave was working on another segment on the opposite side of the first repair. ""Even in stealth mode, he'd need to open the panels. None were opened before malfunctions."" After finishing with the re-connections in the segment, Soundwave inadvertently walked in the path of A-O Alexander, which gave the trans-dimensional operative reason to pause after sensing the darkness of the blue mech's spark, but Soundwave gave no notice himself. ""Wow that was a real cold sensation, do all you Decepticons have such a chilly regard?"" He then got the idea to walk through one of the purple and black Seeker's legs to test his question. When he did, it wasn't as cold as Soundwave's, but Alexander did notice something else about Thundercracker that gave him answer about the Seeker's future. ""So that's why Unicron will chose to make you Cyclonus! Didn't know that until just now."" Unlike Soundwave, when A-O Alexander passed-through Thundercracker, the Seeker did feel something a tad unusual. ""Soundwave, did you just feel something just go through you?""
""Negative, felt only wires to re-connect. You need emergency diagnostic?""
""No, no. I'm fine Soundwave."" The Seeker looked around to detect if anybody was around to force an answer out of, finding nothing but an abandoned tourist trap of predominantly 100+ year old wood structures. ""We'd better get this space bridge working again, quickly. This place is starting to give me the surges!"" Soundwave only nodded in agreement as both mechs resumed with space bridge repairs.
__It took only a few minutes for Frenzy to find the Decepti-cat Ravage. When the mini-'Con landed seven yards to the south of his fellow cassetticon, he noticed that Ravage was sitting on the ground, looking and growling at something in front of him. ""So what'cha find here...?"" When Frenzy walked closer, he found that Ravage had cornered a snake. This particular snake was sunning itself in the mid afternoon sun until it found itself trapped by a feline that had no fear about it in any shape or form. The diamond back rattlesnake was coiled tightly, tail shaking furiously, with its head held high, waiting for a chance to strike a blow with broken,venom filled fangs at the unusual feline. The snake broke the tips off its fangs after trying initial strikes at Ravage's forelegs, but being unable to penetrate Ravage's alloy hull, then tried to slither off until being restrained from further movement by a metallic paw. The snake then coiled back to await another opportunity for escape until Frenzy showed up.
__""Hey, looks like you found a chew toy or something Ravage. Wanna share?"" Ravage ignored the other Decepticon to keep an optic on the snake to make sure no further attempts of escape are made, when the mech leaned forward, giving the serpent a chance to strike again.The rattlesnake saw a chance to strike, and clamped onto Ravage's upper lip assembly, trying to establish a place to inject its venom, but finding nothing soft to grip into.
""Aaw, it likes you and is giving you a big snaky kiss!"" Humored Frenzy, finding the visual of a dangerous snake hanging off Ravage's mouth highly amusing. Ravage didn't find it funny at all finding a reptile hanging on for dear function off his mouth with Frenzy making light of such, so he tried to use a paw to nudge the snake off, but to no avail. Ravage then came up with the idea to try to shake the snake off, so he furiously shook his helm. After a few microseconds the snake let go, but ending up being flung right at Frenzy, causing him to flinch from the on-coming projectile, who didn't find having the serpent flying at him amusing at all. ""Hey, that's Starscream's department getting snakes thrown at him!"" Ravage gave a couple metallic scratching sounds to indicate amusement until he noticed the snake trying to make a get-away, slithering to the west in hopes that at least it won't be bothered anymore today while hiding out in a hole or in something else it could find. Not content in letting his prey escape further torment, Ravage quickly pounced on the reptile, and grabbed it in his metallic jaws, causing the snake to futilely jerk and shake a way out. 
""So who are you going to throw it at next, at Rumble?"" Frenzy asked, which gave pause to Ravage on what diabolical ideas to use his ""toy"" for: sneak it into Soundwave's chest cavity, and see what happens? Drop it on Starscream, to re-enact the incident in the rain forrest? Shove it up one of the Stunticons' tailpipes? Find out which Autobot has a fear of snakes, and... The last one was the most promising of all, getting even for the time he was ""caged"" early-on after shortly getting reactivated, even though the whole thing was a ruse to dispatch false information, being locked in that cage was something Ravage owed big time for, and using a dangerous organism was just the thing to try something when both he and Frenzy's comm-links came to life.
__""Soundwave, Thundercracker, anybody listening?"" The voice of Rumble over the link was frantic. Dropping the snake and holding it down with one paw, Ravage was intent to listen to Rumble's broadcast. The voice that responded was familiar, yet monotonic: ""Rumble, report!""
""Convoy of Autobots are approaching from the access road to the south!""
""Acknowledged, your location?""
""Here at this plateau where ancient humans are interred.""
""Hold position. Be ready in case part of convoy breaks for separate assault. Frenzy, report!""
""Frenzy here with Ravage, about a half mile or so to the south-east...""
""Return both of you to defend main access road into village.""
""At once, Soundwave. Out."" Frenzy then turned back towards Ravage after signing-off, ""Play times over for now!"" Frenzy then took off in a topographically close altitude back to the main entrance to Calico.
__Having enough of playing with the serpent, Ravage quickly crushed the rattler behind the head with his fore paw, and rushed off to join the others of his faction in battling the quickly approaching Autobot convoy.</lj-cut>

<b>A/N:</b> Nothing at this time.

<lj-cut text=""Shockwave doesn&#39;t have permission (Neener, dude!)"">
<div style=""text-align: center;"">O_o</div>
__""The whole slagging thing is locked-down!"" The frustration in Shockwave's vocalizer was increasing with each failed attempt to delete all the files off Gamma's axe; he can read the files to his spark chamber's content, but wiping the files off were a different matter, no matter what he did. Shockwave tried every means he knew to hack an access level to find a way deeper into the weapon, perhaps to find a way around the anti-Decepticon mechanisms that prevented its use in non-Autobot hand assemblies. 
""What kind of encryption is being used? I've tried all known means to deal with Autobot formats, there's something else here that is impeding any further tries to wipe these files off, but what is it?""
	__Task'r and Dead-Pull were watching all that Shockwave was doing with puzzled bemusement, they knew of their superior's knowledge in such matters, so dealing with an Autobot multi-use interface should have been a piece of oil cake to deal with. At that moment Task'r's processors branched to a wild idea about the Autobot symbiotic interface. ""Shockwave, is that axe sentient? Maybe it knows what you are trying to do and is preventing you from doing anything to it."" Without turning to Task'r's direction, still trying to key-in some kind of command over-ride, Shockwave reposted, ""Normally I'd take that into consideration, but there has been nothing on record that Gamma Antares' instruments of past were even close to being that functional.""
	__""Instruments, Shockwave? I thought it was just an axe/shield weapon that self-destructed if the wrong 'bot grabbed it. Just finding out that it is also used as a means of external file storage...""
""Are just some of the modes it has, Task'r,"" replied Shockwave, still manually inputting commands with his right hand, hoping one of his hacking tricks finally gets the task done. ""There's one other mode it has, but totally useless to the Decepticon cause.""
""Which is?""
""A musical instrument.""
""Why that? Can't he just play sounds without one?""
""In the past, "" Shockwave continued, "" Gamma was part of a very small segment of Cybertronian society that had knowledge and abilities in the manipulation and control of external sound generating devices, unlike this era where such sound generating circuits have direct connection to a construct's processors. Over many hundreds of thousands of vorns, more and more Cybertronians were built without the absolute need to program oneself to learn how to make music with an external interface, as direct connection to internalized sound generators only required that one aquire the knowledge to compose music. Gamma Antares and his antiquated, obsolete ways are of the things that Megatron will not lose any recharge time over when they are gone forever.""
	__After trying one more work-around, but failing, Shockwave had enough of the Autobot object for the moment. ""Task'r, you and Dead-Pull keep guard over the axe. I'm going to discharge one of the Seeker squadrons outside, and get some recharge time. Don't do a thing to it until I return."" With that, Shockwave made his leave via a side exit of the bunker.
	__A couple of breems later, Task'r and Dead-Pull heard low muffled voices of Shockwave and one of the Seekers in discussion before being replaced by the sound of three of the Seekers jetting off to where they were being reassigned to, followed by silence. With that, Task'r walked to the side access hatch his superior just left through to check if it was locked. Much to his dismay, he found it very much so to the point of giving up attempts to disengage the mechanism after a couple tries at the control panel. ""Looks like we're here for a while Dead-Pull, he locked us in tight. I'll try the hanger door controls to be sure.""
""Lock-in:Task'r:Boring Slagger!""
""Look 'Mr.Eloquent Speech', I don't like it any more than you do,"" Task'r was trying the controls for the hanger doors themselves, only to find them locked-out from access. ""So don't tell me I'm boring when you are not exactly the life of an energon swilling party yourself!"" After trying a couple more times, the locks error buzzer only confirmed Task'r's suspicions about Shockwave's intentions of keeping both Decepticons inside to guard the hanger. ""Slag, this one's locked-out too. We're here for the duration."" 
	__Resigning himself and his stilted in speech compatriots servile situation, Task'r looked around for something, anything to rest his aft on: a chair, a crate, anything at all that can be used, but finding the hanger devoid of anything that remotely could be used in such a situation. He approached the control panel of one of the analytical devices, searching the controls for a function that would provide relief in the face of encroaching boredom. ""Task'r:Shockwave:Ordered...""
""Yeah, I know what Shmuckwave's orders were. I'm not going to be stuck in here without some kind of diversion to pass the time with."" Task'r glared at the larger, all black hauler who was assigned with him for guard duty. Dead-Pull, as the name applied, usually hauled the war dead to either of two places: to be parted out for spares, or to the slagging pits to be smelted back to raw material for new mechs. Dead-Pull didn't mind what he did, especially when it was an Autobot corpse that was about to be smelted down. In fact, he verily enjoyed his ghoulish grim reaper duties as much as if not more, than Task'r hated his own. ""Besides,"" Task'r continued, ""I really want to hear what these sound files contain, unless you have a better suggestion.""
""None:Bored Too""
""Then that settles it, doesn't it?"" Task'r found the controls he was looking for, and activated them. Through a speaker that wasn't built for anything but speech, sounds loudly emanated that were alien in timber and scale temperament that neither robot ever heard before.
	__""Task'r:Waste Time:Slagging Noise"" A disgusted Dead-Pull remarked, trying to cover his audio sensors.
""Ha!"" Rebuked Task'r as he was enjoying what he was hearing. ""It might be strange, but I can understand what is happening for some reason. A lot better than hearing your stilted excuse for speaking, at least this has flow to it.""
""OFF:NOW!""
""NO!""
""Inform:Shockwave""
""Squealer!""
At that, Dead-Pull deployed his weapon and pointed it at Task'r, who in response did the same.
""Terminate:Noise:Now:Task'r""
""No I won't, gotta problem?""
""Task'r:Disobey:Orders""
""Dead-Pull:Killjoy"" Task'r mocked the other mech, ""I outrank you, barely, but enough to tell you to stand down and turn off your own busted vocalizer."" At that, Dead-Pull calculated a few milliseconds before putting away his weapon. ""Turn Down:Won't Inform""
""Acceptable."" Pleased, Task'r backed himself while facing his watch partner,weapon still deployed, to adjust a control to reduce the sound filling the hanger. When he found the control and adjusted it, the sound became more bearable in its amplitude, much to the satisfaction of his fellow Decepticon.
""Crisis Averted:Need For Battle:Nullified""
""Good!"" A greatly relieved Task'r agreed, while stowing his weapon, he really didn't want to have a shoot-out over the situation, he found this a compromise that was workable to both mechs while pretty much forced into baby-sitting somebody else's property.
	__Resigning himself to the fact that there wasn't anything but floor to sit on, Task'r sat cross-legged in front of one of the control/analysis equipment that Shockwave had installed for this venture, near the transport trailer. He noticed Dead-Pull did the same next to the side exit, but the hauler sat in a way that his knee sub-assemblies were nearly touching his face plate. Dead boredom descended throughout the hanger.
	__""Hey Dead-Pull."" Task'r wasn't even looking at his co-watchman, he was looking at his right index finger tap out a rhythm on the floor.
""Task'r:What?""
""You into the sports the squishies on Earth play?""
""Little Bit:Why?""
""Which one?""
""NFL:Squishies Damage Each Other:Funny.""
""Fragile scum, needing all that armor for hand to hand combat. Try rugby next time, they don't wear all that slag.""
""Rugby:More Squishy Hurt?""
""Lots more than NFL!""
""Recommendation:Heh-Heh!"" Both were smiling at that last one, until the music changed to a more mellow, and orchestral tune.
""Oh slag, recharge music!""</lj-cut>

<STRONG>Characters:</STRONG> Autobot convoy
<B>Disclaimer:</B> Doing this until plot bunny dies, but Hasbro makes moolah off official canon.
<B>Summary:</B> Gamma isn't used to something about his rebuild, much to the annoyance of one of the Lambo twins.
<B>A/N:</B> None at this time.
<lj-cut text=""Fighting within the convoy..."">
<DIV style=""TEXT-ALIGN: center"">OOooOO</DIV>
__The Autobot convoy to the Space Bridge for the most part was uneventful, traveling past the outskirts of a desert town. Gamma was having a bit of trouble getting used to the slightly larger displacement his new alt form had to offer in terms of power output. The higher torque alone made him spin both his rear wheels at times when the native traffic control systems gave permission for them to proceed on. His situation didn't go unnoticed, however. ""Hey Gammers, take it easy with the burn outs back there!"" Sideswipe was right ahead of Gamma in the convoy, with Sunstreaker right behind. The sound of squealing tires were annoying enough to the red Lamborghini 's audio sensors, but the debris kicked-up by Gamma's aft tires irritated the yellow Lamborghini to the point of radioing his twin to diplomatically deal with the brown Pontiac, or the situation would be handled by Sunstreaker himself. ""Sorry Sides, I didn't realize power plant improvements were part of my rebuild. I'm not used to this higher torque output my drivetrain has now.""
""Well watch it, will ya? You're getting Sunny really annoyed by making him eat whatever you kick into his majesty's grill.""
""I'll give it my best try then.""
""You'd better, freak!"" Demanded Sunstreaker. The mere mention of the word ""freak"" caused something in Gamma's demeanor to snap, causing him to lock his front brakes and apply full throttle to his drive train to let him swing around to face the yellow Lambo grill to grill. This action resulted in everybody who was behind them in the convoy to come to a sudden stop, with calls to get moving or questions from those further back as to what happened.
""You want to say that to my bifurcated grill, pretty-boy?"" Gamma demanded, engine practically roaring in anger.
""Yeah, Mr. ""They- had - to- split - my - grill - to- put - an - ugly - aft - lump - in - the - middle"", I said that you are a freak!""
That got Gamma's coolant temperature at nearly the boil-over point, so he transformed to his 'bot mode, ready to take on the tormentor. ""At least I don't get myself detailed every other orn in case a speck of dust sneaks through and lands on my dashboard.""
""For the record,"" Sunstreaker retorted while transforming himself, ready to defend his opinion with violence if necessary, ""it is every orn, whether I need it or not!""
__""I knew it, I knew it!"" Bluestreak tried to reply humorously while in alt-mode, hoping to diffuse the unfolding situation next to him, ""Inferno owes me half an Energon ration...""
""SHUT UP, BLUE!"" Yelled both the Lamborghini and the Pontiac towards the 280 ZX's general direction, un-appreciative to the humor being attempted. ""I don't need your jokes Bluestreak, not while I'm about to pound this 'Billy come lately's' faceplate into something more recognizable!"" Sunstreaker added, while still keeping both optics on the Grand Am. ""Alright Goat-cart...""

POW!

__Gamma brought a left-sided heel kick quickly up to the Lambo's lower faceplate before the sentence could be finished, sending Sunstreaker reeling into another Autobot behind him, then crashing backside first on the lane paint on the road. The force of the kick was as such that Gamma had to wheel around before re-assuming his battle posture, readying himself for any retaliatory move might be made. In striking first, Gamma belayed those hundreds of years of training and of especially, the discipline in how to deal with the taunting that he was just subject to. Early on in his stay on K'Veht, Gamma learned that it was better not to give-in to a provoker, but to instead find a more peaceable solution. Failing that, then the use of force is mandated only for defensive purposes. This point of philosophy might have been alright if K'Veht was enjoying peace, unassailed by the Z'Dians: a loose alliance between species of creatures who never let go of their hunting instincts, in spite of being capable of interstellar flight for about seven-hundred Earth years, but far short of the K'Veht-sav's own eight thousand years in such an area.Gamma's arrival during a lull in the hostilities at first was perceived as a trick that was masterminded by the Z'Dians to undermine K'Veht-sav morals, if not a weapon to quickly defeat the SkyWarn defenses of K'Veht's own star system. It wasn't until it was determined that Gamma was too far advanced in technology, even for Z'Dian science, that the K'Veht-sav even started to trust the alien robot that ended up among them.
__Sunstreaker quickly got back up to retaliate, noting the battle-ready posture of his. ""I see Billy-bot wants to play some more, don't you 'kid'? Two can play that game!"" Before Sunstreaker had a chance to even strike a blow for a blow, Bluestreak and Gears managed to restrain him, while Sideswipe and Beachcomber rushed to put themselves as a barrier between the two combatants, by radio order of Prime when the Autobot leader was informed of what was happening.
__""Alright you two, what is this all about?"" Optimus was as about as livid as he ever got since rebooting on Earth, wanting an explanation as to why an old friend of his and one of the troops that arrived to Earth with him on the Ark had decided to have a fight in the middle of the road while en route to the space bridge, which was still a good hour and a half of travel ahead of them to Calico, near Yermo California. He transformed and rushed back to where in the convoy to where the disturbance was, finding Sunstreaker getting off his aft and back on to his pedes, while Gamma was ready to continue the fight if needed. ""And the truth, unless it took a knock-out punch during all this!""
__Sunstreaker began, quite angrily, ""Things were alright until 'Mr. GTO wanna be' here started flicking gravel and trash into my shiny grill!"" The Lamborghini was struggling against those who were trying to restrain him, hoping on a chance to cause serious dent damage to his foe.
__""I tried to explain to Sideswipe that my drive train output must have been increased due to my repairs,"" Gamma tried to give his side of the story while letting his heat exchangers cool his processors, bringing his temperament back to more normal levels. ""Until Sunny-Boy there..."" 
""SUNNY!? I'll dent you for sure...""
""Sunstreaker, knock it off!"" Ordered an irritated Prime. Nobody ever called Sunstreaker 'Sunny' directly to his face plate, save for Sideswipe the other Lambo in the faction, or another Autobot who was bigger and stronger than him. To Sunstreaker, all others were fair game for some severe damage by his hands.
__Correcting himself, Gamma continued. ""Until Sunstreaker started with the 'Freak' and the 'GTO wanna be' slag, whatever a 'GTO' is, I was about to offer myself to fall back to the back of the convoy until I get used to my torque output.""
""Good idea, but I know you better than that Gamma, your finish isn't so thin as to let some insults bother you.""
""Can't explain it myself Optimus, I'll have Ratchet do a thorough diagnostic on me when my mission is complete. To be on the safe side.""
""Are you sure you can go through with this?""
""I'm almost 100% certain, it is a must sir!""
""Very well then. Transform all of you, and resume convoy positions: we still have a ways to go with no time to waste."" Satisfied with what he hoped was just a minor altercation, Prime was about to head to his lead position in the convoy when he overheard a still angry Lamborghini behind him.
__""This is far from settled, Antares!"" Sunstreaker was still struggling to break free of his restrainers, still wanting to even the score over being on the receiving end of a radial tread mark on his lower face plate.
Stopping his stride, the large Pontiac glared at his opponent, ""Does this planet have any race tracks?"" Gamma asked of Sunstreaker.
""Yes it does. Why?""
""Pick one, be there!"" Gamma growled with a devious knowing in his optics towards the younger mech.
__While Gamma walked to the back of the convoy, a chorus of whistles, mild chuckles, and one or two 'Oh Boy's thrown in around Sunstreaker. Puzzled about the reaction around him, the yellow Lamborghini asked Optimus, ""What's that all about?"" With mock incredulous in his tone, the Autobot leader decided to inform Sunstreaker: ""Didn't you know? Before he and his own twin brother were into music, Gamma and Epsilon Antares were well known as a couple of tough racers to deal with. Neither considered retaliation beneath them if something happened to one of them on the track."" As Optimus was briskly walking back to the head of the convoy, he turned his head around slightly to add, ""... And they enjoyed 'schooling' impetuous, headstrong younglings on the track just for the kicks!""
__After reaching the front of the convoy and transforming back into his alt-form, Optimus was asked by Prowl why did Gamma get out of racing for music in the first place. The only thing the Autobot leader was willing to say was, that in memory of Epsilon, the reason for the identical twins' ouster from all sanctioned racing will never be disclosed. End of subject.</lj-cut>

<B>Disclaimer:</B> Doing this until plot bunny dies, but Hasbro/Tankara makes moolah of official canon.
<B>Summary:</B>[Flashback] The trapped mechs were getting off a bombed-out bridge, until...
<B>A/N:</B> Wasn't able to update last week due to real life events getting in way. Age level of this posting account raised to 14 and above, Justin Case P.I.!

<lj-cut text=""Meanwhile back on the bridge, theyza swingin'!"">[Memory File:PDA00009:Accessed:Start Playback]
	__By this time, anybody else who was trapped on the overpass had congregated to where the five mechs were attempting to escape the situation they were in. In all, about twenty robots had gathered to one by one, taking turns to climb down the support column and swing over by the cable the lady truck who called herself Chromia was carrying in her cargo bed. The overall length of the cable was fortunately more than enough for the job, as both Gamma and the sports car who called himself Jazz had tied some of the remaining amounts to separate hand holds on either side of the access hatch, with the other ends tied around their individual waists so both Jazz and Gamma to act as ""catchers"" without accidentally falling off themselves, to the depths below from the little precipice they were alloted to work with, considering the situation. 
	__Cycles went by to get three quarters of the trapped off the bridge, with the last five waiting their turns after the robot who was climbing down to successfully make it to the service hatch, when an approaching sound overhead caused echoes to sound off the walls of the chasm. 
	__""What's that, where's it coming from?"" Asked the robot who had just made the swing across, after being caught and held steady by Gamma.
""Don't know,"" Jazz answered back, holding the swing cable for the next mech to use. ""Sounds like whoever it is, is coming fast.""
""For a rescue perhaps?"" Gamma asked. But before he received his answer, the three robots at the open port heard a commotion emanating from the overpass above.
""RUN! Get inside down there! We're under attack!"" Was the only things that they below could hear from the others above, before an explosion took out the portion of the overpass, with the five unknown robots with it. ""Slag! Get deep inside!"" Gamma was practically pushing the others inside the hatch, not even bothering to untie the cable around his waist, when a chunk of debris clipped the edge of the hatch precipice, with enough force to knock Gamma off what was left,  making him fall twice his height until the cable stopped his decent with a startling, almost painful jerk.
	__""Oof! Gah, that was close."" Recovering over the initial jolt, Gamma looked over his current situation quickly. He noticed that there wasn't anything on the wall before him to help him climb back up to the hatch, not even anything for his pedes. ""Jazz, somebody? I can use a hand down here. No fun finding out how a pendulum feels, that's for sure.""
""Gamma?"" Jazz was peeking down and around at Gamma from the hatch opening while crouched down, ""You alright?""
""No damage, but there's nothing for me to get a pede-hold down here to help me climb back up.""
""Try climbing up the cable itself: its holding you so far, isn't it?""
""I'll try, but I've never had to do that before.""
""When you get close enough, we'll lend a hand to help ya get in here. Just give a try."" With that, Gamma began a slow climb back to the relative  safety of where the others were.

<B>Summary:</B> Shockwave finds something that he didn't expect in the axe - Tracks' discovery of what was found on security tape.
<b>A/N:</b> Two smaller parts (sorry again,) made into one posting

	<lj-cut text=""Cybertronian iPod anyone? - Tracks' Startling Discovery"">__""Sound files?! That's all Shockwave?"" Megatron was trying to contain his anger with a light layer-thin veneer of disappointment. ""There has to be more than that. Has to be!""
""My apologies mighty one!"" Shockwave pleaded over the visual com-link, just as surprised over the initial scan results as everyone else involved, save for Task'r who was trying to stifle the giggles over the whole thing.
""After the preliminary scan of the axe,"" Shockwave continued, unaware of Task'r's amusement over the whole ordeal, ""It appears that the file storage areas are packed almost completely with these useless documents, save...""
""For what?""
""A massive text file. I'll open it right now.""
""I hope you find something more useful than what Laserbeak did; he came back to base in need of new weapons. Gamma appears to have a new faceplate, and knowledge of fighting abilities in ways that we don't know of. He's totally different now than back when he was just an angry Autobot bent on revenge for what I did to that spy of his brother and their friends. Any luck?""
""Nothing Megatron. Just copious notes about music theorems pertaining to some place called 'K'Veht.'""
""Search the document further Shockwave,"" Megatron's anger cooled to stark disappointment, "" there must be something he might have inadvertently put in: location, technologies, something!""
""Just an idea or two of amplifying a vibrating string using low-grade crystals. Nothing useful.""
""Wipe that useless data then,"" Megatron was resolute in his decision, ""and find a way around its self-destruct mode. At least its shield and axe configurations will still be useful."" At that, Megatron signed-off the link, rendering the screen on Shockwave's end dark. 
<div style=""text-align: center;"">----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div> 	__Back at the Mt. Hillary base, Tracks the Autobot sleuth, was going through the security tape at Tele-Tran's main screen when he noticed something about the footage. ""That's odd, 'Jumper come here and see this.""
Cliff Jumper was at a secondary console checking other security feeds that were happening at the same time of the ""incident"". All were too routine and devoid of any potential Decepticon intrusion to the point of causing boredom to settle in when Tracks called out to him, startling him back to what was happening here and now. ""What did you find Tracks? Must be better than this boredom."" After rising from his station and walking towards Tracks and Tele-Tran, taking position behind Tracks' left arm. ""This better be good.""
""In fact if I was human, I'd find this creepy 'Jumper. Tele-Tran, please playback the security file from point 15:21:01.6 to 19:14:05.7 and loop it.""
""Complying."" Was the only thing the Autobot mainframe said milliseconds before playing back the the almost 4 minute loop.
""I don't notice anything unusual Tracks,"" Cliff Jumper was unimpressed with what he was seeing to the point of wanting to join Optimus and the others. 'Battling all of the Decepticons single-handed was decidedly more enjoyable than this tedium.' Was the first thought that went through Cliff Jumper's mind, ""I'm going back to my post.""
""No Cliff Jumper, you're missing what I spotted."" Tracks was manually inputting commands into Tele-Tran, ""Take a look at this close-up of the repair bay's console, and you tell me!""
On screen, there was a close-up of the repair facility's main keyboard doing something only player pianos were built to do. Individual keys were being depressed solo and in tandem with other keys inputting commands into the console without visible hands in sight.
""Wait a minute,"" a concerned Cliff Jumper said, ""keyboards don't operate themselves!""
""Thats right, and without any need to.""  Affirmed Tracks, ""I'll have to check for any cloaking energies that might have been used in the area at that time. I can count out Mirage right off, as Ratchet was working on him nearby."" 
""For some reason I don't believe the Decepticons are behind this Tracks, a cloaked Decepti-jerk just waltzing in to mess with a repair bay control surface? With a whole base to do whatever in? Not their style!""
""And believing practical jokes are beneath them, if Gamma's current looks means anything."" Tracks replied in agreement, concluding, ""I'll have to take my time going over this evidence, I'll keep everyone informed if and when I find something more.""</lj-cut>

<b>Summary:</b> Ratchet's report, and a decision is made
<b>A/N:</b> To make up for yesterday's short post, something longer. Hey, two posts in one week; how about that!

<lj-cut text=""Your mission Mr. Antares, if you accept it..."">""...And then Bumblebee, Inferno, Smokescreen, Perceptor and I were were transported, along with some of the Decepticons, to a planet where the dominate life form was at least eight times larger than us."" Optimus continued telling Gamma about one of the more unusual situations the war's twists and turns had led them, as the three Autobots were making their way back into the volcano on foot to the main entrance.
""Wow, that sounds like a perspective adjustment by anyones book Prime. So how did you guys make it back?""
""A toy rocket.""
""Haw, now you're yanking my linkage on that one.""
""No I'm not Gamma, just ask one of the others that were involved.""
""Even better yet,"" interjected Wheeljack, ""ask those of us who greeted them upon their return: like Omega Supreme, he hasn't had a reason to laugh in millions of years...""
""Omega is here?!"" Gamma ask enthusiastically.
""Yes he is, but we usually leave him alone unless we need his services.  He prefers to stay somewhere in the planet''s wilderness areas."" Added the Autobot leader. ""Like Wheeljack wanted to say, Omega hadn't laughed in all that time until he witnessed how we got back.""
	__When the three made it back to the main control room of the Ark, Ratchet the faction's CMO, was waiting to give report to Optimus Prime his findings. ""Looks like I'll have to hold-off the rest of that one until later."" Resigned Optimus, ""What did you find out Ratchet?""
""After a thorough diagnostic of the automated repair station, everything checks out, but...""
""But?"" Asked Gamma, slightly panicked.
""No record of you even being repaired in the first place Gamma, not even stored specs of your old face plate remains. Looks like a deliberate and complete job. The strangest thing about this is...""
""Yeah?""
""Even though the station is programmed for this sort of repair work and to do the job unattended, even when I'm busy with another patient, it looks like somebody might have been there to purposely manually input over-ride commands. I did find alterations of command structures that happened at that time,  but security video showed nobody at the console.""
""Where was Mirage during all this?"" Demanded Prime.
""Powered-down in my med-lab. I was attending to some processor repair he was putting off until that time.""
""Any witnesses?"" Gamma asked for corroborating testimony.
""Yes, just Bumblebee. He showed-up for routine maintenance just after you were wheeled in and your repair had begun.""
""Where is 'Bee right now?""
""He and his human buddy Spike went out on patrol shortly after that failed practical joke..."" Optimus replied calmly, trying to let the part of ""practical joke"" land gently.
""Some joke,"" Gamma said icily, ""I should have known it was such when Wheeljack didn't demand me to keep my hand assemblies in plain sight. Rule number one in capturing a prisoner of war.""
""Now I know why, I think I still have a bit of feedback in my audio sensors from those concussive smoke grenades."" Wheeljack made a faux motion with his right index finger, twisting it in his right audio assembly. ""I all but forgot you had those wrist dispensers since after hostilities broke out. With all those explosives your systems can manufacture at a given moment, and now those throwing stars.""
""Those explosives came in real useful while attempting a rescue on K'Veht. Massive landslide to clear away to get to trapped travelers.""
""About this ""K'Veht"" you keep talking about..."" Prime interrupted, needing to know more about this mysterious planet Gamma kept blathering about.
""That's why I must get my differential back to Cybertron Prime, to either retrieve my axe or destroy it after I get a chance to transfer all the data that is stored within it that I've collected about the planet: history of the original settlers from Cabris; their mother world, their current military strength and technology... Everything!""
""And if the Decepticons happen on that data..."" 
""If they can decrypt it at all that is,"" Gamma responded knowingly, ""Then they too will have knowledge of the resources the K'Veht-sav have enjoyed for almost seven thousand years of occupation. I don't personally want any Decepticon to meddle in that planet's affairs. They have enough to deal with against the Z'Dians Alliance.""
""About what?"" Ratchet asked, trying to keep with the conversation.
""Same things we fight the Decepticons over, Doc: resources and freedom from tyranny.""
	__This bit of information meant only one thing to Optimus Prime: ""Autobots! I have concluded that Gamma will lead a retrieval mission back to Cybertron. The objective is to recover his axe whole, or for Gamma to upload his data to his internal storage to return here back on Earth for safe keep of his findings, and then destroy the axe itself. Jazz, Wheeljack, you two will join him in on this. Some of us will escort all three of you to where the space bridge will occur next, and you will join up with someone from the resistance underground on Cybertron, where hopefully she'll lead you three to where the axe is kept.""
""So who is this Autobot lady that's gonna lead us?"" Jazz inquired, hoping to sweet-talk a lady machine, even just to see a pretty feminine faceplate for a change.
""Heh, I know what you're thinking, but this isn't a social call Jazz."" Prime cautioned his OPS officer, ""From what Elita has told me, she's only a few thousand years old, too young for you!""
That brought laughter from everyone present in the control room for a few seconds. ""Besides that, the location wasn't disclosed over the comm-link in case of eavesdropping.""
	__""Prime, I just found a suitable replacement for Gamma's rail gun."" Iron Hide barged into the control room, not in want to waste any more time than it took to check the armory, ""In fact it might be better!""
""Let me see 'Hide."" Gamma carefully examined the replacement firearm, Iron Hide continued, ""I do think I have out done myself: a dual-barrel pulse rifle with independently phase adjustable charges."" 
""Wow, it will do nicely. Thanks!"" Turning to the Autobot leader, ""Are we ready Prime?""
""Indeed, now we are. Ratchet, Cliff Jumper, Tracks: stay behind and search for any more clues about the repair bay. Autobots: Transform and roll out!"" </lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Meanwile, back on that Cybertron bridge..."">[Memory File:235572EA:Resume Playback...] 
	__""What the..."" When the sedan that was in front of Gamma transformed back to robot mode, he was dumbfounded as to what just happened. ""Who'd take the bridge out?"" 
""I don't know,"" said the light blue truck in a feminine voice, still in vehicle mode, ""But I'd like to know who that nut-case that charged by us was, I...""
""That ""nut-case"" was my twin brother for your information,"" Gamma retorted angrily while transforming, ""If he hadn't made you two panic brake like that, you both would be at the bottom, smashed to bits right now!""
""You guys alright up here?"" Inquired an approaching blue on white sports car, ""Somebody just blew up the other end of this overpass just a moment ago, just after I got on.""
""You mean we're stuck up here now?"" The truck asked angrily, ""How will I get my cargo to Crystal City?""
""And myself to the Musidrome."" Added Gamma. ""I hope Epsilon made it there at least.""
""Going to see 'Steel Nebula' too, eh?"" The sports car said as he converted to robot mode, ""I hear they play music the old-fashioned way, with external instruments... Hey, what is that on your back, stranger?""
""Its my musical interface, I'm part of 'Nebula'. But right now, I'm more concerned about getting off this overpass. Any ideas?""
""I have a coil of cable in my bed if it will help."" Suggested the truck. 
Looking down over the side of the overpass, the sports car asked ""How long is it?"" 
""About 2000 mechanometers long, what's your plan?""
""Hmm, we can climb down with the rungs that are part of the support pylon that is right below us,"" The sports car was improvising on the fly, ""We'll use the cable, doubled over, to swing over to that access hatch down there, if it can handle our individual weights...""

<b>Disclaimer:</b> Doing this until plot bunny dies, but Hasbro makes moolah off official canon.
<lj-cut text=""Thats kinda on the big side, isn&#39;t it?""><div style=""TEXT-ALIGN: center"">)()()()(</div>__It seemed like almost an uncountable number of groons to Task'r since the recovery convoy had to go slowly on ground to reach the destination of where the Autobot object was to be taken. They arrived at a partially hidden bunker a good five hundred vuns from the Decepticon HQ itself. The bunker looked as large as to house a whole squadron of Seekers, if need be, but at this moment its sole purpose was to keep something secure from any attempts at its retrieval, as well as contain any potential blast damage if the incalculable happened... hopefully.
__The convoy came to a stop at a pair of 70 foot high hanger style doors at the front of the structure, all the flying members, save Task'r, transformed and landed to form a protective semi-circle from outermost edge to outermost edge of the hanger doors to further protect the transfer operation. Task'r himself transformed back to robot mode, his weapon at the ready, and stood guard near with the trailer behind him, with the line of Seekers standing with their collective backs to him, in front. 
""You, Starthunder!"" Shockwave ordered an emerald and white Seeker, ""Go to the top of the structure to serve as a lookout!""
""At once Shockwave!"" The Seeker said in a smooth alto voice while he assumed his new vantage point. After making a thorough optical sweep of the area, he concluded with, ""The area appears clear of any potential troublemakers, you may continue with the transfer Shockwave.""
__""Alright then, let's get this thing inside so the probe can begin at once."" Continued Shockwave as he keyed-in a pass code into a panel on the right side of the hanger. At the final keystroke, both hanger doors slid aside to reveal a huge open space big enough to accommodate nine Seekers while in vehicle mode. At this moment it was bare, all but one wall that was occupied corner to corner with consoles of test equipment, computer monitors, and other sundry machinery that were hastily assembled for the purpose of dealing with the misplaced object that they were about to deal with.
__""Dead-Pull, you may proceed. Task'r, you'll escort him in, I'll follow."" At that, the three Decepticons then entered into the bunker itself. As soon as they cleared the hanger doors, Shockwave went to a control panel that was on a inside wall, perpendicular to the hanger entrance to close the doors behind them. After pressing the close button, and making sure the doors slid to a close tightly, did Shockwave gave a command for the D-Con who was pulling the trailer to transform and help with steering the elongated cube into position, with Task'r pushing. ""Looks like we got here with not too much time left,"" Remarked Shockwave when he checked readings on the trailers control panel, ""I'll personally connect this stasis chamber to main power before the task of probing this thing can begin."" At that, Shockwave connected a power cable to the base of the stasis chamber control panel, and flipped a switch that was on a console in the facility. Instantly the internal power cells in the chamber were bypassed, the stasis/suspension beams glowed a brighter shade of orange in response. ""Excellent, now I must update Megatron on our progress so far!""
__""Contact M-Megatron himself, Shockwave?"" Task'r nervously inquired.
""Is there something wrong with that Task'r? Don't you respect our glorious leader?"" Outraged, Shockwave was about to point his weapon, which served as his left hand, at Task'r's head.
""No sir, I respect him as much as I fear his awesomeness."" Task'r knew the respect part was a lie, but it was better that than getting turned to slag on the spot by Shockwave, who seemed to believe him this time. ""Then with your permission, Task'r-Seven,"" Shockwave sarcastically retorted, ""I will be contacting Megatron... Right now!""
""Task'r:Exhaust Manifold:Chewed-Off:Heh-heh!""
""Weld 'em shut, will you Dead-Pull?!"" Task'r rebuked his fellow Decepticon quietly, still a bit panicked about the pending transmission to Earth.

__Off in the distance, a small, almost all blue female Autobot had found a hiding position to observe where the Decepticons were taking Gamma's battle axe. Bluestar decided to volunteer herself on the basis that her finish was a dark enough hue as to not to be easily seen by keeping to the shadows. She also believed that since she witnessed Gamma receive the near-fatal weapons fire during the ambush while talking to the visiting machine, she at least owed him that much when she found out, via Elita-One, that the larger brown Autobot's injuries weren't fatal as first feared. She followed the Decepticon convoy at a distance: not too close to be detected, but not too far as to lose them. All she had to do was to keep the Seekers within sight to act as a guide to lead her to their destination. She also kept comm-link silence to further insure her scout assignment wasn't detected: she'll have to personally deliver whatever information she found out to Elita when she gets back. But right now, she has seen just about all she needed to see.
__'Looks like Shockwave is being the stickler for protocol as usual. I just wonder if he'll be keeping all those gooney Seekers guarding the entrance... talk about over-kill.' Bluestar thought to herself as she carefully retreated from her spy position, making as little noise as possible. 'I'll have to use an elusive maze pattern to get back, just in case.'</lj-cut>

<strong>Warnings:</strong> Not for the mechanically squeamish - language 
<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I only have an OC or two to my name, Hasbro makes the moolah off canon. And other merchandising of such, let's not forget! 
<strong>A/N:</strong> Story inspired when I received my truck's tag renewal notice from Ohio a couple days ago, I remembered that I live in one of the counties that has a mandatory biannual test on the vehicle, so I extended this scenario to involve my main OC. I'd rather not involve canon characters in this any further than needed. X-posted.

<lj-cut text=""Into Ratchet's lab we go!...""><center>/\/\/\/\/\</center>""Alright Gamma, I can see you now."" Ratchet the Autobot CMO said while peeking into his waiting room from the doorway of his examination room. This was one of the most dreaded types of examinations he has to do to anyone, but under the laws of where the Autobots set up operations, it couldn't be avoided.

The brown, early 70's Pontiac stood upon his digigrade legs from the chair in the waiting room he was sitting in, and walked to the examination room, anxious over the type of tests the CMO called him in for all of a sudden. Gamma Antares recently arrived to Earth in bad shape, with enough damage to require a new face plate and a general rebuild all around, but there were some things about his repairs he needed to have checked-over by Ratchet that had bothered him slightly since: lashing out in anger and delivering a heel-kick to Sunstreaker's own face plate was something that was totally uncharacteristic of him, especially while en-route in the convoy during a mission he was in charge of. Gamma considered himself fortunate that it didn't escalate into a roadside display of full-bore jet judo as a result, but it still unnerved him that such an outburst happened in the first place. Gamma hoped that Ratchet will find an answer to that, as well as perhaps another issue or two he's had since then.

 Gamma meekly entered the examination room, noting the diagnostic equipment Ratchet had assembled around a set of dyno rollers that were inset into the floor. He couldn't help but also notice the rather large blue metal cage that was place around the dyno area as well, but not containing within it the diagnostic equipment or any other device. Within contained restraining arms on top, the sides, and underneath with heavily padded panels at the end of each arm. ""So doc, what's this cage for?"" Out of concerned curiosity the former racer-turned musician-now soldier asked the Autobot medic.
""Oh, its part of your examination."" Ratchet calmly replied, while making adjustments on an instrument panel, ""It'll keep you in alt-mode for the duration of the test I'm going to perform on you. Now please transform and position your aft wheels on the rollers.""

Gamma sighed, climbed into the cage and changed into his alt-mode. As soon as this was done and Gamma's aft wheels were straddling the rollers, Ratchet wasted no time in getting the cage snugly positioned as to keep his patient firmly in place, the only thing that wasn't secured was Gamma's hood, in which Ratchet requested his patient to unlatch for a more detailed visual exam. ""Ratchet, what kind of test requires such heavy-handed restraint? I can't even move a nano mechanometer in this!""
""Good! I can't afford to let my subject move even out of reflex during all this, just relax Gee."" Ratchet finished up by attaching sensors to Gamma's powerplant, and swung into place a fan two and a half foot across into his patient's front grill to provide air to go through Gamma's radiator.

When Ratchet got a thorough look under Gamma's hood, he had to hold back a bit of his surprise as he cross-referenced his database. ""I think my optics need calibration Gamma, but I think you have a 455 Super Duty by the looks of it!"" 
""Is that unusual doc?""
""Your alt-mode is based on an Earth machine that was slated to ship with such a powerful engine, but was dropped as an option at the last breem.""
""Why? Too powerful?""
""No, among other things, not enough parts could be made. That's probably why you couldn't keep your wheels from chirping at first, causing that incident with Sunstreaker.""
""I tried to tell him I couldn't help it, but 'Mr. Pretty-boy' was too busy insulting me to listen.""
""Yeah he can be like that. Gamma, start your motor for me please."" When Gamma started his engine, a powerful roar filled the room, decresendoing to an authoritative rumble. Ratchet went to some displays to see what the sensors were recording. ""Wow, look at those torque and total output numbers! I'm going to warn 'Mr. Pretty-grill' not to even try to race you."" The CMO then walked back to the fan to activate it, and told his patient to put his drivetrain in gear and to maintain a constant 35 mph pace. Before Ratchet went back to his instruments, he positioned blocking screens around Gamma's aft assembly: he knew what was next, but he couldn't afford his patient to even have a clue to what was about to happen. He absolutely hated himself for having to do this, and wished constantly that it could be avoided: Ironhide proved reason enough as to why, and Ratchet didn't want to be Wheeljack's patient again for as many vorns as possible.

""What's with the screens doc, you're hiding something?""
""Yes, my embarrassment. Keep speed in spite of what might happen."" While Ratchet was telling Gamma this, the CMO reached for a three foot long, very slender pipe that was slightly bent about a foot from the very end of it. The other end was attached to a length of hose that wound its way to one of the diagnostic equipment. ""I'll try to be gentle, remember: 35 MPH, please!""
""O.K. Doc, whattt-PRIMUS! GAH, GET IT OUT!!!""
Noting the raw panic in Gamma's vocalizer when the probe was inserted into his patient's tailpipe, Ratchet activated an Energon charge into the cage to restrain the large Pontiac better, while praying to Primus that this would be over soon for the both of them. An alarm got Ratchet's attention, as his patient was starting to exceed the rpm limits of the dynometer's design. ""GAMMA! Please relax and bring it back down to 35, it'll be over soon!""
""You son of a fsckin' glitch, get it out NOW!""
Looking at his instruments after Gamma settled a bit, Ratchet was satisfied with the results he was now getting, to the point where he told the Grand Am to shut down his engine and cool down, removing the probe in the process.

""When I get out of this Ratchet...""
""Will you relax, you over-grown sparkling! It wasn't that bad, I had to have it done to myself, even the others had to go through it; you're not the only one!""
""Alright doc, sorry. I never had to go through that before, not even while on K'Veht.""
""Just sit there in alt-mode for a while, and let the fan cool your systems while I disconnect you."" As Ratchet was removing sensors, he had to walk around to Gamma's driver side to get a better grip, he chose to go around his patient's aft side and was looking down at something when he noticed it. ""Unicron be slagged, oh no!""
""What is it doc?""
Checking his database again, Ratchet was horrified at what he accidentally overlooked before, the realization made him sick to the pits.
""Gamma, I'm afraid I have some bad news.""
""How bad?""
""I have to re-connect you: you have discreet dual exhaust. I only tested one side!""

Gamma's reaction to the news could be heard throughout the Ark: cursing in Cybertronian, K'Veht-sav, and english to anyone who could hear, as well as understand what ways Ratchet would be severely punished with.</lj-cut>"

	__When the two identically brown Autobots reached the outside area, respective instrument interfaces attached to their backs, the Cybertronian sun was still high enough in the sky to not require lights of any kind yet, but it was low enough to cause long shadows to start being cast. ""Huh, its getting late Gamma, got enough Energon reserve to race?"" Wanting to make up for lost time, Epsilon asked after confirming the solar position with his internal chronometer. 
""Why do you want to race now?""  
 ""To the venue, Dent-head!""
""Oh. Yeah I have enough to get there...""
""Then quit chatting!"" At this point, Epsilon quickly transformed into vehicle mode and peeled out, leaving Gamma behind in the bluish smoke from both rear tires.
""That retro-rat! He isn't going to just hole-shot on me and get away like that!"" Gamma himself then quickly went vehicle mode himself, and left his own rear tire tracks in his wake, chasing down Epsilon. One of Epsilon's neighbors was outside watching all this with exasperation: ""You put huge displacement engines in these kids, and they think they can race anywhere they want!"" With that, the turquoise robot was going back into his own abode to watch the current events streams until a sound of an explosion in the distance caught his attention: ""What was that?""
	__It didn't take long for Gamma to catch up with Epsilon,  who was now three-quarters of a mile ahead by now, but slowed-down to let his younger twin a chance to get within  five feet of him. When such interval was reached, both Autobots went to maximum acceleration they can muster safely for the road conditions. By this time, road traffic had lightened up to the point where the two could open up their throttles a little  more without much fear of rear-ending someone. ""I feel like going cross-country mode for this coming stretch Epi, you game?"" Gamma practically had to shout over his radio even when they were about nose to nose.
""I'm with you little brother: Hit it!"" At that, both Autobots simultaneously lowered their chassis by a couple inches, deployed ground effect skirting all the way from bumper to bumper, with spoilers forward and aero-foils aft-ward. With that out of the way, both cars opened throttle as far open as possible.
	__For about fifteen megamiles, this brotherly grudge match  continued uneventfully, weaving through sparse, slower traffic while trading the lead position between the two at more than 250 MPH. When the racers reached a two-lane overpass, traffic was a little  heavier for the brothers to continue at speed, so they both backed-off their throttles to make it safely around the others who were sharing the road at that time. Epsilon found his way around a truck and a couple of sedans to make it to the other end of the bridge before Gamma did, who himself got blocked-in by the truck and one of the sedans, who by that time had panic-braked when Epsilon charged past.
	__""FSCK!"" was all Gamma could say about Epsilon's maneuver just before an explosion took out the end of the overpass he was heading for, about 20 mechanometers ahead of him.

__""Stasis chamber status: Nominal Parameters: Ready For Transport."" The Decepticon at the controls of the chamber reported, capable of only a very basic, rigid vocabulary needed for the tasks he was required to do; either in battle, or in this case, operating the very cargo transport cube he will soon tow to yet an unknown location. The chamber itself  had to be extended out enough to accommodate the length of the weapon, as some width was also needed, to safely fit the axe head. The phase of getting the axe to the chamber involved a choreography of constant repositioning of tractor bearing Decepticons to maneuver the Autobot implement of warfare safely into the now size-adjusted cube.
__""I really don't see why all the fuss over this stupid Autobot weapon, is it really that dangerous?"" Task'r finally had to ask, his curiosity was starting to get the better of him.
""Why don't you reach in an touch it then? The last thing you'll ever remember is cursing the very existence of Megatron before this Autobot weapon dispatches itself, with you and your blaspheming vocalizer to oblivion."" Shockwave challenged the young security grunt, 'I wouldn't mind if he did, it would be one less discipline problem within ranks.' Shockwave thought to himself. ""Recovery party,"" he barked aloud, ""transform, and get ready to move out. Task'r, assume a close proximity escort position to the convoy."" After a chorus of ""Yes, sir!"" was made, the six Seekers resumed to their vehicle modes, took-off, and kept to a tight patrol of the area. Task'r then himself changed back into his hover mode: his twelve foot fuselage was mostly burgundy in color with grayish-black trim. He then deployed pulse cannon placements on his dorsal and venial surfaces, mid-ship, capable of independent movement and targeting. ""Task'r-Seven ready for escort duty Shockwave: further orders?"" was all he said after his transformation was done, 'Might as well do this one right, I'm already on somebody's scrap-list for today.' he continued to himself.
__The only thing Shockwave said was ""Decepticons, proceed to final destination!"" For some reason, Task'r wasn't made privy to where they were headed. He'll have to be an obedient D-Con, and go by the book, to soon learn where. </lj-cut>

""Uh-huh, I believe I got 'Metallic Sunrise' to the point where I might want to play it sometime during tonight's gig."" Epsilon's younger twin was very enthused about playing one of his own compositions this night, he just hoped he remembers to play it as he intended. ""As long as you don't get yourself distracted in any way, Gamma, you should be alright,"" Epsilon reassuring his brother, instilling encouragement, ""I'm looking forward to hearing it."" 
""As long as I don't get static in say, a ring modulator."" Gamma started to kid his older brother, who assisted in building Gamma's instrument, unlike Epsilon, who built his entirely by himself. Epsilon retorted humorously, ""That one would be for you to fix then; I only designed it, you messed-up in its construction! Speaking of such, since you have yours on your back, can I see it for a bit?""
""Why Epi, nothing is wrong with it.""
""I want to just check it a bit, we don't want it to glitch out on you in the middle of tonight's gig, do you?"" Removing it from his back, grappling hooks that secures the instrument to his back for transport, as well as utilized as a ""strap"" system during use, retracted back and went flush with the surface of the instrument's casing. Gamma then handed his instrument to his brother, pleading, ""Don't take too long, we must get to the venue in a few moments.""
""I won't, just going to give it a once through, that's all."" Was all Epsilon said when he turned away from Gamma. When Epsilon had his back turned, his right arm emitted a data transfer cable that found its way to the port he had Gamma build into the instrument. All this time Gamma thought it was only to back-up patch parameters and sample files, but its real use was being accessed: secret data storage.
___After making a ""cursory"" examination of Gamma's instrument, just long enough for all of Epsilon's files to be written to the stealth storage areas, Epsilon then handed back the instrument to his younger brother. ""Everything checks out Gee, I believe we had better go now."" This was what Gamma hoped to hear, as he was getting impatient for Epsilon to finish making sure his instrument was functional for tonight. ""Then let's go, less we miss final sound system configuration!""
""Let me shut down things real quick...""
""EPI!""
""I'm done, let's go!"" Epsilon said as he put a lock-out protection code into the console in his workshop area. ""Someday I hope you learn some patience Gee. You can use some at times...""
[Memory File:235571EA:End Playback]

___""One more connection, and that-should-do-that. Aanndd done!"" Wheeljack said with satisfaction. His estimate was right: the repairs did take half the time with twice the hands available: after Gamma pointed out that the antenna mast he was having problems with could be ""fixed"" with a little blast of a laser, the rest took almost no time. ""Thanks for the help Gamma, but I'm still wondering why the head masters of that K'Veht monastery you were at refused to be called 'master'.""
""Let's walk back to base so I can explain then. That is very much part of the society's belief system as a whole, they believe that they all are students of a 'Holy Master' whether one studied at a monastery or not. Those that run the monasteries rather be referred as 'Most Advanced Students', since they also believe that learning goes on throughout one's life.""
""Interesting,"" interjected Wheeljack, as he's learned so far about Earth's own ways learning, headmasters of Terran institutes don't have the same reluctance about being called 'Master'. ""Since it seems martial arts of some kind are taught there, how does it fit-in with their philosophy?""
""They see it as more as a means of disciplining of the body and mind..."" Gamma started.
""Like some of the 'Eastern' religions here on Earth. There was an old TV western that touched on this."" Concluded Wheeljack, while bringing up an example.
""T'Vee western? What's that?""
""TV? Oh, it is an older style communication/entertainment a.v. protocol that the humans still use, and western is a story telling genre: akin to historical fiction.""
""I think I understand now,"" then Gamma continued, ""anyway, the B'Suhl also use such discipline as a form of prayer or meditation to contemplate upon their deity.""
___Wheeljack's curiosity was picked at, it wasn't often he was involved in any discussion of anything of a religious or philosophical nature; everyone assumed he was just into making or maintaining the various systems that pertained to Autobot operations in general. ""Have you tried any of this?""
""Of course! I found such very helpful in relaxing my mind; I still think of what happened to the others that day, I still see them where they lie, destroyed before I reached them, Epsilon on the verge of permanent shutdown... sigh."" Gamma was on the edge of despondence.
""Losing your older identical twin and the others. Yeah, but we lost many friends that day, so you're not the only one Gamma.""
""I know. I didn't mind the Decepticon population up to that day, until Megatron changed all that. When we get back inside, I'll have to find a quiet place to meditate: these memory accesses are working me up a bit. Unless there's a Decepticon nearby to dismantle, of course""
___While Wheeljack and Gamma were walking back to the main entrance, they passed by an out-cropping of rocks and boulders: the kind of hiding place for a small Decepticon scout/spy flyer to hide behind while recording both the audio and video of the Autobot conversation that was happening below him. Intent of not disclosing that he was in the area, Laserbeak was sent by Megatron to find out if Gamma really survived, and if he would reveal any information on the axe that wasn't commonly known by the Decepticon despot. The only information Laserbeak was able to record was a conversation about a distant planet Gamma was on, plus subjects as: a mysterious mountain called 'Spornea' that nobody has been able to solve for the last seven thousand years or so, that all the youth of this 'K'Veht' planet are tested for entry into some kind of monastery; how few make the cut, and fewer still manage to complete such studies: it was never seen as a dishonor not to make it in, but a greater one to qualify for entrance, but nothing that would shed any light about the axe; boring stuff about another organic life-form to have to listen to, until Gamma happened to mention to Wheeljack: 
___""I think I've seen inside the Matrix in some of my meditations!""
""No, you couldn't have Gamma, nobody alive has seen what the Matrix looks like. Well, that kind of Matrix for certain.""
""What, there's another?"" Surprised, Gamma asked with incredulence.
""Gamma,"" if Wheeljack was capable of rolling his optics skyward, now would be one of those times, so all he did was a face-palm gesture while shaking his head. ""if you weren't new to this planet, I'd believe you were out of touch. I'll explain it later."" 
___At this point Gamma had stood still to let his fellow Autobot walk by, looking a bit perplexed about Wheeljack's remarks, when his audio sensors picked up a noise of metal scrapping rock which gave him cause to move his long and slender external audio collectors around to triangulate on the source of the noise. ""Wheeljack, do you hear that?"" Turning to get a better bearing on what he was hearing, Gamma faced the out cropping. ""You either have better hearing than me, or you're just hearing things."" Was all Wheeljack retorted. ""No,"" Gamma was now whispering, ""I can actually hear it, from that pile of rocks."" Looking for his weapon, Gamma realized something else: his battle axe wasn't the only thing left behind on Cybertron, his rail-gun must be there as well. ""Aww, glitch bats!""</lj-cut>

<strong>Summary of Installment:</strong> Task'r-Seven is caught daydreaming before extraction operations are about to start, while the Autobot underground resistance monitors the Decepticon activities above and relays the news to Earth.

<lj-cut text=""Quit Dreaming and Get On the Beam!"">
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

""You, Task'r, stand guard near the control panel and quit day dreaming!"" Shockwave finally got Task'r-Seven's attention, practically shouting the order, ""You'd be an easy target for any Autobot by just standing there, and a sure one for Decepticon target practice!""
""Are you sure you need me to stay, looks like...""
""Are you questioning orders, young Decepticon? You won't get far in Megatron's quest for domination if your attitude persists... if you last that long!"" Shockwave had prior discipline problems with Task'r before today, this episode being just the latest. ""Just do as you're told!"" Task'r could only manage a meek ""Yes sir."" before assuming his ordered task.

""Alright everyone,"" Shockwave resuming to the task at hand, ""let us get this piece of scrap out of here, and careful about it less we find out personally the yield this thing will self-destruct at."" At that order, two smaller and nearly identical Decepticons carefully approached the axe, and took positions at either end: one towards the axe-head itself, while the other at the handle. The right arms of both Decepticons were tractor-beam emitters, aimed and ready to levitate the object in question. ""No, no, you two,"" Shockwave immediately saw an error in the positioning of the two robots, ""reposition yourselves to the top of the axe: you will be concentrating the tractors to the heavier axe-head itself: any residue energy will carry along to the handle itself."" This is the kind of quality that had given Megatron reason to entrust Cybertron into Shockwave's care in the first place: complete competence in one's tasks, and getting them done right the first time. 

After the robots shrugged and repositioned themselves, order was given to energize the emitters at a low power setting. This was barely enough to get the axe off the ground, plus the weapon was starting to move dangerously towards the robots. Shockwave had figured out that something like that would happen, so he ordered the beams to shut off so that a third robot can take a position at the handle to contribute a stabilizing third beam. This tactic turned out to be the most workable yet, as the axe was now properly suspended within the three beams that were working with and against each other. On Shockwave's cue, the Decepticon who was towing the transport trailer transformed, and took position at the stasis cube's control panel. 

Satisfied with the results so far, Shockwave ordered another tractor beam wielding robot to stand on the opposite side of the cube, ready to guide the weapon into the chamber itself, while the chamber operator was at the ready to activate the stasis emitters, and to make any dimensional adjustments to the actual trailer itself, to keep this object well within the confines of the chamber.

While the Decepticons were hard at work, a hidden camera was watching every move they make, and deep inside a hidden location within Cybertron, a video screen showing all action up on the surface. Without hesitation, a feminine voice starts to give out orders: ""Bluestar, stop watching that human game on your monitor for a moment and open up a secure comm-link to Optimus Prime's base on Earth: the Decepticons have found Gamma's axe!""
""Yes ma'am!"" responded a younger feminine voice, then softly, ""Don't do fade-away shots LeBron!""
""Right now Blue!""
""Yes Elita, the comm channel is open now!""


'If it wasn't for those smoke grenades, I'd have seen Gamma's improved hand to hand combat skills.' thought Optimus when he observed what went on, 'He learned more on K'Veht than just harmonic structures and scale temperaments that's for certain.' Turning to the assembled Autobots, the big truck was reluctant to give the order, but had to anyway, less nothing got done that day, ""Alright everyone, looks like the show is over: back to posts!"" After the collective groans of disappointment subsided, and everyone who had something else to do returned to their activities, Optimus turned back to Tele-Tran's screen to observe that both Wheeljack and Gamma had gone back to the task of doing the repairs to the sensor arrays. He overheard a discussion between Gamma and Wheeljack: ""The B'Suhl order eh, what's the graduation ritual, snatching a pebble from Master Po's hand or something?"" 
""What?"" 
""Never mind then, here's the problem I was having with this antenna mast when you got here..."" At that, letting out a slight chuckle to himself, Optimus was about to turn to leave the control room when Tele-Tran announced an incoming transmission from Cybertron.</lj-cut>"

*********************************************

[Memory File:235571EA: ACESSED, begin playback now...]
Gamma was frantically weaving through heavy traffic during a Cybertronian afternoon, trying to get to Epsilon's workshop/rehearsal space when the group's low frequency expert hadn't shown up with the others to get ready for that evening's performance. This was a very important recital for all five members of the group, as this was their debut, and Gamma was dead sure this opportunity wasn't going to be blown due to another's laze-faire attitude. 'I hope he didn't develop cold brake shoes, I'll pull his plug if he did!' The only time Epsilon missed anything group related, was when he was in repair bay after getting side-swiped by a young energon warehouse worker eager to report in to duty for the first time, Orion Pax. That first run-in with the very remorseful transport turned out to be a lasting friendship between Orion, and the two musicians. Epsilon had personally invited Orion to attend, with seating for three up close to the venue's stage in case he wanted to bring someone else with him.

When Gamma finally arrived at his destination, he quickly transformed back to robot mode, and was simultaneously banging his fist on the front entrance, while pushing the button to activate the door buzzer. ""For Matrix sake, open up Epsilon! The others are already at the venue, and are setting up as I speak!"" Milli-moments later, latches and sound-proofing sub-systems disengaged from the entrance, and the pocket door slid open to allow Gamma to enter his missing band mate's abode. Inside it was large enough to be sectioned-off into areas more suited to various tasks: the most largest area was where the group held their rehearsals, and where the larger equipment that couldn't be readily carried, like Gamma's or Epsilon's main musical interfaces could be, set-up and ready for the next practice/writing session. Today it was about as bare as can be; all that gear was transported already by two of the other members earlier in the day, but Gamma was at his regular duty post at a chemical research facility, so he couldn't lend a hand. Silent-Wing the singer, was an aircraft and a glider at that, so she couldn't help with hauling the equipment until it arrived. That only left Epsilon to explain why he wasn't helping to get ready for the performance.

It didn't take any time to find Epsilon, as he was seen working on an instrument in a well stocked, but cluttered work area, off to Gamma's right in relation to the practice area. ""The others said you'd be joining us later, but I figured you would be having second thoughts about tonight's performance, Epi. So what is the deal?"" 
""I will, I will. I'm just doing some repairs and adjustments to my interface, I have found the problem with that operator that was making the static noise when I make a real time change on the resonant filter."" Epsilon said without looking up. ""Besides Gee, I'm not the type to willfully want to blow our chance: I want it that badly too.""
""That's good to hear on both fronts,"" Gamma was greatly relieved at the news, ""so, any chance still on my idea for the show?""
""What? I thought the group vote closed that subject already!"" That got Epsilon's undivided attention, looking up from his repair job, ""What kind of crazy idea is that: setting off low-grade pyro during the gig? No group would be serious to do something weird like that: too distracting!""
""But Epi, it would be a great idea if the others would only give it a chance.""
""Brother, the answer is still for this moment: No! You should come up with a practical use for your pyro experiments anyway.""
""Besides,"" Epsilon added, returning to his repair work, ""Those types who perform music without a visible instrument interface would need that type of show-off thing to make up for never learning to play an instrument in the first place."" 
[Memory File:235571EA: Paused.]
------------------------------------

""...Have you been listening? I just demanded why you are here on Earth, What is your answer!"" Wheeljack was getting a bit impatient with the lack of response he was now getting from his subject, who seemed to be coming up with responses too slowly for his ""prisoner's"" own good.
""I received the relayed message that Prime and you guys were now stationed here, so I cut short my studies where I was hiding for the last three hundred orbits to come here."" Gamma finally responded, re-realizing his current situation, ""I decided to visit the others on Cybertron en route to catch up on our collective situation against our enemy, when the welcoming party and I were attacked.""
""Likely story: You were sent by Megatron to spy on us. Getting damaged is the kind of ruse he'd use to get through our defenses!"" Wheeljack was playing his part perfectly, maybe a little too perfectly as he leveled his weapon at the back of his prisoner's head. ""I want the truth, Decepticon, and make it quicker this time!"" Unseen by Wheeljack, small panels slid open in Gamma's wrists and silvery orbs were deposited into Gamma's hand assemblies, ready to be deployed. Gamma remained stoic, 'He should have ordered me to keep my hands in his constant view.' was his only thought before he acted.

While all this was going on, a hidden security camera was relaying all that was happening between Wheeljack and Gamma, right to the main screen of Tele-Tran One where a small audience had gathered to watched in amusement, all except for one young member of Earth's indigenous life form.

""Optimus, who is that brown robot Wheeljack just captured, and why is everyone having a good laugh over it?"" Asked the young human.
""That, Spike, is an old friend of mine from before the war. He was one of first ones who joined in the cause after Megatron first attacked the Autobots."" Was Prime's response, ""We're only doing this to ""practical joke a practical joker"" and to welcome him here in same order.""
""Oh,... what kind of practical jokes did he do?""
""Target specific kinds of things: making objects shatter, disappear, melt or detonate when a target Autobot of his silliness would touch the object...""
""You mean... explode?!"" Spike was a bit shocked, and taken-back by that last one.
Optimus was reassuring, ""Nothing damaging, I can assure you, just strong enough to startle his victim. He'd save the higher yield explosives against the Decepticons. He's still the best at what he does, and I'm personally glad he has rejoined us, as I feared we'd never see him again.""

Spike was about to ask a question about Gamma's notably caprine features when a couple small explosions filled Tele-Tran's main screen, showing nothing but a thick, blackish-blue smoke. Sounds of a brief scuffle were overheard over the comm-link, but no weapons fire. That wasn't reassuring to some of the Autobots, who were raring to go to Wheeljack's aid if need be. ""Everyone, stand-by and wait!"" was the only command Optimus needed to give to the others, he's seen this tactic before from Gamma. When the smoke finally dissipated enough, Wheeljack was seen flat on his back, while Gamma was in a semi-crouch position, pointing his victim's own weapon back upon his defeated opponent. ""Young Autobot,"" Gamma spoke calmly, ""if I were truly Decepticon, you wouldn't be functional right now: this laser cannon would have been discharged before you even made that patch of dirt your landing pad!""

""The last time I saw you do that, it wasn't so quick like this time."" Wheeljack had managed to prop himself up with his elbow sub-assemblies so to look at his opponent, waiting for his internal gyros to re-calibrate themselves. ""Where did you learn to move that quickly?""
""I spent considerable time at a monastery on the planet K'Veht, almost three hundred and fifteen of their orbits on that world in total in fact,"" Gamma was now lending a hand to help Wheeljack back up, weapon pointed towards the ground. ""Very nice people: though a bit wary of strangers at first, but they warm up to you once they know that one is not a threat. One learns a lot from the population of a host world.""
""As we are finding out here,"" Wheeljack was now back on his own feet, checking for any damage, ""dealing with the humans of this planet: a very diverse bunch here, still warring amongst themselves.""
""Are they native to this world?""
""Yes, most likely.""
Disappointed, Gamma concluded: ""Then they don't know what it is like to lose one's own planet of origin due to such fighting, let's hope they don't learn the hard way.""

	'If I wasn't such a patient mech, I'd be getting plenty perturbed by now.' Task'r was calculating to himself, main weapon at ready, 'But what I am getting, is maddeningly bored with all this waiting for one of those tailpipe kissers to get this Autobot garbage out of here.' While wandering around the secure area, Task'r was thinking of anything he can to pass time: Pi, why he had the rotten luck of first-boot as a Decepticon in the first place, the axe, most of his closest allies getting destroyed either in battle or by whim of the hierarchy's hair-trigger temperament. What his thoughts usually thread to, was escape: escaping all this war and dominance over others, and just wander somewhere, forgetting what faction he is part off. His thought-thread then ended up pondering a legend of the only Decepticon who dared to  strongly question Megatron's drive to dominate everything, and lived; exiled somewhere, maybe still functional to this day, somewhere. 
	
""That took parts made of heavy alloys!"" Task'r finally spoke aloud when he heard a rumbling from a distant position north-west of his position. ""About fscking time! What did they do, take the scenic route?"" When Task'r noted the shear size of the team: thirteen Decepticons in all, including Shockwave approaching the area, Task'r was even more perplexed. 'All that for a piece of Autobot trash? It can't be that polluting!' Before even the last consonants were even processed, six Seeker-based Decepticons had landed, transformed, and established a security parameter around the area, weapons drawn. The six other D-Cons were land based, but one of them was towing what looked like a sparse, open air cube with four wheels. On the side that was on the opposite end of the hitch, a podium type of protuberance jutted out away, and then up to be the cube's control surface. In each corner of the cube, pointed towards the center, were field generators/projectors ready to keep their cargo safely centered in stasis suspension during the haul to wherever it will be taken.</lj-cut>"

	""You! Halt and identify!"" Wheeljack took a defensive pose, sidearm drawn, when the brown Pontiac was twenty five yards away. There was still enough loose dirt on the hard pan to raise a sizable cloud of dust when the large coupe tried to come to a sudden stop, wheels panic-locked uselessly to avoid any skidding.
'No anti-lock, shame.' Calculated  Wheeljack, 'I'll see if I can retro-fit a system, he can use such, unless its a panic lock.' ""Alright you, show me who you are!"" Quickly getting back into character, Wheeljack barked out.
""Wheeljack! What is the meaning of this?"" Demanded Gamma while still in vehicle mode.
""Transform, and be quiet unless you are answering my questions... And no funny moves, less I blast you!"" Wheeljack was really enjoying this, this situation was reminding him of all those westerns Spike and Sparkplug suggested to him to watch.
""But Wheeljack, it is me, Gamma Antares! Prime sent me to...""
""Shut up and transform, NOW!""
	
""Alright, as you say."" When Gamma transformed out of vehicle mode, Wheeljack couldn't believe his optics, before him was a bipedal robot that resembled a billy goat: audio collectors shaped like erect ears, horns, beard and all!
'And not even a GTO, it would have been appropriate!' was the first thread that went through Wheeljack's cranial chamber, ""Alright you, first off, you don't even look like any Autobot I know. Second: where's your axe if you are who you claim?""
""Lost back on Cybertron, when I was ambushed."" Answered the brown robo-goat to the second question, he felt that he already answered the first one enough as it was. 
""Like I'm going to believe that, I know for a fact that the real Gamma wouldn't let it out of his optical range, to the point of having a transmitter installed if such does happen: where is it exactly!""
""I'm out of it's range, it has only a short range signal. I-I never thought I'd ever be that far from it."" If there was any possibility of a robot to be nervous, Gamma was proving it at that moment. With due care, Wheeljack side-stepped around to the back of the strange looking brown robot, careful as to keep him in constant optical range. 'Never can tell what this joker will do next.' Wheeljack's next question was more personal: ""So tell me 'Gamma Antares', who's your brother?""

""Epsilon was my brother..."""

These are the postings of mere <em><u>pretenders</u></em>! Humans who after too many viewings of the <strong>Transformers</strong> movie, actually believe they are the individuals they believe they are, acting in manners that are 100% unlike the members of said factions I've fought along side and against for these millions of years.

Hillary with new faceplate/ cranial chamber due to possible malfunctioning of repair chamber. First assignment: help Wheeljack outside with repairs to sensor arrays near top of volcano. Back on Cybertron, Gamma's&nbsp; lost battle axe is discovered by a routine Decepticon security patrol. Meanwhile Wheeljack is informed that the approaching car is the recently repaired Gamma, and is ordered by Prime to pull a practical stunt on the recent arrival, with every action about to be shown on Tele-Tran's main screen...  <br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Summary of Installment:</b> Task'r-Seven reports his finding, news gets to Megatron via Shockwave.<br />Other:</span> New icon (Front clip of Gamma's Alt-mode, but in silver [couldn't find one in brown.])<br /><br />=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=---=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br /><br /><lj-cut>""Whatever you do Task'r, do not, and I repeat do not touch anything until I send support!"" The voice of Shockwave over the comm-link was stern and urgent, ""If that axe belongs to whom I compute it does by your description, it is booby-trapped against Decepticon use.""<br />""Rriigghhtt, like I'm going to blow-up or something."" Task'r retorted, ""What Auto-nitwit would be smart enough to implement something like that, and then lose track of it in battle?""<br />""You'd be surprised,"" Shockwave returned, ""don't underestimate Autobot cleverness at all: I've seen what a prior weapon as this can do: it wasn't pretty. I'll be contacting Megatron about this, he'll be more than interested of what will be found about it when I probe it's construction.""<br />""Just as well then, I'll comply with you orders... for now."" Resigned Task'r, knowing full well that sometimes arguing with Shockwave was about as fruitful as debating a bulkhead, and just as amusing without the use of brute force. After signing-off the comm-link, Task'r happened to glance at the axe. Curiosity was in conflict with his sub-routines that demanded that he obey his orders to not even touch the battle axe. ""What is it about this thing, other than being on the receiving end of one of its strikes?""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""You don't say! Was Gamma destroyed in battle?"" Was Megatron's first questions when Shockwave relayed the report of the ambush.<br />""From reports I've received from those involved, Gamma sustained heavy damage, mainly to his faceplate, but not enough to cease function.""<br />""Only that? Those incompetents can't get anything right!"" Megatron was angered with the disappointing detail of his warriors' failure to finish the job. ""What is his status now?"" There was an almost uncharacteristic&nbsp; urgency in Megatron's demand for more data.<br />""Unknown, but shortly after, an Autobot transport was detected leaving Cybertron going away from Earth's location before going into hyperspace; too quickly in fact to engage pursuit.""<br />""FOOL, You could have intercepted them if they diverted to Earth anyway! By now Gamma Antares could be repaired and swapping war stories with Optimus Prime.""

Megatron was interested now, seeing that even though Gamma Antares might still have function, the secrets of the battle axe he uses may be revealed, and nullified... finally! ""Where is it now?"" <br />""Right where it was found, and I have posted the underling who discovered it to guard the weapon until I send a task force to retrieve it for study.""<br />""Good, will you be analyzing it there?""<br />""No, mighty one, we'll be transporting it to a secure facility...""<br />""Shockwave, how do you propose to transport the axe without setting-off its self-destruct subroutines?""<br />""We'll be using a combination of tractor beams and stasis fields to avoid physical contact.""<br />""Good, it just might work. Keep me updated on your progress, Megatron out."" Turning to Soundwave who was standing nearby while the Decepticon leader was conversing to Shockwave,&nbsp; ""Looks like I will be sending Laserbeak on a little&nbsp; mission...""</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Practical joke a practical joker? Not on my shift!"">Wheeljack had spent most of the day doing badly needed repairs and upgrades to the massive sensor arrays located near the peak of the volcano the ship carrying both the Autobots and Decepticons crashed into four million years before. How both factions managed to survive such a crash, while ironically during the heat of battle, can only be credited to Tele-Tran One. Even though Tele-Tran was heavily damaged in the crash, it was intact enough to start repairs when a burst of geo-thermal energy was enough to reactivate the then dormant computer system. Mistaking the native Terran machinery as the dominate life form, Tele-Tran would then repair and reactivate all aboard based on what information gleaned of the data the probes found, and the capabilities and size of the individual robot to be revived based on the closest Earth approximation. But that was Earth years ago, and before the most recent Decepticon attack rendering Tele-Tran unable to remain the central data point the Autobot faction relied upon to keep tabs of events, both of the enemy as well as the actions of the indigenous occupants of the host planet they are currently on.

	""Come on, fit in already!"" There had to be that one antenna placement that has to be the most difficult to deal with, even by robotic standards. It's mounting flange wasn't fabricated correctly, resulting in the bolts not going through one of the holes: the bolts diameter was slightly too big. ""I'm going to have to find out who fabricated this flange, and remind them to follow the plans exactly!"" Wheeljack's thread of thought was interrupted by the sound of an approaching car on the only access road to the base's sensor platform. ""An early to mid 1970's A-body Pontiac by the look and sound of it,"" Wheeljack quickly concluded after consulting his internal database of every Terran road machine ever made, ""but it doesn't look exactly like a Le Mans or even a GTO, not even close. I wonder if they need directions, must be lost if they ended up here."" At that moment, Wheeljack's link to the base below came online. ""Wheeljack, I've sent Gamma Antares to assist you on your activities up there.""
'Gamma? So that's who this guy is.' was the first mental reaction Wheeljack had about the news, his own run-ins with the Autobot were few, but enough to let him know that at times Gamma can be quite the character; situation permitting. ""Is that why there was a transport shuttle from Cybertron earlier, Prime?""
""Yes,"" was Prime's response, ""he was ambushed while on way to rendezvous with Elita-One and the others in our underground ops back on Cybertron. He was too badly damaged to be repaired there, so he was emergency transported here. He was changed a bit in the process.""
""As I can see, he's taken on a vehicle mode type I don't recognize as of yet. Mind if I interrogate him a bit?""
""Just don't get too extreme!"" Cautioned Prime.
""Alright, but I'll keep the comm-link open on this end.""
""And I'll gather everyone around Tele-Tran!"" Optimus Prime was about to witness, a practical joke about to be played on a known practical joker.</lj-cut>

"event","<lj-cut text=""Oh look, something is blinking!"">	Task'r-Seven really didn't like taking orders from anyone, especially from that sycophant Megatron put in charge of operations on Cybertron, Shockwave. In fact, Task'r didn't like Megatron at all either, from the few times he's dealt with the Decepticon leader personally: he's seen close allies as well as production mates get blasted to slag whenever the leader's temper levels goes violent, and needs to vent on the nearest  and most unsuspecting target available. How he managed to stay out of range of that particle accelerator's business end was something he didn't care to calculate, he just considered himself fortunate that he never did find out. 
	
The Decepticon medium-altitude security hover was doing a very routine security sweep near an old Autobot fortification, making note if any in his opinion, foolish members of Autobot underground resistance that might make an appearance. He heard that there was an ambush earlier in his scan area, where an older Autobot was badly damaged in the attack and ensuing battle. He wasn't in the area at the time to be a participant: a constant source of frustration to him. ""How come I always seem to miss all the fun,"" he calculated to himself, ""it would be more enjoyable than this drudgery."" At that moment his visual sensor arrays detected a faint, yet discernible tracking beacon flashing on the ground below, there weren't any tall structure that needed such warning lights to indicate that a structure was in the way, especially at ground level.
 	
Cautiously, he lowered himself to an altitude over the source of the mysterious light to get better scan of what is attracting his attention, and determine if it is worth reporting back to Decepticon HQ about. When his altitude got to about 12 meters by Earth measurement, Task'r's optical scanners with help of his searchlight, were able to make out a battle axe shape, among the debris of the recent battle ground. ""Interesting, but why would an axe need a flashing beacon?"" His scan then detected what he also suspected: an Autobot logo on the very end of the handle. ""Autobot, alright! Any wonder those fools need flashing lights on their weapons, they always lose track of them."""

Might as well reveal what the big ol' mystery is about...
<lj-cut text=""Pix-heavy LJ-Cut"">On Saturday I picked-up my order from TFSource.com:
<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/jim_ghote/pic/00027qx4"" alt=""The box itself"" width=""640"" height=""480"" align=""Middle""> 
I had to take it with me to work that day, the boss' wife thought I was buying pr0n online! I finally had to reveal to her that it was a cartoon box set. : /

<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/jim_ghote/pic/00028p0e"" alt=""Packing Peanuts[no yumzone]"" width=""640"" height=""480"" align=""Middle"">
A nicely packed box I do say myself.

<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/jim_ghote/pic/00029t7f"" alt=""One Layer down, ? to go..."" width=""640"" height=""480"" align=""Middle"">
Now we're getting somewhere! I now have the seal that is on top of this box on my current monitor, I was that careful in removing it.

<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/jim_ghote/pic/0002af5r"" alt=""Box O' Steel[TM]"" width=""640"" height=""480"" align=""Middle"">
What a lovely steel box that holds within everything that is G-1 robo-goodness, but what does it contain?

<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/jim_ghote/pic/0002bg42"" alt=""Key Fob of the Good Guys"" width=""640"" height=""480"" align=""Middle"">
You think I'm gonna use it?
Nope, its going to be kept in the tin box itself, prolly forever.
I'm just surprised that a D-Con fob wasn't included as well. 

<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/jim_ghote/pic/0002c28c"" alt=""Wait, there's more!"" width=""640"" height=""480"" align=""Middle"">
L~R:
Promo card for the movie/game, envolope of postcards (never to be used), *The Main Item*

<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/jim_ghote/pic/0002dyw1"" alt=""Has Japanese?"" width=""640"" height=""480"" align=""Middle"">
Majority of text within is in Japanese. Each ""page"" contains its own DVD of the G-1 era American series. Animated movie is included. Also a break-down of both sides' personnel that was around before the animated movie.

<img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/jim_ghote/pic/0002eby8"" alt=""Disc #1"" width=""640"" height=""480"" align=""Middle"">
On this DVD, it shows these things:
Lightly goes over the digi-restore process of the original broadcast masters. Points out such things as handling errors, missing details that couldn't be corrected. A-B's via side by side, examples of unrestored and restored footage.
A nauseating loop of ""bumper"" footage.
Some small peeks at the Japanese version... ""Starsabre""?! Great, now I'll have to re-word a bit of the story from Task'r's perspective to avoid using this mention, I thought ""Starsabre"" wasn't already used. Just Ducky! [grump]

And prolly lastly, some footage from Bot-Con '05 with interveiws. </lj-cut>

Well things are getting better. I got a job a a brand new restaurant that hasn't opened yet. I will start out waitressing and make my way on the bar. I am so excited. The kids are doing great. Alyssa's birthday is comming so fast, I can't believe shes going to be 5. My mom is living back down here, and I am so happy. She is going to be such a big help to me with the kids. It's just great to have your mom right down the road, instead of a 16 hour drive. My older brother is having some bad probelms in life it makes me upset and I widh he was able to be around family, but I guess he kind of has his own family, and him and his girl are going threw it together. Well I guess thats all!!!!"

"event","Wow, its been forever since I updated, probably because I havent been home much, been spending time with Alex a lot, staying at his place. So, anyway, I'm 19 now. Exciting, I guess, sure... Same old same old. It was awesome seeing Chels and Sean and Stevies for my birthday. I missed them so much. We pretty much hung out the Saturday before my bday at my place, went out to dinner, and spent time together. Just talking with them and being with them was so amazing. They mean so much to me, couldnt ask for better friends. On my actual birthday, Alex finally met my family, we all went out to dinner to Olive Garden, all 10 of us, it was fun. Everyone liked him, which is good. Jessica got a little buzzed from wine, which made the night amusing, especially playing Imaginiff. Overall, it was an awesome night. Alex is so amazing, he got me a gorgeous heart necklace for my birthday, I absolutely love it and him. I'm so happy. Everytime I'm with him, time just flies by, but it feels like we've been together for so much longer than 2 months. I love being with him. Whenever I'm not with him, I miss him. I spend more time at his place than my own. On another note, I'm still sick, damnit. It sucks. I hate being sick, but I dont wanna go to the doctor, even though I know I should. Thats pretty much all I've been up to, spending time with Alex, being sick, working, and school. Work is fucking lame as hell lately. I work with all new people cause so many people left and my boss pisses me off all the time. I'm seriously thinking about transfering to a different division, make more money and have a different boss. School, thankfully, is over. So glad that the semester is done. I think I did pretty well overall. Got a B+ in my art class that I barely even went to, the instructor told me I'm a very talented natural artist and I should continue taking art classes. Hell yea, bitches, what now mr fox! haha. On a different note, Christmas is right around the corner, it just snuck up on me this year. I'm so not ready, I havent even started shopping, even worse, I have no idea what to get anyone! I'm screwed. Going to the mall tomorrow to hopefully find something for everyone. Wish me luck :/"

"event","Life has been ... interesting... the past few weeks. Been sick, still. Pain in the neck, literally. Damn, I hate being sick. I think its finally going away though, which is nice. Last week at work, my back started hurting really bad. I was close to crying, could barely walk, it was so painful. Just sharp pain stabbing over my tense tightened back. Thankfully, I had Alex there. He was so comforting, just being there. I could tell he was sincerely concerned about me, which is extremely sweet. He gave me painkillers, Serbian painkillers, which helped a bit. Eventually the pain went away, but Alex was still there, to hold me, comfort me. Thats where I always want to be, in his arms, safe, protected. Being with him makes time zoom by, turning hours into minutes, days into hours. Its never enough, I want more time with him, don't even have to be doing anything, just being around him, seeing his smile, hearing his laugh, watching his eyes, running my fingers through his hair. He means so much more to me than I ever imagined. Our relationship took a leap into serious and I love it. In his arms is the best place in the world to be. I love it when he's hugging me and kisses my forehead. Its so sweet, so touching. That little notion, just to show he cares. Makes me smile everytime he does it. He makes me so happy. He has yet to meet my family, but hopefully that will change on Monday. Its my birthday and I'm taking the day off of work. Me and my family are going out to eat and if everything goes good, Alex will get the night off also. I really hope he does. It would be so awesome if he was there. I want to see him on my birthday, I want him to meet my family, I want to hear my parents say that they like him, that hes a good guy and they're happy for me. I'm sure they'll like him, how could they not? Its just hard to believe its my birthday already, life is flying by. The semester is almost over and I have so much work left to do. Time to register for next semester, I don't know what I want to take. Need to look through the list of classes I have to take and just pick a couple and get them over with. Theres an animation class I want to take, but its only at night, so I'd have to take days off of work. I'm sure Birant will love that I'm changing my availability, but whatever. He never wants to give me days off, always gives me a hard time about it, I never see him bother anyone else about requesting days. I don't think he likes me much, but who cares. I work my ass off at that place, more than I should, more than I get paid for. I think I might look for a new job. This one isnt paying very well and it so frustrating every single day. Its not worth it anymore. The fun part of working there, flirting with Alex, is gone. We hardly ever get to work together and plus hes transfering next week to a different division. So I'll get to see him even less. But I'll miss him more, making the time I do get to be with him that much better, that much more special and amazing."

"event","So things have been going ok lately, I guess. Been sick the past few days which sucks. I hate being sick. I keep taking medicine and vitamins and stuff, but it hasn't gone away yet. :(
On a better note, I'm dating Alex, haven't actually wrote that in here yet. Hes an amazing guy. I love that he can make me laugh and that I trust him. Plus, hes very hot, always a bonus. I have such a good time with him. He's a really sweet guy, when he wants to be, but jokes around and is fun also. I care about him a lot. On the surface, we seem so different, but we're really not. We have a lot in common, we think alike. He's gonna be transfering to another part of Cashman soon, so that means we won't work together anymore. Alex says that this will be a good thing and help our relationship and I believe him, but its gonna suck not seeing him at work everyday. 
On the topic of work, I told Birant that I needed Wednesday off next week for my brother's birthday and he was all like 'I'll see what I can do, no guarantees' Fucker. We have plenty of people that can work that night. And plus, its so slow now that we don't even need all the people that he schedules. If he doesn't give me that day off, I don't care, I'm not working on my little brother's 11th birthday. I can work any day, but Dylan is only going to turn 11 once and I wanna be there. What is he gonna do? Fire me? haha, yea right. 
On a happier note, again, 17 days until my bday :D"

Was it really that long ago? Graduated 5 months ago, I can't believe its been that long and what do I have to show for it? nothing. I'm just getting by. Taking the minimum amount of classes I need to in college, so different from a few months ago when I was taking the maximum I could at a-tech just for the hell of it. 2006 is zooming by. Less than a month away, I'll be 19. Didn't I just turn 18? Doesn't seem that long ago. New Years wasn't almost a year ago, even though for some strange reason I can not remember what the fuck I did on New Years. See, this is why I don't drink. I can't remember shit while I'm sober. Imagine how little I would remember if I was drunk? If anyone knows what I did on New Years, please tell me, Its so frustrating to not remember. Time is flying by, but am I ready for it to?
Oh yea, and that song up ^^^ Wish I could forget you by Silverstein is so awesome. I love the violin in that song. Its so beautiful. <3"

"event","I was sitting at my computer, typing up my outline for my speech on BASE jumping that I'm giving on Tuesday and I glance over at my open closet door and something catches my eye. My violin case, sitting at the bottom of my closet, lonely, untouched in who knows how long. I've probably played a few times since I quit at the end of my freshman year of high school, that was 4 years ago. Four long years of me not touching what used to be my most prized possession. So I grab the case and my bag of sheet music, forgetting about my outline. As I open the case, I smile. Its still there, my violin, sitting peacefully in its home, waiting all these years for me to bring it back out, let it do what it was made to do, make music. I gently pluck each string once. I can tell they are all slightly out of tune, a bit flat, but how much, I'm not sure. Its been too long since I've tuned my violin simply by ear. I'm proud that my ears could still tell the flatness was there. I put my shoulder rest on the instrument, still remembering which way it goes and pick up my bow. After I tighten and rosin it, my hand becomes one with the bow, holding it exactly as I was taught to so long ago, my fingers relaxed and gently curled over the bow. I position my violin in its familar spot, resting on my shoulder, held by my left cheek. I'm slightly surprised to find that my tuner still works and discover that I was right, all my strings were a little flat. I play a simple scale and smile as the notes echo in my otherwise silent room. I shuffle through my music, finding old songs I loved. I play piece after piece. Each song flows back into me, my fingers know what to do from memory without me realizing it. Song after song, memory after memory, regret after regret. Why did I quit? I missed playing my violin, didn't realize it, but I did. Eventually my fingertips start to numb from soreness, my jawbone aches. My body isn't used to playing, its been too long. Finally, I decide my fingers can't take anymore. One mistake after another. I gently put my violin and bow back into their oh-so-familar case with a joy knowing that its not going to be another 4 years before I pick it up again. I refuse to let myself lose that part of my past, which I loved so much."

"event","I'm sitting on an uncomfortable wooden bench in a dimly lit room. My usually silky soft hands are now rough, rougher than I would like, but I don't care. I've got paper cuts intricately tracing over my fingers and hands, light lines of momentary pain. My palms and the back of my fingers, especially on my right hand are a dark gray tint. My fingertips on both hands are black, completely pitch black. Covered, my hands are covered with darkness. My hair loosely falls in my face, but I don't dare brush it away, for I know that just one sweep of my hand is all it takes to make my face look like my fingers, covered. My eyes are straining to see details through the lack of good lighting and everytime I look, something looks different. It's frustrating, but I manage control, trying to focus on one thing at a time, not looking back nor forward. Classic rock echoes in the otherwise silent room, but I barely hear it. Instead all that fills my ears is my own breathing and the gentle brushing noise of charcoal on paper. My legs ache for movement, but I remain seating, barely moving at all. I know that if I moved I would not be able to find the exact spot again. If just glancing at the paper and back again changes my view, getting up and moving will alter the entire perspective, so I must be patient. After close to three hours, it is complete. As I sigh in accomplishment, I instantly sit up straighter, stretching my back, as it pops from my poor posture of the past hours. I smile at my drawing, feeling pride in myself, a rare feeling for me. At last I can get up and move, wash my hands, hear the music. It is almost surprising how pale my hands looked after washing away all the black charcoal. Now I notice dark smudges on my jeans and t-shirt, memories of a day, a drawing. I've fallen in love, its amazing to feel skilled, good, proud, to be complimented on something I created. I love drawing with charcoal, no matter how messy it may be."

"event","Alright, so I worked out what I was stressing over my last post. Thank you so much for listening and the advice, Chels. You rock, I miss you girl. Anyway, I talked with Ray about our relationship and pretty much we came to a mutual understanding that its not working right now, since we don't have the time to see each other from conflicting work/school schedules. Basically, we're taking a break. Maybe someday when our schedules work out better we will get back together, who knows. Its the future, what happens will happen, no one knows what the future holds. It was a peaceful ending, most peaceful I've ever had. I can already tell we're gonna stay friends, which is good.
On another note, Jessica, my sister, is turning 21 on Thursday. Its so exciting. I can't believe shes 21 already. We grew up so fast. 
RenFair is this weekend. Chels said that she and some other people are roadtripping down here. I can't wait to see them again. I miss them all so much. Too bad they're all going to the fair on Saturday and I have to work that night. Hopefully I can get up early enough to go with them for a few hours before work. Should be fun. 
Alright, didn't really have much to update, so thats it."

One choice is all it takes to resolve this confusion, but the confusion delays the decision, so I'm stuck, lost at sea again, drifting along with no direction because I'm scared to decide. Go with whats comfortable, secure, what I know, or take a chance on a new adventure, full of unknowns and mysteries? I don't know what to do and its hurting me. I don't want to hurt anyone, but just like always, I know I must. Theres no way out of this without someone hurting, myself or otherwise. Everyday things get more and more complicated. I need someone that isn't involved that I trust to give me some good honest advice, but alas, all my friends are gone off to college, starting their own lives. But I need them, hundreds of miles away, but I still need them. How selfish of me. Ugh, why do I always think of myself? I should be happy for my friends off in college despite how much I need them, their advice, support. I need help deciding. What is expected of me or what I want? Follow my mind or my heart? How do I choose? *tear*"

"event","Its funny how things work out. Haven't updated really in a long time, but after about 5 days of no internet, one of the first things I do is update, because I've been dying to update the entire time the internet was gone. Kind of ironic I think. Anyway, things have been interesting, kinda.
Wednesday night, I stayed up until about 5am working on my speech for class Thursday morning. I regret completely not working on it more during the week and hate my procrastination, but I did get it done. I got off work at about 10pm Wednesday night, went to Walmart to get some index cards and energy drinks for the long night of speech-preparing. I drank two redbulls that night while I was working on it and they kept me awake until I was finally finished, exhausted at 5am, when I decided to try for some sleep instead of just pulling an all-nighter. I got about an hour, maybe 2 of sleep before waking up to my alarm clock just to head off to class (drinking another redbull on the way to school). I was hella nervous giving my speech and it showed, but I presented my research, ended within the time limit and I think I did a pretty good job on it, I hope...
That afternoon (thurs), I was so worn out. My entire body was aching and I felt physically too weak to be able to do anything. I was scared to lie down, even though my body was telling me to, because I knew I would fall asleep and then I would be late for work. So I sucked it up, had another redbull on the way to work and made it through the tough night. By the end of the night, my legs, actually my whole body, was screaming in pain, it felt as if I had run 10 miles, but in reality I had just done what I do everyday, just with no rest. I slept like 12 hours that night and it was wonderful.
Work's been going alright. Got raised to $8 an hour instead of $7.50, not much, but with how slow winter will be, its gonna help. The guys I work with are so goofy sometimes, its fun. The other night, Alex snorted pop rocks, hilarious. I love it when crazy shit like that happens. When its quiet and nothing is going on, its so boring, especially when they stand around talking Serbian around me. Its like they don't want me in the conversation, even though there is no one else for me to talk to. 
I feel like I'm slipping away, drifting on with life with no direction, as if I'm floating in the middle of a lake on a tiny inner-tube. Land is visible in multiple directions, but which way to go? Which is closer, which will proof the most worthwhile, the most successful, which is best in the long-term, what about the short-term? So many choices, so many decisions and I'm lost, lost at sea, floating along, alone, scared to make a final decision. 
I hardly see people anymore. Well, I see people, but not my family, my friends, my boyfriend. I see strangers, hundreds of them everyday, tourists, families, in the same spot as me for a completely different reason, they seek enjoyment, I seek money. I see my coworkers more than anyone else, all what 5 people that work night shift for Cashman at Shark Reef on a regular basis. Barely see my family anymore or even talk to them. We're worlds apart under the same roof. Ray, well, we talk sometimes, see each other even less. Its hard, but I'm getting used to the idea that hes not there or I'm not there 99% of the time. And friends, well, what friends? I realize more and more everyday that I really don't have many (any) friends. Everyone's gone to college, but even before that, I didn't really talk to anyone like a close friendship. I'm more of the person that is casual friends, talk every once is while, maybe get together sometimes, but a few months down the road, its gone, loss of communication, moving on. I guess I just really suck at communicating and keeping in touch with people or maybe people just don't want to keep in touch with me, communicate with me, be friends with me. Whatever, either way, I'm alone, lost and alone."

"event","I used charcoal for the first time yesterday in Art 101 and I love it. I think I'm going to use charcoal a lot more now. Its hella messy, but looks awesome. I also how much easier it is to fill an area with a solid, unsmudged tone, with graphite it takes forever to get rid of the line look, but charcoal, there isn't lines. Art is a fun class, I've learned quite a bit so far. I am pretty good at drawing, when I actually see the object I'm drawing, instead of just imagining it. My portfolio is definitely going to have more hand-drawn pieces that it was missing before. 
Last night at work was alright. Teased and made fun of as usual. Don't they ever have anything positive to say about me? I don't see them tease anyone else as much as me. Sasa went somewhere at like 9:15ish and took Thomas's cell phone cause his was dead. The thing is, Sasa didn't come back for a long time. Me, Alex, and Thomas are chilling there wondering what the fuck is going on. He just felt us alone. I mean, I can understand him leaving us alone in the middle of the shift when theres not much going on, but to just leave right before we close? what kind of shit is that? Oh well, whatever. 
Other than, nothing exciting in my life. Rather boring."

"event","Lately I've been wondering if people really only see me the way they tease me. Like am I just a short, quiet, dirty-minded person or is there really more and do other people see that more? I think the people at work just like making fun of me, its seems like thats all they do sometimes. It kinda hurts. You get laughed at enough, it gets to you, eventually making you feel like shit. It doesn't take much to make me feel like shit. Everyday its the same thing. I know I'm short, not my fault, is it really something that I need to be made fun of everyday for the rest of my life? Or quiet? Or any of my other numerous faults? There's the saying 'as long as the positives outnumber the negatives', but I don't think they do. I have a lot more negatives than positives. Is that entirely my fault? probably, but its not like I did that on purpose. What can I do to change that? Why can't people accept me for who I am? Why am I the butt of every joke? But who really cares, I'm just another depressed emo teen, one of many, seems to be a trend these days almost. Maybe I'm bipolar, because I have really good days too. It seems random, my good and bad days. On good days, all the being made fun of in the world wouldn't affect my good mood, but today, on a bad day, the smallest bit drives me to isolation and depression. Why?"

"event","As I was finally starting to clean my room a bit today, I stumbled upon all the old college brochures and information I had saved from the past year. I stared at the RMCAD and Otis ones for a while, my two favorite schools, and sighed, throwing them into the trash with all the rest. I also found my Otis acceptance letter and with tears threatening to spill, also threw it away. I have to get that idea out of my head. No matter how wonderful the fantasy of going off to a fancy art school seems, I know I can't. I'm staying in Vegas, going to CCSN, probably going to find a different major, a new focus on my life and give up on being an artist. I could never do it. I don't have the drive, the talent, the ability to be an artist. All I have is dreams, fantasy. I haven't lifted a pencil and drawn anything since school let out and moving my sketch book from my desk, where it has lived for months, years maybe, into my closet where it belongs was just another symbol to me that its over. I can't live a dream. I have to face the facts. I'm not an artist. I'm horrible at drawing. I can visualize, but I have no way of expressing it and no drive, determination, desire to. All during high school, I was always the one completely sure of what I wanted to do, be a computer animator. Don't get me wrong, I still want to, but all the wanting in the world doesn't change the lack of ability. I've given up and I've never felt more lost. I have no idea what to do with the rest of my life."

"event","Omg, Haven't updated since like forever-ago. Not really, but whatev. Life has been going alright, ok fine, my life is good, great, awesome. My AP tests are almost over, just one more. I'm a little worried about what the fuck I'm doing next year, but its not the main focus of my life right now, I'm just like yea, whatever, ccsn ftw maybe. Anywho, AP tests, I think I did good on the Calculus one, except for the free-response. Those were hard and I forgot so much! The Lit test was hella long it seemed. The essays were gay. Enough said. Since I'm not supposed to take about the actual questions, I won't so ha. I can't believe school is almost over. It went by so fast. A little more than a month and I'm graduating. and after that, Mexico! woots. Surprisingly my grades are alright. Just need to keep it that way for one more month, just one... 
Work has been... well... work. Nothing too outstanding to report. Meetings, long nights and stuff. I like my job, the hours kinda suck, but well, one more month, right? The guys I work with are so funny. Yea, work is lame, moving on to something more interesting...
So Ray and I are going to Senior Prom together. Its gonna be fun. My dress is so fucking awesome, I love it. We're not sure what we're doing yet, but we'll figure it out. We're thinking about doing something after the dance, but what? Ray said something about doing something with Chris and Vanessa afterwards, who knows. I'll let him work that out, I have more important thigns to figure out, like shoes... please do not take that seriously... lol. 
Things are kind of odd right now. I'm not sure whats going to happen in the future. So many options, opportunities, choices. Its hard to tell what will have what effect in the long run, good and bad. I don't want to make a decision now, just to have my future be fucked, you know. I'm not sure what to do, but I should, I need to, I'm supposed to... 
Omfg, I almost got hit by a semitruck the other night on my way home from work, that was so fuckin scary. I was on the 15 North, getting on the ramp to the 95 North, when this semi decided he wanted to go on the 95 also, but was in the wrong lane, so he just got in my lane. Luckily there was no one in the lane next to me, cause I swerved over there to avoid the huge ass truck merging into me. Scary shit there, and my fear of death by semis grows *tear*
But I'm alive. And everything is awesome. And I have someone that cares about me and thats all that matters. Someone that cares enough to try and help me when everyone else sugar-coated and pretended nothing was wrong. Its amazing. The next few months is gonna be interesting and I'm up for it. Bring it on, biatch! ... ok, I'm not sure whos thats directed towards, I just felt like saying it, so STFU n00b!

"event","Wow, been a long time. Works been going good. I worked a 12 hour shift last Saturday, which sucked ass cause I was there the entire time Shark Reef was open, but I made hella good money, like $200. Kick ass. I told Oscar to pretty much lay off a little bit. I don't mind flirting with him, but sometimes he goes too far and um, no, not happening. We had a meeting the other day at the main office and yea, that was a fun experience. First, I was already late cause of traffic, so I called Kevin to tell him that I was running late and right when I got off the phone with him, my gas light went on, so I was like ""Shit"" and got off at Sahara to find a gas station, which was harder than I thought. Its like most of the time, theres a gas station at like every freeway exit, except downtown! Ugh. So I found one and got gas and omg, I was lost. So I finally figured out how to get there and was like 30min late. Lame ass. But Alex came in later than me, haha, sucka. not really. Theres another meeting on Friday, yay... Mr Cashman isnt exactly the friendliest person in the world. :(
School is going alright, stressed, but the AP tests are coming up soon, so its almost over. I've decided that I'm not moving to California to go to Otis next year. My parents and I are gonna go check out the Art Institute of Las Vegas soon, so hopefully I can go there, or else its gonna be CCSN and basic classes for a few years, which is cool. Means I can stay at Cashman Photography. Deal with one thing at a time and well other benefits of staying home...
Anywho, the other night, my parents heated up the spa and it was really nice to sit there and relax, forget about everything else. Somehow my dad got talking about renewing his pilot's license and I said I wanted to get one. I think that my parents thought that meant I want to be a pilot, but I don't, I just want to fly... become an animator that flies in my free time, for fun. I wanna do the flips and spins and shit. That'd be fun, something to look forward to, getting my pilot's license. :D
So Ray and I went to go get our passports yesterday so we can go to Mexico this summer. My picture was kinda lame looking, but I was at least smiling, so I win. Ray was grumpy, haha. Took a long time, but its done and I'm so excited about going to Mexico, its gonna be awesome. It was nice to spend time with Ray again. I don't really see him much anymore. We did a lot of talking, goofing off and stuff. It was awesome. 
I still have like hardly any free time, which sucks, but pretty soon that will change, summer will be here and all will be good. Theres just a lot going on before I get that far. Everyday is a new experience. I recently fell into the trap of everyday running into every other one. I need to break out of that, do something random, exciting, fun every once in a while. Well, I think I'll wait until after the AP tests and then try being random. ^_^

"event","Been a while, dang. Haven't updated since I started at Cashman. So I'll start there! Its so much fun, I love it. My first day I worked morning, so it was really busy and went by fast, but I've been working nights ever since. Night shift is fun cause its slow and crazy shit happens. I'm also the only girl that works night shift, so its interesting. Luis calls me 'baby' and *protects* me from the other guys, so I tell him they're being mean and he gives them an angry look, its funny, cause hes like the same height as me and would probably lose in a fight with the other guys. Thomas is awesome. Hes an art student at unlv, painter, and left-handed too. I dunno why I'm amused by that, but I am. Hes like 20 and his gf just left him for another guy she met in Peurto Rico. I feel bad for him, especially when I see him working on the belt hes making her for her bday. Hes funny though. Blake is kind of annoying, but hes an alright guy, hes only like 17 and had a huge crush on Melinda, who worked for Shark Reef and is like 22ish, but she left, so hes like sad, but not really cause he just flirts with the other Shark Reef girls anyways. Its amusing cause it was so obvious Melinda didnt like him (I could see it and I've known them like a week!). Lets see, Alex (Aleksander) is cool, but not so talkative. First thing I thought about when I saw him, was 'damn, he's rather hot', but well, not getting involved with coworkers and I barely know him. He usually works on the other side, so I dont see him much, which means not much chance to get to know him, but whatev. Oscar is kinda good-looking also, I'll admit it. I think hes 19 or 20, not sure. Hes fun. He jokes with me and is an interesting person. The night managers are Milan and Sasa, they're cool, I guess. So pretty much, theres 5 jobs we can do: greeting, posing, scanning, shooting, and selling. I like greeting late at night, when theres like no one there cause you don't really need to stop them when there was no one in front of them, so you dont do much. 
Last night at work was hilarious. Oscar and Thomas blew up a rubber gloves enough to make it look kinda like a hand and colored it black with a marker and was messing around with it. Like pulling their arm up and pretending it was their real hand, randomly putting it in customers pics (without them knowing) and leaving it on the ground and telling guests they dropped something. It amused us for a good hour or so. Oscar was totally hitting on me like all night, but I didn't really realize it at first cause they all joke with me and use me as an armrest and lean on me, etc. It wasn't until he gave me his number that I realized something was actually going on. So, me, Thomas, Oscar, and Luis all got off at about the same time and walked out together. It was fun. While we were walking, Oscar kept putting his arm around me, Thomas kept tripping me and Luis kept holding my hand and skipping. It was kinda weird, but fun nonetheless, especially when they did that with each other instead of me. Somehow we all managed to park on the 6th floor in like the same area. Oscar asked me if I'd call him as he was giving me a hug and I said yea, but I'm not sure now. I overheard one day that he has a gf. Hes a nice guy, but I don't wanna be the 'other woman' and I don't think he meant just as coworkers/friends. So yea, confusing. Although it is nice to look over and see him looking at me like I'm beautiful. Its kinda cool to feel attractive, especially when I'm wearing the ugly-ass uniform.
In other news, my mom got a new job, I'm excited for her. Shes going into real estate. So its going to be different, but interesting and fun nonetheless. I found out that my parents do support me going away for college. I got into Otis and was all excited and stuff, but they just seemed uninterested in a way and kept talking about me staying here for college, which I dont really want to do. We're all going to Cali over Spring Break for a few days to visit Otis and its neat that they're interesting in my schooling enough to do that. My dad was talking with me a few days ago about how different Jess and I have become and how a big part of that change was from me going to Atech and getting away from the ""Jessica's little sister"" image I grew up on. One major difference is that shes motivated a lot by money, while I want to be successful not by money but in what I want to do. She's really good with money and I'm not. At work, Sasa couldn't figure out why I wanted to become an animator because it doesnt pay much. I'd rather be doing what I want and be comfortable than rich doing something I dont really like.
I've run out of time to do a lot of things. Everyday gets harder and the workload builds. I get hardly any sleep and barely have time to eat it seems. Don't get me wrong, I'm dedicated to school and I like my new job, I just wish I had time for me. I spend almost all of my free time doing homework. Like tonight, I have to make a poster for Sociology and its due tomorrow. I have to do it today cause its a group project and I cant let my group down. But that means that I'll working on it tonight when I get off at like 11. Who knows, maybe I'll go home like hella early and be able to work on it when I'm still somewhat awake... nah... thats not gonna happen. *sigh*"

"event","So, I'm in my last week of working at ihop. Kinda sad to leave cause all the people there are so nice and awesome, well, almost all! But Mandalay Bay is gonna be fun. I found out that I'm going to be working in the Shark Reef. I've never even been through it, oh well. Looks like an easy job, but hey, it'll be fun. So, back to ihop, on Saturday, I worked up the nerve to tell Justin that I like him, only to find out on Sunday that he doesn't like me back. *shrug* oh well. Not worth getting upset about. I might never see him again. But on Sunday, there was a meeting at ihop at 3, which was the time I was supposed to work, so I ended up going to the meeting. It was about pretty much the same thing the last one was about and I didnt really care, but I was getting out of working. After the meeting, of course the credit cards are off when they go to count down Steve's drawer. So we went through and tried to fix it. I didnt get my drawer until 5:30. Way too long and it wasn't even like completely my drawer cause I was training Sean on cash, which he like already knew, so I didnt work much Sunday night cause Sean was working and training and shit. But anyways, about the drawer, kinda made me mad that Steve was the idiot that messed up and me and Maggie are the ones going through the paperwork to fix it. He should've been doing that, but I know I'm better at it than he is, so I would find the problem faster and he also doesnt give a shit. I think thats what annoys me most about him, he doesnt care about his job or working, just tries to get away doing the least possible, which is why his hours are getting cut and I'm happy about that. So yea, keep getting off topic, but after the meeting, Justin, Luis, and Earl all gave me hugs bye cause I either won't be working with them again or they just felt like it. Was kinda neat to know I'll be missed. Even Maggie said she'll miss me later that night when she was making schedules and asked me (again) what my last day is. Oh well.
I'm starting at Cashman Photography on Saturday, which is exciting. I went down to the Mandalay Bay yesterday to get my uniform like I was told, but since someone bought out the Shark Reef from 4pm until closing, they were very busy at like 3ish when I got there, so in the end, I couldn't get it. So I stood around and watched what they were doing (what I'll soon be doing) and met people. They seem like very fun people. Since I didnt get my uniform yesterday, I have to go back tomorrow to get it. They're so ugly. Not to mention, I also got lost several times just trying to get there and no uniform, psshha! But whatev, it'll be worth it. 
I helped Jess move on Saturday between shifts at work. It was fun. I love her house, its so cute, it'll look great once she gets all settled in and stuff. But it wasn't until we were like done for the day that I realized that I wasnt supposed to do any heavy lifting since I just donated blood on Friday, whoops! oh well. 
Ooh yea, another note on donating blood, I almost passed out at work on Friday, yea, great fun, not. I didnt have time to eat after donating and went like straight to work. However at about 8ish, the fact that I didn't eat was weighing on me, I felt dizzy and lightheaded and stuff. But I ate food and was fine. Fun stuff there. 
I've decided to just stay single until college, which kinda sucks cause it means I'll have been single my entire senior year *gasp* but yea, whatev. I really thought Justin liked me and there was a chance for a casual relationship there, but as it turns out, he acts that way around everyone. What a weirdo. It seems like the guys I like don't like me back and the guys that like me I don't like back. Its not suppposed to work that way! Oh well. Its not worth it to try and get in a relationship for a few months, just to leave. Heartbreak would be too much.
I feel like my group of friends is falling apart and I cant help but feel guilty about it. Since Ray and Chels broke up and no longer want to be in the same room as each other, its like AH! cause Ray hangs out with a different group and Chels hangs out with a different group, it leaves like me and Sean and Jenna (who I like never see) and Stevies (who only exists in IRC now). I feel lost. I'm the only one without another group to fall to. I'm still friends with everyone, but we're not a group anymore, you know? I feel like I don't belong now, which sucks. :(
I know I had more to say, but I just either don't remember or it really wasnt all that important, so yea, whatev. If I remember, I'll update it, but if I don't, then I guess it wasnt important...
And I'm gonna add in a ""fuck you"" just for the hell of it... Fuck you..."

So I put in my two weeks at ihop and I'm gonna miss working with the people there, but I can't pass up this opportunity to work at Cashman. People at ihop have been giving me a hard time for leaving, but I really don't like hosting. Justin got 'mad' at me when he found out, but hes apparently not going to miss me, which makes no sense, but whatever. Courtney told me that I cant leave because I'm her favortie host, but that makes me want to leave even more... But yea, my last day at ihop will be the 24th.
Also, I got into Otis! Go me go me go me! I'm so excited. I can't believe I got in. Its amazing. I'm gonna try to attend the new students orientation thing during spring break and check out the school/housing/etc. make sure its what I want to do. I'm scared to leave, but it will a new and exciting experience. YaY for me!

I've grown to be very apathetic, but I'm emotional, kinda weird. It makes me feel like crap, but I don't care? confusing, yes, I know. I think I'm in one of those stages where you're so tired, you get loopy, cause yea, this blog it kinda weird so far... Woots... So on to something actually interesting?
Work has been fun. Its a lot more fun to be there when all the waiters/hosts are female, just cause theres no one hitting me (except the busers,who I cant understand and Courtney, but I ignore her) and they they talk about the weirdest stuff. The girls will sit around and talk about sex/men/birth/children/random shit and its fun. Earl is nice, but kinda weird and not the greatest conversationalist. Luis is odd, but fun. Hes so gangsta! literally... lol. Justin is awesome. Hes so goofy and fun and is like one of the only guys there that doesn't hit on me! But hes hot and cool, so I wouldn't mind if he did anyways. haha. Hm, yea, I have no life. So I have an interview today at Cashman Photograhy at 4, but it wasn't until I scheduled it that I realized I have to work at 6. Shit. Oh well, I'll be late to work. They don't really need me there tonight anyways. So yea, I might be getting a new job soon, woots... I'll miss goofing off and hanging out with the people at ihop, but more moneys in the photography deal. Yays.
So Jess and Kev are moving out next week, that'll be an interesting change. I've gotten used to having them around, even though I don't talk to them much, just having them there. Soon it'll be me, Dyl, Mom and Dad again. It'll seem so much emptier, but Jess is getting a place of her own and I'm happy for her. Definitely a change and it will be fun to help her design and paint and shit. I'm just that awesome, or something, I dunno. 
I haven't gotten a letter back from Otis yet, the site said I should get a reply in like 3 weeks after they receive my app and its been like 4. like OMFG! haha. But um, yea, I want the letter. I really wanna know if I got in or not. And if I did, I seriously gotta figure out I'm gonna pay for it! But all that will come when it comes. I'm scared to go away for school, but I can't live at home forever. If I want to learn animation and art and stuff, then I have to leave. Nothing around it. It'll be an experience, thats for sure. 
I don't really care much anymore. Its just like Ugh, who cares. Whatever. Apathy Apathy Apathy! *shrug* oh well,  its a way of life, right? Less likely to get hurt this way right? wrong. It still hurts, everything hurts, but I just don't care that it hurts. Make sense? no, well, too bad, fuck you. haha. Its like cut me, I bleed, but I don't care. I'll just shrug, say ""damn, that hurt"" but not do anything to stop you from doing again. Keep going. The more you cut me, the more I bleed, the sooner I'll be gone, invisible, out of your life. Sound like a good deal? yea, thats cause it is, and I don't care. Yay for apathy? for not caring? for being a bitch? Yup, thats me, the apathetic bitch who doesn't care, lovely yes?"

Speaking of work, yesterday was pretty interesting... There's this girl Courtney that works at ihop, usually as a server, but yesterday she was a host. So its me, Courtney, Justin hosting with Luis and Steven (training) on cash. Courtney has always been kinda goofy and weird, so I didn't think anything of it when she was saying she was gonna write on me with a crayon. That is, until Justin said she's hitting on me and I looked at him kinda confused and he said ""Oh you didn't know, shes a lesbian"" oh great. So now I have a lesbian hitting on me that I work with! To make things better, I know Luis and Steve were talking about me over by the register cause I kept hearing them say my name, but everytime I tried to ask them what they were talking about, all I got was ""Nothing"" Bunch of liars. So Courtney is the first to get off, well actually she got an hour and half break since she was working a double and waiting tables that night, but anyway, she leaves. Thank goodness, it was getting hard to avoid her after a while. So I got Justin making fun of me for Courtney and kinda flirting with me in some weird way and Luis and Steve talking about me. Great fun, yea, sure, whatever. I swear, the guys (and Courtney) at ihop really need to get a girl on their own. Like a week ago, one of the busers was hitting on me, except I couldn't understand a word he was saying since I don't speak Spanish and obviously he doesn't know much English since he couldn't understand what I was trying to say to him. Ok, enough about the desperate lives of ihop...
Have you ever heard of Su Doku? Its so fun. My grandma got me, Jess, Dylan, and Steve all hooked on it when she was in town. Its addictive and challenging and I love it. It really gets my mind going. Fun stuff.

"event","Life has been weird lately. I got thinking and realized I'm graduating in like 3 and half months.  I can't believe it! There needs to be more time, I'm not ready. There's so much I wanted to do before graduation and I'm running out of time. Life is so crazy sometimes. I mean, I'm looking forward to graduating and going to college, but not leaving all my friends and starting over. They all mean so much to me. Lately, I've realized how important Ray, Chels, Sean, and Jenna, although I don't see her much anymore, are to me. They're so awesome. Through all the rough times, they are still there for me. Its amazing. I'm really going to miss seeing them all the time and hope we will all keep in touch and stuff in college.
Work's been getting on my nerves lately. Earl freaked out and starting yelling and cussing out the cook the other night and wasn't fired! He really deserved it though. You can't cuss someone out and throw food at them in front of customers and not get in trouble. And everyone was talking about how this wasn't his first time acting like this. Why does he get special treatment? I know I would be fired if I did that, why didn't he? Its not fair. The same reasons I left my last job are still here, hostess/cashiering, making $6 an hour, and other employees getting special treatment. I really need to remember to call that guy from Cashman Photography and get out of ihop.
I'm behind in school, like always, but I'll pull through, I always do, I have to. Thats what everyone says. I always get everything done somehow, but this time... I dunno. It'll be tough. I procrastinate so much and it sucks. I need to do my work and get everything done. I have to. Theres so much pressure on me to do well. 
I got sick a few days ago. Sucks ass. I'm so tired all the time already, but being sick makes it worse. Yesterday, I fell asleep when I got home from school at like 3, woke up at like 7 or 8, did some hw, then fell asleep again at about 11:30, just to wake up at 6. So I got like 10 hours of sleep yesterday and I am still exhausted and tired today, it sucks. I don't have much time to get things done as it is and now I have less time because I need to get more sleep to get better. Ugh! We need to have 30 hour days! Ok, enough of my pointless whiny rambling. Have a nice day :/"

"event","Alright, I'll admit, I've gotten lazy. Its not that I don't have things to update about, its just that I don't care. I didn't bother updating, but now, blah, whatever. 
So, in psychology/sociology class, we got the babies on wednesday. Mine's an Indian baby (we think) and named Makaela. They're so annoying! It cries every fuckin hour for 15 minutes. Omg, I can't wait to get rid of this thing. I don't understand why I need to do this project. I don't want kids, even before we started this, I didn't want kids. Oh well. 
So Sadies, well GR whatev, was on Saturday. It was fun. Sean and I wore black shirts that said ""WTF?"" is big green letters, and Chels and Ray had shirts that said ""The party has arrived"". We met up at Chels's house at about 4 and because I'm retarded and forgetful, we stopped at ihop to get my check, then albertson's to deposit it, or else I would've had like no money. Chels and I decided that this dance really wasn't fair, since we had to pay for everything, but normally we all split. Chels and I got screwed. Anyway, then we went and played laser tag, which was awesome. We kinda grouped up and stuck together, even though it was a solo game. It was funny, my name was O RLY? and Chels was YA RLY. Ray wanted to be <3, but they put it in as lessthan3. haha! Ray's the only one that did good, but it was still so much fun. After that we went to Applebee's for dinner, which was good. And then, finally the dance. They played crappy music, nothing good, it was so annoying. We got pictures and Sean and I got ""married"" by Meikle, which was funny. After a while, we all agreed that the dance was lame, so we decided to head back to Chels's since her parents are out of town, but stopped at Coldstones on the way and got ice cream, since Chels had a coupon. Stevies showed up at Chels's house and we watched movies and goofed off all night. Chels's brother was getting annoyed cause we were noisy, but who cares. Eventually, we finally got to sleep and all was good. The next morning, I made french toast and we watched Moulin Rouge and played Life. For some weird reason, I ended up with 5 kids, while Chels had like none, maybe 1, cant quite remember. I had to have two cars. I also took forever to finish. After they all retired, I took like 5-7 turns by myself while they counted money. The irony was that I dont want kids and had 15million and was a cop stopping people from speeding, when I always speed when I drive. Oh well, I ended up winning with like $2.2 million. Hell yea. 
Then I had to leave and go to work, which was lame. I was doing busy work like the whole night. Refilling syrups, cleaning the mini coolers, restocking, prebusing, shit like that. I seriously need to remember to call that guy from Cashman Photography about a job. ihop's getting annoying. I'm making the same amount being a hostess/cashier that I did at Joey's being omg a hostess/cashier. I need a change! 
I've fallen into another sad/depressed/who gives a shit stage. It started yesterday when I got home from Chels's and I don't know why. I just feel sad for no real reason, its annoying as hell. Oh well, I need to pull myself together and get over it. I can't be like this. I'm supposed to be the cheerful, always there, dependable one. But can I? I don't think so. Last night, on my way home from work, I was so tempted to just run into something, the wall, another car, anything. Just have it all be over, but I didn't. I didn't want to hurt my car or possibly someone else. Just need to find another way and get the guts to go through with it. What the hell am I talking about! Moving on...
So Valentine's Day is tomorrow, what a lame excuse for a holiday. I don't like V-Day. What's so special about love that it needs its own day? V-Day is pointless. Anyone thats single just feels even more lonely and pathetic and people that are together shouldn't need a specific day to celebrate that fact. Stupid really. Very.

Oh yea, forgot to mention. Changed my email. Its now SilverDaisy35@gmail.com instead, cause aol is gay and google isnt. So there. stfu already."

Anywho! On with my life...
I've gotten a lil depressed lately, it was really bad on Friday, I just felt like shit. And I had to work that night. Its so hard to be smiley and cheerful sometimes, but I did it. Wasnt as cheerful as I usually pretend to be, but I smiled, good enough. This always happens. I get a few days, maybe a week tops of happiness, and then I get depressed for like no reason for a while, maybe a couple weeks, and then happy again. Endless cycle, its really quite frustrating. But yea, I'm just emotional.
Works been going ok. Luis told me to take a to-go order over the phone today cause he was too busy, I told him I dont know the menu, so he was like ""Don't you want to be a server?"" and I told him that I would want to, but it doesnt look like I'm getting promoted any day soon. My dad told me about this guy he met at work who pays $15 an hour to hand out flyers. I could so do that. Hes gonna get me info on it. 
Schools been alright, I guess. I'm taking the AMC 12 on Tuesday morning. Hopefully I'll do good on it, but I doubt I will, I'm not nearly as smart as some of those kids. I also have sports pictures Tuesday morning, same time. Its my only chance to get in the yearbook. Oh well, life is lame anyways.
Oh yea, I hate people, have a nice day."

Nothing real exciting or important has really happened, but you probably don't read this for that, you're just someone thats interested in my lame ass life...
Yea, moving on...
ihops been going pretty good. Worked by myself a couple of times, which is fun. Tonight, I worked on word searches most of the night. haha. The mexican cooks and busers keep saying things to me in Spanish, but I have no idea what they are saying. Kinda creepy a bit. I've done a few take-outs, which is cool, more to learn. 
Schools been going good. Second semester already... last semester of high school. How weird! So far, I know I got A's on my Lit, Marine Science, Psychology, Calc AB, and Calc BC exams. I got a C on my Govt exam, but a B overall. I don't know what I got in graphics yet cause they're not updated. So yea, I did good. The exams weren't bad, except Govt, I mean half days kick ass. We went out to eat after school almost every half day, which was cool. 
I asked Sean to Sadies last week also. I got one of those big custom cookies that said ""Will you go to Sadies with me?"" but I couldnt really figure out when to give it to him, so I took it to school with me on Thursday and we went out to lunch (he drove) and it was kinda amusing, I'm carrying this box and neither Sean nor Chels asked me about it. But anyways, I left it in his car when we got back to atech and he didn't notice right away, but later on he did and luckily curiousity got the best of him and he opened it and said yes :D
My daddy worked some knots out of my back a few days ago. It hurt so bad and my back was sore for two days afterwards, but now it feels so much better. I think I'm gonna get him to do it again soon. Sometimes you just need to get the shit beaten outta ya to feel better. lol.
I knew I didnt have much to say. Maybe some other day I'll have something more exciting to write about. Later, stalkers. :P"

"event","I donated blood again today. I enjoy doing that, makes me feel important, accomplished. Last time I went, my mom said she'd go with me, but she chickened out and didn't (actually she forgot and wasn't ready to go). It seemed like it went by a lot faster than it normally does, but I was also reading Don Quixote at the time. So when I was done, I had a few cookies and some juice and on my way out, the girl at the front asked me if I wanted two free tickets to see the show Bite. I had no idea what the show was, so I said sure. Then I realized what kind of show it is, so now I got two free tickets that I will most likely not use. So I got home, played WoW, then went to work. I did something very stupid, didn't eat. I just wasnt hungry, but you're supposed to eat after you donate and after half-way through work, I realized it. I got all dizzy and nauseous and my stomach and head hurt and my heart was pounding. Really sucked. Plus I was standing up rolling silverware, couldn't sit down (I was being paid $5 just to roll silverware). As the night went on, I felt worse, but luckily I got off an hour early and the first thing I did when I got home was eat. I still feel a lil dizzy and nauseous, but not as bad. Learned my lesson, always eat after donating.
Schools been going alright. Exams next week, ew. But hey, the half-day thing totally kicks ass. I'm rather worried about some of my exams though. The 4 day weekend totally kicks ass also. Too bad me and my friends couldn't work out a day where we could do something this weekend, oh well, just means that we have to do something over the half-days.
Its also Friday the 13th, like omg, unlucky. whatev. Silly people. How can a day be unlucky? That just doesnt make much sense to me."

"event","Work's being going alright lately. Areanna and Earl asked me what's going on between me and Luis the other day, which was weird. There's nothing going on. He's a funny guy and fun to talk to, but that's it. He's not my type and I've learned that dating coworkers isn't a good idea. I've got enough problems with my love life as it is, I don't need any more. But yea, all in all, work isn't that bad. I get to sit down and just hang out with coworkers most of the day. Occasionally have to seat people or ring people up, but other than that, sit around, chat, maybe roll silverware. I have to work at 9am on Saturday, which will be interesting because I think mornings will be a lot busier than nights. But whatev, I can handle it.
Things have been turning weird lately. I talked with Sean online quite a bit last night and I dunno. This morning was just kinda awkward, I dunno if it was just me or what. Its weird to feel awkward around one of my closest friends like that. I don't know what to do anymore, about anything. My dad was talking to me about college and the fact that I'm looking at out of state schools. He says that it'd be too much all at once and I'd end up coming home soon after I leave. I guess in a sense, he's right, but he also might be just trying to convince me to stay home cause he doesn't want me to leave. He says that moving out, moving to another state, and starting college are all too big to happen all at once and wants me to stay in town and go to college, then move out of the house, then move out of state. But I don't really want to go to school in Las Vegas. There just aren't my kind of schools here. I don't know what I want to do. I'm sick and tired of being lost, unsure of what to do and all that shit. I need direction, advice, someone to tell me what to do. Life is getting complicated now. Everything's happening all at once. I dont want to grow up yet. I just want time to figure everything out, but I don't think everything can be figured out. Its so confusing. I'm way too indecisive sometimes. This issue's been around quite a while now and I still have no idea what to do. I keep going back and forth, one way to the other. This or that. But I can't decide what's right and what I should do. Ugh, life just sucks sometimes."

"event","alright, so I started working at ihop today. I went in at 6 and the assistant manager that was there didnt know I was going to be there cause I guess the manager didnt say I was starting that day. I filled out paperwork for like an hour, then starting greeting and seating people, which is the first thing I have to master before they'll let me handle the register, phone, and takeouts. Easy stuff. I even got a nametag. The whole time I worked at Joey's I never had a nametag and it always annoyed me that old men thought they can call me whatever they wanted because they didnt know my actual name. I think it'll be neat to be working somewhere structured, with like uniforms and clock-in and stuff. Joey's was so disorganized. But yea, today I worked mostly with Areanna, a hostess, but I met Kelsey (assistant manager), Melanie (waitress), Earl (waiter), and Sonia (waitress). I have a feeling that the fact that Sonia and my name are so similar is gonna get a bit annoying after a while. I have to wear a tie, but whatever. So yea, kinda neat having a job again.
I found out today that my little brother stole a bike from his school a few weeks back. He took it from the bike rack, gave it to another kid, who gave it to another kid, who being a genius, rode it to school today and the actual owner of it saw it and recognized that it was his bike. So they figured out who rode that bike, but that kid told the principal that the other kid gave it to him, who said Dylan gave it to him. Dylan, of course, lied and said he didnt do it at first. He was the only one stupid enough to lie to the principal. They pretty much already knew he did it. After a while, he confessed and got a call home. So now, as far as I know, hes grounded for a week, no friends, no playing outside, no playing Conquer! I think it'll be good for him. I cant believe he would steal a bike and for someone else! He really needs to be taught the difference between right and wrong, acceptable and inacceptable. I also think this experience will be good for my parents. Dylan is the kind of kid that needs a bit of discipline, whereas me and Jessica didnt. My parents dont really know how to discipline, they never really have. Itll be good for them, so they can keep Dylan in line more often. 
Luckily for me, Ms Michels decided to extend the deadline for the campaign project. I was so behind on it. I still have to do a scannable resume, a reply card, and finish up my portfolio. And of course I have to figure out how I'm going to present it all. My portfolio is actually turning out pretty good, not the greatest, but I'm relearning Director in the process. Fun program. It'll be neat. School hasnt been going too bad lately. Got tons I need to do for English, but I'll get it done, always do. In Psychology, we're doing debates, so that should be interesting. I'm the last person in my group to talk, fun... Our topic is ""Surrogacy motherhood should not be banned"" pretty interesting. 
Talked with Jeremy a lot last night. It was really neat. He seemed really curious about me, like he really wanted to know all about me and was asking questions and stuff. Most people probably wouldntve cared and just listened to make it look like they cared. Even more interesting was that he said that his idea of me has changed a bit, but positively, which is surprising cause I was talking about myself, which is a negative topic for me. I dont see how my negativity made a positive impact on his opinion of me. Kinda weird. He also listened and gave his opinion on my views of relationship and my trust issues and things like that. Actually it was pretty good advice, but I doubt its possible. I dont think anyone would fit it. I dunno.
I've also been talking quite a bit more to Sean lately it seems like. I dunno how or when or even why it happened, but it seems like I just talk to him more than I used to. We stood out by our cars (our parking spaces are next to each other) for quite a while yesterday, just talking about all kinds of things. Hes also switching into my Calc AB class because his CS class like died, so his schedule is getting switched around. It'll be neat having him in that class. I honestly dont have like any classes with like any of my friends, so any chance I get to see them is like awesome. I said like way too many times in that sentence. moving on.
Ive been feeling really apathetic and lost lately. I just... I dont know. I feel like I'm just drifitng along on autopilot, I really dont pay attention to whats going on in my life or what should be done for the future. Its just blah. Every day, the same thing, over and over again. I'm stuck in a routine and I just dont care. I dont do anything to change it. My life is a mess and I sit here and do the same thing everyday, autopilot I'm telling you. I'm stuck on autopilot and cant figure out how to turn it off, I'm not even sure if I want to."

50% partner focus, 19% aggressiveness, 40% adventurousness </TD></TR>
<TR><TD> Based on the results of this test, it is highly likely that:

You prefer your romance and love to be traditional rather than daring or out-of-the-ordinary, you would rather be pursued than do the pursuing and, when it comes to physical love, you concentrate more on enjoying the experience rather than worrying about your performance.

This places you in the Lover Style of: <B>The Classic Lover</B>.

The Classic Lover is a wonderful Lover Style, and is the closest it comes to the classic images of the princess in the tower, or the romantic and chivalrous knight, or the hero/heroine from a Disney film. The Classic Lover is a treasure to find, though it can be difficult to do so because they sometimes tend to be shy and/or difficult to successfully court.

In terms of physical love, the Classic Lover again can be shy, and often needs more in terms of emotional security to feel comfortable than some of the other Types. Given the right setting, and the right lover, the Classic Lover can be a delight in bed.

Best Compatibility can probably be found with: The Romantic Lover (most of all) or the Devoted Lover, or the Liberated Lover.

"event","Well, happy new year everyone. Hope you all had a great time celebrating the coming of 2006. Wow, I can't believe its already 2006, I mean, I've been looking forward to it for so long, its like omg, its here. So last night, I thought Chels was throwing a New Years party, but apparently she wasn't and everyone knew but me. I wanted to go out and enjoy New Years, but that didn't really work out. Steve and Sammy wanted to go out, so I watched Hailee all night. So it was me, Dylan, Jess, Hailee, and my daddy home last night. My dad slept through new years because he had to work. Dylan watched TV all night and Jess hung out in her room on the computer I think. She was probably waiting for Kev to get home from work. I watched Princess Bride because I dunno, I felt like it. I've seen that movie a million times, but its still awesome. Hailee was asleep by like 10:30 or so. I ended up playing WoW and talking to Jeremy. I felt like such a loser, midnight came and went and I didn't care. Jess came in my room to see if she could see fireworks from my window, which is silly cause we're so far from the strip, you can't see anything. So I stayed up a while and then I realized that I should really get to bed since I had to get up with Hailee in the morning, who decided that 8am was a good time. Omg, I'm so tired. I've been sleeping in all break and 8am is too early, especially after staying up late. So yea, Happy New Year and hope your new years was more exciting them mine."

"event","ok, yea, haven't updated in a while, so here goes. On Friday, I went into ihop to turn in my application because they told me to, but ugh, the manager was too busy, so I was told to go back on Monday. So I went home and was like ""well, that sucks ass"" and was playing WoW and talking on IRC and got this great idea that we should get together and do something. Eventually, after talking about it for a while in IRC, we decided to go bowling. So I picked Ray and Chels up and met Stevies at the Santa Fe and we went bowling, which was a lot of fun. We were messing with the names and man, are we nerdy! lol. We had like 31337 and H4XR and eventually was got 0RLY? and Y4RLY then N0W41 and Y4W41. Great fun. And it was cosmic bowling, which was neat. And Stevies and I were watching Wheel of Fortune on the TV (no sound of course) and trying to guess the puzzle before they did. We did good too! lol. So then after two games, we decided that we didn't really wanna go home, so we were gonna chill at my house for a while, so I told my mom as we walked pass her bar on the way to the parking garage and we went to my house to play WoW board game. We managed to get it all set up and everything, when Chels said she needed to go home cause she worked in the morning. But we know how to set it up now, so when New Years rolls around and we get together again, BAM, we're playing WoW board game. lol.
Anywhos, Christmas Eve, I didn't really do anything since, omg I already had xmas. On actually xmas, I woke up, not expecting anything and turns out, we got stockings. My parents saved stockings for the actual xmas, but of course, the names were mixed up on the lil packages because of my dad and what he did on our xmas, so I ended up getting things that were supposed to be in Jess's stocking, but she was at work at the time, so I opened her stocking, got my presents and rewrapped the things that were supposed to be in hers, but she got off work early and showed up as I was doing that, so she knew I was wrapping, but didnt see. Kinda funny. But everything worked out. 
Ok, so I went back to ihop on Monday, like I was supposed to and omg, the manager's too busy to give me an interview again, but they at least told me that they are looking for staff, but I have to go back on Friday. This is really driving me insane. I just want to know if they're gonna give me the job or not. After all this, they really should cause that would really suck if they didn't and I kept going back like they asked and no job. Lame! But I got this great idea of what to get Steve and Sammy for xmas (they were in Idaho at the time, so it wasnt really late, but yea whatev). I was the only one (that we know of) and got a picture of the kiss at their wedding, even though the picture is a little fuzzy. I touched it up a bit on the computer and it looked really cute. I also ordered them a cute little ornament online with their names on it. Since it was Monday, my family had dinner together. We went to Que Mas, I think it was called, but I had to drive with my parents in the car (both their cars were low on gas, bad influence!) and well, they arent used to my driving cause I was going a lil fast and they were complaining the whole way about my music. It kinda got on my nerves. If you're riding in MY car, you gonna have to deal with MY driving and MY music! But anyways, it was a neat little place and very good, even though I'm not a big fan of Mexican food. 
So yesterday, I went down to the mall to get a frame for the picture for Steve and Sammy. I went to Things Remembered and guess who I saw! Richard Cox, from my bus last year. It was kinda weird seeing him, but he helped me out and the frame turned out just like I wanted it to, I even got to watch it being engraved, which was kinda neat. And yea, that was all I got from the mall, I wandered around a lot, then I stopped at Target to get the picture developed. I printed a whole 3 pictures, different versions of the same one. I had the color one, a black and white one and one that the lady messed with the contrast of (which turned out kinda crappy, but whatev, it was like 30 cents), so I went home and was deciding which picture (color or black and white) to put in the frame and I couldnt decide, they both looked really good, so I put them both in there. Then I found out that we were celebrating Steve's Bday (which was on Monday) that night, so I had to wrap his bday present (clothes) and then they came over and we had dinner and Steve opened his gifts, he got Polk Audio speakers for his car and we got talking about how weird it is that we have the same name as the company. Steve and Sammy loved the picture and frame I got them and they couldnt decide which they liked better either, so Sammy said shes probably gonna switch out the pictures all the time, lol. And then we had Happy Cake and opened a package from my Aunt Sherry, who missed all our bdays, and inside was a gift to each of us four kids wrapped in bday paper. She missed Jess's, Dylan's and mine, so she sent them all at once along with Steve's (actually on time). She got me a tank-top hand painted by this person in Oregon, it looks really neat, but not the kind of thing I'll wear, thoughtful though. So then Steve, Sammy, and Hailee went home and me, Jess, Dylan, Mom, and Daddy were gonna play Taboo, when the phone rang and my dad got talking to his dad, so we started without him. The teams were even, me and Jess versus Dylan and Mom. Me and Jess were kicking butt, until Daddy came back and joined Dyl and Mom, so they got an extra turn every round, and eventually won, but it was still fun. Me and Jess would've won if we got the same amount of turns. lol Then we played Mexican Train Dominoes until like 11:30. My mom was pretty drunk by the end of it and it was so funny and I told her shes cut off and shes like ""you cant cut *me* off *I* am a profession bartender, you cant cut *me* off"" but she was drunk and it was fun.
And yea, thats pretty much all thats happened lately. Exciting shit, eh? :D"

"event","ok, so, yesterday was Christmas (my family always manages to celebrate holidays on the wrong day, its like a tradition now) and it was awesome. We opened presents when my sister got home from work at about 2:30, but thats ok since I had to go back to the mall and pick something up from Things Remembered at 12 anyways. We (actually just Dylan) sorted all the presents, like usual and everyone's sitting by their pile. Jess is telling Kev to move his pile next to her and Dylan's complaining about his pile being small, when out parents tell Jessica to sit where I'm at, Dylan to sit where Jess is at and me to sit where Dylan is at. They switched the names on all the presents so that we wouldn't be able to guess what we got. Good trick, but it was weird opening gifts that said 'To Dylan' lol. Ok, so I got a new digital camera, its so sexy. I love it. And the WoW board game (woots!), a puzzle, little speakers for my iPod, clothes, slippers, and a dolphin towel with my name on it. Not a whole lot, but the cam and game were two big gifts and I'm so happy. The gifts I got other people... I got Jess and Kev a black photo album engraved 'Jessica and Kevin', but Kevin got Jess the exact same one engraved 'Kevin and Jessica' Kinda funny. Dylan and I got Kev Spongebob Life, which Dylan got as a gift. Also got Jess a crossword puzzle book, which she loves. I got Dylan Civilization 3, which he couldnt figure out how to play, so I was figuring it out and ended up playing for hours this morning... haha. Dylan and I got Mom a clock that tells the temp inside and outside, bath stuff and a Snoopy book and we got daddy a bluetooth keyboard and mouse, which is the same one he was looking at in the store (we didnt know that at the time). My daddy also got new speakers and they sound awesome and they're Polk audio, so they all say Polk on them, haha, how awesome! :D Anywho, we had Christmas dinner together, which was delicious and cheesecake for dessert, yum! And then we were playing Imaginiff because Dylan wanted to, but he ended up getting upset and crying because A. he didn't understand some of the questions and B. he was losing. But the game is supposed to be ages 12 and up, so its understandable that he didnt get it. Mom ended up winning. Fun game, but I was hoping we'd play Cranium, oh well. And then we found out that Kev has never see A Charlie Brown Christmas!! *gasp* We joked that he was kicked out of the house now. Unfortunatly, we couldn't find it, so we watched Its Christmastime Again Charlie Brown, but I fell asleep and yea. Today, Dylan and I (well, actually just me) decorated the gingerbread house that we (I) made the other day. So Dylan had this great idea to do a gingerbread house, but didnt do any of it, I made like the whole thing and then he was whining when I said I was done and we still had more icing left. Oh well, its a cute house. 
Ok, thats enough about Xmas...
I'm applying for a job at ihop as a waitress, you only have to be 18! woots. I hope I get it, waiting tables is good money. I need to get a job, I feel like such a bum lately! I need to get going more on homework too. I've been reading Don Quixote, but I still have like 900 pages left, like omg. lol. 
Yea, as I sit here trying to think of what to write, I realize how lame my life is. Its kinda sad, really, but whatev. Merry Freakin Christmas and all that other stuff... :D"

(haha, procrastination at its finest lol) I seriously need to get a job. I feel so poor and it sucks ass. Today at school was awesome. I watched movies in 1-4 period, ate food and pretended to work in 5-6, but then I had to go to Calc during lunch to do the Maple assignment, which took all of lunch and the beginning of 7th, where we were finishing our quizzes. So after the Maple, I did the rest of my quiz and then started on the quiz from BC that I missed on Wednesday, that I luckily got done before the end of 8th. However, I didn't turn in any homework, because honestly, it wasn't done and I didn't even have time to turn it in. So very easy day until Calc class. Also, I got fuzzy green socks from Jorrel today, that was awesome. 
Ok, so last night I met Jeremy at Macaroni Grill. I pictured him taller, but thats just because he made fun of me so much for being short. I was so nervous, but after being with him a while, I loosened up and it was fun. I was able to joke and act like I do sometimes with people I've known for years. He also brought me a bag of Hershey's Kisses, which was a total surprise and so awesome. We doodled on the table which was fun. He made fun of how I eat, which was mean, but funny and I know he was joking. I don't know yet if there's a potential more-than-friendship relationship. Part is probably because, even though age doesn't mean like anything to me, it does to other people and I wouldn't want the wrong idea getting across. I mean, its more complex than that, but that's something that has occured to me. Well, whether there is or not, he's a great guy and lots of fun to just talk and joke around with. I guess I'll just go with the flow and see how things go (holy shit, I'm a poet! lmao) If something happens, then well, it happens, if not, then ok, that works too.
I just... I don't know anymore... I'm so unsure of things. Oh well, everything will work out eventually, I hope :D"

"event","So today was pretty easy day at school. We read Act 4 of Hamlet in Lit AP, well, actuallly, we like acted it out. It was great. I totally need to study Government over winter break. I'm not doing so good in that class! Must work harder. Marine Science is a joke, like usual. I worked a bit in graphics, but I just didn't feel creative today, which makes it hard to do work in graphics.  Calc AB was boring as usual, stuff I already learned, but BC was interesting. I can really tell I learn in that class. In Psychology, we reviewed for our test and for once, my team won the review game woots and then we worked on our Dating posters and Krishelle pointed out that I was the only white girl in our group (we were seperated into guys and two groups of girls), which was kinda weird cause Fransisco got mad at Dinisha, so she hid behind me and told me to call out for help since I'm a white girl. I was like wha... how screwed up is that? But besides that, the poster thing was interesting. Made me realize how much I want a boyfriend, but I'm not going to be desperate again. I want someone thats gonna really care about me and be there for me. Someone that listens when I have something to say. Someone fun to be around. Conversations could be completely serious or just goofing off, but always comfortable. Someone easy to talk to. Someone... ugh, I dont wanna think about this anymore :(
So today was holiday hat day, so I wore a Santa hat and since I was in a flirtatious/silly mood this morning, it had mistletoe on it and I wore a shirt that said ""Naughty or Nice"" I thought it was cute. But its sad, not a single kiss! lmao. Well, in all honestly, I dont think I would've let most A-tech people kiss me, thats just weird. It would've been funny if they tried though! lol. I feel so Christmas spirit lately. Its fun. I love xmas. Its just such a fun holiday, in theory. lol.
Piccy yayzors!

You know you just wanna make out with me now... all because of the mistletoe! jk.
Well, I should be reading for my next government quiz... :("

"event","Alright, I've been told that I need to update my LJ cause my last entry just sucked, so I am. Yea, I was just in a ""pissed off, I hate everyone"" mood last time. I started thinking about the whole 2005 year in general and I realized that although it was better then 2004, it still kinda sucked. I started '05 in a relationship and only had one other one during the year. I spent most of the year single, which sucks ass. I felt so lonely this year. I guess after such an emotional and painful '04, a lonely year was sure to come. I dont know why, but I'm scared. Scared of being hurt like that again, being treated like that again. I know not all guys are like that, but how can you tell? You can't. I mean, I like someone, but I highly doubt they think of me like that. I'm too scared to try talking to them about it. *pouts* love sucks. lol.
On a different note, I had my last day at Joey's last night. The cooks tried to pie me again, surprise surprise, but they failed! haha, I win. Randy gave me a hug when he left and said that I was a good employee and fun to work with, which is like the nicest thing hes said to me the entire time I worked there. Derek just walked right past me and said 'See ya' but oh well, although yes hes hot, hes not my type. So 9 rolled around and I was getting ready to leave and I went to say bye to Will in the office, who was on the phone. He asked me if it was my last day and I said yea, so he put the person on the phone on hold and gave me a hug and thanked me for working for him. It was kinda neat. Lance gave me a hug too and told me that I need to tell him where I get a job so he can visit me. Shayna was there and even though I barely worked with her, she gave me a hug too. So yea, I'm officially jobless now. 
My internship is also like over. I just have a luncheon thing to go to this week and thats it. It was a fun learning experience and I'm glad I took the chance and went for it. And winter break is almost here. Its weird. I've been so overloaded lately and now like all of it is gone. 
I got my haircut yesterday. Its so cute. I love it :D

I feel so ... rejected ... which doesn't make sense because it wasn't even like that. Ughness! Life just plain old sucks sometimes. yay for being single... ? Geez, I can't even pretend anymore. I dunno, but I thought I was doing a good job pretending to be happy, but who am I kidding? Only myself. I'm not happy. Its been a while since I've been truly happy and even then, it was just because I was with friends. When theres no friends around, I break down. The smile fades, the joy disappears, I honestly look at myself and my life with deep regret. Theres so many things I should've done differently, but its too late. The past will forever haunt the present, theres no way to live it down. Why the hell can't I just be happy? Who the fuck decided that I should be sad and depressed? It just isn't fucking fair. This is useless. Sitting here whining about this. But what the hell am I supposed to do? The person I am interfers with what I want. I have to either give up myself or my desires. Not fucking fair. I need to stop whining. I need someone to just tell me to fucking suck it up bitch."

"event","so yea. I had my bday party on Sat, Dec 3 and it was awesome. We went ice skating and then hung out at my house, goofing off and watching Blue Collar Rides Again and playing Clue. Funny stuff. Only Sean and Stevies showed up to go ice skating, but Chels and Ray showed up at my house later. It was a lot of fun. I love hanging out with them. Stevies was in an *odd* mood and was like hitting onn Sean and making the Clue pieces do weird things. What a perv! jk. It was funny. I haven't found another job yet, but I will. I j ust need to get off my lazy ass one day and just go get applications and stuff. I'm starting to feel lonely again. Its been so long since I had a guy in my life that wasnt just a friend. And I'm sure anyone who reads this has heard the story of the last guy. Ugh, am I like destined to be alone forever? I think I like someone right now, but I'm not sure. Its confusing and weird. I think I need to find another job soon so that I can throw myself into school and work all over again and forget about loneliness. I cant keep doing that forever though. Ughness! But other than that, my life has been going pretty good, I think. I'm not as depressed anymore, I laugh a lot more now. I mean, you only get to be young once right. Why should I waste my youngness on sadness? pointless I tell you, its pointless! I just want ... I dont know ... I dont know what I want, does anyone? Does anyone truly know what they want?"

But anyways. For my birthday, my daddy got off work earlier to spend time with me and was home before my mom left for work, so I opened my gifts then. Omg, I got a Black 60GB iPod Video. Holy Shit its awesome. Thats a hell of a lot of space! It'll be fun though, putting pictures and videos on it. So then, me, daddy, and Dylan went bowling. Omg, the kids in the lane next to us were SO annoying. They were giving me a headache. I hate little kids sometimes, they can be so ugh. lol. And then, my mom showed up. She got off early for my bday also, yayness! lol. After that, we went to dinner at Macaroni Grill. I love that place. It was so funny. Last time we were there, our watier was seriously gay and hitting on my dad! lmao. Well anyways, hes still there, altough he wasn't our waiter, he walked by and like smiled at my dad a lot. It was hilarious. And he was even one of the guys that sang to me when I got my cake. I asked for an application and ugh, they were all out at the time. Stupid people. When we got home, I went to bed and the end! YaY for being 18! Hell yea! :D"

We goof off so much when we're together. We were joking about like everything and it was so much fun and so relaxing to not be worrying about school and college and stuff for once. Then we went to the dance, which was a lot better than homecomings I've been to in the past. People actually danced! It was like OMFG! lol. Chris and Vanessa won King and Queen, which was awesome. They rock. After the dance, we were going to go bowling at the Suncoast, just because it would be SO amusing to bowl in suits and dresses! lol. But it was like an hour wait for a lane and you had to be over 18, which none of us are yet. So instead, we all went over to my house and watched Blue Collar comedy tour. Hilarious. Those guys are awesome. So yea, that was Homecoming and now pics! yay!

"event","Love sucks. Especially when the person you like doesn't like you back. Its depressing. I know he sees me, he looks at me. At first, I believed that look he gets when he'd look at me, like I was the only thing in the world, nothing else mattered, full attention on me for once in my life, but then I realized that he looks at everyone that way. I am no one special, no one important. Loves annoying and it causes more pain than joy. Maybe I'm just scared of it. I'm scared of marriage. I'm terrified that my life would some day be sumed up by this song:

And she takes another step 
Slowly she opens the door 
Check that he is sleeping 
Pick up all the broken glass 
And furniture on the floor 
Been up half the night screaming 
Now it's time to get away 
Pack up the kids in the car 
Another bruise to try and hide 
Another alibi to write 

Another ditch in the road 
You keep moving 
Another stop sign 
You keep moving on 
And the years go by so fast 
Wonder how I ever made it through 

And there are children to think of 
Baby's asleep in the back seat 
Wonder how they'll ever make it 
Through this living nightmare 
But the mind is an amazing thing 
Full of candy dreams and new toys 
And another cheap hotel 
Two beds and a coffee machine 
But there are groceries to buy 
And she knows she'll have to go home 

Another ditch in the road 
You keep moving 
Another stop sign 
You keep moving on 
And the years go by so fast 
Wonder how I ever made it through 

Another bruise to try and hide 
You keep moving 
Another stop sign 
You keep moving on 
And the years go by so fast 
Silent fortress built to last 
Wonder how I ever made it 

I dont want that to be my life story. Running from the person you're supposed to love ""until death do you part."" I don't believe in true love. I don't believe there is anyone that can ""light up my life"" the way they say love is. True love is an illusion and a made-up concept. I should just stop trying to get him to notice me, just more pain would come anyways. People talk about 'moving on', but when you get hurt by someone so much, theres no chance of moving on and trusting again. Its too difficult."

"event","so yea, today I donated blood.  That makes me feel important and useful in a way.  I mean, an hour of my time, which I spent reading Don Quixote (amusing book by the way) and it doesn't hurt at all and I'm saving someone's life.  Its funny how people think it hurts so much, it doesn't.  You barely feel a thing giving blood, or else everyone would be squirming and whining in pain instead of calmly sitting there and usually reading.  The one thing that kinda sucked today about giving blood was the seat I was in was right under the air vent, I was freezing.  It was so hard not to shiver cause you're not supposed to move your arm too much.  I got two free movie tickets out of it, which is pretty cool, except I have no one to go to the movies with.  I didn't even know about them until I was leaving.  Oh well if theres a blood drive at school on Monday, I already had an appointment before I knew about the blood drive.  I convinced my mom that she should donate because theres really not much a point in not donating if you're eligible, cause A. doesn't hurt and B. your body's gonna make more anyways and C. you're saving someone's life.  
Anywho, I've been looking for a new job recently.  I'm tired of Joey's.  They hired a new hostess, its Yvonne's best friend and I don't like her.  She's annoying.  It was funny today at work, Jessica had just got there and we were talking and she's like ""I feel like quitting.  I want out of here"" and I agreed with her and she suggested that we both just walk out and quit tonight, she wasn't serious, but it would've felt nice.  lol.  But she won't leave because its good money and I won't leave cause I haven't found a new job yet.  Working sucks.  I just want to have money and not need to worry about anything, just live my life how I want to, not how I have to in order to *survive*.  
Sadly, I'm still single.  I have a crush on someone, but I have no idea how or if I should tell him.  I mean, I'd feel like an idiot if he didn't like me back.  I'm too scared to talk to people.  Its like I want him to know without me having to tell him or I want him to just magically already like me and tell me.  I'm such a chicken!  lol.

15 days til 18!! woohoo! :D"

"event","Its official. I'm a loser. I'm the biggest a-tech loser. I have seniors that don't know my name. People I've *known* for four years, have no idea what my name is. Am I really that easy to forget? to not notice? not care about? So much for my childish dream of being one of those fun popular prom-queen type girls. I bet that half of the senior class doesn't even know me by name. If somebody said something about Tonya Polk, they'd be like ""who the hell is that?"" Its rather depressing actually. I always dream of winning something. I ran for student council twice, but lost. Everytime we do those yearbook voting things, I always hope theres a chance I could win one of them, but no. I'm not even in the yearbook anymore except for my regular picture. At least freshman year I had a few random pictures because they didn't know me, now they don't want to. I always wonder what would change if I disappear, would people notice? would anyone care? And then I realize that nothing would change. My daily life has no affect on any of my peers. They'd just look around and wonder why theres an empty chair in class now. Am I that unlikable? Whats so wrong with me? Why do I get to be the loser? Did I miss the meeting where we voted on this or something?"

 Other than that. I'm back in GA, hanging out with the family. My family is loving this belly I have, they talk to it, which still wigs me out, and they just love touching. *laughs* I can't wait for December to come, when I can finally see my daughter and hold her. *smiles*

 Okay. I just wanted to be..well me."

  This weekened couldn't be any more amazing. A whole weekend with Johnny. *smiles* I can't wait til he's done filming his movie, then I can see him whenever. But since he's still doing it, I have to enjoy all the time I can get with him, even if it's a few minutes I enjoy it all that I can. But he did say he will be there for me when Anisa is born, so the movie should be done by then <strike>I hope</strike>. We'll never know. Alright. Must go.

 Sad but true. *frowns* Simon, my love, you love to spoil your favorite idol girl. Or well anyone really.

Other than losing my account, Johnny is going to come get me this weekend and we'll have some time together. Charlize is taking the kids I think. *smiles* I swear Johnny spoils me. He's so amazing. 
*sighs hearing the phone ring* Alright, well that's probably my sister, yay. I'll be around.

 I'm so messed up right now, I didn't even care then. But I do now. This baby is something that I know will love me, and be there to try and make me happy.

"event","Erik and I have come to the conclusion that I was sick at the time we found out about the baby, because we would have had no clue that I was pregnant now. I ate something bad, because I ate something before I had a sandwich at the deli and that's when I started feeling horrible. Erik is so smart, he thought of everything. This baby would have still been a mystery if I didn't get sick. Sometimes eating something bad is a good thing, so Erik says. <i>*Smiles and laughs softly*</i>

 So get this. I'm in <b>amazing</b> London, England, been here for almost a week, and I get a call from my management to fly back to LA thursday morning, and I'll be able to fly back thursday night. I have to go onto Seacrest's show and talk to my old pal. I was literally whining into the phone and telling them that I didn't want to leave London, and that they should use an old interview I did, but they wouldn't budge. So I'm leaving for awhile, then I'll be right back. 

 Erik and I are going to head to NYC to see his mother. He's going to tell his mom about the baby. <i>*Sighs*</i> I still need to tell my parents, and my brothers. My brothers are going to be pretty upset..but I promised Erik I wouldn't let them hurt him. I don't break my promises, especially when I promise Erik.

 Anyway! <i>*Laughs, realizing this is turning into a long update.*</i> I told Erik I was going to go bring him shopping and buy him something, since he bought another hott little peice last night. I told him I would buy him anything he needed, but he said all he needed was right here. <i>*Sighs happily, remembering the moment he said that. Continues to type*</i> But finally I got him to say that he wanted something, and he wants a silk robe. So he can be the new Hugh Hefner, but uh..we kinda got detoured. :D I should be going though. I promise Erik will get his robe tomorrow!! Right now we're watching ""Absolutely Fabulous"", funny show."

 But I'll be fine. Tonight I'm going to perform. Erik will give me a massage before I go, so I'll be relaxed and everything. Then I have no clue what I'm going to do. Maybe stick around and meet the AI3 kids, then go home and call Shak so I can have a friend to hang out with.

 First off, I want to say. If I have hurt anyone and I don't know about it..I want to say I am sorry. If you have been hurt by me, it was not intentional. I am not one to hurt people on purpose just for the hell of it. If I have a problem with someone, I will go and talk to them and try to get it settled out. So if any of y'all have been hurt by me, please let me know.

 But yeah. One major thing about today. I'm here in Florida with Erik, and I haven't even seen him all day. Is it crazy that I feel like crying? Not only is it that I haven't seen him all day, I feel like someone or something might split us apart."

 Okay. Well I missed my flight to FL, because I'm waiting for my Erik. But I got us plane tickets for a later flight. So baby, call me and we'll leave. I'll even bring the teddybear you got me.

 Anywho. I partied at Dan and Leigh's last night. I met Angel and Jesse, such awesome people. We played a big ole game of Truth or Dare. Wow, can I honestly say that it was the funniest game. I haven't laughed like that in so long. It felt so good! Some of the dares were interesting and funny. Alex ate a realy worm, Dan and Erik had to do the Elmo Chicken Dance in their boxers, Erik ended up shaking it and singing like Shakira, while I had to ""shake it like a salt shaker"" and kiss everyone in the room. Later in the party Kevin and Alicia came over, both very sweet and a <b>cute</b> couple. Kevin was going to get dared to lick the bottom of his shoe, but Alicia wasn't having it. I don't blame ya girl. So instead of that, he would have to lick Erik's foot. Okay, that's when I said no, don't need Kev licking my baby's foot. <i>*Laughs and takes a sip of some water before typing again.*</i> So since he wasn't going to be licking anything, Kevin ended up singing and doing the dance to Nsync's ""Bye Bye Bye"". It was so funny! My baby got it all on tape, it's great. Then Alicia had to sing the Barney ""I love you"" song with full emotion. <i>*Cracks up*</i> Last night was great.

 And course later today I'll be with my baby in sunny Florida, and watching Britney tomorrow night in concert. Maybe Erik and I will be down there for awhile. Have alittle sunny get away together or something. My manager booked this awesome hotel for me, it's right by the beach, awesome room with a jacuzzi on the balcony. Oh man, I can't wait! I'm going to be having some fun when I get there. But since I'm waiting to get on the plane, I'm going to finish this up my water, then change and go do some last minute shopping.

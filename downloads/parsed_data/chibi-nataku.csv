"event","This feels like the worst day of my life, but I know it actually isn't. Since my practicum, I have lost all confidence in my skills and even the knowledge that I acquired. I feel <i>dumb</i>, and it's the most dishearting feeling in the world. I need to sit down and study my life away just to be successful because my marks are going down hill quickly.

I feel like I should just stay in school for another two years because I'm obviously missing quite a bit of knowledge they are trying to teach us. I hate feeling like this, like I'm some kind of unpopular failure at this program.

Even worse is the fact that I know I'm acting way too emotional about the whole thing, and that the feeling will pass. I just wish I was a better person and better at the things that I try at."

"event","My radiology class is going to be the death of me. I thought that I knew the material fairly well, but the marks that I've been getting back are less than satisfactory. I've never struggled in a class for this program more than radiology. It doesn't help that we have the Marking Nazi as our teacher. She's a great teacher and knows her stuff, but she marks like we should all be going to hell and rotting there. She even marks wrong for different ways of explaining things, so wording things in your own way is out.

I have to start getting prepared for my two practicums too. I really don't know how it will go, since we're thrown into the job with the training that we have, and I can't say that I feel ready. Working in a vet clinic is going to be fun, but I worry that I'm going to feel dumb or something. Plus, the one place that I want to go is relatively inaccessible at this time; I don't really want to pay for a hotel for three weeks.

It sucks staying at school for 11-12 hours a day. I don't have a life, and my moods are crap. :/

I don't even have the motivation for role-playing right now. I can't bring myself to hiatus just yet either. There should be more time in the day."

"event","Has anyone had a job where co-workers make you feel stupid? Like, I know I'm a fairly educated person, but there are a lot of times in my summer job where I am made to feel like not knowing something deserves shunning. I think what's worse is that if you attempt to do something anyway (to stumble your way through and teach it to yourself by reading to box instructions), you get people telling you off. Asking doesn't help, since then they actually tell you to read the box instructions anyway.

There's just something about some of my co-workers that just rub me the wrong way. Some have such a nasty double-standard, especially when it comes to work ethic. It's apparently okay for <i>them</i> to stand around shooting the shit, but damn, if you happen to stop to listen to a story someone is telling, you are going to get told off. I don't think I've actually worked in a place like this before.

It doesn't help that I'm quite tired. School was a whirl-wind tour for eight months and now I'm working as hard as I can to make enough money to pay for the next semester of school. Then I get another whirl-wind tour for another ten months until I graduate with my diploma. I just need a holiday, but I suppose that's something to look forward to... you know, once I graduate, find a job, move house, and settle into a new life completely.

Change is scary sometimes. I just try not to think about it much. Getting through the summer and then second year of school is what stresses me most... and the money issue. :/"

This is yet another pointless and over-dramatized rant about something that bugs me to the bottom most point of my left ventricle (because it is larger and has more power to pump my disdain). It think that it's bothered me for years, since I first became aware of them years and years ago. I find them pointless, cowardly, and a horrible waste of everyone's precious time. They usually end up becoming vile pits for dislike, over-opinionated riff-raff, blatant pointing of fingers and unfounded accusations.

Yes, I'm talking about you ""Anonymous Comms"", where everyone in your f-list supports a horrible way to speak out against injustice (or just rant like a banshee about pointless tripe no one cares about but needs to get a dig about anyway). There are several out there to my knowledge, and I hate every single one of them. They are the most degrading and offensive communities that are on Livejournal.

Now, they are infecting the internet with their srs business crap that involves anonymous memes, anonymous critiques, and anonymous food orders (okay, I made one up). I do know that the internet is clearly srs business, but have we really reduced ourselves to needing to hide behind an anonymous sign just to get a real honest-to-god opinion? And the opinions that <b>are</b> generally had are littered with over-dramatization, break down a person's self-esteem, involve wank like crazy, and breed all manner of hate and dislike.

All of them (communities especially) are like pits of hungry sharks and when blood is introduced, they go <b>CRAZY</b> and take huge bites out of anything in their pond. The slander good communities, good people, and good concepts all for the purpose of 'making something better' or 'just cause'. It's a horrible policy to do business. Cowards do anonymous stuff. Get a backbone and show your face and name if you want to have a real opinion heard.

Livejournal banned communities for sexual content and got flamed for it. Livejournal lets blatant harassment go on under their nose because it doesn't fall in their 'harassment' policy so long as names aren't mentioned or other personal information. It's a piss off.

I hope people who go out of their way to run someone or something down in an anonymous community fall on a pointed stick and have it jab into their liver. They deserve it, the asstards."

"event","School is trying to eat into my skull and devour my poor brain. I think the most difficult class in substance and class experience is Veterinary Clinical Pathology (study of blood and other lovely bodily fluids). It's like a massive info dump every class, and I end up wandering out with a headache every single time.

We have a few new teachers that are kind of so-so with their teaching, but it is their first time. I know some people are frustrated that we are paying money and not actually getting the full teaching experience, but... that's what a textbook is for.

Fecal Fridays... last class of the day and we get to look under a microscope at poop. It is a smelly, kind of nasty feeling lab... but oh so fun. My only frustration is that I haven't seen any little buggly eggs in any of my samples (which is good for the animal but bad for me). I want my learning experience! Where are the bugglies?! So sad... maybe we can view some tapeworm eggs next week.

Though, next week is going to be a like a kick to the teeth. I have a quiz/test every day of the week, sometimes two on one day. Oh my brain... where will you go while I cram information packages inside of you.

All this school work makes it really difficult to RP. I'm having a lot of trouble keeping up with the two that I'm in right now, and I keep telling myself it will be alright. I am coming to realize that I will probably have to drop one of them, but that decision seems so... <i>final</i>.

"event","Spending two years away from school hasn't affected me as much as I thought it might have, but it is hard to keep excellent study habits when I'm used to having evenings and weekends as my own time. It was kind of easy in the beginning and the faculty made it seem like we would be eased in and helped along every step.

Day 3 was like getting smashed with the scientific dictionary. It was fast-paced and difficult to keep up with, and the teachers used words without definition that they expected us to know. It was really the first time that I came home after classes and immediately began to study my course notes to pick up on what I missed... and oh boy, it was a lot that I missed. I figure it gets worse from here on in, so I better get used to feeling frazzled and dumb until the terms become more clear.

Of course, the plus side is that the animals coming in came from my old workplace. Two animals I actually worked with, so I was happy to see them. I was paired up with a dog, but that dog has yet to arrive at the facility. I'm hoping taking the brute for a walk will clear my head and keep my on track!

It's actually kind of bad when I am left wondering who of my class will drop first. I'm hoping that everyone keeps going, but it's more material than even I expected (and I have a degree already). I can only imagine what someone from high school would think about course material like this, but you know what, it has been a long time since I was in high school. Times change, so maybe they will know more than I do.

The hardest part is running from the main building over to the science building. We really have to book it to get there in ten minutes and even then... some of us don't yet make it on time. We may not learn anything but mid-semester but damn it, we'll be in good shape! It will get worse with tons of snow too... I hope it's light this year.

I think my internet time is going to be cut into severely too. It kind of makes me nervous since I like the internet like whoa! We'll see in the coming weeks how things turn out, but I'm hoping that I get a better grasp so I can have my time on the 'net still."

It's only a few more days before <lj user=""ozzypoos""> arrives in Canada to stay with me for the next six months. It feels really weird to think about that, but I think it will be alright as well. I have plenty planned on what we are going to do and see, and I hope she doesn't think trees and mountains are boring or I could be in trouble. XD I'm still laughing about her having to experience a true Canadian winter, though mom says I should take her skiing. That would probably be completely disasterous.

Funny how I am almost finished the next chapter to Killer Instinct, but now that Sephiroth has arrived on the scene with his panties in a bunch I am having writer's block. I really would like to finish the chapter before Ozzy arrives. I figure that punishing Cloud is one thing that I'm really good at, so I'm not sure why my brain is farting over this.

*sigh* I wasted away the entire dinner shift in <lj user=""damned"">. I almost wish that Cloud was medicated in the morning instead of the evening, since it's so hard to get it done.

Unfortunately, that would be so out of character for him, it would probably warrant me getting a slap upside the head.

He's all eager and new and SHINY, and he says the weirdest things. He's so bad about throwing random pieces of unrelated information out in a conversation. I wanted to post for him on the bulletin board, but he's still in the mode of hiding himself from everyone who might be looking for him that I can't.

Not even Edward's shaking or rough way of telling him to get off his duff and do something useful hasn't spurred him enough. So sad he's the kind of guy who lurks around in the shadows because he has so much knowledge to share... and random tangents too. It's fun to have everyone angry at him and he's completely accepting of that fact. I suppose people get really strange when they have lived for 400+ years.

Despite having the largest amount of staff on possible, it seemed like nothing could actually go right. That's actually not true... we cleaned fast and did what had to be done as per general maintance.

<lj-cut text=""Cut for Ranting that probably makes no sense"">
Then I get a call from our health person saying we have 13 cats in our isolation (it can hold 8). So, I take the list of animals there to the assistant Branch Manager to make euthanasia decisions, since we are so over-crowded and that means none of the animals will actually get better. 8 is the maximum we can have (and I'm sure there's some statistics involved somewhere).

I, being certified in able to perform humane euthanasia, had to go and euthanize eight cats in order to make room (since we found out after that we needed to move some into isolation). As those decisions are made, another staff members comes from our intake room and says she was attacked by a cat, so we then had to make decisions for the cat intake room as well.

Sparing the gory details, 15 cats lost their lives today. I hate those days. They are so physically and emotionally draining.

So, then we get this call about a horse stuck in the mud by the overflowing river and unable to escape. It's time for everyone to go home, but myself and that assistant Branch Manager go to attend the call because we are nice like that and I didn't want her to have to do it by herself. It was on native reserve land, so animal control couldn't help us.

We find the property in question and locate the homeowner. Turns out that her husband hates the SPCA, but that aside, we go off to look for this horse. We find it trapped where the land has eroded away and it can't get up, and the husband is all pissy and tells us to go away. We stay anyway in order to help dig a path for the horse to get up, and we managed to calm the husband to accept our help calmly.

Then the two SPCs who we called for some help show up and basically tell us to go away because they can handle it. We leave and are walking through a field before the husband is heard cursing, swearing and shouting at the two SPCs for blundering up the operation and the horse spooked and ran into bushes which made it impossible to continue on with the plan. The nice calm husband who hates the SPCA is now extremely ugly and vulgar, but we leave anyway to let the SPCs handle it, since they messed it up in the first place.

I feel like I should be paid overtime for the hours I put in afterwards. It was a day from hell, and I'm so looking forward to having some time off.

The only nice part is that they are still releasing .Hack//G.U.+ Vol 2... like yesterday. And they are releasing .Hack//XXXX, which made me squee in my pants.

There is so much bad fanfiction out there. It makes me want to cry. I think what I find far worse than bad fiction itself is that some of them start with an absolutely wonderful idea, but either their writing skills or ability to pace out the fic appropriately (sometimes both) is like a kick to the groin.

I find it sad to see such good flickers of ideas get butchered like a baby seal. Of course, it makes me want to write some of those ideas, but I can't. I consider that stealing, even though... it was a terrible fic.

Speaking with a friend about it, it really is sad to have that feeling of being so let down after thinking that the concept would shine through the miles of crap laid on top of it. The painful reading isn't worth for that small gem of an idea. We are both of the thinking that we should write them just so there is something good out there (assuming it can be salvaged).

I was tossing around the idea of doing a few challenges. I was thinking that over and realized that I know so few series that it would be difficult. Damn my sheltered life!

"event","I'm considering quitting my job. It might just be a fleeting feeling, but there are elements in my job which makes things very difficult. There is actually a job opening up in the same position in a different shelter soon, and I've considered applying for it.

I have, unfortunately, stepped up my persistance about forcing euthanasia decisions. We have over 230 cats in our care with a shelter capacity for 75. There is still a road block with some of the employees when it comes to the difference between 'herd health' and 'individual health'. I find myself frustrated by the fact that there is very little support on this difficult decision and to actually make it is like pulling teeth from a baby.

And don't get me started on my euthanasia training... that's a disaster in motion.

Of course, I still am annoyed that I have been appointed Foster Coordinator, but I leave for staff training for a week... and I come back to no fosters left because of an upper-resp outbreak and all the staff wanted to save themselves from having to make euth decisions. That, of course, means I have no fosters for anything that might walk in the door... so we are, in a sense, boned up the ass for weeks. I have 6 week old kittens I have no foster for. -_-

The afterhours phone also really pisses me off. I see it having no point at all. The only people that call wouldn't know what a real emergency was even if it was dying at there feet. No, losing their dog, finding a cat, asking a question completely unrelated to anything that could be an emergency, wondering what their legal rights are... I'm sorry, piss off and stop calling the line reserved for critical distress animals. Call 1-800-I-Don't-Give-A-Shit or 1-800-Shut-Up-You-Whiny-Bitch.

I get yelled at enough during my normal work hours that I really don't need to get yelled at on my own time. It's bad enough how stupid people are. Some of the stories that I could tell right about now.

I find that it doesn't help that I'm so nervous for next week as well. I'm really starting to doubt myself on whether or not I can handle what I'm about to do. It is a very large step that I could be completely excluded from my work for, but aside from one other person, there is no one with the emotional stability to complete this kind of training.

So, how do I feel about the thought of being certified in conducting the technique known as 'euthanasia'? I'm pretty uncertain. I've read and read all the manuels provided on it, but it is the emotional stress that I am concerned about. I have not yet seen a euthanasia, let alone thinking that it will be me easing the suffering of an animal.

I know it will separate me from my co-workers as well. I already feel like they are excluding me after the training was announced.

Mom says all the university level dissections that I have done will help me. I admit that I have seen and done things that a lot of people would revolt at. I just... don't want to grow more emotionally distant at work than I already am. I don't want to be enemy #1 at work.

Interestingly enough... veternarians experience death 5x more than their human-practisioner brethern. However, shelter staff experience death 7x more than either.

There was so much dark humour in it that it had to be appreciated on how well done that was. I want to see it again, if only for how it ends. :D

On a side note, there was a mass backstabbing going on between all of the characters. It was darker than the second movie, for certain. Everyone seemed like they were out to get everyone else, though I still hold true that Will had the most true intentions, even if they became very twisted by his methods.

And seeing Barbossa again made everything so sweet. He is such an awesome character, and, of course, we must not forget the appearance of Jack's dad. That had me laughing my ass off of just who it was. :P

In other news, work is such an interesting place to be in. If I wasn't so invested in the animals that I was taking care of, it would be such an interesting human behavioural study to see. There are so many self-absorbed welfare-greedy, low-lifes that walk into the shelter that it is honestly a little baffling.

Sandra and I are actually thinking of writing a book called ""Shelter Rage"", which is a spin-off of ""Road Rage"" which almost everyone is famous for at least once in their lives. We are thinking of bringing it up with the other staff and seeing what they think of it. We kind of are thinking of it as a humorous but informative guide to shelter life and the incidences that we experience.

One of the best incidences of ""Shelter Rage"" would be a woman calls to apply for our PAL program (an assistance program to help low-income spay/neuter their pets). She knows her income is too high, and she tells our staff member that if she is not approved for the PAL, she will be bringing us her 8 cats. Staff threatening is wonderful but tragic. People really do believe that the light of humanity shines out their assh*le. XD

It is too bad that they don't have mom with them. We are hoping another female in the shelter will take them in, but it is not looking good so far. The mortality rate for babies is high too, but they are adorable.

I actually think I slept about an hour on the plane and that's it <s>Damn you Harry Potter book 6!</s>, and I kept myself up quite easily until 9:30pm on PST. I was very proud of myself.

Australia was pretty damn awesome too! I didn't get attacked by vicious deadly animals, nor did I manage to smuggle home an echidna or koala. I got to see them both, only the koalas in the wild though. I managed to pet and feed kangaroos, walabies and emus though, which as a lot of fun. There was a pelican that was trying to eat bark at one point too... and <lj user=""ozzypoos""> ruined my innocence regarding rainbow macaws >.>

We went on a lot of road tours too, and we saw a lot of ocean and rocks. :D The big things we saw was the Razorback rock formation, The 12 Apostles, the Blowholes (which had fallen into the ocean >.>), a bronze Australian ass aimed at the highway. There were a lot of other things we saw, but their names elude me at this moment. Cleirland National Park was awesome and I highly recommend it to anyone going to Adelaide.

I'll probably go back again to see the Western portion of Australia, and maybe some of the North. I don't have a lot of interest in the Great Barrier Reef, mostly because the sharks there are huge <s>I saw Jaws too many times</s>.

Silly <lj user=""ozzypoos""> managed to get my addicted to the yaoi series called Loveless. I've collected most of the manga and I've seen three episodes of the anime, though I'm sure I can expect more eventually. >.> Loveless was done by the same artist who created Earthian, who's manga I am also collecting because it is so damn awesome.

Finally started on the Fushigi Yuugi Genbu manga as well, and I picked up the Fushigi Yuugi series on DVD too. It will be nice to watch that again and get an idea on what is going on for the Genbu series. I need to write a post for my lovely Russian Suboshi too and German Nakago too. :D"

"event","It is really amazing what some people will consider an emergency. I have been occasionally getting the SPCA emergency phone to answer in the afterhours. Now, this phone is for animals in critical distress. For those that don't know, critical distress is classified as ""a stray animal who life will expire within a short period of time, normally less than an hour"".

These animals have usually been hit by vehicles, dropped off of three-story balconies (don't blink, we had to pick up a dog who had that happen), shot, massive body function shut down. That is the point of the emergency phone, that these animals will normally need to be euthanized humanely. Strays have no apparent owners, and thus, the SPCA has the legal right to euthanize or order veterinary assistance to save an animals life. That's what we are there for.

The emergency phone is for such calls of animals in need of immediate veterinary care. So... when I get a call at 7:43am on my day off, I get a little aggitated when it is <b>not</b> critical distress like...

*phone rings*
ME: Uhhhhh... SPCA, Emergency Line...
LADY: Uh hi! I don't really know if I should be calling here, but I think I saw a dead dog on the side of the highway.
ME: ...you're not sure if it was a dog?
LADY: No, I was just driving by and noticed it as I was going by it.
ME: ...was it moving?
LADY: I... don't really know.
ME: *annoyed* Call animal control. They can pick up dead animals.
LADY: Okay!

...please take in mind that if the dog *had* been moving, it would be critical distress, so it was sort of okay. It was the fact that she didn't really get a good look, I had no other calls, and that particular highway has quite a bit of truck traffic, meaning that ""dog"" could have been a piece of fallen bark or wood from trucks. -_-

Actually, funny enough, that is probably the closest critical distress I have had on the phone. Most people call to ask me if I have heard about if their lost animal has turned up. I even had someone call and it went kind of like this:

*phone rings*
ME: Kamloops SPCA, please state your emergency.
GUY: Well... it's not an emergency, more a question.

I nearly shot myself at that single reply. Why do you call an ""EMERGENCY PHONE NUMBER"" to ask a question that has nothing to do with a critically ill animal? OMG, I wanted to ask him why he called in the first place because he's an idiot and I have to keep the line free for actual emergencies.

Since... getting the emergency phone number, one has to call the SPCA and listen to our answering machine which states, ""if this is an emergency that requires immediate assistance, please call [enter phone number]"". So people have to take the time to write the number down and call it.

Since December, I have never once received a ""true"" emergency call. >.> It just seems to reaffirm the fact that society in general... is very stupid.

The best calls are, ""My dog/cat died in the night. What do I do?"" They get my goat every time, though I admit that if one didn't know, I would be calling around too. Normally, I would call a vet though. Or... I would bury the stupid body in the back yard!"

That epic floats around in my brain every time that I watch it. I think it has potential to be really good, but I wonder if I should make Sephiroth a bit of a demi-god in it. I don't want him a full god, since that would make him an impossible enemy, though according to AC, he had no trouble fighting against Cloud in there. I think I just want him to have a greater edge and make Cloud's situation a little more futile but not impossible.

I suppose it kind of helps that in my new epic, Cloud is 'special'. If I don't do something to Sephiroth, it might actually be Cloud with the edge. What kind of battle would that be? Psht, not much of one... since Cloud tends to win anyway. >.>

So when I get a review that says only bad things and pointing out errors in a way that isn't exactly the nicest, I take slight to it. I don't consider it to be constructive in anyway, unless the construction is to bring someone down and make them feel bad about how they write. It annoys me really, especially when the words ""This isn't a flame and I'm sorry if you take it that way..."" is thrown in at the end.

Sorry, but saying only negative things IS a flame in my eyes. I could just being sensitive, but don't call it something that isn't. A flame, even when put in fine words and grammar, is still a flame.

How is someone supposed to improve on their writing when they don't even know what they are doing right? Maybe it is just that there was nothing right with it in the first place, in which case... don't review. Didn't their mommy teach them, ""If you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all?"" Put the good with the bad, not just the good and not just the bad.
 
A writer can hardly improve their writing if they just feel like crap. I don't think I'm being overly sensitive to it either, since I have received constructive critism on my fics, and I know what it looks like.

So take to heart that constructive means to build someone up and deconstructive is to take them down."

"event","I was given .Hack//G.U. for Christmas, and it made me very happy. I have wanted that game since the beginning of summer and was eagerly awaiting its release in October. I had to hold off getting it since my parents wanted to get it for me for Christmas. My town sucks, so it went out of stock pretty quickly. However, my mom managed to get a copy for me. :)

I finally played it. OMG, that game is so damn awesome! It is much less confusing than the first four games of the original .Hack game... and there is a freaking data anominally that looks like a creepy Kite (main character from first four prequels). The story is pretty good so far, and the improvements to the battle system makes me squee for a long time. >.>

Haseo... Oh Haseo, you are such a bitter asshole. I love his character so much, and he's 10 times worse than Cloud was in the beginning of FFVII. He just tells people off and is quite rude, but somehow, he still manages to get along with some people when... er, they just don't talk. He's an awesome hero though, and I really enjoy him telling people to go away and that he refuses to take orders from anyone. He's quite loveable in that asshole~ish way. Though... with all the facial expressions he can make, I'm afraid that I find him very <s>downright hot and I will molest him</s> attractive. What a cutie.

Some of the female characters are very annoying. Surprisingly though, the dub isn't all that bad. I wish that they had kept the features that allowed for the original Japanese with English subtitles, but since the dub doesn't make me want to scream and bang my head on the floor, I guess that is acceptable. Let's hope the good plot keeps up for awhile yet!

Oh... I got Final Fantasy XII too, but that will have to wait until I finish .Hack//G.U. Haseo will have to suck my soul for like thirty hours yet! Ha!"

That got my feeling paranoid, so I obviously went with the bad first, so it would make the good seem all that much better... though, I thought he would say, ""You failed"".

He didn't thankfully. No, the bad news was that I expressed my answers on the test in an excessive amount of detail. He wanted a few lines for each answer and I gave him a page of writing for each one. He said it was unneeded and excessive... but that he couldn't find any wrong answers in my test either. Apparently, I A'ed it outright.

The good news was that he was certifying me. I am offically a DTA IV assessor and can gauge dog temperament in my shelter as and when required. I was so proud of myself. :D

The best part though was... I was the top in my class. I scored the highest on every aspect of the course, and I failed to acquire any faults for my manners of handling the dog... aka, I didn't put myself in danger. So, I'm head of my class at something! Yay!

I have to drive the highways to get myself and Ange down there, which ultimately freaks me out. The Coquihalla Highway is a death trap in the winter, one that I remember well as a child from the times we went down to the coast to visit family. Ange can't drive, and I kind of knew that I would have to if I got choosen.

So, I'll be down in Vancouver for a week studying my little brains out for dog behaviour. -_- Apparently there is a lot of scientific paper reading, which has been a long time for me. I might actually enjoy it since it has been 8 months since I've really gone through one. Of course, I have to do pre-reading before I head on down there.

The bad part is that I leave the day my parents get back, so I won't even be able to see them or pick them up from the airport. That is really upsetting since I was so looking forward to seeing them again, and they didn't take too well when I said I would get my brother to pick them up. My mom just said, ""We'll take a cab"".

The good part in all this is that all my holidays and stat days that have stacked up are given to me at the end of the year. With this course, I work a total of 8 days in the next four weeks of the schedule. >.> I have like... 5 days off, then work 1 then another 3 off. It's going to be so strange to have so much time off. I might be working Christmas though, as I offered my co-worker Sandra to switch me days (she works Christmas and I work Boxing day) so she could have the holiday off with her husband and not have to drive in from out of town for that."

The malls are already packed, and I'm really already sick of Christmas being a commercial money-job and nothing more. Christmas can just blow me.

It also doesn't help that for some people, I'm lost on gift ideas. Normally, I can think of a lot of things and it's just a matter of finding them, but this year... I'm having a real brain-fart about gifts. Of course, then I worry that people won't like the gifts that I'm getting them, and other people I keep thinking they probably already have the gift I'm thinking of. My brother is the worst person, actually <small>mostly because he's a thieving drug-addicted waste of life</small>.

In some ways, I prefer being at work than at home. At least at work, I can make work for myself whereas at home, I just feel really lonely. I just sell my soul as much as I can to Suikoden V and wait for mom and dad to come home.

I also want to stab my writing Sephiroth muse in the face. It's been too long since I updated my fic, but he refuses to budge, and it is driving me batty at this point. I'm starting to regret my decision to make each chapter a different perspective since Sephiroth is such a loser and his chapters are always shorter than Clouds are. I can't even tempt the guy with candy, and Hades makes him want to throttle something. -_-

Work has turned into a very interesting and stressful place. While it was originally rather stressful trying to keep up with learning, it seems to be stepping up a notch as personal views start to really get in the way. Conflicts that seemed to have been going on for awhile now are starting to really blow up.

It seems that most of the old co-workers are banding together in an attempt to get the Manager fired. They tried meeting with the CEO of the society last night, but the guy apparently never showed up when he said he would. I, of course, knew nothing of this meeting for whatever reason, but Sandra did -_-;;; I found out by Sandra asking about it this morning and Kim informing her the situation, so I was a little boggled.

Also, I get the feeling that Sandra is cracking under the pressure. The last week that I've worked with her, she has nearly or has broken down into tears every day. I feel really bad for her because she's just an awesome person, but I wonder how she will honestly handle neglect and abuse cases when she can't even crate a sick cat for euthanisia. No, it's not an easy job to do, but by now, it should be handled in my opinion... since she has been working longer than I have.

I would hate to see her go. We get along well and have similar work ethics, which makes things a lot easier there.

Still, I'm conflicted on this whole 'overthrow the manager' thing that is going on. I don't know if I should take a side or just stay out of it. I feel like I should do something, but getting involved could put myself at risk as well, since no one talks to me about issues anyway. Still, I have no knowledge of the manager doing anything 'bad', nothing that would warrent this kind of back-stabbing behaviour (but then... these are women we are talking about). It makes me kind of erked.

And, I am one to defend my own gender, but seriously, even I admit that women are horrible people to work with when there is no men to balance the numbers. We have tendencies to back-stab and be overly bitchy for the littlest things. Not all workplaces are like that, but there are more than a few that are. -_-"

"event","Job-related hazards? Yep, got those!

Everybody knows that when you deal with animals, there is a chance that you're going to get hit. I've been 'hit' several times on my hands and arms since starting work at the SPCA, but it was just some of those things that happened. Cats were grumpy; cats were playing; cats were scared.

Dealing the feral (ie wild or non-humanized) cats are a particular hazard in the workplace. People think that cats hanging around should be dealt with, so bring them in and leave us to deal with the mess. Feral cats are normally just hissy, frightened little suckers. Some can be brought around with affection and hard work, while others have been feral too long to be publically safe for adoption.

One of the feral cats and I met up in a battle of wits, strength and sharp claws/teeth. Sandra and I were going to clean the kennel, where it had escaped the day before. We decided it was safest to push the hidey-hole forward to block escape so we could get the litter box and dust. Well, the moment we pushed on the hidey-hole (plastic tub with a round hole at one end usually used as an entrance for litterbox or bed), the cat was up and out.

After cleaning the kennel up, it was my job to grab the sucker and put him back in the kennel. Well... I had the proper gloves on thankfully, but the poor beast managed to swing around in my hold and get ahold of my shirt, where it then processed to haul itself up and across my face. -_- It nailed me pretty good with two scratches down my cheek, one on my nose and several claw marks under my eye (I was fortunate to have glasses so the claws didn't get to my eyes themselves).

He might have nailed me with claws and then tried to rip my thumb off (got a bruise from that) when I caught him again, but I defeated him with a grabbing technique that would make professional wrestlers proud. He went back to his kennel thankfully, and I had to go to the doctor.

Now, I'm on antibiotics to try to keep any infection away. My co-workers were kind of horrified when I first appeared since I had blood running down my face, and then my face started to swell up. Thankfully, I was only hit with claws and not actually bitten, or it might have been much worse than it actually was; cats have very dirty mouths that can lead to horrible things like blood poisoning and severe infections that swell body parts up huge.

I suppose that no one can say my job is boring. I can now put 'cat wrangler' on my resume. I'd still rather deal with cats than some people, quite honestly.

I will have to find a place to share them with other Suikoden fans... if I ever write them. I hope so, but I'm caught up in writing up an email so they might have to wait.

I will comfort myself with Oreos and yaoi. That will solve all that is wrong with the world at this moment. *munches*

Also, I'm not certain if my normal technique of switching between characters POVs from paragraph to paragraph would be successful. Most writings that I've encountered are purely in first person or third person with one main POV per chapter/novel. It's so... not my normal style."

"event","have u ever been somewhere u completely hated, like school, or home, or even a youth home. and when you where there it felt like eternal hell on earth and yet when it came time for you to leave you just looked around and realized that you had more friends than you thought, and there was actually more there than you thought. the hell you saw was just your own mentality that was makin it seem like hell, when infact you had everything ud ever need right there within reach and yet you just didnt see it so you never tryed for it. thats how i feel, i had all these friends, some i didnt even know i had, and i didnt realize it till now. my final day and i now realize that this place though a drag or a pain at times, was a good thing for me to go through. 
As much as you hate something, when u actually sit and look at it, it will show you something, or teach you something u didnt realize was even there. im gonna miss this place, as sad as that sounds. you never realize what you have or what was there for you untill its falling away from you. i just wanna curl up in a corner and jus cry because im leaveing alot of ppl who genuanly care about me and i may never see some of them ever again."

"event","ever just sat down and wondered why in the nine hells you should even be social or make friends in this live?  i have wondered this, even though i have many freinds i would lay my life down for i have also realized, human hide behind a mask to hide their true emotions and feed off others.  well it seems im a smogisborge to these lil muther fuggers, everytime i move i try to keep freinds and it always ends up i get stabed in the back. im done its over my new ""family"" and both my true familys are going to be all i associate with anymore for it seems that i am not needed or wanted by ppl asociated with the thing called ""normal."" well fuck if bein a Witta and enjoyin a sex free live is not normal, then by the gods, im fuckin glad, humnans suck, and as long as i associate with them i will never succed. to anyone not on the list i stated then unless u find a damn good reason i should talk to u, then just leave me alone, i am, as someone dear to my heart says, ""broken beyond repair"" but alas i no longer care, im gonna enjoy my life, my dream and my travel as ive spend alot of my life, ALONE! and quite frankly im just alright with it.  if u wanna find me, i'll be travelin the world, exploring things uve never dreamed of and finding things uve never heard of, im gonna live my dream, so while you guys are keepin yourself in the realm of dreams, im gonna go turn my dreams into my life and spend my days in blissful happiness knowing what i do is something im happy doing, not sumthin im forced to do, if u have a problem with what i say, to bad, im me and ill stay me till the day i die, but atleast ill die with a shovel and a pick on my back and the sun on my shoulders, which is more than i can say for many of you poor pathetic souls."

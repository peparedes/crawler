"event","Okay, so... I have effectively lost my job.  I won't go much into it, but it's not because I did anything wrong, but more it has to do with the fact that I don't have enough experience and can't really keep up.  I'm not all that upset about it or very bitter.  I was pretty bitter last night and there's some edge there still.  I don't plan on visiting that store for a while.  They don't have anything of mine, nor I anything of theirs.

That's all I have to say about that.

Also, remember that thing I did, replacing the jack on the front of my computer?  Well, after it was done I just went ahead and replaced the entire case.  I'm pleased with the result, only partly because the computer looks nicer now, and slightly because I now know that one of the drives is failing, though I'm not exactly sure which one of the four.  Hopefully it's not the primary drive, which is also the largest.

D&amp;D is going well.  I'm running Pathfinder Society Organized Play on SPR.  Very fun, especially since all the combat is done in MapTool.

I'm planning on replacing the GameStop job with temp work.  I can actually make more per hour (than minimum wage), get better hours (than 4-5.5/wk average) with more regularity (than one day a week).  My work history needs some fiber anyway.

Oh... also, Chipotle is an awesome place to eat.  If you've never tried their food, it's sort-of Tex-Mex, Taqueria style.  In addition to their food, salsas and the awesome tortilla chips with a hint of lime, their managers and servers are always friendly.

If you live in Dallas, I especially recommend the new Chipotle location on McKinney Avenue and Armstrong (about a block South of Knox St.).  It's also walking distance from a number of other great shops.<br type=""_moz"" />"

1) I'm unemployed again and have been for the past seven months.  No surprise there.
2) I'm trying to get back into school for a number of reasons which I may or may not enumerate later.
3) Despite my flip-out regarding WotC's release of 4th Edition, my project still stands, and I'm still working on it, on and off, with somewhat lackluster results.  More on this later, maybe.  On a quick sidenote:  Thank goodness for Pathfinder RPG keeping 3.5 alive!
4) I don't have my car anymore.  I got it... I wrecked it.  I paid it off after it was rendered useless as a mode of transportation.  Hopefully with FinAids for #2 I'll have enough to get it repaired.

Anyway, that's the quick recap.  Demand more of me and you just might get your wish. ;)"

"event","<lj-cut text=""Ketchup, anyone?"">I don't know how many of you have wondered where I have been since my most recent entry.  I'm not sure how many of you have removed me from your Friends list, either.  I wouldn't blame you for doing so.  My journal has been left untouched for months.  I just haven't had the time or the interest in sharing my life.  It's been rocks and bumps, and I've been lazy and it killed my romance.

Justin is now seeing our mutual friend Keith, and I'm out of the picture there entirely.  I moved away in September and am already done kicking myself for it.  Honestly, I know it was my fault and though I'm not happy about it I can accept that.  In any case, things work out for the best.  Though I don't feel I can go into detail about it, they are happy together, and that is enough consolation to make me okay with it at the very least.  Don't think for a second that it doesn't hurt.  I love Justin, and I still have a strong attachment to him.  But the time for that ended long after it should have.

I moved away to Tyler, TX for work, to get out of Justin's wallet and out of his (lack of) hair.  Business was already bad between us, and I'm glad the move made things easier for him.  And in the end, for myself.  Going back last weekend to get my stuff was awkward for me.  But he was happy, and that also helped.

I ended up accidentally leaving my nice dress shoes there, and my other tie.  Overall, the trip cost nearly $50, including fuel and food, and I was happy to be reunited with my stuff despite that.  And since that trip, things have gotten better.  Much better.  Much better in ways that may or may not have anything to do with having my stuff back.

When I get upset about how crap my life gets, I often attribute it to outside factors.  My favorite scenario is very paranoid delusional.  It involves an ever-developing story of how a paramilitary group is trying to force me into military recruitment (they've been contracted by the military to do so).  So whenever I try to get work and fail, whenever something in my life goes wrong, I blame them.  I know they're there, influencing my life just so to keep me from winning and being free to enjoy my life as so many of my friends enjoy theirs.

It's an egotistical delusion.  The military wants me because they know my ASVAB scores from high school were really good, and because I was talking about technologies, that they are or have been developing, during my interview with them afterward and want to put my mind to them.  Heh.  It's not so far-fetched, I think, but still, it's a fantasy on which I can blame the seemingly-coincidental things that have held me back.

That delusion, however possible, however egotistical, however contrived, has been my secret sounding board for all of the crap my life has been since I was born.  Granted, all of it is true except for the secret paramilitary organization or other group sabotaging my life.  Rather, that saboteur has been me.  I'm the one who keeps killing things in my life.  I haven't put forth enough effort, or been as motivated, eager, or allowed myself to be as able as I could have been, by choice.  By bad choice.  And a lot of it has to do with depression being a vicious cycle.

I'm 29, now, and approaching 30 every day.  And my life has been shit since before I left high school.  Not all of it I can blame on myself, but the last eleven years of my life could have been better if I'd tried harder, wanted it enough to make it better.

This past week has seen me blessed with not only my old stuff but also what appears to be a new job.  A decent job.  A relatively well-paying job.  It requires moving again, but through the generosity of yet another friend, I will have a place to stay at least until I can afford and can find my own.

A higher-paying position I've never held, and it will also be a job I'm sure I will enjoy.  And that makes things immensely better for me.  A job I will enjoy means I'll be vested in it more fully.  My interest won't drop as quickly, if it does at all, as it has in other jobs I've held.  It means I'll be able to live in a manner that's more me and less like me watching others.  It means I'll be able to save money to do some of the things that I want to do.  It actually means disposable income, if I play my cards right.

And though I would like to attribute this solely to the stern tone in my voice as I told that paramilitary organization (remember, I was talking to myself and not some fictional group) that I was changing the rules, it was also due to a little nudge from some people I am glad to refer to as friends.  Thank you, Club hOtter.

"event","The problem with the whole ""Square Pegs, Round Holes"" idea is that neither the peg nor the hole are square or round.  That a square peg doesn't fit in a round hole is only a surface problem.  The real problem lies in that a square peg is really relatively without shape, and so is the hole.  Sure, they might look like they have shapes, but each is only holding its shape in order to look interesting to look pleasing to the other.  When you try to fit them together it doesn't work.  Each (peg and hole), in an attempt to accomodate the other, changes.

At first, these changes might work, but through continuous association, continuous new accomodation is necessary in order for them to fit.  As the peg changes shape, the hole changes as well, in order to keep up with the peg.  Likewise, the peg changes to keep up with the hole.  Each new change is designed for accomodation, but with each new change comes strain.  Not only can the peg not keep up with the hole (and vice versa), friction occurs when the don't allign properly.  This friction causes damage to both peg and hole.

<lj-cut text=""As an example, I am a peg."">As an example, I am a peg.  I am a square peg, and people who I have called ""my friends"" can be referred to as the hole.  I was doing nothing, tonight, as usual, and I learned that there was a cuddle party that was being held in a friend's room.  We would be watching movies and just cuddling and being close.  There is relatively no sex to it.  If there is, it is usually just in innuendo, and not in action.  So I said I would come, and I would bring a couple of movies to watch.

On my way, I had to grab some food, chips, and a shower (because when you're in close proximity to people you consider your friends, or anyone for that matter, you don't want to smell like a smoky, rotten mongoose).  I was a little late, because I had told another friend I would spend time with her as she worked the front desk of one of the residence halls.  So, on my trip, I bought some food for me, chips for the cuddle/movie party, and then went to bathe.

When I arrived, the friend who was hosting the cuddle party let me into the building, and we went up to her room.  There was no room for me on the beds (her room has two, and they were pushed together).  So I sat at the foot of the bed, watching the movie that was playing.  I have little need to point out that I felt rather left out.  So, I opened the bag of chips and shared them with the puddle of cuddle on the beds.  It was assumed that I was in some way afraid to join in.  I wasn't afraid.  There was no room.  No comfortable space in which I could lay with the group and see the movie playing.

Then, when the film ended, it was time to decide what movie to watch.  We chose ""Shark Tale"", one of the movies I had brought.  That didn't work for very long.  Got to about 30 minutes, and it started skipping ahead, first slowly, then by minutes, and then by fives and tens of minutes.  At about an hour, it started playing normally again.  So we decided it was time to watch a different movie.  We chose ""Short Circuit"", the other movie I had brought with me.  One person left, as he had only wanted to watch ""Shark Tale"".

Two of the people on the bed decided they wanted to sit on the floor, leaving room on the bed.  I went up on the bed, and tried cuddling, but I was told that my skin was too cold.  Then, in what I had believed was a natural thing to do, I put my cold skin on her warm skin.  Eventually, she left the bed.  And I was left confused.  I only learned a few seconds later that she has a real problem with cold skin on warm skin.  Not like I knew, but then, there was only reaction, and not even a brief explaination.

So for a while, I was left alone.  Again.  There were two other people on the bed, and they were cuddling away, watching the movie.  I decided to cuddle with them.  So I brought out my pillow and put it next to one of them, and rested my head on her stomach.  That lasted maybe 30 minutes, and she asked me, however politely, to find another pillow.

Now I'm alone on the bed.  Again.  Why didn't I leave?  I'm too polite.  I didn't let it bother me, outwardly, until later, after everyone was heading off.

These are all people who I have constantly tried to accomodate, within limits.  I didn't stop smoking for them.  That would end horribly.  But I didn't smoke before arriving so that I wouldn't offend their senses.  I also was clean, having freshly taken a shower.

A few of these people have done the cuddle puddle thing before.  One has even invited me to participate.  I declined because I felt uncomfortable with it.  Today I was feeling adventurous, and when I tried to participate, I was shunned, however they didn't realize it at the time.  Whatever.

I, the peg, have tried to accomodate myself to this form of group affection:  A bunch of friends all in a random, strewn about row, just cuddling and enjoying each others' collective company.  And I was interested in participating.  The hole, who were interested in allowing me to participate, ended up not even attempting to accomodate me.  Therefore it was I, the amorphous peg, who had to strain to fit the shape of a suddenly truly round solid hole.  And there was strain.  And friction.  And the backlash is a hurt friend.  Their hurt friend.  Their hurt ""friend"", me.

Needless to say, I won't be participating in such an event again.  I have contemplated unbefriending the entire group.  I don't know what would happen, and though I am hurt enough to do that right now, I don't know if I can see myself shunning all of them for the rest of my stay at this school.  But I am hurt.

I find myself, the amorphous peg, stronger than many of my friends believe.  I am strong, and flexible.  I can change, and I can live through rejection, even as I struggle against it.

And I am writing this odd journal entry, knowing that some of them will read it.  And knowing that most of them don't even realize that it happened.</lj-cut>

What I want you to do, everyone, is reply to this post with the name of a male lj user you think I might like.  Since the current ratio is 21:4 females to males, I figure if each of you posts one male that friend you believe I might get along with, I might be able to bring about some equalibrium.

Please make sure the male person you post is not on my friends list already."

How revealing:  I can now hear clearly from my left ear.  I didn't even notice how bad it was until I was done.  I plan to do it again tomorrow, just to see if I'll be able to hear more when I'm done.

Not that I couldn't hear, before... but hearing isn't hearing, I suppose, if you aren't hearing it all.  My moderately loud music is now difficult to bear.  Fairly loud music becomes almost unbearable.  I doubt I'll have my music as loud as it was the other day, at least for a while, 'cause I think I have to get used to being able to hear.

Now, if I can just get my eyesight figured out...

Oh, and a word to the wise:  Don't shoot tap-hot water into your ear.

<H1>Matthew Pemrich's 10 Year High School Reunion</H1>
Nabbed from <lj user=""eye_of_ra"">

What year was it?
1997-1998 (graduated in October 1998)

What were your three favorite bands or musical artists?
Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Nintendo (I love Video Game music) 

What was your favorite outfit?
Um... Loose fitting comfortable jeans, maybe khakis.  Layered top:  loose unbuttoned button-down shirt over fitting tee-shirt.

What was up with your hair?
Not much, really.  Especially not much more or less than it is now.  Longer, mostly.  And more sun-bleached.

Who were your best friends?
Looking back, they weren't ""best friends"" as much as they were ""people who tolerated me hanging around.""

Where did you work?
Taco Bell.  Doesn't really explain why I still like to eat there...

Did you take the bus?
The place I lived was, like, 15 feet short of the line you had to live on to ride.  We walked about a mile or so... or got a ride.  I liked to walk.

Who did you have a crush on?
I had a girlfriend, who I dumped to go out with someone who was willing to put out.  Too bad.  I'd have done it differently, looking back.

Did you fight with your parents?
I lived in a foster home, so... no.

Who did you have a CELEBRITY crush on?
Um... <a href=""http://www.kayhanley.com/"">Kay Hanley</a>, from <a href=""http://www.letterstocleo.net/"">Letters to Cleo</a>.  No one seems to remember them anymore.  They were the band on the roof at the end of ""<a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0147800/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxzZz0xfGxtPTIwMHx0dD1vbnxwbj0wfHE9MTAgdGhpbmdzfGh0bWw9MXxubT1vbg__;fc=1;ft=21;fm=1"">10 Things I Hate About You.</a>""

Did you smoke cigarettes?
Yeah.

Did you lug all of your books around in your backpack because you were too nervous to find your locker?
Yeah.  I used to carry that thing everywhere.  For a few years, it was like a security blanket.  And for a while, it contained everything I ever owned and cared about.

Did you belong to a clique?
Only the ""cool"" people belonged in cliques.  Idiots, mostly.  None of them ever treated me well, so you can see how I might not like them.

Did you have ""The Max"" like Zach, Kelly, and Slater?
No.

Admit it: were you popular?
Not popular, really.  More like famous.  And then again, not famous, really.  More like infamous.

Who did you want to be just like?
Me.  No one else would do.

What did you want to be when you grew up?
Computer Programmer or PC Technician.

Where did you think you'd be at the age you are now?
I thought I'd be the owner of a successfull multi-million dollar computer company.  Who knew life would suck so bad.

"event","<lj-cut text=""The Commentary"">I guess you could say I'm not really into making a lot of friends on the Internet.  I don't really have a lot of close friends, even away from the Internet, and I'm not sure I really care enough to change that.  I often wonder what it would be like to have a lot of friends.

Technically, I'm an easy-going person.  I like to get along with people, and I like people to get along with me.  This becomes mildly difficult, for some reasons (some I know, and some I can't grasp).

There are a few reasons I noticed in my daily life.  One is that I'm a smoker.  Many people I meet dislike smoking, much like many people dislike homosexuality.  They have that sort of outlook.  Whereas with homosexuality, one might say, ""OK, just don't hit on me and we won't have a problem.""  I've said the same a few times, but that's not the subject of this entry, and can be brooched another time.

Similarly, many people don't have a problem with one's choice to smoke:  ""I don't care if you smoke or not.  Just don't do it here.""  ""...around me.""   ""Don't make me sick with the odor of it.""  ""Don't try getting me to smoke.""

I know there are people, here, on campus who don't like me simply because I smoke.  And, I'm OK with that, and I respect them for that.  They don't want to be involved with a smoker.  Perhaps they dislike smoking, the health effects, the smell.  Whatever.

So, topping my New Year's Resolutions (NYR #1) this year is, ""Quit Smoking.""  I want to quit smoking.  I mean, I like to smoke.  It gives me something to do when I'm bored.  It's a quick pick-me-up in the morning.  It causes me to eat less, and helps me to keep my weight down by making me feel more full after meals.

These aren't good reasons to smoke.  There is no good reason to smoke.

I was looking on the web for information about smoking cessation (quitting), and on one webpage, in an article written in 1997, I read (present tense) that a combination of Zyban (bupropion) and nicotine replacement therapy, for four weeks, produced a 58% quit rate in smokers of 15 or more cigarettes a day.

I don't nearly smoke 15 cigarettes a day, but if they can quit that way, I believe I can.  My financial aid monies come in just over a week.  I know that when I receive that money, there are a few things I'm going to buy, and one of them is Nicorette Gum.  And I'm going to go visit the health center again, this coming week, to see about getting back on bupropion.

I have a tendancy to quit medications just because I forget.  This is another habit I must break.  In fact, I have a tendancy to leave a lot of things unfinished, just because I lose interest in them.  Classes, for instance, also very high on the New Year's Resolution List (NYR #2).

Now, I had planned on purchasing new computer equipment this semester, and I may still.  But I am considering saving that money up.  I could purchase a whole new computer piece-meal (I will never purchase a pre-built computer, as I enjoy building them too much, despite the increased cost of parts) instead of just buying a few parts and building over the course of two semesters.

Unfortunately, one of the other things I noticed bothers people, and causes them to draw poor first-impressions of me, is my appearance.  A strong part of that appearance is my eyes.  Because people can learn a lot about others from their eyes, it comes as no surprise to me that many people thing I have ""shifty eyes"".  I tend to squint a lot, and that could naturally be taken as peering or glaring.  When I have to squint to see a person 40 or 50 feet away, that person may take my facial expression as any number of other negative facial expressions.  When, in fact, I am only trying to see them.  Not their fault.  I need glasses (NYR #3).

Other things about appearance that people may see include my weight (I'm a few pounds overweight), unkempt facial hair (makes me look dirty), and my clothes.  I only own four pair of pants, and two pair of shoes.

So, I will probably be spending a little money on clothes (NYR #4) and Winsor Pilates tapes (NYR #5) (I'm serious... I can't work out in an average guy fassion.  It hurts too much.  My abdominal muscles are so weak that 15 sit-ups can cause muscular pain in my abs for a week).  As for my facial hair, I have the tools, and the time.  It's just motivation I'm lacking (NYR #6).

While we're on the subject of self-improvement, there are several, more interesting, things I want to do this year.  I saw a program on television over the holiday break about a product called EyeQ.  It claims to produce startling positive results in reading and comprehension (I'm a little skeptical, but I'll try it).  I'm also interested in that book, something like ""Natural Remedies <i>They</i> Don't Want You to Know About.""

This year I'm also going to put a lot of work into becoming a Healer.  Herbal remedy books, herbs, Reiki... all kinds of stuff.

<lj-cut text=""The List"">
Well, I'm running dry.  So, here's the list, 1 to 10, of my 2005 New Year's Resolutions:

1.  Quit Smoking!
2.  Attend classes and take time to study.
3.  Get glasses.
4.  Budget money for clothes and shoes.
5.  Budget money for pilates tapes.
6.  Shave more often.
7.  Budget and save money.
8.  Clean room more often.
9.  Work.
10.  Re-get license and car, if possible.

"event","So I've won some auctions, and I really can't afford to buy this stuff, although I have the money.  I won't have much money left after I do, and I don't want to go into default on them, so I have to get them anyhow.  But as you all know, my computer went down recently.  It is rather recently, though you really haven't seen me since... Idunno, um... September?

<lj-cut text=""Well, here's the story"">Well, here's the story.  My computer was doing random things, like rebooting for no reason, and I didn't think much of it.  I just thought it was software problems.  So I kicked it, 'cause... yeah, that always helps.  And then I shut it off, thinking I'd fix it later.  Well, when I went to reboot, it wouldn't do anything.  I had a large electric paperweight.  It'd power up, but nothing not even the POST (Power On Self Test) would show up on the screen.  That's when I knew something was wrong.  So I went out and bought a new powersupply, 'cause at quick glance, there doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary wrong with the computer.

When the $10.00 power supply didn't work, I had to resort to taking the whole thing apart.  Whereby I noticed that one of the canister capacitors had leaked its corrosive goodness out onto the area surrounding where it is mounted to the motherboard.  Upon further inspection, I noted that probably about 16 different canister capacitors have overheated and are useless, thus explaining the lack of motivation in my computer: it's depressed.

So the next thing that happened is I had ordered a new Palm V ""Connected"" Organizer.  <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&rd=1&item=5721313737&ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT"">This very one, in fact.</a>  And it showed up in the mail on the same day my computer went down.  ...See, now we're getting somewhere.  <i>I think my computer is depressed about the fact that it is no longer the only computing device I own.</i>

So anyhow, before I won the auction for the Palm V, I had completed an auction for a keyboard.  Turns out that keyboard doesn't fit the Palm V.  Next thing, so I decide to order a new motherboard.  I ""Buy It Now"" the thing, and later determine that (the reason I chose that one, the fact that it had a Socket 370 for Pentium III Processors) I made the wrong purchase.  So now I have to purchase an additonal processor for the motherboard that made my processor (a working Pentium III) useless.

So I make that purchase, and lo and behold, I'm stupid and bought a slower processor.  And I could have bought another processor for about the same price or less, and it'd have been faster than my old one.  Not only that, but I'm addicted to eBay, and have purchased 6 items since 24Sept... 4 of them in the past three days.

So, if anyone wants to know what the useful items I'm purchasing are, I'll provide links in a comment.</lj-cut>

"event","Well, here's the deal.  I've got to be realistic, and I've got to make decisions, and I've got to make realistic decisions.  So here they are:<lj-cut text=""Right here!"">

1.  I am not the phoenix I thought I was.  I don't stop on a dime and corner like there's no tomorrow.  I don't change like <i>that</i>.  And I've got to stop expecting myself to.  Just like anything else, I change slowly.  I do not go from one thing to another with the snap of my fingers.

2.  I cannot expect everyone to be what I want them to be.  And I cannot always guess what they are.  Sometimes I need them to let me know what they are.  And sometimes they won't; I must learn to accept that.

3.  Just like me, no one else becomes something else in an instant.  Change is slow, steady, and sometimes excruciating.  I understand how painful change can be, because I've often been the one that's changing.

5.  The number 4 doesn't just disappear from the count.

6.  If someone doesn't want to admit to something, no amount of prodding will help.  If anything, it will only make the situation worse.  Prodding only has two effects, and both of them are bad.

7.  If someone doesn't like something I'm doing, that doesn't mean I should keep doing it.  It also doesn't mean I have to stop completely right away.  See #1.  If nothing else, having such a behavior pointed out will help me to identify it in the future and possibly even stop me from doing it before I start.

8.  If someone is doing something I don't like, I have a right to point it out, even if I think it will cause problems.  There can be no problems like those of the built-up stress of being repeatedly exposed to behaviours I can't stand.

9.  If someone has a problem with what I'm doing, I have every right to defend myself if such defense is warranted.  ""Warranted"" does not include excuses.

Sure, I know there's only 8.  I expect that I could be adding more eventually.</lj-cut>"

This is probably one of my favorite movies ever.  It's got as much point to it as A Clockwork Orange or The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  It's no Kubrick film, tho.  Nope.  And it's not really as off the wall in the same way.  And it contains about a zillion times more sex, and even (despite claiming to be a ""Heterosexual Film"") Homo-erotic Innuendo.  It also contains a lot of gore, guns, partial nudity, and drugs.  I strongly suggest anyone see it, though the MPAA rates it ""...R for strong vicious violence, graphic sexuality, pervasive strong language and some drug use,"" and it was banned in South Korea.

--end rave

Besides that, I've been looking for better ways to spend my time than moping around the internet, especially when smoking is not an option.  I think I may try to re-read the Wheel of Time series, while waiting patiently for the next book (which is either the second in the prequel trilogy, or the eleventh in the main series).

I've also been looking at purchasing some Werewolf: The Apocalypse materials so I can begin playing in the White Wolf's World of Darkness.  And probably Mage: The Ascension.  It would be nice.

Anyhow, that's all I've got for now."

Anyhow, after a few days, my moving is complete.  I have checked out of my old room, and all my stuff is in my new room.  Unfortunately for me, I need to unpack a good deal of it.

This room is enjoyable.  It faces North, but is blocked by an evergreen tree, ensuring it won't be too hot in the summer nor too cold in the winter.  I've yet to work out a deal with the tracklighting, so I don't get blinded when I'm walking into or out of the room, but negotiations are going well.

I also find that I'm going to need to rearrange a bit when I get my computer desk (assuming I'm going to get it), but that's alright for now, too.  I also haven't decided whether to hook up my television and stuff.  I think I must, at least before Friday."

""Evan?  How can you be here?""

-----------
Kelly was leaning out the window of his Tucson apartment, waving at Evan as he moved down the front walk, away from the building.  Evan waved back, cheerily.

He got in his Cougar, fastened his safety belt, and drove off, instinctively reaching for the pack of cigarettes not on the passenger seat.  He had quit smoking a month past, now.  He could really use a cigarette, but instead pulled a rattling tin of Altoids gum out of his breast pocket.  As he was putting two pieces in his mouth, his cell phone rang.  Startled, he dropped one of the pieces, and it rolled under the driver seat.

""Damn,"" he cursed as he reached for the phone.  ""Hello?""

""Sergeant Bittinger?""  The voice on the other end asked.

""Speaking,"" Evan replied.

""Sergeant, this is General Borne,"" the voice said, gravely.  ""You are hereby being recalled to active duty, effective immediately.  Report to the nearest military facility for transfer to Scott Naval Base.  You will be briefed upon arrival.""

""Yes, sir,"" he sounded.

""Sergeant, this is top priority.  As soon as you can.""

""Yes, sir.  I understand,"" was the last thing he could say, for shortly thereafter he heard the click of the other line being put down.  He called home to relay the news.

""I can't believe you've been recalled this late in the war,"" Evan's roommate said from the kitchen table, an hour later.  She sounded flabbergasted.  ""I mean, they're almost ready to pull out!""

""I know,"" Evan spoke with resolve, ""but you also know a little about my training, Aimes.  It could be the big mission I've been waiting for.""

Musically, she replied, ""Ohhh-kaay.""  She didn't sound convinced.  Amy had never been too fond of the military.  For as long as he could remember being friends with her, she had always held a strong dislike of politics, wars, and the like.  He never asked why.  She never spoke of it.

""I know, I know,"" he said, distressed, as if he thought he was annoying her.

""Listen,"" she said, turning around to kneel on the kitchen chair.  ""I just want to make sure you'll be able to pay your share of the rent next month.  Last time you went back on active duty, I didn't see any money from you until two weeks before you got back... and you were gone for six months.""

""Alright, already.  I'll make sure you get money as soon as I have a check in my hand.  Matter of fact, I'll deposit it directly to the rent account... what's the account number again?""  They had kept a bank account specifically for rent.  They had an arrangement with the bank that allowed them to make deposits and learn balances, but not withdraw.  The rent was automatically withdrawn monthly and sent to their landlord.

She recited the number, and he took it down.  ""... three... nine... five... eight...""  He wrote it carefully, trying not to smudge the gel ink all over the paper.  When he finished, he got to packing.  It was a short goodbye.

""Remember,"" Amy yelled after him as he was pulling out of the driveway.  ""Remember the rent!""

The drive was long, and hot.  The air conditioner in the old Cougar, now lovingly named ""Leaky,"" hadn't worked since before he bought it.  It was a three-hour drive to the nearest military base, and he had to make several stops along the way.  Most of them for water, but he was used to that.

When he arrived at Johns Air Force Base, the guard checked his ID and called his commander... who in turn had to call General Borne.  Eventually, the guard let him pass, and he was on his way to the plane.

""Sergeant Bittinger?"" the pilot asked.  Evan nodded.  ""Just have a seat in the back.  Make yourself comfortable.  Scott's a long ways off.""

The flight took several hours, sometimes punctuated by a brief stop for fuel.  Evan took the time to read some of the most recent novel by his favorite author, Arthur Rushlight.

When they arrived at Scott Naval Base, General Borne was there to greet him.

Ben collapsed to his haunches, only catching himself by the butt of his gun.

Outside, the yelling got louder.  The blasts against the entrance door rocked the south wall more and more.  One final, small explosion, and the door came crashing in, leaving a cloud of smoke and dust.

Before the smoke cleared, Kelly fired a single incendiary shot into the cloud and ordered everyone back behind the large stone altar.  A burst of flame, a spray of blood, a scream of pain.  To everyone's surprise, Kelly's shot was answered by another.  A second grenade engulfed the people in the entryway.

They had no time to consider what had happened, as their adversaries tried to flood the room.  Time seemed to slow as the killing went on.  Bullets flew everywhere, some ricocheting off the stone walls of the temple.

Phoebe took a shot to the leg, and was sent sliding to her rump.  She held up, continued firing.  Their opponents were going down like dominoes, and neither side was going to stop until the other fell completely.

If it had been obvious to them that they couldn't hold out through this tide, it became painfully more obvious when Ben ran out of ammunition.

Another blast rocked the entryway, and another, but the men kept pouring in.  Soon Phoebe was out of ammunition, as well, and Kelly noted he was low.

But the tide was slowing, something that didn't make any sense to Kelly.  Half the blasts at the entryway weren't his.  Could it be?  He mumbled the name of his lost love, but it was drowned by the gunfire.

All movement stopped.  Sound was lost.  Sight was blurry.  The entryway was empty of life.  A flash of fire, a sonic boom, silence.  Outside could be heard the sounds of a battle that raged on.  Inside, a quiet that deafened.

Kelly exchanged looks with his compatriots.  No one could explain what had just happened.

As they came around the altar, a single shot rang out.  Phoebe dropped to her knees, Ben's agonized scream.  Time slowed again as Kelly searched for the shooter.  There.  In the middle of the pile.  A man dying.  Kelly's shot took less than a millisecond.  Aim came naturally, the trigger squeased itself.

When time resumed, Ben was crying over Phoebe's limp body.  There was movement in the entryway, again.  Kelly's armament swung around to take aim, but what he found made his heart stop.  His knees gave out.

Tentatively, he mouthed the name.  ""Evan?""  His vision clouded with tears, and he closed them.  He raised his voice, just a little.  ""Evan?  How can you be here?""

"event","this is my first live journal acount. i just thought i'd share.

first one is called ""time after time""
<img src=http://img1.photobucket.com/albums/1003/moonie4141/wallpapers/desktop_2.jpg>
this one, ""say anything"" is a 'dirtier' more messy version. as with the two good charlotte songs.
<img src=http://img1.photobucket.com/albums/1003/moonie4141/wallpapers/desktop_3.jpg>

this one is called 'emo' thats what the chinese says on the way right.
<img src=http://img1.photobucket.com/albums/1003/moonie4141/wallpapers/emo_sdfas.jpg>
 
i'll call this one ""in the skies"" *shrug*
<img src=http://img1.photobucket.com/albums/1003/moonie4141/wallpapers/poem_desktop.jpg>

this is called screaming, kinda of creepy.
<img src=http://img1.photobucket.com/albums/1003/moonie4141/wallpapers/screaming.jpg>

and finally, ""words""

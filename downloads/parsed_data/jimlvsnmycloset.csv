"event","after barely getting back from LA (i came up with ryan via car) - the tire blew out, and i got gum in my hair. - a great start.   anyway after barely getting back to san fran, i caught my bus which took me to the amtrak train. I had to catch a bus because trains dont run everywhere.  So the train was a few hours late, which apparently happens all the time, but i did not know that.  So anyway, i got on the train, slept a little, then the trip really began.  i woke up at about 9- well, many other times in the night, but i reallyy woke up at 9.

when i woke up i saw nothing but snow and trees. I'm fairly sure i was oregon at that point, but i may have been in VERY northern cal.  doubt it though.  So i start to wander around, i see someone who said something to me earlier, and decide to sit with him and his friend suzie in the observation car. (it has really big windows so everyone can see outside).  Anyhoo, we all get to talking and his name is pierre- hes from south africa, he's a day trader,and hes 45.....could have passed for 30.  suzie is from seattle and she didnt tell us her age, but she was likely in her 40s or 50s.  So we talk for a looongg time, and he buys us a 10 doller lunch on the dining car- which was pretty tasty for train food i spose. 

Later i start talking to another group of guys (lots of middle aged guys on the train for whatever reason) and we talk about politics, the 60s, drugs, movies, music, records, aids, kodak.....everything.  One man owns a camp in oregon for kids with aids- he used to be a big time money maker for the kodak company, but some chemical they used there caused him to get cancer- and now he's taking it to court.  I hope he wins.  I also got some free financial advice at lunch from a guy who came to sit with us (they dont let people sit alone on the dining car part of the train). He told us so many jokes, but most of them were really quite good. I also learned about the rule of 72.    

i talked to another guy who was sitting across from me about his son alot.  We also talked about school and when the right time to go is, how/if it's important, and we talked about taking time off to do what you feel is right.  He was a cool guy. his name is Lon.  Claire hannah and i gave him a ride to the safeway to meet his son- really nice guy.

i also met a lady downstairs while we were charging our phones- her name is either cheryl or cindy, i think its cheryl though.  She and i talked about religion.  Im spiritual and shes Christian.  But she doesnt like the way churches are handling themselves right now- she also hates pat robertson.  we talked about her kids, and grandkids- who they married, why they did it, her grandson has been clean from speed for 3 months, her daughter used to be a lesbian but now she's married to someone they took into their home after he had done his service in the army...good conversation. she and i also talked about fate, and karma, and divine intervention- all of that. we talked for a good hour and a half.  She said she'd pray for me, and she hopes that i will one day accept the blood of christ--i said thank you. She said she thinks she was meant to meet me- i think thats cool. But i left after that because i had to pee.

i had many more side conversations, of course, but those were the people who really stood out.  I think the hardest part is knowing that i'll probably never see any of them again.  Some people made connections and exchanged numbers, but i didnt.  I was offered two jobs, a bunch of records, financial advice, and a volunteer opportunity- but for some reason, i just didnt give my number or anything like that out.  Didnt strike me as a possibility.  

were these people meant for me to interact with and then be on my way? i have no idea.  When i stepped out of the train and was trying to pick up my stuff, i hear someone shout my name- i look around and see the trian moving and pierre has his head out of one of the windows.....he says something cheesy like sarah take care and follow your dreams- i stick out my hand, so does he, and we high-five as the train makes its way past me.  

aside from the people on the train, i had the opportunity to see some amazing places- the snow in oregon is just beautiful- everything is so awesome.  It made me want to spend a year just traveling around by train cross-country.  Stopping to stay at places where i know people- seeing a little of their lives- learning by experience, talking to people on the train, meeting people, experiencing, growing, but of course, it wont happen- because im supposed to be in my little room in san francisco reading about data analysis in education, or how to write/construct a 5 paragraph paper.....again.



i dont expect anyone to read this really, but if u only scroll to the bottom then take this word of advice: TAKE THE TRAIN. anywhere- and experience it to the fullest extent of its possibilities."

"event","dont know what to feel about class right now, really.

in high school- i could ditch all the time and not feel guilty

now, i dont go to class, usually because im sleeping, and i feel like ive just ruined my chances of getting an A.


i came into college thinking that, fuck, im going to a state school- getting As wont be an issue at all.
As may be an issue

i may even get all Bs this semester

i only got an 88 on my history midterm- thought i did much better
the cinema test is going to be super technical- thats stuff im no good at in general. so who knows.


but would it really be the end of the world if i got 3 bs? 

yes yes it would.

Bs in high school arent a big deal-----what with APs and all


but in college, getting Bs makes ur gpa a 3.0-----which basically sucks

french- cr/nc ----- dont care what i get in that stupid class , muther fuckers
cinema- i have a chance at an A
history- ive got a chance at an A
phil/crit thinkng- im PRAYING for a B- thinking about doing cr/nc for that class as well.....but that would just be a bad idea on my transcript.




ill feel alot better next semester. its true what they say about needing a semester to adjust. i guess i should have listened.




aside from that- i find that getting things done has become increasingly difficult.
im also always tired



so heres my question: (maninly for those of you have gone thru a semester or more of college)_____ how do you study? get things done? whats the best way uve found to do all of ur school work?"

"event","people in college- usually freshman, er always freshman, sometimes sophomores- dont really have any good friends. 
you can spot a freshman from a mile away because they always walk in hords of people and they are almost always groups of the opposite sex. 
this is especially common in freshman who live in the dorms- i dont live in the dorms, i have an apt with 3 other people, so this problem isnt really an issue for us. but its funny to see all of the little indie hipsters walking around town with other little indie hipsters and knowing that none of them know anything significant about the other.  how sad.

on another note!!!!! i LOVE COLLEGE aND I LOVE LOVE LOVE the people ive been meeting. its a great mix of people. i joined hillel and that was fun. but ive also met people who are more like me and are down for anything. sf is fun- just wish id get stuff done. looks like ima have to go to boarders to study, because i cant get shit done here. oh well.

having trouble with ur wireless connection? lets just say that after spending 3 hours on the phone with linksys and sbc im as well trained as any indian woman they have working overseas. 

yesterday i had alot of downtime between classes and i didnt want to walk all the way home. i was on the lawn and i saw a seagul open a paper bag, then empty it, then open and empty a plastic bag which was inside the paper bag. and once he found some wrapped up tinfoil from inside the plastic bag, he managed to unwrap that too- inside, a feast. quite the persistent little bird.


when i was on the phone with the people from the companies today, there was, of course a long list of what i had to do before i could speak to anyone. press one for modem information, press two if ur thumb is up your ass, etc. and so i pressed number 4 or something for NEW CONNECTIVITY TO WIRELESS INTERNET ROUTER. meaning, essentially, this is the nubmer for you if u do not yet have the internet. then they rambled off some WEBSITES for tech support. i love the fact that they give me websites for the help me install the internet section. i love the world.

"event","so coming to college and being away from my entire family for a while has pretty much made me see everyone differently. i understand my mom a little bit better. and i guess i also feel a little for her now. i dont know if we will ever really have an amazing relationship or anything ,but still, its a funny thing when you REALLY REALLY start understanding your parents and realise that they are people, and that they have a past. ive known that for a while now, but now i understand it. and what it means.  
in regards to my dad, i htink there are somethings id rather not know. but i guess thatll never change.
i also found out that some people in my family think i conform, and that i follow the crowd like every other 18 year old they know. that annoys me. because i dont conform. not at all. i dont belong to a group of people, i never have, and yet they are asuming these things about me. i think thats terrible. and the saddest part, is that i have to find out all of this by word of mouth. no one feels that these things are important enough to come to me and talk about them. oh well. some of them are also concerned with me and my uh, habits? i.e. drinking/drugs. those things are a non-issue. i might not be perfect like my brother(in that regard) but still, im not a total fuck up. i try not to let this shit get to me, but what can i say, sometimes it just does.

i dont really know what to think at this point. 
i feel like homer- i went through all the stages of dealing with death very quickly. from denial to acceptance. its strange. i guess itll really set in when i go there in a few minutes to see my grandma, and he isnt there.
we were pretty close, he was a great man. see.....saying was, instead of is makes it real. this is so strange.....
he always told me to do what makes me happy. he hates piercings, but even when i got em, he said, well- we do what makes us happy. and he hugged me


im trying to remember the last thing i said to him. i think i just gave him a hug( he always gave the BEST hugs) and said love ya, cu later. or bye, dont remember which one. 

life is short. it really really really is short. mine is really just begenning. 
ive cried some, but part of me is ok with it. though, he really was the only grandpa i ever had. i think that the only grandkids who this is hard on are chris and myself (chris is my brother) becasue we knew him the longest/best.  jessica who is 10 said she doesnt really mind. thats ok, but its a shame that she will never know him like i did."

its really the best camp in the world. i love it. typical bug juice woodsy camp of aout 250 kids running around . ages 4th grade-11th grade. its awesomeness!



anyhoo- i got home today and i couldnt stop eating this huge bowl of cantaloupe. its really addicting. eh, there are worse things, i suppose.




OH AND IF ANYONE HAS A COWBOY HAT I CAN BORROW FOR A WEEK AT CAMP (I PRRROOMISE I WONT MESS IT UP) - THEN ID REALLY APPRECIATE IT! THANKS!!!!!"

getting sentimental and looking through everything. dont wanna throw some stuff away.

at anyrate- im going to sf for about a week.

"event","<p>I'm writing again, this time because I know I want to. I think, that I'm just going to stare at my hands as I do this. Who cares if I typo. Wow, my hands move so fast, it's amazing to thing that I've memorized where alllll of these buttons are, really. There's how many of them? let me count.&nbsp;<br /><br />`1234567890=/*-qwertyuiop[]\789+ASDFGHJKL;'<br /><br />456<br />123<br />&nbsp;0.<br /><br />ZXCVVBNM,./<br /><br />109. 109 keys. Wow. I know where 109 things are. Why is it so hard to find everything else, then? I didn't sleep well, not at all. In fact, I'm sure I spent more time idly grabbing for an invisible tissue box than I spent trying to go to bed. I spent more time replaying every word you said to me over and over and <em>over </em>again. And then I thought back to all the other times that we had. Like the time on the couch, or the time at the sushi bar, or the first time we made love. All of the times. And through all of them, I tried to find out what I did wrong. Because obviously, I had to have doen SOMETHING wrong, right? I mean, I thought I was doing everything for you, treating you well, making sure thta you knew I was there for you. Making sure that you knew I loved you.<br /><br />But now that I read your journals, I should have known something was going on. You invited him over more than you ever invited me. I should have known. I should have been prepared after the first time you told me. I really should have known. He was the one that comforted you, and that hurts. Because not only did I not <em>know</em> that you needed comforting, you never asked me.&nbsp;<br /><br />What was bothering you, love? Why did you need someone to cry on? Perhaps I'll never get to know. I don't deserve that, right? Right. I was just Tero, the guy that got to you first. The guy who was dumb enough to believe in love.<br /><br />I never used to believe, you know? I used to sleep around all over my old school. Boys, girls, whatever. It didn't matter, so long as I was fullfilling that sexual drive. People knew me for that, and I didn't mind.&nbsp;The minute I met you, though, I decided that I couldn't do that to you.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've made alot of people cry, Jui, do you know that? I've hurt alot of people before, alot of the people I was with thought I loved them, but when&nbsp;I skipped off for my next target,&nbsp;I left them hurting.<br /><br />I knew that I couldn't do that to you when I first saw you. You were beautiful. I told myself that it would be too much of a sin to be the cause of you crying. I mean, why would I ever want to makr you cry in the first place?<br /><br />So, I set out to meet you on the couch with a goal; I would treat you good, make sure that we were friends, and I had to assure that you were more important than anything. And not just you, you're entire being, aside from the phsyical. Your well being was more important, your smile, the way you laughed. Or simply the way you looked at me. I wanted to memorize that before I ever considered getting any sort of sexual arousal and fullfillment out of it.<br /><br />I still don't know if I am typoing. I'm imagining the words appearing on the screen as I type. I don't want to look at them until I'm done.<br /><br />So, in becoming close to you, I learned what <em>love</em> was. I think it's different for everybody, maybe that's what you were trying to tell me earlier. To me, Love is all about being able to sit next to someone and not crave anything else. Sititng next to you was all I ever needed, really. I felt more content and happier than ever when I was walking down to the sushi bar with you, or when I gave you my coat because it was cold.<br /><br />The kisses we shared were like magic, and the first time I made love to you was so overwhelming that I'm surprised I didn't explode or something.<br /><br />Msot people would have out this under a livejournal cut, but I don't feel like it. Anyone can read this. I especially want you and Uruha to read it. I hope he does, too. </p>
<p>I don't know who I'm more mad at, you, him or myself. Hell, I don't even really know if I'm mad. I know I'm defestated...<br /><br />broken<br /><br />lost<br /><br />betrayed<br /><br />But I can't say if I'm mad. Maybe I just wish that you wouldn't have lead me on to believe that you wouldn't do it again.&nbsp;<br /><br />I think&nbsp;I understand though. Karma's back to get me, that's it. For all the people I've hurt and for all the times I've made someone else cry, I'm doomed to feel it ten times worse. Ah, so I see.&nbsp;<br /><br />I don't know if I'll forgive you, though. I mean, should I? I don't want to see you right now. I know when Shou-chan came to visit me earlier, I was afraid to open my door, because I didn't want to see you. My heart tells me that I <em>have </em>to forgive you, because my heart still feels for you. It will unless it decides it doesn't want to. I think my hurting is because my heart really wants nothing more than to be held by you again.<br /><br />But my brain knows that the world doesn't work that way, and it's making sure that my heart doesn't get broken in fourths this time. It knows that you don't <em>want</em> to be faithful. Because if you did, you would be. So, why should my heart devote itself to another heart that has too many open valves?&nbsp;<br /><br />It shouldn't. And it won't. It can hurt all it wants. Cry, heart, cry. But remind my brain to get some water so there's not dehydration, okay?<br /><br />But until, if ever, your heart is willing to be as devoted as mine, my brain is going to be like an escort. ""No, Jui for you, heart! Do your homework instead!"" It'll say.<br /><br />Kiyoharu-san made me eat today, but other than that little bit of chocolate-filled croissant and my cup of hot cocoa, I've had nothing but tylenol and water. I suppose that might explain my stomach ache. Thankfully, I have cookies.<br /><br />Cookies rule the world.<br /><br />So does Yoshiki-sama.<br /><br />He's a better drummer than everyone.<br /><br />COMBINED.<br /><br />~Tero</p>"

Really. 
Why? 

I barely made it back to my room, I stopped in the bathroom to take another shower. I tried to get the water really hot, but it wouldn't. Figures. I don't even know what to write, I'm not even sure if I want to write. I'm shaking and my head hurts from stopping myself from crying. I took medicine already, I had to stop myself from bringing out that bottle of vodka I told Aoi about so long ago. That'd be a perfect way to just relax.&nbsp; 

I feel really empty right now. Worn out. I feel like my muscles are melting along with everything else. I can't imagine what it'll be like when I wake up tomorrow morning with Escort knocking on my door.&nbsp; 

But the truth really is...I've never fallen this hard."

<p><font color=""#ff0000"">I want to find out who was the one who decided it'd be SUCH A FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC idea to turn Jui and I in. It's not like you guys weren't enjoying it! It's not like you guys don't suck face with your little boyfriends in front of everyone.<br /><br />WELL. I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.<br /><br />Now, I can't see the man I love. EVER. I can't even say Hi to him in the hallways! I'll be getting escorted throughout my whole goddamn day. AND, ON TOP OF THAT. I have to clean up after you assholes. SO, IF YOU LEAVE A MESS ON YOUR TABLE. Expect a taiko drum shoved up your ass.<br /><br />Jui kept me calm in ALL-MIGHTY-SLUTFACE's office. But I'm seething now. I wonder if I'm allowed to shower. PROBABLY NOT. I might make him drop his soap in the shower.<br /><br />Goddamnit!<br /><br /><br />And Kiyoharu! MY GOD. He barely had his shirt on, he swore at us and was a total asshole. Back home, had he done that to any of the students at my old school, he would have gotten a fist to his face FROM THE PARENTS.<br /><br />Wait till me dad hears this...but his anger might be overruled by the fact that I got in trouble because I was making out with a GUY.<br /><br />Aaaaagh<br /><br />My escort is lame, too. I tried asking him if he wanted to draw pictures with me in my room and he jsut told me to ""get some quality rest"" MY FIRST CLASS DOESN'T EVEN START UNTIL 10.<br /><br />Aaagh.<br /><br /><u><em><strong>AAAAAGH.<br /><br /></strong></em></u>Seriously! What am I going to do with myself? I suppose I'll have to figure out a way to see him. There's no way I'll be able to SURVIVE without him....<br /><br />I love you, koi. I already need you.<br /><br />~Tero</font></p>"

"event","Ah, the wonders of a boarding school. It's amazing how many people modified their uniforms. Truly, what's the point of them if we decorate it with SEX POT revenge butt pouches and h.naoto patches?&nbsp; Really, we just look like we're all trying to be musicians....or girls that prance along harajuku in Tokyo.<br /><br />Whatever.&nbsp;<br /><br />My classes were pretty okay, the music class was the only one that I liked.<br /><br />I met two....interesting people yesterday, the first was named Aoi, I randomly comandeered him to sit with me at lunch and he tried to get me to drink spiked apple juice. That's great and all, the vodka, but definitely not in apple juice. He was alright, pretty damn hot, too. I was pretty content with him until later when I wandered my happy little ass into the common room.<br /><br />There, I found what I've been looking for. He's probably the prettiest damn thing I've ever seen in&nbsp;my entire life, and if it weren't for the simple fact that I was at school, I may have needed to change my pants right there. School didn't stop me from practically climbing onto him, though. Now, along with being the most arousing person I've ever been around, he also seems to be an interesting person. Maybe I'll actually try to get to <em>know</em> this one first? Ah, my friends back home would be SO proud.<br /><br />But really, this is a new world, maybe it's time for a slightly new edition of Tero? I think so. I want something to actually <em>come</em>&nbsp; out of this year. A nice strong relationship would be one...<br /><br />For now, I'm going to finish up some homework and then sleep. Time for math tomorrow....AGH. What a drag.<br /><br />~ &lt;3 Tero"

"event","I HATE THIS THING. I can't get it to look the way I want, I can't figure out how to do ANYTHING. What am I supposed to do with nothing to work with?&nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe I should have taken those webwriting classes back at my other school?&nbsp;<br /><br />Maybe I should introduce myself.&nbsp; I'm Tero. I just started at Kanagawa School for Boys today and so far, it seems like it might be something interesting. Everyone at the orientation seemed nice, aside from those that didn't really talk. For any of you who go there and are reading this right now, I was the guy with the HAIR. Yeah, the HAIR. It's big, and blonde and red and all over, just like I like it.&nbsp;<br /><br />What I DON'T LIKE is how goddamn small my room is. I have a bed and...something I guess you could call a dresser-desk hybrid. It's like they WANT you to remain in your uniform at ALL hours of EVERYDAY. How is one to fit a large selection of platforms and an even larger selection of clothes? I brought them all, of course, because when I'm not in class, there's NO way I'm staying in that uniform.<br /><br />Unless, of course,&nbsp;I find a way to incooperate the stereo-typical sexual inuendos that come with school uniforms. Maybe if I had a school girl uniform...ah, the possibilities.<br /><br />ALSO! Have I mentioned that the BATHROOMS AND THE SHOWERS are public? How am I to do my make-up with a billion other gruff and stinky boys in the room with me? Agh, I'm glad I brought my vanity mirror.<br /><br />SO far, it seems like it might be fun. I mean, what's greater than a school <em>full</em> of boys?<br /><br />Not much, not much at all.<br /><br />~Tero"

"event","So this weekend was the two month mark since my miscarriage. Larry and I&nbsp;have had great days and a couple of terrible days. We are moving forward as much as it still makes both of us sad to see families and babies. We have talked about&nbsp;things a lot more lately. I am hoping that we can start trying soon. My midwife told us that as soon as I have two periods we can start. So now I am just waiting for my second one....ugh. I have to get an ultra sound done to make sure that the cyst they found during my miscarriage has gone away on its own. If it hasn't, I am not exactly sure what they have to do. It makes me nervous to think about it.

This weekend wasn't great. It started off pretty good, I had to work but Larry and I went shopping after. When we got home, Larry's car was towed. That was the really crappy thing. Larry and I were really mad and annoyed. I went off on the people at the towing company. This ended up getting Larry and I in a fight. He had told me to shut up at the towing company,and it made me mad. I&nbsp;left and drove around for a bit. When I came home I locked myself in our second bedroom. I wasn't even really mad at Larry! That is the shitty part. It was the 7th, and I was thinking about my miscarriage in the back of my head the whole day, The fact that Larry's car was towed and we had to spend 140 bucks to get it back, and then Larry telling me to shut up, I just got so upset. I didn't want Larry to see me break down. I cried for so long. I slept in the second bedroom that night too because I couldn't bring myself to be around Larry."

"event","<br />I am married to the most amazing man. Larry is absolutely amazing. I love him. He means everything to me. He really makes me so unbelievably happy. Larry takes care of me. He is going to be a wonderful father when we finally are able to have some.<br />When we got back from our honeymoon, we found out that I was pregnant. We were so very happy. We made the doctor's appointment and started looking for baby stuff. I was so tired all the time and alot of the time I couldn't eat. I was in a constant state of queezy. But we were so happy. On Monday September 7, 2009 I went to work. I wasn't feeling that great, but I went to work anyways. Larry had the day off and told me that I should come home early if I felt worse. I took it easy at work, sitting down most of the time. When I went to lunch, I felt terrible. I started feeling like my stomach was cramping. I was really worried, so I called my mom and she came to bring me to the emergency room. I called and let Larry know, and he got to the ER shortly after my mom and I arrived. I knew Larry loved me for a long time, but if I had any doubt at all, I would have known for sure when&nbsp;I saw him comming into to hospital. I even looked at my parents and told them &quot;Larry loves me, look you can tell&quot;. He looked so worried.<br />By the time he got to the ER, I felt like I was going to pass out. Larry went with me to the bathroom, and got me a wheelchair and wheeled me around. He also got me an orange. I felt a little better after eating, but I new something was wrong. I was bleeding like a period and my cramps were pretty bad.<br />Larry stayed with me the whole time I was in the ER. We were there from 7:00 to 1:30 in the morning.&nbsp;It was the most tramatic experience I have ever been through. Larry was there with me every minute. He watched the ultrasound that showed that Shed was no longer there. He was there for everything. I was in shock. I kept telling everyone that we just had to deal with whatever was happening then so that we could all go home and my parents could go on their anniversery vacation. <br />Larry shut down after a couple of hours at the ER. I could tell that he was in just as much pain as I was. But he stayed with me and took care of me. We barely spoke for a couple of days. We only talked about things that we had to. I was really worried about us for a while.<br /><br />I know that Larry loves me. We are getting better now. I still miss when Larry used to come home and kiss my belly and talk to it. I&nbsp;miss the mornings when we would wake up in bed, and lay there in each others arms just talking about Shed. &nbsp;But I knnow that Larry still needs a little time. Oh yeah to make things even worse, I caught the flu while at the ER. So not only did Larry and I have to not have sex for over a week, but I could barely kiss him. It was such a terrible week. I wanted so much to be close to my husband, but I knew that I could not. It was tourture. I missed him so much. <em><br /><br /></em><br />"

"event","Larry and I are moving into our new place on Friday! I am so excied! This has been a long year, waiting to move! When I lost my job in October I thought that we wouldn't be able to move out at all. I am happy to say that losing my job at Target could probably be the second best thing that happened to me last year. (the first being getting engaged to Larry of course!) I&nbsp;am now going back to school full time! I would have never gone back if I was still at Target. I am only working part time right now at WalMart. I have to say, I am kind of happy to be back there. Even though I&nbsp;miss most of the people that I worked with at Target, I have settled in at WalMart. I have made a bunch of new friends too.
I am so happy that I am going back to school. I am such a nerd about it too. I actually do most of my homework. There are times when I take the easy way out. This semester I am taking all non education courses. It gets kind of hard when I have to get up for English, or go online for Biology, but Larry reminds me that this is so I can do what I actually want.
Even with me making less than I was a Target, and only working part time, Larry and I are still able to get a two bedroom apartment in South Hadley. I have paid off so much of my bills in the year that I have been living with my parents.&nbsp;Larry has done a pretty good job himself. We saved all of our Christmas money this year and used it towards wedding and moving expenses. I got a decent amount back for my taxes too so that helped with the first payments to move out. I have gotten to the point where I have extra money in my account when I get paid every week. That is nice because now I can help a little more with expenses. Larry has been so amazing the last couple of months.

I am so happy we have our own place! Most of our stuff is already to go,"

"event","So I am working at Walmart again. It kind of sucks since I&nbsp;am not making nearly as much as I was at Target. At least I do have a job. It isn't so bad being back there. I&nbsp;still know alot of the people that work there so it was an easy transition. It has been a little stressful lately with the money situation. It took a little while longer than I wanted to get into Walmart, so my checking account got lower than I wanted. Plus my first check was only for one week so it was lower than what will be my new usual. I was supposed to only be hired as temp since it was so close to Christmas but Sue and Jeremy worked out that I would work part time for now so that they can keep me on. They have been sceduling me right at the line so that I get as many hours as possible. Sue is actually working on something for me too which is good. I&nbsp;am still looking for a better paying job though.

Larry didn't get the job that he wanted at Evergreen. They are considering him for another job though. I don't think that he will take it though. He has been pretty upset about it lately. It sucks when he is like that cause he just shuts down and doesn't talk to me about it at all. I didn't even find out about the job thing until later the day he found out. When we did talk the other night, it seemed like he felt like I was disappointed in him or that he let me down somehow. I love him so much. He was talking about how bad he wanted the job so that I could go back to school and whatnot. I am sure that wasnt the real main reason that he wanted that job. I know he hates his job. I think he has more issues at his job than he lets me know. I think he talks to Brad about it though so at least he talks to someone. 

I think Larry is also upset with the fact that Brad is working at Evergreen too. Larry was the one who told Brad about the job and now Brad is really trying to get Larry a job there and it just isn't working out the way Larry wanted it to. I wish there was something that I could do to help. I also wish there was something I could do for a new job for myself.

On a happier note, Larry and I are looking at an apartment on Wednesday. We are looking into moving to Westfield. Erik may move in with us too. We are looking at the same place that I lived with Matt, Brian and Ray. I am really excited to finally have our own place!

Wedding plans have kind of come to&nbsp;a stop for a little bit. I did buy my wedding dress though. I think that is the last money that I have spent on the wedding lately."

"event","So I was right. My boss was trying to fire me. She did fire me on Monday. She was really sneaky about it too. She didn't talk to any of the others executives in the building about it. They were all pretty upset about it. I am mad too, since this whole thing started because of her wanting to fire someone else and I stood up for him. He still got fired and I did too. She said that I was hindering the team. She didn't like the fact that I had their loyalty and respect and she did not.

Sucks for her though, I still have their loyalty. Alot of the team members were really upset about everything. Some wrote her a letter. They were talking about looking for other jobs and what not. I think they are planning a mass call out day. I would love to go into Target that day and laugh at her. They do not respect her anymore. Oh well.

I was ok with it for the last two days. Although today was kind of upsetting since I should have been at work today. I normally have Tuesdays off so it didn't really sink in yet. I applied for a bunch of jobs last night. Today I decided to apply at Walmart again. I am pretty sure that I can still work there. The store manager was pretty cool then. I applied to be a department manager though. I don't really want to work on the weekends anymore. Since they work Monday thru Friday 7:00-4:00. I think that will be ok. Although I would be working opposite of Larry. 

We will see how things go. I am babysitting Riley tomorrow. She is Larry's friend Brad and his wife Lauren's daughter. She is like seven months old, and I have only seen her three times. I hope she takes to me well. So far all the babies lately that have been around me have taken to me very quickly. I am sure I will do fine, I just don't want her to cry the whole time, since Brad will be trying to sleep before he goes to work."

"event","Work has been pretty stressful for me lately. I am still not on speaking terms really with my boss. I think it has been about a month now. I found out yesterday that she has been talking to team members and asking them if they have any problems with me and I guess some of them felt like she was trying to get them to say something that they didn't mean. One of them said that she was pretty intimidating. Whatever. I am really hoping to be out of Target by the second week in November. Just in time for their &quot;Reindeer Run Visit&quot; I want to stick around long enough to see them fall on their faces. We had a visit today and I guess it didn't go very well. Although I don't actually know that since Chivon never talked to me about it. I talked to Farai about it today.

On a happier note. Larry gave me my engagment ring on Wednesday. I wasn't supposed to get it until today, but he is amazing and knew I was having a hard time at work. I love him so much. He stands by me 100% of the time. He always tells me if I am over reacting about something and when I am not. He takes care of me.

I&nbsp;am calling The Bridal Barn tomorrow morning to make an appointment to try on wedding dresses hopfully on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, we are hopefully getting our engagment photos done! I am so excited. If we are able to get our photos done on Tuesday, they will so beautiful with all the foliage around us. We are going to have them done at Look Park. Even though our wedding pictures will be taken there as well. We are planning on taking them in two different areas of the park for each. I think they will come out really nice. 

Larry will probably give me shit, but if we are able to get our photos done on Tuesday, I want to get&nbsp;something new/nice to wear. I also want to get my nails done so they will look nice with my ring. I am probably pushing it, but it would be nice to get my hair done too. Although I will probably just do that myself.

I&nbsp;have this weekend off. Larry and I are planning on going to Six Flags with Nikki. We wanted someone else to go with us so that Nikki would have a ride partner, but so far there has been no luck. &nbsp;I hope she still wants to go though. It is nice that we are getting along so great now. Larry and her are getting along too!"

"event","Larry and I have gotten so much done for our wedding in the last five days! I am so excited! Larry and I met with the photographer on Friday. We are going to get our engagment photos done with him sometime this month. The sooner the better. Friday night we went up to Brattleboro VT. We (mostly me) just needed to get away for a night. We had a really good time too. It was nice and relaxing. When we got up Saturday morning we took our time comming home. We stopped at Bickfords for breakfast. We took the long scenic route home too. It was nice until both of us got a little cranky and wanted to get home. Saturday was my dad's birthday, so we went out to eat with him and my mom. When we got home we decided to go out with Seth. We went to the WWII Club for a couple of drinks and then to Silk City. It was actually pretty fun. Seth didn't get too crazy and I saw Torin, who I never see anymore. 

Sunday we slept in. It was nice to just stay in bed another morning with Larry. We went to the mall Sunday afternoon. We got some paper for programs and other things for our Jack and Jill. We decided on our center pieces at the reception. We have a rough idea of what we want our programs to look like. I&nbsp;also tested out our wedding invitations. We are going to print them from home, since they actually look really nice.

Monday and Tuesday I had off from work too, so it was nice to be able to spend some more time with Larry. We cleaned the dinning room Sunday night so I was able to use the dining table Monday night to work on some of our invites and programs. Today, Larry called Look Park and we reserved the Pines Theater for our ceremony! Yay!&nbsp;Also, Larry and I went to the mall today and looked at some engagement rings. I saw the one I wanted at Kay's on Sunday, but when we went today the woman that we originally talked to wasn't there. The new woman had no idea what we were talking about in concearn to the price of the ring. I was sad beacause I really wanted that ring. Larry got me to go to Belden's just to look. They had the same exact ring that I liked at Kay's and it was on sale there! Larry was going to buy it out today but I didn't want him to shell out too much. We both are low on funds this week since we have been putting deposits down on everything. So he put it on Layaway. He plans on picking it up next Friday!!!!&nbsp; Our list of accomplished wedding tasks is getting bigger and bigger

1. engagement ring deposit down
2. ceremony site reserved, need to send deposit
3. reception site deposit down
4. photographer deposit down, need to make engagment session
5. center pieces decided on
6. invitations decided on
7. programs rough idea 

Everything else we have disscused! According to the Knot, this month I have to start trying on wedding dresses. We also have to decide on a caterer and book a DJ. We know who we want for both already, we just have to see if they are both available for July 25. I really hope that they are."

"event","I feel like I have gotten alot of shit done today. Larry and I slept in a little late today, which was nice. We have both been so tired lately. We went into Northampton today and stopped at LaFloratinas. Yummy wedding cake! Then we also walked to Paradise Copies to see about our wedding invitations. They will probably be able to do them. I also emailed our photographer and set up an appointment with him on Friday.

I also cleaned out the hallway closet today. Finally we can use it. I also cleaned the bed room and did three loads of laundry. I also made dinner. The best thing is that I took out my work out videos and did one of them to start getting in shape for the wedding. 297 days to go!

I cannot wait! I am so happy that Larry and I are starting to reserve things. I feel like the stress from the wedding is going away already. The only things is that things at work are not great. Chivon and I are not talking at all. I do not really trust her at all right now. She really made me feel like shit this week.&nbsp;I have never felt this shitty about my job. It sucks. I didn't go in today for an extra day. I don't really want to do any extra shit right now. Although I really could use the money, I don't think that it is worth it.

Anyways, Larry heard from Brad today. He is working at Evergreen Solar, which is the place that Larry interviewed around the same time that he started working at Bombardier. I think that Larry is going to try to get a job with them again. I really hope he does because that will force me to figure out what I want to do about my job. If he does interview with them again, we will probably move out there.&nbsp;Before I was really nervous about it, but now I think I will be ok with it. I like Lauren and Brad. I think that if we were to move out there and they were there I would at least have someone that I knew.

Larry and I have been talking about buying a house alot lately. We both want to buy a house before the wedding.&nbsp;I&nbsp;am not sure if that is actually possible but I would like for it to happen. It would be really nice if Larry's family could stay with us when they come up for the wedding. We are just going to have to really work on our bills and keep our eyes out."

I also signed up for free gifts and drawings too. I was really excited about it. I think Larry was even excited too. We watched a fashion show and talked about what we would like to have at our wedding. <br /><br />I found out yesterday that the Garden House at Look Park is booked for the date that we wanted it. :( We are considering changing the date but we have to sit down and figure some things out. We are going to make a list of our top choices for things and see which dates they are available and then go from there. Maybe we will be able to get the vendors that we want. <br /><br />I am hoping that we will be able to put some deposits down soon, at least with our next pay checks. Both of us have been doing a great job paying off credit cards and both of us have extra money in our accounts now.<br /><br />I am really excited about our wedding. I cannot wait to marry Larry! I wanted to get married and have our reception at Look Park since that is where we spent most of our summer last year. If we do get our engagment photos done with Koloski, I am thinking that it&nbsp;would be nice to get them done ontop of Sugarloaf Mountain.&nbsp; I have so many idea running through my head!&nbsp;</p>"

"event","<p>So this week at Target is our peak week for back to college. The fucking stupid thing about it is that we had absolutely no payroll for this week. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday the team had to run on only two or three team members on the floor. It has sucked all week. I haven't gotten any tasks done at all this week. Thursday night I remerchandised RTW while I zoned it but I have an adjacency due next week anyway. I still have to set hosiery next week too. I don't even know how I will actually get any of it done.<br /><br />I also have found out that some of my team members have been upset with the fact that Nikki and I have been meeting with Chivon lately. They feel that we are meeting with her too much and that we are not helping out the closing team enough. I know that the team really meant me for the most part and that Chivon said that it was both me and Nikki. I don't know what to do though. I am really trying to be more global and help out other teams. I always cover the GSTL's breaks up front. That is one hour of my shift, then I have my own breaks to take which takes up another hour. Then if you throw in fitting room breaks, another 30 minutes or so. Also taking into account back up cashiering. I don't know. I really hate when my team is upset with me. <br /><br />I think I just hate when my team is upset in general. I kind of feel like Amanda has had something to do with all of this. I cannot help but feel like she has talked to some of the team members. Whatever. Also to make things even more stressful at work, I found out today that one of the team members there is suposedly calling the labor board. I guess, Chivon was supposed to talk to me today, but she never did. Dawn was the one who told me about it. I guess Sultana is going to call them because she feels discriminated against because she only has like one shift in softlines. What the Fuck??? Since I do the schedule for softlines, Chivon is talking to me about it. I am so pissed though. It is not all my fault. <br /><br />First- No one actually told me how long Sultana was supposed to be on our schedule.<br />Second- She is only available until 9pm. It doesn't really work for our team.<br />Third- I gave her more shifts in the earlier weeks because we had more hours.<br />Fourth- On the new schedule, we have team members with only one and two shifts also, so she is not the only one.<br />Fifth- She doesn't automatically come up in softlines, I have to locate her, and last week I had forgotten about her until I was just about done with the schedule, I let Erin know so she could put her on the cashier schedule, and she didn't. That is not my fault.<br /><br /><br />UGH!!! I get so stressed out at my job sometimes!!! I just feel like everything at work is falling apart. I don't like it. I want to be able to get everything organized and running smoothly again. I don't know how to make that happen though.<br /><br />Larry is looking for another job now. I hope he gets one close by and soon. We were looking at houses online today. I really want to buy a house someday soon. We have to save our money though for that to happen. We also have to start thinking about what we are going to do for our wedding... We haven't done anything for planning at all. According to the knot.com we are overdue on 5 things. I don't like seeing that, but we don't have any choice.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","&nbsp;I'm stressed out. Amanda only has four days left at Target. I don't think she is just going to leave without stirring up as much shit as she can. Her last scheduled week as been posted for over a week now and she just today gave Chivon a letter about it. She is upset that she is not scheduled at 5 am on that Sunday. Honestly the main reason that I did not schedule her at that time was because I really didn't think that she would even show up. I scheduled Jesse and Sarah to come in for 6 instead. She wrote Chivon a letter saying that she was planning on comming in for 5 am and that she would like to work her ""normal shift"". I will be so mad if Chivon lets her change her schedule. I know for a fact that she is going to either call out or just not show up for her Monday shift too. That is really going to suck because it was just going to be Nikki, Scott, and Amanda that night.

Also no one has told Amanda that they do not want to have her on Presentation either. I think she went to go talk to Erin about it today. I cannot believe that she even thinks that she should be given that chance. Whatever. I think the biggest thing that has pissed me off today is the stuff that Nikki brought up to Chivon and me.

Nikki told us today that she feels like Steven has an attitude around her. He gave her shit on Monday, I guess partly because Nikki was making him actually do his job. Also Nikki let us know about a conversation she had with Elisa. I guess Elisa said ""Don't take this the wrong was but there are alot of team members that are upset that you have taken Amanda's job"" Ok I have many issues with this! What the fuck people! Amanda is quitting!!! She put in her notice a long time ago! She did this to herself. She wanted to leave. Chivon and I did not force her to quit! In fact I tried on MANY occasions NOT to quit. I told her she was stupid. With that done, Chivon had to replace her sometime. She was not going to wait unil the day Amanda left to think about looking for another team leader. Plus Nikki came to our store over a month before Amanda even was planning on putting in her notice. We were trying to get her in the store as a third team lead in softlines. Of course Amanda is picking what she is telling everyone so that everyone feels sorry for her. I don't!!!! She is the fucking stupid one who is quitting a steady, decently paying job (considering she did not go to college) to help Caleb with his business, which from what I understand isn't going to well.

Sucks for her, I don't care what happens to her anymore. What I do care about though is the fact that some of our team members have this attitude about Nikki. I talked to Chivon about having a conversation with some of the team members to let them know what is going on. She thinks that we should. She also thinks that some of them will end not being with Target for one reason or another. Some of the team members are not too happy with me either I guess. Chivon has noticed that I am more strict and whatnot. I told her its because I know that I have the support of my peer now.&nbsp;

I cannot wait for the next two shifts that I have. I have to work with Amanda and Jeanne tomorrow and then Amanda and Nikki of Saturday. That will be kind of weird. I also have to have a conversation with Jeanne too with Chivon tomorrow. I don't even know if Amanda will even show up tomorrow. Prolly not, cause for the last month any time that Amanda would be working with me, she has called out with some ridiculous excuse.

I have a lot of write ups to do tomorrow. I also want to set 2 aisles in Hosiery, and if I have the time I want to work in RTW and fix some of the back racks. I have&nbsp;a lot on my plate tomorrow. I also heard that they may want me to go up to Lanesborrow too??? They wanted me to go today too I guess, but they didn't want to take me of the night schedule here. Oh well we will see how tomorrow goes..."

"event","&nbsp;I have been stressing out lately about money. Honestly Larry and I are doing great paying off bills and such. Living at my parents right now is helping with that. I get stessed though because I am not sure how much money my parents are really going to give us. I don't like asking them for money either. Larry and I really should be making our reservations for our reception and ceremony. We haven't done either because one, we haven't had any time to actually call and make appointments to view anything and two we don't actually have money that we can throw down to reserve anything. Larry and I haven't even had any time to bring his mothers ring to a jeweler. Any time that we have had any time, neither of us have any money. I know it's not a big deal, it is just a ring. He did buy me a ring for my birthday just over a week before he asked me to marry him. But he didn't buy it for that reason. I love him and I know we are getting married with or with out an engagement ring. I just want to be able to show my family and friends that I AM actually going through with this engagement. I don't know I feel like I am being selfish, maybe its because I have always been showed like every other girl in the world that when you are engaged, you are supposed to have a ring on your finger. Larry and I are not really like other couples, and I definately don't want us to change that. I just want to be able to show everyone that Larry loves me and still wants to marry me even though he knows about my past.&nbsp;

It really sucks, I had to take Monday and Tuesday off from work this week because I have to work on Saturday. Which is fine with me but I wish I could have just took the extra day. I really would like to work as much as possible so I can save up as much money as I can. I want Larry and I to be able to get things started with our wedding. I want us to be able to pay off as much of our debt as possible. I want us to be able to start saving money. I want us to be able to buy a house some day soon.&nbsp;

I really hope that Larry gets a job around here and soon. If he were to get a job farther away it would be the end of the world. I definately would go with him where ever he needed to go. But as much as I hate living at my parents house, I want to stay here as long as possible before the wedding so that we can buy a house instead of having to rent an apartment. It would also be nice if Larry got a new job that allowed him to work first shift instead of second. I have been so tired since he has started this job. I don't&nbsp; get to see him very often. Like tonight, I will be going to sleep soon because I have to work in the morning at 8. Larry will get home at like 1:30 and I will wake up and end up staying up with him for about an hour or so.

The other thing I have been stressed out about is the stupid storage shed situation. I just got a new one the other day and Larry and I will probably move our stuff on Thursday morning.&nbsp;But I am stessed because I know that I will end up paying more for the shed that what is in there is worth by the time we take it out. It is frusturating. I just don't want to bring it to my parents and have it get ruined or infested with fleas. But it is more money wasted that could be going to wedding stuff, bills, or a savings account.

Oh well there isn't much I can do about anything tonight, I might as well try to get some sleep before Larry gets home. I have a ton of crap I have to do in the morning at work....."

"event","&nbsp;Larry and I are getting married! I am so unbelievably happy with this! He has been so supportive and understanding through this past year. My parents love him!&nbsp;My dad mentioned something about going out to dinner to celebrate our engagement and my birthday. I think my dad really likes Larry. He knows that Larry loves me and would do pratically anything to make sure that I am happy and safe. He knows that Larry will take care of me and our family. That's right I have met the man that will be the father of my children!

Even though I think we are still too selfish to have our own children yet, I cannot wait till we do! Ever since Larry asked me to marry him, all I have been doing is thinking about our wedding. It's kind of weird, I used to want a big wedding, with a really fancy dress and all the expensive shit. With Larry it is different. I don't need all of that. I just want our families there, and for all of us to have a good time celebrating our marriage.&nbsp;

I love Larry. I am able to tell him that everyday. And its not the ""I love you"" habit where I say it whenever we are on the phone or anything like that. Everytime I say it, I truely mean it. He makes me happy. I think our relationship is something that we both have been looking for for a long time. I am able to talk to him about anything that bothers me, although sometimes he has to point out that something is bothering me first. He always makes things better, he knows about my past and he still loves me. I also know about his past, I still adore him.

I cannot wait to marry him. Sometimes I get scared that I will do the same thing and repeat my history. But Larry assures me that the third time is a charm. He is my Lucky Charm!"

"event","<p>I am going to marry Larry. I know I am. I have finally found the Mr. Right. He is not just Mr. Right Now or the guy to be with until he shows up. He is Mr. Right. He will be the father of my children. I love him. The best part of it is that he loves me too!&nbsp;<br /><br />We have been talking about getting married and having kids alot lately. I know that he is plotting something, I can only assume that he will ask me to marry him. Even if that is not what he is plotting, I am still going to marry this man. I will wait as long as it takes. Since our relationship has been far from normal, I was thinking of proposing to him. I am not going to. I really think that Larry wants to ask me.&nbsp;<br /><br />I think that one of the things that makes our relationship work is the fact that we do live together but since we work opposite shifts most of the time, we don't spend every minute together. We did for a little while since we both were at Target and that was ok but now it's even better to spend time with him since I don't get to all the time. We each get our own time to be on our own and we go out with friends and people from work without the other one. There is trust in this relationship, which after thinking about it, I didn't really have with past relationships. Larry knows about my past and I know about his.<br /><br />I actually have this weekend off! I am so excited. I wanted to go somewhere for the weekend too but I am not sure if that will be able to happen. I was thinking of taking a shift on Sunday night but I haven't had a whole weekend off in a while to spend with Larry. Plus it is Amanda's closing weekend and I don't really want to work with her anymore than I have to. Maybe I will look into the rooms at Foxwoods for the weekend. Or I can look into what movies are playing at the drive in and go there. We could take a day trip out to Hampton Beach. Maybe I can call out on Monday so that we can spend two days over there. Yeah, right. I wouldn't actually call out.<br /><br /></p>"

"event","tIt is still hot as hell. I went swimming in the pool earlier today. I haven't really done anything else. It has been way to hot to do anything. I have been looking online for ideas of what I want for a tattoo. I told Larry that I would go get one with him soon. I really want to get one but I am not sure what I actually want. I know that I want a unicorn and I think I want to get one of the Leo sign. I was thinking of getting the two together some how but i think that I will get them both. I think I want to get the unicorn on the top center of my back and the Leo sign on my hip or somewhere where it is not usually visible. Partly because I may still want to be a preschool teacher but it also works out because I won't have to listen to my father bitch. 

I hate that I don't see Larry that much anymore. It kind of sucks because I don't really hang out with any of my old friends anymore, since most of them were friends with Kevin too. So while Larry is at work, I stay home most of the time. Its not that bad because I don't spend much money but it makes the nights drag. I am not even sure what I would of actually done today since it was so crappy out today anyway. I was thinking of going swimming again but I wanted to wait till Larry came home since my parents will be asleep.&nbsp; 

I think it would be fun to go swimming at like 1 in the morning. We just have to be quiet so we don't wake up the neighbors. Since I don't have to work till 10 tomorrow night I think I will be sleeping late with Larry. I hope we can sleep well with the heat. 

I want to go buy an airconditioner. We are all out at Target and I am sure that other stores are all out as well.&nbsp;"

I haven't really gotten to spend that much time with Larry this week. get to see him Tuesday mornings before he goes to work and Thursday mornings before both of us go in to work. The thing that sucks is that since he gets home so late and ends up not going to sleep until like 3 or 4 in the morning he will usually sleep till like 10 or 11. I don't like waking him up because he looks so tired but I always end up waking him up somehow. I try to stay up to see him on Monday and Wednesday nights but I usually fall asleep. Although I have woken up shortly after he comes home everytime.</p><p>I haven't been feeling great lately. I think for like the last 3 weeks I have been complaining that I haven't been feeling well to Larry. I didn't realize how long it has been until he brought it up today. I know part of it is because of next week. I think it is getting worse though. Everything around me has been making me think of next week. I hate it so much! This time last year I was in Florida with Kevin, talking about our honeymoon that was going to be in Disney. And this time next week I would have been not sleeping because I would be getting married in the morning. I hate how I have been feeling lately. I guess that it is kind of good that I haven't seen Larry that much this past week. I slept so much on Monday and Tuesday. I just didn't feel like doing anything.</p><p>I just have one more week to go and than maybe I can be done with this whole ""feeling sorry for myself"" phase that I seem to be going through. It's just that everything lately seems to be making me think about my ""wedding"". Seeing Aubrey alot lately, driving by Wycoff and Zoe's today, seeing all kinds of previews for wedding type movies, songs on my cd's that were possible 1st songs. This was all today alone! UGH!!! I am such a defect when it comes to this shit.</p><p>I am so happy with Larry. I can't say that enough. He really makes me feel good. I love when he comes to see me at work. I can be having a shitty day and when I see him I just get this calming, happy feeling. All he has to do is just be in front of me. Hell even when he calls me at work to say hi, I am in a better mood. All of my team members notice it too. Larry told me the other day that I make him happy. I am so glad that I do. He also told me that it scares him sometimes how happy he is.</p><p>I am terrified. I am so terrified that I am going to fuck something up with him. My track record is not the best. I always seem to fuck up something. I guess I am a little relieved that Larry is scared too, because I don't have to feel so dumb. I don't want to lose him, I am going to hold on tight and I am not letting go. I think I have finally met the guy that I am supposed to spend my life with. He is at least the guy that I am supposed to spend a long time with anyway. I love him. That may terrify me, because of my track record but I am admitting it to myself now. He has been amazing and I will eventually have to admit this to him in person, and verbally instead of in writing. I just don't know when I will be able to admit it. Hopefully before he reads this.</p>"

"event","I&nbsp; had a job interview today. It kind of just came up. I was called into Shaun's office with Chivon on Thursday night. They told me how there is a Senior Team Lead opening in Winsor. They wanted me to interview for it. Then they told me that I would have to be there Friday at 12:30 for the interview. I had to close Thursday night so that didn't give me any time to prepare for it.

I went to the interview today. I was really nervous. I was thinking about it the whole night before. I didn't get any sleep. I changed my schedule for today and instead of opening I told them that I would close so that I could go to the interview. The drive down there wasn't that bad, the store was pretty easy to find. The store is set up like Torrington. I interviewed with the STL- Allen, the ETL-HR Tyron, and another ETL whose name I can't even remember anymore. After all of my interviews, Joe Franco came in to talk with me too. He was the STL that ran the planorama in Torrington. He didn't remember me from then. Obviously I didn't make much of an impression on him since he doesn't remember me.&nbsp;

I really don't think that I will get this position. I know that I should be positive but I am being realistic. I wasn't planning on moving up this quickly. I have not been able to develope in Hadley yet.&nbsp;I may have larger areas to be in charge of but as for leadership...not so much. My store doesn't have the team leads run the whole zones at night. I only run Softlines. It kind of sucks because this job in Winsor would have be so perfect. I would be working close to where Larry works, so we could move even closer. It was a Senior over Softlines which is what I am waiting for. It would be a new store so I wouldn't feel held back with my development by the other team leads. The store is very close in sales/payrole as Hadley. Plus I know some of the people that work there.

Oh well. It was a great learning experience. Now I know what kind of questions that I will be asked next time and I can be more prepared. I think that I am going to sit down with Chivon and Shaun next week and get an IDP ready and start working on my development. I am not going to care what the other team leaders will say. I have to think about what I want. I am also going to look into going back to school soon too. I have to figure out what I have to do."

I woke up from my nap at 6:00. I was so mad too because I was going to go out to buy Larry something, but by the time I woke up from my nap it was too late.<br /><br />I don't know&nbsp; what it is, all I have been doing lately is sleeping. I always feel so tired. I guess it doesn't help that I have been feeling nausous lately. It sucks.&nbsp; My stomach just feels uneasy all the time. I thought that maybe it was just the fact that I went to Six Flags on Saturday. But my stomach has been like this for a while now. I don't know.<br /><br />I can't wait until Larry and I get our own place. I think that it will be so much easier. He will be getting home at like 1:30 tonight. I tried waiting up for him last night but I fell asleep. I did wake up when he got home though. We watched some tv. Tonight I won't be able to stay up with him though because I have to work at 7:00. I think our own place will definately help out with that. Since he will be able to watch tv or play a video game when he gets home and not wake me. It's not really an issue now, but I do wake up when he comes in the room. That is nice though.<br /><br />I have to remember to RSVP to Aubrey's wedding this week. I cannot wait to go! Aubrey told me that Sarah will be up this weekend too. I have to work the mornings this weekend but hopefully we will be able to go out Friday or Saturday night for drinks or something.&nbsp;<br /><br />I was also thinking that since I get out of work at 1:30 on Sunday, maybe Larry will want to do something Sunday afternoon. I know he will want to do something but Im not sure what. I was thinking maybe going to Six Flags again, so he can go on the Superman ride again. But I don't know when the park closes and if&nbsp; it will be worth it.. Maybe we can go out to dinner with Jesse on Sunday night since we didn't get to do our payday dinner last Friday.<br /><br /></p>"

"event","I&nbsp;found out today that Kevin is engaged. I am mad at myself for the reaction that I&nbsp;had. I was&nbsp;actually pretty upset about it. I don't even really know why. I don't want to marry Kevin or be with him. I am just upset because I&nbsp;feel like there is something wrong&nbsp;with me.&nbsp;Kevin and Sarah&nbsp;have only been together for&nbsp;2 months. Larry and I have been together for 7-10 months and we are not getting married anytime soon. My parents got engaged only after dating for 2 weeks and they are still together and happy so maybe Kevin and&nbsp;Sarah&nbsp;will too.

I hate that I am being so girly and stupid right now. I&nbsp;have been like this for like the last&nbsp;month. It is retarded.&nbsp;I just don't understand.&nbsp;All I have been thinking about tonight is ""When will I finally get my chance"" I miss planning my&nbsp;wedding and my honeymoon. I thought that if I&nbsp;could plan a trip to Florida with Larry that&nbsp;it would&nbsp;help&nbsp;keep my mind off the whole wedding thing, but that never happened.&nbsp;

Larry really is an awesome guy. I keep wondering if this relationship that we have (as abnormal that it is)&nbsp;is ""the one"".&nbsp;The one that I have always waited for.&nbsp;I wonder if/when I do get asked that question again,&nbsp;what&nbsp;will it be like. Is&nbsp;it going to&nbsp;be a spur of the moment type thing, or will it be an elaborate plan. Will it be something that is discussed a lot&nbsp;before we just decide that we are getting married.&nbsp;All I do know is that it is not going to happen anytime in the near future. I can't even say the ""L&nbsp;word"" in the right sentence around him. I feel that it is there but I am&nbsp;so afraid&nbsp;of what happens when that word is spoken. I don't even know if I am more afraid of his reaction or what that would mean for me.

How retarded is this? I am writing in&nbsp;an online journal about how terrified I am about saying I love you to my boyfriend. The&nbsp;most retarded part of this is that I know that&nbsp;he is the only&nbsp;one&nbsp;who&nbsp;reads this stupid thing now. I guess I am&nbsp;just using this journal to vent sometimes&nbsp;but it seems like&nbsp;most of the time I am writing in here when I&nbsp;have something&nbsp;that I want&nbsp;Larry to know, but I am too afraid to tell&nbsp;him&nbsp;in person. Maybe just afraid of seeing a reaction that I don't want. I don't know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","I just got home from work. We&nbsp;were all really burned out tonight. About 9:00 we were all talking about how we wanted to get&nbsp;out&nbsp;early.&nbsp;Heather and I decided to team up to make things go faster. We only got&nbsp;out&nbsp;ten minutes early but at least&nbsp;we got a lot of the reshop done so the morning crew doesn't have to worry about it. Oh yeah, I'm part of the morning crew.&nbsp;That's right, instead of having tomorrow off like I was originally supposed to, I decided to work. I&nbsp;need the&nbsp;money&nbsp;and I have stuff to take care of anyway. This will end&nbsp;up putting me at ten days in a row though. At least I have the weekend off.

My whole body is so sore. It just feels so drained. I guess it doesn't help that I had two RedBulls at work tonight to try to give me energy. I also finished the&nbsp;bottle of wine Larry bought the other day&nbsp;before I went to work. ( I went to work feeling pretty good) But now I cannot sleep, and I have to work in the morning. What a smart&nbsp;idea&nbsp;to drink RedBull tonight and then agree to come in for 7:00. Ugh...

Larry makes the weirdest noises when&nbsp;he is asleep.&nbsp;I wonder if I make weird noises too. I probably do. Sometimes though if he&nbsp;is asleep when I get home,&nbsp;and making the noises, I can't fall asleep. I sometimes&nbsp;put my hand gently on his chin to make him stop, which helps but he does it again a few minutes later.

Man, I am so hungry! I didn't really&nbsp;eat anything today. I didn't really have any time. Well&nbsp;I guess I did have the time, but I was&nbsp;reading my&nbsp;book. Then at work, I just munched on the Doritos and candy to get me by.&nbsp;By the time my lunch came, I didn't feel hungry so I didn't eat. It is too late now to eat anything. I think I will have to stop at Dunkin Donuts in the morning. I haven't stopped at all this week, so I think&nbsp;I can treat myself tomorrow morning.

Well I&nbsp;guess I should try to get some sleep, I think I will read a chapter in my book first. That&nbsp;should help make&nbsp;me a little tired.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","&nbsp;I just got the mail. I got a wedding invitation to Aubrey's wedding in July. Although I am really excited to go to a wedding and se her and Sarah I can't help to feel...down or something. I am so unbelievably happy where my relationship is with Larry. We are at a great point and things are great between us. I don't want to change that, and I definitely don't want to go back to my previous relationship with Kevin. I cannot stress that enough! But I still cannot help the fact that I feel like I am just retarded!&nbsp;

I kind of knew that I would start to think of my ""wedding"" as it got closer to the date, but this is bordering on obsession/insane craziness. I don't even know. I think it first started when Matt told me about Jenny and Ed. I don't even really know Jenny all that well and Ed I haven't really talked to since Matt and I were together. But when I found out that they called off their wedding the day before it was supposed to happen, I couldn't help but to feel so upset about it to the point where I actually could feel myself holding back tears.

I have been seeing Aubrey at work alot in the last few months. She had&nbsp;come in with her son a couple times. Every time I see her I start to feel really jealous. The last time that I saw her, she wanted to get my address so that she could send me her wedding invitation. It is so weird because, Sarah, Aubrey and I were all best friends in high school but we had our moments of jealousy and hatred towards each other. It was like we were all constantly competing against each other, Aubrey and I mostly. We never really talked about it but it was there. It was like whenever one of us told the other about something really good happening in our lives the other felt like they had to match that or go about and beyond that.

It is so frustrating because I feel like I make Larry mad when I think about this crap. I care about him so much I think that we could be talking about the forbidden ""L"" word here. But I just feel like everytime I tell someone that I love them that it jinxes the relationship. Larry and I don't have what people see as a normal relationship, we have ""our"" relationship. I don't want to ruin the good thing that we have by being stupid. I already warned him about me talking about the ""wedding"". I just feel like it keeps getting worse as the time gets closer.&nbsp;

Sometimes I want to talk to Kevin just to see if he is doing the same thing. Just because maybe I won't feel so retarded if I wasn't the only one doing this stupid shit. I was thinking of talking to Rachel because she is the only friend that has been through the same type of thing. I think it would be weird to talk to her about it though. I don't know.

All I know is, I don't want to drive Larry away. I don't want him to feel like I want him to ask me to marry him, I don't want us to move any faster than we already have. I want him to stick around. I don't want to scare him away.&nbsp;

I guess since Larry is really the only one who reads this, I am writing to him. So, Larry, I want you to stick around, and I don't want to change anything (except where we live) any time soon.&nbsp;

Well enough ""wedding"" talk. Time to go to work.

I went to work today thinking that it was going to be a pretty good night with a bunch of team members. Well that changed pretty quickly. Once I got there I found out that I had a call out and a team member whose shift was deleted off the schedule all together. I was a little stressed since I had two newer team members on with me tonight. I also ended up having another call out later in the night. I&nbsp; went from having eight people to close to only five, which is the bare minimum for a Monday night never mind a Saturday night. UGH. MY team did an awsome job tonight though. We were able to get all of our zones done and work out a good chunk of the reshop. Oh yeah since it was a Saturday I also had Ad takedown to do. I did most of it while covering the fitting room.</p><p>Anyways, the reason that Larry is the most amazing guy is because when I came home he was waiting for me with a glass of wine, Elvis and candle light. He always seems to know when I need something like that. Just kissing him and being in his arms tonight just made me melt. I know I'm being girly again. I don't care though! I'm am so happy right now, and nothing can change that tonight.</p><p>Larry got his first paycheck from his new job today. He was quite happy with it. I guess it was more than what he was expecting. He also got his stimulus check this week too. Now he is going to jump ahead of the paying off bills. I should be getting my stimulus check next week. I also get paid this Friday too. I want to pay off some credit cards, but I also really need to get Sally tuned up. She is not running like she used to.

Work was alright tonight, it was your normal Friday night crowd being stupid. Larry came to see me for my lunch again today. I was really happy to see him since we were working the opposite schedules the last two days. He brought me lunch from Chili's too. He's such a great guy!

I saw Aubrey at work today. She had her son with her, he is so cute! She is getting married the first weekend of July. I wasn't sure if she was going to invite me to the wedding with everything that has happened between us, but today she did ask me for my address. So I hope that means that I have a wedding to go to in July. It is so weird that I will be the last one of my friends to get married. Sarah is married living in Deleware. Katelyn was married and living in Hatfield, but she is now divorsed. Adam is married, has a son, and is living in Easthampton. Mike is married too. It is just so crazy to me. I feel so old!

I just can't wait to be out of this house. Seamus caught another mouse tonight. That makes THREE since he has been here! It disgusts me to think that there are mice running around in this house. At least all three times he has caught the mice I have either been asleep so I don't even realize it happened, or I'm not home all together. I don't know what he will do when Larry and I have our own place with no mice for him to catch.

Larry and I are going to the bank tomorrow. Larry will be opening a checking account out here. I guess that means he plans on staying out here for the time being. I am happy about that. I am not sure if I was ready to make the step to move to Michigan with him, just yet. Plus his new job will help us get a place sooner... I hope. We are also going to stop at the storage shed to put some more of our stuff in there.

I wish I had the weekend off so I could spend some more time with Larry. He seemed so tired this past week. I think the drive to CT everyday is taking a toll on him. I hope when we move to Westfield it will help with the drive, although it will double my drive to work. I honestly won't care though, as long as I can be with him and be out of here I will be happy.

Well I think I am going to try to get some sleep."

"event","&nbsp;So I am kind of annoyed. Larry and myself are not messy people. We are actually neat freaks. But no matter what we do we cannot keep our bedroom clean. Since we are living in my parents house so we can pay off some of our debt, we have just one foom in the house to put all of our shit. It is not that our room is all&nbsp;that messy it is just clutered, but it annoys me because of the rest of the house.

I know that Larry hates living here. I do too. Last month we spent our Saturday night off cleaning my parents kitchen. Which was so disgusting! You can't even really tell anymore. I have a storage shed in Easthampton which I would love to get rid of, since I am payinf 90 dollars a month for it! My father keeps asking me why I need to have it and I just want to tell him because I don't want any of my and Larry's nice stuff to be in this shit hole of a house! It's frusturating because yes, I would like to put that 90 dollars toward paying off mor of my credit cards, but I don't want to have my stuff get ruined here.

What my father doesn't realize either is that I am planning on moving out this summer some time. He is going to be upset again because I will be renting which is a waste. I fully understand this, but i don't think that Larry and I are at the point to buy a home together. We are just so ready to get out of here. I am going to make sure that I am paying off as much of my debt as I can as quick as possible. Even if that means that I won't be able to go out as much. I won't really be doing all that much with Larry working nights anyways.

That and my parents keep asking me about my mom's cell phone. Ok first of all, she lost it while she was at Foxwoods. They go religiously every weekend! Maybe if they didn't go so often she might have the phone. Plus, I always have to ask for the cell phone money every month. It is always the same amount and it is always due the same time of the month. They are the ones who get the mail and see when the bill arrives. You would think that they would have the money to me without me asking for it. I don't like asking them for the money.&nbsp;

It also makes me mad that when Kevin and I broke up, his phone was on my family plan. Well he got his own plan and gave me the phone. Well my parents just assumed that I was just going to give the phone to my grandfather (who never even used the phone he had) I was going to ahve Larry have the line so that he could get rid of his cell phone bill! Now I have 5 lines on my family plan and my parents pay for 3 of the lines. That's right I have my cell phone to pay for&nbsp;plus since my parents only pay for a third of the bill I end up paying for my brothers phone. UGH!!!

I really need to just get the hell out of here! At least it is about that time to go to work. It is sad that I am actually looking foward to work on a Friday night!"

"event","&nbsp;So I'm not sure how I decided to log back into this again but for some reason I did. I came home from work tonight and couldn't sleep so I went on the computer. It has been five years since my last post on here. So much has changed in my life since then too! I read a lot of my old entries tonight and it is weird to think of everything that has happened. I have been engaged two times, and the guy I am with now isn't even one of the guys I was engaged to. Sometimes I think that I am just not supposed to get married. It sucks because although I am still good friends&nbsp;
with Matt, I hardly ever get to talk to him. Kevin and I broke up in August and never talk anymore. Kevin and I were going&nbsp;to be married a month from now. It was a good thing that we broke up, we both were just not happy.&nbsp;Kevin and I have both since moved on. We are both happy too. I guess I just am thinking about it because it would only be a month way. I will admit, I miss planning a wedding, looking at dresses and cakes and going to bridal shows. Don't get me wrong, I am incredibly happy with my life now and the guy that I am with. Who knows maybe some day, I will marry him and start a family with him. I just want to make sure that my next attempt down the aisle actually happens and that I am going to be happy.


Larry is really an amazing person. He really lets me be the bitch that I know I am. I don't have to make excuses for why I am the way I am. He is so smart too. He is such a history nerd and I love it!&nbsp; I am so happy that Larry has a new job. He seems to be so much happier now! He really hated working at Target, and I have to say even though I miss seeing him at work, I am happier that he doesn't work there anymore. I think it takes away some of the stress between us. It's nice to know that we could possibly have our own place in a couple of months. We already have so much stuff too.&nbsp;I guess the only thing that really sucks is that he will be working 2nd shift. I hope that after working for this new place for a little bit he will be able to move to days.

It is my closing weekend at Target this weekend. I actually have a good size team all three nights. Provided that no one calls out. I am actually happy that I am closing this weekend. I used to close the same weekend as Larry when he worked at Target but he will be off this weekend from his job. That will suck to know that Larry is home while I am at work. I will at least get to spend time with him in the mornings. We are planning on making a yummy breakfast on Saturday. It is going to be weird at work this weekend too since this is the week that we are starting the remodel of the store. Tonight I had to condense out some of the mens department to make room for two aisles of hardlines to come over. I am excited to see how our new set up will be. I am upset that Farai will be on overnights for the remodel though. I really liked working on his weekend. He stresses me out sometimes but I really look up to him as a manager.

I have next weekend off and Larry does too. Next week is his last week on days training before he goes to nights. I really want to go some where for the weekend. I think it would be nice to leave when he gets home after work on Friday and go to Hampton Beach or something. Im not sure if we will want to spend the money since we are trying to pay off some of our debt but its an idea."

"event","Today was a good day until Matt and I went to his parents. We stayed in bed until 11 or so and did the eating and showering thing. When we were done with that we started cleaning our room. That was ok, while we weere doing that, we made a list of stuff we needed to get at WalMart. When we left for the day, we stopped at the gas station down the road to get gas. While I was in the car a huge bee flew in and wouldn't leave, so Matt and I went in the store and got some drinks to give the bee time to fly out. I guess he did. Matt and I stopped at WalMart to get our list of stuff. We ended up getting more stuff though! Oh well. We also cashed some checks of ours and got Subway to eat. YumYum! Anyways, we brought our bathing suits with us, so we could use his parents hot tub while we were at their house. So we started doing our laundry and talked to Pepe. He told us that Melissa was picking up Pepper today to put her down. We didn't really pay much attention to him then, cause he's old, and went in the hot tub.
When Matt's parents came home, his dad WAS going to put his new cd player in his car, but they decided that they should get a wire kit so it would work better. Now Matt has to wait until Saturday to get his CD player now. 
Ever since last Saturday, (the 17) Pepper has be in the basement with Pepe. She couldn't even walk around. Pepe put an old sweatshirt around her back end so when she wanted to move he could hld up her back legs for her to walk. It was horrible to see that poor dog just laying down there today. She couldn't even get up. Melissa came over at like 6 today, and her husband had to carry Pepper upstairs and into their car. He walked past Matt and me in the living room and Pepper looked so sad. I had to hold back tears so Ashley wouldn't see me. I think I was more worked up about it than Matt was.
He deals with shit so much better than me. I was crying on the way hime tonight. I've only known this dog for like a year and a half. I called my mom to tell her and we talked about my grandma's dog that was put down two years ago and that worked me up more. I keep thinking of Sarah's poor kitten.
Oh yeah, I never talked about this yet. Sarah's little kitten Poe, has a broken leg. You know why? Because her little brother go mad at the cat for scratching him, and threw it on the ground! They might have to per her to sleep if the break is too bad. She's only 6 months old too. At least pepper was 14 years old. I couldn't believe Jeff did that. If that ws my kid, he would pay for all the vet bills. I would make him work around the house!
Anyways, enough of that. Mike passed his license test today. He also started work today. That's really good for Matt and me.

Matt and I have our astronomy final tomarrow. We haven't studied for it. We don't feel like it. We also have to work Wednesday and Thursday. I actually want to cause I will be in Layaway. I actually WANT to work. I can't believe it! Friday we have off, so we WANT to go to Six Flags but it might rain so we're not sure.
Anyways, Im off to watch a movie with Matt....."

"event","Matt and I both had to work today, (7-4). It wasn't that bad. When we got out of work we stopped at my parents house. The kittens have gotten soooo much bigger! Matt and I have decided that when they are ready to leave Kayci that we will either take the black one or the gray one, which ever one is a male. They are so cute! Matt's parents and my parents are each keeping a kitten so that means there is only one that I have to convince my parents to keep too!
Anyways, Matt and I also went to his parents house to get our hair cut. (I just got mine dyed) I actually like the color! Matt's parents said they will have a date set for our vacation really soon. I am so excited about that.
Matt and I have all these plans, we're going to Six Flags on Friday, to get season passes, then on the 31st we're going to Look Park with Shannon, then on the 2nd we're going back to Six Flags to see Simple Plan! Yeah, Matt can finally be happy! Then I July we have all kinds of family picnics to go to on both sides and July 14-17, Matt and I are house/dog sitting for my gradmother in Florence! That's gonna be the best thing, cause my humma (as I call her) is making me potato salad for while we're there! Plus, since Matt and I plan on buying that house in a year or two, it will be a good experience living there for a couple days too. Also Hampton Beach for a week with Matt's Parents and then my birthday in August. I think I will have a party for that just because I can. Matt and I have so much to do this summer!
We have decided that when Ray and Brian do move out, that the basement will be turned into another room with a TV and other entertainment stuff. I told him that we are definately buying that cat tree for Lucy and Ricky and putting it right by the stairs. I can't wait to see Ricky try to climb that thing! We're also probably going to move our fish tank downstairs. We have to buy a filter for the kitchen so we can get better water for that tank. No matter what we do, that tank is still green! 
We also decided that we will take either mine or his futon from our parents house and put it in the basement for when we have guest over, they can have a bed to sleep in.
I feel so bad for Matt, he's been so upset lately, with Ray treating him like shit and his car being broken into and all his shit being stolen, he hasn't been in a good mood. I'm trying to be the supportive girlfriend, we took a walk around the apartments today, and we just talked about what he was feeling like. I felt so awful. He just wants this whole thing over with. He's been put in the middle for long enough. I won't let Ray do this to him anymore! Brian at least grew up and wrote him a note to tell him that he was sorry for pretty much being a shitty friend. Brian and I still are not talking but at least Matt and Brian sort of are. I will not let Ray treat Matt like this. Matt has been such a good friend to Ray and he just throws his friendship out just like that, just because he hates me. Well he's gonna have to grow up pretty fast! It makes me so mad to see how upset this makes Matt and to see Ray not even care. Matt even said before, ""if you stop talking to people you get mad at, you'll end up being pretty lonely."" That is exactly what Ray will end up doing to himself. He gets mad at people if they can't hang out with him because they had other plans. I just think that its really shitty that Ray blames this on me....If Ray was Matt's REAL friend, he would still be his friend even if he hates me. My mom keeps telling Matt and me, when you fall in love, you find out who your TRUE friends are. I guess Ray isn't one of Matt's then huh? I hate to say this, but I think he's just jealous that Matt has found someone to love him as much as I love him. Before it was him and Matt without the girlfriends, now its just Ray. I'm not trying to be mean right now, so before anyone jumps down my throat, I'm just saying that Ray wants what Matt has. Ray just has TOO high of standards...."

"event","I have been doing a lot of thinking, and I have decided that contrary to what everyone else thinks, I do not hate Brian or Ray. I am still upset about the whole situation that happened but I don't think I should hate them. The only people I truely hate are mostly people like Courtney, and Christina and others who were really mean to me the whole time I knew them. Brian used to be like my best friend. We don't talk anymore, but I don't hate him. Ray and I got really close the first two or three months that we lived here. That was good, but it's over. I just want to let anyone know who actually reads this that I do NOT hate anyone who lives in the apartment right now. I don't even know if anyone will even read this, but I feel like this should be here just in case someone comes across it.
I also want to let people know that I did not blow up the way I did only because of some stupid pictures of my cats. That would be pretty pathetic. There was soooo much more to it. Ray and I were not getting along very well for the month before, and that night I was pushed and pushed. I don't even think Ray realizes that he was upsetting me the whole night, because if he did I really think he would have stopped. Ray is not a mean person, I pushed him as much as he pushed me. Plus the fact that people who shouldn't have gotten involved in the first place(Mego), did, and that pushed both of us even more.
Now that I got that out in the open I would also like to say that Matt is a really great friend. I think that if for some strange reason, Ray or Brian EVER read this, they should know that Matt was sticking up for them the whole night and that they shouldn't take this out on him. I think he's more upset about this than he let's anyone, even me know. 
Part of me thinks that moving in with Brian and Ray was a mistake. Matt and I are a very happy couple, we have been for awhile. I would do anything for him and he would do the same for me. I feel bad that Ray and Brian don't have the same thing we do. I think that sort of upset them seeing us together all the time. Matt and I love each other no matter what, and we love our friends. Ray and Brian may not be MY friends anymore, but Matt would like to think that they are still his. I just hope they won't ignore him much longer, because it's not fair to him. If they were his TRUE FRIENDS than they would understand why he stayed in the bedroom with me that night. He didn't want me going down to Ray's room to do anything more that I would regret. He wanted me to stop yelling at his friends. 
Anyways, speaking of Matt and yelling, he's bitching at me to work on my paper...so off I go."

"event","Why do I always find myself updating my journal every time I'm supposed to be work on English papers? Yeah, I have a big research paper due on Friday for English, it's 25% of my grade. I'm not that worried about it, I have enough information to write, now I just have to actually write it.
Anyways, I just wanted to say one thing before I go on with my update. I really think Brian and Ray are being unfair to Matt. I know they hate me and don't want to talk of live with me, which is fine cause I think it's best. But they won't even talk to Matt. I think that is really shitty. If they were really Matt's friends, they wouldn't let what I did and said to them get between their friendship. If they heard what Matt was saying to me that night, they wouldn't be acting this way. Matt was sticking up for them even though he was just as pissed at what Ray did.
Now that I've said that, I would like to say that Matt and I did find new roommates. No offense to Brian and Ray, I think our new roommates will be easier to live with only because they are a couple that have been dating almost as long as Matt and I have been. Living with them, Matt and I can actually be a couple and not feel bad. Plus they love our cats. BIG BIG plus.
Oh yeah, When Matt and I were leaving for school yesterday, we found that his car had been broken into and his CD player was stolen. We were pissed. The police came down, and checked it out. He also wanted our roommates information, because Ray came home after us, and Brian left really early in the morning.I guess they want to know if they maybe seen anything. Ray's car was parked right next to ours, but nothing happened to his. As far as we know Matt's car was the only one that was broken into. We also realized later that about 70 cd's were taken out of his car too. Whoever did it also tried to get Matt's rear speakers, but Matt had the last laugh, there were no speakers and his cd player was a piece of shit, and he was planning on getting a new one this summer. The thing is though we think it had to have been someone who lives here (at Southwood) because they knew Matt's door didn't lock right and his alarm didn't work. The red light was still on, but they went in anyways. I personally think his car was targeted, because whoever did this wouldn't have only done one car, no one else's car were hit either, MY car doors were unlocked, but no one went into my car. We told the leasing office about it, so if anyone else gets hit they know that it is not the first time it happened.
I couldn't sleep last night, I just sat in bed listening for someone to come back and try to break in to another car. I feel like it was my fault that this happened, I wanted to catch the bastards that did this. I keep telling people that I hope it was Ray or Brian, playing a game like paying me back, cause then that way Matt will get his stuff back, but I know they wouldn't be that stupid, I don't even think they would even know how to do something like that.
Last night at work Aubrey was trying to cheer up Matt. He told me that after last night he really considers Aubrey a true friend. That makes me feel good about her moving in with us. My parents also came in to make him feel better too. They bought him his favorite cd that happened to be in his cd player when it was taken. I think that made him feel good. That makes me happy to know that my parents really like Matt. If this was Jon they would have called him an idiot and made fun of him!
Anyways enough slacking, time for me to actually do some work on my paper!"

"event","There has ben a few changes since I last updated this thing. Last weekend, my roomates decided to have a party at the apartment. Which was fine. But Ray ended up getting drunk and ripped pictures of my cats. I got really mad, about that and about all the other stuff that has been happening for the last month. Anyways, I went nuts, and tore apart the whole apartment. I even dumped kitty litter on the kitchen floor. Ray's friends that were there at the time kept getting involved which pissed me of even more. The cops were called the next morning, my keys were hidden from me and they hid all of the alcohol. Ray told me that I was going to move out. The cop told me that there was no way for Ray to kick me out of the apartment because my name was on the lease. So Ray doesn't want to live with me and the cats, and I won't move out because Matt and I found this place and put all of the effoert into getting it. So Ray says he will mov out. I am not sure about Bran though, he locks hiself in his bedroom and won't talk to anyone except Ray, which I have no problem with, cause that means no more fighting. Anyways, Matt and I are waiting for one of our friends to get back to us on moving in to take the place of Ray and Brian (if he does move out). 
Enough of that shit, I hate talking about it now, I keep telling Matt that I can't wait till they move out, not just for me but so they can go back to normal again. 
Matt and I have been going out alot lately. Aubrey , Mike, Matt, and I all went out to Kahunaville this weekend, that was really fun. Matt and I have been having alot of fun lately.
My cousin Richie is coming up soon! He just told me that he will be up tomarrow sometime. I'm really excited, cause I haven't seen him in a while. He will be the first of my mom's side to meet Matt! That makes me really happy. Richie might be bringing Humma up to visit sometime this week. I miss my mom's family, they are really fun to be around. I can't wait till Matt meets all of them!
Well I think Im gonna get going, Richie just got offline, he'll be up tomarrow, big day! I have to get up early!"

Matt and I saw a car accident on our way into work yesterday. Some truck rear-ended another car. The car got pushed into the other lane and drove off the main road. I was pretty freaked out about it, cause we were right behind the truck. 
I am supposed to be writing a paper for psychology right now, but I can't get into doing it. I'm hoping that the sme thing will happen this time that happened last time. I took a break from my English paper to update and when I went back I had no problem finishing it. I'm not sure if it will work though. Oh well.
The Roomates and I went shopping for food the other night. We finally have a whole kitcen filled with all kinds of food. That makes me really happy. I think if I don't go into work tonight, I will cook a good dinner for all the guys. I think that would be nice. Maybe Ray will help me. I enjoyed when we cooked last time together. 
I really like living with the guys. I get along with them so well. We don't see much of Brian that much cause he's the department manager at Wal*Mart, but it's not that bad. His birthday is comming up soon, I have to start thinking of what to get him. I think he would like to have a blow up doll. Well I'm gonna try to work on my paper now. Wish me luck!

"event","Well I'm at my parents house right now. I'm supposed to be working on my English paper that is due Monday, but I can't get into doing it right now, so I'm taking a break from it. 
I had a pretty good day yesterday. I went in to work for 7 to open the cafe. That was cool cause there were no customers for like the first hour or so, so I got to be pretty much on my own. I finally got to take a lunch at 1 when Dennis came in. Matt and I went to my parents to eat. We got out of work at 4 which was really good cause we had all night to do whatever. We actually didn't leave WalMart till almost 5, cause we went shopping. Then we went to my parents to pick up our laundry. I tried convincing my parents to come visit the apartment later that night. At first they said that they had too much to do. I just left it at that and went home to get some work done. 
When Matt and I got home I was pretty cranky. I drove home on the highway, and the people there were making me so mad, so when we came home, I went upstairs and took a little nap. When Brian came home, he woke me up and I was still cranky, but that changed soon cause my parents showed up and they hung around for a little while. I was really happy to see them. Ray came home soon after my parents left and Ed came over. The guys played Risk while I was upstairs writing my paper.
I was really happy to have my parents to finally see the apartment. Matt was happy to hang out with Ed and Brian left me alone while he was playing with the guys, so it all worked out. 
I told Matt that we should hang out with Ed more often cause he's a lot cooler than Dave. I hate him. Well before I go on a ""I hate Dave"" write-a-thon, I'm gonna use this to my advantage, and get writing on my paper."

"event","I had such an awsome weekend! Saturday, started off not that good cause I had to work, but that turned better when I found out that WalMart fired the cafe manager that morning! I was so happy cause she never did any work and always got away with it cause she would blame it on the other people who worked in there. I had to cover her shift though. That was ok. 
After work Matt and I went home. Ray and Brian went to Ashley's party. I think it was good for them to go, they seem like they had a really good time. Matt and I stayed home and had Jon and Rachel come over. That was cool to hang out with them.
Sunday, Ed came over and hung out for a while. I played on the computer for part of the time he was there. The guys were watching the Sunday Night Sex Show, so I went down to watch it with them. That was pretty cool.
Monday morning we didn't have school. Matt and I didn't have to work either. That was fun. Brian came home early and Ray called out cause of the snow. Matt and Ray went to pick up Ed at like 1:00 and didn't get back till after 5:00. It took them so long to get home cause Ray's car wouldn't start at Ed's house. When they got home Ray and I cooked lasagna. IT was pretty damn good too. Brian was gone even before we sat down to eat. He had to be cut off. He kept trying to steal my drinks. The guys kept trying to get me to take shots with them but I kept chickening out. Ed finally got me to take a shot of Peachtree. That was a mistake, it was so easy so I ended up taking shots of AfterShock and Captian Morgan. I got pretty wasted that night. Ed had to help me up the stairs to go to the bathroom. Later that night I couldn't even stand up without the aid of someone else, the room was spinning really fast. I had alot of fun though. I liked talking to Ed, we got along alot better than I get along with Dave. The guys told Matt that he had such a cool girlfriend. That made me feel really good. Ed even called me a ""ccol chivk"". 
Once I crached on the couch for an hour or two, I turned into mother mode. It was funny though cause I was still stumbling. I made Ed more to the bigger couch and gave him a pillow and a blanket. I was suck a dork. 
Brian ended up not going into work on Tuesday. The guys all went out to move the cars so the plowers could plow. Ed and Ray anded up finally going over to our female neighbors to talk to them, like they had been talking about it the night before. After we all went to soo the Lord of the Rings. I liked the movie. It was fun to hang out with all the guys thins week. I just wish there was another girl to go with me. Oh well I had sooooooo much fun this week!"

"event","Yeah, I haven't written here in a while. I've been soo busy with school and work. I got in a little fight with some of my friends from Hatfield last week, but that has pretty much died down which is good. I found out that my roommates really are the greatest friends I could ever even ask for!
Anyways, I have to work today, (that sucks) but at least Matt does too, so we can go in together. Oh yeah, two of our fishies died last week. We woke up one morning last week and saw our algae eater just stuck in a bush, when we freed it, it just floated to the top. That was sorta upstting, we think he died because he didn't have enough algae to eat yet. Then the other night Matt and I came home and saw that our green glass fish was stuck to the filter, when I freed him he was still alive, but he ended up dying in the middle of the night. It was really sad to watch him try to swim, because he kept tipping over. Oh well, we still have four left. Matt and I want to go up to a Greenfield to get some more sometime.
Well I have to get going to work. Yuck!!!"

I saw Sarah and Aubrey at WalMart. I didn't say anything to them, they did say anything to me either. I was sorta bummed there, but oh well my day got better. 
Matt and I got food on the way home so we could eat. When we got home, Ray was on the phone with Lisa. I talked to her for a few, I didn't really know what to talk about though. I'm such a geek! I was happy to talk to a girl though!
Oh yeah, Sarah was on-line tonight. Brian talked to her and was asking her what was wrong with her. We started talking and settled what was going on between me and them... I guess they are coming over tomorrow. Ray and I told Lisa she should come over too. I hope she does. It would be nice to have another girl for a friend..."

"event","I just called WalMart to tell them That I wasn't comming in today. They are such assholes! When Sue called me yesterday she ws really understanding about it and told me to take it easy and to feel better. Well I just called them to tell them I wasn't comming in today either and Jen gave me shit about calling out. She doesn't care if you are sick, she just wants you to be in work and be her btch. I hate Jen so much she is the worst manager at WalMart. All she does is sit at the managers computer and talk. She always gets personal phone calls and talks to her husband on the cafe phone, so when I need to get a hold of a CSM I have to wait until princess Jen gets off the phone. I really hate her. 
Last week I decided that I was going to stop calling out unless I really needed to. Well I really needed to this week. I wish I was still a minor. Whenever Jen wanted to give me shit, she had to talk to my mom first, she was afraid to do that. Now since I'm 18 and living on my own, that's all she does. Jen and Joanne, they are the biggest kiss asses in this whole company. I really wish they would go to another store, but I know that won't happen cause they kiss Chris's ass, and won't move. So I'm stuck.
I am really considering getting a better job over the summer. I thought that I could work at the post office with my mom, but my mom says that wouldn't be a good idea. i just don't think that I get paid enough to deal with bitchy customers, bitchy managers, and machines that do not work half the time(Cafe)."

"event","I hate it when I get sick! I stayed in bed all day yesterday. I felt bad, my manager at work called me and asked if I wanted to come in early and work some extra hours, I had to tell her I wasn't comming in at all. She's always trying to give me extra hours when I need them, so turning her down made me feel bad.
I'm not sure exactly what I have but I do know one thing is streppe throat. That really sucks. I couldn't eat anything. All I ate yesterday was two jello cups and some chicken noodle soup. Any time I tried to eat real food it was way too hard to swallow. At one point yesterday, I got up just to shower so I wouldn't feel completely gross, but I jsut went right back to bed. Later on in the day, I couldn't stand to sleep much more so I tried playng some video games but that got boring fast. 
By the time Matt got home with my get well package (he's suck a good boyfirnd!) I was completely bored out of my mind. Matt brought home some jello snack cups, so I caould actually eat something, a magazine for me to read while I was in bed, some Benadryl, and a stuffed Unicorn cause he knows that I lave stuffed animals when I'm sick.
When I woke up this morning, Matt had to get ready for work. I was thinking whether or not I should go into work today. I kept waking up last night with chills then all of a sudden I would be really cold. My throat feels a little better, (I ate half a bagel for breakfast) but it still hurts to swallow. I decided that even though it would be time and a half to work today that it would be better for me to stay home. I would be working in the cafe, and with me being sick that wouldn't be very good. 
I wish I could go back to sleep but I'm not very tired, I probably slept about 18 or 19 hours yesterday."

I told Ray this secret about my boyfriend and one of my best friends in the whole world. We were all just kidding around, but I fvcked up. Matt is talking to me but I don't know if I have my best friend anyomore. Just great Krystal, you talk about how you hate not having girls for friends, and then you go and fuck up your friendship with one of the greatest friends you've ever had. What a fvcking idiot! 
I felt really bad tonight after that happened, so I took a drive. I didn't tell anyone I was going. I sort of worried Matt, I don't know about my other roommates. I think they are starting to hate me. I was thinking of moving back in with my parents, or even with my grandma for a couple weeks so that I can get away. I don't think that the guys would like that though, mostly case they would be worried if I would pay my part of the bill though. Oh well.
I don't know why I keep doing this, I'm retarded when it comes to being a friend. I don't have any real ones I guess. I guess Matt is my only true friend. No matter how much I fvck up, he always is there for me, and understands and forgives me. I hope I never take that for granted. I love him so much. I feel so bad for worrying him. I should have at least let him know that I was taking a ride.
I'm just happy I didn't lose him tonight..."

"event","I was stood up by Katelyn today. That sucks. I was really looking forward to hanging out with her too. Matt and Brian had to work today and Ray had is class tonight. I had nothing to do.
I brought Matt in to work early so we could stop at his parents to get his grades for last semester I thought he did pretty good, but he didn't think so. I cheered him up a little bit though.
On our way to his parents house we saw two accidents, a Trailer Truck got stuck under the bridge in Westfield. I thought that was funny because there are signs all over telling taller trucks have to go around and the dumb ass didn't pay attention. Then there was a three car accident by the Purple Onion, that had happened just before Matt and I got there (no police were there yet).
When we got to Matt's parents' house, we played with our kitties Lucy and Ricky. I think that made Matt and I feel better about traffic and made us loosen up a little.
Matt and I almost got into an accident ourselves later on too This girl slammed on her brakes because she was going to miss the turn into the Big Y in Southampton, and Matt almost rear ended her. That would have sucked!
After I dropped Matt off at work, I went to visit wy parents for a little while. I had called Katelyn just before we got to WalMart and she told me that she would call me when she got home, so I figured that I would only be at my parents for only a couple of minutes. Well it got to be about 6:30 and Katelyn still hadn't called. I ended up going out to eat with my mom, which turned out to be really fun. I still wish that I could have hung out with Katelyn. Oh well. Girls hate me.
I scare all the girls I meet. Girls think I'm crazy and weird. I think I'm gonna start being more girly and not be loud or swear or anything. I just won't talk at all. I have to do something, because I can't sit at home by myself every Friday night..."

It was nice to have some time to myself. I listened to my new Avril Lavigne CD that I got for Christmas from Matt. I sang along too, which is something that I only do when I'm alone. It was fun. 
Work went by really fast tonight surprisingly. I was on a register for most of the night. I really didn't mind it that much because I don't even remember when the last time I was on a register. There really wasn't anyone working tonight. We were pretty short handed. Oh well, managers are dumb like that.
During my 15 minute break today I bought Signs. I saw this movie two times in the theaters. I made Matt and Ray watch it with me tonight in Rays room (a.k.a. the basement). I still jumped at all the jumpy parts. I think Ray jumped once too, but I think it was because I jumped first.
Nicole called Brian today. She didn't make it past her first round in her dancing competition. Brian said that she was pretty bummed out. I hope she doesn't let that bring her down the rest of the week. I told Brian that she can still get something out of this whole week as long as she talks to the agents there and not to let the fact that she only made it to the first round. She was still picked to go to go to IMTA which is a big acomplishment in its own. Brian is talking to her now, I think she feels a little better than she did before.
I talked to Katelyn last night. I was upset for a little while after I went shopping with Ray, Brian and Matt. Brian wanted to make me feel better and decided to call her up to cheer me up. It really worked. Katelyn and I don't have to work on Friday so we are going to get together. Hopefully she can stay over so I can have some more girl time. I'm starting to miss hanging out with girls! Maybe we can go to the Land of Aahs, the water massage place at the Holyoke Mall!
Oh yeah, my whole body is sore from work today. Since I have been on a register in so long, my body wasn't used to it. When I was on my way home from work my knees were killing me and so was my back. It sucked."

When Ray and I got home from work last night, we all played Mario Party. I lost, because I suck balls! Oh well it was fun though. When we finished playing that, we started playing monopoly. I lost interest really fast and gave up. The guys weren't really happy with that. Oh well.

"event","I decided to call out from work today. I really didn't feel like making the 1 hour drive into work. Matt and I woke up at like 1:00 this afternoon, I would have had to leave the apartment at like 2:30 to be to work on time because of the roads. Wal*Mart doesn't care though. (I don't care if they care though either)
Matt and I had to dig out his car when we got up too. The plowers were at the apartment to plow out all of the parking spaces and wanted ALL of the cars to move. Of course, like the last two storms that we have had, about 5 or 6 of the cars around our apartment didn't move (they are supposed to tow them) and the plowers just plowed their cars in. It sucks! When Matt and I came home tonight, we had to park really far away because the cars that were plowed in their spaces moved during the day and parked in the plowed spaces leaving the snow covered spots for the considerate people who actually got off their lazy asses and move their cars. It really made us mad. Ray says that he's going to the office on Monday to complain. I should go with him cause it really isn't fair to the people who move their cars to have to park so far away.
Anyways, Matt and I went to the Westfield Wal*mart to pick up some stuff for the apartment. We spent about $60 there. I got Matt and me a comforter for our bed. We got a ducky shower curtain, trash can, and 4 new towels for the upstairs bathroom. I wanted to get more towels cause we were doing laundry like everyday just so we would have clean towels!
After Matt and I went to Wal*mart we went to his parents house to get our hair cut. I got my hair cut really short, I have never gotten it this short before. I really like it so does Matt. Ray said he has to get used to it. I don't know what Brian thinks of it because he went to sleep before I could ask him.
Oh yeah, Nicole got her license yesterday! She didn't get to go cruising with us because of the snow storm though. She leaves for Boston tomorrow sometime, and leaves for L.A. on Monday, I hope she has a lot of fun. I know that Brian will probably sit around the apartment all week moping around, but it is only a week so I don't think it will be that bad. He had to work and stuff. I think when I am not working I'll see if he wants to do something. 
Well I better get some sleep, Matt has to work at 9:00. Wal*mart Sucks!"

"event","A new year. WOW, I can't believe that last year is over already! As one of my new year's resolutions I have decided to start a journal. I figure that since so much in my life has changed in my life in the past couple of months, I want to keep track of it all and let my real friends know what is going on in my life since I can't see them all the time. 
I just moved into an appartment with three of the greatest guys I know, Matt, (my boyfriend) Brian, and Ray. They are all like big brothers to me. It's been really great the last couple of weeks hanging out with them, especially now that I don't se my friends from high school anymore.
Sarah and Aubrey have all of a sudden stopped talking to me. I keep telling the people around me that it doesn't really bother me. It really does bother me though. It's really hard for me to make female friends. I just get along better with guys, and I think people are relizing this now because I've opted t move in with three guys! I have seen Mike, Aubrey and Sarah at WalMart a couple of times, but they ignore me, so whatever, oh well. 
I invited both Sarah and Aubrey to the appartment many times, but they always have something else to do. So whatever. I still hang out with Katelyn. Which is good for me, not sure about Brian though. But it doesn't matter, he's with Nicole now. I like Nicole, she's really nice! (a lot nicer than Bethann who I hate!) She's going to IMTA next week. I think that really cool that w have that in common. I'm really happy for Brian. He's really happy with Nicole. They look so good together. I'm partly glad that him and Katelyn didn't hook up. Brian has Nicole and Katelyn has Eric. Brian will miss Nicole so much next week, but it's going to be such a great experience for her.
Katelyn got her license today. She was so happy. (Nicole is going for hers tomarrow.) I wish Katelyn would find a good guy. She deserves one so bad. I also wish that Ray would find a good girl because he really really deserves one. The thought has crossed my mind to set Katelyn and Ray up, but after what happened between her and Brian, I don't want to put her or Ray though that. Ray is such a great guy, I realy wish I could help him out. I realy care about him, my roommates are like an extended family to me. I love them all.
Things with Matt and me are good, no make that great! We've become even more close since we've moved in. We share everything, from money to our chores, we even help each other out at work! I love him so much, he means so much to me. I don't know what I would do without him! He's been so great to me.
well I guess I'm off to play board games with the guys!"

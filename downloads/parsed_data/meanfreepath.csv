Between his schedule and mine, we have managed to have a grand total of three lessons together.  I practice pretty regularly, generally late at night after calling it a day in the lab, and have made some progress, I think.  The pedalboard is no longer utterly foreign, I've gotten familiar with legato organ fingering techniques, and have started to get a feel for the non-legato touch called for in Baroque music.  I am also starting to get my hands and feet coordinated enough to play pieces with non-trivial pedal parts.

I've gotten roped into playing in the Harvard Organ Society's midnight Halloween recital tomorrow.  There is currently a dearth of undergraduate organists, and I'm one of two Harvard students playing.  Carson Cooman, one of the Mem Church staff musicians, and Chris will also play.  Chris will be playing the ""Allegro"" from Widor VI, one of the pieces with which he just won the Canadian International Organ Competition in Montreal, as well as Boellmann's Suite Gothique, with its exceptionally spooky closing toccata.

"event","I've started to think a little about what I'd like to do in the 5 full days I have (technically, Friday night to Thursday morning) I have to travel in Italy after the light scattering meeting.  I'm certainly dividing my time between Florence and Rome -- indeed, while searching around, I found a steal of an air fare from Catania to Florence (significantly less expensive than the base train fare, not including a sleeper surcharge) and so I'll fly directly to Florence on Friday night (yes, I checked for flights to Pisa as well, which has the larger airport).

Right now I'm trying to decide how to apportion my time between Florence and Rome.  In some sense it would be natural to spend two days in Rome and three in Florence.  There's a ton I'd love to see in Florence, though -- the Uffizi by itself could easily be an all-day affair, and I don't know that I'd like to cram the rest of Florence's historical and architectural sites into one other day.  Clearly there's a lot to see in Rome (easily a day in the Vatican City, not to mention the sites of Ancient Rome).  But I'm kind of sensing that there's so much in Rome that spending either two or three days is going to feel a bit overwhelming regardless, whereas three full days in Florence might let take in a fair bit without having to run around like crazy.

Thoughts?  The decision is complicated by a lot of places (like the Uffizi) being closed on Mondays."

It now appears, however, that I may have a reason to be back in Boston on January 1.  Although declining the potential engagement here is on the table, part of me would like to accept it.

"event","While trying to do some long-overdue maintenance on my bike after dance tonight, and in particular while inspecting and adjusting my front brakes, I discovered that my front wheel might be slightly out of true, possibly as a result of the pothole crash.  It'll have to go in to the shop eventually, as I have neither the knowledge nor the wherewithal to retrue my own wheels.

I am thinking I'll bring my bike in to the Broadway Bicycle School and use a combination of stand/tool rental and staff assistance when the time comes later this summer for a thorough tune-up.  I should check with a chain measuring tool, but I would not be surprised if the chain and cassette need replacing after a year of all-weather usage.  I'm not sure if bearing overhauls -- front and rear hubs, headset, and bottom bracket -- are necessary right now.

Also, I am seriously considering replacing my nylon pedals with more durable metal platforms, to which I would mount <a href='http://powergrips.mrpbike.com/' target=_blank>Power Grips</a>.  They're an inexpensive way to get power from the upstroke and are considerably more appealing to me than straps and toe clips, which would be nearly impossible to use optimally when riding in traffic with frequent stops.  I don't want to switch to clipless pedals, used with cycling shoes that have a cleat on the bottom, as I don't want to always have to carry whatever shoes I'm going to need for the day.  Shimano makes a pedal that is clipless on one side and platform on the other, but it is not cheap, and I don't envision myself using the clipless side for commuting or utility riding, the bulk of what I do.  So springing for clipless capability when I'd only use it occasionally for recreational rides doesn't seem wise to me.  Anyone have experience with or opinions on Power Grips, or feel strongly that I should try clipless?"

I should have spent some of the evening in lab, as I got in very late this morning after my late arrival at home last night, or else done some practicing at home, but I decided to go to Scottish class to see what Alex Gray would be like.  I didn't really talk to him, but did dance in a set he was in during the social hour.  He is a lot more jovial and friendly than what I would have expected the chairman of the RSCDS to be like.  I'm glad I went, as now I'll be more at ease about Thursday, and with the amount of playing I've been doing of late it has been ages since I actually danced a full class and social hour.

On the way home, alas, I heard a clatter behind me shortly after coming through the pothole-riddled section of Main St near the Rt 16 overpass.  The bracket for my bike tail-light had failed, and while the LED's are intact the unit was effectively destroyed by the fall from my bike, and by the traffic that passed before I had a chance to recover the pieces from the middle of the road.  I started to walk my bike towards home as biking with fast-moving traffic without a functioning tail-light scares me a bit.  Fortunately, a fellow Scottish dancer who also routinely bikes to class came by shortly after, and he kindly gave me an escort home.

This is the third tail-light I've lost in less than a year.  My first one was a Cat-Eye removable clip-on; its bracket was sufficiently weakened by the <a href='http://meanfreepath.livejournal.com/238347.html' target=_blank>crash I had in November</a> that a few days afterwards the light fell off while I was biking, without me noticing.  I replaced that light with a cheaper clip-on, but due most likely to jarring from potholes that light also fell out of its bracket several days after I installed it.  I finally replaced that one with another Cat-Eye, but one that bolted on to my rear rack via an L-bracket.  The bracket failed right where it was bolted on, which is also right where it bends, which in hindsight is not too surprising.

I'm not sure what I want to replace this light with.  I kind of liked the bolt-on bracket; maybe it's OK if I plan on replacing the bracket every six months or so.  Nothing else I have encountered stands up as well to the constant jarring of riding the pothole-riddled streets of Somerville and Medford.  Any cyclists out there have any opinions?"

"event","This morning, I was biking to work down Oxford St as I usually do.  Oxford has been a mess of potholes for a while, and I really don't enjoy riding it; I do primarily because it is more direct, has less traffic, and fewer lights than Mass Ave.  This winter the pothole situation went from annoying to downright dangerous, and of late the situation has been exacerbated by the water main construction that has caused large portions of the street to be dug up and additional potholes to be formed by the passage of heavy construction vehicles.

So I was going down Oxford, and tried to dodge a pothole -- and the next thing I knew I was down on the ground with my bike on top of me.  I got extensive scrapes on my hands and elbows, ruined the shirt I was wearing, and gave the handlebars some dings, but otherwise avoided serious damage to myself or my bike.  Fortunately no one was driving behind me at the time.  One of my labmates kindly helped me clean up when I got into work.

I've talked to a few people and apparently the consensus is that it's better to just go through a pothole (or, if one has sufficiently good bike handling skills and pedal clips, to jump the pothole) than to swerve around it.  Lesson learned, I guess.  I do hope they finish the Oxford St construction soon; I've had close calls on it before (the most serious one being a dumb failure to take the entire lane, and a subsequent pothole swerve bringing me overly close for comfort to a car that was trying to pass me) and the condition of the pavement is so bad that it really is only a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured or killed.

It was a somewhat embarrassing accident -- Ed called me over at teatime right before rehearsal this afternoon.  Apparently he too had been driving down Oxford St right before my crash, and had seen me down in the middle of the road through his rear-view mirror.  He had wanted to stop, but because of the construction and the police trying to wave traffic through there was nowhere to pull over."

The choir is singing a funeral at MemChurch tomorrow, for someone who was apparently a big fan of the choir.  I'm not especially thrilled since tomorrow is busy enough, but fortunately choral funerals/memorial services happen at most once or twice a year.  It must be a request from the family, as we don't usually sing stuff like this, but the anthem for tomorrow is an exceptionally cheesy arrangement of ""O Shenandoah.""  If I should get hit by a bus or something, I should very much like to have the choir at my funeral -- but please not singing that piece.  The Purcell ""Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts,"" or perhaps the somewhat sentimental but potentially beautiful Virgil Thomson ""My Shepherd Will Supply My Need,"" but dear G-d, nothing as schlocky as ""O Shenandoah.""

It could be worse, I suppose.  The other day Chris was telling us about a funeral he had to play for a professor of economics specializing in railroads -- whose family requested his college fight song and ``I've Been Workin' on the Railroad"" for his memorial service."

The service was unforgettable, but not in a good way.  MemChurch's Easter Vigil starts with a fire lit in a barbecue grill; this year, winds blew smoke from the fire, reeking of lighter fluid fumes, right into the church.  And then -- the fire alarm went off.  The decision was made to proceed with the service nonetheless.  The feeling of processing slowly down the center aisle of the church with Ed chanting the Exsultet, while the strobe lights of the alarm flashed and firefighters in full turnout gear trooped across the front of the sanctuary with their portable radios chattering, was indescribably bizarre."

Starting with APS, and continuing through this week, I've gotten onto a bad cycle where I have a hard time shutting my brain down when it comes time to sleep.  I suspect excessive coffee consumption is at least partially to blame, especially when waking up tired makes one want coffee.  Tomorrow morning we have the dress rehearsal for the St John Passion, so I get to sleep in a little bit, but not much.  But hopefully that will help.

Last night I went to the final talk in MemChurch's Lenten speaker series, where Prof. Mark Jordan of the Divinity School spoke on Christian sexual ethics, particularly regarding same-sex marriage, and directly questioned whether and how churches should be blessing any type of union.  The series was co-sponsored by MemChurch and the Harvard Episcopal Chaplaincy, and afterwards I took the opportunity to introduce myself to the Episcopal chaplain.  I might try to go to Good Friday services at Christ Church Cambridge, at which that chaplaincy is based.  The Choral Fellows are busy for Maundy Thursday, and the Easter Vigil, and are of course with the full choir on Easter Sunday, but don't have to sing (or sit through) three hours of Prof. Gomes's preaching on Christ's Seven Last Words on Friday afternoon.

Anybody planning on going to Pinewoods this summer?  I'm not sure what I'd like to do.  Scottish Pinewoods is always a blast, if intense -- I don't know how the people who do both the weekend and the week have anything left by the end of it, particularly those who tend to be up late for the post-dance jam sessions.  I've heard the English-Scottish session is a bit more laid back, and what's more Liz Donaldson is music directing this year.  So I'd think about either doing Scottish Week, Scottish Weekend, or if I were nuts English-Scottish Week plus the Scottish Weekend.

If I were to only go to Scottish Weekend, it might be feasible to do some kind of traveling this summer.  I've never really traveled without my family, other than the UChoir tour to Mexico three years ago (which was wonderful, partly because I got to know <lj user=pastwatcher> a lot better).

Dr. Austin often turns to choristers to fill slots in the Morning Prayers speaker schedule, and in particular Choral Fellows since we're at Prayers anyway.  This happens to be a particularly student-heavy week, with two other Fellows speaking.

Thursday happens to be the Feast of the Annunciation on both the Catholic and Episcopal liturgical calendars.  Both the Lectionary and the Book of Common Prayer put down basically the same texts, including Luke's account of the Annunciation, and Psalm 40, ""Expectans expectavi.""  Speakers are free to discourse on anything they feel like, but as an ex-Catholic/wannabe Episcopalian I don't think the liturgical calendar should be completely ignored.  Somewhat unfortunately, the anthem that's been put down is some 20th century work (which is fine in and of itself -- I believe in supporting new music) taking its text from the Tao Te Ching.  For the Annunciation, I do wish we were doing a Magnificat setting instead, although I can't think of any for TB or TTBB off the top of my head.

To celebrate we made a cake for group meeting on Thursday, drawing on the <i>Science</i> paper on hard-sphere clusters we recently published -- someone hit on the idea of making clusters out of mochi ice cream balls, and placing them in a cake microwell.

So on Wednesday evening one of my labmates came over with another sheet cake pan.  We mixed up a double batch of a yellow cake recipe and let that bake; we also prepared a large quantity of buttercream frosting.  After the cakes had cooled, we stacked them.  I prepared a template by cutting a 9"" x 13"" piece of parchment paper, drawing a circle in the center, and then cutting it out.  Using this as a guide, I cut out part of the top layer of the cake to make the microwell.  The following day Dave made the clusters out of mochi and toothpicks, and the first-years bought M&M's to represent the depletant particles causing a short-range attraction and a chocolate scale bar.

This evening I completed the bicycle repair class I signed up for at the Broadway Bicycle School.  The subject of tonight's class was rear derailleur adjustments.  I'm slightly miffed that I ever found the derailleur intimidating -- it's really not a complicated mechanical device at all.  Over the past few classes we've covered a bunch of stuff worth knowing, like chain replacement, brake adjustments, and bearing system adjustments.  Before the bearing class I had never seen or used a cone wrench, and the brake class happened to come up in the nick of time as both sets of my brake pads were almost completely worn out.  The first class was on tires and flat replacement, which I'd done on my own before; nonetheless, I picked up some useful tips.  All in all, I think it's been a worthwhile investment and I can recommend the class with enthusiasm.  Maybe down the line I'll sign up for the advanced class, covering wheel truing, cable replacement, front derailleurs, and hub and headset overhauls."

Time was when I considered myself a Republican, and while there are plenty of typical Democratic positions on economic issues with which I disagree, I do not want to send a supporter of the use of torture to the Senate.  More importantly, in the current political climate, one fears for the ability of Congress to pass any legislation without a supermajority.  And while there is much that is problematic in the current health care reform proposals, it would be a disaster to see that fail.

I was originally planning to spend part of the weekend at Arisia, and also need to spend a bunch of time practicing.  I just made a donation to the Coakley campaign, and now I wonder if the weekend would not be better spent volunteering for her campaign."

"event","This evening Catherine Miller and I played downstairs for Basic, which went decently, although in hindsight the name tune for ""Birks of Invermay"", while pretty, is not a good one for beginners to dance to.  John Chambers led the band upstairs for the social hour, for which Catherine and I also played.  I was pretty happy with how that went, for the most part.  Our second strathspey set had Alasdair Fraser's lovely ""Pamela Rose Grant,"" as well as one of my favorite strathspeys, Nathaniel Gow's ""Sir George Clerk of Pennycuik,"" which I fell in love with from one of Muriel Johnstone's recordings.  We followed that with De'il Amang the Tailors, which is fun to play as well as dance, and closed with Jay Ungar's ""Ashokan Farewell.""  The Ungar by itself would have made my evening, but because of the rest of it I'm still on a musical high...

I recently made a few purchases of a musical nature.  <lj user=qianian> kindly gave me his copy of the Portland Collection, Vol. 1 a few months ago; I just bought the second volume.  Now I've got the standard tunebooks (or at least what is standard up here in Boston) for contra as well as Scottish and English.  I also got the first 2 volumes of ""The Waltz Book,"" which I've also been asked to play from before.  A personal pet peeve: Volume 1 of that work contains ""Neil Gow's Lament on the Death of His Second Wife.""  While it may indeed be in waltz time, playing it at the tempo and with the lilt necessary for waltzing would utterly destroy the feeling of arguably the most pathetic Scottish slow air ever written.

I also bought an inexpensive Hohner <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodica' target=_blank>melodica</a>.  No one around here plays Scottish melodica, but I have heard it used in English dance music.  I figured it'd be a cheap, extremely portable instrument, capable of playing chords as well as melody, that wouldn't be too hard to pick up as a pianist.  Hopefully by the time NEFFA or Pinewoods rolls around I'll be sufficiently proficient to be able to play it in jam sessions.

Catherine and I are going to apply to play a 20 minute recital slot at the Harvard Arts First festival on May 1st.  We've started to toss around some ideas for sets.  Assuming it works out it'll be the first time I'll have performed in a formal recital as a pianist in years.  But it'll be a good incentive to get some more solo tunes under my belt in the next few months.  Moreover, as an RSCDS musician you so often have to abuse the music to suit the dancing -- pipe marches get sped up to jig tempo, and slow airs played as strathspeys usually have to go considerably quicker than one would want to.  Nor does one generally get the opportunity to play strathspey/reel medleys.  So it'll be nice to not have to stay within the constraints of RSCDS style."

"event","In keeping with the decision I arrived at last night, I attended the 11:15 service at Trinity Episcopal in Copley Square this morning.  I'd been in front of the church plenty of times, when <lj user=gallian> had talked me into going to outdoor international dancing a few summers back, but had never gone in.  It was a mostly pleasant 5 mile bike ride downtown from my apartment, save for one maniac of a driver speeding and swerving on the Harvard Bridge.  And I hadn't realized before how pretty the stretch of Comm Ave that runs through the Back Bay is with snow on the ground.

As for the service -- a lot of Episcopal churches do Communion every Sunday.  Trinity has a weekly communion at 9:00, but their principal 11:15 service is Morning Prayer on all but the 1st Sunday of the month.  One of the things I'd like to find out is the rationale for doing Morning Prayer vs. Holy Eucharist as a Sunday service.

The full Episcopalian Morning Prayer is considerably more involved, and richer, than the brief service customary at Harvard.  (I would not be surprised if Harvard's Morning Prayers were much more extensive than the current 15 minutes in days of yore when attendance was compulsory.)  Early in the service I was surprised that the entire congregation was asked to sing the plainchant canticle with the choir -- it's so easy to trip over the words or move incorrectly when not on the reciting tone.  The canticle was followed by a spoken psalm and two Scripture lessons, with an anthem after each lesson.  These were the <i>Magnificat</i> and <i>Nunc Dimmitis</i> in Bb of Stanford (pretty -- in UChoir we almost never get to sing Magnificats).  During the Nunc I was surprised to see a woman in the front of the sanctuary waving a kite mounted to a pole; this was apparently the signal for the children in the congregation to assemble downstairs for the childrens' sermon.

The preacher's text this morning was the baptism of Christ, according to Luke.  The preacher spoke about the <i>imago Dei</i>, our recognition of that through Baptism, and of the need to be listening to God's call in our lives -- a focused and relatively concise sermon.  Following the sermon there was another anthem during the offertory, the ""Three Kings"" of Cornelius, the one with the bass solo over a serene ""Wie schon leuchtet der Morgenstern.""  The service concluded with the usual blessing and hymn, and a choral benediction.

I stopped by the Welcome Table in the church foyer after the postlude (Buxtehude, Praludium in F).  The lady there happened to be a convert from Catholicism, as well.  She invited me downstairs for the coffee hour, where I chatted with a couple of people.  It seemed relatively friendly for a large church, and certainly way more so than most Catholic churches.  I could definitely see myself coming back."

"event","During this January Term, Sunday services continue at Memorial Church, but the choir is off and there are no Morning Prayers -- I would venture to guess that only UChoir's grad students and maybe a handful of the undergrads are in town.  So tomorrow and next Sunday are rare opportunities to check out other churches in the area.  Given how many churches there are in Boston, choosing one or two is no easy task.

I'm pretty sure I'm going to limit myself to Episcopalian, for now.  There are some other traditions I would be very interested in checking out at some point, in particular the Society of Friends -- I was playing the piano for Mass nearly every Sunday at Swarthmore, and never went to Quaker meeting.  I find much to respect in the Quakers, but I could never be a pacifist.

It's enough of a hike that I don't think I'd be going there regularly, but I'd like to check out Trinity Episcopal down in Copley Square tomorrow morning for their 11:15 service with choir.  Liturgy looks like it'll be sufficiently high church for my taste, they've got one of the best organs in Boston, and it is encouraging that their website mentions an LGBT fellowship."

The cost seems pretty reasonable for a 10-hour course, and I look forward to being able to extend my bike repair abilities beyond replacing punctured inner tubes.

My brother and I were talking yesterday about various people we had known from high school, and somehow the subject of a local New Year's tradition that I participated in for a few years came up.  This was a 5 mile road race known as the Hamilton Hangover.  I'd generally go run it with some teammates from cross country/track; if nothing else we'd get some fast mileage for the day and a T-shirt out of it.

It then occurred to me that due to the race's late start, around noon, it would be possible if insane to have an unforgettable New Year's by dancing DelVal Hogmanay, stretching legs and icing feet, getting a few hours of sleep, and then running the Hamilton Hangover.  One would probably even have time to make it to the DelVal recovery party after the race, assuming one had any energy left and one's legs were not turned into mush.

Frankly, two or three miles of very gentle running to warm up the legs, followed by extensive stretching, might actually be quite helpful in recovering from Hogmanay."

"event","I was more than a little shocked this morning to notice the amount of corrosion that had built up on my chain and rear cassette.  I hadn't noticed it Saturday when I was wrestling on my winter tires; I'm sure the exposure to snow and road salt over the last few days has not helped.  I do know I'm well overdue for a chain cleaning and lubrication and evidently need to attend to that once as soon as possible after I get back from NJ; obviously I need to greatly improve my (heretofore minimal) bike maintenance routine.

I hope the corrosion on my cassette is just rust from the chain accumulating, rather than any serious damage to the cassette itself.  I should hate to have to replace that component in under a year's worth of riding.  According to the interwebs, removal of the rear cassette is a nontrivial task requiring some specialized tools, which I do not own.  I guess I'll have to see what I can do about cleaning it while mounted.

Now, more than ever, I really feel like I should take a bicycle mechanics' course, such as that offered by the Broadway Bicycle School.  A good experimental physicist ought to be ashamed of having as little mechanical knowledge, practical skill, and courage to work on his own bike as I do."

I had invited a mixture of SWILfolk, grad school friends, and people from Scottish dancing, which worked out pretty nicely.  We had a nice mixture of conversation, some Dominion, and some card gaming.

For me the most memorable part of the evening was realizing that we had enough experienced Scottish dancers to form a 4 couple set if a few grad school colleagues stepped up.  I don't have a stereo, and our DVD player had gone on the fritz, so instead I got some help lugging my piano downstairs.  We moved the dining room table aside, winched up the chandelier with a carabiner, and got the people we needed to form a set.  <lj user=tirerim> then explained progression in SCD and led a walkthrough of ""De'il Among the Tailors.""  Meanwhile I had managed to put together a suitable tune set (De'il, Ale is Dear, Loch Earn, High Road to Linton), and we proceeded to do the dance 8 times through.  It seemed like everyone dancing had a nice time, and it was fun for me to play and watch the dancing.

It was a night of firsts -- first large social gathering I've had in the new apartment, first real party I've ever hosted since college, and also first time playing a full 8x32 set solo for Scottish dancing.  All in all, a great evening thanks to great people."

-- Grad school offer letters, scribbled notes from meetings with profs during visits.  I'm sort of boggled at how little I knew about real physics then, not that I claim to know a whole lot now.

-- Scores from Music 11/12; I really enjoyed those music classes even though they required a lot of work.

-- Readings from humanities classes from freshman and sophomore years; for the most part tossed.

-- Score of Brad Gersh's Music 12 final composition, a duet for piano and flute.  I got to perform it in the class recital with his sister Jessica, with whom I had frequently worked on physics p-sets, and a serious flautist.  Playing that piece with Jessica was a real pleasure and a highlight of my last few weeks at Swat.

Things to do this week, not work-related:
-- Take ill-fitting clothes which for some reason I brought up with me from NJ and haven't touched in 3 years to Goodwill.  Open 10-7.
-- Queue up at the Somerville Traffic & Parking Department to apply for a moving van parking permit.  Open 9-4, and until 7 on Thursday.  I imagine that going right at 9 one of these days will result in the least waiting."

Fortunately I have a Toyota Tacoma pickup truck reserved through Zipcar from 12:00 to 5:00 on the 1st; hopefully that will be enough time to get moved."

"event","One decision I do have to make in the near future is the color in which my bedroom in the new place is to be painted.  The current occupant wanted the room in a dark blue, which the landlords agreed to on condition that he repaint the room to the desires of the next occupant before leaving.

I've never had a room be anything other than white, and indeed have never really done anything remotely creative with my living space.  <lj user=areyououtthere> used to complain about the white, barren walls in my apartment, and in hindsight I think I'd have to agree with her.

I went over to the hardware store today to look at paint swatches; the trouble is that paint comes in about 10 million shades.  I have not the foggiest notion of the rudiments of interior design so I'm sort of at a loss for where to begin.  The floors are hardwood and most of the furniture I have is wood-toned, although nothing really matches.  At the moment I'm leaning towards either cream or a gentle yellow, although I was mulling over light greens, blues, and blue-grays.

Thoughts?"

"event","Note to self: pastry work in a non-air conditioned kitchen on a warm, muggy summer night is not the best idea.

(I had decided I was going to reclaim the kitchen from the chaos it's seen and is about to see -- the sink goes out of service tomorrow -- by making a peach cobbler with a kick for the BIDA contra dance tomorrow night.  The kick comes from a generous amount of fresh ginger and a few splashes of habanero chili hot sauce.)"

"event","<P>I'm kinda disapointed that summer is over. But then again I think I'm coming out of this summer as a different person. I'm not sure what has changed or why but its for the better. Also I didnt get hurt excessively. Thats always a double plus. Even though I didnt have a summer fling I'm still interested in someone so it could still happen. Unlike 95% of my classmates I'm looking forward to going back to school. I miss all of the social events and just hanging out with my friends 24/7. This summer held alot of challenges but thats ok cuz they didnt stop me from having a good time or being who i needed to be. Thanks to all who made my summer so enjoyable and thanks to all who are going to make this year a blast and a year to remember.</P>"

"event","<P>My computer finally works!!! I deleted a bunch of crap off of here so now its faster and I'm having less problems. In the near future I will be creating a different acount that will have all updates on my story that I'm going to be writing. So when I figure more out I'll let you know how to check it and&nbsp; give me ur opinion. Well thats all the lil stuff.... but I need your real opinion on a problem I have. The otherday after church i knew that i was there for a reason but i didnt know what it was. then later that night i came home and was talking to a very close friend of mine. thats when it hit me that i was at the service to hear the anouncment so&nbsp;i could hook my friend up. well i got all excited and started thinking how perfect it was. the only problem is im not sure if its going to because that person has to make it work not me and i dunno if they are going to do that cuz i know they can but they dont have the self esteem to do it. so am i supposed to keep pushing them, or some to a realization that my great inspiration was a dud...</P>"

"event","Theres times when I want something more
Someone more  like me
Theres times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete

Bute you see the colors in me
Like no one else
And behind dark glasses
You're something else

You're really lovely underneath it all
You want to love me underneath it all
I'm really lucky underneath it all
You're really lovely

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But lately you've been trying real hard
And gving me your best

And you give me the most gorgeous sleep
I've ever had
And when its real bad
I guess its not that bad

You're really lovely underneath it all
You want to love me underneath it all
I'm really lucky underneath it all
You're really lovely

So many moons we have seen
Stumbling back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better

You've used all your coupons
Now all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess its meant to be

You're really lovely underneath it all
You want to love me underneath it all
I'm really lucky underneath it all
You're really lovely"

"event","sometimes i feel
like i am drunk behind the wheel
the wheel of possibility
however it may roll
give it a spin
see if you can some how factor in
you know theres always more than one way
to say exactly what u mean to say
was out i out of my head? was i outa my mind?
how could i have ever been so blind?
i was waiting for an indication
it was hard to find
dont matter what i say only what i do
i never meant to do bad things to you
so quiet but i finally woke up
so if your sad then its time you spoke up too"

"event","Ok so today I thought that I'd get up early and get some stuff done. BIG MISTAKE. Yea I got up early and did stuff but then as I got done with everything I realized I had nothing to do. For those who dont know me this is a weird thing because I always have something to do even if its stupid or boring theres always a task for me. I'm not a big TV person and I'm shocked because I actually got to watch Dawson's Creek this morning ( Great show) . On a given day I would like just now be getting up.... so yea I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do now. So if you have like plans or anything please drop a hint cuz I'm gunna go nuts. Haha ok I'm going nuts already but same thing."

"event","Yea I know you're all prolly really surprise saysing to urself ""she actually made a post!!"" But get over it cuz it was my computers fault. Hehe. Earlier tonight I happened to be looking through some peoples LJs and in almost all of them I saw my name. Why someone would want me in their post I'm not sure because I'm not very fascinating. So if anyone can please tell me why all these people are talking about me drop me a hint. Thanks to everyone who made my birthday so fun and freakin awesome. Had a great time and I'd do it all over again. I'll make another post tomaro about something half way important but this is all for tonight."

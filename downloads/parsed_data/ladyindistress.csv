The suite that we thought we had lost we've actually got. Good things. 

I've got an incredible craving for chocolate, but I feel like if I eat anything I might vomit. An interesting combination."

But I also found out last week that the suite I was going to live with with my amazing future roommate and amazing future suite mates was given away, even though we had squatter's rights and had asked well before the deadline to have it. So now we're all sort of in a limbo in terms of where we're going to live, which is no bueno. 

I will see Jon in 5 days. This is very good. Jon, in general, is very good. 

I watched Silence of the Lambs last night. It was pretty good. I woke up at like, 5, after having dreams that Dr. Lector was coming to Dancing Bear to eat all of the employees. Mmm, toy store girls.

Jon is here and is sick. Kaitlin was sick all last week, and I believe I have caught something. Also, my left lower eye lid is read and puffy and hurting. I don't know what's up with all that, but I plan on having it looked at tomorrow. 
I am horribly procrastinating writing the schedule for my program. I need a detailed map of the Maryland section of the AT, but I don't have one. Oh well. 
I'm moving back on campus next year. I don't really know how to tell Kaitlin that this is happening. I think she'll be upset. But I think that it will work out better for me, and that we are better friends when we don't live together. 
Jon is considering moving to Asheville. But he's also considering finishing his paralegal degree in Seattle, or taking a federal job in Baltimore. I mostly just want him to be happy, but I'd really like it if he moved here. 
My birthday is sort of soon. Woo? It's not going to be much different to be 21. Not drinking will happen then too.

I'm also waiting for a call from my new friend Hank, because when this call happens it means that we're going to the Asiana Buffet with some of his roommates from school. I have never hung out with Hank before, and I don't know who is roommates are, but I sure hope they think I'm cool enough to be friends with Hank. 

I hope that Hank doesn't think that I asked to hang out with him because I'd like to pursue some sort of romantic relationship. I hope that's not too presumptuous to say. I just think he's neat and I want to get to know him, to be his friend. I can't remember the last time I asked a guy that I don't really know that well to hang out with me without the pretext of a possible romance. Have I ever asked a guy I don't really know that well to hang out with me without the pretext of a possible romance? I don't know. 

I think Brian and Kaitlin and I are going to have an ice cream social on Wednesday to celebrate the semester's end. Jon will be here and there are not many things that I love more than Jon and ice cream. 

I'm so thrilled that loving Jon is going to swimmingly.

Going home on Thursday. Taking the Blue Ridge Parkway, which should prove to be windy, long, and pretty. 

Umm. Does anyone want to come up with 20 hours of watershed-oriented service for 4th graders for me? Kay thanks."

I still can't believe that we're actually doing this. I remember when he told me that he was thinking of going to South America for the winter to learn Spanish/have an adventure, and the smile he had on his face when he asked me to go with him. And we're really doing it. 
He told me that he might move to Asheville in 6-8 months. I told him that I really, really like the idea. It would be pretty amazing to live in the same city. We could laugh and cuddle and take hikes and make dinner together all the time. It sounds pretty nice to me.

We got to move in a day early. My bed is wicked comfortable and I've unpacked alla my clothes (of which, I and Brian and Kaitlin have established, there are far too many articles). We bought a couch and a small shelf and are in the middle of decorating everything. That's gonna take a super long time. I have so much stuff I like on the walls. Most of them pictures, and most from Star/Star related events. Woo. 

School starts on Monday, which means that I leave for the woods very, very soon. This is very, very scary/super exciting. 

Kaitlin just asked me if I'm familiar with a band called Sisters with Hammers. 

Can I talk about Jon now? 'Cause I'm gonna. Can I say how fucking amazing he is? And how no one-not a single person, ever- has made me feel the way that he does? Tyler was great (at first, anyway), but Jon surpasses everything that I had with him. And the fact that he lives in Seattle doesn't bother me at all. I mean, yeah, it sucks a little, but the emotions that are swimming around in me are just fucking incredible. Aaahhh happymushygiggleyglitterrainbowsandponies. Good things. 

Okay. Gotta get things done. I want to paint today and put some things up. Woo!

That was the last saved thing that I had written. I just barely remember when that was. 

It's been a super long time. Like, 20 weeks or something. Shoooot me. 

Life is so good right now. I had a great summer working at camp and at Kenzie's, I met and worked with some really incredible people, Star was amazing even though the island was closed and we had to have the conference somewhere else, I'm falling in love with an absolutely remarkable person, and in a week I'm going on a 48 day backpacking/WFR/rock climbing/white water extravanganza. I go back to Asheville tomorrow and move in with Brian and Kaitlin on Thursday. 

This has been a summer of finding new friendships, strengthening old ones, finding out a ton more about myself, and just generally having a good time. It's so nice to say, ""I'm awesome!"" when people ask how I am. I'm really proud of myself for taking the risk of applying to Wilson without really knowing anything about it. It was scary and exciting and <i>exactly</i> what I needed. I finally feel at home. I love home."

Spent a week in merry land, and then a weekend in RI for the staff meeting. It was all mostly really great. Getting home sucked, though I'm pretty much over it and won't complain. 

Made up with a friend today. That was great, too. 

Didn't do a lot of homework that I needed to. Not so great, but did things that I needed to do for me, so it all sort of works out. 

I'm wearing a fancy felt hat.

There's a ton to say, but what it all boils down to, really, is this list:

-overwhelming amounts of school work
-amazing people
-heartache
-pretty days
-playing camp games during class
-connections
 and last, but not least, the continuous search for truth and meaning in my life."

Brian and Kaitlin and I are going to a Michael Franti and Spearhead show in Baltimore while Todd hangs out with some of his friends, and then all four of us are trucking it back to Myersville. I kind of can't wait. It'll be nice to be home and have time to relax. I'd like to take a couple of days to drive down to Salisbury to visit Laurel, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to. 

Dunno if I should call Jeff or not. We haven't spoken in over a month, and I'm not sure why. It's hard for me to call people here; it's been really easy to get wrapped up in things. The only people I call on a regular basis are my parents and Tyler. And that's only once or twice a week. Meh. We'll see. 

Birthday went well. I am now officially in the throes of emerging adulthood. Whatever that means. 

Trying to decide what I'm going to do with my summer. Maybe Norway, maybe a day camp with Brian and Kaitlin, maybe Kenzie's again. 

There are only 46 or so days of school left. Nutso.

I re-read the artcles  about Mr. Schofield in the RT Magazine (Middletown High's newspaper) from November 2004. Every now and then I remember how amazing he was, and get a little sad, but also get really happy. I was really lucky to have gotten to know him. 

I've been talking to my father a lot more, via e-mail and letters, mostly, and I just don't know what I'd do if he were to die as suddenly as Schodawg did. He is so, so important to me. As is my mother, my brother, and many other people in my life. Sometimes I feel like I take friendships for granted. I hope everyone I care about knows that I care about them. I wouldn't be who I am today without the influence of lots of people. 

Speaking of people I care about, Laurel is coming here today! The bus she was on last night broke down around 10 pm, so she's getting here later than expected, but it shouldn't be too late. I'm so excited. I haven't seen her since December 26th. That's too long. I feel like our relationship thrives when we've got a little distance between us, but 2 months and an ocean apart is a bit much. 

It's lunch time, but I'm not hungry and I still have laundry in the dryer. I'll walk to the dining hall, anyway.

Tonight I'm going to do math homework and trim Kaitlin's hair. Girl's night is Tuesday and volunteering at the Vietnam Vet's center is Wendesday. Laurel may be coming on Friday, but I have to confirm the details with her. 

Life is pretty good here at Wilson. Good people, better food than Hood, and fantastic hiking all around. Friday I went to the coffee house at the cafe here on campus, and in the end it turned into one huuuge dance party. It was pretty indredible. And today John and I absolutely rocked out to Bohemian Rhapsody on the way back from the bookstore. 

I think one of the best things, though, is that if I have anything I need to get off my chest, or if I just feel like I need a hug, I have people everywhere that I can turn to without feeling like I have to explian myself. I had a lot of that in Frederick, but it just seems to be magnified here.

Speaking of Jeff, he's been simply amazing. This is the first relationship I've had that's been so simple and just...nice. He's so very wonderful.

I've been watching the third season of the Golden Girls for the past week and I got the second season from my parents, aaaand the fourth season is en route from the Towson Record and Tape store, so um, I'm gonna be doing good for quite a while. Maybe I'll have a Golden Girls Marathon. It's too bad that I can't get paid to watch my four favorite TV ladies.

Tomorrow I'm getting my first (real) tattoo. I'm excited and nervous.  Hopefully the guy giving it to me won't botch it up or anything. That would suck.

Energy drinks really do seem to work. I have no intentions of drinking another one, though, 'cause they taste awful. 

Sometimes I wish that everything I think could be recorded somehow. Like, every little thing. And then I could go back over it, if I wanted, to remember the really good things that I thought about before. 

Tomorrow I get to see Jeff. I'm excited about that. I am so looking forward to just lying in bed with him while listening to music.

Did you know that when Canada geese honk while flying, it's to encourage the goose that's flying up front? And that if one goose gets injured, two healthy geese will stop migrating to be with injured goose until it gets better?

I wish people were like that.

Aimee, Julia, and Angel are all watching the Victoria's Secret runway show. I don't really get how a woman with a real body and real mind could watch that sort of thing without being offended.

"event","Yesterday was wicked busy, and today hasn't been much different.
Woke up at 5:30 yesterday to go to Michele and Andy's re-affirmation of their wedding vows. It was really, really cold and it rained a little bit, but it was beautiful and my mom and I cried a lot. After we hung out there for a couple hours we went to the LDC in Baltimore and lead a workshop. It was really sort of strange to be there. Only a handful of youth knew me, but almost all of the advisors did. On top of that, LDC had been my first con 5 years ago. Woah. 
Anyway, that went really well and then we drove home and visited with my mom's cousin Eric, who was visiting from Japan. He's really cool. Merrill and I decided that we're going to visit him sometime soon, just the two of us. You know, some awesome sister-brother-second cousin bonding. It's gonna sweet. 
Today I babysat Zoleigh from 10 to 12 and Amelie from 12:30 to 4, and I have work in a half hour. Whew. 
I need to do laundry and make myself some grub to take to work. 
Looove."

On Saturday my dad came over and looked at my computer and the van (I thought there were things wrong with both of them, and they were both okay. Which is good.) and bought me a tank of gas. I love my dad, a lot(and not just 'cause he buys me petrol). He's always so supportive. I really lucked out on the parents deal. Mine are both amazing. 

Speaking of my mom, she called me today and asked if I thought it was a good idea for her to skip her Spanish class. I got a kick outta that. 

I really want to figure out what my interests are. I don't really feel passionate about anything that I could take classes for, and it sort of worries me. I'm supposed to declare a major in 8 months, and I don't even know what I'm interested in. Meh. 

I'll figure something out, I guess.

We went back to Greg's apartment and had (at least!) a four hour dance party. It was prett much amazing. 
Everyone left around 2:30, and then (a drunk)Greg and I talked some while we waited for his friend Grant to go to another party, which was dead by the time we got there. So I drove Greg home and got to sleep sometime around 3:30. Woke up at 11 today. Wicked late for me. 

Today I'm going to do homework and maybe hang out with Greg again before work, then getting off work and calling Meg. Excitiiing. 

And now it's time to take a shower and do some homework, which, of course, will be riveting."

I talked to my amazing friend Frans (with whom I went to third grade) the other day. We've decided that we're going to get married and possibly live in the Netherlands. Sounds good to me.

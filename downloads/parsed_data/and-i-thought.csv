"event","Little known facts. . .


If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days you would have produced enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee.

(Hardly seems worth it.)


If you farted consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough gas is produced to create the energy of an atomic bomb.



(Now that's more like it!)



The human heart creates enough pressure when it pumps out to the body to squirt blood 30 feet.



(O.M.G.!)



A pig's orgasm lasts 30 minutes.



(In my next life, I want to be a pig!)



A cockroach will live nine days without its head before it starves to death. (Creepy.)

(I'm still not over the pig.)



Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour.



(Do not try this at home...... maybe at work.)



The male praying mantis cannot copulate while its head is attached to its body. The female initiates sex by ripping the male's head off.



(""Honey, I'm home. What the....?!"")



The flea can jump 350 times its body length. It's like a human jumping the length of a football field.

(30 minutes... lucky pig... can you imagine??)



The catfish has over 27,000 taste buds.

(What could be so tasty on the bottom of a pond?)



Some lions mate over 50 times a day.

(I still want to be a pig in my next life...quality over quantity)


Butterflies taste with their feet.

(Something I always wanted to know.)



The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue.

(Hmmmmmm........)



Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer than left-handed people.

(If you're ambidextrous, do you split the difference?)


Elephants are the only animals that cannot jump.

(OK, so that would be a good thing....)



A cat's urine glows under a black light.

(I wonder who was paid to figure that out?)




An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain.

(I know some people like that.)



Starfish have no brains.

(I know some people like that too.)


Polar bears are left-handed.

(If they switch, they'll live a lot longer.)


Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for pleasure.

(What about that pig??)

Now that you've smiled at least once, it's your turn to spread the stupidity and send this to someone you want to bring a smile to (maybe even a chuckle)...in other words send it to everyone."

His name is Gossip.
He has no respect for justice.
He maims without killing. He brakes hearts and ruins lives.
He is cunning, malicious and gathers strenght with age.
The more he is quoted, the more he is believed.
He flourishes at every level of society.
Hi victims are helpless.They cant protect them selves againts him because he has no name and no face.
To track him down is impossible.The harder you try, the more elusive he becomes.
He is nobody's friend>
Once he tarnishes a reputation, it is never the same.
He topples governments, and wreckes marriages. HE ruins careers and causes sleepless nights, heartaches and indigestion.He spawns  suspicions and generates rief.He makes innocent people cry in their pillows.Even his name HISSES>
HE is called GOSSIP.Office gossip-Shop gossip-Party gossip-Telephone gossip.He makes headlines and headaches.
REMEMBER, before you repeat a story, ask yourself:is it true?Is it necessary??If not, dont reap it. KEEP QUITE.

GREAT minds discuss ideas...Avearge minds discuss events...Sahllow minds discuss people..Which are you??"

Body: 31 Things Guys Should Know About Girls 
Written by a guy. After years of experience. 

1. Whatever you do, don't just show up at their house...they run around in their underwear just like we do. 

2. Don't cheat on them. It may seem foolproof, but girls tell each other everything about everything. Trust me, they WILL find out and you will be mud. 

3. Beware of every single male relatives and all guy friends. Any of them would kick your butt at the drop of a hat, and a lot of them wouldn't even wait for the damn hat. 

4. Never miss an opportunity to tell them they're beautiful. 

5. Don't refuse to kiss in front of your friends. If they laugh at you, it's because they're jealous. 

6. If they slap you hard, you deserved it. 

7. Don't be afraid to touch them if you want to. If they're going out with you in the first place, it's because they like being in your arms. 

8. If you don't sleep with them, do not tell your friends that you did. 

--8.5. If you DO sleep with them, don't tell your friends that you did. 

9. You can be dirty minded in private, really...most of them are not offended by it... 

10. Not all of them eat like birds, a lot of them can eat like whales. 

11. Most of them don't mind paying half of everything, but they do discuss these things with their friends. Realize that if you make your girlfriend pay half all the time, everyone will know about it and your friends will know you're a pussy. 

--11.5. Do you honestly need all your money that much? Be a man, pay all the time! 

12. Every girl should eventually get three things from her boyfriend- a stuffed animal, one of his sweatshirts, and a really pretty ring. Even if it's not a serious relationship. 

13. Make sure she gets home safely as often as you can. If you're dropping her off, walk her to the door. If you aren't dropping her off, call to be sure she's home safely. 

14. If a guy is bothering her, it is your right to kick the crap out of him. 

15. If you're talking to a female friend of yours, pull your girlfriend closer. 

16. Never, ever slap her, even if it's just in a joking way. Even if she swats you first, and says, ""Oh, you're so dumb"" or something, never make any gestures back. 

17. Go to a chick flick once in a while. She doesn't care whether you enjoy it or not, it just matters that you went. 

18. You're dead meat if you can't get along with their pets, parents and best friends. Be prince charming to their friends, Mr. Polite to their parents, and make sure to be nice to their animals. 

19. Don't flirt with their moms or friends...that's just freaky. 

20. Don't be freaked out by PMS. It's not gross, and it really does make them feel like crap, so be understanding. 

21. If you don't like the way they drive, you do it. 

22. If you're officially dating, and you're introducing her to your friends, you'd better damn well introduce her as your girlfriend. 

23. Don't stress where you go for every date. They really only want to be with you. 

24. If they complain that something hurts, rub it for them without being asked. 

25. Girls are fragile. Even if you're play fighting/wrestling, be very gentle. 

26. Memorize their birthdays. You forget her birthday and you're basically screwed for life. 

27. Don't marinade the cologne. 


28. Don't give her something stupid for her birthday or Christmas or Valentine's day. It doesn't have to be expensive, but it has to be meaningful. Jewelry is always nice. 

29. If you think the relationship isn't going to last, don't wait to find out. It will only hurt you more if you draw it out. 

30. After you've been dating for a while, realize that they really have started to trust you. When you have a girlfriend who truly trusts you, you have a lot more responsibility, privilege and control than you would think. Be careful with it, most guys would kill for that kind of power, and it can be lost in a nanosecond. 

31.Don't ever do anything wrong (well not anything). girls remember things for life and anything you did wrong will be used against you in the future.

"event","Daniel and Jasmine are sitting alone in
the park
one night....

Daniel: I guess we are the left overs in this
world

Jasmine: I think so...All of my friends have
boyfriends and we are only the 2 persons left in
this world with out any special person in our life

Daniel: Yup I don't know what to do

Jasmine: I know! We'll play a game

Daniel: What game?

Jasmine: i'll be your girl friend for 30 days and
you
will be my boy friend

Daniel: That's a great plan in fact i don't have
nothing to do much this following weeks...

DAY 1:

They watch their first movie and they both
touched
in a romantic film

DAY 4:

They went to the beach and have a picnic...
Daniel
and Jasmine have their quality time together

DAY 12:

Daniel invited Jasmine to a circus and they ride
on a Horror House....Jasmine was scared and
she touched Daniel's hand but she touched
someone else's hand and they both laughed...

DAY 15:

They saw a fortune teller down the road and
they
asked for their future advice and the fortune
teller
said: ""My darling, Please don't waste the time
of
your life...SPend the rest of your time together
happily"" Then tears flow out from the teller's
eyes

DAY 20:

Jasmine invited Daniel to go to the hill and they
saw a meteor...Jasmine mumbled something

DAY 28:

They sat on the bus and because of a bumby
road
Jasmine gave her first kiss to Daniel by
accident

DAY 29:

11:37pm

Jasmine and Daniel sat in the park where they
first decided to play this game...

Daniel: I'm tired Jasmine...Do you want any
drinks? I'll buy you one.. I'll just go down the
road

Jasmine: Apple Juice that's all

Daniel: Wait for me....

20mins later... a stranger approached Jasmine

Stranger: Are you a friend of Daniel?

Jasmine: Why yes? What happened?

Stranger: A reckless drunken driver ran over
daniel and he is critical in the hospital

11:57pm

The doctor went out of the emergency room
and
he handed out an apple juice and a letter

Doctor: We found this in daniel's pocket

Jasmine reads the letter and it says:

Jasmine, This past few days, i realized you are
a
really cute girl and i am really falling for you..
Your
cherish smile your everything when we played
this
game..... Before this game would end...I would
like you to be my girl friend for the rest of my
life....
I love you Jasmine....

Jasmine crumples the paper and shouted:

""Daniel ! i don't want you to die... I love
you...Remember that night when we saw a
meteor, I mumbled something... I mumbled
that I
wish we would be together forever and never
end
this game. Please don't leave me Daniel.... I
love
you! You cannot do this to me!""

Then the clock strikes 12

Daniel's heart stop pumping

THEN IT WAS THE 30TH DAY

  A simple friend doesn't know your parents' first

  A simple friend brings a bottle of wine to your
party. A real friend comes early to help you cook and
stays late to help you clean. 

   A simple friend hates it when you call after she has
gone to bed. 
A real friend asks you why you took so long to call.

problems. A real friend seeks to help you with your
problems. 

    A simple friend wonders about your romantic history.
A real friend could blackmail you with it.

real friend opens your refrigerator and helps herself.

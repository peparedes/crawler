<b>Meet Jabba the nut</b>

School bus driver Michael Cianci allegedly used 'Star Wars' characters such as Jabba the Hutt (below) in sicko fight club.

A 38-year-old bald ""Star Wars"" geek who <b>called himself The Emperor</b> formed a fight club on his Staten Island school bus - encouraging kids to descend into the dark side and beat their classmates, authorities said yesterday.

News of the mini Death Star on wheels, where middle school students were pummeled and their clothing was cut with scissors - instead of lightsabers - outraged parents.

Bus driver Michael Cianci created <b>The Death Cheese Club</b> to keep order and gave the toughest of the middle school kids <b>nicknames like Darth, Sith Warrior and Jabba</b>, law enforcement sources said.

The stocky married father of two, who lives with his mother in Parlin, N.J., even posted bizarre rules in the yellow bus titled <b>""Death Cheese Laws,""</b> which were read aloud each day, the sources said.

""The penalty for breaking this code is banishment,"" the laws proclaimed above the signature of ""Lord Matt"" - apparently The Emperor's second in command.

""In a ranking of Master or above, the penalty is death or severe beating . . . \[Heresy\] will not be tolerated.""

The wanna-be storm troopers pounded on weaker kids, dished out noogies and even cut up one another's clothing with scissors.

All the while, Cianci quietly sat up front as though he had the kids in a <b>sick Jedi mind trick</b>, sources said.

"event","The Academy Award nominations are out today and I'm actually surprised that I'm happy about them. This feeling of happiness is so unfamiliar and unsettling to me. 

I totally thought that <i>Munich</i> wouldn't be nominated because it's been shut out of the Guild awards and the Globes but then voila! There it was along with a nod for Spielbergo, Steven's non-union Mexican counterpart! <i>Munich</i> was so moving, thoughtful, funny, slightly scary and possibly my favourite Spielberg movie EVER (Big words but I'm just putting it out there to test the waters) so I'm glad it got some recognition. I know it won't win since everyone seems so intent on licking Ang Lee's arsehole but I still haven't seen <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> so I don't know whether I should join the mob or not. 

But damn....Keira Knightley? Seriously? I haven't seen <i>P&P</i> but I seriously doubt that her performance is up there with Judi Dench and Felicity Huffman. She won't win so I guess I shouldn't be too bothered but still I think it's amazing how many Academy member's her agent had to fuck to get her nominated. It makes absolutely no sense otherwise. Also, if you had told me 5 years ago that Jen Lindley from <i>Dawson's fucking Creek</i> would be nominated for an Oscar I would have had to hold my sides to stop them splitting from the laughter and then throw tiny but painful rocks at you. 

Other people I'm ecstatic about: Fat Clooney! The triple threat! He acts! He directs! He writes! And he does these things well! He's like the Orson Welles of our generation! He's got the fat all sorted out already! I can't stop finishing my sentences with exclamation points! Also I'm excited for Dreamy Jake Gyllenhaal but mostly so I can post this. I also really need to see <i>Jarhead</i>.

I mean I get she doesn't like Ryan but she's Julie Cooper-Nichol people! I expect her to destroy BOTH their lives and the lives of their cherished relatives and pets! Come on Schwartz! You're fucking full of shit. Also, the creepy lesbian vibe I'm getting off Jeri Ryan is skeeving me out. She's looking at her like she's a giant bottle of Jack Daniels and all she wants to do is drink every sweet alcoholic drop out of Kirsten's body. If I am right about this, does that make KiKi the Marissa  and Jeri Ryan the Alex of Season 3? 

In more positive news, Ben McKenzie's bad impression of Summer was fucking hyseterical. Also his new haircut is hot.

Would somebody just send Marissa to prison already? I serisouly don't get why everybody is going out of their way to protect Marissa. She's selfish, the worst friend to Summer and a shitty girlfriend to Ryan and possibly the most boring person since well appropriately enough any of her love interests: Alex, Oliver, Ryan. Fucking just kill her off and make it the Peter Gallagher Eyebrow show already.

Today was very sucessful. Got up early-ish and went to uni with Andy to enroll in my gen ed. Turns out a 48 is not a Fail at this uni (no seriously, what?) which means that I've graduated from uni! SQUEE! This also means that I have to seriously start looking for a job that can provide me 24 hour air conditioning. If I have to suffer through any form of work, I'd rather it be in front of a computer with cable access than a 10 degree refrigerator.  

Also went to Apple and sorted out my power cord problems. The power cord has to go back to Apple and be processed and checked which takes about 5 days which means I have to be Internet-less for 5 days which is ridiculous. So I bought another power cord which I was trying to avoid doing but I seriously can't live without Mary Kate for more than 24 hours. I must have access to Lindsay Lohan news at all times!

I've got The White Stripes tonight which ought to be fun. I hope somebody pisses Jack White off and he assualts someone with the word ""playa"". I also hope that some hipsters show up wearing a top hat. I'll have my camera ready. 

The media people are also getting together tonight for some screening down at George Street which Mitchell and I didn't hesitate saying no to because who wants to hang out in a room of wankers without alcohol. Phfffft. I can imagine showing up and running into That Fat Bitch or Creepy James. Shudder at the thought."

He was trying to be inconspicuous so he sent in his friend to buy tickets while he waited outside by himself oblivous to the masses of people inside (i.e. Bernie and I) who were discussing the deadness of his eyes. The best part is while we were there, not one person except his friend approached him even though there was a pretty full restaurant next door and around a dozen or so people inside the cinema. It turns out that in the venn diagram of art house patrons and Australian Idol fans there isn't really an overlap. I think I might email Sydney Confidential with the sighting. 

Minus the cockroahes in the cinema, <i>Good Luck, and Good Night</i> was brilliant. Who knew Dr Doug knew how to use a camera? The black and white worked really well, the shots were gorgeous and the editing was top notch. It felt just the right length of time, it never dragged and always kept my interest. I didn't even check the time once which is a miracle. I think I checked it close to 78 times during the <i>Narnia</i> a.k.a Poor Man's Lord of the Rings.

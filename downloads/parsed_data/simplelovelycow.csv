"event","It has been a while since i last went for my run. 3 months? Or more than that? SO i decided to put on my running shoes and head for a run today. I must say that my stamina really dropped alot. Looking back at my own records, i used to be able to complete my 4.8km run, and today i only manage to complete 4.2km and i am totally out of breathe to complete the last 600m. 4.8km - 35.44 mins. Today 4.2 km - 38 mins.  I guess i will make a point to go for runs at least twice a week from now on."

"event","Your animal sign is Ox

Your year name is Yi Chou 

The steady female Ox
Quiet, conservative, strong, unromantic, and unsentimental - that's our Ox lady. You have an iron will, a strong sense of responsibility, self-discipline and stout principles. In public, you come across as stoic and seriously determined to pull your weight. You are not the wildly passionate kind, nor are you fashionable or glamorous, though you may be chic and stylish in sensible dressing with a face devoid of make-up. Your charm lies in your strength and reliability. Often viewed as domineering by others, you think of it as being for their own good, though they may think otherwise. Flattery from others does nothing for you. Instead, you are more taken up with people who are trustworthy, prompt and steadfast. Your sense of humor is limited. You hate criticism even when you are wrong and can be extremely unforgiving when you are embarrassed in front of others. 

The wood female Ox.
Tough, strong, domineering, intelligent and capable, you are probably the most formidable of all Ox ladies. You are used to brushing aside your weaker companions and taking over the reins."

"event",""" TEN INTERPRETATIONS TO A HAPPIER LIFE""

1) Cry a river;build a bridge;get over it.
2) Everything happens in its own time.
3) You are the only person who can make yourself happy.
4) Laughter is the best tranquilizer with no side effects.
5) Happiness is a journey, not a destination
6) Do today what others won't so you can live tomorrow like others can't.
7) It is never too late to be what you might have become.
8) Treasure the love you recieved; it will surviv long after your gold and good health has vanished.
9) The journey of a thousanf miles starts with a single step
10)Always have something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.

Let go of past failures, sadness and ppl whom we remember but who no longer care for us. This sounds so easy but its easier said than done. We all have gone through our share of heartaches and sadness. But when we constantly remember the pain and sufferung we had endured, we are allowing htat sadess to gain an upper hand over us. What we must realize is that what happened has happened. Its over and done with. Ppl change and times change. Moving on in life is very difficult but its the first constructive step to a better you."

"event","went to singapore flying club for dinner with kc on sun. it isn't a posh dining place. but wat matter is good food. The place is most famous for their Buffaloe chicken wings. The chicken wings has different level of spicyness. Starting from level 1 to level 16, if i did not rememeber wrongly. And the most spicy level is the chef challenge. Being a chilli lover, i decided to try level 5. Kc tried level 6 before n he advised me to try level 5. I was thinking is there a very big difference in terms of their spicyness. So i asked the waiter, and guess what did the waiter said. ""Oh, i have never tried level 5 and 6 before, i tried level 8 and level 13~!!!"" We were like, OK? Are you trying to tell us something?? haa. In any case, we ordered level 5. Initally when had my first bite, the spiceness was still alright. Taste alright to me and it wasn't as spicy as i tot. After i finished the first wing, i started feeling the burning sensation in my mouth. We ordered half a dozen and we could only finish 4 of it. For chilli lovers, you may wana try it.

bday parties are coming up, one after another....gonna be a busy week ahead...tennis with the usual kakhis tml...and i am gng to see the auditors are tml....wish me luck~!!"

Album:  


I've must have been blind 
Not to see you look away from me
Whenever you say ""You love me still""
I must have been crazy
Not to see you slip away from me
Day after day there's a space to fill
and I can't find the words,to make you fall in love with me agian 
and I can't find the strength to let you go oh oh

And when it's all said and done,you'll be the only one 
Even if there's nothing left for us to say
as sure as the sun will rise I can never say goodbye
Even if we go are separate ways
In my heart you'll always stay 

ooh ooh 

Been spending my time 
to try to remind you of our love
But you're pulling away with every touch
With all we've been though 
I'd never thought i'd be losing you
and i would give everything to keep you here 
But I can't (but I can't) find the words to make you fall in love with me again
and I can't find the strength to let you go oh oh

And when it's all said and done,you'll be the only one 
Even if there's nothing left for us to say (nothing left to say)
as sure as the sun will rise I can never say goodbye
Even if we go are separate ways (ooh)
In my heart you'll always stay 

I,I,I still believe our love meant to be oh 
And it will be here forever come one day (come,one,day) ooh ohoh
can you see? I love you faithfully oh yeh
And one day im telling you I find a way to get back to me ooh

And when it's all said and done,you'll be the only one (said and done)
Oooh,nothing left to say

Distance: 3.15km 
Time: 23 mins

ok i know its pretty slow. But i guess its alright for my standard. After all i have not been running constantly. 

After the run, went home had a nice bathe, headed to sentosa. Met up with the guys at harbour front station. The moment we reached sentosa and after purchasing the tickets, the clouds started tearing. We still went ahead with the plan, went to the new food court for lunch and the sky became clear once we finished our lunch. Enjoyed the day with them. However, just don't understand why i just can't really click with this particular person. Last time, I did tried to strike a few conversation, but i just isn't comfortable. Can someone pls tell me why? haha. Not that i destest her, somehow or rather, just feel abit uncomfortable talking to her. Other than that everything was fine. Nice sun, my face was abit burnt. 

After sentosa, went mushroom spot for dinner. Bennie, yl, joined as well. Mushroom Spot is all about mushroom. 14 of us went there and 6 of us ordered a set meal. Its something like a steamboat. All the different kind of mushroom can be found there. A total of 20+ types of mushroom. hee.

After dinner, 8 of us went for a midnight movie. Pirates and the caribbean. Its a two an a half hours movie. I actually fell asleep twice. Not that the show is boring. I was just freaking tired.

What's my program for todaY? Probably a run later if my body isn't aching that much? Next week wakeboarding session, my dearest penguine bday celebration. Looking forward to it.~!!"

met up with di and her bf (qi aka chicken little) for a quick catch up session today. You guys must be wondering why i call qi chicken little. If you guys see him, you will know why. lol. Apparently he wore a pair of specs which i think its too small for his face. I din say its ugly, its just looks too cute. No offence..And that pair of specs was chosen by my dearest di. hee..

i met lin on my way home and she was running some last min errands before leaving for her bangkok trip. Since i've gt nth to do even if i got home, i accompanied her. Went to the library and borrowed some magazines. I must say it had been donkey years since i last stepped into the library. 

Talking about bangkok, i just came back from bK last week. I must say that it is really fun. SHOPPING SPREE.!! food, shoes, heels, clothes and accessories are fregging cheap there. And the food there are not bad either. If you guys ever go there, you have to try the gultinous rice with mango. Its NICE!~ Have you guys tried squeezing eight ppl in a cab?? If we were to do that in singapore, i guess we will be fine. And guess what, we did that. Eight of us went, eight of us squeeze into a cab. What's even more surprising is that those ""toot toot"", those three wheels vehicle? We actually saw six MAN squeezing into one *toot toot*. Its pretty amazing that the vehicle could take the weight of six MAN exculding the driver.

Song: Notice Me 
Album: Nb Ridaz.com 

Ohh I wanna let you know 
That I'll always love you baby

Sometime I think about 
Everything that we've been through 
And I pray that you would jus open your eyes 
I love you I need you 
So please don't throw our love away 

Since the day you and I snuck away to be alone
I knew from that night something special went on
It must have been the first kiss 
You told me that no one else in the world made you feel this 
I felt the same way too but nothing stays the same
I'm sorry for the tears I'm sorry for the pain 
You were the one that always made things right 
I promise you this though you got a friend for life
Maybe one day we can try it again 
And maybe things can be a little different 
So lets jus kiss and say goodbye 
Cuz I really cant stand the pain of seeing you cry

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me 
I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me

All that's mine is yours that's what I said 
Treat you with love and respect in everyway 
You wanted I gave you need me I was there 
Now you treat like if I'm not here 
I love you and I need you don't wanna let go 
If you want somebody else please let me know 
Can't take it no more I feel in dying inside 
Is this the price I pay for handing you my life? 
I know I'm not prefect but I truly cared 
So when you wake up one morning and I'm not there 
Jus remember I loved you it will never be the same 
Gave you everything and you threw it all away

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me 
I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me

I gave you my good and my bad 
My heart and my soul, 
My trust my money my time, 
What more can you ask from a man 
Even when times are hard 
I held out my arms and held you 
Even excepted you though whatever weather
But now I feel it we're at the end of the rope 
Whatever we had now I gotta let go 
Nights like this I wish raindrops would fall 
To cover my tears 
Wishing I could replace all those wasted years 
Of loving someone who couldn't love me back
And now again I gotta start from scratch 
But I know I've given you my everything 

I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me 
I've given everything 
I loved you endlessly 
But when it comes to me 
You don't even notice me

After the ubin trip, we went to old changi hospital. Nth much happened just that we heard a bit of noise at an area. I guess because we went there quite early, tt's why we did not experience anything. But seriously, i rather nt want to see or experience anything from there. Haha..My friend told me they went there once and just before they left, they actually sense heavy breathing. They quickly left the place and sped off in their car, forgetting to even switch on their headlights. eeerrrieee...

Actually i am quite down on luck. That's why i hestiated to visit the old changi hospital. Firstly i broke my mirror. And it was believed that when one broke a mirror, bad lucks falls on tt person. Don't know if its true. At ubin, i gt abit burnt by my friend's cigar butt. I went over to his side to take a look at the pics we took, and ya, i gt burnt. After that, my sandals strap broke. At first, it was only one side of the strap that came off. But when i climb down from the cliff, and got onto my bike, the other die of the strap came off as well. How wonderful life can be. lol Some picss below...

I wasn't as enthu as before. as i was starting my run,i was deciding on which route to take. To simei or to the park. I usually would take the route to simei without hesitation? Apparently, today, i hesitated and i took the park instead. I don't really like to take the park because the distance is very short as compared to the route to simei. And i have to run rounds to cover the distance that i take to simei. And i just don't get the sense of satisfaction after the run from the park. It is expected that my stamina has drop temendously, and i really mean it. I felt like a heavy toad when i was running. I ran for like only 400m, i was like panting so badly. And my whole run slows down. Though i ran for like 20 mins. I can be very sure tt the distance covered is nt even more than 2.4 km. Tt's bad isn't it? I felt that i haven done enough, when i went back home, i climbed the stairs to the 11th storey and climb back to the 2nd storey. LOL

In any case, i felt a little accomplished, after all, for the past pathetic 2 mths i have not done any excercise at all. 

Met up with the dummies yest. lol. The dove and the duck. Wanted to chill out at indochine. Apparently when we reached the place, all seats were reserved and taken.

"event","went settlers at clarke quay with rh, jj, anna, ryan and jj's friend. It was quite a nice place. Ambience was alright. Definitely a place to de-stress but not a good place for chilling out. The ambience isn't for chilling out because everyone there are playing games and you could imagine how loud people can get if they are excited over certain games, like ""PIT"". haha. 

When i was on my way home yest, mr JJ said tt i had became fairer~!!!!. Is that really true??? Actually come to think of it if i were to put on weight, I deserved it. I did not excerise for months. Where have all my determination gone to? Yesterday, during my journey home, i passed by the route which i used to run and at that point in time, i was so determine that i would head for a run after i reached home. And guess wat, my dad ask me to join them for dinner. Where have my determination gone to??? I will find it back.!


Learn to live life happily. Life is short. Learn to take things at stride. Just do what you want to do and don't regret."

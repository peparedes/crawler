"event","So I thought it was so tight my page said ""Below are the 0 most recent journal entries recorded in mndcntrlnunicrn's LiveJournal"" but now thats all in the past. Ok first I gotta give props where props are due. If it weren't for Stef being married to a six inch mind controlling unicorn this page would never be soo Stef this Bud's for you! Onward and upwards.. here is a summary of a dream i had. So I was at Adventurland with my dad who is far from being a midget..he's 6'6"" so he keeps like NOT going on rides with me so im like fine get popcorn and meet me at the sea lion sho ( which in real life doesn't exist) so I'm saving us seats when my dad comes back dressed as big bird. I'm not talking about thoes costumes that hide your face either, it's one of thoes kiddie ones where you can see who's inside. Yeah.. thats it. I told my dad my dream too, all he sais was "" guess what I was at Adventureland with Lee ( my 3 year old brother) today..whoa for coincidence but i mean the man totally ignored the fact that he was dressed at a giant bird. And I'm spent."

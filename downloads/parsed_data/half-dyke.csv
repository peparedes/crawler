I haven't forgotton about them, as much as I would like to. The truly scary thoughts have just recently come to mind. I was able to let go of Jonathan because I knew he had every right in the world to hate me, but I had forgiven myself for the mistakes I made. I have been able to feel nothing for him but the slight annoyance at his stupidity. Is this how Nina feels about me? Is this why she never even feigned an attempt? If so..then I know that there could be no way to reconcile, as I could never see Jonathan and I being able to be friends again. I just thought we had a deeper relationship than that. I really hate having to deal with this shit all over again. I just want to be able to enjoy the wonderful life I now have for myself without all of this bullshit. Have I killed myself yet? HAH. No way in hell I'd give up all I have goin for me. It's just a shame everything had to go sour between all of us in order for me to get where I am today. I do miss the friendships I have lost.

I don't think we've spent more than 24 hrs away from each other since the summer began. Now we have to get used to a whole week. Why does love come at such a price? Such agony for such rapture. It's like a drug, and I have an addictive personality...so says my last counselor. I pray that this will become easier- having to say goodbye to the one I love over and over again. I'm so afraid that I will fuck up the best thing I could have ever imagined. I wanted so badly to be able to fix myself before entering another relationship, but believe that this is what was meant to be. They always say you find true love when you arent looking for it...I just know that I'm totally ill-prepared. Why does fate always add a fucked up twist to everything? I just need something to numb the pain I feel right now. The true remedy has left and is currently living in Bowling Green. Why wont the sun hurry and signal a new day, one closer to that upon which I will be reunited with my other half?"

This reminds me of camp. All the fond memories of Sycamore Hills will forever be tainted by my this past summer. Though I had previously been exposed to a fair amount of bullshit in the way that things tended to happen at camp, never did I truly imagine that such ignorant hypocrisy could actually manifest itself  at a place so devoted to ""growing on the inside by being outside."" Though with the scarce amount of respect, trust, and freedom that was given, I don't know why I ever expected anything more.

Girl Scout Promise (which we recited every day at flag): On my honor, I will try to serve God and my country,to help people at all times*,and to live by the Girl Scout Law.
*In the event that you must make a minor infraction to a camp rule in order to hold true to this Promise, you will be punished for doing what is right.

Obviously, they forgot to clue me in on that last bit. Guess they assumed that a group of young, philanthropic women would stop at nothing to get the job done. How they could expect anyone to sit back and do nothing to help someone you had been working closely with for two months is beyond me. I also don't understand how camp life...can be disconnected from your personal life, at least to the point where if you saw a loved one loaded in an ambulance, you wouldn't need more than an hour or so to return to one of the most stressful working environments imaginable. If anyone who has worked at camp could please explain that one to me, I'd be most appreciative.

Damn me for having a heart full of love that commands me to stand up for what I know is right."

For some reason I felt this epiphany was beautiful and continued to gaze at the plant, not even caring of the fact I didn't know which, for awhile longer. These are the feelings I feel seperate me from some people. Not many see the beauty (and humor) in simplicity. Sometimes, this is all that gets me through the day.

How long have you secretly felt this affection towards my own? Why did you act upon it. And how can you possibly concieve of the thought that I would actually ever want to speak to you again. You threw away a friendship I thought was good. Your actions have proved otherwise, and I thank you. Thank you for showing me now what kind of a friend you are. I should have learned the first time. I knew then. But I thought that by changing your father's mind about who stole the money, you had shown enough initiative to rectify the damage that had been done.

And I cant just ignore any of it."

A plan is always good to have. Gives you something to look foward to."

I know he could have, though- he talked to Nina. I drank many Red Bulls and Starbucks double shot frapiccino things. I became very hyperactive/ delerious. I finished studying w/Logan. I think I will do well. I smoked a bowl. I was given a like 12-14 oz beer. I am mellow and hyper at the same time. I know thats completely oxymoronic...but oh well."

"event","""It's Not Unusual""

It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
but when I see you hanging about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry,
oh I wanna' die
It's not unusual to go out at any time
but when I see you out and about it's such a crime
if you should ever want to be loved by anyone,
It's not unusual it happens every day no matter what you say
you find it happens all the time
love will never do what you want it to
why can't this crazy love be mine
It's not unusual, to be mad with anyone
It's not unusual, to be sad with anyone
but if I ever find that you've changed at anytime
it's not unusual to find out that I'm in love with you
whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

"event","I don't feel like the star anymore; I'm just a blurred character in the background. I think of all the special things I once had and wonder if they ever truly were for me. Everything that once was feels as though it was never meant to be as special as I thought it was. I feel like a fool, a jelous fool. I wish I could just divert my attention to the other and feel rage and hatred, but this could never be- it's not her fault. I don't feel as though I belong anywhere now. I have no place where everything is ok, no matter what. I wish it didn't hurt because it shouldn't. But then again, I do have my  justified reasons. The others I'm sure are overanalyized exaggerations.
Either way, the pain is real and I wish it'd go away."

"event","Rain used to be kinda cool. You could run outside, get wet, and then run back in to dry off. Now that running isnt possible and crutches tend to not have so much traction...I don't like the rain so much. Falling from time to time can be funny...but falling every time it rains makes it hard to get yourself out the door. It floods when it rains on campus. This makes biking through puddles an adventure b/c you never know how hight he splash will go!
Damn rain- go away!!!!!
Paula made a big step today in asserting herself :) She wrote a note telling her roommate to take out the trash...and the roommate complied. Paula is very excited about this new development."

My eyes are still burning, too.
Ok, I'm done pouting.
After sitting somewhat patiently for 40 min in the waiting room, and with some difficulty, I had my cast taken off. Despite the gastly appearance of my leg, it was glorious. I still cant put much weight on it- so no walking. Cructhes...for another 2 weeks min. I think I have some nerve damage under my right arm; if my cast hits a certian place just right, it causes excrutiating pain...and I've gotten better about my hypochondria..."

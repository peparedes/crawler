"event","so its been a while since ive written in here. hm. well, the past month has been an exciting one, i must say. full of more happiness, sadness, excitement, rejection, acceptance, and surprise than i could have thought possible. i am both greatful and resentful for this. its left me in a place ive never been before; a place where im not sure whats what. the only thing i can say that i know for sure anymore is that i have a lot to learn. im having trouble articulating what this feels like, probably because ive never felt it before. now that i think about it, this whole entry is probably making me sound ridiculous, so ill just leave the rest in my head before i confuse you any further.


on a less vague note, i just found out that one of my all time favorite musical artists is actually coming here. =]"

"event","so i think this past weekend will be the last time i take part in anything one typically associates with 'partying'. sure, it can be fun. but i miss the kind of fun i had that i didnt end up feeling guilty for. but the only problem with that is that a lot of my friends do those kind of things pretty much on a regular basis. i feel like if i stop, i'll stop being part of our group of friends. i never actually understood the concept of peer pressure until now. its not so much people telling you ""hey do this if you want to hang out"". its more like a personal feeling. no one is making me do anything, yet i feel like i have to. i hate this feeling and i wish i was strong enough to make the right decision. i just dont want to lose my friends."

"event","<p>i was supposed to get off work today at&nbsp;7 but my manager let me go early at 6. and jackie, tommy, and john happened to come&nbsp;in at 6 to say hey and so i was able to sit and talk with them for a bit before returning to hell....i mean home. groundation pretty much sucks because i have to hear about all the fun stuff everyone is doing and all the places theyre going and all the kids theyre hanging out with and it makes me sad. oh well. i guess technically i deserve my punishment, but in my opinion, my mom is over reacting. grounded for probably the whole summer over one stupid glass of gin and vault. its not like i was partying, its not like i had people over that i wasnt supposed to, its not like i was shitfaced, and i was with my 19 year old sister. it really wasnt a big deal at all and shes treating me like i just commited the worst crime in the world. is it just me, or wouldnt you say thats a bit extreme?</p>"

we went on an adventure through the woods where this really creepy girl in the woods was yelling at us and telling us that there were jaguars back there that wanted to eat us. and kept asking if we were trying to kill ourselves because she was serious. and then she started to come down her hill and out into the woods as if to follow us and she just kept yelling. so we ran the rest of the way out. it was crazy!

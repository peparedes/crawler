Me and melissa hung out all weekend this week..end..lol OMG the funniest thing happened to her. We were taking a walk and there was this big hill and shes like ""oo katie lets go down it' and i was like"" You can but im not gonna"" so she starts to slowly walk down it then slips and falls on her ass and gets all muddy. she started to climb back up and sat down and i walked where she was and started laughing my ass off...i swear if i laughed any harder then i did there would have been 2 muddy girls sitting in the grass. So i helped her wrap her coat around her waist and then someone was like oh hey (i knew her) and melissa looked at me like *wat the hell im all muddy i wanna fucking go home ahhh grr* it was so funny then while we were walking home shes like ""ewww katie my butt is all icky"" it was hystericl. well thats all i have to say for tonite i mite update soon.

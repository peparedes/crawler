"event","Jay Leno puts it into perspective and makes us think about the pathetic negativity. 

 


it's the Jay Leno we don't often see.... 

""The other day I was reading Newsweek magazine and came across some poll data I found rather hard to believe. It must be true, given the source, right? 

The Newsweek poll alleges that 67 percent of Americans are unhappy with the direction the country is headed, and 69 percent of the country is unhappy with the performance of the President.  In essence, 2/3's of the citizenry just ain't happy and want a change. 

So being the knuckle dragger I am, I started thinking, ''What are we so  unhappy about?''< /SPAN> 

Is it that we have electricity and running water 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? 

Is our unhappiness the result of having air conditioning in the summer and heating in the winter? 

Could it be that 95.4 percent of these unhappy folks have a job? 

Maybe it is the ability to walk into a grocery store at any time, and see more food in moments than Darfur has seen in the last year? 

Maybe it is the ability to drive from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean without having to present identification papers as we move through each state? 

Or possibly the hundreds of clean and safe motels we would find along the way that can provide temporary shelter? 

I guess having thousands of restaurants with varying cuisine from around the world is just not good enough. 

Or could it be that when we wreck our car, emergency workers show up and 
provide services to help all, and even send a helicopter to take you to the hospital. 

Perhaps you are one of the 70 percent of Americans who own a home. You may be upset with knowing that in the unfortunate case of a fire, a group of trained firefighters will appear in moments and use top notch equipment to extinguish the flames thus saving you, your family and your belongings. 

Or if, while at home watching one of your many flat screen TVs, a burglar or prowler intrudes , an officer equipped with a gun and a bullet-proof vest will come to defend you and your family against attack or loss. 

This all in the backdrop of a neighborhood free of bombs or militias raping and pillaging the residents.  Neighborhoods where 90 percent of teenagers own cell phones and computers. 

How about the complete religious, social and political freedoms we enjoy that are the envy of everyone in the world? 

Maybe that is what has 67 percent of you folks unhappy. 

Fact is, we are the largest group of ungrateful, spoiled brats the world has ever seen. No wonder the world loves the U.S. , yet has a great disdain for its citizens. They see us for what we are. The most blessed people in the world who do nothing but complain about what we don't have , and what we hate about the country instead of thanking the good Lord we live here. 

I know, I know. What about the President who took us into war and has no plan to get us out? The President who has a measly 31 percent approval  rating? Is this the same President who guided the nation in the dark days after 9/11? The President that cut taxes to bring an economy out of recession? Could this be the same guy who has been called every name in the book for succeeding in keeping all the spoiled ungrateful brats safe from terrorist attacks? 

The Commander-In Chief of an all-volunteer army that is out there defending you and me? Did you hear how bad the President is on the news or talk show? Did this news affect you so much, make you so unhappy you couldn't take a look around for yourself and see all the good things and be glad? 

Think about it..are you upset at the President because he actually caused you personal pain OR is it because the ""Media"" told you he was failing to kiss your sorry ungrateful behind every day. 

Make no mistake about it. The troops in Iraq and Afghanistan have volunteered to serve, and in many cases may have died for your freedom. There is currently no draft in this country. They didn't have to go. 

They are able to refuse to go and end up with either a ''general'' discharge, an ''other than honorable'' discharge or, worst case scenario, a ''dishonorable'' discharge after a few days in the brig. 

So why then the flat-out discontentment in the minds of 69 percent of  Americans?  Say what you want, but I blame it on the media. If it bleeds, it leads; and they specialize in bad news. Everybody will watch a car crash with blood and guts. How many will watch kids selling lemonade at the corner? The media knows this and media outlets are for-profit corporations. They offer what sells , and when criticized, try to defend their actions by ""justifying"" them in one way or another. Just ask why they tried to allow a murderer like O.J. Simpson to write a book about ""how he didn't kill his wife, but if he did he would have done it this way""...Insane! 

Stop buying the negativism you are fed everyday by the media. Shut off the TV, burn Newsweek, and use the New York Times for the bottom of your bird cage.  Then start being grateful for all we have as a country. There is ex ponentially more good than bad. 

We are among the most blessed people on Earth, and should thank God several times a day, or at least be thankful and appreciative. 

""With hurricanes, tornados, fires out of control, mud slides, flooding, severe thunderstorms tearing up the country from one end to another, and with the threat of bird flu and terrorist attacks, ""Are we sure this is a good time to take God out of the Pledge of Allegiance?""

"event","I don't think i could be any more frustrated by these essays for medical school applications.  Each essay requires some strange off the wall essay, and I'm just stuck in a rut over it.  I wish I could just pick one, do the stuff, and go there without having to go through all this bureaucracy.  The process forces everyone to apply to too many, forcing the acceptance rates to plummet because every school is getting overrun with applicants.  I know it would be so much simpler if I just buckled down and did it, but writing essays always grates on my mind, and that doesnt mesh so well with the whole rolling-deadline thing (I should get them in as soon as possible)..."

"event","SO Tara and I went off down to West Virginia, and it was quite fun.  Among the things learned/done:

     Saw ancient burial mounds from 250 BC - learned we can't climb the mound :(

     Tried to get into prison - got kicked out.  It opens in April, so we should all go for a tour together, it's a very awesome looking prison, but is right in the middle of the town - yay property values

     learned that Tara has a special procedure for turning a turn signal off - one must first turn off the radio, put the wipers on, turn the lights on, and roll down the window before it is ok to remember how to turn it off.

     Learned that Tara doesnt appreciate waiters calling her ma'am or saying ""wow! that's a bigger burger than i could ever eat!!!""

     Learned that Tara thinks I am a frog/cow/baby alien/penguin/kitten/beta/beagle 

     Luke learned the joys of shopping and Steve and Barry's, where everything is 7.98, including hoodies, pants, etc

     Saw ""the Taj Mahal of America"" - A Hare Krishna temple/monument.  Tara then defiled a Hare Krishna woman in her sacred place (she was tying her shoe as she drove past, thus mooning her near the temple).
          On the walk around the temple, there was a gorgeous peacock sitting out in the wild in front of some naked women statues, and a beautiful white peacock and peahen.  Then there was a pair of swans sitting in a puddle, who gave us the bird.  Or they just flapped their wings.  This all happened past where the sidewalk ends.  Twice.  Literally the road to this place was so in the middle of nowhere that the road had washed out twice.  Besides that, it was a very beautiful temple."

While it seemed incredibly awesome, I was unable to secure myself a seat for it.  A while ago I stumbled across the <a href=""http://www.io.com/~sj/PirateGame.html"" target=""_blank"">directions</a> and now I've taken it into my silly head that eventually I'll be able to host such an event, with each person starting out with a small ship on the open seas.

"event","Ok guys, it feels like it's been a year since that last post!

(real post time)

Tara and I were going to head down to Wheeling, West Virginia.  It's an hour and a half from Irwin, ~2 1/2 hours from Y-town.  There's some pretty cool stuff there if some people want to join us.  Tara was looking at a Civil War area prison that looks like it would have some awesome architecture, and Burial mounds from 250 BC plus a bunch of <a href=""http://wheelingcvb.com/attractions.html"">other stuff</a>.  We're staying over Sat night.  IM me or something if you might be interested - My cell phone number is 908-294-0301 since i still havent gotten around to changing it to a PA number.  

So for the awful string of 5 midterms I had just before our short 4 day break, I actually came out of them quite nicely (with some generous curves from Dr. Weber).  For as impossibly hard as Anatomy and Physiology and Cardiopulmonary Physiology are, I actually feel like I'm getting smarter for all the gruel Dr. Weber's putting us through.  

Over our break Gospel Team went up to Rochester/Syracuse NY area for our Tour, where we did a bunch of service projects/services/general bible study and praise singing and group bonding.  It was lots of fun.
The next monday we did nothing but praise songs instead of our music practice, and i think it touched all of us, and Mallory in GT did a bible study from Isaiah, and now I want to read through Isaiah, but I never find time to...

So I'm nearing the end of the 4th book of the Otherland series that Rozy recommended to me forever ago, it is such an awesome series, I recommend it to all of you (Tad Williams, first one is City of Golden Shadow)

and hey, i might even start posting in this thing more than once a year"

"event","Recently I ordered a number of Dungeons and Dragons miniatures, and they should be arriving sometime soon.  Now these miniatures can run pretty pricey $12-15 a box, or $20 for the giants of legend.  I was able to get them en masse for $8.50 a box and $14 for the Giants of Legend containing a HUGE miniature (anything from Giants to Demons and bigggg Dragons).  The regular boxes contain 8 medium/large miniatures.  The Giants contain 9, 1 of them being a huge.  They are random with 5 commons, 2 uncommons, and a rare, plus a second potential rare in the giants of legend.

If anyone is interested in getting in on this gaming goodness, please contact me.  The miniatures are beautiful and really help bring the game to life, and the miniatures game itself is a lot of fun too

When he got better, he was missing a ton of memories and his personality was different.  He refused to go to the hospital until recently.  They just discovered there is a very large malignant tumor and will be operating tomorrow.  Please keep her, her father, and her whole family in your prayers.  

They are much appreciated."

"event","Ayyyup.  Life is pretty good.  Classes are over so i need to spend the next 2 days doing nothing but studying for Ochem with a smattering of physics in there somewhere.  Not like it'll help.  he gives us all the formulas, and so all you really have to do is put them together as needed as the need arises.  No clue what to even study for that... blah...

But then i have nothing until 2 finals on Tuesday, and that's my easy classes - gonna reaaally be motivated to use that time wisely!

didn't do well enough on the last ochem test - gonna end up with a B in all probability.  All the studying i did for this, just to have this be my low test that gets dropped anyway.  

Not to be a sap, but it's weird how I was looking for love, and instead it found me.  I just love Tara so much, we mesh so well.  I guess before this I never really realized how important it is to be able to just be yourself.  She is just so wonderful, laughs at my stupid jokes just the right way, laughs at me and my idiocies just the right way, smiles in so much better than just the right way.  
After the formal dance on Saturday, we were driving and a pair of deer leapt out in front of us.  As i braked, we hit this patch of ice and went skidding into a ditch.  Tara's cell phone couldn't pick up anyone, so we spent the next few hours trying to call Alex, Ryan, and Anna to tell them where we were to get a tow truck, finding out our location from a trio of travelers, a plow truck dude, a hefty computer geek, and what struck me as a child rapist (we kinda let him continue on his way after not too long...)  So that finally gets through and they reach AAA, and call back to say there is a 1-2 hour delay on the tow truck.... So we finally get back to campus a 7 30am, still wearing our formal wear from the night before :-p

It just seems with how splendidly we handled the catastrophe, we could weather anything together.  And in the end, the AAA didn't cost anything (wouldn't even take a tip) and it looks like the car wasn't damaged - lucky since it looked like both axles were touching the gound.  

And a special heartfelt thanks to Alex, Anna, and Ryan who forewent sleep just to extricate us from this situation!  wonderful friends, we salute you!"

best part -> being completely unable to stop laughing when the rest of the audience is silent... yay for geek jokes!!

fun times with people not recognizing me and all the compliments that go along with that.  After two of the plays Tim turns around and says ""you got your haircut... i just noticed... and i talked to you for 10 minutes...""  and also fun with people smiling and waving at you and catching that small glimmer that they have no clue who you are (haha ms welsh) 

""and since the 4th member of whose line is it anyway randomly died, we'll select someone from our studio audience""
""how are ya doin, Paul, naw just kidding, come here Seth""
***Seth fumes***

Tons o fun at rozy's - think that was the most people at a rozy party we've had for a while, if ever.  so much fun talkin with all of you til 5.. 
again again!! 

So the next day Pahla and Ivan showed me Lost.  The TV show is very awesome, it's about a plane that crashes on a tropical island somewhere around Fiji, and it has the perfect mix of reference to literature and original stuff, one of the most well read shows that's come out in a while.  The particular piece of literature... can you guess it?  Lord of the Flies baby... anyway, check out www.televisionwithoutpity.com if you'd like to know more.. it's really worth it

So Lynn was originally gonna give me a ride back to gcc as she came from cleveland at around 2 or 3.  Then she calls and says is 6 30 ok, then calls and says is 7 30, then at about 8 30 calls and says she'll be there in 40 minutes... but it's ok, i'm sure i didn't need that studytime anyway (but i did get crazy physics done).  oh well, it was appreciated anyway 

so now i'm back at gcc not studying as i should for o chem death on wednesday..."

"event","Wow... odd day today, let me just start out by saying Tara rocks.

So over the past couple of days, i start getting this major toothace in the same tooth that i had that ""incident"" with last year, what with the chip and all.  Well anyway that chip got fixed but there was a tiny miniscule chip right along the gumline, and so my guess was that a cavity started up there and had a free ride to the soft fleshy interior of happiness and utter pain.  

It's pretty much been a perfect yet infinitesimally slow crescendo of pain, and no ibuprofin et al didn't help, up to the point where i was taking 1d6 sanity damage an hour.  Now this is the tooth that was said might need a root canal back last year, so by this point i was pretty much certain of it.

Then this morning, I randomly go back to my room between classes because i forgot something there, trying to get in contact with my mom to arrange something, rides and all to get down there, when i realize that she's on vacation already... i thought that wasn't until later but oh wel..

Tara IMs me, telling me to be happy, and i kind of oh so casually mention my need for that root canal i was resigned to, and eventually offers to give me a ride there!  We find his number and there's actually a free slot at 2:15, and so we both skip a class, Tara [(the prez of GT, our singin group) giving me a huge portion of her day] and I make it to good ol' Gi-rard in time for fun and loathing in Luke's mouth. 

The whole process is going well and relatively painless, ya know watching an awesome star trek episode (kind of a mystery one with Data, I always see all the clues, always identify which ones are the important ones, and then miss the answer to the riddle).  

So then Macguyver comes on, and I'm trying really hard to watch it to not pay attention to what's happening in real life, and this guy's leg gets mangled and (almost as Totally Rad as Jenna) Macguyver tries to set the bone, and beforehand tells him this really convoluted thing to think about, like ""The inverse receptors on the capacitators are etc etc"" right as the Dentist says ""this is going to hurt"" and they both immediately (not giving time to think about it) do the heinous pain-ensuing action.  
Now at this point, my mind perfectly schismed in three ways, 
part of my mind saying ""hahahaha, isn't that funny that i was just thinking how easy this was""
part of my mind saying ""hahahaha, isn't that funny how perfectly in time that was""
and the rest of my person just kinda going into complete and total pain/shock as hot Thermafill surged into the space where my nerve was a few minutes earlier.  Yea... that part's pretty bad, it felt as if he grabbed hold of my nerve and just started pulling with a foot against my face for good leverage.

But all in all, the pain is now good, and i might even be able to eat now!! yay me!!"

"event","oooooooook.... I would like to posit to all of you a scenario that I just witnessed.  My mother, sister and I were on the road heading home just now and on the side of the highway we see flashing police lights.  As we approach it, we see the police officer walking AWAY from his car - very confusing.  Then we see the car in front of the police car.  And from a perfectly straight line on or near the bumper, there is a cascade of green, slimey, vegetable stalactite matter that looked remarkably like seaweed.  Now I ask all of you, WTF, mate?!?! 

Some possible solutions proposed: The car ran off the side of the road and got plants in his bumper, however the plants looked nothing like any wet soggy veggies that were around.

- the alien green slime mold took over the police officer's body and he is now escaping the scene of the crime to reek havoc on our puny human world.  This is why Pahla insisted we call the police and inquire into the safety of our police officer.  

- The dispatcher was aware of the situation and told us the car was a victim of a hit and run, thus the police officer may have been searching for evidence of the other car, hubcap, paint etc.  This could have caused the trauma to the car, causing some substance to leak out

- Thus, it may be antifreeze, soap or laundry detergent leaking out.  However, i distinctly remember no puddles underneath the very solid mass trailing from this car.  I am unaware of any liquid substance that could harden so.  please tell me if you can think of anything in the car that could form so.  

- Mint ice cream.  See above statement

- soggy marijuana.  The police would have called for more backup.  

- The car who hit this one was actually made of vegetable matter.

- I personally do not remember seeing any damage to the car whatsoever, nor did any of us see any other people, as we were focused on the slime.  This evidence lends credence to the alien theory, and leads me to believe the dispatcher has already been taken over by an alien host as well.  

Now, since Pahla works in a law office, she can request the police transcripts of the event, so i shall tell more at a later date, if we, witnesses of the event, have not been assimilated by then.


This is seriously what just happened folks, what do you think happened???"

"event","I had a very strange dream just now... I was at my mother's wedding, and I was looking at some names or a roster or something, and saw my sister's name Carina on some list type thing, and perhaps because she wasn't there, I instantaneously burst out crying, and i ran out of the sanctuary into the nursury of my church (different church) and instead of crying my nose was bleeding, and i was getting really frustrated because it was getting on my tux/suit by running down my arms and i was almost stopping it, and then my pastor walks in and says this wedding is secondary, you need to focus on your mission immediately, get back out there and start watching.  So i go back out (i'm fine now, my hands are just a little bloody, but nobody cares).  now i'm an old asian guy walking down these stairs and i start talking to people trying to find the assassin (not for anyone specific as far as i can tell) and I start talking to this one guy, and i can tell it's not him, then i'm by this other guy walking down the stairs and i start bringing up all these really strange things trying to tell by his answers if he's hiding anything, and i trip him as we're going down the stairs, and he does this really slow motion roll and lands perfectly upright. so i start talking ""oohh, did you take ninja class? you very good, i took one year.. umm, judo.. no,... umm (now we're walkng through some bazaar thing, and i see a medieval table) ooh, tha's what it was, i take knight swordfighting one year!"" he just kinda looks at me, and we get into this huuuuge fight and it was really awesome, and i'm fuzzy about the fight, but i think it went through tunnels and such, and parking decks, or maybe that was later... but anyway, i'm chasing him down this street with this black woman, I think it might've been Jera Day, but i'm not sure, and she loops around in front of him (or maybe i was the black lady, i can't tell now) and chucks this bottle of perfume at him, which he deftly catches as the ninja he is, then somehow i'm in front of him too, and he throws it at me, but i dodge and as he keeps running after me he goes through the plume of smoke created when it hit the road, and is knocked unconscious.  i leave her and end up in this huge parking deck, thousands of cars, looking for my car (if it's even there, i doubt i could've found it) and i see Ryan Yee (junior here) who has a wife and 2 kids.  i beg them to take them with me because i don't know where i am in Pittsburgh, and i don't know anybody's cell numbers, and everyone whose number i do know is on the road from the wedding.  He keeps saying he can't take me to any of these places because he's in such a rush.  I think he might've said my house was a week out of the way, but i didn't even understand that in my dream.  So then he drives off and i'm just kinda standing there (i'll say it was raining for dramatic effect).  So i just kinda wander around the city and i end up at this high school fundraising carnaval, and with the last of my money (even though i said i had 20 bucks earlier) i buy this really crappy noodle burger or something like that, i think i left despondantly before i even got it.  So i go and sit down and this random kid is walking by me, and i think hey, kids don't have cell phones but oh well, and ask him if he has one.  Then he says ""see i knew there was a reason Tom Savu sent me here!!! (a guy that used to go to my church) and i'm just kinda dumbfounded and i give the kid a big hug and wake up as he hands me his cell phone."

"event","Today was really tiring.
I got out of bed really late because my alarm clock has broken and I cannot afford a new one at the moment.

I feel unusual because my antidepressants are making me hairy.

I'm so sad. My kitten got run over this afternoon. I found him when I was coming home from school. His head was all squished. I took some photos. I'll miss him. Poor kitty.

Last night I had to shave my entire body. Apparently, the lice that I caught from Amanda's friend are really hard to get rid of. I look quite strange with no hair and eyebrows. I'd post pictures, but my webcam is broken.

I want to tell the world that I love you all! You're all so special to me!

I am sharpening my knives before I go to work today, because I'm going to cut out Robert's heart and feed it to him for losing my mail. 

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! Here's ten thousand photographs of my cat.

I want to say thanks to simon and Abbey and Dave and the other Simon for helping me on Saturday. You guys are the best. By the way, if you happen to find my wallet, keys or underwear, could you SMS me? Adrian has my number. 

I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have a terrible skin disease which prevents me from coming into contact with other human beings. And bipolar disorder.

You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you what your favourite sexual position is.

That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with some naked photos of myself. (Not safe for work - teehee).

"event","Guys.... I seriously think we as the human civilization are in some serious trouble... 
I really want you guys to all check this out.   He raises some very serious issues that are almost upon us about the Peak Oil Crisis which will lead to the collapse of our oil-based culture.  

When we hear oil crisis the ONLY picture that comes to mind is rising gas prices.  I did not realize that every aspect of production comes directly from oil.  As gas prices soar as oil becomes more and more difficult to mine, the cost of food production, plastic production, and the basic costs of life are going to soar tremendously.  
""Oil based agriculture is primarily responsible for the world's population exploding from 1 billion at the middle of the 19th century to 6.3 billion at the turn of the 21st.""  Tractors, food storage, food transportation... all directly based on oil production.  Guess what happens to those 5.3 BILLION people when the availability of oil slowly diminishes and diminishes as need continues to skyrocket... We're approaching the downward slope of Rome guys... 

But hey, at least we have renewable energy sources that can take oil's place.... if only it didn't take huge amounts of oil to get those projects further off the ground than the few % of energy they produce.

it's obvious how much we are dependant on oil as the fake oil crisis of the 1970s hurt our economy....

and it isn't just this guy raving... ""Some of the most respected, highest paid geologists and experts in the world"" are making these claims

I really think this is serious guys, spread the word

"event","Well, as I'm sure most of you have heard by now, I'm now going out with Ruth Dykstra, a beautiful and wonderful girl.  She's from the Boston area, I met her through Mike and all his band friends.  Life is wonderful, despite whatever grade i'll get on those chem and psych tests.  Back in October, Pat, who i've mentioned, had a bit of a thing for her, but i really don't know what's with him.  Well, whatever happened and he basically just pushed her away for no reason (which I'm perfectly fine with) but of course he feels all left outta the loop and all this crap and basically continually blames her for any rift in the friendship which is bull, so she tells him we're goin out and of course he has the expected despondent reaction, at least it was lacking in the violence department... so perhaps he'll accept stuff and that'll be the end of that but i don't really care as long as he doesn't give us flak... oh well... life goes on, eh?  

So I asked her out Saturday, a while before I left with Gospel Team to do a church service in Cleveland... didnt make the car trip go any faster... oh well.  But i was navigator codriver for a very crazy Nick, so that was fun, just a little aggravating to the other cars in the caravan *innocent look*.  GT is a singin group and it's lotsa fun, played piano for one of the songs, sightread it last monday, and played it jus fine whee (pretty hard parts too).  


...that i be graced with such a beauty...

So at lunch the oh so wondrous food devolves into the usual mess, and I muse, pondering the percentage of trays that come through with various levels of ""artwork"" on them, and Anna says that her mom still hasn't developed the pictures of this creation we made before break.  It was a pretty awesome sculpture, maybe i described it before, but there was a ton of symbolism which I shall develop fully when i can finally post the pictures of it.  Well anyway, earlier Anna was wondering what her dad would think if she called and asked him what he thought of being a grandpa (for no reason).  So Matt asks if this creation was why her dad was gonna be a grandpa... and i can't help but say it was Derek and I that did the bulk of the 'creating' (ooh sidebar, i need to borrow/get Bad Taste to show him, if not just for that one line ""I'm a Derek..."")  Matt wonders if there were others involved.  ""well, Anna and Jenny were BOTH ""taking pictures"" (nudgenudgewinkwinkknowwhatimeanknowwhatimean).  So apparently Jenny's dad's gonna be a grandpa too i guess.  i dunno...  I think that coupled with strange IMs about quantum weapons i built was responsible for 2 of the 3 marks i got...


Just before dinner i was watching an episode of Naruto, this anime about a young ninja and stuff and I ran across one of the most bizarre events, and i even learned a bit of common sense along the way.  The main character has a bit of an upset stomach from some spoilt milk he drank, but is fighting this guy in the training school, and uses a special shadow replication technique to clone himself a bunch, but then all 5 of him get hit with diarrhea at the same time, so all five of them run off and then are fighting for the bathroom at the same time.... along with bubbahotep, something that will never ever be done again in film....."

A big loss in entertainment i'm sure (me coming back or me being gone... i don't know which).  


I'm thinking all of my classes are going to be rather easy this semester, except for Cell Biology.  Apparently we're using the MBoC - molecular biology of the cell - a book that is mainly used in graduate programs, and i think Sodergren said that no other colleges use it at a freshman level.  Oh joy of joys.... But at least class was canceled today, I think he's sick or something, and he won't be there mon either.  The problem book is a very scary thing, and i could definately see a glint of evil in his eyes as he described it to us - this quiet mild man.  One of my friends counted the umms he said in the first class, and it was approaching 700 in the 50 minute class... that's one umm every 4.29 seconds, but something's wrong with that kid anyway since he's taking 4 sciences, each with a 2-3 hr lab.  And while taking this class may kill me, at least I've got a weekend every other day so i can recuperate.  I was going to have my HUMA class TR, but the class was canceled because dr Gordon was diagnosed with cancer and I got bumped to a MWF class.  So if anyone ever feels like praying for him...  anyway...If i don't manage that time well, i'ma be soo screwed... but i think sleeping til noon counts as a good use of time, what with the recovering energy and stuff.... And speaking of prayer... Tom's daughter-in-law's niece lives in Germany and was getting treated for Leukemia and they pronounced her completely cured of it, but the doctor said they should give her one last treatment and so they went ahead with it.  Turns out there were two chemicals for her, one admin'd through IV, and one into the spinal cord.  The system over there got the two mixed up, ended up putting the stuff into her spinal cord and completely paralyzing her... I can't remem the details exactly, but she has no movement whatsoever except her eyes or something... I know you guys really aren't the praying crowd, but please keep her in your thoughts...


On a lighter note, went to a fun party friday for Carissa, who transferred in this semester.  She went to the same HS as a bunch of my friends from Hershey PA.  Finally saw Shawshank Redemption after that, pretty sweet movie, been wanting to see it for some time... There's this one guy Pat from band (Mike's in band so i've got a bunch of band friends) and... i dunno... he's a lot bigger/stronger (300 lb mebbe?) and tends to inflict/threaten gross amounts of violence to the point of dominating whatever.  At one point after the movie he said 'why am i always the bad guy' and this other kid Matt, who's probably as self-conscious and sociallably uhhh ...weak... as they come says 'because you are' and Pat just goes off saying if you ever say that again i'll kill you... with COMPLETE SERIOUSNESS EVEN THOUGH IT WAS FUCKING OBVIOUS MATT WAS JOKING!!  The kid's nervous enough as it is and he doesn't need Pat's insecurites to make it worse!! well anyway... partied a bunch sat and sun... but I must get to chem now... so i'll talk to yous all's later"

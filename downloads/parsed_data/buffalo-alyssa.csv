"event","There are so many things that have brought up to me in the last few weeks. I finally thought I had leveled out and have calmed down in my life. Most of these thoughts have been brought out by someone who I havent seen in five years, who was a wild child but last year got called to god. And then all these men are approaching me and I felt like I finally got to the point where i was a man hater so I am not sure what to do. Of course when I become the man hater is when the men come back an of course I am horny which never helps. But i always love how everyone always comes around. Me and my good friend have the same ""problem"". We like these men, who seem nice but have something wrong yet we can't tell what it is. We chase and chase until they are completely gone. Then six months later they realize what is gone. (as a side note, super g i always wanted to know what it would be like to make out with you and I know you feel the same), But see its that always wanting the past that keeps me from the future. Unfortunatly my past always comes back. Perhaps I need to change my cell so my past cant find me, hehehe. Things just become more difficult as we get older. For instance, when i was 17 i think, i found this very attractive older man who happens to be a sargent in the us marines. When I was younger I liked him alot. Always a weak woman for those men in uniform. And now, after he has returned from south africa, we are going on a date. I am not sure what to expect. Or maybe I am expecting what I shouldn't be. I should just go with it. I mean we have talked for a half an hour on the phone (the longest i have ever talked to a man on the phone, i hate phones) but he is very flattering and sweet. I just want someone to challenge me. Socially, politically, artistically.

"event","So th movie has finally ended. There was a little to much drama for my tastes. Fuck there wasn't a day that went by that something didn't happen that was bad. Someone was always pissed at someone else for some retarded reason that effected everyones day for the negetive. But the wrap party was fun. My retarded producer couldnt even come to the bar while i was tending to ask for a beer... pussy. But his side kick called a truce with me for the even which seemed to work out fine. Anyways, that movie is done and all I have is the memories of never working with any of them ever again. 

So in to my appartment on saturday. I am so excited. Its all i can think about. I am also looking forward to what lies ahead of me, a few student films and then who knows what for the summer. Maybe I will be able to get a good job opertunity. I think some of the faculty have more faith in me after I was production designer of this film. That why I got that 750 set dresser job offer. Its scary to some extent because now I am starting to run crews instead of being on crews. Its alot of responicibility and I love it but truley i am extreamly freaked out by it. But this is what I want to do and I love it so my passion for it over comes the fear...

fuck this why Iam I talking so serious right now??? I want to get back, get drunk and get laid... alot this year. Who knows there is one hopeful contendent on the horizon."

It just seems to be chaos since the numerous people have showed up. one of the pa's/ loca manager was a fucking ass when he asked me if i had something for PAs to do and i said no he was like ""yeah thats what i thought"". wtf just cause he is lost doesnt mean he has to be an ass to me. I hope he doesnt become a fuck head like he was before he left because people where so pissed off at him. He needs to chill the fuck out. the director comes tomarrow. We'll see how much the color blind set designer claims as his own. whatever. hopefully with the producers here (the other ones) my crew will get the credit they deserve. So many people busted ass to dress that fucking set and I over heared him braging to one of the actresses today that he did the whole fucking thing. But i will have to deal with this for the rest of my carreer so might as well get used to it now. I am just sick and fucking tierd of getting blaimed for things that are not my fucking thing to deal with. whatever. I'll just recoil for a few days and only worry bout what prop crew needs to get done. As long as we have our shit done then we can take on everyone elses.

I saw my parents today. They said I looked rediciulously skinny so my dad feed me like a million things of food. He also was so excited to see me he had to show me everything he had been doing at the house. He showed me his tomato garden and told me about all the changes he was doing with the water garden. Mom just seemed tierd and worried because I looked so skinny. With her its either i am too fat or too skinny. It seems like I can never be perfect for anyone."

I have been so mad at him for so long. I feel bad because this is like the first movie he has done and he is under alot of pressure. The part I felt bad about was he said something to the effect that I might hate him at the end of the show and I might hate him now. I really dont hate him, hes my buddy he will always be my buddy cause of sitting in the office the first week with me him and another PA and no one can replace that bond from the begining. I love the man to death he has a good heart its just he seems to pick on me alot. ALOT. I think its the elementary school pull the girls hair syndrom. 

Who knows, by the end of this shoot all are relationships are going to be topsy turvy anyways. Should make a wrap party extreamly interesting. The script soup also asked me out yesterday. I am extreamly uncomfortable with him now. He kinda fallows me around and just ask me how I am. I am always like, ""i'm really busy"". Then when we went out a few days ago another person on the show tried something but I was like we have to work togeather and I dont want things to get weird but he is really sexy in a playful way. I dont have time to think about it right now. But in general, i would love to make out with someone right now except the script soup, and the first AD (who i like but not in that way), and a majority of the PAs... okay all the PAs. 

Well the producer is barking at people now and appolgized about not sleeping.

The more and more time progresses there are certain alliances being formed and some hatered brewing. One of the costume girls is pissed at me god knows why, the script soup asked me out, and the one producer enjoys more and more humiliating me for no god damn reason. But the up side of that is that one of the other producers realizes my sittuation better realize that i still do work and sticks up for me. Its helping but the second that everyone is out of the office he just yells again, threatens to fire me... of course that is empty when your not getting paid. I think he is acting more as a five year old pulling the cute girls hair. Except he attacks my work which whatever call me a slut call me a hore but dont attack my work.

This fuckin wouldnt be happening if I WASNT IN FUCKIN B-LO. anyways, i might just move in a sleep in the room with like 6 other people and share a bed with Bitte or possible find a cute guy... or pitch a tent. Dude why arent i fucking pitchin a tent in the basement with like an airmattress, at least i would be able to sleep comfortable in my natural form. So I went down stairs to talk to the producers (yes there are two now god help us, na it will really be good to take some stress off the other one) and he was like ""your going home?"" and as a joke i said ""Well i dont have anything to do."" okay i found out real quickly you dont joke about that kind of stuff. I have now lost 8 pounds over all. Which is really really cool unfortunatly its from not eating but you know. I like the first AD alot. He is very calm and very nice. I am sure that will end once production starts but like i told nick, the pa from nyc, film is like the abusive boyfriend, he beats the shit out of you (in the film sittuation though you can fight back) but in the end you still love eachother. 

Other notes, cute boy didnt come in :( but i am having weird dreams (if i lay down for quick naps) about someone else on the production... which is weird. and its not bitte or anyother girl for that matter.

I let the producer know yesterday (after much pushing to find out the truth) everything I was pissed off about. Which was alot. I talked to my mom later about it and she felt bad, she said she knew how I don't like contfrontation. But I just like went off for fourty-five minutes about everything. I think the funnest part of the conversation was when I told him how annoying it was how they spoke about woman (like if i walked around all day saying this guy has a nice ass I would be told to stop) and he was like ""well if your insecure about your apperiance here your one of the cutest girls in the house"" Hahahahaha, I laughed so hard about that. Anyways, other parts of the convo involved there indecisiveness, and there ease at pointing fingures in the wrong directions, I didnt bring up the lack of ability to drop a subject or issue... fucking cat fancy. What the fuck was I supposed to do? Also forgot the ability I dont have to read their minds. They want everything done their way but can't seem to communicate it appropreiatly ( ""just do it. I dont care, just do it"" then five minutes letter ""well why did you do it like this?"") Anyways, it wasn't the first discussion and it wont be the last. But on the upside, the hot boy was in yesterday and he was like ""You know you can call me whenever and I work to 3 and I can come in and help anytime."" My responce, ""Sure whats your number?"" AHHHH, very fun and eciting. What sucks is I wont actually be able to go on a date until after the show is wrapped... which is september??? wtf.

I just heared someone discribe a girl as cute again... curse this metropalistic office i work in. I have proble said everyday this week that I wish I was in the basement. When I get pissed I do go in the basement and do work so I dont have to listen to this every minute of every day.

I am so fucking yurning right now for something. Help me sleep better. Plus it would be a cool thing to add to my check list of weird sex stories. He so fucking gorgeous... ERGH! What I would... anyways distracted. Damn the slight case of ADHA. 

Weird story too, Dan (this guy that I knew from Six Flags when i was 15 and had an internship) came by the office yesterday. I havent seen him in like a year it was weird but I was so excited to see him. 

Kevin, the kinda art director from NYC troma, is being really nice to me. Its freaking me out. Like its almost like he is reporting to me which freaks me out more. But I dunno, I knida feel bad for him it sounds like he goes through alot of shit but I am not sure completely if he didnt deserve it.

So its hot out and I have stuff to do but am delaying it until after my meetin at 11. Yes on sunday I work. 

So I watch a creapy zombie movie last night and managaed to not have scary dreams!

Hmmm. what else.... unpdate on the boys. They are all the same from last time. Still on the same level with all of them. I refuse to even think about doing anything (like sexual wise) i have no time. Unless its a quickie in the basement then we will see. 

Ugh and the other guy I was ""seeing""/had a spring fling with is no more. It was fun while it lasted and its time to move on. I dont have time to do anything like that and plus i fear that it will hold me back in my larger goals. Alright have to go because there is nothing much more to say, I think leaveing off on the note of having a bit stress relief is a good topic to end on. There is... 3 guys I could think about taking that stress out with ... hehehehe ;)"

"event","You know how there is one person, that no matter how much you hate them, or get mad at them. Or how many times you argue with them about stupid things. No matter how much you won't call them. Or wont talk to them. Because of how they might have hurt you or how you thought they hurt you. And you swear your done with them....

you can't help but feeling bad being mad at them. you both appoligize and its like nothing ever went wrong because when you see them you think about that time you woke up before them. The sun was coming through the window lighting there face and you had no words, you were intranced and all you could do was sunggle up closer to them. And when you open your eyes again, you find them stairing at you.

it scares you. that someone can hold this much power over you. and it scares you because you dont know what the other person is thinking. and it scares you to know that they are scared too. 

but like they say, its not worth something if you didn't fight for it"

"event","Hahahah, alright at the club last night. It was fun, kinda crazy but fun. I wish I was more drunk for it. 

So I had a couple conclusions today while driving back from Lanza's, where they said my car might be out of commission for two weeks, actually it was two conclusions in particular. I was thinking bout last night and how i broke my own rule of making out/ kissing/ hooking up with the same guy in the same club twice, and i was like ""whats so wrong with that?"". That whole going crazy thing i talked bout two days ago i decided why the hell not. See this kid last night wants to get laid bad, and hey i'm pretty, so it transfers to he wants to lay me bad. Plus the last time we were out i made out with his ex girlfriend while i was really really drunk so I think he thought that was hot. Anyways, as far as this other guy who i really like, i'm done with it. I figured out today in one of my conclusions that i wont chase after him. See we had fun, it was a spring fling though. I was the rebound girl. It took me awhile to figure it out, once i realized I have meet none of his friends and no one knows about me in his life, i think thats a big sign that nothing is ever gonna happen more than sex between us. And who knows, maybe ten years down the road Ill run in to him, we'll have a drink, and have one more night of insane sex. I can be optimistic. 

Okay second conclusion, so like nobody is friends with my ex boyfriend anymore but they are all still friends with me. Not only the girlfriends but his guy friends too. Then I ran across the photo album from prom, his senior prom, and i was flipping through thinking bout how it was kinda fun except for the fact that he got a headache that night, but whatever. Then it hit me, after all is said and done i was the big and better person. Why did i let him hurt me? i never understood that but now I feel almost released of the burden that he had over me that was keeping me down. I feel very strange and good. I know my life is heading somewhere but I do feel sorry for him. He was so attached to his parents and now they are gone and he was such a mamas boy it has to be hard for him. Also, i heard from some of the guys that he has been failing classes and has lost a ton of weight, and to be honest, i am some what concerned and then comes the part of me feeling sorry for him. I mean, he was really hard worker and really smart and now he has let his life deteriorate to be the next jim smith (sorry to the none Target members who don't know what an insult that is, basically it means he will be running a Target the rest of his life). So I really do feel bad for him, he really needs a good woman to help him get his life on track. One who is really really patient.

But back to this hanging out with the boys. I had a really fun time seeing Tony and Adam again. Tony got huge! I was like... wow, tony got... more hot. ( If your reading this I am sure that is making you laugh or smile or making your day or something) And then Adam was the same. It was weird I never thought Adam liked me all that much but he was so nice on tuesday. Not that I ever thought he was mean or not a cool guy I just never thought he liked me that much. So anyways, Tony was the same, goofy and nice and sweet Tony. But it was really nice to see them and hopefully i will hang out with them more this summer. I am really proud of those boys- Parker, Adam, and Tony. Its not like they ever where screw ups or whatever but they really have re-prioritized. I believe they all had high goals but it just took them awhile to realize what needs to be done to achieve those goals and to a large extent they are still working on them. But they have really all grown up to be nice men."

"event","So I proble cause most of these problems myself. First of all my poor car. It has been bashed into, deflated, and ticketed. Second of all I am thinking weird thoughts. Well that guy I talked bout awhile ago I still like him. But he still needs his own space to figure out what he wants to do and who he wants to become. Well i can only handle so much ecspecially when I am horny we all know this so I have had some fun drunk moments. Lets just say there was an open bar at this wedding i went to and all these guys where trying to pick me up. So of course I had to go with the class structure and went after a grooms men. It was fun. Then like one of my really good friends who I love with all my heart is being to change alot and for the better. I look at him a little bit differently now, not just as this guy I know but as a man. I know it sounds so completely dubm but there is this new level of respect I have for him. Let me clarify a bit too, not only is he becomeing a man but he is becoming a good man.

So anyways, I am home for the summer working for Troma, one of the most promanent underground horror movie production agencys. They have made such movies as the Toxic Advenger. So its an unpaid internship but I am working my ass off to impress them so I can maybe get somewhere after college. 

So back to men, because they seem to be largest problem. I guess though some of the problem roots with me. my parents say i have always acted like i was older my whole life because of my family being so much older than me. So that might be a major reason for a few things, a) why i feel like i need to be in a stable relationship. everyone i know is going around getting drunk, puking, and having one night stands (hopefully not in that order or not all three at once... ew), but i look at them and im like ""been there, done that"". I have had one nighters and you dont feel alright after them you actually feel worse. But perhaps its because I want sex constantly and having that type of steady relationship would ""garrenty"" that i would get it alot. b) why i can date men my own age. I CAN'T. shuddup i know your all laughin out there right now but i have dated like a few men my own age and i cant handle it. There as horny as i was when i was 15 which is no good cause i can't keep up. or they just want to party and get drunk and make out with girls at club who are basically blow up dolls. all body but nothin upstairs. and c) i am not attracted to men in the art feild. yeah everyone thinks that artists like artists, but i dont. i am around artists all day long and cant escape. for christ sake my moms a mother, i feel like the last thing i need in my life right now is another crazy, illogically, over emotional, over dramatic artists. hahaha i love it! its like i am talkin bout myself! 

well i guess i shouldnt be too upset. cause rereading this it seems like i have alot of problems too work out myself. I always seem to be torn between work and family. I am so passonait about what I dont but I love the idea of family. WTF! I am 20 years old when did this fucking shit happen?! I want to be 17 again and in the club with my party girls getting drunk and watching Ally put her hands down Demans pants. those where the good old days. when nothin mattered. getting old sucks.

alright I have come to a conclusion about all this. my whole goal this summer beside working on my carrer is being drunki and making out with lots of random guys at clubs. i deserve that! its been a good two years since i have been able to do that! So look out you canadain boys and b-lo boys, and girls keep your boyfriends locked up because I will be on the prowel!!!"

I freak out when guys don't call me and I have had alot of that this break. So its my twentyth birthday comeing up and I thought I would be freaked out about it but I am more freaked out that in one month it will be one god damn year sence i have been laid. one year since my head has beaten up against the head board. And one year since I have been physically relaxed. Fuck this shit. See I don't thinkit even leads to that but I do want a boyfriend a good one. My last one was alright but it only lasted a few months because i was pleging shit in my head. I wasnt over analyzing i just wasnt happy. I think it wouldnt even be that bad if both my best friends are getting laid normally. Alright alright, I am just upset because I havent been doing anything for the last few weeks. I was sick the first week, then had no classes the second week, and then i am on vacation the third week. Once I get back to school and ""work"" i will be able to put so much of myself into it i wont have to worry about anything else."

"event","You know that song ""i did a bad bad thing, du du du du du du, i did a bad bad thing"" Yeah well. Anyways So sat i got drunk and made out with a freshman, and then a late late night last night I made out with a friend I have had for like two years almost and then i kinda led this other guy in my shakespeare and japan class on by whispering sweet nothings. What did I like most you ask? I liked making out with my friend. Shit I havent been kissed like that in a very very long time. like the only good kisser i remember is a guy i fooled around with who had a girl friend. fooled around = slept with. Alot. So this guy, he is a D & P student. and i have know him for a long time so its weird that there is something going on but its good. We are both the same. ex-whores. ex-slut. either or. But holy shit it was hot. We where making out all over the studio cause no one was there. God it was hot. When i left he was like ""your not coming back with me? i thought you we were going to hang out tonight?"" earlier the day he said he liked a challenge so this was my responce ""I am not one of your little one night stands. You want me you can savor me. You wanted a challenge and now you got one."" i think i did that just to hold myself back and make it better. He left today unfortunatly and i wont see him until i get back from spring break. God thats gonna be way more hotter. So here is my description, hes tall like 6'-3"" or 6'-4"", big guy proble a bit over 200 pounds, (for those who dont know that is a good weight for a guy that big) God it was so hot. It makes my toes curl just thinking bout it."

"event","so... hahaha all that stuff i had to do went down the drain when they told me monday I had the flu. So i have been hacking up a lung all week, I have had a fever so high i halucinated that Johnny Depp came out of my poster in black and white, and I have had no voice for 75% of the time. AND i couldnt go to any of my classes! It actually sucked really bad cause now I ahve to make it all up! Anyways... being sick makes ya think alot. First of all there have been some guys who have come in to my head that i would have never imagined. First of all, I hope Chad is okay. I really do because I worry about him being over seas. Second, I have actually thought about a first year. Which I would have never thought about because i dont date younger men. But i also never say never. The one thing that sucked was I did this rendered model all week and I struggled to get it done and I gave my teacher the flu! hahaah! I know I did because i was the only person to get it out of all four people in my class. The other thing that sucks about getting sick is i cant drink!!! And there is like 3 bottles of wine in my fridge!!!! AHHHHH! alright I am gonna eat some ham and lay down again."

Bush, unlike those liberal elitist types, understands the value of an education.  With penetrating insight, he explains, ""I think that part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought.  You're asking me whether or not people ought to be exposed to different ideas, the answer is yes.""  For example, some people (like archeologists) believe that the first humans to live in the Americas migrated across the landbridge from Asia, while others (like the Zuni Native American tribe) believe that they emerged from a subterranean world of spirits.  Bush recognizes that social studies teachers should give equal time to these two theories, so that students can, as he puts it, ""understand what the debate is about."""

"event","The recent Kansas schoolboard hearings have had me reading about what's now called the ""Intelligent Design"" movement.  I thought I'd write down the details I wanted to remember, and then just decided to turn it into a livejournal post.

Back in the 80s, things got started with what was then called ""creation science.""  Basically, this was a campaign for teaching the Biblical story of creation in high school biology classes.  There was some pretense of ""creation science"" being a legitimate scientific field, but it was very thinly veiled.  For example, the results of the carbon dating of fossils were explained by (I'm not kidding) increases in the rate of electron decay caused by divine intervention.  They got an equal time measure passed in Arkansas, which was overturned by the Supreme Court.  A lot of top scientists testified at the hearing, and some of the very amusing transcripts are available on the internet.  For example, Stephen Jay Gould testifies that the stratification of the fossil record cannot be explained, as the creationists maintained, by some animals being on mountaintops and other at sea level when Noah's flood hit.

I didn't read the exact language of the ruling, but the subsequent response by creationists makes the gist of it clear.  First of all, there suddenly exists a new scientific theory, ""Intelligent Design,"" which of course bears no relation to the Biblical story of creation.  No more talk of Noah's Ark--or of God, for that matter.  In fact, there don't seem to be any specific positive claims, as those have an inconvenient tendency to get disconfirmed by evidence.  There are no articles in peer-reviewed journals arguing for this new theory.  (To be fair, there are a few articles of decent quality by people sympathetic to the movement, but those articles, which have to live up to the standards of a peer review process, of course do not directly address this supposedly scientific theory.)  ""Intelligent Design"" has produced no predictions which might be held up to harsh tests, nor led to any new discoveries of any kind.  There are exactly two books on the subject by *somewhat* credentialed authors--both conservative Christians, of course.  The objectives of these books are far more limited than those of the earlier ""creation science"" books.  Both attempt only to poke holes in evolutionary theory, rather than address the overwhelming positive evidence in it's favor.  From what I understand, neither makes explicit positive claims about the origins of living things, and what each book seems to imply in this respect is grossly inconsistent with what the other does.

Lately, there is also a rekindled political interest in ensuring that public school students are exposed to the newly expanded range of scientific theories.  Of course, ""Intelligent Design"" has about as much credibility in biology departments as Holocaust denial has in history departments, but hey, what the hell, let's just  tell 16 year olds about both theories and let them sort it out.

To a major extent, the locus of both the political movement and the meager pseudo-scientific literature is a conservative think tank called the ""Discovery [sic] Institute.""  Back in 1999, an internal document was leaked from this group which described what is now called their ""Wedge Project.""  It detailed their mission to (again, not kidding) overthrow the prevailing worldview of ""scientific materialism.""  Judging by this document, these are not a bunch of Bible Belt rednecks--they are educated, organized, well-funded, and politically connected.  Their plan to overthrow ""scientific materialism""--a goal shared by many conservatives in powerful positions--is to use ""Intelligent Design"" to split open scientific materialism at what they see as its ideological core:  the theory of evolution by natural selection.  In other words, they hope to mitigate their uphill battle to overthrow the scientific worldview by getting ""Intelligent Design"" into public discourse, especially in the schools.  (They seem to also think they can win over the academy, but that's so far-fetched, I'm not at all worried.)

So what's the game plan for getting ""Intelligent Design"" into the classroom?  First, publish a few books/articles by people with scientific credentials.  Next, launch a PR campaign on behalf of the new ""scientific theory,"" consisting of book tours, newspaper Op-Ed columns, talk radio appearances, word-of-mouth in the existing church infrastructure, and endorsements by ""influential opinion-makers.""  Their hope is that by successfully introducing ""Intelligent Design"" into the public discourse by a PR campaign, they will force eminent scientists to engage with it in public forums, essentially legitimating it.  (You don't see eminent historians debating holocaust denial on TV.)

This was a five year plan for 1999-2003, and much of it has come true.  They got their token books published, although nothing in peer-reviewed journals.  I don't know many details about their PR campaign, but here's one example I'm aware of:  They recently made a $16,000 ""donation"" to the Smithsonian in exchange for showing anti-Darwinian films in the museum.  They were also heavily involved in the Kansas hearings, and I get the impression that there's a lot more on the way.  (Given the strategy of this group, I now understand why the scientific community boycotted the Kansas hearings--they don't want to legitimate ""Intelligent Design"" by engaging with it publicly.)

I am worried not only by the goals of this group, but by their motives and methods.  Concerning their motives:  While the tone of the Wedge Document makes it clear that these people genuinely doubt ""scientific materialism,"" their main concern seems to be with what they see as its negative *social* consequences.  In other words, their overriding aim in challenging current scientific research is to change the shape of our culture.  They are of course not alone among conservative elites in this attitude towards education, and that is a frightening thing for those of us who'd prefer a nation of educated, rather than indoctrinated, citizens.  Concerning their methods:  It's no surprise, then, that the intellectual integrity of this group is very low.  To be sure, they see themselves as fighting for one big Truth, but all the little truths along the way don't seem to concern them much.  Their documented strategy is to circumvent the intellectual standards of the scientific community by going straight to the general public with an (oftentimes highly deceptive) PR campaign, forcing scientists to respond by engaging ""Intelligent Design"" as they would a legitimate scientific theory.  Just imagine the consequences of more widespread use of such tactics by outside organizations seeking to shape the course of scholarly research."

"event","I'm watching the British version of The Office, and Ricky Gervais' character just told a joke which horrified his employees. To someone jokingly questioning his sexual orientation, Gervais' character responded, ""I'm not gay. I've never even come over a little queer."" After saying this, he made a vigorous ""jerk off"" motion with his right hand.

Since the show is produced for a British audience (i.e., an audience whose members are notoriously obsessive about social mores), the viewer is intended to find humor in the awkwardness following crude behavior in a professional setting. But like any red-blooded American, I just like a good dirty joke.

Because of the context in which it is uttered, one interprets the joke's second sentence as saying of its speaker that he has never been perceived as homosexual. Under this way of parsing the sentence syntactically, ""come over"" is a single transitive verb phrase, ""a little"" is an adverb phrase meaning ""slightly,"" and ""queer"" an adjective. Then, the jerk off motion. Suddenly, words are replaced by their homonyms, changing the underlying grammatical structure of the sentence. ""Come"" is interpreted as the slang intransitive verb meaning ""ejaculate,"" ""over"" as a preposition, ""a"" the indefinite article, ""little"" an adjective, and ""queer"" a noun. The sentence, so reinterpreted, now describes a comical image: its speaker ejaculating onto a small gay man.

Hilarious."

"event","I just got back from dinner with another grad student and Ned Block, Tom Nagel, and Paul Churchland.

Tom Nagel looks the part of a distinguished scholar:  an impeccable suit, silver hair swooped back, bushy eyebrows swooped back, a positively regal voice.  Ned has somehow come up with a style which combines sleek New York intellectual with wacky scientist.  As for Churchland, i could imagine him hunting big game in the savannas of Kenya with a local guide named ""Matunde"".  (It means ""fruits"".)

Ned and Curchland argued for a while about empirical work in cognitive science.  Every once in a while, Tom would introject with a comment like ""I don't know how you can be philosophers and love information so much.  I became a philosopher because I hate information.""

Later, Ned and Tom talked about the FBI files they accumulated during their lefty college years.  And Ned told us about how he got a presidential deferment from the draft by convincing them that he was insane.  Without any knowledge of specific mental diseases, he apparently just wrote them a letter in which he ""tried to sound crazy."""

"event","My heart is week
My soul has lifted
The crackle of the milting ice that once surrounded me is all that I hear
Yet my heart remains dormant
In the depth of my soul only you may see
The true form of me
I repulse myself for being so week
 
If only for you...
If only for a time...
 
If life were to end now what would it be?
 
A wondering soul never finding the answer
To the only question she may ever dare to ask
A question that may even define
Her fait
Her future
Dare I say... even her past?
 
My love is my downfall
Oh the fait of so many men
Shell this too be mine?
 
To see my end all because of a question
All for an insignificant answer!
 
No I dare not say
For my weakness overtakes me again
 
Shall the shadows of my once free heart came back to hunt me?
 
Though my fears are great
and my loss may even be greater
 
I give myself to you
Do as you wish
For no more damage could possibly be done to this insignificant soul
So much torment
So much pain
All for what?
For a lost answer always to remain an empty question
 
Answer me..."

"event","this is some of the crap that fills my mind, it means nothing and will always remain  mine

You and I
there is a new life ahead
were angels of light watch upon us
My sanctuary
were years of lies melt away
what's left of me
My life is a lie
and you
you are true
The magical times
Shared long ago
it seems as only yesterday
I watch you sleep
But i hear nothing
Tears of the past washed away
My fears..
My lies..
Washed away..
The last cry of hope reached out of you and I grabbed a hold
you pulled me in
engulfed me whole
Killing the last bit of sanity in me
Releasing what was hidden
what should have never been let go of
You released...
 
Me
 
my tears my lies
the past washed away
 
For you and I
we have a new life ahead
to started anew
with angels of light watching upon us"

"event","Here is some of my poetry. It's not very good but this is one that I wrote a long time ago.

Life

I have more knowledge now
then when I was young
Learning the ways of life, 
Up and Down
a never ending spiral of events.
Life and Death, 
you can not have one without the other
Life is such a precious thing,
to hold a new life in your arms
to see it's tiny smile. And yet to have it taken away
so easily...
as if it were a delicate flower petal floating away.
Try to catch it you may, but in the end
it is as pointless as chasing after the wind.
Years long stolen from me never to return
I have felt happiness, sadness, shame, pity, and remorse
I know that when my flower petal flows away.
there will be a tiny smile to replace it.
Now my life is complete

By Jai

That is one of my poems. It isn't really good but at the time it was the way I felt. A close friend of mind had died.

This is the poem that I sent in a contest and it made it to the finalist!!

Once a life ago

A life ago
Such a long time 
Sitting on your front porch 
Staring at the sky
Listening to your stories
Playing in the mud
Learning about the past
Living the present 
But never truly thinking of the future
A care fre little girl...

Is that how they will remember me?

As that young little tomboy
Running with her friends
With no watch around her wrist 
Only the sun to tell her when the day ends
A life ago it seems
As if it were a dream...


This is one of my favorites. How do you like it?"

INGREDIENTS:

4 eggs
3 tbsp dashi soup stock
2 tsp sugar
2 tsp soy sauce
1/5 cup chopped green onion

PREPARATION:

Beat eggs in a bowl. Add soy sauce, sugar, dashi, and green onion in the bowl and mix well. Heat little bit of vegetable oil in a square omelette pan on mid heat. Pour a scoop of egg mixture in the pan and spread over the surface. Roll the egg and move it the end of the top side. Oil the empty part of the pan and pour more egg mixture in the space and under the rolled egg. Cook it until half done and roll the egg again so that the omelette becomes thicker. Repeat this process until the egg mixture is gone.<li>When omelette is done, remove it from the pan and put on a bamboo mat. Using the mat, shape the omelette. Cut into 1-inch pieces. 
Makes 4 servings"

I miss winter already!! <=> I miss snowboarding and skiing, sitting by the fire with friends, and running in the snow until I fall on my face. WWAAWWAAA WHY DID WINTER LEAVE ME!!!!

I'm just joking. But I do miss winter. Summer here is just too hot and there is too many bees. I HATE bees!!! But know I have to get back into shape and go swimming. Hopefully I will go to Japan this year. I study really hard now, with my Japanese and Korean. My friend Mat is helping me with my Korean. He is so cute! ^-^

I'm still at work but calls are coming in slow. I even have to work on Saturday!!! That sucks. But Hey next weekend is my friends party so I have to buy her something that will be fun. 

I'm still so tired."

Then at the begainning of next month I will buy britts present! I really wish they had sent out the invites sooner then I won't be so rushed!! I only have $10 to get me through the week but that is partly my falt because I woke up late today and didn't have time to make lunch so I had to order out today. I really want to get Britt something nice. But I don't even like the girl Nelson is marring, So I'm just getting him something.

"event","Japanese Writing System  

Besides the three forms of writing (kanji, hiragana, katakana), Japanese is sometimes written in Romaji. Romaji is primarily used for the convenience of foreigners. With Romaji, one can read Japanese without knowing any Japanese writing system. Although there are several systems of Romaji, the most widely used is a modified Hepburn system.  

All three types of Japanese characters are designed to be written in vertical lines, from right to left, but they can be written horizontally as well. Years ago, almost all Japanese writing was vertical, but the horizontal style has slowly become more popular since it is easier to include Arabic numerals and passages from other foreign languages. However most newspapers still retain the vertical style."

Japanese nouns have no gender and number. <br />2. Verb conjugation is not affected by the gender or number. <br />3. Japanese verbs have only two tenses: the present and the past. <br /><br />The Japanese writing system is totally different from English, because it does not use an alphabet. It may be the most difficult part of Japanese to learn, but I think it is also fun and interesting. There are three different types of writing scripts in Japanese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Kanji <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hiragana <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katakana</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />One writes Japanese using a combination of all three. <br /></p>"

Well any why I know a lot of Japanese but I'm going to start at the beginning level. Here is the first lesson: <br /><br />Japanese Pronunciation <br /><br />The Japanese language has only 5 vowels: A, I, U, E, O. They are terse vowels, pronounced clearly and sharply. If one pronounces the vowels in the following sentence one will have their approximate sounds. Please note: the ""U"" is pronounced with no forward movement of the lips. <br /><br /><u>A</u>h (a), w<u>e</u> (i) s<u>oo</u>n (u) g<u>e</u>t (e) <u>o</u>ld (o). <br /><br />Oh and by the way I get most of these lessons from http://japanese.about.com/blintroductory.htm"

My soul has lifted
The crackle of the milting ice that once surrounded me is all that I hear
Yet my heart remains dormant
In the depth of my soul only you may see
The true form of me
I repulse myself for being so week
 
If only for you...
If only for a time...
 
If life were to end now what would it be?
 
A wondering soul never finding the answer
To the only question she may ever dare to ask
A question that may even define 
Her fait
Her future 
Dare I say... even her past?
 
My love is my downfall
Oh the fait of so many men 
Shell this too be mine?
 
To see my end all because of a question
All for an insignificant answer!
 
No I dare not say
For my weakness overtakes me again
 
Shall the shadows of my once free heart came back to hunt me?
 
Though my fears are great
and my loss may even be greater
 
I give myself to you
Do as you wish 
For no more damage could possibly be done to this insignificant soul
So much torment 
So much pain 
All for what?
For a lost answer always to remain an empty question

Then I called back again to see if she was okay and she hung up on me again! Now I know that I did play a jock on her a while ago but she said she was over it! I pretended to be someone else on the internet to see how close she would get to a stranger on the internet. I told her before that I was worried because she gets soo close to people that she dosen't know online and a girl I know a long time ago what killed by a person she met online. So naturally I was worried about her! So I wanted to see how close she would go with a person online. She went very far! But then I told her that it was me! And that I was sorry that I lied to her but I was scared that she would get hart! She said that she was over it and was okay but now she is acting all mean and saying that she hates me!!

I was just inviting her over to say with me while her parents are on vacation. I even worked overtime so I could take her to a cool sushi place and now out of no where she goes off on me. I asked her why but she wouldn't answer me!! What do I do??"

Miso soup is always made by combining hot dashi with your choice of miso paste. In Japan miso soup is not just eaten at dinnertime, many people have as the first meal of the day a cup full of hot miso soup! All you need to prepare this healthy and delicious treat is a small sieve 
and a pot. 

INGREDIENTS
3 cups dashi (see basics for preparation method)
1/4 cup miso (either red or white miso)


CONDIMENTS
1 teaspoon of wakame seaweed, chopped fine (optional)
1 slice of tofu an inch long and half an inch wide, finely diced into cubes
2 teaspoons of very finely chopped green onions 
Put the dashi in a saucepan or small pot and bring to a near boil. Place the miso into a small hand held sieve, dip it into the dashi in order to moisten, and then with a spoon, stir and push the miso through the sieve. Continue dipping and stirring until all the miso is dissolved into the dashi. Add the tofu and allow to simmer. Serve the soup into a lacquer bowl and garnish with the chopped onions."

"event","I found this totally hot recipe for Kimchi. nothing special but it's really good!

Ingredients: 2 large cabbages used in making Kimchi (buy the firmer cabbages, which can be almost 5 pounds in weight each), 
rock salt 1/3 of a cup, 2 cups of water. 
Regular salt 3Tbs 
Ground red pepper 2/3 of a Cup (must be a Korean brand), 
grounded Asian pears 1/2 of a cup, grounded onions 1/2 of a cup. 
6 Tbs of finely chopped garlic, 
1 Tbs of finely chopped ginger, 
Salt 2-3 Tbs, Sugar 1tsp, 
eck jut (loosely translated - fish juice, available in Korean grocery stores) 1/2 of a Cup, 
white radish (chopped into thin horizontal strands, about 6 inches in length) 2 cups, 
green onions (4cm in length) 1 Cup, 
 
Preparations: Add the rock salt to the water from part A and add the cabbages. On warm weather (at least 15 degrees Celsius) let it sit for 6 hours, on colder days (anything less than 10 degrees) let it sit for at least 8 hours. 


Separately mix the ingredients from part C. Then add in the ingredients from part D and mix well. 


Take the salted cabbages and set it on a large strainer so it drips excess water (let it sit for about 30 minutes). Add a little bit of salt in between the cabbage leaves. 


Then add the mixture from part C and D by liberally placing it in between each of the cabbage leaves. Take the outermost leaf of the cabbage and wrap it around the entire cabbage, making a neat little packages. After you have added all the mixture to the cabbages, place it in tupperware or a large jar and place it in a cool place. 


If you want it to ferment longer, let it sit out. But if you prefer the taste of just made kimchi, leave it in the refrigerator. When you're ready to eat it, cut it into slices."

"event","dear livejournal, 
 
long time no see.  i'm just gonna dive right in. 

this week has been an eventful one.  the great-looking man with an awful attitude that i've been dating for the past three months finally initiated a conversation that quickly lead to a mutual, friendly breakup.  after we talked, we just hugged and hugged and that was the nicest we've been to one another for a few weeks.  while we were breaking up, jeff put on a phillip glass album, which included a beautiful song that i had listened to on repeat during my break up with eric.  synchronicity, you will never fail to amaze me.  

i moved!  my new house has a composting toilet.   being a squeamish-type, i am having a difficult time adjusting (meaning, i hold it).  the boys (meaning, boys) that lived there before me are sweethearts, but slobs, so i've spent a lot of time cleaning up the house and getting it ""lady-dized.""  i keep saying that word to myself as i scrub the shower, paint the walls, collect empty whiskey bottles... ""gotta git dis place lady-dized!!  yes-yes!""

my little sister came to visit me.   friends told us we act like we're from the south, like we're SOUTHERN BELLES.  it is a compliment, but it's also puzzling, because i feel like we're both kinda grubby and goofy, we sit with our legs sprawled all over and we say words like ""fucken"" and ""asshole.""  anyhow.  we cooked together and sat on a log by the water, watching waterbirds and boats.  we put on essential oils (marla prefers cedar right now, and fennel is my favorite) and did egyhop (the emma goldman youth and homeless outreach program).  it was good times.  

my backpack got stolen.  i have to replace my i.d., my bank card, my cell phone, all the numbers that were on my cell phone, a whole stack of cds, etc etc.  i have already replaced the backpack and a wallet, both purchased last night at the goodwill for a DOLLAR EACH.  easy come, easy go.  

bonny ""prince"" billy and juana molina are both playing shows soon.  they are both on my ultimate all time favorite list,  and i want to be there to see them each, but i am broke!  then again, i don't want finances to keep me from living my life!   but really, i need to pay rent!  circles and loops and little tiny infinities go around in my head all day long.  i wish i were the kind of person who knew how to be DECISIVE!  and CERTAIN!  and ACTION-ORIENTED!  me, i'll just think about things and let them stew for ever until the opportunity has passed and all that consideration becomes a waste of time.  and i drive myself crazy doing it... but this, but that, but this...

anyhow, livejournal, i've missed you.  it's time for me to head out into the chilly saturday night..."

"event","today olympia feels and looks like my beloved flagstaff.  it is snowy and sunny.  it has been for quite awhile now, thank the sweet lord, and the break from all the rain and grey has inspired me to go on long meandering walks that get me contentedly lost.  and, oh what joy, i have been able to ride my bike around.  i have become car dependent, just as i feared i would.  i found myself going off on my usual ""what the fuck is the point of putting anti-war or environmental bumper stickers on a gas-guzzling, carbon-producing car?"" rant, but this time i was driving while i was ranting.  it only occurred to me what a hypocrite it made me several blocks down the road.  a few days ago, my car done broke down and will cost hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars to fix.  i think  was the universe helping me to get back on rylie's happy track.  the car was bad for me financially, morally and physically (i have gained about 15 pounds since leaving flagstaff, most of which i attribute to anxiety-driven compulsive eating, but the car certainly hasn't helped).    it's easy to be excited about being a biker/pedestrian again, but when the weather gets rainy again, i'm sure i'll be complaining like a wee baby crashing off of a sugar high.  

still no job.  i'm really freaking out about it but i won't talk about it here because i'm trying to relax!

hilary and i have settled into the house and it's becoming more comfortable by the day.  she is a very talented artist, so our walls are covered in a mix of her prints and my random collection of weird art.  our living room is warmed by the fireplace, lit by huge windows in the daytime and chinese lanterns at night.  we live off of our version of papusas, beans and cheese melted between corn tortillas.  we have this wonderful philosophical energy bouncing around.  we are studying order vs. chaos, a strange culmination of many things, mostly my current interest in buddhism and her interest in fractal math.  i practice walking meditation and she is producing wonderful art.  it's exciting and wonderful to be able to share ideas with her.  

i met a boy who i was starting to like quite a bit, but he never calls me back so, again, it must be the universe giving me a hint that it wasn't meant to be.  that's a hippy way of saying the dude is lame and i'm waiting for something better to come along.  it is disappointing, though.  so far both of the people that i have met and befriended on my own have crapped out.  it's HARD for me to meet people, so it sucks that i can't seem to keep them around.  

i'm terribly homesick."

"event","welly, i made it.  years of talkin' and whinin' and dreamin' about it, i'm finally sittin' in a coffee shop sippin' on a latte in muthafuckin' olympia washington.  it feels just like flagstaff to me, which is nice because i love flagstaff.  my friend hilary and i found a beautiful old house to live in.  i'm really excited about it.  it has an old piano it it, and a fireplace and the livingroom windows look out over budd bay and the interstate.  kool.  

i need a job.  i've applied all over the place, but no callbacks.  i need some friends.  we went out to bars and a party the other night but i didn't meet anyone i think i could become friends with.  i need to go to evergreen university.  they have a program where you learn how to sail.  oh baby.  i need to make out with beautiful olympia people.  they are everywhere, and they're on bikes.  

i'm getting more and more homesick everyday, but i'm also getting more excited to be here as i explore and get comfortable with the place.  it's going to be good.  you can only see it on clear days, but mt. rainier is like twenty san fransisco peaks all stacked up.  i got goosebumps the first time i saw it.  breathtaking."

"event","when i am so depressed that i resort to reading self-help books, because it's either the books or waiting on the train tracks to smashed up to bits, i re-read the part that says how important self dialog is.   other people can compliment me, but it doesn't matter because i have absolutely nothing kind to say about myself.  i could list off all the terrible things that run through my head every day, but it would just make me sound really creepy so i won't.  anyway.  the books suggest forcing yourself to say nice things out loud, even if you don't believe it.  you have to look at yourself in the mirror right in the eye and say things like ""you are a good person""  or ""you are worthy of love"" or ""your have value in this world.""  if you say it enough times, it maybe doesn't sound like an out-right lie.  after you reach that point, keep saying it and it starts to sound almost plausible.  after that, you might even begin to feel it's the absolute, constant and infinite truth.  i'm at the stage where i can almost look myself in the eye without crying.  

related but much different:  i have realized i depend on other people, specifically people that i'm in romantic relationships with, to supply me with self-esteem.  once the thrill of a new love has started to wear off, the relationship feels shallow and superficial because after a certain point relationships need to evolve into something a little deeper than sexual attraction and it's at that point that all of my relationships have failed.  the thrill part makes me feel beautiful, interesting, desirable... for a few weeks, or months... when i realize that actually, i DON'T think i'm beautiful, i DON'T think i'm interesting, i DON'T think i'm anything like that, well, what's the point of being in a relationship?  what do i have to offer?  i'm boycotting ""dating"" and all that junk for awhile, until i'm at the point where if someone says i'm beautiful i respond with ""yeah, i know!"" or if someone says they love me, i can shout at top volume ""I LOVE ME, TOO!""  

so besides hating my life and myself, i also hate: 
--my cat.  i'm giving her to the purina factory when i move (which is in one month!).
--my job.  i quit one and i can't wait to quit the other one.
--how my parents have no faith in me.
--cars.  i have to breathe in their nasty fumes when i ride my bike, trying to do a good thing.  trying to be a goddamn good citizen.  not to mention they almost run me down all the time.
--shitty friends.  being one and having them.
--knowing i will work my fingers to the bone until the day i die and will always be living in poverty.  having a portion of my hard-earned money go to support the war (TWO BILLION DOLLARS IS SPENT ON THE AMERICAN WAR MACHINE EVERY SINGLE WEEK.  oh my fucking god.).  being a cog in the wheel.  feeling hopeless to change my position.  knowing the majority of the world's population feels this way.
--how males spread hpv (and other stds) around like it's no big deal while my friend gets to go have a surgery so she doesn't die because some dumb dickhead gave it to her.
--bug bites
--fake smiles.  maybe more than anything else, i hate fake smiles. 

that's it for the happyryliesunshinehour.  it's really not as bad as i make it out to be, or maybe it is but that's okay too."

"event","so.  i have had two baking jobs for a few months now, and even though i LOVE baking, doing two jobs that are so similar is making me nuts.  i feel like a robot.  like the oven is one machine, the mixer is a machine and i'm just another machine.  just nuts and bolts and a little electricity that can automatically make you whatever pastry you desire.  it's really bizarre.   all my hard work is going to pay off soon, though.  i'm treating myself to a trip to san fransisco at the end of the month, and then at the end of august i think i'm going to drive to olympia with my friend who's moving there.  if i love it as much as i think i will, i can probably afford to move there a month or two later.  i feel really optimistic and excited about what i'm doing with my life. 

the other day i was reading mary sojourner.  she writes about flagstaff and northern arizona in such a way that makes my heart ache.  i will miss this beautiful place... i will miss my coffeeshop, and the painted desert.  i will miss sedona and my neighborhood.  i will miss having my best friend and family so close by.  but i'm going to thrive in the pacific northwest, i can feel it.

the other day a friend and i decided we wanted a picnic.  we made food, stopped to fill ourselves with coffee and then biked out to buffalo park.  on the way is about a mile incline, and on that uphill mile the sky decided to open up and cold heavy rain poured down on us.  the rain gods decided that wasn't quite enough so they threw in some fairly good-sized hail as well.  we got to the park completly drenched and found shelter.  we ate our vegan feast and watched the clouds move past and as soon as it was clear we rode back to town.  bertoni, my sweet ride, LOVES going downhill.  i coasted along and watched the little stream that was rushing in the gutter beside me and in that moment, 
the stream and bertoni and sunlight and the magestic all connected with me.  for that moment, we were one and i didn't feel alone.  there were deer in the trees around me, and ravens circling in the grey sky and my darling friend coasting behind me... but that isn't what made me feel un-alone.  it was one of those rare hightened awareness deals. magic!!!

this darling friend of mine loves my body and cares about it and takes care of it... but he doesn't know (or seem to care to know) any other part of me at all.  usually this would not be okay with me.  but something about the timing being right and this friend of mine not fitting all the things i want from a partner but still being a good person does make it okay.  for now. 

i'm going home now and i'm going to finish folding laundry and doing dishes and i'm going to make myself some tea and maybe a salad and then i'm going to listen to records until i fall asleep or hillary calls me to go out, either one."

a new gentleman has been escorting me through my early-summer late-night wanderings and i really really like him.  i said to myself ""SELF!  take some time!  be alone (but secure and comfortable in that alone-ness), be real nice to yourself and do some soul-searching for awhile!  self-love is good love!""  but then he had to be all KIND AND CHARMING AND INTERESTED IN ME so what could i do?  we're both cautious and shy so at least we're not rushing into anything that i can't handle... 

i can't get a certain image out of my head.  it's a bunch of fish sleeping, snuggled down In sleeping bags on the dark murky bottom of a lake.  it's HILARIOUS to me and makes me smile tons.  because, don't you know, fish don't really sleep.  they never close their eyes.  isn't that MIND BOGGLING?!?  

this year marks the eighth anniversary for me and my vegetarianism.  we're good old pals by now and i'm going to celebrate it by speeding on home, making myself some eggplant punjab and then collapsing into bed and sleeping and sleeping and sleeping... like a snuggled in fish...

"event","my eyeballs have had a hard day.  i read all morning and i'm goin' blind so that hurt.  then at work a puff of steam blasted my left eye.  on the way home, i got whammied by snail (snow-hail!  ouch!) and i just cut an onion up and i'm ever so sensitive to onion fumes.  i'd cry about it, but it would just hurt my eyes more.

i'm mentally composing a dating manifesta for myself.  so far the main points are that future partners must have 1) fantasticness 2) feminist values  3)healthy drinking habits .  i'm not going to date anyone anymore unless they are amazing individuals full of vim and vigor.  i can't decide to date someone, give up so much time and energy and love to someone just because they're nice.  most everyone i know is nice.  the feminist values part was suggested by my brilliant sister.  basically my entire world view is shaped by my ideas on gender and feminist politics.   if i'm dating someone who isn't overtly feminist, we probably won't be able to understand each other past a certain point or agree on how to run our relationship.  the drinking part is obvious.  shit ain't good for rylies to be around.  i've dated lovely beautiful people, but they have been alcoholics and/or pro-lifers and/or unfaithful.  this manifesta will hopefully help me to avoid some unsavory traits from here on out.  i feel good about this.  i'm holding out for that teenage feeling.

i love her.  i wish she loved me back."

"event","i just started reading hothead paisan, the homicidal lesbian terrorist.  i identify with this character more than pretty much any other character i've ever encountered.  she hangs out in her apartment all day drinking coffee, talking to her cat and being outraged with the shitty system we're all livin'. i'm not necessarily a lesbian, and i've never cut off a man's penis and thrown it in the garbage disposal, but still.  hothead and i are like peas and carrots.  in her ideal world, you don't lock your door or your bike.  everyone says hi to each other as they walk hand in hand with their best friends down the street.  gender is totally irrelevant and her cat is the goddamn president.  yes!  yes indeed-ee-doo!

i hate locking my bike up, and i hate locking my door.  it's this constant thing you have to do everyday that reminds you ""you are not safe, others are not to be trusted, horde your things and while your at it, horde your ideas and heart and authentic self too.""  i do not want to be cut off from my surroundings.  more than anything i want connection and reciprocity.  lately, however, i'm really getting more and more terrified of leaving my bedroom.  i don't want friends or loves or any other relationship where i'm vulnerable enough for someone to take a part of me away.  i keep getting hurt.  i don't want to keep having these heart breaks.  but i don't want to be hard and distant, either.   how confusing.  but like everything else, it's about finding a balance.  i guess i have to allow myself to be shut off right now and do a bit of healing before i can brave the world once more and share and experience and live.  let maude be my guide.  EL!  EYE!  VEE!  EE!  LIVE! 

thing is, i have never really found a space where i feel safe enough to express myself.  that's perhaps why i feel this pull towards olympia.  it's a clean slate, no expectations.  the trick is to start recognizing my patterns now, and analyzing them and breaking them so that when i get to this new clear city, i don't just fall into the same mindset that i'm in here.  

i wish therapy was free and accessible because i could really use some help with this."

shivering even though i'm wearing a sweater and mucklucks and running little cirlces in front of the heater .  

caffeinated even though it's past my bedtime.  coffee is warm.  if you put sugar in it, it is sweet.  sweet warm things are good to have.  

thinking of the henry miller museum in big sur.  my then-boyfriend and i stopped there on the fourth of july a few years ago.  he went in the the tiny little house-turned-museum but i boycotted because i don't like how henry miller treated women.  i sat in the sculpture garden instead and drank bad free coffee that a nice old hippy offered me.  after awhile michael and i went out back and found an enormous redwood log to climb on together in giddy quiet.  green filtered sunlight.  thick salty air.  dinosaur ferns and plops of dew falling from the branches far far above us.  we write letters to each other now.   i'm anais and he's henry. 

compulsively cleaning my house.  fuckin' sanitized and sparkling.  except my room.  i must be subconsciously building a nest because there are newspapers and clothes and blankets strewn all across my floor and i just sort of sit on it and walk on it instead of putting anything away.  now that i think about it, i've been bringing home twigs and dried flowers a lot lately.  whoa whoa WHOA.  i'm a bird forced to live a lady's life.  suddenly everything makes sense.  ornothology n'shit.  

considering what to do with the rest of my morning.  sleep is good.  staying up and going to get chilequiles as soon as they open is better.  staying up and going to get chilequiles with red sauce, not green, and lots of hot coffee is best."

<li><b> bikes</b>:<br>one of my bikes just got stolen.  i'm bummed, for reasons twofold:  first, there was a lot of emotional history wrapped up in that bike.  my dad gave it to me when i moved to flag.  secondly, i left it unlocked because i thought it would be safe and  now a little bit of the trust i had for the people in my community is vanished off in stealy-land.   shit man, it was a sweet ride. </li><li><b> crushes</b>:<br>i've got one.  on a boy.  we're an odd couple for sure, but he's undeniably cute and kind to me and he makes me laugh.  he pulls the covers up around my ears and kisses me on the temple when he leaves in the morning.  swoon-a-rama.  swoon-o-rama ding dang.  </li><li><b> found objects</b>:<br>last week i was walking on the urban trail and i found these papers someone had dropped.  it was information a doctor had written out for someone named daniel about how to take care of his broken leg.  i wondered to myself ""what was broken-legged daniel doing walking around out here?""</li><li><b> lists</b>:<br>why do i like lists?
1. best organizational tool known to humankind, hands down.  
2. i can't remember things too good, so writting stuff down helps me.  
2.  it's genetic.  my mother, and her mother before her, were list-makers.  it's good to carry on my family heritage, i feel.
3.  they are fun to find years later.  just today i found an old to-do list that included vacuuming my room and losing five pounds.  side note:  FUCK LOSING FIVE POUNDS. </li><li><b> my cats</b>:<br>the star of the show these days is milo, my roomie's cat.  he's a biter.  he's naughty.  he likes to sleep under the covers with me.  he likes to watch drippy faucets and the toilet.  he's got love handles.  shout outs to little mister fluffers, penini, bug, boji, zuuzuu and mr. man. </li><li><b> peace and quiet</b>:<br>i don't really get enough of it lately... makes me grumpy.</li><li><b> rock and roll</b>:<br>i really like devendra banhart's new album.   i am totally in love with will oldham.  and last night, i was amazed by mr. calvin johnson.   his voice can fill a building without even trying.  </li><li><b> stargazing</b>:<br>have you ever stargazed in a mountain town in the wintertime?  give it a try, it'll send the shivvers right on up your spine.</li><li><b> tele-evangelism</b>:<br>i don't really watch tv much these days, but i used to love it.  benny hinn, the weird lady with the wobbly voice in a fake living room, and of course mr. and mrs.  crazy (the man with ugly-silk-shirt-covered man breasts and the lady with the wigs and eye lashes and fake breasts and also with the craziness.  craziness.)</li><li><b> vegetarianism</b>:<br>seven years and going strong.  i did try some spicy tuna sushi awhile ago, but i'd rather have baked tofu or hummus any day.  or avocado sandwiches or cereal with bananas sliced on top, or vegan molasses cookies or tomato soup with fresh basil or yams or refried beans.</li>

what's up with women not hangin' together?  wouldn't it be awesome if we all gave each other neck rubs when we were stressing, and brought each other tea when we were bleedin' and left secret surprises on each other's doorsteps?  wouldn't we all be stronger?  instead, we judge each other on the most unimportant things imaginable and talk shit and outcast one another from our little circles.  it sucks.  i want that to change in my life.


for my sociology class, i can write my paper on any subject that has anything to do with gender.  here are some of my ideas:
--alternatives to the gender binary
--body image issues and the differences between those of men and women
--female criminality
--anti-feminism

i'm having a hard time deciding because there's just so much to choose from and it's all amazingly interesting to me, so i need your help!   tell me which you think is the best, or give me more ideas.

even though i am really quite happpy in my little life right now, i'm thinking i should move to olympia.  maybe as soon as january.  i don't know anyone there.  i have never visited.  the whole idea came about because i want to attend evergreen university, but i doubt i could ever afford it.  so why go, when i have a home here, friends and familiar faces on the street, a sweetheart and my cats and a kick-ass job?  i don't know!  but i still think i should go!  i'm kinda dumb i think!  i like exclamation points!

on october 8th, a band called clap your hands and say yeah is playing somewhere in the metropolitan phoenix area.  i'm hoping to come down and see them, and they are awesomegood so maybe i'll see some of you there.  love to all, all, all of ya."

next summer i'm going to live in a commune.  i have wanted to experience life on a commune for as long as i remember and so i'm going to motherfuckin do it.  i also want to move to olympia and go to evergreen.  i want to live in nyc or some other metropolis for a stint.  i want to travel an ocean on a small boat.  i want to learn to be a farmer.  i want to work at a women's shelter.  i want to be a kindergarten teacher.  i want to go to india and afghanistan and morocco and kenya and argentina.  i'd like to learn how to play five instruments and cook thai food and speak spanish fluently.  i want to get really good grades in school from now on.  i got a b in math.  that is really good for me.  i want to see change and be part of any kind of revolution, big or small, personal or societal.  i want to see the good that exists.  i want to get a tattoo.

the other day, i was thinking about what my future children will be like.  i already love them more than anything else.  they will be like me but better in every way.  the girls will have messy hair and the boys will have long eye lashes and they will all have a passion for soccer.  my mom will help me look after them.  we will all live together in a big farm house in colorado or new mexico.  i'll bake bread and make ceramic sculptures and there will always be coffee brewing and people moving and music playing.  you are invited!  

i'm having a hard time concentrating on the present.  my mind is always wandering into the future.  there is so much that i would love to do in my life."

"event","flagstaff had it's first monsson storm of the season this afternoon.  it was CRRRAAAZZZY.  the wind was blowing rain in my front windows and the bedroom window on the opposite side of the building at the same time.   the cats refuse to come in the apartment anymore because it smells like the kittens jen and i were watching for a few weeks so little and pen were out there and the plants got flooded and it was all amazing.  and welsome, and a relief.  everyone has been waiting for the storms to come, to break the heatwave and replenish our rivers and rios and fake lakes. i love the summer here.

i think i might be sick but i'm too scared to go to a doctor to find out about it.  i know that's dumb, but i can't help it.  i love my body right now probably more than i ever have.  i don't want to hear that i'm not going to have the freedom of movement that i have been cherishing lately.   really.  the simplest of pleasures are what keep me sane.  sun on skin.  stretching muscles.  hugs.   air in lungs.  

this summer has been great.  there has been a shift in my attitude, i am not content just to work anymore.  between the classes i've been taking and working at the coffeehouse, i've been really busy.  i've been getting only 6-ish hours of sleep a day, and balancing that out with a lot of coffee.  it's a magical combination.  it's been a long time since i've felt this happy and healthy and able and strong.  i don't have time to sit around feeling lousy.  i'm around people all day.  it's wonderful.  i make cakes for a living.  c'mon.

4) 5 books that mean a lot to me?
---catcher in the rye-it was my first ""adult"" book and i didn't quite understand all of it, but i still knew it was something i related to.
===the sterile cuckoo-i laughed, i cried, i envisioned my first romance.

i feel homeless.  and at the moment, quite alone and out-cast.  of course, it's all in my head but what isn't.  

that's one of the great things about this fella i'm with now.  being in his presence brings my consciousness out of my own head, and into the bigger reality around me.  it is so beautiful out here... no constant hatred pointed in my direction, such beauty to experience.  this is the first night we've spent apart by choice in almost two months and i think it might have been a mistake on my part because now i feel very empty, being pulled back inside my mind's chaos.  

the work i do now, the baking, gives me happiness and pride.  i feel like a pagan mixing magic brews, putting my energy into simple tactile substances and seeing them transform into food which will both sustain and please those who eat them.

i thought i'd try again today, seeing as how it's all rainy and grey once again.  but instead of sad, i started to get angry.  so.  i'll just stop trying to FORCE my emotion and go with the flow.  even though i could really use some crying.  maybe i'll punch myself in the head and see if that will get the ball rolling.

IT WAS REALLY, QUITE PRETTY.  this morning, i woke up with my best friend and fell back asleep with her.  she read poetry aloud.  later, i had a nap with kitty purring on my neck.  i sat in the park and listened to belle and sebastian and cried a much needed cry.  i received a terrific letter from my grandpappi and wrote him back an almost-as-terrific response.  i had five cups of almond tea and a gingersnap.  i read a friend's livejournal entry and couldn't leave a comment because even if he wanted me to, i don't have any idea what i could say (josh, we've got to talk some time...).  i spent two and one half hours making a mixed cd.   i just put on socks that have been roasting in front of the heater.

"event","this morning i pulled back my curtain to find my world covered in snow!  i walked around in it in the early hours, my rylie tracks intertwined with those of the raven-birds.  bright white snow, bright white moon, i love you!  such simple things can transform me... 

SO!  if i decide not to come back to school, it will most likely only be for a semester, and i might even continue on at the community college or find something else that's college-related like an internship.  i'm just feeling very overwhelmed.  a break would give me a few months to figure things out, though last spring when i took a semester off, i didn't figure anything out at all, i just fell deeper into my mess.  however, i'd stay up here, i have a job that i love and a new home,  so i don't have the option of hermit-ing myself again.  at this point, i have no idea what i'm going to do, but there's an explanation at least.   by ""drop out""  i guess i meant  ""possibly make some changes.""

on a more superficial level, my appearance could use some changin'.  it doesn't reflect how i feel on the inside at all.  and it's boring with a capital b and that rhymes with tea which is really good!  (REALLY GOOD!)  i wanna get healthy, so my muscles show and my skin is happy and my eyes sparkle.  i wanna get a hair style that chrissy hynde and debbie harry's love child would sport (in a world where hair styles are geneticly determined.  and two females can procreate.).  yeah.  80's 80's 80's!!!  i need new new newness!!!  i don't know where to start!!!

i've decided i don't care about finals.  or grades.  at all.  so that's a relief.  i can just enjoy the snow and move into my new apartment and work and drink espresso and do the jitterbug.  that's all i want.  for now, anyway..."

i ruin everything.  i should stop trying.   i'm not going to elaborate on this at all, because it's depressing.  

why do i want to move out of the dorm you ask?  so i can play sleater kinney alllll day and allll night without disturbing the girl next door who can undoubtedly hear all my racket.  i know i hear all of her racket.  she's very popular, her japanese friends come over and laugh and squeal and leave long, animated messages on her answering machine.  lord.  

the state of the world is troubling me.  i'm so tired of MONEY taking precedence over the value of human life.  every time i (stupidly) watch the news of read a paper, i hear about a new outrage.  it's all too much.  we're being really bad to each other.  we're being really bad to ourselves.  

emily was baptized last weekend and she didn't say a word about it to me until she came into my work after church, her hair still wet.  i really don't know what to make of it.   i was christened as a baby.  i wonder if that means anything at all, or if my parents were just over-excited and clueless about what to do with baby me.  i'm not christian, but maybe the ceremony has left me with a jesus-voice in my head helping me along.  jesus would overturn dubya's desk and have a fit if he came for a visit.  he'd throw a sandal.  we could use a person like him right now to talk some sense into us all.  he was awesome.  

i'm going home tomorrow.  i have a craving for really herb-y stuffing and a swig of red wine.   thanksgiving is a wonderful holiday if you ignore that whole massive-genocide-and-displacement-of-native-americans deal.  and the senseless slaughter of millions of turkeys.   but if i can ignore politics for a few hours and just fucking enjoy myself for once, it's really great.   i hope everyone has a good time.  tell me what you're thankful for.  i'll go first.  i'm thankful for the relationship i have with my mother, the new shins album, and the occasional instance that i experience hope, love and compassion in the world.   your turn!"

--go on a search for a tag a kid from work did.  then make a tag of my own, something along the lines of ""rylie wuz here, fuck bush.""
--pick up the charlotte gilman anthology from the feminist bookstore.  re-read the yellow wallpaper.  
--save the world.

my psychiatrist is.  the.  biggest.  asshole.  on the planet.   it's almost unreal how big of an asshole he is.  however!  he gave me three months of pill-moes for free so i guess that balances out his massive ego and general disinterest in the well being of his patients.  i totally wanted to knee him in the gonads.  

gotta stop talking like a, ya know, fer sure, ohmygodyerkidding, NO!!!WAY!!! gross-out.  it used to be said jokingly, but now it's found it's way into my everyday speech.  to get the nasty things out (out damn spot!) of my head, i'll wear a rubber band around my wrist and snap myself whenever i say ""totally"" ""like""  and the rest.  there is a great wealth of expository lexicon to be employed, such insipid phraseology i find to be a squanderance.  word.

i have two options:  start depriving myself of sleep and staying up until the still, silent hours of the morning in hopes of that leading to great inspiration and artistic activity, or start a strict regimen of sleep schedules, a good balanced diet, and exercise routines.  either way, i need a change of pace.  this sleep/eat/work/class/start-over-again-the-next-day vortex of meaninglessness i've found myself in doesn't do a thing for my soul.   it doesn't.  do. a  thin.g.  at all.  .  i'm on the verge of some sort of spiritual breakthrough, but i don't know which of these lifestyle modifications would better foster the surge of enlightenment i feel building up.  i think it has something to do with the connection between machines and divinity.  like that book that grandpa was trying to explain about computers being able to create patterns seen in nature...  and systems.  and brainwaves, human cells, interfaces.  lunar cycles, magnetic fields, radio waves from outerspace, mars colony, satellites, elliott coming back in dreams, runes, subliminal messages, there's more but i can't quite put my finger on it.  you know how it is...

poetry slam tomorrow.  death cab 4 cutie thursday?  if any of you go, i might see you there... dinner with the girls friday, entertaining rebecca's visiting best friend saturday, and well, sunday is the lord's day so i think i'll just sit in my rocking chair and read my bible a lot.  stick in a few shifts at work, starting and finishing my research project and studying for two tests and that sounds like a bitchin' rest-of-the-week for me."

new favorite album:  the freewheelin' bob dylan.  oh man.  lyric-o-the-moment  ""i'll let you be in my dreams if i can be in yours.""  i mean shit, that's good.  they don't write them like they used to...

simon and garfunkle are playing on phoenix sometime in the next few days.  they are magic together, i'd love to go see that.  i think s+g should be lovers.  i also think kirk and spock should be lovers.  i saw star trek the other day, and spock did a mind meld with a homicidal robot, and spock started going zonk-o (he was all ""MUST SEEK OUT IMPERFECTIONS!  MUST!!!  STERILIZE!!!"") and kirk ran to him and pulled him away from the mind meld and held him in his arms as spock regained his composure.  hot stuff.  have any of you read slash fiction?  there are some lj communities dedicated to lotr slash, and many more i'm sure.  look it up.  humans, every once in awhile, are a-okay.  

when i really like someone, i get super anxious and my limbs become cold and numb at the thought of them.  today, i have been cold and numb, so i feel in love.  or totally crushing at least.  it's a good feeling i suppose, but it's strange to think that feeling physically cold can have an effect on my emotions... 

i feel crazy, really, very crazy, at the moment, but i also feel more accepting of my insanities than i ever have.   i almost want to stay off the drugs and experience what's going on inside... but emily said i look horrible as horrible as i feel.  and i've been really mean to rebecca lately.  and just a mess in general.  so i've got some decision-making to do.  i think i need to stay on drugs (OR FIND A BETTER ALTERNATIVE!!!) as long as i'm in school.  my classes have gone to pieces, because i can't concentrate or sit still long enough to write a paper or study or read or THINK.  idon'tknowwhattodoidon'tknowwhattodoidon'tknoweverevereverwhattodo.  there's too much at stake.  whatever i decide, i'm sacrificing something vitally important to me.  i have to choose between two worlds, two different realities.  it ain't as fun as it sounds.  of course, people choose every day which reality to adopt.  i'm not alone in this.  just flip a coin, rylie, and if it doesn't work out it's not the end of the world. life goes on within you and without you.  *breathe, in out, repeat.  in out, repeat.*  i've worked myself up.  it would be ever so nice if someone were here to rub the month-old strees-induced kink out of my back and say something comforting.   alas, tonight there is no-one.  alas indeed."

it's amazing that ashley and i are still friends.  we were pissing each other off the other night because she was all ""jesus or hell, your choice"" and i was all ""nuh-uh!""  and she was all ""JESUS OR HELL, YOUR CHOICE!!!""  and i was all ""NUH!  UH!!!""   i mean really.  

it snowed this morning.  not enough to stick, but enough to make me giddy and frozen.  literally.  i don't have enough warm clothes and i was so cold this morning, it hurt to move.  but it was too pretty to complain, so i won't.  

movies i crave today (can you guess the theme?):
dancer in the dark
donnie darko
the royal tenenbaums
harold and maude

i'd really like to see any or all of them, but i don't have any with me and it's too cold to go out and rent them.  wow i'm being whiny today.  

i need some dark music (to go with my black soul).  joy division and rasputina's electronic marylin-manson collaborated albums are both on my list (the kids i work with have great taste in music.  they inspired my new interest in the genre).  any other recommendations along those lines? sorta goth/industrial/80's, but melodic and beautiful... 

i like dawn.  (yes i do).  i'm excited about having you back in my life (even if's it just an email message here and there for the time being).  

dad came to flag, but i was working all day and he was too impatient to stay. he came in to work, and on my break we got to talk... but it wasn't enough.  he hugged me goodbye in his awkward, rough way, and made me feel even more empty and alone than before.  something is wrong with my father.  he doesn't have much love in him anymore.  i think i might have pinpointed the moment that he stopped being affectionate and FUN, and turned into an alcholholic OLD MAN.  he had to have a bunch of dental work done when i was about 9.  he was in so much pain that he started drinking a lot  (a whole fucking lot) and being a grouchy bastard to everyone.   even in the past few years, when he's stopped drinking (maybe), he's been grouchy and just... loveless.  and it might be due to the fact that he drank so much for so long that even if he's sober he still acts like a drunk because all the alcohol has given him brain damage (which scares the hell out of me for some reason).  it's what they call being dry drunk.  i read about it a little.  it makes sense.  what do you think, sister, does this all sound plausible?

i feel that an era in my life is passing.  i knew things would change this year, and they are changed and changing, but in different ways than i had expected.  my job is a big part of that.  it's given me a new environment.  my family is changing.  my grandparents are unhealthy.  marla is a total stranger.  there is a certain closeness that i've lost with my mom.  i feel almost estranged from everyone i know.   i don't know them.  and they don't know me.  there's no way that i can describe the changes i've seen in myself since i've been away.  strange...

we finally got our cable hooked up in the room.  i forgot how fucking stupid laugh tracks are.  i hate television.  

elliott smith's s/t is amazing.  tears spring to my eyes every time i listen to it (it's always been this way, not just lately).  get thee to a record player.  nourish thyself with his healing harmonica.  warming waltzes.  plinkity guitar riffs, whispery vocals (three elliotts singing together is heaven.)"

i might get to see my dad tomorrow, if we can get in touch with each other... i hope i hope i hope it works out, because everyone who i love is too busy for me and i'm too busy for them.  i'm lonely, i hardly say a word to anyone all day except meaningless crap like ""what's going on?""  ""hey, how are you?""  ""WOULD YOU LIKE CINNAMON ON THAT?  WOULD YOU LIKE CINNAMON ON THAT?  WOULD YOU LIKE CINNAMON ON THAT?"" .  i'm so lonely i could just... you know.  stick a knife in my heart kind of deal.  but i won't because i wouldn't.  i am still in shock about elliott.  e-l-l-i-o-t-t, with TWO FUCKING T'S!!!  elliott the guitar man, in the rose garden, standing in a puddle, leaning over a grand piano with the sweet high voice that echoes back.  at work a guy made some idiot remark about how he killed himself because nobody liked his music anymore.   fucking ignorant asshole almost got the patented rylie look-of-death.  but there's enough hate out there (and in here).  so i pushed it down.  like everything else.  like this bullshit letter the school sent out about how they care so much about the students and so they want us to know that we should call the police right away if we're raped so ""they,"" ""the experts,"" can inspect our bodies looking for sperm samples that, if found, will just be put in some huge room of files and records of rapist's sperm samples that will gather dust and never be thought of again.  push it down rylie.  push, squish, jam, pull it down and make sure nothing comes up, ever, because it hurts when it does.   

whatever the opposite of bulumia is, is what i am.

a boy dressed as donny darko (in his skeleton costume) walked in the door, grey hoodie and all, and i just about jumped over the counter, sprinted over and threw my arms around him.  heart throb, i'm telling ya.  thumpitty thump.  he asked me to go see his band play tonight, but like always, i ran straight home from work and have hardly left the room since then.  there is just so much wrong with that, i can't start to say what.  so i won't say anything at all."

yesterday, a guest speaker came into my health class to talk.  he could see people's auras and he kept looking at me with some expression i couldn't read.  i wish i could have asked him why he kept looking at me funny.  now that i think of it, it probably had nothing to do with my aura, i probably just had a lentil stuck on the end of my nose or something silly like that.  his talk was really interesting.  i want to know more about chi gong (am i spelling that right?) and i'd like to do tai chi and all that lovely stuff.  it fits in nicely with my current views on spirituality and health.  

it's cold up here and getting colder.  the projected high for the weekend is 49.  all of my jackets are at home.  i'm going to get hypothermia and die and nobody will notice for three weeks.  great.  it's cloudy enough to see the sun right now, and it's pink.  and the sky is yellow.  armageddon began about half an hour ago and i'm not at all concerned.  hey, it's pink and yellow how bad could it be?  instead of a swarm of locusts, kittens and puppies and baby rabbits with miniature parachutes on their backs will float down from the heavens and look at us will doe eyes and bury their little heads into the crooks of our arms.  not bad at all.

"event","deep breath.  and again.  i am calm and collected.  

i shall henceforth model myself after kathleen hanna.  this morning, while sitting in front of my closet trying to decide what to wear, my arm reached for a bright, loud, stripped shirt that dear sissy gave me, but i haven't had the guts to wear it yet.  on it went, along with my headphones blaring le tigre.  it felt better than all the drab dark clothing i've been wearing, also known as my camouflage to blend in with the background as well as possible, securing my place as  wallflower.  not today.  because kathleen hanna is not a wallflower, and she's strong.  i felt a little strong...  baby steps, rylie, baby steps.

my new motto:  wwkhd?

my hair is not growing fast enough.  i almost closed the blades of my scissors around a huge handful of it, but i don't have the ovaries at the moment.  it would feel really good, but i only have about two inches until my hair is long again.  i must be patient, so that in awhile i can put it up in a kathleen hanna bouffant.  oh baby.

jill might be coming up to nau next semester.  on the one hand it's totally awesome because I LOVE MY JILLYBEAN.  but on the other hand... high school rylie is dead and gone (thank god).  i don't know how i feel about resurrecting her.  jill has surely changed as well, and maybe our relationship will be able to evolve into something as awesome as it was four years ago.  i was walking down the street the other day, and a mixture of my freshly herbal essenced hair and the smokey air, compliments of FLAGSTAFF BEING ON FIRE, smelled just like sitting in the back of jill's car listening to her and dawn try to navigate or having a conversation about people i didn't know, or singing along to one of our staple bands of the day, 311 and offspring and the beastie boys... those moments were nothing too spectacular, but they stand out as some of my happiest memories.  

moral of the story:  it's not time to quit my anti-depressants.  not the time at all..."

"event","elliott smith killed himself.  i hear he slashed himself open with a knife.  that was the wrongness i felt last night, i guess.  part of my heart went and died on me.  i don't know what to do, because on the one hand, he was a rock star.  his existance was so abstract to me, he was only a voice, a face, a slumped over figure... but on the other hand, he was the voice that MADE ME FEEL A LITTLE LESS ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE.  his heart was poetry.   his mind was mine, only better in every way...

our souls are the same... and killed himself. what if i fall into the same hopeless space that he fell in last night?   not a happy thought.  

i'm so scared of life that i stopped living.  about a month ago.  i was sitting in class and the subject matter exposed some of the most rotten feelings i carry with me.  since then, i just float though the days not feeling much.  it's different than my first depression.  that was agony, BUT AT LEAST I COULD CRY, AND SCREAM, AND FEEL SOMETHING, FEEL SOMETHING!!!  now, it's like my spirit has given up on me.  all of my sensations are shallow, and dulled, because that night in class was too much to handle and i guess my mind doesn't want to go through anything like that again.  

i've given up on that guy i thought i cared so much about.  first of all, i got too close to LIVING IN REALITY INSTEAD OF MY FANTASY WORLD.  second, you can't be in love, let alone have any sort of feelings for someone when your heart can hardly keep beating from one moment to the next.  there's no more room in my heart.  it's closed, condemned and gathering dust already.  

what flowery bullshit.  ONCE, JUST ONCE, I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT I'M ACTUALLY THINKING!!!  curse everything.  i'm sleeping until i die."

"event","something is wrong.  very much wrong (though i wouldn't go so far as to say ""horribly wrong"").  i don'tknow what it is... but.  it's... something.  and... it.  ain't.  cool.

i just feel like i could (and might) cease to exist.  actually, more like i don't exist now (i barely do by any measure) but there is an even deeper plane of non-existance that i will fall into (but FALL isn't the right word because there isn't gravity where there isn't anything.  else.  at all.).  

what does it all mean?  JIG JIG!  i don't have any idea.

today i went to the library and realized i should spend a lot more time there.  it's a nice place (sunshine!)  and it gives you an excuse to not talk to anyone (bitter librarians and nerdy grad students will give you scornful looks if you are loud). 

as of yesterday, i'm a fully trained employee at my coffeehouse of wonders.  i learned how to make coffee drinks.  they want me to try all the different kinds of beans we sell so that i can tell customers about them (oh the things i'm subjected to at this awful (awful) job).  that's great because.  uh... i like coffee and it's actually pretty exciting to be a blossoming coffee elitist... but.  uh.  oh yeah, i was trying to go decaf because I AM GOING TOTALLY FUCKING CRAZY with all these chemicals in my body.  rebecca is a bad influence;  she doesn't eat anything that doesn't come in a plastic bag or a tin can, and i'm getting used to the convenience that kind of thing offers... but the preservitives and whatever the hell else they put in there is messing with my whole body.  i feel greasy and tired and have no. energy. whatsoever.  too tired to keep.  typing....."

"event","oh man, the past six hours have been awesome.  like, AWESOME!  i feel good, and i haven't been feeling anything resembling good for a couple of days... so yeah, nothing too wonderful happened, things just have turned right side up again.   what is going on in my head?  hey-zeus.  

one of the customers tonight stole my heart.  man.  he was... so pretty.  and.  he had a strange way of talking, like a lisp or something... and... he  drank coffee.  just like me (decaf, i'm off the smack for GOOD!).  oh man, how awesome.  i am TOTALLY CRUSHING!  that cute boy i see everywhere (my stalker/stalkee) almost made me walk into a moving car today.  he was riding his bike past, and i kinda couldn't take my eyes off of him (he's so pretty!) and when i did take my eyes off him, there was a car headed towards my internal organs.  ha ha ha that would have sucked!   and alllllll my coworkers make me want to curl up in bed with them and watch m*a*s*h for hours drinking, what else, ESPRESSO DRINKS.  carl made lavender soap (for the craft fair at their church (he makes cheese too (i don't know why so don't ask))) and he gave me some and it smells nice and i just want to live in a world covered in lavender and coffee beans and peanut butter cookies!  like that dream homer has about chocolate land and he sees a candy store and he says ""mmm... chocolate, 50% off...""  and then the german guys who bought the company fire him.  and him only.  and it is AWESOME. 

and i saw FINDING NEMO TONIGHT and the auditorium was FULL and everyone was laughing and cheering and ""aww""-ing together... i was surrounded by most of my friends and i just couldn't have been much more content with life.  I LOVE DORIE THE FISH!!!  she's my homie and a half.   now i must clean my room, which is in diarray from my absolute loathing for anything other than sleeping and eating the past few days (man, i have been totally un-awesome (and when i get into my moods, i am a class-a slob  (because i want to die and who wants to spend their last waking moments washing dishes?)))  so gotta pull myself up out of my own filth and get ready to ACE MY FREAKING QUIZ TOMORROW AND THEN HAVE A ROCKING (totally awesome!)  WEEKEND!!!  ha-hoo-ra-hay!"

"event","jd samson (of le tigre) is my newest rockstar crush.  i found ""jd's lesbian calader"" at my local feminist bookstore and have been gazing adoringly at it since.  there are two people who come into work that look like jd, curly brown hair, thin+fragle looking (but tough at the same time, which is so lovely (mmm... paradoxial (my love for parethesis within parenthesis has returned full-force (or haven't you noticed?)))), huge brown eyes... i get nervous when they come to the counter and smile at me.  i press all the wrong buttons on the register and giggle nervously.  

you know what's real freaking brilliant?  i left my book, which i have to write a report about tonight, at work.  now i can't use quotes or refer to all of the notes, etc that i wrote in the margins.  i don't know what i'm going to talk about for three pages.  ""she said this really great thing, near the end of the book, about her view on a particular subject and i found it to be very enlightening.""  another A+ for me.  

doing my laundry is so fulfilling.  i love separating by color (even though at school i have to put everything in the same load to conserve my pennies), and i love how heavy wet jeans are, and i love folding tee-shirts so that they are all the same perfect rectangle and i love admiring my closet when it's well-stocked and everything is neatly organized.  it really gives me a rush.  i'm not being sarcastic.  it's one of my favorite things to do.   

two shots of espresso on an empty stomach made me high as a kite tonight.  i really need to start taking my coffee decaf, i think my internal organs are melting or something.  that ain't so good.  at least i'll be able to stay awake long enough to write my three pages of uncited, vaugue bullshitting tonight.  

oh and by the way, i am an absolute mess and i think i'm going losing my pretty little mind.u"

"event","have i mentioned my nazi professor?  he's a real problem.  on the first day of school he made a point to insult feminists, liberals, hippies and a few other classifications that i hold dear... nearly every day since then, he's been able to slip some little negative remark in, or talk about the ""culture war"" (conservatives vs. liberals, those dirty dirty humanists  (how typical, he thinks in binary terms)), and it pisses me off royally.  i feel harassed every time i attend his class, and i'm not learning anything new from him anyway, so i stopped going.  i went today because i've been ditching way too much lately, and OH MY GOD I'M GLAD I DID.  this guy gets off topic easily and just goes on and on about whatever... today, during his ramblings, he said that people just blame ""men"" or ""white people"" or ""capitalism"" for their personal problems because they are too whiney to figure it out themselves.  he said that's what feminism was,  whining. 

before i knew what was happening, my arm was in the air and i was challenging him.  my heart was racing, my hands and feet were numb, my face was flushed, but somehow i managed to keep talking to him and i didn't stop glaring at him the whole time.  i won our little staring contest.  TAKE THAT.  he talked in circles for a few minutes, and started talking at other people.  then he dropped the bomb.  

he was talking about social change and he said ""if you want to be like ghandi, go ahead.  but you know what happened to him.""

maybe i'm taking this too personally.  maybe i'm blowing this out of proportion.  but that hurt.  a lot.  ghandi is one of the only individuals i know of who keeps me from losing faith in all of humanity.  hearing his name used in that way fucking blew my mind.  i started crying, couldn't stop and had to leave class (not that i wanted to stay anyway).  couldn't that be interpreted as a death threat?   in an indirect way, if you've become as sensitive to this kind of shit as i have. 

he wants a culture war, i'll give him a culture war.  plan of action as follows:

going to his stupid worthless class every day and raising my hand every single time i feel insulted, intimidated, or any other chance i get to point out exactly how inappropriate he is.  my hand will be up a lot.  

writing feminist, revolutionary, anti-conservative, etc quotes on the board before class.  every day.  

seeing exactly what kind action i can take against him.  he makes me feel very uncomfortable, he has since about the second word that came out of his mouth.  that's not cool, and NAU would agree.  i've been documenting this shit all year, too, i have a log of the things he's said.  i'll see what i can do.

ACING HIS CLASS.  

if anyone has other suggestions to right this big dumb wrong, please share.  

just call me the thorn in his side.  rylie thorn.  that's a good name.  not that i'm trying to attack him, necessarily... it's a matter of principle.  people always ask ""what are you going to do with a degree in women's studies?""  and i didn't know what to say.  now i do.  i'm going to use my education to see when people are enforcing systems of suppression (patriarchy and a zillion others).  my degree is giving me the strength and knowledge to fight back.  my voice is wobbly and i never say the right thing, but i have a voice never the less.  i don't want to be silent anymore.

after all that, i had to be away from people so i took the urban trail a ways from school and cut into the trees.  i wandered a bit, and wonder of wonders, found a secret place.  as soon as i set eyes on it, my tears stopped.  i laid down in this little circle of trees and rested.  the clouds floated by in big billowy stripes.  two birds, mates, searched for food on the boulders about two yards away. a woodpecker walked upside down on a tree right on front of me and pecked it's little brain away.  six squirrels played on the hill in front of me.  wild flowers bounced in the wind.  it was bliss.  i'm going back and fixing the place up... drunks have left all their garbage.  pigs.  but it's mine now and i'll take care of it.  the secret garden was one of my favorite books as a kid, so this is exciting stuff. 

today i gained two new projects.  good thing i'm not busy. (that's a joke.  i'm pretty busy).  i'm still feeling unstable, but one of the articles in ""off our backs"" was about embracing neurosis and accepting them as natural parts of life that come and go.  so i'll just wait it out, and learn as much as i can from it.  

tommorrow i'm going to try to woo mr.  lovely.  again.  how many times do i have to psyche myself up for this dumb guy?  well, i'll give it a shot.  wish me luck. ""it's friday i'm in love."""

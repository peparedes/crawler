http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophile_activism

Pedophilles are trying a new tacktic (Sadly I think many of them arn't JUST dissillusioned and they truely believe this stuff) to try and justify what they're doing... There's a new 'movement' trying to get terms such as 'pedophile' removed from the books, saying that children CAN, in fact, consent to sex. >.< No they can not.  A child cannot give you informed consent to have sex.

Here are some proposed 'ethics' for this 'movement' taken directly from one of the articles above.

""Ethics proposed by the movement
Rejection of pedophilia is ingrained in some of the world's cultures, especially in modern Western ones. Despite this societal rejection, many pedophiles claim to understand children's sexuality, and have proposed an ethical framework that could allow acceptance of their desire for sexual interaction with children.

In a 1998 newspaper interview, Dutch psychiatrist Gerald Roelofs suggested the following five guidelines for relationships between adults and children:

There should be no coercion 
The child should be free to stop at any moment 
Sexuality should be compatible with the psychosexual development of the child 
The parents should know about the relationship including the sexual aspect 
The child should be able to openly discuss the relationship without fear of disapproval 
About the same time, Frans Gieles, in conjunction with the JORis workgroup of the Dutch Society for Sexual Reform (NVSH) proposed the following four guidelines:[6]

Self-Determination: Children must always have it in their own power to regulate their own sexuality, their relationships with others and their own lives. 
Initiative: Even in a later stage of the relationship, it is always the children who make the choice to have sex. 
Freedom: At any moment within the relationship with an adult, children must have the freedom to withdraw from the relationship. 
Openness: The child should not have to carry unreasonable secrets. 
More recently, subsequent discussions about these guidelines have produced a synthesis of these earlier proposals. The following four guidelines have now been officially adopted by MARTIJN and form the basis of the ethos of the Human Face of Pedophilia:

Consent of both child and adult 
Openness towards the parents of the child 
Freedom for the child to withdraw from the relationship at any moment 
Harmony with the child's development[7]""


WTF?! These are things that technically SOUND good but are absolutely not.  Children do not desire sex... Sexual desire and feelins begin to bud at puberty just like every other animal on the planet. Young, none sexually mature animals do not attempt to mate with others, why should humans?  

I'm gonna try to post pics of the symbols they use.  If I can't the above links show pics, one of pendants that have been made of the 'boy love' and 'girl love' symbols.  Thing is If I didn't know what it ment the 'girl love' pendant would be something I'd buy!  Ugh I can't figure it out, however the wickipidia link shows the better symbols in color rather than in black and white.  The symbols are u sed so they can identify each other

Edit: I found on myspace a post with the codes for the pictures.   Below is quoted


""parents (and children) need to know about the sick, sick movement known as ""pedophile activism"". I am not joking. Look up pedophile activism on wikipedia.org for more information. They have created these symbols, so that they can identify each other, create a support network, it's sickening:


<img src=""http://img466.imageshack.us/img466/347/blogozy8.jpg"">
This is the symbol for ""boy love"" called BLogo

<img src=""http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/3826/160pxglogokt2.png"">
This is the symbol for ""girl love"", called GLogo

<img src=""http://img459.imageshack.us/img459/7117/clmedialogo01150xa7.png"">
This is the symbol for ""Childlove Online Media Activism, CLOMAL

<img src=""http://img478.imageshack.us/img478/5158/pedophilebutterflyec2.png"">
This is the symbol for all-encompassing pedophilia, CLogo

If you see these symbols on someone's Myspace, they are a pedophile. 
If you see someone with one of these symbols on their clothing or jewelry, they are a pedophile. Anyone with children, please visit Wikipedia's article on Pedophile Activism""


Though one thing I would like to add is that the jewelry could possibly be obtained by a none-pedophile not realizing what it means, especially the heart.  It's not something most people would associate with pedohpillia especially someone who just plain happens to like hearts.  if you want to get the codes for the pictures to post this on your lj or myspace or whatever go to this link http://forum.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=messageboard.viewThread&entryID=26480065&adTopicID=23&categoryID=0&IsSticky=0&groupID=103946028&Mytoken=C84DFA0E-7DA9-4D19-823E68908B385DBC60220556 then click quote and it'll give you the codes for the pics and stuff, just remember to  delete a-href code before the words 'pedophile activisim when it mentions the wikipidia article on it.  It'll turn your entry from then on into a big ol link... >.<

The other links, which I got from a friend's lj whom alerted to this in the first place via her lj entry are also there because I know that sometimes Wikipidia's info isn't wholey accurate and they're posted to confirm yes this is a sick and sad truth.

The symbols they use are actually pretty innocent looking, even cool and I would never think to associate them with pedophilia until I found out about it just today.  And you know what I think that's the point...

What a sad world we live in.. -_-,

"event","For those of you who experianced diffaculty with Yahoo the other day I'm posting what the deal was.  Someone else on LJ discovered what it was and I'm just passing along the knowledge.   This is a direct quote from her LJ

""Everyone please add v3@yahoo.com to your blocked address list.  It's a worm that took out Yahoo yesterday and is still running around.

My browsers are still a little fucked up from it and I didn't even get the worm directly.

Updating firewalls and antiviruses today wouldn't hurt either.""

Not sure wehre she foudn it out but it doesn't matter really.  It's the reason yahoo screwed up before.  I think it may be related to the ""New graphics site"" worm that was taking advantage of the yahoo mail delivery system with yahoo groups (some of the groups I'm on were sending it under the names of it's members.) Btw if you see that in your inbox, especially from a group, just delete it.  If you open it it'll virus you without touching the supposed attatchment.

Thought I'd spread the knoweldge"

"event","Taken from CD and I agree.  So much is said to women about how to prevent getting raped but hardly anything to people who have a tendance for rape.  In my opinion it's a good idea to be cautious like that anyway because there isn't as much telling these people who will 'take some' whether the other wants it or not as there is warning how to prevent rape.  It's never the fault of the victim no matter what she was wearing/doing/drinking... Anyway..







A lot has been said about how to prevent rape.
Women should learn self-defense. Women should lock themselves in their houses after dark. Women shouldn't have long hair and women shouldn't wear short skirts. Women shouldn't leave drinks unattended. Fuck, they shouldn't dare to get drunk at all.


instead of that bullshit, how about:

if a woman is drunk, don't rape her.
if a woman is walking alone at night, don't rape her.
if a women is drugged and unconscious, don't rape her.
if a woman is wearing a short skirt, don't rape her.
if a woman is jogging in a park at 5 am, don't rape her.
if a woman looks like your ex-girlfriend you're still hung up on, don't rape her.
if a woman is asleep in her bed, don't rape her.
if a woman is asleep in your bed, don't rape her.
if a woman is doing her laundry, don't rape her.
if a woman is in a coma, don't rape her.
if a woman changes her mind in the middle of or about a particular activity, don't rape her.
if a woman has repeatedly refused a certain activity, don't rape her.

if a woman is not yet a woman, but a child, don't rape her.
if your girlfriend or wife is not in the mood, don't rape her.
if your step-daughter is watching tv, don't rape her.
if you break into a house and find a woman there, don't rape her.
if your friend thinks it's okay to rape someone, tell him it's not, and that he's not your friend.

if your ""friend"" tells you he raped someone, report him to the police.
if your frat-brother or another guy at the party tells you there's an unconscious woman upstairs and it's your turn, don't rape her, call the police and tell the guy he's a rapist.

tell your sons, god-sons, nephews, grandsons, sons of friends it's not okay to rape someone.

don't tell your women friends how to be safe and avoid rape.
don't imply that she could have avoided it if she'd only done/not done x.
don't imply that it's in any way her fault.
don't let silence imply agreement when someone tells you he ""got some"" with the drunk girl.
don't perpetuate a culture that tells you that you have no control over or responsibility for your actions. You can, too, help yourself.



If you agree, repost it. It's that important.

I'm all for bringing back a very effective form of punishment for this sort of transgression: Giving the man convicted of it over to the family of their victim to do with whatever they choose. There wasn't much savagery (rape - there was no separate word for it in ancient Cymraic/Bretonian) until this form of punishment was abolished in favour of 'more humane' punishments."

I took the dang citronella home again... Oh well... I'm working tomorrow anyway.  With Kathy though... I really dun wanna... Kathy's cool but she can really be a pain... Guess It comes with the territory of being a correctional officer. *shudders* I couldn't stand her primary job... All those murderers and rapests... Noooooway! One thing I'm terrified of is rape, because I'm also terrified of sex.  I mean you wouldn't think of it the way I talk about it/rp it online, but in real life if I have the oppurtunity to have sex I'm like 'No... sorry can't do it.'  All'oppurtunities' I've had except for one, have either been with females (twice, both times it was pushed on me Crystal tried to rape me and succeeded in molesting me because I had to freaking lock up.  Jennifer tried to pressure me and I wasn't comfortable, becides I can't have sex with FRIENDS! *No longer counts Crystal* Yuck!) or with men way too old for me.. Though one wasn't much older than me, but he was icky.  He had these weird eyes and all he could talk about was me giving him 'pussy' I'm like, ""NO!""  Yeesh why screw somebody you barely know?


Anyway little ones doing well. ^^ we got a litter in yesterday morning... I put a cat in quarinteen that I knew was pregnant, but as she was also highly friendly and I didn't think she was that far along so I figured it was safe to go ahead and hold her for 6 days for her owner to show up... *Really hates that pregnant animal euthanasia policy*  Hopefully these kittens will be okay.. See every litter of kittens born at the shelter have gotten sick because of the close quarters... It's diffacult to control disease... anyway she had four healthy looking little ones> ^^ No wonder she wasn't very big, she didn't have a very big litter.  Heck one cat once had 2 kittens and didn't even LOOK pregnant. lol ^^  Funny thing happened.  A woman today called animal control on a kitten she found... which turned out the be the BOSSES little critter!  It was like 2 weeks old and she came in later to reclaim the little guy, bringing in a coworker because she doesn't like cats... Oie.. anyway I gave her a voucher to give to her boss to have the little guy fixed later.   He doesn't have to fix a reclaim but it helps knock some money off his bill if he does. ^^  Hopefully it'll keep her from getting TOO much in trouble. *smirks* Anyway gotta take a shower now.. I is dirty. ^^"

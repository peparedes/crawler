"event","wow!  since i really dont have too much to do here at college yet i'm doing really good at keeping this here thing updated.  tomma i am finally going home and i have so many plans for this weekend i know its gonna go super fast and that sucks a lot.  i want to freeze time on this weekend forever.  i can't wait to see timmy. he is so cute. he sends me email all the time and i just love that.  i love getting mail from him becuz it makes me feel like someone back home really misses me and thats a really cool feeling.  in his last email he told me to listen to the ataris track 12 and said that that was our song and that is just so freaking cute.  its such a pretty song and when i listened to it i thought about all the times timmy would be singing when that song was on and it made me feel like he was singing it to me and i wanted to cry...I AM SO CORNY!! 

 my chinese culture class is crazy.  we have to write a 600 word essay every week and thats what our grade is gonna be based on in the end...GAY!!  tomma my scheduale is jam packed and i'm not really looking forward to it.  i have psyche at 10 which isn't too bad cuz i like that class to some degree and then i have an hour to kill so i'll prolly just get something to eat and check my email cuz then i have to go all the way over to the art building for my art history recitation at 12.  then i have to practically run to my english comp class which i'm not too fond of and i prolly wont run cuz even if i did everyone would be passing me by.  (i feel like i move in slow motion here.  everyone is in such a hurry and i'm not in as good of shape as i thought i was cuz i wanna die just walking across campus.)  then i have english lit at 2 but thats in the same building so thats ok.  then i am done for the weekend.  then i am coming back to my room and packing until my mom gets here.  

YAY.  i'm done

"event","<P>well here i am sitting in my dorm again doing absolutely nothing.&nbsp; im so pathetic.&nbsp; i will probably spend my night reading ahead in my english classes waiting for timmy to call.&nbsp; thats fine with me.&nbsp; trust me i dont mind being here.&nbsp; i like it in my room.&nbsp; sometimes i just get a little restless and want to stretch a little.&nbsp; but then i go for a walk to the bathroom or something and that feeling goes away.&nbsp; </P>
<P>i was supposed to hang out with chuck today.&nbsp; i waited forever for him.&nbsp; then he called and said he wasn't coming.&nbsp; he got into a car wreck.&nbsp; thats weird.&nbsp; he just cracked up.&nbsp; he said he's ok and his car is drivable but he was lost in carnegie and i have no idea were pti is so it would have been kinda hard for me to give him directions home.&nbsp; </P>
<P>well gladys andrews called me at 8:00 this morning.&nbsp; she said i cant relocate this semester and if i wanted to do it next semester i'd have to go to the dean's office and get a letter stating why i want to move.&nbsp; i doubt i'll end up doing that.&nbsp; i am actually starting to like it here. i'm starting to know my way around a little better and i really enjoy some of my classes.&nbsp; dont get me wrong!!!&nbsp; i still want to go home really bad and after i do i may not want to ever come back but i will and i'll get into the routine of coming to school during the week and seeing my family on the week ends.&nbsp; the weeks will begin to go faster and before ya know it we'll be in october and it will be getting colder and mid-terms will be here and then snow and thanksgiving vacation and then finals! and then it'll be the end.</P>
<P>oh poo i have to remember to go see my advisor tomma!!.&nbsp; and i have to get my books for physics and art.&nbsp; and i have to call dell about that stupid computer.&nbsp; what a great idea that was. i'm such an idiot.&nbsp; well that was a short update.&nbsp; i dont really know what else to say.&nbsp; i'm going to the movies on sat. and to tyler's football game (thats timmy's little brother) if i'm lucky his dad won't talk to me at all!&nbsp; we're gonna see the second exorcist movie and i'm gonna pee my pants and prolly cry.&nbsp; chrissa might go with us.&nbsp; i should clean out my car.&nbsp; i should do that friday night.&nbsp; timmy said something about going out with a friend of his and his girlfriend but i dont remember when we're supposed to do that.&nbsp; we're supposed to go for hot wings.&nbsp; i have to remember to spend time with my family too cuz last time i felt really bad for not seeing them and then leaving so maybe we can have a cook out on sunday.&nbsp; maybe timmy would be allowed to go to that.&nbsp; i could pick him up from work at 4 and take him home later.&nbsp; if his fucking dad would let him do anything.&nbsp; </P>"

<P>well i'm in pittsburgh.&nbsp; college...need i say more.&nbsp; i hate it.&nbsp; not really.&nbsp; right now at this moment i am kinda apathetic about it.&nbsp; i dont have that much work right now and the homesickness has started to come and go.&nbsp; for the first two days tho i just cried and cried and cried.&nbsp; i miss home so bad.&nbsp; i miss my friends and i miss my boyfriend and i miss my family.&nbsp; i know that i prolly wouldn't see them all the time anyway but just knowing that they're right there and i can drive over and see them or call them is a really reassuring feeling that i miss a lot.&nbsp; i keep talking about relocating to UPJ but in all actuality i like this campus.&nbsp; everyone is super nice here and there is so much diversity and so much to do.&nbsp; i wish i could just pack everyone up in a suit case and bring them with me cuz i know i would seriously love it if i had the people i cared about here with me.&nbsp; i just dont understand how these girls can just pick up and leave everything.&nbsp; they keep asking me to hang out with them and i feel like such a loser saying no all the time but the truth of the matter is: i dont want to hang out with them, i dont want to make new friends.&nbsp; i am far too lazy for that.&nbsp; i hate getting to know new people.&nbsp; i just want to go to class come home do my homework and be left alone.&nbsp; i have a life back home...i dont want one here.&nbsp; i just keep thinking that maybe i'm making a mistake by sheltering myself.&nbsp; maybe i'm making a mistake by trying to go back home.&nbsp; what if they don't take me back if i decide pitt is better.&nbsp; what if i regret it my whole life.&nbsp; sitting here thinking about it now kinda makes me think that i will end up sticking it out...at least until christmas break.&nbsp; i can always transfer for the spring semester.&nbsp; i could get used to seeing timmy on the weekends but what i actually keep thinking is that i will see him is three days.&nbsp; i fail to remember that i must then come back here on monday.&nbsp; that will be a tough one.&nbsp; knowing what i come back to.&nbsp; i want to go back to high school.&nbsp; why cant this be last year.&nbsp; i wouldn't mind being in high school my whole life.&nbsp; changing the subject again back to relocating...i would disappoint a lot of people.&nbsp; not only would i disappoint people, i would confirm those thoughts of failure many people had for me.&nbsp; the salutorian failing in her college experience!&nbsp; ""she's not as smart as we thought she was""&nbsp; and timmy's dad...what of timmy's dad.&nbsp; A-hole indeed.&nbsp; he would kill me...or at least make me wish someone would kill me.&nbsp; he freaked out on me when i came home.&nbsp; what would he say then.&nbsp; he was so nice about it before.&nbsp; i miss that so much.&nbsp; for a while i really did feel like i had a father figure in my life finally.&nbsp; fuck that shit&nbsp; i dont know what i was thinking.&nbsp; he's such an asshole.&nbsp; i'm so fucking scared of what he'll think that i cant even begin to think about whats best for me.&nbsp; i cant even imagine what it would be like moving out of here.&nbsp; they would think i was such a loser.&nbsp; i wasted so much money on stuff...i guess if i move into a dorm at UPJ i could use it there.&nbsp; i dont know what to do.&nbsp; maybe i'll just wait until this weekend to decide...see how i feel about going home and coming back.&nbsp; </P>"

"event","<P>well well well...last night i had work until 11.</P>
<P>then i went to alicia's house and we sat around for a long time and then we dicided to go get heather and paint our names under my bridge since i am moving soon then we got a call from wendy to go and get her and then DG made me promise to come back and then we went to my house and me and my mom got into a fight and then alicia took me to my car at her house and me n wendall left and i think alicia was mad but i dont care...heather said alicia and her hung out until 4 am and i must admit i am a lil mad about it cuz they were acting like they wanted to go home forever until i left.&nbsp; heathers like ""we had a lot of fun"" like rubbing it in.&nbsp; i dont know tho cuz i am cranky cuz i slept a lot today and i am sick.</P>
<P>me n wendy went to DG's house and i guess it was fun...they watched porn for a long time and it was really hot and boring until we turned the lights out and just started talking...we talked until after 5 am.&nbsp; i want to go get breakfast but no one could cept wendall so i figured we'd just wait til the way home.</P>
<P>i wanted to go look at the stars today but then i decided not to cuz i don't feel very good and it is muddy outside.&nbsp; i am gonna be an astronomer...among other things: </P>
<P>a plastic surgeon</P>
<P>an english &nbsp;teacher (but only to smart high school students...like an AP class)</P>
<P>a journalist (i want to have my own music zine an i want to travel around with bands and live out of my car and write)</P>
<P>anyway...tomma i have to work from 4-11 and i have to close the kitchen becuz a kid got fired a week ago and they need someone to work for him and i said yes not knowing that they'd put me in the kitchen and i really dont wanna do it but seriously every single person at BK is working tomma and that sucks cuz i was gonna try to switch someone.&nbsp; i'm so dead.&nbsp; we're gonna be there forever and i hate, hate, hate making food!!!</P>
<P>i'm kinda depressed cuz i miss high school.&nbsp; i miss my friends. i just keep thinking bout all those good friends that i haven't seen in a million years. that sucks cuz i still live around here.&nbsp; whats gonna happen when i move away??</P>
<P>tomma i must wake up early so i can go to j-town and put flowers on my daddy's grave.&nbsp; i have work 10-7 on sunday so i won't have time then.&nbsp; grrr.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;i am depressed.&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;i want to cry and never stop.&nbsp; </P>
<P>i miss my dad.&nbsp; i dont talk about it much but since no one ever reads my journal which is obvious by the lack of comment i will write about it. i am a lot like my daddy.&nbsp; i look a lot like him too.&nbsp; i remember little bits of him...but only good bits.&nbsp; i wish he could see me now.&nbsp; sometimes i think bout how my life would be different if he were still alive.&nbsp; who would i be?&nbsp; where would i be?&nbsp; is he proud of me?</P>
<P>when we were younger alicia would tell me the stict guidelines u had to follow in order ot go to heaven and that here was no purgatory and that lots of people go to hell and i wa sad. </P>
<P>after all of that time thinking that my father could possibly suffering for all eternity in hell i decided that there really is a purgatory and that if someone dies who is a good person pretty much that he will be punished for those sins and then go to heaven so i think my dad is in heaven and i think lots of people go to heaven and its retarded not to think that an ever forgiving god would not want his children to go to heaven even if they did make some mistakes...anyway i dunno what the hell i'm talking bout anymore so i'm just gonna call it quits and go to bed.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I've never been to the cemetary by myself...I wonder if I'll cry?</P>"

"event","<P>well i guess i should update this thinger...in case ur wondering the reason i haven't updated is becuz my computer is retarded and when i start it up i have to end task every single program except this ccap thing and most of the time it freezes and i hate it and have no patience. luckily my good ole sis happened to be around to help&nbsp; me with this complicated task.&nbsp; </P>
<P>well anyway...i graduated.&nbsp; YAY! (as tears well up in my poor lil eyes) i'm gonna miss high school so bad.&nbsp; as i was walking into the commons that night i suddenly began having my second panic attack in two months.&nbsp; i never had them before in my life until this year.&nbsp; it sucked i just started hyperventilating and crying and it was scary but after that i was A-ok.&nbsp; i didn't even cry that much and i was salutorian which was nice.&nbsp; the speeches were good and that best part of all was at the end when jack and travis surprised everyone by sneaking cans of silly string and spraying it everywhere...that brought a tear to my eye.&nbsp; we weren't allowed to throw our caps which is super DUMB!&nbsp;&nbsp; altoona high school was allowed and my sister said it looked so good!</P>
<P>that night i went to joe's house and got a lil drunk...there was only me, heather, alicia, ashley, joe, and keith but i was with my two best friends so i was content.&nbsp; we spent the night and that was fun.&nbsp; </P>
<P>oh and my car died like two days before graduation...that sucks a lot.&nbsp; at first it was only 150 to get it fixed (my timing belt broke) then it went up to 400 (my water pump and struts broke) and now it is 500 (my spring is also broken)!!!&nbsp; all this so it can pass inspection.&nbsp; gee golly thats a lot of money for lil ole moi.&nbsp; what the hay am i gonna do.&nbsp; swindlers everyone is a swindler.&nbsp; u'd think he'd give me a discount cuz i'm a beautiful, broke, college student but no...no discount.&nbsp; i've been without a car for over a week now...i am in agony!</P>
<P>i went to the show last night...the best band around played and did super great.&nbsp; of course i am talking bout classic rivalry.&nbsp; i love them!&nbsp; i was scared i was gonna miss them cuz i had work til 8 but all worked out.&nbsp; i went to the cave for the after party.&nbsp; twasn't bad.&nbsp; i'm dumb.&nbsp; oh well what are ya gonna do!?!&nbsp; anyways today is my mama's birthday and i took her to Ryan's and got her two shirts with the money that i should be saving for my car and my lap top and my books and everything else that i will not have enough money to buy but it was worth it cuz she's my mama and deserves lots of presents.&nbsp; </P>
<P>last night wendy yelled at scotty&nbsp; becuz i had a crush on him last year and she told him and i guess he didn't like me cuz he didn't really care and for some reason she was mad and she yelled cuz we didn't go to the punk prom together becuz we both thought we were joking and stuff.&nbsp; i dont even remember why she was mad but she was and it was weird cuz i she just brought it up out of nowhere.&nbsp; i wish scott would have liked me back then.&nbsp; i liked him a lot.&nbsp; actually i still like him a lot.&nbsp; i tried to talk to nate last night and be civil.&nbsp; i tried.&nbsp; i think i did good.&nbsp; he should know that just becuz i dont hate him now doesn't mean that i like him and if he doesn't quit hurting my sister that i <EM>will&nbsp; </EM>have him effed up...that would be sad too cuz his band is doing quite good and he wouldn't be able to play for a while cuz he would be in the hospital getting he limbs reattached and reconstructive surgery and he would be out of practice and bring the whole band down and they would kick him out and he would be depressed and bad things would happen.&nbsp; i'm just saying he should think of his band.&nbsp; be nice to my sista...treat her like the princess she is.</P>

"event","well well well...six days no work.  life is good...kinda.  well as everyone knows lil joey died thur. night.  its a really sad thing but i'm not gonna be like many of those other poser, wanna-be ""friends"" and say about how much i'm gonna miss him because to be completely honest, i haven't said two sentences to him in about four years.  i will say that back in the ole days when we were friends, he was a really great guy and obviously still was.  he was my first kiss and the first person that actually made me feel comfortable talking about my dad's death.  i, however, had not talked to him since the summer before 8th grade so i am not feeling the fullness of his loss.  my sister on the other hand was good friends with him.  she called me at heather's house that night crying and begging me to come home.  what was i supposed to do?  you can't make someone feel better in those kind of situations.  sure i threw the same ole cliches at her. ""he's in a better place.""  ""there was nothing you could have done.""  ""he knew how much you cared about him.""  obviously that does nothing for anybody.  i know.  i went through the feeling of loss before.  so instead i drove wendy up to sarah's and sat in the car waiting for her to get home for over an hour so that she wouldn't find out over the internet like wendy did.  unfortunely they never came home and even if they did sarah had already found out at her cousin's...over the internet.  
wendy hasn't been doing that bad.  she's had people to talk to about it.  my mom has been such a bitch to her though.  like she's going out of her way to be even more mean to her.  my mom and i have been getting into it a lot lately about that.  i just can't take it.  wendy's a really emotional person.  she feels super bad when they fight and i think my mom knows it.  my mom hated fighting with me when i was wendy's age.  i don't feel bad about that shit at all.  i know her fucking tricks and when she tries to lay that guilt shit on me it makes makes me even more angry.  i'm a very mean person, very insensitive.  no one realizes it though.  
well i had a lot of stuff i wanted to write but now i dont feel like typing anymore so thats all for now."

"event","troy carl is my friend.  We are in the library at school.  We just got back from helping to save mother earth.  We were picking up garbage for the national honor society.  no offense mama earth but i just did it for the donuts!  troy needs to get his hair cut.  he looks like a lil gurl but a cute lil gurl!!
troy plays the sax.  i play the trumpet.  we were in band together last year.  he stole my shoe one day and tried to lick my foot.  i was SCARED!!!  it was so much fun.  now band sucks cuz he is not there with me.  he made band fun and now i cry everyday cuz my heart longs to be with him again."

"event","I am finally home.  Today I worked a 9-hour shift at BK.  What a fucking lousy day.  It was busy all day and we were short and I was supposed to leave at 7 but somehow got suckered into staying until ""nine"" which apparently actually meant eleven.  I hate that place so bad.  I wanna quit but I don't wanna be broke either.  I have so many anger problems because of that place.  I'm horrible to the customers, so if ya ever come through the drive-thru at the Ebensburg BK and a really rude girl waits on you, its prolly me!  Sorry, I just hate my job. 
My mother still isn't home.  She was supposed to be home almost 2-hours ago.  I'm actually really worried 'bout her.  I hope she gets here soon so I can go to bed and have some peace of mind.
Nate wants to hang out tonight but I really don't feel like driving all the way to Ebensburg again.  I am seriously beat.  I have to call him when my mom gets home.  If I tell him that, he's gonna be so mad, but I really don't care anymore. (Oh shit I think my mom's home...That better be fucking her!)  I have to tell Nate that I don't like him.  (yup its her)  I hope he's not an asshole to me at work cuz I love working with him.  He's one of our best but we are so different it's not even funny.  He parties every weekend.  I barely even drink.  He hangs out with all these burn out druggy shallow people.  I like mellow, smart, ambitious people.  i like people who are deep.  Who you can have a conversation with.  I hate racist.  I hate black jokes.  I hate it when people use the N-word.  I hate that shit and he's like that.  There is so much about him that I just can't take.  
By the way in case you were wondering about the band concert on Friday.  It was ok I guess.  It was so hot on stage that I had to leave every time the chorus came on stage cuz I didn't feel good.  I messed a lot of stuff.  I messed up the introduction cuz I couldn't say Mr. Glen Kerr.  (SO EMBARRASSING!!!)  I didn't mess up my solo in Chicago so that was good.  Jason got the Louis Armstrong Jazz award which he said he felt bad about and he really shouldn't.  I'm really proud of him cuz he's come so far in the past 9 months and he's pretty much the only in the percussion/guitar section besides weber that actually cares about what he's playing.  I must admit, though, that I was kinda disappointed that I didn't get an award.  I taught myself to play the trumpet.  I've been playing for three years and I'm as good as people playing for twice that.  I joined band this year because of Ms. G, cuz she asked me to.  I should of taken AP Calculus.  Anyway it was actually Jason who got the award and who deserved the award.  I can see it now:  In 5 years, when he's a famous musician and they're doing his VH1 driven episode, they'll make sure to mention that he received the Louis Armstrong Jazz Award.  It'll be great.  Megan got the other award which we knew would happen.  She is THE musician of the highlander concert band."

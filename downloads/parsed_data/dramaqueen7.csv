"event","Wow, it's been SOOO long since I've done an update it's rediculous. I promise I'm not dead! I've just wandered off into the pain and hell that is Texas. I've been here since July... yea that's a long time, because if you can remember way Way WAY back to February when I left on this adventure that I call the Army. If you don't know why it's been a hot minute since I've been home, I'll catch ya up to speed.
~I broke my hand in Basic or ""bootcamp"" whichever you prefer.
~Ended up doing bootcamp twice and not just picking up where I left off. Joy
~I didn't leave till my graduation on July 8th
~Got to Ft. Sam Houston on July 9th
~The Army ""damaged"" my feet
~Then ""damaged"" my ankles.... knees... hips... and back. *sigh*
~I'm FINALLY in classes to get my job
~The classes are 6 wks and counting
~I'm coming home on Dec 21st!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

PRAISE THE LORD! I'm coming home for like 2 wks, then I go back to Ft. Sam... bleh I know... do some MORE training for 2 wks, graduate 19 Jan O6 and then I'm home for good! I can't believe it's been like a year since I've been gone, but I'm more than happy to finally go back. I actually miss California. Santa Rosa even, omg.

"event","Today was totally moving. I volunteered at the armory to help set up and prepare the place for the soldiers coming home today. I mingled, and shmoosed the families there.. lol ok not exactly like that. I was too busy setting up food, watching the children, and talking to the four Color Guardsmen to really do too much mingling. The soldiers that came home today went through hell and back it seemed like just to get home to their families. It took like all morning till 3 to get them home. It was on the news and stuff which was pretty sick. Channel 4, 7, and some other one, 101.7 and a journalist showed up to document this wonderful occasion.  The mayor and Brig. Gen. of the unit showed up as well. So many people, so much love. I took pictures and I swear when the vans rolled up, after the caravan of cops, and got out to their families I really teared up. I don't even know those men but to see them interact with each other and their families was just amazing. 

LOL and on top of that I got me some dates before I leave. Ya know, just to get it out of my system before I take off on Monday. *wink wink* Then I can really focus when I get there. 

I can't wait. I'll be gone till early September (Like Whit said) so if ya wanna see me or call me before I go, ya better do it quick. lol. 

Other than that I guess this'll be my last post till I get back!! Woot!

I love you all, and ... yeah. hehe

OOO sadly I wont know what my address will be until I get there, so if I have your address, I'll send you something to let you know I'm alive and hopefully one of you will post it for me. That would be fab. 

Love Always,
~Sarah~

P.S. If y'all haven't seen the Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again on Comedy Central... you sooo should! Those guys are hilarious... I love Larry the Cable Guy!!!  hehe ok I'm done"

It's not really that long... ok maybe kinda-- that's like half a year GAH!! lol Only the first 9 weeks I'll be without contact so THAT's not really that long. 

I'm excited otherwise. I'm really looking forward to it. 

LA was fab! I had a blast there with Lissa, Val, Jenny, Christine, Kurt and Jordan. Salsa dancing, saying up till 1 am, pizza movies, Attack of the Pooh, Gunther, Boy-o-boy, Dirty dancing, Little Mermaid, shopping and all that good stuff. lol Hopefully I'll see them again soon. *hugs*

I really hope I can go. If not, people keep telling me it's for the best and I guess it really will be. I'll be useles with my leg like shit if I go.. soo.. *shrug*

"event","Today was the very first day EVER that I drove to San Francisco and back home. Wow. I was totally stoked but then it occurred to me that the majority of my friends had already done that. Oh well, yay for me cuz that was the first time. My sister, niece, Chan and I went to the Charles Dickens Christmas Fair at the Cow Palace. OMG that place rocks!!! There's people in costumes with accents walking around, Scrooge, the Three Christmas ghosts, Tiny Tim and so on are like walking around talking to people. they like stop and act out scenes when they bump into each other. We played games, got our pictures taken vintage style, watched people sing, dance and pretty much had a ball. 

I'm definitely going back next year with a costume and an accent. Woot. The whole time we were walking around, Chan and I wanted to start talking with an English accent. lol.

On another note, I'm teaching myself to play the guitar. I'm making quite a progress, I can like play a song (for the most part-and I've just started yesterday) so I'm pretty stoked about that. 

I'm tired as hell and beginning to wonder if anyone really reads this.. or if I'm just wasting my time.

"event","Ok if you read Leslie's journal then you know how the Robert's funeral went. If not, it was really really nice. The burial killed me, I was next to Justin and Leslie, but when the casket started to lower Robert's mom cried so hard you couldn't help but cry because you felt how much pain she was in. I put a rose on top of his casket and that was like my final goodbye. I didn't go to the reception, although I feel like I should have now. I do feel more at peace with his death, and that he is in a better place. I couldn't stand to see him in the hospital and weak. When I do think about him, which needless to say is frequent, I can smile more often than cry because I know how much good he did in the 18 years that he was alive, and how many lives he touched. 

I also went to the unit's annual Christmas party. That was fun, I helped kids with their ornament making and when Santa showed up I was the elf... yea I said it, I was an elf. lol

That's about it, except that my parents are coming home on Wed from their anniversary getaway to Hawaii.. bleh I want to go there. So I've been watching the sibs since last Friday. fun fun fun.. ohhh yea.

"event","Why is there always one person who hones in on another person who is hurting? Honestly I don't get it. There's a saying that goes something like never kick a person while they're down. Yea, some people don't grasp that while someone is in a fragile state, that is not the best opertunity to start accusing them of things they never said or did. Fucking drama. No one seems to get that there's a bigger picture than ""oh, will that guy ever like me?""... ""oh, my hair looks like crap today, I can't leave the house."" WTF? 

Maybe it's me being moody, but I don't know how much drama/shit I can take and if I hear one more time ""little miss innocent over there (refering to me) I can't believe you did... blah blah blah"" Some relationships are worth fighting for, but this one is like dangling on a thread before I cut it loose forever. It's not worth the stress

Ever since I read that damn email saying that Robert was gone, I can't even think about him without crying. Knowing that I'll never get to talk to him, see him, touch him ever again is the worst thing in the world. He was one of my best friends and it kills me. I feel like I should have been there for him more, gone to visit him more, read up on his illness more and then maybe he'd still be here fighting. I feel like if I hadn't read the email, he'd still be here.

He was (even the past tense seems surreal to me) one of the most frank people I know. If he had something to say, he'd say it. Not dance around it like most people. I could talk to him about anything and I knew that even if he didn't have an answer, he was still there for me. 

Some of the best memories I have of high school are with him.
I love you and I'm going to miss you soo soo much Robert.

"event","Does anyone want a puppy? I can't keep my dog. She's a German Shepard Mix (boxer). Her name is Gidget, she's roughly 5-6 months old. I just got her, and the guy didn't have any papers on her. He's temporarily in between homes at the moment and didn't have enought money to pay for the shots the dor needs. 

She's well behaved, potty trained (she sits by the door and whines when she needs out). She's great with kids, teens and adults. She knows how to sit, stay, lay down and go outside on command. She'll come on command as well (if you smack your thigh to get her attention, she'll come faster).  

Ok that's all. Byee

"event","I just got back from my one weekend a month drill at Camp Parks. OMG am I tired, damn. I had 5 Drill Sergeant swarming me and my platoon. The normal Sgts that were incharge last month like took the back seat this time. 

Ok Saturday: I got there at like 8 am. I was the first one there so I was a lil nervous.. scratch that.. VERY nervous. I wasn't focusing and/or paying attention to details so I was dropped (a.k.a. drop down on the ground and do push ups till they tell you to stop) 3 times within the first 30 mins of my arrival. GAH I really need to work on my push-ups. I'm sooo sore from doing them. Once for having on the wrong gear, once for not being loud enough and once more for half smiling. We then signed in, marched, got yelled at, marched, ate, marched etc. It rained like almost the whole day on Sat. So that meant I had to pull my poncho out of my cargos, put it on within a certain amout of time, then put it back in my cargo and button the pocket within a certain amout of time and if I wasn't done doing what I was told in that amount of time, they dropped us. The whole platoon was dropped in the rain with gear and ponchos on, on gravel because we took too long to line up in formation (the rows of soldiers u see on tv that makes us look all spiffy when we march). My knee got all banged up and lil rocks stuck in my palms. 

Sunday: I got sick from the rain and almost threw up :x So my Drill Sgts didn't want me or my battle buddy to go near the rest of the platoon for fear of me getting the other sick. I had to clean up after everyone while they all went to do a PE type thing. Luckily I wasn't the only sick/disabled soldier there. My illness is soo not gunna fly at BCT so I have to get my amune system up before then. 

My, my, my I have a lot of things to work on. lol

Lissa!! I had fun seeing you again! I missed u. Ur puppy is soo cute omg :) We'll have to do that again over Xmas break. I promise I wont be as tired then lol.

Whit, J, and I went to Subway while waiting for Lissa to arrive home from her day at SF with Ta. That was fun. The homeless guy was scary. I wanted to wind up my window on him. GAH :/

"event","Wow I've only updated once this month, interesting. Ok I shall fix that.... now.

This is what's been going on in my busy busy life:

*Rain had her first birthday on the 9th. We had 2 parties for her. One for fam, one for friends. I went to both, the friends party was more fun I must admit. My sis can throw one hell of a party. 
*The only thing I do regret about that party was not doing a keg stand. bummer. Well, there's always next time. 
*I got into a cake fight at the friend party. The entire cake was smashed on my head along with a massive slice on a plate .. that stuck to my hair. That was like the most fun I've had in a long long time. 
*I got into a veggie fight at said party. One on one with a platter of veggies. Peppers and carrots flying and going down shirts. Good stuff

*I was really good about exercising today. Gym for an hr, 3 miles, climbing and an hr spinning class
*I'm still a lil upset with my g-ma, but my mom tells me that she doesn't know I'm upset, therefore I should give it up.
*A 30-something guy friend asked me to a movie. Creeped out? Yea. (he has a like 14+ yr old son) GAH
*I need some advice on what I should say to him to let him down easy and him still be a friend. 
*I need some advice on what I should say to this guy I'm totally diggin'. I'm no good at asking them out, but apparently I do a good job at getting attention from guys (says a few close friends *coughwhitcough*, the 30+ guy and like all the guys at the keg party. Course most of the guys were shit-faced and I was the only new girl in the group, so they don't count as much ;p)
*I have drills next next wknd so I'm getting ready for that (6 Drill SGT's!!! GAH! Pray for me lol)

Ok I think that's all...  hehe ttyl

I got it done at Santa Rosa Tattoo, which was totally great. The guy rocked, he was so nice. He talked a lot which helped not to focus on the needle. 

I also attended my first drill in Dublin. That was a blast. Ok maybe not the part where they yelled at me and woke me up at 330 am and then run a mile. But other than that, it was a blast. I still can't wait for basic.

I'm most likely getting a tattoo tomorrow, my mom knows and likes it, my dad doesn't and I'm seriously hoping he wont find out in the near future.. you know.... till I'm like... 25. That would be good. lol

I don't know how I'm getting down to San Francisco tomorrow, I thought I was getting a ride, but there's so many people going it's pretty confusing. Oh well, I'll figure it out. 

I'm going on a two week trip with my unit in October hopefully. One of the recruiters has to find out if I'm allowed to go cuz I haven't been to basic yet. They think it's ok, cuz I've sworn in and everything, but we have to double check before I'm issued any more clothing. Fun fun.

I've semi joined a paint ball team. Have I ever played? Nope. Have I ever watched a game go? Nope. Have I seen the bruises left by the guns? Yea. Woot I'm excited. The semi part comes in because we don't know how many people are interested so we have a few, but if it's not enough to make a team.. yadda yadda yadda.

My grandma has flown in for a few weeks. Yay, Japanese food.

I have the numbers for my Physical exam in February. 
Sit ups: 78
Push ups: 42
2 Mile run: 15 min 36 sec.

I have to make those... whew, I have my work cut out for me. 

I feel like I'm like boring people with my Army-ness, but that's all I'm doing now. So if it bothers you.. too bad. lol.

Uh.. yea I was like ok why do we need three? but then I realized that they all stopped by our table to stare at me. None of them like waited on my family, just me. Bleh. One guy like leaned against a wall and stared at me while playing with a napkin.. eewww. Kinda creepy. Omg that made me want like either want a boyfriend just so he could beat the shit out of them all and kinda wanted to run out of the restaurant JUST so they couldn't stare at me if I left. 

Hearst Castle was FABULOUS!!! OMG! but yea, there was a ton of walking. Four floors, we saw the whole enchilada, you can imagine how many stairs we walked up and down. whew. 

The last day we went to Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. Oober fun!!... well, after we found parking (took like 2 hours to get there), and we got our stuff.. (my dad wouldn't let us into our suitcases, so we had to buy shorts and stuff there), we were set to go. We hung out on the beach, Zack swallowed too much sea water, saw a seal in the waves, and got those wonderful garlic fries. Ry tried ""the new snack"" (aka fried Twinkies) and he said it was pretty good. EWWW No way is that any good. But I dont like twinkies to begin with, so it's not like that's a loss or anything for me. lol

Ok that's all. OoOoOooo I got my fatigues, and lemme know if ya wanna see me all decked out and I'll email it to ya (cuz I'm so not computer savvy I dunno how to post pics on this thingamajig)

I also went to the armory to get my camo's but they hadn't come in, and some came a bit small. So I'm going to Travis to exchange my boots this weekend.

I'm also going to Marine World.. fun fun.

OMG I wanna fly one so bad. Most of you know my obsession with fighters and I can't help but stare when I see them. One like took off and looped all over the place. Very cool, it took us a good twenty minutes to get to the car. I would hear the engine, stop, watch and walk again..and repeat. lol 

I can't wait till I get my license to fly one of those bad boys! 

Let's see... I saw one of my CO's and my sponsor (the soldier I call if I have q's) at one of the many booths. Fun fun, my sponsor reved up a HUMMV for them (my future car :D) while I talked to my CO about my uniform and that creepy guy that kept calling me. My family had a blast in the HUMMV, my brother was pretty stoked about that. He was like it's so loud when the door closes!! lol good times.

So many planes, so little time. I stopped at all the different planes, jets, and military booths. One guy from the Army was going to give me a hard time for wearing a NG shirt--but then I told him I was part of the NG, so he stopped like halfway thru a mini insult towards us. lol. He was like ""what does your shirt say?"" I was like (w/o looking) ""The Army National Guard."" ""Are you part of the National Guard?"" (insert Drill Sgt glare here) ""I am."" ""...Oh, well, heh here's a pencil for you to write your last name."" ""umm ok""

Anywho.. I gotta split, I have to run some errands for the 'rents. Later

I went to my spinning class yesterday. This was the first time we'd done anything so, needless to say, I'm a bit sore. After that I headed to Whit's to hang with her and Lissa. the three of us went to get Kitty and Matt but ended up ditching the kidnapping Matt idea, cuz Kev was a lil .. grrr. Anywho, we kidnapped Tim instead and we all went to play Pool at 123 Billiards. Lissa, Tim and myself played against Whit and Kitty. They beat us 2 out of 3 games but we got them in the last game. That was soo much fun watching everyone mess up (including myself, excluding Kitty cuz she's so darn good). 

When I got home around midnight, my dad was like ""geez it's about time"". I was surprised he was still up. The garage door probably woke him up. lol. 

This morning I went to IHOP with Em, Rini, Shauna, Rose, Bennett, and one of Rini's friends. That was fun, it was like a goodbye to Rini for all the people who aren't going to In N Out tonight (at 8- BE THERE!!! lol) to chill and have a good time. 

I hope to see lots of people at In N Out it's going to be oober fun!

"event","lol ok so I had spanish, flying, and cycling (which was canceled due to teacher sick-ness). I ran into Keelin and Maryann at the JC. Cool beans, they're both doing good, I thought I'd share. 

I later picked up Moli and Rini and we went to go see Harold and Kumar go to White Castle (my second time) for our last group thing with Mary.We met up with her and Jamie and Jordan. Fun fun!!

 Awww... Hanananananananananananananan it's gunna be weird with you so far away. :(

Afterwards, we decided to kidnap Mary and take her to In and Out Burger for ""our white castle mission"" but as soon as I pulled out of the parking garage, who was outside the theater? None other than Mary's mom.  Major bummer. The 5 of us met back up at the In and Out and chilled for 2 or so hrs. 

Ok that's all. I have class in the wee hours of the mornin'. I'll catch ya'll laterz

Love Always,

"event","Last night I went to Whit's for a semi girls night out. four girls one guy. We still managed to pull off watching a chick flick. 13 going on 30 is oober cute. Whit was trying to get us to watch Momento but with minor difficulties, we couldn't watch it. 's ok, next time.  I took Rini home around 12:30, my dad was all grr when I got home. Parents should not be allowed to talk when they just roll out of bed. It doesn't make sense, it's jumbled, then I question it and he gets even more grr. lol.

Jamming to Limp Bizkit on the way home was great. 

Saturday was REALLY fun. The fam and I took a day just for San Francisco. I swear, you can't see all of SF in one day. We went to the Wax Museum, the Aquarium by the Bay, the Hard Rock Cafe for lunch. But my biggest and happiest moment was when I saw the last standing Liberty Ship docked up. We took a tour of the massive ship, and then another tour of a submarine. Both used during WWII and had a lot of history to them. I had a ball, I'm not so sure my parents were as excited as I was. To make up for the tours, we ventured into this place that had all the old school coin machines, complete with the wrestler you arm wrestle with. rofllll I'm so weak, I had to use both arms for me to attempt to win. It was on the lowest possible level. 

Friday I was an extra in the Legend Of Dirk. Our job was to yell, throw eggs and tomatoes, scream and faint. Basically we were groupies for Dirk. lol I liked the egg throwing, and the dancing hehe. Jim saw me and was like ""Sarah, get your military ass over here"" and that has stuck with me, thanks to Justin. I have a feeling he'll be using that ore then the last nickname he gave me. hehe

Ok that's all for now. I have class in an hr. I gotta boogy.

"event","Ok yesterday was a total blast. I took my first flying lesson and then went to see Keith Urban!! Woot!

Flying was soo great! I didn't think I'd actually go up in a plane, let alone the instructor allowing me to take total control and fly for a bit. That was nifty. The lesson was 2 hrs, and I can't wait to get back in the air. Yay

Keith Urban was soo great. Cunningham, my dad, brother and myself went to see him (6th row) at the LBC. He is such a fab performer.... and we were sooo close!! I don't think it could have been any better if he tried. Ok maybe if we got to talk to him, but other than that.....  :p

Ok that's all. hehe.

"event","OK, even though my unit doesn't read my LJ, I need to get this off my chest as a way for me to get this out in the open and help me move on. Most of you know how quickly I get attached to people, especially those who really put themselves out there and go out of their way to make me and the people around them feel comfortable.

The majority of my unit is leaving for active duty in the US and outside. The closest guys there that have made me feel so at home are leaving or already have left. Jarrad's leaving for 15 months, Tinkler 18, Larson for 15 and Nichols is in the process of going  somewhere for a while then he'll be back then off again I do believe. 

I bid them and the rest of my unit farewell and a safe return for all of them. I can't wait for them to come back. 

Sadly, I'll probably be on my active duty when they get back. You read that right. I'm going on active duty right after I get out of my nursing school in Texas. I'll be back next August (I'm leaving Feb if you don't know) and then get the details on where I'm going and for how long.

"event","Ok as you've probably already read from other journals, Rini, Whitney, Shauna, Megan, Rose, Alex, Jenny and her friend Lili and myself all went to the lake today. Rose, Megan and I played volleyball vs. Alex all by his lonesome. He still kicked our butts in the beginning though, 20-18. Then Jenny took us out on her boat to go tubing. LMAO I caught some phat air on the last stretch. That was a ball. Whit and I went together, then me, then her, then Jenny. Lili didn't do it, but later on the four of us went swimming. 

Logs were oober fun!! I caught a fish with my hands, that was cool. Rini and I decided that we need oars to play American Gladiators with the Q-tip fighting. lol. 

We got lost on the way home... no thanks to my wonderful co-pilots... lmao j/k j/k. I drove alllllllllllllll over the place today. Good practice but I have a new found respect for taxi drivers and chauffeurs. hehe 

OK I'm sooooooo tired, and am thinking about taking a nap but I'm probably not going to. :p

Love Always,

That's great.. all five Backstreet boys. I can't believe I used to love them.
I went to the fair with my family. The first time was better cuz I went with Chan, her friend Robin, Whit and her sister Em. I had a blast. This time was fun but we had to stay in the little kiddy area for my brother so he could go on rides and stuff. The one ride I was stoked about going on like malfunctioned before it started and like the whole time I thought I was gunna fall out and die. It was that big green one... I forget what it's called but you like sit in it and they strap you in with that chest harness and that metal rod and you get spun around in circles and shit. Anyways... my mom and I went on that and like before anything happened the harnesses came down, and the metal rod lowered then it like sprung back up. That wouldn't have bothered me so much if the ride didn't start to like move. Then the harnesses came up and the ride was still shaking. I was kinda confused/ freaked out. The guy had to put the harnesses back over us and the rod down manually. The ride went and like the first part of it, you get lifted up so you're like perpendicular with the ground and my harness like clicked. My mom's too I later found out. I couldn't enjoy it, I was too freaked out. Never again am I going on that... no way.

But on a happier note, at the fair my brother won bank at the races. That was pretty cool. He won 4 races in a row. I've never seen anyone do that before so that was a treat.

Love Always,

"event","1.) I got my hair colored, streaked, and cut. The color: red. The streaks: blond. The cut: umm, lets just say I can fit all of my hair under a baseball cap successfully and barely any sticks out. It's shorter than I'm used to, that's for sure.

2.) More NG stuff, but I have a feeling the more I talk about it, the more people realize that I'm in this for the long haul and begin to waver on how they feel about my joining. Go ahead and speak your peace, but just to let you know, anything negative you  say isn't going to change my opinion about it. I've heard it all, believe me.

3.) I'm sick and tired of doing practically nothing all summer. Since I quit, I haven't been too successful finding another job. If y'all wanna do something, gimme a call.

"event","That subject is what the damn test looked like. 126 questions .. of that. Totally random, no way to decipher what exactly it means. Ok, there was like a picture and a funky word under it, but the questions were like that. I sure did have a ball with that. Uhh, no. My brain hurts. Your's would too after an hour and a half of that. 

Afterwords, Private Negherbon and I hung out and had lunch with one of his friends. Fun fun. Lol this is how slow I can be (sometimes), we were in Sunnyvale, where lived for a big ol' chunk of my life and I didn't realize it till I saw the main road like almost 2 hours later.

Ok that's all for now.

"event","I've been up for an hour now getting ready to go. I thought it would take me two, but, it obviously did not. So now I have an hour to kill before going to my test in San Jose. Great. You know I coulda spent this time sleeping! Oh well. I'm over it. I should probably get used to it anyways, God only knows how early I'll be waking up at boot camp. 

It's weird and kinda creepy how I'm the only one awake at this hour in my house. I mean, ok I knew that was going to happen, but for those of you that's seen my gigantic sized house (or have a big ol' house of your own), it's kinda freaky hearing the house settling and you still jump even though you know what it was. 

Well, now that I'm officially awake now, I think it's safe to say that my bad day was brought on me by Karma. After the phone call I just figured I'd have a bad and Voila! bad Karma. Plus my Karma had it coming when I told the councilor I did something.. when I actually didn't so that equaled out to my parking ticket. That's gotta be true because I've never seen a security guard roaming the parking lots at the JC! 

So, needing all the good Karma I can get to pass this test (which I'm kinda freaked out about and kinda not), I shall think good thoughts.... like this fab book I'm reading. It's called Pilots, and it's by James Spencer. He talks about his experiences as a WWII bomber pilot. I've just started, but it has that ""hook"" as Ms. Lehman would say. :)

What this test entails exactly is... hmm... *yawn* They're just testing my brain to see if it can handle another language. I should be fine, considering I took french for like 2 years and spanish for a 1/2. I dunno. The next test they're giving me is on Friday is going to be a little weird I've heard. They want to see how well I can come up with a logical sentence using a different language and some key words they've translated. I'm actually looking forward to that one lol. 

Ok, y'all can call me crazy if you want cuz frankly if I heard this from someone else   I'd think so too. But, I'm actually looking forward to boot camp. I don't think there'll be a problem for me with the yelling and stuff, my brothers yell at me enough as is. And I wanna get all decked out in my fatigues and go crawling through the mud. I'm such a tom boy. *sigh* 

Alrighty tighty, I've used up a chunk of time doing this, while all of you are soundly sleeping in your nice warm beds... damn you all.

"event","My birth father called me today. He hasn't called in over a year and a half. Then as if the phone call alone wouldn't kill me, he has the nerve to ask why my sister and I are so ""distant"" to him. Umm, I didn't wanna tell him that every memory of him is bad, that  he's a complete jack ass, and shouldn't be allowed to label himself as father. 

So with that done, I cried, got over it, and formulated a plan to get him out of my life... forever. 

Next thing on my list was to take a placement test at the JC. I show up at 2:02, the test began at 2:00. The proctor wouldn't let me stay because of my lateness. Damn. So I went to see the councilor, who said basically to get over myself, cuz it's college and you have to be punctual. Damn, another thing I have to work on. So after my mini meeting with him (he had that speak your peace or get out of my office vibe) I went out to my car. As soon as I was in view of my car there was a bright neon green envelope on the windshield. I parked in the wrong area, and my JC parking sticker had expired so I was slapped with a $25 fee for the 15 minutes I was in the office. Grr. 

After that it was alright. There was a guy with an Australian accent in the office so not all was lost. Plus I went to the mall with Whitney. fun fun.


Tomorrow however should be more pleasant, minus the 4:30 wake up call to take a test at 6 in the morning. But once I get my test out of the way it'll be smooth sailing.

"event","I feel like I should apologize in advance if I'm a little moody to you guys. I just recieved some uneasy information earlier today. Turns out, one of the sergeants that is  currently mentoring me for the National Guard is going to Iraq in a few days time. Some of you already know this, and sadly that is not the unsettling news. The unsettling part is the location in Iraq. Apparently he's going to be right in the middle of the fighting. He'll be there between a year and 18 months. The only good thing about this (if you can even call it good news) is that his platoon is relieving another group that will come home. I'm worried about them, which is to be expected, and I pray that they all come back home safely. 

I just hope that you all can bare with me on this. If I'm grr, I apologize. If I'm any other way than my normal bubbly self, I apologize.

Yesterday I went shopping and like it was so great cuz at the Coddingtown mall, ALL the stores had a sale. That was exciting. I got mucho jeans, some accessories and a pink knit poncho. I love it. yay. Shopping is good. Shopping is also very therapeutic. No lie. 

I went to Best Buy in search of a dirt bike video for Roberts birthday, but alas they didn't have it. Neither did two other stores I went to. One guy I asked said that a lot of people call looking for those particular videos, but no one can find them. I'm like hello, you're a store, you get lots of calls asking for those videos, don't you think it'd be a good idea to stock them?!? Call me crazy but c'mon now. lol

One last thing: I talked to the Sgt's and I'm basically all set, I have a medical test on the 29th and then they'll swear me in! I'm stoked. They laid out everything like where I'm going to school, what I'll be studying and so on. It's great. I'm going to a school, get free board, classes are paid for, plus they're giving me an allowance. Sweet deal. All I have to do to get all that and then some is.... boot camp. But hey, it's only 6 weeks. *shrug* No biggie.

That's about it for today.  

Tomorrow: Rose's party! Woot

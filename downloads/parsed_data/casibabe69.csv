God saw that she was getting tired,
And a recovery was not to be.
So he put His arms around her
And whispered, ""Come home with me.""
With tearful eyes, we watched her suffer
And saw her fade away.
Although we loved her dearly,
We could not make her stay.
A golden heart stopped beating:
A determined spirit is at rest.
God broke our hearts to prove to us
He only takes the best."

"event","I like having pets. I have had dogs since I was five - well up till I moved to the city anyway. After that there was a pet-less six years due to the fact I had no fixed lodgings, followed by the fact that I live alone and I hardly spend any time at home. Of course in those years, I had housemates who had pets, a rather old shaggy orange hamster whom I nicknamed Hamtaro (whom I ended up taking care of in my housemate's absence) and a tank of fish (that also ended up my responsibility in her absence). 

When I did eventually have my own place I always wanted a dog but it didn't seem like a good idea to leave a dog alone in the house for 12 hours a day. I could imagine coming home to happy tail wagging in a background of chaos and &quot;landmines&quot;. Eventually I did get a fish in a bowl but there didn't seem much amusement in that aside from the fact that they don't usually don't live long.

And then I considered getting a cat - but the fact their poop are probably the most hazardous things next to anthrax did not appeal to me. And cat hairs are likely to give me fits. My mom also does not like cats - she's fine with them, as long as they don't live with her. I also did not appreciate that cats often appear nonchalant towards their owners. One queen in the house was quite enough. Last week, I did the unthinkable. I did not do it on an impulse because I thought about it for at least two months. It is undeniable though that I was reckless with my considerations. Maybe I just wanted to be less analytical for once and take a risk. So now here I am saddled down by a pair of rabbits. 

Buyer's remorse, I definitely have it. Mostly from the fact that they poop and pee with such frequency that I have to clear out the hutch at least twice a day. Other than that, I find them a source of amusement. For one thing, they seem to know where to do their business: at the litter tray. Their curious nature seem to test my patience and tickle me at the same time. I almost ended up squashing one of them yesterday when I decided to lie down on the floor last night to watch TV. The rascal decided it was worth investigating when it saw me sit down on the floor. Not to mention during their hours out of the hutch, I can't take my eyes off them. Wires and carpets seem fair game to them when it comes to chewing. Every few minutes I have to check underneath the sofa to make sure they are not up to mischief. And why didn't anyone mention that rabbits have horrible sharp claws? My mom is going to have a field day the next time she comes over."

It freaked the crap out of me and I loved it. None of those Resident Evil cheap scare and gore tactics for me please. Silent Hill was the type of game that will leave you spooked enough to want to keep your bedroom door locked at night long after you played the game. When Silent Hill 4: The Room came out after a long wait, I was much elated to finally be able to play the game. Then I was much disappointed at the rather no-brainer plot and drastic control changes which seem to be only loosely connected to Silent Hill. So I was thinking, after all the wrong they done to the series in SH4, they would at least have bothered to redeem themselves in the next installment, Silent Hill: Homecoming (SH5). WRONG! Nevermind they'd only released Silent Hill: 0rigins for PSP, which left me much pissed, but SH5 turned out to be quite an angry disappointment.<br /><br />OK maybe I have no right to complain since I resorted to downloading the PC version which took me hours to troubleshoot and then eventually, me buying the pirated version which also had the same bugs as the downloaded version. So again, nevermind. Bottomline was I managed to get the game to work: clever me. Firstly, I was much pleased that the graphic have obviously went through a major improvement since the last installment. But that's where the good things end, no thanks to Konami switching over production from Team Silent to Foundation 9 Entertainment and Double Helix in the US. Leave it to the Americans to spoil the game. For some reason they seem to think more monsters mean better gameplay. When will they ever learn that they should leave horror to the Japanese? There are so many monsters swarming every setting, that their mis-happened nightmarish appearances ceases to scare you but become annoying obstacles. And as if that wasn't enough, they seem to possess some kind of fatality move that if you don't mash your mouse fast enough(which is usually the case considering how difficult it is to maneuver with a mouse and keyboard), leaves you dead without being able to even put up a fight. And believe me, dying 5 times in a row on the same setting just leaves you exasperated rather than wishing to continue. Considering I have always loved the way the series allows you to explore and figure out creative ways to get around, the throngs of monsters swarming you like bitches in heat just makes that impossible.<br /><br />And that's not all I want to rant about. I mean, what kind of dumb plot is it anyway that SH5 has? It's like they couldn't decide to go with an independent psychological horror which is what SH2 was or that they should stick with the often vague cultish connections first introduced in SH1. In the end, they ended up with yet another SH4-like storyline with thin plots, loosely tied with Silent Hill. If it is not because I procured the game through, ahem, &quot;unofficial&quot; means, I would be throwing up a ruckus in demanding my money back for this poor excuse of a continuance in the Silent Hill franchise. If Konami has any intention in keeping the series alive, they would have the next installment done by Team Silent again. Americans... MEH!"

"event","If anyone has been reading the New Straits Times today, you will be coming across the headlines &quot;Are you doing this to your child?&quot; with an cheapskate clip-art silhouette of a child and hastily montaged images of &quot;violent video games&quot; forming the child's brain. What is being implied of course is that video games are the source of violence and aggression in today's young. Hell, they are not really implying, but making outright claims that this is INDEED so. <br /><br />I used to be an avid fan of video games, especially in my teenage years and early adulthood. I have many fond memories of running all-nighters to finish Diablo I and Dungeon Keeper. So I find these accusations that video games are the main cause of violent behaviour in the young ridiculous, even if there are scientific studies to prove that it might be so. I have randomly shot, bludgeoned and blown up things in games like Quake, Blood, Silent Hill and Resident Evil, but I think I grew up fine, if you discount the fact I am gay. Call it disturbing, but I laughed till I was in stitches while playing one of Quake III's free for all &quot;fragging&quot; modes online. My user handle: Sister Mary Jones. But no, I have never acted out any violent behaviours despite my penchant for violent video games. <br /><br />Sure, granted, the random thought of wanting to decapitate some offending moron does come occasionally to my head but I think the more important thing here is the ability to make choices. And that, most of society would agree is what puts us above other living creatures. What impairs one's ability to make a simple choice of not acting like the <a href=""http://elliotmcbeal.blogspot.com/2007/04/jack-ass.html"">jackass</a> in the Virgina Tech shootings is plain ignorance. Maybe in his case, it was just evolution running its course in rooting out dead ends, unfortunate as it is for the rest who ended up as collateral damage. And I don't think those retards who sexually assault their own children and sisters got their inspiration from video games either. <br /><br />So please, the next time your child acts like a loser, don't blame it on the video games. Start asking yourself whether you are bringing up your kid the right way instead. It's not the fault of the video games for doing the parenting instead of YOU."

It looked familiar because it looked somewhat like my house but I knew it wasn't mine but I somehow knew it belonged to a friend of mine. My friend's mom and another friend was cleaning a room, and I knew there were drugs in it. Somehow I just couldn't be bothered and I just lay there on the couch reading.<br /><br />*Missing memory*<br /><br />Somehow, friend's mom had not come across the drugs, because the other friend had hidden it.

Drowning guy denied he was drowning and claims he was a diving instructor. Schoolmate and I leave, with me feeling much disgusted that he didn't even appear thankful. Schoolmate is sympathetic and decides we should go KFC so we did. Except KFC did not look like any regular KFC. It had a lot of funny stuff there which doesn't appear on the real world menu though I can no longer recall what it was. I just recalled I wanted the ordinary snack plate but the queue was long.<br /><br />*Missing memory*<br /><br />I was back at friend's place, where the drugs were. Friend turns out to be <a href=""http://antithesis2.net/index.php"">Laynie</a>.

"event","It's one of those days, when I want to blog but yet I can't bring myself to do it because my head is full of disjointed and incoherent thoughts. I can't focus on one topic and elaborate on it. Then I thought, who the hell cares because it's MY blog, so screw coherency. In the words of a former blog I used to visit almost religiously - but enough about you. ME. ME. ME. ME. Oh look, still me. Damn it, if you're reading this, please start blogging again.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ants</span><br /><br />Ants share a common ancestor with wasps and bees. They are the ultimate feminist's dream. A whole colony of females where males only function as a necessity to procreate. They are rather industrious and hardy little creatures, toiling day and night. All in the name of their queen. And they are everywhere in my home - my bathroom, my kitchen, my desk, my bedroom. Christ, what are they invading me for? My flat is so devoid of food, you would think it's Ethiopia... or maybe North Korea. They seem to avoid the ant bait, and insecticide is just as good as America's promise of hunting down Osama bin Laden. The funny thing is, they seem periodic. Occasionally they would vanish for a month or two, and they will be back again in full force. But meanwhile, I have to bear with their annoying presence. Did I mention they seem to have a taste for mouthwash? <br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Status</span><br /><br />Facebook's user status is fun. I don't care what the hell some bitter sociopath have to say about it. It's fun. FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN!!! Alright, fine - it helps pass time in a company where instant messaging programs are blocked. If that doesn't sound incredulous, it gets un-blocked at exactly 12pm to 2pm and then from 5pm to 9am the next day. It's like as if they are control feeding their employees. It's 2pm, time for your daily dose of online communication. Eat up my little guinea pigs! The ridiculous thing is, the analysts have free reign over usage of instant messaging programs, supposedly to &quot;communicate with the clients&quot;. In any case, I have been here for 2 years and the pressure to move on is growing, especially when the company seem to have changed their business direction and left their designers out of their plans. Now all we seem to be good for in the office is just shifting stuff around. Four years in university and degree worth RM60,000 and I end up a coolie. Fuck my life. And thank you Captain Najib Obvious for finally admitting the economy is screwed, therefore making the chances for brighter opportunities elsewhere slimmer.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Age</span><br /><br />It seems I am not the only one feeling the death throes of youth. An ex-classmate laments how scary it is that he is nearing 30 while he reminisces how it didn't seem so long ago that we were back in school crazy about console games. Another groans that we didn't used to have to worry about things like sustaining a job and finances. An Indian ex-schoolmate (with a overbearing personality and potty mouth and yes I am adding these because I don't like her and also because it's all true) whines how it seem like yesterday that she was still 16. What does she have to complain about, she's just 27. Not taking lightly the humour of me charting her life from being a swamped mother of teenagers to old wrinkly hag, she asked me if my life was that miserable. I am gay and hating it, no longer young, still single because all gay men are too fucked up to maintain a relationship, stuck with a dead end job but still having to be thankful to have one due to the economy, closeted because mummy dearest would be suicidal if she knows and I live alone because I can't even find the time to have pets. She (Indian ex-schoolmate) is lucky I don't drug her and hack her legs off like Kathy Bates in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Misery</span>."

Apparently after all the renovation at Bangsar Shopping Centre, the management just did not include the theatre in its plans. Though founders Datuk Faridah Merican and Joe Hasham have said they will be looking for a new place, nothing much is solid yet. They still have their branch over at Penang, but it will rather be a great pity if they're not continuing here. One can still remember the anguish when the flood a few years back pretty much wrecked Actor's Studio main headquarters over at Dayabumi which in turn gave the branch at Bangsar much more prominence. Of course, there are still other venues of performing arts which are gaining popularity nowadays like KLPAC and the Istana Budaya, but it just wouldn't be same without Actor's Studio. Let's pray they will continue on.</div>"

"event","I am not usually politically inclined other than just making passing comments about current political issues. However like most of the younger generation, I do have a rebel streak so I pretty much hold the ruling government in contempt. Whatever the case I am never too fussy about who is at the top as long as they are doing the job they are suppose to do. As much disdain as I have for the ruling coalition, I have much respect for our ex-PM Tun Dr. Mahathir. He might not have been a leader who plays fair, but at least he WAS a leader, much unlike the constantly half-asleep Abdullah... <br /><br />The recent fiasco in my home state of Perak does not really affect me much, though I would still rather see the Pakatan Rakyat in control. And like recent polls, the underhanded grab for power did not go down well with me. Though I did not like the fact that the much beloved Sultan Azlan Shah did not dissolve the state assembly (which would have been the most fair thing to do), I do believe in his wisdom it would have been the less problematic decision to acknowledge that PR had indeed lost its majority and should make way for BN. After all, didn't PR itself supported the notion of taking over the federal government via the defection tactic a few months back? Funny how when the tables are turned, we see a different face on both parties. So someone please tell me if my notion that there is no one worth voting for in the elections was wrong when we have a bunch of hypocrites as candidates.<br /><br />What irks me however is the recent backlash that came from PR's action of wanting to sue the Malay ruler over his decision to acknowledge the new state government. Let's not forget, that it was Dr. M's, (a Malay man) actions in the past that removed the Malay rulers' immunity to the law. So what's the fuss if someone indeed decides to sue one of them? Don't get me wrong, because I have much pride in our country's unique royal heritage. Though in all logic, I believe it is nothing more than a cultural thing. It is rather sad to see, that in this day and age, when we are now finally witnessing a black man become the president of the United States, that our country's politics are still divided by racial lines. Sue a Sultan, and all a sudden it becomes a challenge to Malay rights. Frankly, I doubt the ruckus that is being raised has anything to do with their love for the Malay rulers. It is just another excuse to remind the minorities of the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ketuanan Melayu</span>.<br /><br />Every politician in power wants to harp about racial integration and harmony, but speak up about racial inequality and we have the issue above hit the fan. Our country's politics are undoubtedly ruled along lopsided racial lines, we just can't say it out loud, because we run the risk of questioning the &quot;Malay rights&quot; and therefore branded a racist and inciter. For goodness sake, after the last general elections we could not even accept a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Menteri Besar</span> from a minority race in a state where Malays are the majority. Does it really matter? The role of a leader is for the betterment of the people, so Malay or not should not be an issue, neither should it be a challenge to the national religion. No one is suppressing anyone's rights to worship here. Who cares what is the race or religion of a man or woman at the top post as long as he/she does the job well? <br /><br />If I have ever voiced my support for the opposition, it is only because it seemed the lesser of two evils. At least DAP and PKR appeared more likely to end the racial divisions. No comment though, on PAS. We have wasted enough years with BN's other component parties' lack of vision and submission to UMNO's arrogance and ego. Any wonder why BN lost significant support from the people? Times are changing and despite already almost a year since the elections, BN still appears to be holding on to its archaic standards with nothing to show from its many promises to change. Even the more educated of Malay folks are feeling the less for the need to be coddled. I have no bones to pick with my Malay brothers and sisters, just the point of view that one race should be above all the rest does not sit well with me. I wonder if I will ever live to see a prime minister from a minority race. Then again, who can say?"

"event","There are worse things that could happen to someone on any fine day in the world.&nbsp;Like for instance, a bomb could land right on top of your home and obliterate your entire family while leaving you the maimed sole survivor, or maybe some crazy terrorist decides to send a plane right into your office building. But that's not really the point of this entry. I want to illustrate just how bad things can turn bad on you on any ordinary day.<br /><br />1. You wake up late.<br /><br />2. You go to get your breakfast at the nearby coffeeshop, and the people there decide to take their own sweet time to attend to your order.<br /><br />3. The first signs of annoyance begin when the slow moving vehicles decides to hog the right lane and the left lane is full of slow rumbling trucks.<br /><br />4. Some bright spark decided it was a good idea to have the Le Tour de Whatever route run through one of the deadliest traffic snarls of rush hour, the dreaded Lebuhraya (or Parking) Damansara - Puchong. It induces a virtual standstill through 3/4 of the entire length of the highway and spilling the mess into several connected routes.<br /><br />5. It's everybody for themselves. Everyone has somewhere to get to on time, so hell, let's squeeze into whatever lane gets you there faster. Does anyone in the Klang Valley not realise it only slows down traffic even more? Cars start to scrape against each other, cars stop, and drivers argue about who bumped whose butt at the expense of further aggravating the jam.<br /><br />6. Halfway through the stop and go traffic, you get a stomachache. The kind that probably is a man's closest equivalent to childbirth.<br /><br />7. You finally get to a shortcut, only to have all the traffic lights (numbering about 10) along the route turn red at your turn, all the while trying your best not to empty your bowels on the carseat. <br /><br />6. About 500 meters from your office, someone's car decides to breakdown, delaying you from your destination another further 10 minutes.<br /><br />7. You finally arrive at your office building.&nbsp;You enter the carpark and a really 'considerate' person decides to hog the lane while he waits to take someone else's parking space despite the availability of many more and the other one takes his/her own sweet time to unlock, open the car door, step inside while arranging his/her belongings, check himself/herself in the mirror, buckle up, start the car, and then move out slowly while making sure he/she does not disturb the surrounding air.<br /><br />8. Great, you finally manage to park and you have so far successfully not soiled your pants yet. You grab your bag, head for the elevator and find both are at the top floor.<br /><br />9. The elevator finally arrives, and you get inside, all the while praying to whatever God or Supreme Being it is you believe in that it would just go all the way up without stopping. No such luck. It stops at the next floor and you find two people with a trolley talking with each other and not realising the elevator has arrived despite the loud chime.

For two months, I did not really bothered about it. Now I assumed it was untouched as it looked unopened. Three days ago I finally got around to it after feeling an itch to munch. To my horror, I found that the bag was opened. The contents exposed to the elements of my kitchen all this time.<br /><br />And then curiosity got the best of me. I picked a piece from the bag and inspected it. No mold, no sign of a household pest infestation. Slowly, I drew the pretzel close to my mouth and I took a sniff. No offending odour. Then almost an afterthought, I popped it gingerly into my mouth and took a bite.<br /><br />Two days later, I finished the whole bag. All 10 ounce of it. <br /><br />"

"event","I hardly ever buy DVDs nowadays, mostly because <lj user=""equalmusic"">&nbsp;dumps a portion of his cache on me once he's done watching them. Unfortunately after a year of doing so, he has yet to have a lot of hits as to guessing what type of movies are to my liking. So it was on one of those rare occasions yesterday that I decided to pay a visit to the neighbourhood DVD pirate which has a lot of titles to satisfy the finicky person like me. As most Malaysians are familiar with, DVD pirates are mostly a stereotypical lot. The Chinese <em>lala beng</em> types who used to rule&nbsp;Chinatown (which now resembles Banglatown more). Being the fact that the joint is new, the proprietor was very much friendly to any visitor who drops by. A little too friendly perhaps. At first he tried recommending titles to me. Me, being me however, usually do not appreciate being constantly harrassed while perusing though I&nbsp;just nodded and smiled to humour the man. <br /><br />Then he began to explain to me his promotions, of how I&nbsp;can mix and match different sorts of DVDs in his shop and get one free if I&nbsp;buy five titles.&nbsp;He sneakily lead me to a section where softcore porn were among the mix, then he said in a coy tone that he had more hardcore ones in the room at the back and that he can recommend me some titles if I needed. I flustered and waved him away while trying to distract him by showing more interest in his Star Trek:&nbsp;Voyager boxed set (&nbsp;I&nbsp;REALLY WAS INTERESTED&nbsp;IN&nbsp;THAT, OK?!). Not to be perturbed, he insisted and lead me to his secret stash. I&nbsp;had to humour him for a while browsing through various heterosexual hardcore porn while trying my best to feign interest in abnormally large bosoms and penis-chomping vaginas, though in reality I was more interested in the stack with a naked man brazenly displaying his genitalia.<br /><br />&quot;Try these titles!&nbsp;Got story wan!&quot; he says (in Cantonese of course).<br /><br />He left me alone after a while much to my relief, though I&nbsp;still had to pretend to browse through more titties and vaginas for fear he might be observing me through some secret hidden camera to find out my &quot;consumer habits&quot;. I left the room unobtrusively as possible to avoid his attention, but alas:<br /><br />&quot;Aiyah boss, nothing you like?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Er. No.&quot; I felt as if everyone in the shop was looking at me, &quot;I&nbsp;will just stick with your old movies thanks.&quot;<br /><br />I quickly shuffled back to the Blu-ray section and made my choice and quickly paid for them. But DVDman was not about to let me go without a fight.<br /><br />&quot;You don't have to worry, I will never bluff you!&nbsp;What I&nbsp;recommend to you is all clear wan... I&nbsp;still want to make sure you come back right??&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Right. That's what you DVD sellers say.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Aiya, don't say like that la... tell you what....&quot; he lowers his voice a notch, &quot;If you want to <em>kiu kai</em>, you let me know!&nbsp;I&nbsp;do this also!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;WHAT???!!! You do THAT as well??&quot; <br /><br />For those of you who don't know, <em>kiu kai</em> here is a crude way to say &quot;soliciting the services of a prostitute&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;Yaaa! All <em>Chung Guok mui</em> (Mainland Chinese girls), guaranteed pretty! I&nbsp;don't do all those Malay, Malay wan. You just let me know what you want, I&nbsp;arrange for you!&quot;<br /><br />Dear God, that was the straw that broke MY back. I walked as fast as I could from the place without breaking into a panic run, half wanting to throw my earlier purchase back at the offending pimp. I&nbsp;felt as if I&nbsp;had just made a donation supporting the flesh trade.&nbsp;I&nbsp;have no problems with piracy, but I&nbsp;draw the line at prostituion. One thing is for sure, no way I am going back THERE again.<br />"

I have read about it before, from the creator of one of my favourite TV series, Six Feet Under, Alan Ball. A series about vampires set two years after &quot;coming out of the coffin&quot; due to the invention of artificial blood. With no need to feed on humans anymore, vampires now live in the open. The premise, unfortunately resembles the recent stupid vampire movie, Twilight which had fan girls frothing and orgasming at the same time, a romance between a human and a vampire. The only difference is, under the creative direction of Alan Ball, True Blood becomes a masterful piece of storytelling, if you don't mind the often distracting graphic sex scenes and nudity. Hell, even the title sequence is crammed with 18SX rated visuals, so I think you wouldn't be seeing this on local TV anytime soon. But you can take some pointers from here Miss Meyer, that you don't need an over-the-top good looking vampire from your wet dreams to a hold a story. Seriously, sparkling vampires?<br /><br />I digress, the series is based on the Sookie Stackhouse book series by Charlaine Harris. That's right, the protagonist has the kooky name Sookie Stackhouse (played by Academy Award winner Anna Paquin), who happens to be a telepath. Due to her abilities she finds herself unable to have a normal relationship, which brings her close to a vampire named Bill Compton who walks into the bar where she works as a waitress one night. Bill who is undead has no brainwaves, which makes his thoughts silent to Sookie - a match made in Heaven. Though the awkward romance between the two takes centerstage in the series, what makes it move are the colourful supporting characters set in the fictional redneck Louisiana town, Bon Temps. Sookie's boss, Sam Merlotte, who also happens to harbour romantic feelings for her is a closet shape-shifter, her best friend, Tara Thornton is believed to be contaminated by demons, and her brother, Jason is a horny womanizer and spent most of the first few episodes with his clothes off in often graphically simulated sex scenes. I have only watched four episodes and I am already loving it. Unfortunately it is still in its first season. Oh well, there is always House MD and Grey's Anatomy to distract me in the wait. <br /><br />"

I think it added a nice warm touch to my home for the holiday season. However the aftermath remains unclear as I have yet to receive my credit card bill though I know exactly how much I owe the bank. But nothing sinks in reality more than the tangible proof of your overspending. I also now have enough angel tree toppers to last another three years if I should decide to change my tree theme. I am, however, not looking forward to the end of the twelfth day and the monumental task of dismantling the whole thing and putting it back into storage. Makes me glad they don't have Chinese New Year trees... <br /><br />"

"event","One of the dangers in meeting new people is how the conversation can sometimes take a turn for the worse. Like for instance how I&nbsp;(think) offended this particular person without knowing it. We were talking about group exercise programs in the gyms upon which the topic fell on tai chi. He was relating to me how in his youth he had bad asthma and how this so called &quot;master&quot; taught him some tai chi breathing and exercises which helped him a lot. He elaborated on how this master was of great reputation and don't take students easily, sort of like your stereotypical &quot;shi fu&quot; stock character (think Pai Mei in Kill Bill), and how he said that he's just going to show him once on some basic exercises once and after that he shouldn't bother him again. Now I wouldn't be so taken aback by the rather arrogant behaviour of this &quot;master&quot; but I&nbsp;would admit to being dumbfounded as to why this person who is relating to me this story be talking about him so reverently.

Call me lacking in tact, but I&nbsp;pounced on it immediately, asking him why the man had to behave in such a haughty manner when it comes to imparting his skill. He explained to me that the &quot;master&quot; had such knowledge in his hands that he had to be careful in choosing who to teach them to, as the knowledge he had can empower someone with the ability to kill with his bare hands. Now that to me is pure poppycock. What did it have to do with the master's arrogant holier-than-thou attitude? Correct me if I am wrong, but any knowledge is a dangerous thing depending on how you wield it. Like how a car is an instrument for transport, but put it in the hands of a drunk and you have a weapon of mass destruction. So to me, having a little knowledge in martial arts does not automatically grant you divine status to judge everyone else. You can either choose to impart your knowledge wisely or not at all, so all the haughty behaviour was rather unnecessary.&nbsp; 

I digress, this person did not take my point of view well at all. He then argued that he understood the master's opinion because being that he was a trainer of sorts as well, he believes one has to be stern when it comes to dealing with students as a way to build respect. But I&nbsp;countered, being stern was one thing, but behaving like you're a god when it comes to imparting knowledge is just uncalled for.&nbsp;I was reminded of the days when I was in high school where we had teachers of such who terrorized their students just because they were in a position of power. I bolstered the fact that I&nbsp;also trained people in my line of work and I&nbsp;understood the view of being stern, but I believed helping someone improve should be the basis of imparting a skill, not demonstrating your superiority to others. At this point, this person got exasperated and let slip that people like me should just &quot;go home&quot;. Usually I don't take last resort retorts like that lightly but I&nbsp;can see when someone has hit his boiling point. But really, let's not forget, despite what a great kungfu master Pai Mei was, his arrogance became his downfall. And what did he die of?&nbsp;Getting poisoned - now THAT, is killing with style and finesse. Killing with your bare hand, so crude and barbaric."

On a positive note, I&nbsp;loved Bolt. You've got to admit, it was cheesy, it was predictable and it was definitely designed to make you go &quot;Awwww...&quot; but hell, it's one of those movies that just makes you feel all melted and warm and fuzzy inside. Almost brought a tear to my eye... ALMOST. It sure beats Twilight, although very much a faithful adaptation of the book despite the compressed timelines. Both are crap, and Stephenie Meyer ought to be shot for unleashing this gruesome equivalent of a teenage girl's wet dream into the world.

"event","I thought that would be the end of it when I finally swore off spending more on the Christmas tree. Firstly, I have yet to stop visiting Christmas deco departments, mostly due to the fact that HRH is not around to smack me. However, I did not buy anything although my tree is still missing a topper which had me hunting in almost every major mall in the Klang Valley (other than the terribly secluded ones in Klang). The furthest I went would probably be the obscure Great Eastern Mall, located along Jalan Ampang, which is almost a good 45 minutes drive from where I stay, provided there is no bad traffic of course which is highly unlikely nowadays. They had some pretty ones which are unfortunately astronomically priced.

Secondly, I came out of my room one night into the living room to discover something was not quite right with my tree. It took me about 5 seconds to realise that the lower half of the tree was in darkness. Apparently the whole strand consisting of 100 lights had fried - which would mean I had to slowly extricate the mentioned section by removing all the ornaments. Fine, despite my annoyed disposition, I had to buy another strand of lights to replace the burnt out section (who the hell makes Christmas lights which fries the whole length?). To my annoyance, due to the rearranging, the tree now looks slightly unbalanced. To the lay person it would probably mean nothing, but the inner angsty artist in me screamed. Fine, nevermind, I thought, while I smothered the screaming angsty artist. Barely one hour later, the replaced section flickered and before my very eyes, the lower half of the tree was plunged into darkness again! 

&quot;Must... control... fist... of... death....&quot;

It took all my strength to control the welling rabid madness within me and not rush towards my overpriced tree and rip it to pieces with my bare hands. Post mortem discovery - my multi-socket plug proved to be the culprit. The loose connection had somehow resulted in a surge. Result - another strand of lights needed, which means yet another painstaking removal and replacement session. Did I mention how much I hate Christmas?"

"event","I&nbsp;have a love hate relationship with Christmas. It's the season that gets me down and it is also the season that invokes unwelcome feelings in me. The only thing I&nbsp;love about Christmas are the Christmas trees.&nbsp;I am even less enthusiastic about receiving Christmas presents as compared to setting up a tree. Don't ask me why, but I&nbsp;have a feeling it stems from some repressed childhood thing when we used to set up an artificial tree back in hometown every Christmas season though nobody in my family are Christians. I&nbsp;never really asked my mother why we did it despite us being a family of freethinkers and pagan idol worshipers. I theorized it was really just for the sake of us kids. The &quot;tradition&quot; stopped after we started having dogs. According to my mother, she didn't want to have dog fur getting caught up in the tree though I suspected it was more because she didn't want the hassle of extracting the tree from our hazardously overloaded storeroom. 

After a few years of living in the city alone and watching over the top and extravagant trees being set up in malls during Christmas season (I blame Metrojaya for the bulk of my obsession), I&nbsp;finally caved in last year and hastily bought a 5 feet tree from Tesco which I haphazardly cobbled together with budget trimmings in a vain attempt to make it look expensive. The end result was disastrous. Not so much because it ended up looking cheap and pathetic, but because it fueled by obsession that I needed to do better next year. My mother did not over-reacted as I thought she would when she popped by for a visit:

&quot;A Christmas tree?&nbsp;You should have just asked for the old one at home if you wanted one instead of buying a new one.&quot;

I&nbsp;kept telling friends after that I am going to go bigger the next year, and get a 6 feet one. They just rolled their eyes and thought I&nbsp;was crazy. So my obsession began anew last month, the same moment Metrojaya began setting up their Christmas deco, so yes, they are to be blamed for my insanity. I attempted to refrain from giving in to my obsession to go bigger so I&nbsp;just hauled out the old 5 feet one and set it up, this time with new lights and ribbon garlands. The final result was no different from last year, it ended up looking sad and small in the corner of my living room and I couldn't bring myself to look upon it without feeling ashamed. With vengeance, I&nbsp;renewed my search for a bigger tree despite it being the middle of November, visiting different malls every few days and yes, bloody Metrojaya, in hopes of finding the tree of my dreams. No such luck from the latter considering their most decent trees were priced from RM400 onwards but God did it made my obsession burn. Just with luck, Carrefour was starting to sell trees, and the 6 feet one (made in Vietnam) was going for just RM50, and the branches look really thick with needles too. I could have made a Dr. Evil expression at the thought of getting a tree that large for such a steal. 

So off I&nbsp;trotted home, delighted with my bargain to set up my tree. Coincidentally, Laynie was suppose to come over for a DVD night and found herself reluctantly drafted into my insane quest. 

&quot;Why the hell do you have two trees?&quot;

I wasn't about to let my enthusiasm be dampened. But what's this as I began to unpack the thing:

&quot;No hinged branches?&quot;

It didn't look good. No hinged branches means higher susceptibility to wear and tear with each use. It was then I began to realize that nothing comes cheap without consequences. The quality was really poor. So poor that a little branch broke off as I was unfurling it. In my estimates, the tree probably wouldn't last 3 years without looking denuded. But still, I tried being optimistic. So after almost 3 hours, the end result was somewhat better than the previous tree. Not satisfied with the result, I&nbsp;started visiting malls again to compare. Yes, BACK&nbsp;TO&nbsp;METROJAYA... AGAIN. I wasn't going to be outdone, so after getting more trimmings from several places, I decided finally that my tree now looks more presentable...

Or does it?

Something was not right. After more visits to malls and more comparisons made later, I&nbsp;found my tree despite being 6 feet did not have foliage that covered the stand. But no, I&nbsp;wasn't going to feed my insane obsession of Christmas trees anymore. But itchy me, I could not resist a peek at the affluent neighbourbood malls of Bangsar during a lunch outing with whiterabbit.

&quot;My tree needs berries,&quot;&nbsp;I&nbsp;proclaimed.

&quot;Berries?&quot;

&quot;To top the tree!&quot;

So yet another friend fell victim to my obsession and was for an hour dragged around Bangsar Village to look at Christmas decorations. The search turned up fruitless (excuse the pun), so off I went again, TO&nbsp;METROJAYA (curses!) and finally found what I&nbsp;was looking for. Berry branches, at RM10.90 a piece, and I got four. Finally I decided, this was going to be it. No more!&nbsp;Or so I vainly thought...

The nagging feeling that I had gotten myself a bad purchase with the RM50 tree continued to chew at my conscience. So this time I sneaked a peek at Bangsar Shopping Centre during closing hours after my session in the gym, and I&nbsp;caught sight of a nice tree going for RM249. 

&quot;Gulp. Must... resist...&quot;

But I wasn't going to give in so easily, I&nbsp;had to go back this time and compare carefully.&nbsp;I can always decide again tomrrow because I would be around the area. So after coming home and staring at my already set up tree like for what seem like an eternity, I decided Carrefour tree had to go. So again I&nbsp;was in BSC the next day. However after closer inspection, I found I did not like that tree so much, so partially relieved,&nbsp;I did not make the purchase. It didn't end there - I&nbsp;somehow found myself in Pavilion, in the heart of KL.&nbsp;I was doomed the moment I&nbsp;stepped in Parkson. There among the trees available, was a 7 feet tree of excellent quality, with REAL pine cones, selling at RM599 for a discounted price of RM419.30.

&quot;Gag.&quot;

It didn't help that I was also feeling somewhat depressed over the week over issues. The more sad I was, the more likely I&nbsp;will be to do stupid things to keep me preoccupied. I&nbsp;spent the next few hours running around in the Golden Triangle area looking at even MORE decorations in an attempt to discourage myself. I even saw a luxurious tree with detailed pine needles, going for RM1000+. I was going insane. RM419.30 is better than that price right?&nbsp;RIGHT??? My fate was sealed. In the end I was RM419.30 poorer, having two twinks lug my &quot;Austrian Pine&quot; to my car 4 floors down at the other end of the mall. A&nbsp;spectacle that HRH&nbsp;Nut would have been proud of. I&nbsp;spent a total 7 hours taking down my Carrefour tree and setting up the new one&nbsp;over the course of the next 24 hours. I'd even had to get another 2 strings of lights to light the whole tree. Three days later, after regular lunch with Pinky, I ended up with a&nbsp;Christmas angel doll with ceramic hands and head which Pinky insisted she paid for. Guess what, it didn't fit the tree.&nbsp;BLAST!!!! It now sits at the kitchen counter, looking like something from a horror movie and very out of place.

&quot;You are to smack me if you ever see me wandering into anymore Christmas deco sales in malls,&quot; I&nbsp;said to HRH&nbsp;Nut.

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;I&nbsp;probably spent close to RM800 this year on the Christmas tree.&quot;

&quot;Good lord...&quot;

&quot;But then again I&nbsp;heard they have quite nice decos in Great Eastern Mall!&quot;

"event","It's karma probably, 4 weeks after coming back from Hong Kong I&nbsp;find that I am missing the crowded and hectic life of that city. Before I went I was about as excited as a beached jellyfish, and I would honestly admit, I&nbsp;wasn't keen on setting my feet on a land where the Chinese rule. I&nbsp;would happily make an exception for Hong Kong now though I still stand firm that China is a horrible place to be (and my fears proved through the moment I step across the border from Hong Kong into Shenzen). The first day I was there, I was notably bored, probably due to the fact that I&nbsp;was sequestered with my mother's relatives and subjected to the indignity of being dragged around a place where they sell 99.9%&nbsp; women's fashion wholesale. It was later on that I discovered despite the claustrophic streets and inhumane living conditions that Hong Kong had much character. It was like a crazy but dignified grand old dame in her faded finery. Maybe it is case of the grass being greener on the other side but I certainly wouldn't mind settling down there for a few years to work. Maybe I&nbsp;am just totally bored with KL, where gridlock jams are a fact of everyday life, public transport (and everything else, come to think of it) are inefficient, streets are filthy and people move sluggishly like they had lead for breakfast or something. 

I&nbsp;am starting to even miss little details about life in Hong Kong such as how everyone automatically align themselves to the right on the escalator to give way. Compared to here, you'll be lucky if the couple in front take any notice of you standing dangerously close to signal your impatience while they publicly display their willingness to mate for all to see. I'd even started dreaming that I was back in Hong Kong last night. Then again that thrill I got could be similar to the one I&nbsp;had when I first set foot in Singapore back in 1989, when I went back almost 20 years later in 2007, I did not get the familiar thrill I&nbsp;had all those years back. No offence to my Singaporean friends, but I somehow find Singapore... lacking of a soul. Don't get me wrong, it's a very beautiful city, just that it didn't feel real to me. Funnily enough, in 1989, I&nbsp;was much in awe when I&nbsp;first laid eyes on Singapore. Then again I&nbsp;was just a small town boy, where buildings never go higher than 20 storeys, and shopping means visiting the local Fajar or The Store, which I last heard by the way, had gone extinct in my hometown with the arrival of Tesco and&nbsp;Giant. 

Anyway, darn it. I&nbsp;miss Hong Kong. I am so planning to go back next year. All I&nbsp;have to do now is to wait for AirAsia (now everyone can fly!) to come up with the next RM0 fare promotion again."

"event","Turns out I had even bigger reasons to criticize the Beijing 2008 Olympics Opening Ceremony. First, it turns out that part of the fireworks display that was shown on broadcast was faked through computer imagery. Secondly, the little girl that was shown singing ""Ode to the Motherland"" before a live audience turned out not only to be just lip-syncing, she was selected because she looked prettier and more presentable than the child whose voice was used. <br /><br />News report apparently now surfaced that the fireworks display showing the footprints ""walking"" towards the Bird's Nest Stadium was a prerecorded footage specially prepared ""in case"" the real thing did not turn out as planned. One had to ask, is that altogether necessary? I can understand the pressure to make sure everything turns out ""perfect"", but to the extent of faking such a little thing like this?

I don't think I need to comment further on this because I think this news report has said it well enough. Also I happened to look through the Athens 2004 Opening Ceremony videos on youtube, and found that the Chinese have copied most of the concepts of the Greek. So one thing is for sure, you know the Chinese definitely highlighted the one thing they are most famous for: <b>PIRACY</b>."

"event","<b>Disclaimer: This entry contains my personal views of China and the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics which MAY offend over-zealous Chinese nationalists as well as misguided Chinese supremicists and guess what? I don't care. Read at your own risk.</b><br /><br />I find it curious as to why my fellow Chinese (the race, not the nationality) who were born and bred here in Malaysia would be asking questions like, ""Don't you feel proud now to be Chinese?"" in reference to the Beijing Olympics. First of all, I don't consider myself Chinese, but Malaysian. Secondly I equate that question to someone asking me if I am proud&nbsp; because my cousin three times removed scored the lottery. He's rich, but I am not likely to gain anything nor be associated with it. I am a second generation Malaysian-Chinese who has never set foot in China. Don't get me wrong, I am very proud of my heritage. As ""banana"" as I can be, I think I know more about Chinese culture than the average so-called Chinese educated Chinese. Thirdly, I have never been fond of communist China. I believe George Orwell's <i>Animal Farm</i> describes it very well and I often see it as a greedy, corrupted and corpulent nation bent of having more than it can handle. Yes, I am pro-independence for Tibet. So when Beijing got the vote to host the 2008 Olympics, I was pretty much indifferent other than the fact I was very much interested in seeing how China is going to showcase its illustrious history and culture to the world.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the Olympics, and I love how each opening and closing ceremony is colourful display of the identity of the host nation/city. But for all the hype and controversy that dogged the Beijing Olympics, I found myself highly disappointed when the 29th Summer Olympics were finally officiated at the quirky ""Bird's Nest"" Stadium tonight. For all the culture China promised at the closing ceremony in Athens 2004, none of it followed through four years later. The performance was ambiguous and vague. I am not sure if they had some kind of display board over at the live venue that explained what it was they were trying to show but I would imagine if I am not someone well informed in Chinese history or culture, I would be lost in the whole razzle-dazzle: from the psychedelic apsaras to the group Tai Chi. The famous Beijing Opera saw only a brief limelight, and even that was pretty much diluted.<br /><br />Probably in an attempt to downplay China's imperialistic past which the communist government saw as decadent, they instead opted for some kind of brief narration of the Chinese civilisation via the invention of paper and pushing several other ""great Chinese inventions"" in your face while omitting a few thousand years worth of colourful Chinese history. They were resourceful with technology I would give them that, but the organisers seem more preoccupied with dazzling the audience with the technology than telling a proper story. Take example from the Greeks - they managed to display the history of Greece with a simple yet effective display. Then again, it was Zhang Yimou (of <i>Hero</i> and <i>Curse of the Golden Flower</i> fame) at the helm whose trademark I believe, is confusion. Transitions were choppy, as if they couldn't decide what they want to highlight and they proceeded to wrap it all up in some misguided nationalistic pride. Hell, they shouldn't have chosen ""One World, One Dream""&nbsp; as their slogan, but instead opted for, ""Bigger Than Yours, Better Than Yours"". If anyone didn't notice, when the Chinese contingent marched in, even their little flags had to have longer handles than the rest of everyone.&nbsp; <br /><br />Proud to be Chinese? Yes. Just not the country."

"event","As predicted, the ""public mourning"" for Heath Ledger has died down as news associated with his death begins to drop from the headlines. Barely a week ago I found myself the target for ""cyber assassination"" for openly criticising the public mourning for an actor whom none of us really know other than the roles he played and what the tabloids report.

""He's dead. He ain't getting any deader. Get over it.""

Not that I am being insensitive. It's a tragedy that one so young with such a bright future ahead of him is prematurely snuffed out but that is all there is to it for one among many who doesn't know who Mr. Ledger really is. Closer to home, if anybody really bothered to read the newspapers nowadays, the promising life of a young medical student had also been prematurely terminated in a road accident caused by a bus driver with 30 summonses. As far as I am concerned, she deserved to be mourned as much as Mr. Ledger, but nobody but her family and friends are feeling it. The only difference is she was not some celebrity who frequently made the pages of magazines and entertained us on the silver screen. But she could have been a promising doctor who might have saved plenty of lives if she had lived. So no, I do not believe in mourning for people I do not know, especially foreign celebrities, as influential as they may be.

I also find it strange that people feel for Heath Ledger for the roles that he played and not the life that he led - namely Brokeback Mountain. First of all, Heath Ledger was not gay, and neither was Ang Lee's adaptation of Annie Proulx short story about gay cowboys very realistic either. Remember it was a story written in such a way as to play with one's emotions. Pity that nobody really remembered his role as a gay athlete having to deal with prejudice and coming out in the Australian teen series Sweat which was by far more set in reality. I find ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" cheesy at best.

Whilst Mr. Ledger is being buried amidst the media circus and mass mourning surrounding his tragic demise, many also seem to have missed the circumstances of his death. Though purely through evidential speculation at the moment, he seem to have overdosed on prescription drugs - a disturbingly common tale associated with celebrities nowadays. Don't get me wrong, I am not belittling those with illnesses that genuinely need such drugs, but people are turning to using prescription drugs as easily as popping a couple of aspirins. Though it is unknown as to whether Mr. Ledger truly needed them, the more nagging question was did he know the dangers of it. There was a lesson to be learned from his death and from many others that died like him, but many seem to be more interested in lamenting how they will never see his presence on the silver screen again while many more turn to drugs because it seems like such a hip thing to do when you are ""depressed"".

Make no mistake, Heath Ledger was very human. He was a father, a brother and a son. But like every one of us he was just as fallible. To quote Neil Gaiman's The Sandman character Death:

""You lived what anybody gets, Bernie. You got a lifetime. No more. No less. You got a lifetime.""

It couldn't be more aptly said. So enough with the howling hysterical sorrow and let the dead sleep."

"event","Take note that this is not an attack on the Malaysian police as a whole, but I can safely say that with how most of the force are behaving, it is starting to make their conduct questionable. This morning while once again braving the daily morning traffic horror at the LDP Sunway toll, what appeared to be a cop on a motorcycle stopped at the side of my car about 10 meters away from the toll when it was about to be my turn. Without saying anything, he made gestures to what seem like to me that I should follow my queue (which I was), then he proceeded to the same to the other line at the adjacent toll. Just as I was about to enter, he again pulled up at my side. This time I lowered my window to see what was the matter. In a rude tone he said:

""Pergilah tepi! You tak faham kah?"" (Move to the side! You don't understand?"")

It was then I realised that he was an outrider escorting some VIP. First of all, let me state that I believe that nobody, no matter how important they are, except ambulances or emergencies, should be given way on the road. By the look of how comfy this group of VIPs were in their car, they don't seem to be in any kind of emergency. Like everyone they should suffer like the rest of us stuck in the jam every morning. I mean we pay our taxes as well don't we? And if the VIP is a politician, all the more he/she should feel what the rest of us are feeling. After all, it's their fault for not managing the traffic system well. Take a look at the late Ghafar Baba who always insisted that he should not be escorted by outriders because he doesn't want to inconvenience other people. God rest his soul.

But I digress, I was much taken aback by the rudeness of this cop that I actually yelled back at him, ""Belakang pun sudah block! Kalau boleh jalan, jalan sajalah!"" (The back is already blocked! If they can move then move!"")

Still, I was forced to give way, to not one VIP car, but several others as well in the entourage, further aggravating the jam which already had tempers flaring all around. This won't be the first time I had bad blood with the Malaysian police. Years back when I was still in high school, I had the very unfortunate experience of witnessing police brutality after being forced to participate in a police line-up. Not that I was the victim of their oppression of course. Me and several group of people had their identification cards illegally detained (I didn't know it was illegal then) by the police after what seem like a routine check at an arcade centre. We were told to go to the police station to collect them. We were made to wait in a small room and not told why we there. There was an open door connected to the next room where I could see a disheveled man in handcuffs being harassed by several plainclothes policemen. To my shock, they started assaulting him and told him to squat underneath a desk while one of them rested his foot on him like a footrest!

Never in my life have I ever witnessed with my own eyes a man being treated this way. It was almost as if he was worse than an animal. When the guy who was using him as a footrest saw me looking, he immediately went to close the door, as if he knew what he was doing was not meant to be witnessed by the public. I don't know what crime he has committed then but later did I find out he was a snatch thief after he was ""herded"" among us in a line-up while two women were brought in to identify him. It was after that incident that I lost my respect for the Malaysian police force in general.

Years later I had the ""privilege"" to experience police corruption at work after I was stopped for using the handphone whilst driving. My fault of course, and out of fear, I accepted the offer to bribe after he falsely threatened me that my driving license would be revoked on the spot and my driving privileges will be suspended for months pending hearing in court when in truth I would just be issued a summon. I lost RM100 in the process and feeling dirty having participated in the illegal transaction. Last year in May I was also summoned without notice after I was given warning that I cannot drive in a taxi/bus lane near KLCC. I only found out I had a summon after a colleague checked my record online, much to my disgust.

And who doesn't know that our police is already well known for inefficiency? I am sure anybody who had the unfortunate need to report a crime or IC loss will know. My ex had his house broken into once, and all they did was come around few hours later, look around half-heartedly and take a few statements. All that CSI thing you see on TV? I am beginning to wonder if it really does exist. If you are one of the common folk like me, don't expect to ever recover your stolen property, not unless you're a Datuk or Tan Sri, of which a suspect (or scapegoat) will definitely be in hand within the next 48 hours.

Having said that, I am sure they are a few dedicated men of law out there, just that the bad probably outweighs the good. If they are unhappy being underpaid then by all means go do something else. The rest of us have to deal with being unhappy with our jobs, I don't see why we have to deal with their disgruntled manners as well"

"event","I know this entry is two days late but better late than never? Basically it's about Valentine's Day. No I didn't exactly celebrate it but that has always been a norm. In fact, the day almost slipped by with no consciousness that it's day that commemorates love. 

Strangely though, if any of you do not know, the celebration is associated of course with three saints of the same name, which of course, was Valentine or Valentinus. All three were martyred (that is, executed or killed in the name of religion). In the year 496, Pope Gelasius I declared February 14 their feast day although the old man himself had no inkling of the origins of the three saints. At least one of whom was believed to be a heretic. All romantic notions concerning St. Valentine apparently surfaced during the middle ages. For all we know, we could be celebrating what was originally some pagan orgy fertility festival. Hence, the whole symbolism of flowers representing vaginas. I can imagine delighted females (and some males) now, ""Oh darling! A bouquet of vaginas? For me? You're so sweet... (sniffs 'vaginas')"".

But no, I am not being bitter that I had yet again spent Valentine's Day single. I was in fact still teaching classes and making remarks (complete with feathered wings and pink top) like, ""Hi, I am Cupid's brother. My name is Stupid..."". In fact through some clever twist, I managed to link the topic of love to exercise. No of course I am not bitter, but don't you hypocritical fools who claimed you despise the day come whining to me that your boyfriend/girlfriend/date gave you something you didn't like or that the sight of girls parading around with their bouquets of vaginas made you sneer because it made you think they won Ms Universe or something. I will pie you down with words so nasty it will make nuns pray desperately for my soul.

Okay, now that I have got that out, let's talk about love. No, not the kind that involves potential shag partners or the ones you imagine walking down the aisle with, complete with a bouquet of white vaginas. Like most celebrations, we take for granted the true meaning of the day which is now layered over with commercialisation. Just like how Christmas seems to have more to do with Santa Claus nowadays than it has to do with the birth of Jesus Christ (whom by the way is not really born in December but theoretically somewhere in April). It's not just love between two souls or one soul in two bodies or whatever, remember it's a day that pays tribute to love. Not just love for your partner, but love for your family, love for your friends and most importantly, love for yourself. So why bother anyway being sulky with the fact that you spent it single. Seems rather absurd to me that anybody would want to associated the day with someone not even related to you than with people whom have loved you for years. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean you should neglect your partners on that day. I think I have a tendency to neglect myself for the ones I care about. I love caring for others.

If anybody has watched Love Actually, I think that has the most politically correct interpretation of love so far. Not every character in the movie ends up with a conventional happy ending but it all ends on the realisation of what love really is. The most touching scene in the movie? No, it's not the one with Andrew Lincoln with his ""To me you're perfect"" placard at Keira Knightley's door. It's the scenes of real life people meeting at the airport. That's what love is. That's what it's all about. You get the idea...

"event","Someone once told me that if he was to have contracted a fatal illness, he would take all his savings and go on an European tour without informing anyone and then die an unknown, where his fate will never be known by those who knew him.

I said, ""It doesn't matter where you go, where you choose to end your life but at that final moment before it goes dark, I will be there for you. Not physically of course, but in your heart, you know I will be there.""

When my grandaunt died, I thought I had lost the only person who ever believed in me. My grandaunt was not a demanding person and she believed in rewarding even the most simple of achievements, even if it is nothing fair in the eyes of others. And perhaps for all my failures, she believed in me still. It didn't matter if my exam results rank me within the end half of the whole form, she would still reward me in money. It wasn't the value of the gift that mattered, it was the gesture of what it meant. And for that it meant a thousand words that my own mother couldn't express. 

I didn't even have a picture taken with her, something I had always wanted to do but never came about doing for some reason. As if knowing that such a thing would never come to be, she once showed me her old photo albums and told me that when she is gone, I would be the caretaker. When she went peacefully in her sleep, I said nothing and took the albums after the funeral, despite my aunt's protests that I was being selfish. Why bother explaining to someone who would never appreciate the meaning of the legacy my grandaunt left behind.

For the longest time, I remained bitter over her passing. I felt she was 'robbed' from me. But in time I realised something more important - that she never really left me. Her legacy was more than just two albums of pictorial memories. I was her living testament. 

We carry a little of dead and a little of the living with us, and perhaps for that we are never truly alone or bereft. The watermark on the pages of our lives.

Go say your thanks tomorrow and find your peace. Nothing is ever really too late."

And you'll be sure that the hunch is 100% correct when the same one giggles at a detail of a naked saint from the Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel frescoes and says ""So small..."". Be assured that he did not mean the size of the print.

"event","For some reason, I always seem to have lucid dreams/nightmares about unfinished school/university assignments. Something I am suppose to do but have procrastinated or forgotten to do and I have to borrow a classmate's to copy. And it's not just some simple assignment, it's something that's worth MONTHS of work. Strangest thing is, I've been out of school for almost seven years and university about two. Never in those years have I ever left any assignments unfinished anyway. 

Just a side note, I am writing this at an ungodly hour because I am having insomnia, something which rarely ever affects me. And no, it's not caused by those dreams. Just something that I remembered since I got nothing better to do at this hour. What I would do now for a reassuring hug while I sleep."

<div align=""left"">Isn't it gorgeous? The Battle for Middle-Earth is its name. Pictured here is probably the siege of Minas Tirith. I haven't got to that part yet. Last night I spent three hours defending Helm's Deep against Saruman's hoardes. Then I spent another 30 minutes laying waste to Isengard. Finally I feel once again the familiar thrill of sleepless nights gaming after so many years in a hiatus. The movie might have completed its trilogy three years ago but this game definitely brings back the familiar awesome feel of Lord of the Rings. Most of the details from the movie were there - things like the flight through Moria down the destruction of the Deeping Wall. The story though begins from the Fellowship's formation, not from the discovery of the One Ring in the the Shire. However, thanks to me the storyline has changed somewhat. Boromir still lives and helped defend Rohan. On the downside, I got Eowyn, Theoden and Pippin (or is it Merry?) killed. Which mind you, was way better than my first and second attempt to defend Helm's Deep - I got every single one of the main heroes, except Gandalf and Eomer, killed. Pippin or Merry (can never differentiate between those two) was accidently killed during the storming of Isengard when I failed to notice the damn fool standing there while orcs rained him with arrows. I love the Rohirrim. Their cavalry charge is almost hilarious although devastatingly effective against foot soldiers. I just love watching orcs/goblins/uruk-hais fly in all directions as the horsemen crash right into them.

The really bad side is, due to my PC's antiquated system, the game takes ages to load (up to 5+ minutes per campaign) and occasionally stalls whenever there are too many activities going on in the terrain. Oh God, I can't wait to go home and spend another orgasmic night with my new love."

"event","For some apparent reason, I stayed home on a Sunday night just so I could watch the new Tarzan starring the Calvin Klein underwear boy Travis Fimmel just because 'he' said so. Well OK, maybe I didn't exactly stayed home to wait for it - I sort of went out to have dinner, grab a few groceries and made it back before it started at 9pm. I was thinking it had better be good, considering I was wasting an hour of my Sunday night to watch it. Doesn't matter that I actually didn't have anything better to do, I could have like contemplated on what makes the universe tick and become the new enlightened one. So anyway, for once in a long time I returned to the role of couch potato and tried to enjoy this yet another adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' creation which by the way co-stars Xena herself (that would be Lucy Lawless) and Agent Skinner (Mitch Pileggi).

Half an hour later I began to wonder why did I ever put myself through the agony of watching such crap for the sake of someone else. Doesn't matter that I did not catch the pilot episode, I thought it was a lame idea now that Tarzan is trapped in a concrete jungle (that would be NYC), instead of a real jungle. Xena and Skinner barely appeared for more than 10 minutes throughout the whole hour, while the main stars seem to have only one expression. For example...

Jane: What are you doing here?! *Sulk*
Tarzan: You're hurt. *Pout* I can see it in your eyes. *Pout*
Jane: You shouldn't be here! *Sulk*
Tarzan: I want to help. *Pout*
Jane: Go away! I don't need your help. *Sulk*

Jane: Where were you?! We have wasted a lot of time! *Sulk*
Tarzan: This is how I hunt. *Pout*
Jane: Look... *Sulk*
Tarzan: This is how I hunt. *Pout*
Jane: .... *Sulk*

Did I also mention Jane kind of looks haggard? I bet the actress is probably older than Travis Fimmel. Speaking of which, somehow the pretty boy himself doesn't look that pretty on a motion camera. Fine, I admit being a closet perv of him, but this series kind of lowered my opinion of him. He can't act for peanuts. It's hard to be convinced that he is supposed to be some young man brought up by primates when he looks so adoringly well-kept all the time. You would think after subtracting all the acting talents from it they would at least have some gratuitous shirtless scenes of him but no such luck. Through the whole hour, he was running/climbing around New York dressed like any other grungy surfer on an off day. After a whole hour pouting and sulking between the two main stars, I helplessly found myself pouting and sulking along with them. Oh Travis... you should have stayed in CK's motionless monotones...

Thank God after that Smallville came on. They had plenty of gratuitous shirtless scenes of Tom Welling. I could then at least forgive the senseless plot. Don't worry, I haven't gone all superficial. I had a dose of some new sitcom by Whoopi Goldberg which had a full half an hour of acerbic wit and Bush-bashing. I love that woman."

And for those whom I have never explained this to, consider this a revelation. For those of you who already know this but who keeps on whinging about my entries just because it doesn't go well with your stomach, well the best solution I have for you is STOP READING IT. As the cantonese would say, you can't force a cow to drink water. But if insistent you are in reading it then either stomach it or go vomit elsewhere. By the way if you are persistent in vomitting in here, please tag your vomit with your identity so next time I can list you down and everyone can see what retarded bean you are. Also, I have encountered a lot who speed through entries without reading carefully and end up making the wrong conclusions. Don't worry that doesn't mean you're bad, it just means you're a person lacking in time. You are only diseased when you do the above and then proceed to fart your unwelcomed comments. If that is the case, sorry to ruin your expectations but I tend not to delete them, but rather I prefer to leave your fart where it is so everyone else can smell what a stinker you are. 

For those of you who felt a sting while reading this, I'm so sorry but it is more than likely this entry refers to you. Don't take it badly though. It only goes to show that I am thinking about you. That's more than you'll ever get from anybody else. Now isn't that grand?"

"event","On the second Bali bombings:

It's at times like these that makes you wonder if there is really a God. Bali has always been a peaceful island, albeit belonging to an occasionally turbulent and corrupt country with the government changing leadership every now and then. With all that going on, it has always been relatively removed from the unruly politics of its parent country. But yet, we have fanatical lunatics who strap themselves with explosives blowing themselves up for causes they themselves probably have little understanding of. The biggest irony of all is, the majority of those ended up killed happened to be locals. More than likely they were thinking the path would take them to some paradise where a bevy of naked virgins await them. I bet they would be changing their minds now as Satan teaches what it feels like to be his bitch.

On the possibility of the discovery of the 10th planet of our solar system:

Indeed, there is no God. The possible tenth planet is currently named after a fictitious metal bustier clad warrior princess played by Lucy Lawless from TVland. That's Xena for those of you who does not understand where I am leading. To add insult to the injury, its also recently discovered companion satellite is currently named after her possibly lesbian partner Gabrielle. The good news is, the dumb ass astronomer who discovered it is in no authority to name the possible planet, so the ridiculous name is not permanent. Maybe there is a God after all."

See, I don't squander my hard earned muscles on vanity alone. Nevermind the fact that my action of dragging those locked vehicles would probably damage the tyres (I don't really care), it often irks me that people can't have the simple courtesy or civic-consciousness to park their transports properly. I don't ignore the fact that the moronic management did not provide proper parking bays for motorcycles, but the residents have already sacrificed one parking spot meant for a car for motorcyclists. Oh no, they had to push it further by taking up TWO spaces. Give an inch ask a yard. It drives me up the wall to come back to find I have no more space to park my car and just ONE or TWO bikes occupying a HUGE parking space while there's plenty of space left in the spot we allocated for them. 

Tomorrow I'll go work harder in the gym. Perhaps then I will have enough strength to not only move those bikes, but also help relocate them to a more appropriate space, like the dumpster or the drain."

""What I'm hearing, which is sort of scary, is they all want to stay in Texas. Everyone is so overwhelmed by the hospitality. And so many of the people in the arena here, you know, were underprivileged anyway, so this -- this is working very well for them,"" - former First Lady Barbara Bush in a radio interview in reference to evacuees of Hurricane Katrina.

""Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job."" - President George W. Bush praising FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) chief Michael Brown who is currently a lightning rod for criticism due to his poor response towards the situation.

""Out of the rubbles of Trent Lott's house -- he's lost his entire house -- there's going to be a fantastic house. And I'm looking forward to sitting on the porch,"" - President George W. Bush referring to a filthy rich senator's destroyed home amidst the plight of thousands of poor displaced people.

The president has also come under fire for paying tribute to ravaged New Orleans as a place he used to visit years ago ""to enjoy myself -- occasionally too much,"" an apparent reference to the days before he quit drinking. Is he trying to save the city or downgrade it?

Initially he also made a comment that no one anticipated that New Orleans' levees would break -- even though various federal and state agencies had warned of that scenario.

Very much earlier, concerning about the war in Iraq, sweet old dame Babs Bush had this to say:

""Why should we hear about body bags, and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or what do you suppose? It's not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that?"" 

Senior Bush is much smarter to keep his mouth shut and put more action into raising funds with Bill Clinton."

"event","One of the more sad stories that came out of the disasterous flooding of New Orleans at the wake of Hurricane Katrina (for me at least) are those of how pets were abandoned during the evacuation. For goodness sake, why in the world are the so-called ""rescuers"" forcefully separating pets from their owners? Don't animals have the right to live too? It horrified me to read how pet owners had to make the difficult choice of putting their pets to sleep so that they would not starve to death as the authorities would not allow them to evacuate together. The said veterinarian had since stopped after he found he just couldn't go through with it, so the animals were temporarily taken care of till they could be reunited with the owners. Even so, eye witness accounts of how rescuers going from house to house finding nothing other than an abandoned animal, a trapped hungry, thirsty dog on a roof lapping up the putrid floodwaters, another tied to a barrier along a deserted highway, it breaks my heart. 

After all the bungled and delayed relief attempts, can't the US government right a simple wrong by saving these animals? Are these not the very creatures we come to rely on when it comes to saving the lives of those trapped undetected by human senses? Is it so difficult to just let pet owners leave with their animals? Of course there will be the excuses that these animals might carry diseases or take up space meant for people. I am sure all the authorities need to do is just ask for volunteers, there will be no shortage of good American veterinarians who will step up to the challenge. As far as I can read, there has been a poor response in persuading people to leave anyway, why not just rescue whatever life they could find other than just those of people? Then there are those who refuse to leave unless their pets come along with them. To those brave souls, I salute you. Faced with such a similar situation, I am not sure I would want to leave either if I had to abandon my dogs to face an unknown fate. Frankly, I will sooner die with them then flee knowing I survived by signing their death warrant. Kudos also to the International Fund for Animal Welfare and Code-3 Associates for their efforts in rescuing trapped and abandoned animals in the city."

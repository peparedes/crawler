"event","Sadly, I forgot to log the hatching. Remembered right as I logged out. Ah well. I was utterly astonished to impress, primarily because I've been MIA the last 2 weeks dealing with the plague. ;) But without further adieu, here's Falanth:<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""Orchid Blossom Green Falanth""><strong>Dam: Diya's gold Nenuith<br />Sire: E'hran's bronze Skolnikovth</strong><br /><strong>Theme: Rebels With a Cause&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> IC Date: Day 6, Month 10, Turn 2<br />Total Eggs: 33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Color Dist: Bz4, Br4, Bl8, Gr17<br /><br />Name inspiration:</strong>&nbsp;Disney's ""Mulan"" was the inspiration for this dragon, and the origin of her name. ""Fa"" comes from Mulan's family name: it was for the honor of her father, Fa Zhou, that Mulan risked her life and enlisted in the army. ""Lan"" comes from the second half of Mulan's own name, which in Chinese means ""orchid:"" in the movie, an orchid blossom symbolizes her growth from uncertainty to self-sufficiency. Falanth is pronounced with soft A's: Fah-lawnth.<br /><br /><strong>Hatchling desc:</strong>&nbsp;Although lithe and small, something about this hatchling strikes of a more bracing character than the typical dainty green. A slim nose brushes out into a wide jaw and large, gleaming eyes overset by the slanted stroke of heavy eyeridges. These last scroll back all the way to the line of ridges running down her spine, ridges which raise so high and to such long points that they look almost like stylized waves. Her hide reinforces the idea, washed in a green so deep and murky it approaches oceanic teal. That color lessens only for the fine, long arches of her claws, a mild and milky jade at odds with the fierce way she holds them ever-flexed as though to grab hold of Pern itself. Already she has the muscles to back it up, heavy shoulders, broad quarters and a firm, braced stance. Yet, though poised for it, she is not wholly built for aggression, with a slim chest and slender belly that slopes up gently to her flank.<br /><br /><strong>Personality:</strong>&nbsp;Torn in two by conflicting impulses, Falanth will at the very beginning be a bundle of rapid-shifting moods. Aggressive one instant, cuddly the next, she will stabilize with time and encouragement but for those first few months will run you ragged trying to keep up. Of course, she doesn't mean to be demanding, and she'll apologize like mad if she realizes that she's being so. See, she /wants/ to be a good green - and that's the heart of the problem. She's a fighting dragon, which means she should be tough and fierce and all those things - and she is. But she's also female, which means she should be nurturing and understanding and all /those/ things - and she's that, too. Making it all worse is a driving need to prove her worth to everyone around her, combined with social awkwardness and humility that sometimes make it hard for her to assert herself, and even harder to take credit for her achievements when she does.<br /><br />Time will certainly ease that, though, as she grows used to her surroundings and finds friends among her clutchmates - although she's initially shy, her gentler nature kicks in for anyone patient enough to seek it, and her underlying warmth and generosity make her friendship worthwhile. It's this aspect of her personality that will dominate later months of weyrlinghood, making it seem at times as though she's completely overcome her fiercer drive. Don't be fooled: that second half is still lurking beneath the veneer, leaving her antsy and plagued by secret doubts, prone to careless mistakes borne of her distraction. Although she's unwilling to talk about herself in this period, and will dodge your efforts with meek apologies and silence, she will bring her nurturing personality to bear on you, trying to understand your issues with your father. Is it G'thon? Her impulse says you should respect your father, but it also says he failed you at the trial. Is it X'nel? Sure he acted like a father to you growing up, but then he got you in trouble! Prepare to be pressed on this issue, and pressed tirelessly - Falanth will drop the subject when you ask her, sure, but she'll bring it right back up a few days later. Through you, she's trying to work out her own understanding of family and community and the part of her nature to which she's constricting herself at this time.<br /><br />Then there will be Thread. While you're weyrlings, running support for the fighters and sticking to the background, she'll pretend she's not interested. Once you get in the air together, and flame your first Fall ... then, then Falanth will really start to shine. It's not that she'll undergo a complete transformation, or become a warrior-woman extraordinaire: she'll always have that meek and tender side, but she'll find the bedrock underneath. She has a knack for problem-solving in unorthodox ways and a drive to benefit her community - her family - no matter what it takes. Combine her traits and yours, and the two of you will make a fearsome team. Will there be mistakes? Of course - Falanth can be impetuous, she can overextend herself, she can be laid low by those moments of self-conflicted doubt. Will there be giving up? &lt;&lt; No, Gananye. We have to see this to the end. &gt;&gt;<br /><br /><strong>Inspiration:</strong> Mulan was the hero of a Disney movie released in 1998, which in turn was based on a Chinese legend dating as far back as the 6th century. In any version, the tale is basically the same: to save her elderly father from being conscripted, Mulan puts on man's clothes and joins the army, winning such great distinction that the emperor himself asks her to take up a government post. She refuses in order to return to her family. Disney's Mulan was distinguished particularly by exceptional wit and fierce determination which, combined, allowed her to overcome all obstacles.<br /><br /><strong>Hatch Message:</strong> The little green head pokes through first, gasping for breath while the rest of her remains curled in the shell. Not for long. With a heave and a loud cry of protest against her imprisonment, the green pushes her egg apart and scrambles upright, bracing her legs defiantly while she looks over the candidates. After a moment or two, the orchid blossom green takes a stiff, awkward step, and warily begins her search.<br /><br /><strong>Public Impress message:</strong> Snapping and snarling, the orchid blossom green has made her way all along the candidate line and back, with still no luck. She begins to pace, impatient, and her strides become narrower by the second. Suddenly she looks up and lets out a gentle warble, settling her gaze upon one of the older candidates. Age, it seems, means nothing to this baby, who takes a few uncertain steps before falling into an all-out dash and crooning to Gananye.<br /><br /><strong>Impress message:</strong>&nbsp;You have a moment of warning. A little green meets your eye, but there's no rush of accompanying contact: only her red eyes whirling faster. Moment's gone. A wash of color wipes across your thoughts, covering them and seeping through your mind. It's shelter and it's isolation, it's endless and that's terrifying. But you are not alone. She is here, and she does not know where to go either. &lt;&lt; Hello? &gt;&gt; Her mind reaches out to curl tightly around yours. &lt;&lt; Gananye? My name's Falanth. I - well, I'd like to eat now, please. &gt;&gt;</div><br />Other impressees were:<br />L'vok (Laivok) with Worn Leather Brown Benreth <br />K'tric (Katric) with Lithe of Step Auroral Green Kasvatuth <br />L'mon (Laemont) with Glittering Lights Blue Manierath <br />Riseli with Force of Personality Green Ralkoth <br />P'dian (Padian) with Forest Sunset Bronze Rodhaketh <br />D'rian (Daurian) with Northern Sky Bronze Taikath <br />Shanti with Sun and Shadows Green Toth"

<p>Leading Edge - Friday, May 26, 2006, 1:03 PM<br />--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Northern Bowl</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bowl floor is a broad expanse of gravel and dust, packed flat over decades of dragonweight landing on it. Kept free of vegetation, the only color variation across the vast hollow of the bowl are the dragons, in good weather often found sunning on low ledges or sprawled along the floor itself. The well-worn, charcoal-grey walls of the bowl are nearly vertical, far too steep for even the most adventurous climber to attempt. The rim of the bowl, marked by a rainbow of perching dragons at all times of the day, is topped with massive stone spires that stretch upwards into the blue vault of the sky. There are seven in all, great black fingers of stone that seem, from where you stand, to touch the clouds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of tunnels breach the walls of the bowl, leading to various indoor parts of the Weyr. To the southwest, a vast tunnel entrance descends to the baths, curls of steam seeping out on colder days. On the northern face of the stone, a huge gaping maw betrays the presence of the Hatching cavern. Somewhat more modest tunnel entrances lead to the living caverns and the versatile classroom chamber to the west, and the Weyrleaders' complex to the east. In the distance to the south, the vast grey-blue of the lake stretches off to meet the southern wall of the bowl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a clear autumn day and the air has become crisp, stirred by breezes cool enough to redden cheeks. The sky is cloudless and a dazzling shade of blue.</p>
<p><br />Milina arrives from the southern section of the bowl.<br />Milina has arrived.</p>
<p>Eirth arrives from the southern section of the bowl.<br />Eirth has arrived.</p>
<p>I'lyan is standing in the bowl, looking up. Eyes are shaded by one hand, and he's watching Koriscath in the skies above.</p>
<p>Eirth slinks out of the dragon baths well before any sign of the rider that normally comes with her is seen. Now Milina takes her times exiting the baths, letting the green do as she pleases before joining her. ""G'day."" is the familiar greeting that's called out in unison with the greens warble.</p>
<p>I'lyan turns at the greeting, nodding politely. ""Weyrling. Your green looks well."" There is a rush of air, and Koriscath drops in for a landing, backwinging showily. The green is given a once over by the Benden bronze and a vague snort of greeting.</p>
<p>Koriscath descends from the sky above.<br />Koriscath has arrived.</p>
<p>Milina merely smiles in return, a hand laying upon Eirths neck in affection ""She does, doesn't she."" Oh the pride that fills those words is so thick that one could slice it with a knife. The arrival of the bronze brings little more then a moments notice by the pair, the green chuffing softly as her wing flick a few times before settling at her sides. ""Your a Caucus student. Reaches perhaps?""</p>
<p>I'lyan shakes his head. ""Benden. This fellow is Koriscath,"" the bronze rumbles softly, ""And I'm I'lyan. M'arik's wingsecond."" A pause and he asks, ""How old is Erith now, ah... I'm sorry, I don't remember your name?"" The dragon he got. The girl? Not so much.</p>
<p>Eirth isn't known for being shy, she isn't know for being anything more then the dark hued huntress she is really. So her leaving of Milina's side isn't odd, since she's merely going to prowl slowly about the much larger bronze with something akin to interest. ""Milina rider to Green Eirth there in the Weyrling wing here.""</p>
<p>Koriscath turns his head to watch the green, his expression bemused. His rider, however, remains polite and remote. ""Training going well I hope? Reaches needs all the riders you can get with the difficult falls you've had."" He smiles ruefully, ""I've been trying to convince the Weyrleader to bend the rules a bit to allow Kori and I to fly with the wings. No success, yet, but I'm persistant.""</p>
<p>Eirth cants her head to the right as she stares up at Koriscath, eyes whirling a placid blue as she watches him rather intently...almost to intently.</p>
<p>R'vain arrives from the southern section of the bowl.<br />R'vain has arrived.</p>
<p>Eirth cants her head to the right as she stares up at Koriscath, eyes whirling a placid blue as she watches him rather intently...almost to intently. ""It'd be a pity to turn down another good fighter when we need them, cant' see why they'd turn you down."" The 'ling offers back as she moves closer the bronzer so she can see the smaller green better ""Eirth I don't think he'd enjoy having you hunt him down like a herdbeast.""</p>
<p>Koriscath snorts, amused at the half-grown green. He studiously turns his head away from her, petending not to notice her now. As his tail twitches invitingly, I'lyan smiles briefly, ""He's no objection to a quick game of tag in the air, but he's not much for ground play."" turning away from the dragons to regard the girl he shrugs. ""Caucus rules. Most of the riders in the caucus are too green to be in the air with the wings. M'arik doesn't care if I do - I was a wingleader and flight leader at Benden - but your Weyrleader has to keep to the rules.""</p>
<p>Milina snorts, the sound far from ladylike ""Rules are meant to be broken or seriously bent when need be."" the woman points out with a glint in her eye. ""I can see why the younger ones would be disallowed but a season rider should be given the chance if he or she so wishes to help."" Now with the mention of aerial fun Eirth can't help but be intrigued as she steps lightly away to spread her wings in a muscle warming way ""If R'vain catches you fooling around you don't know what'll happen.""</p>
<p>Far across the bowl, a small altercation occurs. It involves some member of the Weyr's caverns staff, a young man tall and thinly made, fending off the badly thrown blows and snappish remarks of the Weyrlingmaster. Though clearly more poorly made for fighting than the broadly built boor, after a few brief seconds it becomes obvious that the lad has the better of it and shoves bodily R'vain off. It is success enough to buy him a moment to think, then to turn tail and dash into the caverns, leaving the bronzerider to spit and curse after him. But R'vain does not pursue the fight further; instead he turns and starts out across the bowl toward the dragon baths, snarling to himself all the way. ""Good for nothing sprats of dogs of-- "" Why look: a weyrling green stretching her wings. Against apparent expectation, R'vain stops and watches with what might be pleasure, his tirade briefly forgotten. Then a glance at Koriscath, and knowing the young green has an audience, the dark cloud comes back; under its shadow, the Weyrlingmaster stomps around the dragons to seek out their mates.</p>
<p>I'lyan misses the brawl; Koriscath blocks his vision. I'lyan says mildly, ""One would think that, but sadly, that's not the case. The wheat is thrown out with the chaff."" A pause and at the comment about R'vain his eyebrows arch. ""Is she allowed to fly by herself? She *looks* old enough, but you don't need any trouble with the Weyrlingmaster.""</p>
<p>Milina crosses her arms over her chest, blissfully unaware of the Tropical Storm R'vain that's fastly approaching ""Of course, she and Immath were the first in the class to hit the skies."" The pride filled boast brings a grin to her face ""She's allowed, just not with me aboard yet."" Those wings of glory fan out and make a few dirt skattering moves as she stretches with a draconic look of mischief in those whirling eyes.</p>
<p>""She's allowed to fly by herself in the Weyr's sightrange,"" specifies R'vain, rounding the shadows of the beasts green and bronze. His face is still red, but the rage is subsiding into a less lurid glower of general malcontent. ""And you'll be with her soon if I have my rights. Weyrling."" That's a greeting, accompanied by the curtest of nods at Milina; then the Weyrlingmaster's attention is again on I'lyan, nostrils flaring as swift green glance takes in dress, build, knot. The sum total of his response to whatever he sees in those things is a sneering curl of upper lip. ""And hello.""</p>
<p>Looking very much like she'd like to find a rock to crawl under, Milina faces R'vain with a forced smile and a salute. ""G'day Weyrlingmaster."" She comes up with in a tone of respect, before shooting a look at I'layn. ""Can't be to soon for us, she's gain good size and is just inches shorter then the smallest blue in the clutch."" Now see Eirth isn't intimadated by R'vain, not at all. WIth a rumble the younger dragon turns her attention upon him and slides up close with a charming croon. ""She thinks she can take him, being smaller then he she's bound to be harder for him to catch.""</p>
<p>Milina has disconnected.</p>
<p>""I can see you're of Benden. And of Caucus."" And /that/ is all he has to say about /that/-- I'lyan is all but dismissed with those words, not so much as a thought apparently granted to entendres of any number. He turns to Milina and-- you just never know what you'll get from someone like R'vain; point being, that as reward for her swift salute and her dragon's croon, he grants the weyrling, then Eirth herself, each a broad, warm grin. ""Stop that,"" he tells the green, though it does not sound overmuch as if he really means it. ""You'll be afield far enough, soon enough.""</p>
<p>I'lyan chuckles faintly as Koriscath leaps aloft with the green. ""It's not the catching that gives him trouble,"" he says as the weyrling is pulled away be someone else in her class. The Benden rider turns instead to R'vain saying mildly, ""He wants to learn the thermals in the bowl better."" An odd thing to say.</p>
<p>R'vain is silent a long moment after the weyrlings go, after the dragons go. It might seem as if he thinks himself alone in the bowl, even; he does not look at Koriscath's rider, nor reply to him, not for quite some time. His eyes narrow between ruddy lashes and he squints skyward, watching the green and bronze go flying. When they have become small against the ocean of the sky he idly muses, as if he were speaking to himself, ""He'd crush her. Poor sport for a bronzerider to be playing games with greens that young.""</p>
<p>I'lyan eyes R'vain with ill concealed amusement. ""He has no intention of 'catching' her. Nor I of her rider, since that's likely the root of your concern. I'm not interested in children. So."" A pause and he asks politely, ""Shall we try this again? Well met, Weyrlingmaster. I haven't had a chance to meet you or your staff yet. I'm glad we ran into each other.""</p>
<p>""Oh?"" R'vain turns; he regards I'lyan with affected surprise, comical on his blunt and colorful features: wide eyes, arched heavy brows, raised square chin. He sucks out a cluck of-- disapproval?-- with tongue over teeth, then casts out an unpleasant smile and a broad hand, perhaps offering a gesture of greeting and welcome with it. Nothing else about him conveys either welcome /or/ greeting. ""No staff. The wingleaders come down when their schedules afford it. They're all scrambling so much, though..."" His smirk turns cruel. ""They /hardly/ have time.""</p>
<p>I'lyan looks surprised. ""No staff? Really?"" He shakes his head, processing that fact, even as he shakes the other bronzerider's hand. ""How in the world do you manage? Is there anything I can do to help? the Weyrleader won't let me fly with your wings, but assisting you - if you wish - would surely pose no 'danger' to a Caucus student."" His tone holds derision on the words 'caucus student'.</p>
<p>So does R'vain's. ""How would it look for a Caucus student to be shirking his studies to make sure some weyrling's straps have their punch-holes even?"" The heavy brows descend and, with indifference too unenthusiastic to be false, the Weyrlingmaster affords, ""You want to do a session, let me know and I'll schedule you. The Weyr's full of hands-- "" His tone becomes suddenly spitty and harsh on 'full of', and as he draws back his paw to fold arms over chest, he pauses a moment to let his jaw grind. ""I get more help than I need from some people.""</p>
<p>I'lyan studies the man for a long few moments. ""I'm M'arik's wingsecond. The restrictions to keep 'students' safe are - to be blunt - driving me between with boredom."" Speaking of classes, shouldn't he be in one now? He pauses and then says lightly, ""Other students giving too much help? If it'd just interfere I'll withdraw my offer. I've been trying to convince the Weyrleader to allow me to fly with the wings, but."" He shrugs a shoulder, indicating his disapproval of the rules for that.</p>
<p>""I know who you are."" R'vain manages, despite every sign about him pointing to his being a man of rages and rash action, a certain cool detachment of tone in making this remark. ""And no, by and large th'Caucus doesn't trouble us. They're not here t'teach."" The Weyrleader uncrosses his arms and settles a fist on one hip, then strolls a look up and down the other man: second impression taken. ""Nor t'learn, far as I can see."" Timed alongside his once-over, it might be about the Caucus in general or it might just be about the specimen before him. But he leans forward after a moment and explains in a grit-laden grouse, ""Take th'first wing's leader. Since these weyrlings' first day in, hardly a seven goes by he's not snooping around. Some help I don't need."" He sucks that 'tch' across his teeth again and straightens. ""So what kind of help you got in mind?""</p>
<p>I'lyan mms, not taking any offense at an implication of his not being here to learn. Perhaps it's true. ""Well, my specialty's tactics. How far have you gotten as far as memorization of formations and the like? Are they marching in them on the ground yet?"" He admits, ""I'm not as conversant in your training techniques as I am Benden's. Alternatively, I don't mind pitching in with the grunt work: checking straps, PT, that sort of thing."" He frowns, lips thinning, ""I'd just like to do /something/ to help your riders. They're having a hard row.""</p>
<p>""They're riding them on the ground,"" replies R'vain, coolly detached again, but through the trace of smug satisfaction. ""Been marching a while now. Like you say-- there's only one thing t'train 'em for now, ain't there?"" Hard light shines in his eyes and he sets his jaw, defiant, like he expects-- or plans-- to be told he's wrong.</p>
<p>The defiance clearly confuses I'lyan. ""There is,"" he agrees. ""Benden has a few tricker formations that I could also pass on to you to be taught to those likely to eventually lead - if you don't think that might offend the wingleaders? I've not met any of them yet."" Clearly probing for information there, though the comment is neutral enough.</p>
<p>Slowly, the cruel smirk and smug displeasure broaden into something less unpleasant. R'vain, eventually, could be said to be smiling. ""Might offend th'spinner,"" he offers, museful, though a trace of dark warning underlies his tone. ""But /he's/ never offered t'teach Benden's tricks.""</p>
<p>I'lyan says mildly, charitably, ""Well, they might not be useful in the winds over here in the west. I didn't know him well before he left Benden."" There's no doubt he knows who R'vain is speaking of. ""And if they're not, then only the really obsessed will be interested in learning them. But, it's a start. And, as long as all this is 'unofficial', what could it hurt?""</p>
<p>""If you're lucky,"" and suddenly R'vain seems to think this incredibly unlikely-- his tone becomes sour and he turns away from the other man to squint off into the other end of the bowl, his domain where the weyrlings train-- ""you won't have a chance to get to know him here, either."" His mouth curls, revealing his teeth, and after a moment like that the bitter is so strong that the Weyrlingmaster is obliged to turn his head and spit to clear the taste from his palate. ""Can't hurt,"" he adds, simply. ""S'long as it doesn't get you in trouble with th'man who sent you here.""</p>
<p>I'lyan shakes his head, saying confidently, ""My time away from the Caucus 'studies' is my own. So far, the classes are review."" So that explains why he's cutting them. ""So I'll be glad to come whenever you like. Give me a good chance to see more of the weyr too. And the wingleaders, meet them and the like.""</p>
<p>""Meet the wingleaders?"" R'vain turns back around, one brow cocked up. ""Hardly likely, in most cases. Like I said, they're so busy scrambling. I don't see much of most of them."" Just a couple of them. And apparently the Weyrlingmaster has no pleasure from those he does see, since every reference, however vague, makes his mouth twist like he's eaten something rotten. ""We drill in the morning, after breakfast. Send me notes on what you'd like to have 'em do so I can let you know if it's something they've done."" A, half-stifled snick escapes him and he adds, ""Though if it's Benden's best secrets, I'd figure it shouldn't be.""</p>
<p>I'lyan nods. ""I will."" A pause and he says, ""Should I let the Weyrleader know? He's been... concerned with the politics of the situation.""</p>
<p>R'vain snorts. ""If there's politics in a Caucus student--"" There's that derision again. ""-- teaching weyrlings formations, then they're your problem. Experience tells me Ganathon won't object t'you helping as long as it's on my watch."" And here, that cruel sneer. ""Unless he's using you for something else.""</p>
<p>I'lyan's eyes flick to the older rider's face. ""Why would you say that?"" There's a spark of suspicion in them where before he radiated supreme confidence.</p>
<p>""Because that's th'way of Weyrleaders,"" replies R'vain, as simple as that. ""When d'you think you'd be able to send notes? I don't dare get in the way of your lessons."" Teeth, startling white, between the curves of a mighty grin.</p>
<p>I'lyan laughs. ""This evening good enough? See, the problem the Caucus has is that they hand out a syllabus. Easy to get the work done days in advance."" He tries to look innocent and fails miserably. ""I'll pull the charts I brought with me from Benden and bring 'em over. After dinner?""</p>
<p>""Really? I know what my first deed would be, as an instructor,"" muses R'vain, looking far less innocent than I'lyan, but then, R'vain isn't trying. He sucks his tongue over his teeth as if he were sharpening them and replies approval with a curt nod. ""After dinner. If you like,"" and here his smirkiness, his intonation, his whole demeanor shades into something so vastly knowing and smug that it can only be an intentional sharing, an unsubtle underline with which to accentuate his words. ""I can see if th'Lady High Reaches would like t'put on klah for us.""</p>
<p>I'lyan ahs, eyes flickering with understanding and a hint of curiosity. He inclines his head. ""I'd be delighted to meet her, but it's no trouble. I'm remarkably less formal than most.""</p>
<p>R'vain coughs out a rough, gutteral laugh, satisfied. ""Trust me,"" he rumbles, ""It's all for show."" He must mean Sian's formality; he plainly possesses none of his own. ""See you then."" And though I'lyan won't know it, it is a first-time occurrence: The Reaches' Weyrlingmaster tosses off a graceless salute, as he might wave kinship to a comrade, at a Caucus student. Then he's stalking off after his weyrlings, southward bound.</p>
<p>I'lyan returns the salute as the man turns, heading towards the caverns himself. And perhaps to break the news to the Weyrleader. His expression is one of intense satisfaction and mingled relief, though at jst what is anyone's guess.</p>

"event","<p>I'lyan:<br />With a long face and high forehead, I'lyan could easily be dismissed as average on a first glance. Brown hair sprinkled liberally with sandy-blonde highlights is cut in a militaristic fashion, calling further attention to that almost abnormally high forehead. Perhaps receding hairlines run in his family. Sandy eyebrows arch over eyes of a piercing ice blue, the color of a winter lake, and there is where the casual dismissal ends. His eyes are fired with intelligence, rarely missing a detail around him. The rest of his face is chiseled out of an artist's mold: high cheekbones, a straight aquiline nose and a sharply squared chin are at odds with a full, slightly outsized mouth. His ears too are slightly outsized, but rather than appear dopey, they give him an almost endearing quality.</p>
<p>His tall, lean frame is dressed simply in well-worn riding leathers, carefully tended and oiled. On his tunic is worn the device of Benden Weyr, and at the collar, the pin denoting his attendance in the caucus. On his jacket is sewn the patch of a wingsecond, and his knot is that of a bronzeriding wingsecond of Benden Weyr.<br /><br /><br />Koriscath:<br />Precise, clean lines form this bronze. Large enough to rival many golds, his is a physical power evident in every subtle movement and gesture. The grace of steel, a flashing rapier quickness is Koriscath's signature; a thin blade tempered with mastery of sinew and bone, buried in bronze hide. From snout tip to tail tip, he shimmers with the perfection of a twilight star, the fire within lending a radiance and purity. Dark umber threads its way through the shine of his hide, darkening it down neckridges and across sharply boned spars, spreading dusky night down through his sails. A sloped muzzle with low, short headknobs frames large, jeweled eyes, perfect to inspire secret confidences. Koriscath is endowed with a strong jaw, a perfect compliment to his lean neck and long, whipcord tail. </p>
<p>Koriscath is 12 turns, 1 month old and 71 feet long. He is 35 feet tall at the shoulder and has a wingspan of 106 feet.</p>"

"event","<div class=""ljcut"" text=""See the bright shiny thing? Don't worry, it won't hurt. Much.""><strong>Plot Hooks:</strong><br />o There is absolutely no reason for I'lyan to be at the caucus. He has enough experience to teach classes, not be a student. A wingsecond in M'arik's wing at Benden, it is obvious he's being groomed to be his replacement. What he's doing here at the Caucus, when M'arik has been so opposed to it, is anyone's guess.<br /><br />o He's unbelievably Traditional, and rather completely devoted to Benden Weyr. Even going so far as to dismissing girls from standing, believing they have no place in fighting wings.<br /><br />o The boy Illyan and his mother Elli, all but disappeared from High Reaches Hold during turnover the year Illyan was 5. None of their family knew where they went.<br /><br />o I'lyan's mother gave closed testimony at the Instigator trial, rigorously protected by M'arik.</div>

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""The Seecrud Info""><strong>Secrets:</strong><br />1) Illyan's mother, Elli, is Derek's younger sister. She never got along with her brother, who she charitably described as a bully. Their relationship was characterized by abuse, both verbal and physical. Their father died when Elli was twelve, and she rushed into marriage with Ronal at fifteen in order to escape Derek. So she thought. Ronal was also a guard at HRH, and in Derek's unit. She strongly suspected that Derek was bringing Ronal into underhanded dealings. When Illya was five, Ronal's neck was broken in a 'riding accident' when he was out patrolling the borders with Derek. Adlen, Diya's brother and a childhood friend of Elli's, spoke to her not long after Ronal's death. Though Elli suspected Derek to be involved, she had no proof. And now Derek was her guardian, and the guardian of the 5 turn old Illyan. Desperate to escape HRH, she appealed to Adlen, who spoke to Diya and Lord Memias on her behalf. Ronal's mother was at Lemos Hold. And M'tai, Diya's bronzerider friend at HRW had obscure ties to the Hold, so his going wouldn't be that remarkable. The escape was authorized, with Diya taking Elli and Illyan to High Reaches Weyr, and M'tai then transferring them to Lemos Hold.<br /><br />2) Illya met his uncle again at Benden Weyr when he was a weyrling. Elli never told him her suspicions of his uncle, and the boy was overjoyed to be reunited, showing him all around the weyr. Derek used Illya's idealism to procure the Benden Weyr knots used later in the instigators raiding. After his graduation in turn 190 and the subsequent raid, Illya spoke to M'arik about his suspicions that Derek may have been involved. M'arik managed to keep his name out of it by allowing Elli to testify that she was at the weyr, visiting her son, and saw Derek steal the knots. As a result, Derek knows exactly who gave him up, and is disgusted with his bronzeriding nephew, ready to get a tidy helpng of revenge if the opportunity presents itself.<br /><br />3) Illya is highly ambitious, always worried about the spectre of his family rearing its head. Only M'arik, Elli and Diya know of his family ties. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, M'arik has been grooming Illya as his adjutant under the adage of 'keep your enemies closer' or perhaps 'blood will tell'. M'arik sent Illya to the caucus to find out how effective it was, keep tabs on Ginella, and to undermine its progress if the opportunity was ripe.<br /></div>"

"event","Born to Elli and Ronal of High Reaches Hold, Illyan spent only five turns in the frosty hold. Upon his father's death, his mother moved to Lemos Hold, staying with Ronal's mother and working as a seamstress. Illya was getting ready to apprentice to the smithcraft when he was searched out of Lemos for one of Fayaleth's clutches. Only thirteen, he didn't impress, but stayed on at the weyr to be presented at the next clutch where bronze Koriscath found him on the sands. since then the pair have enjoyed a heady ride, climbing quickly to wingleader, and then placed as a second wingsecond in M'arik's wing after Koriscath proved himself by flying Lamre's gold a second time. It's obvious that this young man is one of the ones M'arik is grooming to replace him as Weyrleader when the time comes.<br /><br />

<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Full Public History""><strong>Character History:</strong><br />Illya's childhood was fairly unremarkable. He rarely discusses it. When he does, he simply says he was birthed at High Reaches Hold, raised at Lemos by his mother and grandmother after his father's death. Illya was never a troublesome child, though he was usually the one behind the scenes. When the feeder stream for the washing caverns was found dammed up, his playmates were the ones in trouble, though it was Illya that masterminded the building of the dam. When half the hay was removed from the loft for diving into the pile below, it was again his playmates who had the punishment. Not Illya, who had begun the game in the first place. Though such was his friendly openness that no one ever begrudged him his lack of punishment, nor ever ratted him out. Besides, if he got in trouble, who would think up all the fun things to do in the meantime<br /><br />His mother insisted he consider apprenticing where he would much rather have gone into the Hold guards. So after eyeing the various crafters in the hold, he settled on the smithcraft. He was packing to leave that sevenday when a search wing came from Benden. Rounded up with the other hold youngsters, he was the only lad to be taken in search, much to the chagrin of his former playmates.<br />Candidacy was unremarkable, primarily because Illya was too intimidated by being in a weyr to return to his former ringleader status. Hatching day came and went, and Illya was left standing. When asked if he wanted to return to Lemos, he replied that instead, he'd like to be considered for the next clutch at Benden. To keep him out of trouble he was put to work as an assistant to the weyr smiths, primarily a fetch-and-carry duty, building up the fires, and in general, keeping him too busy for much of anything else. When Fayaleth rose again, Illya was presented as a candidate. And just after he turned fifteen, bronze Koriscath found him on the sands.<br /><br />Weyrlinghood was no major difficulty for the young pair, and this ease in his training apparently gained him the eye on M'arik not long after he graduated. Placed first in the wings, Koriscath surprised everyone and caught Lamre's gold when he was only four turns of age. I'lyan proved adept at spotting troublemakers in the candidates brought in, and was put to work helping to settle the young men down, weeding out the difficult ones. Several girls were sent packing when he was in charge of the candidates, accused of pregnancy during candidacy. Rumor has it he terrified them with tales of the Pass-to-be and scared them out of standing. Regardless, the weyrling classes to come out of his tenure of 'babysitting' were exceptional ones, and M'arik shoved him back in the wings, this time as a wingleader.<br /><br />I'lyan and Koriscath seemed unbeatable as wingleaders. They were often given the newly graduated weyrlings to whip into shape. The pair were particularly hard on female greenriders. When assignments after graduation were handed out, more than one greenrider requested a transfer before ever even reporting to I'lyan. It's true that he demanded far more of the female riders in his wing, often setting them punishing PT schedules compared to more lax ones for the men, but riders from his wing were highly sought in all of Benden's wings.<br /><br />After Koriscath captured Lamre's gold a second time, M'arik again took a hand in the pair's fate. They were transferred to his wing as a controvertial 'second' wingsecond. The acknowledged weyrsecond was M'arik's age and though still a hale man, he was beginning to show signs of slowing down. Many began to speculate: did this denote M'arik's endorsement of I'lyan as his replacement when the time came? The Pass was soon to begin, Jannali's Fayaleth was starting to slow down, and Koriscath was already a favorite of Lamre's gold. There was a great deal of muttering among the female greenriders after this. Reportedly, grievances were taken to Jannali, and nothing ever came of it.<br /><br />There was an undercurrent of relief when Ginella's Aneleth was caught by another bronze in her maiden flight. Most of the good marks were on Koriscath, but at the last moment he seemed to lose his bid. Some wags wagered that it was because Illya didn't want Lamre to doubt his loyalty, others that he wanted to avoid an entanglement should Jannali step down, as the Pass was immanent. Still, it was rumored that Koriscath /should/ have had Aneleth, which did little to endear him to the other bronzeriders fighting for M'arik's attention.<br /><br />Traditionalist that M'arik is, Benden was well ready to meet thread when it began to fall. As one of his 'seconds, I'lyan was often taking ground crew reports, and began to be a familiar figure to holder and crafter after falls. the pair have thus far escaped injury, as has the majority of their wing.<br /><br />With things going so well, most of Benden was surprised when I'lyan was abruptly shipped out to attend the Caucus at High Reaches Weyr, not long after Ginella's Aneleth hatched her second clutch. While T'ral's departure to High Reaches was almost a foregone conclusion, this took the weyr by surprise. Have M'arik and Illya had a falling out? Or is this to cement Illya in the minds of Benden's riders as M'arik's endorsed successor? Or better yet, as some darker rumors go, is this a ploy to wrest leadership of the Reaches to a Benden born rider? For many could argue that the charismatic bronzer hardly needs *teaching* and in fact could be an instructor in his own right. Yet his detractors, other bronze and some green riders at Benden, say that some polish might even out the chauvenism he shows in his leadership.<br /></div>
<div class=""ljcut"" text=""Hobbies, etc""><br /><strong>Hobbies, etc:</strong><br />First and foremost in Illya's life is Koriscath. The dark hued bronze is his constant companion and advisor. The pair are two peas in a pod, so alike that at times it is difficult to tell who is doing the thinking: the dragon or the rider. Still, he has a few close friends: Lamre, quite obviously, as well as some of the other bronzeriders at Benden. He's often found in the evenings relaxing at cards. A gentleman's card player, he wins more than he loses, but never to excess. Something always keeps people coming back to play with him. Likewise at gathers and holidays, he's always surrounded by a group of maleriders and can be found betting on the ponies if there are races. A true man's man, but at the same time, many of the caverns women at benden would describe him as the perfect big brother: protective, and with a broad set of shoulders to cry on. Despite his success, he seems well liked, save where there is an obvious grievance against his rapid rise to rank. Much like his childhood, he seems to be a loveable ringleader, rarely in gossip, but often on the edges of it.<br /></div>"

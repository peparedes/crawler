"event","well now its been a long time since the last time I got to my computer to write nothing has really changed accept my parents are starting to have a little bit more faith in me when it comes to the car I mean like they are letting me take it out on little shopping trips and shit basically their bitch work but hey you know what if helps me get the car sooner then bring on the bitch work.  lauren really fucked me and sarah last week by getting pissed off at vince she got pissed at vince and as a result she told his parents this whole big thing about me and sarah being too sexual and us having sex in front of him and now we are not allowed at his house or to hang out with him so when we do we have to be careful.  So that is that story and school well that is pretty well I dont know how to explain school its school and I am sure most of everybody can realte to that statement.  Sarah thinks that I shouldnt be upset or broken hearted if she ever came to me and told me that she has a crush on another person and we got into this huge like discution about it I think that thinking someone is cute and having a crush on them are 2 completely different things and she thinks that they are the same the conversation couldnt help but bring the thought into my head that she does have a crush on someone else but wanted to see if it was not a good thing if she told me or whatever so hey give me your oppinion do you think that I should be upset if she were to tell me or do you think I have a right to be.  well I guess I am going to cut this right here and write later."

"event","well its been a long time since I last wrote I think because I just lately havent had the desire to do much of anything I dont know whatever it is.  well a lot has happened yesterday I went to go see the alkaline trio show at the chakadero or how ever you spell it and it was pretty good I deff fell in love with them and the eyeliners they fucking rock but towards the end of the night when hot water musoc was playing I think I broke or sprained my ribs I was against the gate and then the crowd rushed and when I hit the gate hard I heard my chest crack like hard core and so me and sarah got out and went to the back and then she went back in and I thought well she didnt have the camera so I went back in and got some snap shots for her and when I got back she was fuckin pissed cause apparently she only went in for the one song and by then my fucking chest hurt like a bitch so it was just bad she was all upset and said I ruined her night which I almost told her to go find herself a boyfreind that wouldnt do that to her I fucking went through some extreme fuckin pain so she would have some pictures and all I got was fuck you you ruined my night so that was that.  um what else of I am really fucking mad at my parents I got told by my mom that I was a disapointment and shit like that today and I brought in a kitten that basically got the boot out of the house right away and I really really wanted that cat like sooooooo bad you have no idea and nobody has faith that I could take care of it not even sarah which really really bothers me I dont know why but it really does.  and for now I think that is all the trauma on the up side school starts not tommorow but the day after that and I kinda really cant wait and tommorow I get some back to school supplies and stuff yey me."

I am in some debt and because of it I cant do for sarah what she wants she wants to go to ladyfest and I cant take her cause I dont have the money how much does that fucking suck I even really was looking forward to go but mostly cause I wanted to make sarah happy.  I told sarah that if it wasnt for her then I would be gay and she took it badly, I guess I could see why but I didnt mean it like that you know I meant like she fulfills me in ways that nobody ever has but whatever.  god I love that girl and i just want to make her smile hey if anybody has any ideas please leave them I need some please."

"event","wow what a past couple of days.  I mean a in a good way though yesterday me and sarah had sex, well let me just start there I have never in my life had sex that fulfilling, see I am really bisexual to the point where I think I mean I know that if me and sarah broke up then I would deff. just go gay, but as of right now I mean the way me and sarah are turning out we are going to be together for a long time.  anyway we tried some new things yesterday and I am not going to tell you what they are but lets just say that I dont want to give sarahs vibrator back.  um I found out that laurens parents are not going to be around this weekend so me and sarah are moving in there for the weekend and on top of that I found out that my whole family is going all the way up pa to kanobles or some place for a family trip that I am not going to go on so that means that noone is going to be at my house from tuesday untill saturday well my house is being turned into a sex dungen.  oh and I got paid today so I am now more then halfway out of debt another couple of weeks and Ill be debt free, go me.  well thats all for now I am at sarahws house so I think I am going to go pay attention to her for now."

"event","I talked to sarah this morning because she was mad at me cause I was upset, pissed off or mad whatever you want to say, at her and I think that I am to involved with her I think that she centers my life to much you know what I mean.  I love her to death but like I walk to her house and from her house all the time just becuse I want to see her not for any other reason and not once will she ever exert that kind of energy because we just dont live that close together.  or like if I decided not to go to the beach she would of went anyway, if it were me I would of stayed behind cause she would of been alone, dont get me wrong I am not saying this because I am trying to make her look bad or anything cause she is great to me the only reason I am saying it is because I think I need to calm down to kind of back off a little maybe we just shouldnt have sex anymore cause she thinks that if she didnt give it to me then we would break up and I dont like that cause sex or no sex I love her more then any person I have ever met in my life I dont know what to do.  whatever I just really needed her today and she just wasnt there for me although I guess I deserve it cause I wasnt around for her when I was working at camp so its all justifyable today really fucking sucks I just want a hug but I have nobody."

"event","it was quite a day I went to work at 8 this morning and was there untill 3:00.  While I was there I wrote sarah a letter cause I thought it would be kinda sweet cause lord knows I love to get stuff in the mail so I thought Id make someone else smile.  well went to sarahs house mostly just sat around for most of the rest of the day, then we went to rent a movie ""I am just a cheerleader"" or somthing like that and when we first started whatching it tiffany called and threatened to sue us because of the accident me and sarah got in where sarah used tiffs name, consider I didnt exactly talk her out of it I just went along with it, then after I made sarah stop crying and made her smile just basically cheered her up we started whatching the movie again but very soon after vince and lauren came over so we watched the movie all together it was a really really cute movie deff recomend it to everyone that enjoys gays and gay rights and stuff.  well after the movie was over I invited sarah to come over tommorow and we could hang out at my house for the day or whatever I just really need her around.  well that got ugly real quick she doesnt want to come over tommorow and see me even though I could get her a ride to my house and back with no trouble what so ever.  my mom said she would love to get her and all but sarah said that she felt bad making my parents escort her around whatever I think I am just asking to much I am just being a greedy boyfreind I know I am being wrong but I just really need her around I mean its not like I just want her around to have sex either cause I know thats what she thinks I wont have sex with her at all I just want her to be around and she isnt going to be well thats what happens when you expect to much from people I know I am just being an asshole.  hey and then when I got home I found out the computer that I let a few of my freinds borrow yeah they broke it there goes 1500 bucks fuck it whatever I am going to go catch some sleep, I am going to sleep in tommorow then call my lawyer and insurance and then go to work come home and just go to sleep or something Ill check in tommorow maybe sometime."

"event","You know some people search there whole lives for that one person that is going to change everything, that is going to make everything all better that when you wake up in the morning they are the first thing that you think about and when you go to sleep at night they are the last thing that you think about.  I had a conversation with sarah tonight (well I should say last night but it was just like 2 hours ago) that was amazing we talked and talked and I listened to everything she had to say and she listened to everything I had to say, well the point is that is was amazing my god I have never talked to someone so long and so intencely in my whole life I mean no one has ever touched me with words like that in my life I felt so, god I dont even know the word for it all I know is she finally told me exactly what I needed to hear finally after everything that is what I needed, is to know that not only does she love me unconditionally but everything that I do for her everything that I go through all the crap is worth it, it is appreciated.  She said that she has been spoiled by me she has never been in a relationship and treated so well before.  All the inatiquacies that I had or might of had were just thrown out the window.  She said I was the most romantic boy that, you know what I feel like I am on cloud 1 billion (if there is a cloud) its totally official written in gold or somthing I am pathetically head over heals in love I am a love sick puppy dog and I am happy to be alive it was the most wonderful thing I have ever experienced in my life.  wow was it a turn on too I have never felt more sexy more willing to give my soul to another human being in my life it was amazing.
     ok the beach Ill talk about that for a minute what a time I ended up skipping work calling out sick and just going to the beach and I am glad I did I needed that we were there untill we just couldnt move anymore we got there around 7:00 in the morning and left around I guess 7:00 at night we didnt spend that much prob around 40 bucks which isnt that bad considering I am a huge impulse buyer I mean huge.  we laid in the sun and went into the water untill we looked like giant raisons and walked around until it wasnt phisically possible for us to anymore.  it was great it was like the perfect day and as freinds it was probably a moment I will never forget (of course I am a huge sap so it was even more special for me then anybody else)."

"event","I have this huge conflict see I have right now a job just for the next few weeks cause I am helping out my old boss cause he is in a pinch at the present time, I want to go to the beach with sarah and vince and lauren but I have to work that day and it looks like because everybody is on vacation that I wont be able to go but this is somthing I have been looking forward to do since god the beginigh of the summer, to watch the sun set at the beach or just relax at the beach while the sun sets with sarah.  You see I love water I love the ocean more then almost anything in the whole world because you can talk to it and it listens you can kool off in it you can just listen to it talk to you its beautiful, and I wanted to share that with sarah just once before it got to cold out before we got to buisy I just wanted to take a day and go out on a trip to the beach.  I gave sarah an attitude a lot today not intentionally mostly because I was dissapointed that I would not be able to go, I think just a small part of me wants her to stay and wait for me untill I get off work and we could spend time at the beach another time cause vince and lauren want to go another time before the summer is over.  but I do not want her to miss out of somthing that I myself would absolutely love to attend although I have to be honest I am a freek and if I were in sarahs possition I would not go on the trip only because like I said I am a freek.  am I wrong because I think like that I know that it sounds a little selfish but whatever I just want to be there with her I think what I am going to do is just call out sick from work and go on the fucking trip I know that I wont get fired from the job they rely on me to much and if I left they would be so screwed its not like I am a bad worker there I worked there 1 ful year and was one of the best damn workers they ever had thats what they told me I only messed up once that whole time and that was just I was a little late to work.  so I think that is what I am going to do but I am not going to tell sarah I think I am going to make it a suprise."

"event","you know I am starting this because the girlfreind said that I should start like a hobby or somthing because lately I have been an asshole.  I have been going out with a girl for a little over 6 months she is the most wonderful person I have ever met in my life, she has helped me come out with a person that I have been keeping inside myself for my whole teenage life.  Brought up in a world where racism, homophobia, sexism, just general hatred to anything that isnt you was part of everyday life and not understanding why I was a very confused boy.  She helped me answer all those questions that I had and understand what I was.  I have been gone working at a camp for pretty much the whole summer which put a large strain on somthing that I have never been so sure of in my life, there are still questions and things that I dont like that I will never get an answer to or get an explanation for that I would like but never will recieve such as why she had to seek out another boy to literally replace me untill I returned even though she said would never happen.  We have been going through I guess you could say rocky times because I have been lost in myself mostly because of these things but I would never say anything, why I dont know maybe I am waiting for somthing.  I think that I am way to attached to a person that just doesnt see what suffer through just to make them happy, granted I dont mind I would suffer through hell just to make her smile, I love her so much sometimes I dont know if she sees that well I think I shold get some sleep I have to wake up for work in like 4 hours"

I love the girl to death but I am unable to take it anymore I need that affection that she doesnt want to show me. 
I have started to, whenever I feel the need to pull her close and kiss her or hug her and give her all the affection I can, I just push her away and ignore her as best I can of course she notices this and thinks there is somthing wrong but I just tell her I am thinking or somthing cause if I tell her the truth then she will just yell at me and tell me why she cant be in a relationship right now and blah blah blah.  friday night I am seeing if I can get a date with this girl emily cause I need that affection even if it is from a girl I dont know I need it, I dont know why I just do and if this is the only way to get it then so be it."

"event","wow its been a long time since I last wrote I think that I just got confused about a lot of stuff hey guess what me and sarah broke up well kinda I mean its not like we are seeing other people or anything.  you see I mean like we were saposed to have sex tonight but that never happened cause I didnt want to make her do somthing like that after its been quite a while if she wasnt totally into it.  I dont know I love her to death and everything it just seems that she doesnt love me the same if at all, not because she wont have sex with me not at all, just that she pays more attention to other people now and she doesnt want to spend time with me the way she used to she said that she feels like she has to spend time with me how horrible is that when she said that to me it took every once of control I had not to totally walk out of her life and never look back and that was the first time I had that feeling and it worries me.  see she looks at other boys and tells me how she would love to do that boy or something totally out of the blue and I feel like the only reason she does it is to make me jealous I have never been a jealous boy befor because I hate the emotion and what it makes us as humans do.  I can honestly say that yeah there are girls in our school that I may think fondley of but to the extent to say that I think they are prettier then sarah let alone wanting to get down their pants is totally obserd.  I dont want to make myself out to be the total good guy in this whole thing cause I am not that I have my faults just as everybody else and believe me sarah lets them known to me as often as she can it seems, but I feel as though I am being taken advantage of.  take for example I pick up her freind to go to a party (who doesnt live anywhere close to us at all) dont ask for gas money even though I am very poor and extremely in debt (from her none the less) and I dont even get a thankyou oh wait I did from the girl who was very polite and extremely nice.  or how I take her to her freinds house in new jersey (hour ride) of course I came along but she resented that so much and that girl was also very nice I really liked her and her, we will just call him her partner but they are not a couple from what I gather.  
I dont want to loose her cause of the way she makes me feel sometimes and the way she just makes me generally happy every once in a while.  I mean she is really great I want to do so much for her I just dont want it all to go unappreciated.
on the upside I have gotten away from not eating and throwing up what I do eat I decided its not worth her yelling at me about and so instead I started taking these pills they increase my energy they lower my apitite and they really make me concentrate which it doesnt say they do but they do.  I am not going to tell sarah because I know she would just get mad at me and yell for the ammount of them I have to take a day 6 I have to take 2 in the morning 2 in the early afternoon and 2 to put me to sleep at night its not so bad they are just really big.  ok well I guess you are going to see a lot more of me writing so Ill catch you later if anybody does read this."

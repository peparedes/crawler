"event","Thanks to Nick, i now feel the need to update.  How long has it been since i've updated?  Umm...i'm going to go with 2 months.  Or maybe thats an exaggeration.  Either way, any time i think about updating a sadistic little voice in my head says, ""Whats the point?  All the people who you really care about and who care about you already know whats going on in your life"".  But then, maybe YOU dont....so, fair reader, i'll write. 

Hi.  My name is Amy and i'm a Portlander.  Port-lar-die-er.  er, whatever.  I live in the rainy city (or is that seattle...oh well).  It rains alot and i love it.  My hair is ridiculously curly 99% of the time and im slowly learning to deal with it.  Most days its dark at 1 in the afternoon, because the beautiful sky is delicatly frosted with clouds.  And i love it.  However, more winter clothes are in order.  Freakin California...youve not prepared me for this.  It gets cold here too.  Real cold.  Like 30 degrees (insert shiver).  
However most of my days are spent indoors.  I work at Meier and Frank (soon to be Macys...dang you corprate monster) and happily spend my days selling far too scadelous clothing to very young teenagers and very old ""cool"" old ladies (insert shiver).  I live with 3 girls and we have good times drinking hot cocoa and watching the first and second season of arrested development (best show EVER).  But the highlite of every week is going to the church to hang out with the middle schoolers.  Oh yea, just call me a middle school leader, cause thats what i am.  And i love it.  Jr Highers are the best people ever!  I love how super akward everything is with them...it makes me laugh.  And all they want is to be loved, and thats the least i can give them.  
Lets see....hmmm..what else. Oh! I dont have a car anymore.  I got in a car wreck about a two months ago and my car was totalled.  So now i have a nice settlement check but no car.  But i really dont mind it.  I just take the bus everywhere.  Yup, i'm a bus kid.  Portland has AMAZING public transport (california could take a few lessons).  The buses go everywhere and i dont mind not having a car. Its actually rather freeing.  And is alot cheeper.  So now you say, ""well genius, why dont you use the money and buy a new car"".  Well...i could do that or i could leave the country.  I think i'll go with the latter.  Maybe austria for 3 months or france for 6.  
Does that sum up my life?  How can i adequately explain the daily highs and lows...defeats and conquers...frustrations and joys of my life.  Above all else, CHRIST is my joy, my sucess, my shelter from the rain.  No one else hears me when i cry.  No one else has carved my name in their hand.  No one else knew me before i was created.  And this is the same Christ calling out YOUR name....
THAT is my LIFE"

We moved into our wonderful apartment last week, and i just got a job at Meier & Frank (Translation for californians: Think J.C. Pennys).  Anyways, its a good job, good pay, good benifits, ect.  Truly a blessing.  I love Portland.  Always so much to do at any hour.  I love the energy of big cities.  
For now, however, i'm in california for a mini-""vacation"" (yeah...right...).  I'll be here till wednesday and will try my best to visit friends.  
Nothing else to report.  The Lord is good."

"event","Its a rainy tuesday in the great northwest...bright clouds encompass the sky and the tiniest drops fall on my nose.  Its august and i'm happily snuggled in a hoodie.  Yup, thats why i love oregon.  Summer days have been good.  Long...oh, so encredibly long, but good.  As a task driven father once suggested, hard work builds character.  I beleive thats true.  But man, i'm tired.  I'm tired of cleaning up things that will only be messy in five minutes.  I'm tired of feeding people who will only be satisfied for a few hours (or less, in the case of ravenous teenage boys) and will come back from you wanting more.  But what if you feel you dont have more?  I think thats why God made the summer only 3 months long.  Long enough to relax and vacation, or to work hard and make money, depending on your social status...but not so long that you forget the winter...and not so long that the tourists kill the servants.  
  One month from today i'll be done with cannon beach.  (insert big sigh).  Havent been to california in 6 months.  nother big sigh.  I'm praying for you all, even when you dont want my prayers"

Been thinking a little about owning a coffee shop or maybe just managing one.  Its not at all glamourous or lucrative (sp?...i dont know...i dropped out of college)....But i find that the less ""successful"" the job, the more content i am.  I think i might be ""mediocre"" for the rest of my life...and i think that would be ok. I'm content.  God is so good.

"event","April is almost here and again i'm stuck with the guilty reminder that i should update.  Here goes.  Life is swell.  It rains very much...but then i should learn to accept that by now since i live in oregon.  School is good, though it is almost over.  The worst part of school ending is the kind of senioritis that has set in.  Its hit pretty much all the students.  We all slug around and try not to sleep during class.  All of which is terribly discouraging since 5 months ago we were wide awake with enthusiasm and energy.  What happened?  Still its all good.  I wake up in the morning, most mornings, with a smile on my face because my life is pleasant.  
  Highlight of the last few months...i met someone.  His name is Joel and he is great.  Nothing official, just taking our time.  He's visiting tomorrow.  I cant begin to explain how refreshing it is to have someone pursue you for you alone, not what you can give or do.  He makes me happy.
  Future plans?  I'm working for the conference center (again? ... I know).  Which means, (sorry californians) that i wont be darkening your doorstep for who knows how long.  Christmas?   Maybe longer.  How strange to look back on a life that was once so familiar and is now a blurry dream."

"event","Rain.  So much rain that you wonder whether torential floods are truly more likely than the ever hyped tunami, which according to the newspaper should hit any moment.  .... nope didnt hit....wait....nope still didnt.  
  Life is good.  We run between buildings from activity to activity, till we realize that there is not that much to do and drift onto a couch to vedge and think about how good the simple life is.  And some dont run to class, but stroll, or even stand and watch it fall.  Like those who would run to the beach to see the tunami, passionate with greater understanding than those clawing up the hill.  
  Yesterday, or perhaps it was the day before, James said to me ""take it easy"" and i responded as fluidly as the moisture around me ""dont worry i will.  i dropped out of college, remember?  Life is simple, so i will.""

  Christmas break was ok, i'm just glad its over.  That life isnt my life anymore, so it was weird to be there again.

"event","I've been in california for about a week...and now i'm thinkin, when can i leave?  Its been cool though, dont get me wrong, its just been simply tumultuous (look it up in a dictionary smart kid).  First thing i did when i got in was see my friends from college.  That was cool-- It was like no time had passed at all and it was all of us just hanging out like always.  Then i saw my family...it had been 6 months, so seeing them was good. My little brother has gained about 20 lbs, yikes!  hes cute still but a little on the chunky side.  But as cool as all of that was, when i'm falling asleep that night in the living room (because as is a common tragidy, my room has become ""the office"", and no way am i sleeping in the black pit that is my brothers room) all i can think about is CB...wished i could just go back right away, to see the familiar faces and walk the familiar streets.  I dont know where God will take me after ecola, but right now i'm thinking, How can i ever leave CB--it is the ONLY place i have ever known of as HOME.  sigh.  but i know i cant stay there forever, and i'm sure that God has bigger and better, and thus, my quandry.  sigh, again. 
  I spent a week in norcal, catching up with family and friends.  It wasnt too bad...my family fought, of  course, but not that much.  Then, FINALLY my sister came! she stayed for a few days and then i went home with her yesterday-- which means im in LA right now...oh yeah.  i know, you're jelous.  LA is cool.  Unlike certain sleepy beach towns, this town doesnt shut down at 10pm, so there is always tons to do.  Its good to be here and good to be with my sister.
  I'm praying for all my brothers and sisters and i hope you'll pray for me too.  As much as this is fun and relaxing, it is far from a vacation--> THIS is the battlefield.  ....I'm sure you understand."

Should i inform friends back home of my minute to minute activities...none of which you care about...all of which are a futile attempt to recapture friendships that fade with each passing day.  call me a realist.
  Tonight i get to leave cb and go to portland-- super happy about that.  I love this place..but honestly i live for the moments when i get to drive away from it.  Leaving makes coming back so refreshing and exiting...like it was when i first got here 5 months ago.  And, i love portland.  Hey, maybe i'll live there someday.  Or maybe seattle.  Or maybe i'll move to michigan (actually...i might do that...hmmmm...).  Theres a bible college in michigan that i'm seriously concidering going to.  It would allow me to go straight to the mission feild...and the school is dirt cheap.  But michigan is soooo far away.  I dont know...we'll see how that goes.  Dont think my family would ever forgive me for moving so far away.

Some are very nice, some even intreiging...but there is a whole group i am hesitant to get to know.  The bad thing about starting up school (even though this isnt an ""academic school"" per se) is that i am busy.  Oh well.  The weather is crazy...its been raining for about a week solid...no joke.  24 hours a day, 6 days a week.  rain.  It makes you super grateful for that one day-even one half hour- of sunshine.

The three of us just happened to get 3 days off of work after working for 10 days straigh (pulling 10-12 hour days).  Anne and i drove up in Matt's BMW...which is a beautiful car.  Seattle is amazing-  I think i decided that if i want to move to a big city it would be this one.  Earlier today we went to this place called Pike Place market, and it reminded me so much of fishermans warf...but it has a different feel than frisco.  Anne said that this is definetly a ""starving artist"" town and she could be a starving artist here...and i think i feel the same way.  Puget Sound is beautiul...so strange to see a body of water right in the middle of a city.  The sky line is beautiful, and later we hope to see the space needle up close.  
  It feels so good to get away from Cannon Beach.  Dont get me wrong, i love it there, but it wears on you to be there for too long.  I live in a bubble there (we call it the ""conference center bubble"") which is comforting but it is nice to be exposed to the real world.

But now, one of the guys here has a computer in his room and he is a computer guy, so he figured out how to pirate the internet acess...woohoo for computer nerds!  Anyways, so i'm sitting here in his room, trying to catch up with those who i've left in cali.  Incidently, me being in his room is a ""no-no""- no girls in guys dorms- but the rules are not really in effect right now and, well, we're rule breakers.  
  Hows life, you ask?  Good.  Different.  All of the summer staff left, which means that our staff off 125 people is reduced to 40.  This means that i am working almost double the hours, working in different departments...ect.  I work 10 hour days and 6 day weeks.  I would be rejoycing for large paychecks...but that doesnt really happy here.  So instead i'll be happy because i'm staying to busy to be depressed because so many of my friends are gone.  I'm not working in the kitchen anymore.  Now i work in housekeeping, which is alot of fun, but tough on the body, and in waitstaff which is mentally stressful because of the direct interactions with the guests.  But i love my co-workers; they really do make it or break it.  When you get to make beds for 2 hours with your best friend (a girl named Sarah Hill, who has become the sunshine in my day)...there is nothing like it. Also, summer staff leaving means that there is nothing to do, which is great since now i get more than 5 hours of sleep at night! yay!  
  The weather is nuts here.  At 8 am it was cloudy, 10 am was sunny and hot, 1pm was pouring, and now its partially cloudy with a beautiful sunset peeking through.  Its funny...i dont think i ever noticed the sunsets in california....was it the crowded skyline, or was it my crowded life?  I've never watched the sunsets and stars as much as i have here this summer...how inspiring and invigorating it all is...makes you feel alive.  The other night we had a storm here and a group of 5 of us decided to go on the beach and check it out.  It was amazing!  The tide was up so far and the water was fierce and deep.  The wind was strong and was picking up so much sand that it stung my legs and quickly covered fresh footsteps.  
  Ecola (bible school) starts in less than a month!  i cant wait to meet all the new students and begin classes.  I still dont have enough money, but am trusting in God that i will.  
  Work is stressful sometimes, and its so easy to get tired...but i feel like new when i put my life in perspective:
         I am here, in Cannon Beach, the place i cried for for the last year...i work in ministry, serving tired people of God in need a retreat...i live at the beach, enough said...i live with a large group of people my age who have quickly become my best friends...and i am going to bible school, which is what i've wanted for so long.  Suddenly the stress of the day seems minor and i cant deny the fact that life is good."

  I am having a good time though, dispite the gloomy weather.  Many of the staff will be leaving in 3 weeks and thats sad...but i'm just trying to live it up till they leave.

People here mock me because they say i'm the whitest Californian that they know (incidently, they dont know many).  There is nothing that annoys me more than oregonians/washingtonians who say ""oh man, i want to move to california so bad"".  What they really mean is ""i want to move to sothern california where the weather is warm and the oppurtunities are great""-- basically they are going off of stereotypes and gross generalizations...which annoys me.  One guy i met last year said ""So, what is it like living in California?  Is it like crazy all the time""?  Such a dork....
Lately the days are filled with drama...sadly, mostly surrounding guys.  Beyond my own silly boy-troubles, all of my friends have issues.  Its cool, i understand...but when i get tired (which happens easily here) i have little patience for it.   Ugh.  Actually i started a fellowship group (dont laugh, anthony-- its not a cult!) with two girls here.  We are all so consumed by guys and we are all in a place in our lives where we want to seek out something else and be consumed with someone else.  So we pray for eachother and get together to talk/read the bible every few days.  Its helping alot...but still, every day is a challange....
I've been thinking of my Cali friends alot today...like Anthony, Danielle, Jaq, Heather, and of course my Sister.  I told everyone that i would visit in september...but i got my paycheck today, which means that unless i win the lottery, i wont be in the state until christmas.  Oh well.  Sorry everyone...

Life in CB is good.  Nearly perfect.  Work is going really well.  I fit right back in.  The hours are brutal (6am-3pm), but i really do enjoy what i do.  I've met so many amazing people here-- and i cant even explain how much i loved seeing my old friends.  The weather here is nice-- generally sunny, with frequent clouds, ect.  But regardless of the weather, the sunsets are always to die for.  Beautiful.  The beach is 2 blocks from my room, so i frequently watch the sun set on the beach.  The amount of streams of light blow the imagination, and i'm always astonished at how gorgeous it is...suddenly so many other things in life pale in comparison.  
Of course there are many bonfires here- nearly every night.  Many good times are had.  But as a result i've taken up the (bad) habit of sleeping 4 hours a night and napping in the day....brutal, but you only live once.  
In short, i am happy.  So content.  My heart is full...and i wish you all could be here too...."

"event","The last few days have been a mess.  I had my last day at work, and they threw me a mini-party.  It was pretty cool- I was really touched because i didnt think they would do that for me.  It was weird saying goodbye because i knew i wouldnt see them again but, it felt so surreal.  So now i have no more work, and i've just been chillin in Dixon, counting the minutes till i leave.  I've been hanging out with Hans alot...he really is a good friend, and i'm so bored here that hanging out with him is so much fun.  Friday night we drove around with Brandon for hours, and then, after we dropped Brandon off, Hans and I stayed up until 2:30am together.  We talked for hours.  I was really proud of myself, since we've been keeping up this friendship really well without complicating it with fooling around.  Its funny though, because just when i'm at that point, he finally gets interested.  He said that he wishes i didnt have to go, and that he thinks i'm one of his best friends.  He said, ""I just feel bad because your like a puzzle and i had started putting some peices toghether in october but then i got bored.  But now i'm putting more of them toghether and i'm thinking, 'Wow, this is pretty cool'--but now the puzzle box is leaving me!""
It was so cute--he really is such a dork, but i was touched by his sincerity.  Saturday night we went with Brandon to go to Lake Berryessa.  We went swimming in the dark in our underwear.  It was so much fun!  The water was suprizingly warm, and we were having a good time just playing around in the water.  Later, we dropped Brandon off and Hans took me to the country.  We went to a golf course (at 1am) and he brought out a sleeping bag.  He laid it out on the green, and we watched the stars and talked.  I saw my first shooting star- it was beautiful!  When i saw it, he asked me if i made a wish, and i hadnt, so i quickly thought one up- though in my head it came out more to be a scrambled mix of thoughts about him and Nick and hoping everything goes alright.  We got really cold lying there on the sleeping bag, so he got the great idea to squish in with me and zip it up.  Hahaha, it was so funny--it almost didnt zip up because of his ghetto booty, but we made it work.  So there we were: entirely squished together-every body part touching.  But, even still, i wasnt interested in doing anything.  I really had no desire to take it further-though i could have-so i just relaxed in his arms...i could feel him smell my hair and lean his face next to mine...but right at that moment, a cop car pulled up next to his car (where we'd parked it about 1/2 mile away).  It seemed like a good time to go home.  We talked on the way home and he said that he almost kissed me right when the cop car pulled up, and that its been hard for him to resist fooling around with me these past few days.  I reminded him that he was the one who was always talking about how great it is that we dont fool around, and that instead we are just good friends.  He said, ""Yeah, but youre leaving in a few days so it woulnt be complicated"".  I told him that i didnt want to complicate the good thing we have going, and that besides, i didnt want to fool around with anyone anymore- i told him: ""I want to be loved- i dont want to just be youre fuck-buddy"".  He said that he respected that, and wished he were at that point.  
Last night, i said goodbye to him.  It was hard because he was so sad.  So i gave him a big hug and a kiss on the cheek, and thanked him for everything.  He gave me a card, which was so sweet- nice that i'll have that to remember him by.  And so we said goodbye.  .....Still waiting to leave though...45 hours and counting...."

"event","So, I'm in Dixon...waiting for time to pass-- Dang, when did the clock slow down?? There is NOTHING to do here. I find myself waiting for work, just to have something to do- but when work comes, i look for any excuse to leave.  Granted its only a week and a half, but man!  
Been hanging out with Hans alot- almost every night.  He calls...saves me from the hell that is boredom...we'll go out and have fun and he'll end the night with a suprisingly sweet text message.  For example, last nights message: ""Goodnight Sweet Pea, have fun in san fran"".  Suprizing, because now more than ever, we have a clear definition of our friendship--that is: Just friends.  Really i am not even attracted to him.  But, as i have always said about him, i enjoy his company. And when youre bored in a sleepy town called dixon and a friend calls you up, you dont act picky, you just do it.  
But he's busy to night and so here i am wasting more time, this time on the internet.  Incidently, all of Dixon, including my parents go to sleep at 9:30pm.  So here i am.
On friday night, i was with Hans and he was asking where all my dorm friends went and i told him they were all at their homes (for example: James in PA, Danielle in Napa, and many others are in so cal).  We were just driving along until i realized that we were in Napa!  I couldnt beleive it- we hadnt talked about doing it- he just suprised me with it.  So we hung out with Danielle for a few hours with her sis Gloria.  I learned how to play spoons, which was cool.  I know that likely Hans took me there mostly from selfish desire (she is beautiful and he is horny).  But i wonder if he had other intentions.  I told him at the end of the night: ""what you did tonight- taking me there- meant alot to me"".  Doing that for me, just to make me happy, made me respect him.  
Today, Mom and i went to san fransico, which was fun.  We focused mostly on the wharf and pier 39 (last time, we spent most of the day in chinatown).  Saw lots of beach, water, and tourist items...which was cool.  Had some amazing clam chowder at a restauraunt right on the wharf.  I got to eat crab legs (-never done that before)--very messy, but fun.  I bought a SF mug for Nick, because he gave me a mug from Bella, shortly before i left CB. 
Five more days of work....eight more full days in california...I guess i'll be there sooner than i thought...."

Had a tough time at first, but i know now that we all did.  Learned so much- both inside and outside the classroom.  Grew up a lot, i feel.  I dont feel like a kid so much, and though i dont feel ""adult"" i feel comfortable with this middle stage.  
I am so glad i started this journal, its allowed me to chronicle so many of the escapades of this great year.  So many memories- feel haunted by them now...sitting in a room that is no longer the one i know and love...hugging friends goodbye, not sure when i'll see them again.  I feel strange.  Not sad to leave.  So strange.  I feel exited, earlier i had butterflies.  Because i love that i'm leaving, though it is hard.  Dont know when i'll be back, hope to visit soon enough though.  I've met good people...the type i could see myself friends with for a very, very long time.  Many people meet their best friends in college and stay close to for the rest of their life, and i feel i've found that here.  To my girls-Danielle, Jaqui, Heather, Lindsey, Lauren- friends like noneother than i've ever had before: Thank you for loving me like you do, for accepting me unconditionally, for teaching me what friends truly are- I love you all.  
Well before i break down in sentamental nonsense, i will go.  Hope to update soon, but dont know when.  Goodbye G4, it was great!"

Then Jaq and i wrote eachother a note, and i wanted to cry, i was so touched...but Jaq cried for me, and we hugged.  And i thought, man, i'm going to miss her so much.
Today, I had dinner with Heathers family, who are soooo nice.  Really i love them, i swear i have 2 new sisters now!  It was fun, and then i said goodbye to heather, which was hard.  We hugged for about 5 mins, and i thought man, i'm gonna miss her so much.

Feel relieved to see her, just once, before i leave.  Fell overwhelmed because it's been so long.  Feel strange because it reminded me of unhappy days.  Feel insecure because i wish i'd looked better today.  Not that it matters...but just as visual evidence to my statement: ""Yea, I'm doing really well"".  Thinking that shes thinking, ""She's still the same""- knowing that i feel shes the same, basically.  She said she was happy- I asked her directly.  And thats good becasue thats all that matters.  maybe it bothered me because in one converstation i couldnt adequatly portray all that had happened in a year.  I couldnt really show her who i'd grown to be.  I wanted to tell her about the events and the changes- all the moments, friends, smiles and tears.  But i couldnt.  Thats why i likely appeared ""the same"".  
She said that mallory is talking and says funny things like ""Oh my God"".  And that made me laugh- but it was strange because i couldnt picture it- since the Mallory i'd known was a baby.  
But I'd spoken with confidence and assertiveness and i hope she'd noticed the change.  Not to prove that, ""I'm better off without her"", but to prove that she doesnt know me anymore.  That i wasnt the same person who was dorky, ugly, and out of place- that i wasnt the person who needed her.  And i wish she could know that.
In spite of it all, shes still the same person.  She still stood stiff and distant when i hugged her.  She still wore too much makeup.  She still dressed in those same clothes.  But she said she was happy..and i guess thats all that matters.  So I'll relax and accept her...as i wish she'd done me so long ago...."

"event","Wow, camping...what to say?  So many inside jokes.  Haha.  
So we started the day yesterday in a bit of chaos.  We were sopposed to leave at 12pm, but as a result of bad communication and happen-stance, we ended up leaving the dorm at 1:30pm.  Of course, though, there was a pit stop at Albertsons, so really we didnt leave until 2.  Thats when the fun began, since really, none of us knew how to get there, and our great idea about communicating with cell phones didnt work, since no one could get a signal.  So the ""caravan"" was stopped so many times...akwardly fitting 5 cars on the side of the road...people running back to other cars...ice everywhere (sorry moses)...In the end it took us 2 hours to get there, when its normally a 45 minute trip.  So many detours and bad senses of direction (under breath) Danielle....
But finally we were there, at a nice size camp site right on the Lake.  We had stairs down to our strip of shore (about 1/4 mile long).  Everyone was pretty cranky from the trip, but once we got in the lake and got a few beers in everyone, we were feeling good.  Everyone was having a great time.  We had so much food...and believe me, there was SO MUCH beer- it was insane!  We stayed up all night telling jokes (Greg: ""Alright so a scot, and irishman, and an englishman are in a bar, and..."") and stories (James: ""It was a night very much like tonight....only not at all like tonight"".....[20 minutes later]....""and thats the end of the story""  <<-- such a long story!).  We spent the night talking about the Zodiac killer---- who incidently lives at Lake Berryessa, so naturally, we were a little freaked.  But really, our fears were relieved when Greg assured us that HE was the zodiac killer, providing a killer-voice to boot.  I only got 4 hours of sleep, but i feel good right now.  We swam in the lake again this morning before we left.  It was nice.  And best of all, no one thought about school or finals for one, very nice day."

Wondering how long i'd have to wait until we could be close again.

Dont know why its so strange...maybe because the girls are gone, so the dorm feels like a ghost town...maybe because Stuart packed up his room today, and the bare walls struck me with the reality of how soon the end is...but somehow i feel ok...
    The sun is setting and that depresses me...dont know why.  I never liked the darkness...the sunshine makes me happy.  I remember in fall quarter when i would feel so depressed first thing in the morning, but i'd step outside to go to an early class, and suddenly i was breathing easier.  Too many weird things happen after sunset...too many lonely moments...some good times to be sure, but still i think i perfer day.

I was there for 3 days and i couldnt recall having lived anywhere else...each face so familar and kindred.  Perhaps my cold feet stemmed from memories of the end of the summer, when things became weird....like they are now..here.  Its the natural progression of things.  Granted, i am exited about the camping trip- It will be great.  But still, its all coming to an end, and i can feel that now.  And so, it feels better to be leaving.  What a great summer it will be...short, but freakin awesome, i know it.

And things keep coming up that keep me from it.  Living life is so much better than studying, so when oppurtunites arise, I loose focus...and then the hours slip through my fingers.  And here I am, beating myself up about how much work i have to do.  I told myself during winter quarter that my grades wouldnt really matter this quarter, since its the end.  But, in spite of it all, i still care.  I wonder what it would be like to not work, but honestly, i dont think i would like it....though it would be nice to have spare time to kick back and get bored.  Some complain that they are ""so bored"" and feel the need to ""waste time""...and some self-righteous part of me wants to hand them my life for 5 minutes- just to show them what hard work is.  But then i realize...if i didnt work, i'd be just like them...taking hours for granted, ect...and I wouldnt feel bad at all, i really wouldnt know the difference.  And neither do they--so i guess its ok."

"event","I just went to CEF at the Chinese Church...I cant even explain how much i like it there.  Its the craziest thing because everyone is short and asian, but i am so comfortable.  Yeah, so life is good, really good.  I'm so happy.
  I stayed up till 2am with heather last night, making ""sexy music""...haha (We're not lesbians- I swear!)  She made me a cd..and that made me happy.  I'm so glad that things are good with us.  And before that, I was with Jaq and Lindsey making a collage for D, who was studying her tush off.  We made her smile (because the collage was filled with sexy, and naked, men)...good times. 
  Work's been good, some crazy things have happened with people getting in accidents, but its cool.  Patty is still being great to me...she was in a bad mood today (she's tired) and I dont like it when she's moody, but oh well.  Sometimes I wonder if Whitney (my replacement) will completly overshadow me.  The other day at work, Patty said: ""We're going to miss you so much...I just cant even perceive that you are leaving""  and i said, ""Eh, it will be fine..Whitney will come, I will leave and you'll never think of me again"".  And though part of it was a joke, and part of it was fishing...part of it was just honesty.  I like feeling special and valued...but Whitney, I'm afraid, will make me look like Joe-mediocre...and, well, I dont know...
  I have to stop thinking about how soon i'm leaving...i dont want to waste my last weeks here.  But, honestly I feel like i'm freaking out.  Last week i realized that I was leaving in 6 weeks, and now its down to 5, and I feel like its slipping through my fingers.  Nick said, ""6 weeks is a long time""..but to me it feels so short.  In 25 days I will have to leave the dorm...leave all my college friends...say goodbye for who knows how long...leave this year that has been so much fun..that i've loved so much.  And, though I'll be going to summer staff which makes me exited, I'm torn.  Why must I continually be battling within myself--- grr...Someday I'll figure out what i really want.  Someday."

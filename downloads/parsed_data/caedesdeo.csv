This is my result from something called the Bem sex role inventory, filled out as honestly as I could. Yes, it's now 40 years old. Yes, societal views on sex and gender have changed since it was created. No, this is not the equivalent to any sort of trained/professional analysis. It's still something of a relief.

It's the family pc. It was made by a bloke the milkman knew. It's old, and it's senile, and it's being kept going by the pc equivalent of duct tape and hope. 

For the life of me, I do not know why. We have a new pc, still in it's box, waiting for the files from this one to be transferred to it and for this one to be taken down so it can replace it.

Dad was waiting for mum to finish some work on it from wednesday, before attempting the transfer yesterday. He didn't do it. Mum had actually finished said work. <b>On wednesday.</b> Neither of them had actually spoken to the other about this.

I just want to set fire to the thrice-bedamned thing and have done with it.

However, one of the (inevitable) profile things is a picture. And I hate most of the pictures of me in existance, so this caused me to glower at the screen for a while before simply ignoring the issue.

It did get me thinking though. I'm likely to end up using my most recent Fbook profile pic, which I have (probably) uploaded under the cut. If you bother looking at it, can you answer the question at the bottom?

Merlin, 412 words, M/A, G-rated. First posted <a href=""http://thisissirius.livejournal.com/482675.html?thread=7224179"">here</a>, for <lj user=""thisissirius"">'s Magical Reveal meme-thing.

<lj-cut text=""Pause/Rewind"">

Arthur is attacked, and Merlin is almost too late. Arthur lives, and Merlin's magic remains hidden. They fall into each other's arms, find love there, are careless with themselves.

Uther will not abide a union with no heirs. Merlin is executed, and something in Arthur dies with him.

Camelot falls.

~

The attack comes and Merlin is nearly too late. Arthur lives, and his magic is still secret. 
He becomes too inured to the burden of secrecy. When his Prince is finally King, he tries to tell him, fails.
Eventually, Arthur finds out and the betrayal is only compounded with time. He exiles Merlin, never to return while he rules.

Camelot falls.

~

The attack comes, and Merlin is nearly too late. Arthur is saved, but he saw magic performed before his very eyes, and his broken trust guides his sword.

Merlin dies, and Camelot falls.

~

The attack comes, and Merlin is nearly too late. Arthur lives, and is furious. His anger burns out quickly, and he agrees to keep Merlin's secret.

Uther finds out. Arthur is imprisoned while Merlin burns.

Camelot falls.

~

The attack comes, and Merlin is in time. Arthur lives, finally pieces together a dozen and more instances of luck and timing and chance to reveal Merlin's secret.

He keeps Merlin's secret from his father, but cannot get to Morgana in time to keep hers as well.

She is outcast, turns to the Druids for sanctuary and revenge, and Camelot falls.

~

Another attack, and Merlin is in time. Arthur pulls the whole truth from him, and confronts Morgana about her visions. Gwen stands up for her mistress, and Arthur binds himself to her secret as well. The burden is spread between them, lightened, easier to bear, more open between them.

Uther suspects, and orders the servants tortured. Merlin and Morgana break with Gwen, and flee into exile. Arthur follows, disinherited.

Camelot falls.

~

Morgana warns him in time, and Merlin runs with her to save Arthur. Their secrets are open to him now, and he rages into acceptance.

The four of them keep their counsel as the king ages, as Arthur eases himself into the space left by a dying king.

Arthur's first official act following his ascension to the throne is to repeal Uther's draconian laws against magic, Merlin flanking him instead of a queen as they face the court. Behind them, Gwen flanks Morgana in a perfect mirror of power and devotion. 

Camelot rises."

Ditto tv programs. Yes, I want to watch the 3 shows I have in the planner. Yes, I know one of them partially clashes with your precious repeats of Gordon fucking Ramsey. Yes, for the second time, I do want to watch that particular show. No, I can't catch the repeat as that clashes entirely with something else.

Supernatural, possibly Sam/Dean. Just one scene from it sticks out, of Sam (I think) getting them plain gold band rings from an antiques shop, old enough that the engraving had worn smooth, and there was a line about Dean now having a band of gold on his left to match silver on his right.

I think it's Spn, I know it's not Trek and not Merlin and I've not been reading much other fandom stuff lately.

This is good.

What is <i>not</i> good, is the way my fingers have gone down at least one ring size.
I wear two thumb rings, one of which is now falling-off too big. 

It's stainless steel. Which apparently you can't get resized.

This is somehow more upsetting than I'd've thought."

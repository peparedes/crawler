"event","As my ""just for fun"" book of choice this fall I've decided to take a leaf out of former President George W. Bush's Book. I'm going to read the Bible before anything else this (school) year (besides my GMAT study guides). I've never read it from cover to cover before, only in sections during a service.

Where I am right now: 
Moses and Aaron are leading the hebrews to the Red Sea. 

What I never noticed before:
Moses was slow of speech. This makes me want to watch the movie The Ten Commandments and see how Charlton Heston portrays Moses. Maybe after all my applications are in (around the first week in January) I'll rent it and see how it is. Has anyone seen it? Is it any good?"

Because it is run by students the music on it is different every few hours. I rarely listened to it till I was bored on the way to work and discovered that every tuesday in the morning is ALL Elvis music and every wednesday in the morning is hawaiian music (it's called WIKI WIKI Wednesday!). Makes me smile on the two middle days of the week. Thursdays don't count.
Thats all. Hope all of your lives are awesome. :D

"event","Yesterday Sammy and I went to the beach at sunset. We played a little catch and this man came by walking his dog. He mentioned he hadn't played catch in a while. It didn't occur to me till he had passed Sammy that perhaps he had wanted to play a bit. I over threw the ball. It hit the rocks near him. He looked at it in a sweet little boy hopeful kind of way.  He picked the ball up and sammy put up his glove...he made to throw at me and did.  I threw the ball back and forth with him a bit with sammy's glove and then he threw a bit with sammy. I think it helped him. He seemed so happy when he left.
Then a woman came with her dog and her sweater in her arms.  There was a duck inside her sweater that had been injured.  She asked if we could hold it and take care of her dog because she had seen 2 other hurt ducks she wanted to help.  I held the duck and sammy played with the dog. The duck moved. It kicked and jumped out of my arms but was obviously injured. I picked it up again to keep it warm.  She took so long we thought it might have been a reality show but she came back grabbed the duck and left, with her dog trailing behind. 
What a weird day...

Also, my camera is broken. I dropped it down two stories when we were on a field trip at the tech museum."

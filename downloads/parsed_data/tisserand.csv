I am currently doing Corporations Law.

I have been studying non stop for a week now, and I spent the day today going through past exams papers.

It took me and another person (who is a very good student) nearly 3 hours to go through the 2005 exam paper. This included just discussing the issues, without writing anything down.

My question to you is how exactly, if at all, are we expected to write an answer to this question in 2 hours and 10 minutes (minus reading time), if it takes 2 people 3 hours to work out the issues?

I look forward to your prompt reply, hopefully before the exam tomorrow morning.

The email started well enough, all about the ""it was fun while it lasted"", ""i hope we can be friends!"" and all that shit. And then the more I wrote, the more stuff started coming out and I realised that I had convinced myself that this was a casual fling thing, whatever. 

But, it turns out it really wasn't. Why can we never lie to ourselves for long? (or just for long ENOUGH)

By the end of the email, I was sort of panicky and then I sent it off before I got too freaked out and deleted it all.

I don't really ""fall"" (or even stumble) for people very easily and definitely not at all often. Sure, I'm attracted to a fair amount of people (i DO have SOME standards), but it usually fizzles remarkably quickly. And yes, that it had to happen just before my return to Perth is annoying.

I returns to Perth on <b>January 3rd</b>, which is like a week later than originally planned, and means I will miss Breakfest but also means a flight that is NOT 5 days long, but 16 hours, which is good.

I'm enrolled in 2006, doing the following units:

Corporations Law
Admin 1
Conflict of Laws
International Trade Law
Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Law

2nd semester (which I most likely won't be doing in 2006, but 2007))
Con Law 2
Evidence
Admin 2
Mining and Energy Law
Banking Law

<b>A VERY CUNNING PLAN</b> by Milos

<i>Stage 1)</i>

Approved Leave for semester 2 2006

<i>Stage 2)</i>

Schedule Procedure, Conveyancing and Drafting and the 2 Honours Units for 2008

The above leaving you with:

2007 being a part-time year

<i>Stage 3)</i>

Take some time off to relax and recharge, possibly by performing an elaborate interpretive dance in honour of the Goddess.

<i>Stage 4)</i>

By cleverly manipulating the space-time continuum, all of the units you need and want to do in 2007 are in 2nd semester.

<B>THUS</B>

You have no units in 1st semester 2007,

Combined with <i>Stage 1</i> above

<b>RESULTS IN</b>

Having no work whatsoever from June 2006 until August 2007.

 <b>MILOS: 1; THE SYSTEM: ZERO</b>.

Of course, this is all geared for me doing Law honours. If I decide to do ARTS honours instead.... well... that's a whole different story then. One that is far more complicated and involves extensive use of Time-Turners.

Or else leaving uni some time in my mid-40s.

Not too fussed though. I don't actually want to do anything apart from work for the UN, and all I need to for that is to get my Masters in SOMETHING by the time I'm 32."

decisions for next year:

1) acting lessons 
- i've always stayed away from things i suck at, even if i enjoyed doing them... i used to like acting when i was like 10, you know that age when you don't need to be good, just cute and grownups go ""AWWW, YOU'RE SO GOOD!"" but what they really mean is ""AWW, YOU'RE SO CUTE IN YOUR LITTLE BEE COSTUME!"". But cute just don't cut it anymore! So i've not been acting [bar the Smerfs appearance and the now-let-us-never-speak-of-it-again Indian Ink]. so i figure i want to do something I like again.

2) gym
- i need the energy and the endorphins and, yes, the strength to punch through brick walls. who doesn't in this day and age?

3) no drugs

4) some vague notion about burning down the Law School building


I think this will do for now."

"event","So, succeeded in making a complete fool of myself last night.

We went to a friend's birthday party and I knew that Stephen's ex boyfriend of 3 years, whom I'd never met, was going to be there. NOW, I have NO problem with exes.

Unless of course those exes happen to be tall, buff, really goodlooking, confident and extremely sociable and friendly hi-power corporate lawyers who used to play rugby for Oxford.

He went out of his way to be really friendly and he seems like a GENUINELY nice guy, which of course only made me feel more threatened, which I HATED cos I fucking NEVER feel threatened in these situations!

So what do I do?

I hit the tequila. And the vodka. And the gin. And it all goes south from there. I blacked out around 1.30am, when Stephen had to take me home.

I hate this. I hate that Stephen totally realised why I was so insecure.

BUT... I felt better (if no less MORTIFIED) by the end of the night.

Stephen took me home, took care of me, put me to bed, made me drink lots of water and while I was belting ""Waltzing Matilda"", made me eggs on toast at 2.30am, so the grease would suck up the alcohol, all the while being really understanding. And this morning, we had a bit of a laugh about it all...

I guess he must like me, cos nothing says true love like carrying your drunken lover home and making him eggs at 2.30am..."

"event","In London, finally, for just over a week now.

It's been really really really good! I've thrown caution to the wind and dived into a relationship, and it actually makes me happy. I'm not freaking out or anything, which... yeah, definitely a step up! Known him for about 2 months now and it just feels ... easy and unforced... and fun.

I've been exploring this beautiful city, hanging out with amazing people... Even a little taste of Perth today - just had coffee/lunch with Cat! We browsed the whole of Camden Markets for goodies, but were disappointed for the most of it. ""Camden stopped being cutting-edge several thousand cheap leather jackets ago.""

I'm 100% glad that I ended up coming to London because I'm now 100% sure that I don't want to stay. It's strange, having wanted this so much at one point to now realise that I don't really want to be here. In fact, the only reason I ended up coming was Stephen. And as amazing as that relationship is, and as much as I would want that to be enough, it just isn't. I'm just not the kind of person who can be happy with any sort of situation, as long as they're with someone they ... love... or care for, or whatever. Stephen has been amazing and understanding and caring, and I've never felt this way about anyone before. But in the end... I'm not ready to put my life on hold just so I could be with him. Am I simply not built for relationships, being too selfish and self-absorbed? Maybe. Definitely maybe. But I can't go against what I know I want. Not for him, not for anyone.

<b>Travel Plans</b>

So, on the 19th, I'm going off to Paris for some time with Nay (PISS OFF YA GROTTY LITTLE WANKER!!!!), then to Copenhagen with Stephen, Jimmy and Michelle and then to Germany. And then to Spain with my sister (actually really looking forward to travelling with her) and then 

then

then

the ULTIMATE

the UNBEATABLE

going to Brussels to once again bask in the presence of one of the funnest human beings around - La Belge. I have missed her so much, having last seen her in New York (where she made a point of congradulating some random New Yorker on how impressive she found the Empire State Building to be...). We are going to the Backstreet Boys reunion concert. It will be the ultimate post-Canada experience... Some of the funnest times this year included La Belge, Suza, The German, Nic, Micheal and me in the confined space of a minivan/karaoke room at The Marble Arch, belting out the BB classics, and spicing them up with some Avril and N'Stink. *wipes tear*

I have a plan:

Me and Hanna (La Belge's actual name...), front row for the Backstreet Boys, screaming ""DO <b>NOBODY'S HOME</B>!!! DO <b>NOBODY'S HOME</b>!!!!"" at the band, who will be standing there confused, wondering if they actually have a song called <B>NOBODY'S HOME</b>, as the two of us are being dragged away by the riot police, kicking and screaming. Goooooood times.

<b>Summary</b>

Looking back on the whole Vancouver experience. Fuck that was awesome. Some of the most amazing, kind, beautiful people I've ever met. And a decent number of them are in Perth now, which makes me a very happy camper.

Looking back at my time spent in Serbia... a drug-induced haze, but I guess that's what summer is for, right? 

London... yeah, definitely glad I came here, definitely glad i'm exploring this amazing place and definitely sure there's not enough for me here right now.

The next 4 months... *big wide grin*"

"event","Summer days... 2 weeks ago, summer finally arrived, weather-wise. Again. And it's been amazing... warm, balmy, hot, boiling, then sleepless nights from the heat. Moist skin, thick air, opaque eventualities.

I got my UK visa on Monday (2 year Working Holidaymaker one) and now all that's left to do is buy a ticket, pack and leave.

... and I'm not sure what I want to do. Had you asked me a month ago, I definitely fucking did. In many ways, EXIT was a peak and a low. About a week after it, having overcome a bout of you-know-which post-partying feelings, everything started changing for the better. I really like it here now. I'm actually having fun with cool people.

And I really wanted to go to London. And I really don't know now. It seems, of course, like something I've been wanting for a while. And it seems like I'm letting myself down if I don't do it.

I'm torn between:

a) I want to go to London but it's easier to stay here where everything's familiar and not bother

OR

b) I want to go to London but I want to stay here more, because I am actually having fun here for the first time ever and am not (also for the first time ever) looking forward to leaving

I don't know which one it is.

I don't want to stay here just because it's easier and I don't want to go to London just because it's something I wanted before and something I SHOULD want.

However, having said all this, I'm not a ball of anxiety... I know I'll make the right decision... maybe a compromise (go to London but come back and spend more time here). Either way, I will do what i WANT to do, not what I think i SHOULD do. It's just that right now I'm not sure what I WANT to do, which is so ANNOYING because for once, I decide to go with my instincts and that's exactly the moment they stop being... instincty."

That was last week pillaged and burnt down by the invading barbarians.

After a week of INTENSE hedonism, I had a total emotional/physical breakdown on Tuesday, after seeing Luke off. I got home, backed my little bag and ran out of town, to my auntie's house, where I've done nothing but sleep and eat for 3 days now. No plan to do much else soon.

EXIT was brilliant, though it brought to the surfice an issue I've been refusing to deal with for a while (well, ever since it became an issue). But, no more. When the body went ""OH MY GOD, I'M IMPLODING!!!!"", it was time to stop. A week later it still has me exhausted and with sporadic nasty headaches and depression. Done and done with it.

The ABSOLUTE highpoint of EXIT:

Day 2, midnight. Garbage is meant to come on in half an hour. A MOTHERFUCKER of a storm comes out of nowhere, it's raining turds, the giant main stage gets completely soaked and almost blown away. People start leaving, I start panicking. An hour and a half later, we're still standing there, FROZEN from the COLD and the WET, when they finally grace us with an announcement: ""The band is willing to perform, but the entire stage, and all their equipement, is wet. We'll see what we can do."" Half an hour later, they come on and play one of the best sets I've ever heard. Flawless playing and singing (SHIRLEY MANSON!!!), so much eneregy! These guys aren't just musicians, they're performers as well and they really knew how to engage the audience and have a blast.

The moment of moments:

Shirley: ""This one's for you crazy motherfuckers who stood out here waiting for us for two motherfucking hours.

<i>I'm singing in the rain
Just singing in the rain
I don't know the fucking lyrics

And then he whips out his business card (no, that's not a penis metaphore), don't ask me why, and it looked EXACTLY like the cards that Christian Bale, Jared Leto and the other wankers compare in American Psycho. The colour, the simple blank font, the no-graphics, it WAS on of the American Psycho cards!!!

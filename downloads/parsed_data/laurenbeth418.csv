She is doing great with her walking. She is really moving! She can walk from one side of the room to the other and almost all the way back. She totally understands something being inside something else. For example, a toy being inside a box. She knows how to open and close things, and take things out and put them back in. She amazes me more each day. 

She really seems to be doing good at daycare too. All of the teachers love her and she seems to get along well with the other kids. I always get good reports at the end of her days there which is also wonderful.

Her transition to milk is also going better then expected. When shes really tired or upset though she still wants the formula. Shes also getting better with a sippy cup. She uses it a lot at daycare but she knows I'll give in and give her a bottle.

Since I didnt have to work until 1:00 and my Mom picked her up at like 4:30, it was only a half day which was good because then she could ease into it better. She didnt cry AT ALL when I left - I dont think she even noticed. However, when we got there they were putting all the kids down for naps and of course, Kaylin goes and wakes ALL of them up. Way to make a first impression! AND she already has a little boyfriend. His name is Jack and they were laughing and playing together all day and wouldnt play with anyone else. I knew I'd have to beat off the boys but I didnt think I'd have to start this young! Tomorrow is her first full day so hopefully all goes well.

I love my new friend. He brings me joy time and time again. (And no ladies, I'm not talking about a dildo)

My cousin sent a ton of her daughters clothes that dont fit (too bad Kaylin cant wear them until shes like 2) and a HUGE box of scrap booking stuff which I'm so freakin excited for. They are also sending me 7 other presents throughout the year because they believe the XMAS sprit should last all year. I'm really excited!

I cant wait until next year when she can go. I tried to get them to let me go on with her and have her sit on my lap but they said I was too big. I'LL SHOW YOU TOO BIG!

Lesson - NEVER believe anything that anyone tells you about someone else even if they are your friend.
You lied to me and almost recked my family over it. Fuck you.

Joe and I are working things out. We are sick of fighting. Things have been going good so far. Hopefully they continue on the same path.

Went to Stacey's Dad's and brother's yesterday. It was so good to see them, its been like 4 years. Jesse's daughter is so cute - her name is Riley. It was just a little weird because thats my old dogs name. Kaylin loved playing with her though, however she was a lot more interested in the cats. It was a fun day.

Been hanging out with Stacey a lot which is sweet. Her and Zach love playing with Kaylin which makes me happy.

Things with Joe and I....

We are going to pick up our couch sometime this week if it ever stops raining! I have to also find a job working midnights this week so Joe can start his new job. I'll miss REI - but I gotta go where the money is. Stacey used to work midnights at a CVS so maybe I'll look into something like that. I really DO NOT want to go back to waitressing and since there are so many people attending bartending school, places don't train you on how to do that anymore. But we'll see - I might end up with some stupid factory job but I hope not.

I don't know if I'm the only one but I can't believe its almost September! Time is just flying by."

And if I did - I probably wouldn't have the best thing in my life, my amazing daughter. I feel like my experiences have made me a better person, but I wish I could have acquired the knowledge without actually living through some of it.

"event","Kaylin had ber 6 month check up/shots today. She did awesome. She didn't even cry during the shots which was great. Shes 14lbs 3oz and about 25in long. Her doctor said shes right on track with everything and she looks fantastic. Shes really enjoying fruits, shes not so hot in veggies though but all in good time. She is going to be crawling any day now. Its so crazy to think that shes already almost 6 months old. Your parents always say ""Oh I can't believe your this old already"" but once your a parent its SO true!

Staying at my Mom is HELL. I hate living with people. Yeah she helps with Kaylin sometimes but MY GOD! Just leave me the fuck alone sometimes. I dont want to answer 50 million questions every time I walk in the door. And I'm going to punch Harvey right in the fucking face - its a ticking time bomb.

I'm glad Stacey and I are hanging out more. I miss all the time we used to spend together. I took Kaylin over there the other day and she had a blast. Its funny hanging out with Nicole because I've known her since she was like 10 and now shes like...a real person. But shes cool.

I love my hunnie."

Joe just got a new job at a car shop. Today was his first day and he said he likes it so far. At least he found something that he likes instead of some bullshit job.

P.S. I changed my journal and I love it."

Went to River Days yesterday with my Mom, Harvey and Kaylin. It was a blast! However, my shoulders and back are so burned. Ouch. Then we went to see my Gpa. Hes doing good, I just wish he'd kick that stupid woman out of his house!

Tomorrow my Mom, Kaylin and I are going to my Aunt Kathy's in the morning and then hopefully shopping.

Things with Joe and I have improved SO much. We aren't fighting nearly as much anymore. I think when you really love someone, especially if you have a child together, you should try your hardest to make it work and stick it out until the very end. Hopefully things continue on this path."

Right now we're trying to work through it. He knows hes on thin ice though. Its so hard when you have a child together because you want everything to work out for them. Things are going ok so far. I still cant believe it even happened and got to the extent it did so quickly.

Kaylin, Jessica, Agusta and I are going to the zoo this week. Woot woot! Its gonna be so much fun. Hopefully its not too hot when we go though or Kaylin will not be happy.

Kaylin eats cereal once a day now. Sometimes more ends up on her then in her but thats ok. Her doc said to feed it to her at dinner time but she definitely likes it for breakfast better. Even though she is 12.1 pounds now she still fits into newborn (which is supposed to be like 5 - 8.5 pounds) and doesnt fir into anything that says her weight. Its good I guess because her clothes will last longer but I want her to wear all of her cute little outfits!

My Mom is totally loving being a Gma. She carries around a whole photo book of her and shows it to EVERYONE. Its kind of embarrassing sometimes, but its cute.

This Friday she goes to my Mom's for a sleepover and you know what thats means ladies and gentlemen...PAAARTAAAY!"

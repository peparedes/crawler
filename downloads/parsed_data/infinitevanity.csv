"event","Today I met the most adorable boy ever. I seriously want to adopt him. NOW. It's like the cutest thing you could ever picture and I was all, oh my god, I want him. His mother didn't want to give him away though. Really, really sad about that. She said I could have him for a day or something but not forever, now I'm sad. Because it's the boy of my dreams. Never seen such an adorable kid before. I mean, ok, he's got an adorable mother, but that doesn't mean anything does it? And such a shy, cute, little thing. He screams cuddle me with every movement. I wish, one could buy them like that and wouldn't have to educate them to become that way. That's too much work. I want a finished version.

Bad news, a good friend has cancer, like stomach and intestines and it looks shit and he's not even 30 yet. I mean, wtf? Why? So, that's the bad news.

I'm kind of sick and tired. Hopefully getting that iron soon. And I work too much. But that's a well known fact. I finally got to wash clothes too. I haven't in like 4 weeks. Because usually I work. But tonight I was at S.'s and then came home. Where I could wash. So, happy camper for that. Uni is ok. Not really anything new. But interesting and I won't be going as usual.

SAKE starts soon. Swiss labour force survey. 13 shifts next week. Monday and Wendesday the whole day there. That's gonna be tough. Oh well, it'll be ok, I will survive. Otherwise, everything alright. Except, I want that boy!"

So, the newspaper we want to do for the Psychology students, somehow I ended up being on top of it, somehow I ended up being the one responsible for everything. Somehow I ended up with a job that will cost me lots and lots of work. And I don't even know how. But I don't mind, I like that position and I'm looking forward to the challenge. But still, how did that happen? Why is my position suddenly head of the bloody thing? How? Why? And I didn't even try to go for it. It just fell into my lap. And I ended up working something completely different to what I wanted anyways, how? I don't know how. But here I am.

I should be searching for literature for my semester work. I have to do that this weekend. Find all articles. I already got the books. Then read them next week and then start putting up the concept, I have two weeks to read the shit and come up with a concept. And then I have two weeks to write a chapter. I will need gf as inspiration. Oh, the title of the work btw, is: The dream as a mean of communication! Should prove to be interesting, but still, work.

Other things that gotta be done:
<ul>
<li> Clean appartment.</li>
<li> Wash clothes.  </li>
<li> Send contract for work back, very important, gotta be done!  </li>
<li> Sort bank and uni and other stuff.  </li>
<li> Gather literature, write down concept.  </li>
</ul>

The exams in february are not as important, they'll be fine and I will pass them without problem. Just that bloody paper gotta be done and it's not that much time. And then the bloody newspaper for the Psychology Students as if I didn't have enough work. And of course my job, what about my job, when will I have time for my job? I gotta work at least twice a week.
But probably it just looks like a lot right now but I can actually be done with most of it in like a day.

Oh and that's what I'll have to do with Nanowrimo if I don't want to fail it!"

I hate the inability to relax and lay back and fall asleep when I'm so fucking tired I just want to cry because I'm so desperate for sleep. And for every night that I manage to sleep I get two nights that keep me up.
Work is too much stress at the moment. I have two shifts nearly every day and that makes it nothing more than a 100% job, but damnit, aren't I a 100% student?
I want to bloody sleep.
I want to realx.
And I want to stop hating the world. Even though that one didn't deserve any better.
I used to find it cool, when I was 13, people used to say, I'm so stressed I couldn't sleep. Or, I love him so much, it kept me up all night, I couldn't even close my eyes. Or, it just keeps me awake. I cannot sleep at all.
And I always thought, what the hell is their problem? No matter how bad I was doing, I could sleep! No matter how shitty life was, when I was in bed I could sleep and sleep would make it better and it was something I would do to make time pass. Nothing could ever keep me awake. I just slept.
Oh, how I wish those times back!"

"event","1) The doctor made the tests and found nothing. Let's ignore that the nice lady from last time actually told the guys in radiology that it was my right breast that had the lump and not my left one. It doesn't matter, he didn't find a thing. He tried and he felt that the whole thing was kind of swollen and that it hurt but he couldn't find a darn thing. It all looked healthy to him. So, now I'm left with a breast that hurts and a doctor that tells me it ain't anything. But still in pain, nah? So, I'm not quite sure what will happen next. But I guess my GP will tell me as soon as I see him on Wednesday morning. Maybe then we will bring some light into this mistery and find out what exactly I got.

2) Work. I'm now doing group discussions. It gives you less money per hour but with every guy that actually follows your call and shows up for the discussion you get an additional 18 bucks. Which means that with finding two people per night already gives you a good 75 bucks which is already more than I make at the moment. But you never know, it could go wrong. Who knows. But I want to try because most guys tell me that their worst group discussion was still more money per hour than just sitting on the phone. I hope I'm not making a mistake. Today we had bad addresses and it was going towards a complete disaster. Which I don't like seeing as I'm really needing the money. Hope tomorrow will turn out well.

3) As I sat at the tramstation waiting for the tram this guy passed me by. And guess what, he was from my old school. I hadn't seen him in like 8 years. He went to school with me from when I was 12 until I was 15. He was one of my first crushes. He was always so hot. But he was a boy. Now he's got a beard, mature facial strucctures, deep voice, is grown and stufs. It was so weird. It was like what happened to the cute boy, why's there a man? And he changed so much. Anyways he recognized me immediately and talked to me for ages about what had happened to the other classmates and what everyone was doing. I loved it. It made me feel awesome.

So, hopefully tonight I can sleep!"

I have nowhere to go, no one understands me, no one takes care of me and everyone comes running to me with their problems and I'm sick of it. And when I ask for some understanding, for some time or for some patience I either get bitched at or ignored or simply don't get it. Or I get a fake reply that I can later on find out didn't mean anything at all. And I'd rather get nothing than people pretending to care or pretending to understand.

"event","Ok, this morning at 8, I moved my ass to the hospital and sat down waiting for a German doctor who seemed younger than me and even more clueless. She listened to me and seemed to be mildly amused by the things that had happened to me which I didn't exactly like. There was no need to have eyebrows raised while listening. So she pokes around my arm, hurting it and then declares that she thinks it's not a lymph node but the ligament and that she expects there to be an infection somewhere in the joints. Or along the ligaments or something like that.
The node in my throat, well very obvoiusly that is an infection, it's a huge bump and it hurts. She suspects mononucleosis. But I'm not tired enough for that. Nor do I have a fever. Then again this evening I had a slight fever and felt quite sick, so who knows.
Now for breast. She touched it and squashed it and I was like, okay, you just have fun miss. 
She then declared that she didn't find a thing and that means that what typically would be a tumor wasn't found and most certainly not where it usually would be.
So, I showed her the lump. And she was all 'oh, yeah, I see, but is that a lump? Mhmmm, I don't know"" and that was it. She didn't even go and check the underarm nodes.
I don't know if she was incompetent or just stupid.
Or whatever.
So she sent me to radiology to get an ultrasound and if that should show anything positive a mammography.
But the mammography instruments were undergoing reperations and whatsoever today.
So, I'm supposed to go back on monday.
Now I can wait a couple of days.
And wait.
Wait.

Don't even ask how Nano goes. I'm so not in a writing mood it's not even funny. I just feel like crawling into bed and dying. And that's bad. And I can't seem to snap out of it. I'm still at 4'000 words. If I don't go up to 10'000 by sunday, and 20'000 by next wednesday, then I don't know how to do this. Because right now I don't even know if I ever want to open the document again."

Now it's my arm again, even though my lymph node disappeared. I sound histrionic. And like I'm about to hyperchonder completely. Muscle is swollen again. My left breast is swollen. I'm also half certain there's a lump that doesn't belong there. Then again I haven't lost weight, but gained a lot and this bloody gain also makes it very much possible that the whole mistery of my pain is the weight actually. And then the hormones could be a reason for it being slightly lumpy, I don't know. It scares me, so doctor it is next week. I hate them.
Nano is going well, my wordcount is up to 4'000 and I haven't actually had time yet. So when I will have time, which will be now, with Belgium out of the way, then I will catch up and go strong.

Here, University started, lots of Psychology, lots of Freud, lots of very interesting things. It's a bit chaotic as no one quite knows where to go and what to do yet, but it's slowly getting somewhere. I think I got my timetable together and that it makes sense. At least I hope so. I have 22 hours per week and most of them are at 8 AM, which isn't to my liking. And there's so many books to read, it's scary. But I'll get through.

Work started too. They were happy to  have me back. It was a warm welcome and it made me feel really happy. Though work itself then was shitty because we had to do this survey where we weren't allowed to tell who the employer was and what product we're talking about, so the people were suspicious and tried to get out of it, which I can understand. So, it was really annoying. I hope that next week we've got something better."

We went to watch Step Up. I quite liked the movie, it was everything you expect off a dance movie. The typical story of course but good music and fantastic dancing. Exactly what I expected and how hot is that guy? I'd so totally hit it.

In Perth we did two roadtrips. The first one down south, 800 kilometers all in all, to the Treet Top Walk. I loved driving down there and the trees were amazing, even though it scared me a bit, walking over those swinging bridges. The next roadtrip was up north, to the Pinnacles. Quite impressive to be able to drive for hours and still being in the nowhere, only bush to your left and only bush to your right and the same to the front and the same behind.

Otherwise we watched 24, still one of my favourite shows. I adore the concept, it's new, it's interesting and it captures your attention for 24 hours straight, sleeping is not an option during a season of that show.

We were quite tired from the concert the night before. Placebo. They rocked my world so much, they made me cry, it was such an awesome concert. At first we were in the moshpit but the people got so crazy and started to push so much that we had to get out, and soon after they started to pull out one girl after the other, most of them way beyond being passed out.
After the concert we didn't even try to get our last train, it would have been impossible anyways. Instead we took the bus to Circular Quay and took photos of us in front of the Opera and the Bridge. Lovely at night.
They turn the bridge off at 1 AM. There's this hilarious moment: I took a picture of my woman with the bridge behind her and a minute later she takes one of me with the bridge behind me and I look at it and ask, where is it, are you too stupid to actually manage to get this huge bridge into the picture? And then we looked up and the bridge was gone. Gone. Lights off.
Then we walked up to Hyde Park where we went in search of Possums that we chased with the camera. Fun times.

On Friday we went to the Dresden Dolls concert. Again. We already were in Sydney and we had loved them so much we had to go back and see them again. They had this bloke with them, Jason Webley, he rocks so much. Such great music. He reminded me of Vladimir Vysotsky and sure as hell, the next day I checked him out on the net and he likes that guy too, so I knew I wasn't far off. The Red Paintings are with them on tour, they're good, not something I'd run to go and buy, but I like them lots. The singer is such a cutie. And how hot is Amanda? 

On Saturday we slept in again and boring stuffs like that, played Eye Toy too, such a cool game, I will snatch it off woman and take it home. So much fun.
On Sunday we went to Rockingham, beach, English Breakfast, oh I missed my English breakfast.

And today we went to Perth. King's Park. Fantastic view over the ocean. Sunny. Warm. Beautiful park. Spring. And then the best Fish and Chips. Now I am slightly sunburnt but who cares.

Off to watch a movie. Tomorrow Penguin's Island. Me excited."

A small concert, I don't know if classical or something else, and in the end I had to go and give the singer flowers, even though I don't remember if she really was a singer or if she was some violin player or something completely different; so to cut a long story short: I brought this chick flowers, but I have no clue who it was or why, it could even be my imagination. But I remember how terrified I was in front of all the people so I doubt that.
There are a lot of people I'd love to meet though, like the guys from Placebo. WHICH I'M GOING TO SEE LIVE IN LIKE 8 HOURS. I feel like a teenager, completely flipping because of that concert, I love the band so much.
There was a new discovery made too this week, friends dragged me to a Dresden Doll concert in Sydney, just after I spent the whole day walking around the city and Hyde Park. And they were absolutely amazing, so amazing that we'll be seeing them again this friday in Perth.
But today there is only Placebo. So excited, so, so, so excited!

So, these guys down here not only have a Prime Minister that sucks about as much as Mr. President of the United States does (he banned gay marriage, the first leader in the world to do so, I mean, gay marriage is not legal, so how about he doesn't change that, what's the sense in going to ban it? Think it's even more illegal than just not allowing it?) they also have temperatures that suck donkey balls.
It goes from awfully hot during the day, with a really strong and harmful sun to being icecold during the night. Their houses are made out of paper, the hotness of the sun going straight through turning them into ovens and the coldness of the night turning them into fridges. How is one not supposed to get sick in that?
Also it is very humid and I can't stand my shirt and my pants being so bloody wet and me sweating so bad and blah, enough complaining, back to treating myself with aspirin."

"event","So, I have been here for a whole week and have not really updated yet because the first thing we did was basically going to Queensland to tour through the themeparks before coming back to Sydney. But let us start at the beginning.
On Friday we basically did nothing at all. We went home to meet my woman's aunt and her cousin, gave them the gifts I brought and introduced myself and felt weird. I was feeling really sick the whole day because of the jet lag I guess. Dizzy and tired but wide awake in the morning and damn tired in the evenings. We wanted to go and see a movie in the evening but we found out that there would be no train back and so we gave up on that. (Yeah, woman lives so totally outside in the nowhere, I first thought I landed in the West of the United States, like Utah or something and was expecting to see an Indian walking towards me and greeting me at any moment.)
So we did the movie thing on saturday. Pirates of the Caribbean, the second one, I still want to marry Keira, it rocks so much.
And then there was another plane for me to take, this time only an hour flight, to the Gold Coast. When we arrived at the hotel, noone was there, the doors were locked and it took gf's brother to get this guy to come out and meet us and let us in. But then, 12th floor, right next to the beach with an awesome view all over the Ocean. Awesome. We have no Ocean in Switzerland so that was Paradise.
On Sunday we went to Movieworld. Rides, like Lethal Weapon where you hang and most of the time are upside down with your feet dangling towards the sky. And of course the new Supermanride, which just is so scary. I felt really bad during that night then, I think the stress got a bit too much, so we took the next day off.
Monday, we walked along the beach and just relaxed for a bit, watching Australian Idol, I know sad.
On Tuesday we went to Dreamworld. I did not dare to go onto the Giant Drop (120 meters up in the air, it just lets go and you drop) but I did dare to get onto the Tower of Terror, which turned out to be not anywhere close to terror. I cuddled a koala, stroked a Kangaroo, a snake and baby crocodiles!
That was a very exciting day with the Koala and all. It is so incredibly soft!
Wednesday was the day we went to Seaworld. Dolphins and Seals and lots of fun but we both grew a bit tired of themeparks and we did not want to give up our hotel room with the perfect view but we were really tired. So, going back to Sydney was not as bad.
Good advice from me, do not fly with Virgin. Never trust a brand that produces a drink and then thinks they also gotta produce aircrafts. They scared me. But, I guess that is not their fault, as I am scared of planes, oh wait, old news.
We got home late, had Donuts and other healthy food and then we went to sleep.
And now I am here, waiting for my gf to finish her lab session thing. Come on, faster, I am bored!"

"event","So, <a href=""http://shiveredsky.blogspot.com/"" target=""_blank"">XThe NavigatorX</a> talked about Arizona, which reminds me of the desert and of the sun. Just like predicted, those are the things that come to mind first of all, when hearing that name.
Which is kinda sad as we had to learn many more things about the United States at school. And I keep on noticing how I forget it all, the Latin, the Greek, Geography, History, it just vanishes as if my brain had a hole somewhere and lost information along my way.
Anyways I got reminded of the sun, meteorology and the kind.
I am confused down here, in Australia, where I am at the moment as everyone knows (I just felt like reminding people, I am still so excited).
It is winter. Yet the sun is hotter and more intensive than I have ever felt it and it is as hot as in Switzerland during summer. Also when you travel southwards it grows colder and when you move upwards towards the north warmer, whereas in Europe south means warm and north means freezing. (How sad is it that it took me some time to realise that the Equator is on the other side, or we are on the other side of the Equator, whichever way you choose to look at it.)
You get the feeling everything is upside down down under. I do have some difficulties adjusting to that.
Now let us move on to <a href=""http://www.dtkelly.net/"" target=""_blank"">Towerkel</a> and I will update later on with what has been going on down here.

"event","Ok, so I am having a really hard time figuring out that bloody keyboard, but I will survive. I am also feeling very dizzy which is really annoying. I am not tired but I did not have enough sleep, so I am really awfully unstable on this chair, half of the time I have the feeling I will be falling off very soon, if that should happen, no one will collect me, believe me, uncaring Australians. If they were caring, they would not have such weird keyboards, I tell you.

Flight was actually cool. We took off, I was so scared, but kind of excited and just kept on holding onto my seat repeating that nothing can happen to me, nothing can happen, nothing can happen. Well, nothing happened. I watched lots of movies. First Ice Age 2, then Friends, Malcom in the Middle, King Arthur (how much did that suck?) and Over the Hedge, plus then finally the Terminal (nearly as bad, bloody awful). After like two hours of flying I looked at the watch and I was like, 10 more hours, and I will only be in Malaysia, and it was an eternity already and I am only like 2 hours in. So boring, so very boring. Did not eat anything for the whole flight.
Malaysia airport is really nice! I liked it a lot. The second flight was ok too. I slept, I did not think I would be able to sleep on a plane but I managed without problem.

Then I arrived here and they did not even x-ray my bag. That amused me. I got through the borders without problem and then met my woman. We went past her university where this crazy chick jumped us. Seriously crazy, like beware crazy. But, apparently a very cool person, so that exists on that continent too.

Speaking of continents. I have been on all five now. Growing up in Europe, spending one week in America, spending three hours on Asian airport and now in Australia, I rock, I am all five-continental and proud.

But it is weird to imagine that now I am on the other side of the world, I do not think you can actually realise that you are so not where you normally are.

Can one have troubles with height differences the other way around. Like I know people that are not used to heights tend to have troubles when getting onto a mountain first time. But I just got onto zero meters and I am used to at least 700. Can that cause dizzyness? No? Mhm.

So, we went to the hotel and then we went to that bridge thing, the famous one in Sydney and to the Opera. By the way, how cool was the sight from the plane just before landing, it was already dark and it looked so bloody awesome! Pictures will follow as soon as I uploaded them.

For now that is all.

Please forgive my incoherence, style of writing and everything, as I said, reallz dizzy and probably jet lagged and incoherent, I feel drunk to be honest."

"event","Damnit, there's a spider next to my window and it's huge, it's bloody huge, I nearly stumbled backwards over my chair. Heh. So, anyways, we're the day before I fly and I'm bloody scared. I mean scared. I hate flying. I hate flights. I hate planes. I hate not having control. I hate not having ground underneath my feet. I hate, hate, hate sitting in a plane. I hate being scared. But I'm at my most scared in my whole entire life. Wonderful, especially knowing that the peak has yet to come, tomorrow, when I enter, or not, the bloody plane.
My back hurts, I'm all tense, my muscles are knots and I have troubles breathing and we're the day before, mind you. The day before.
Ok, so, I'm gonna pack now, because I'm probably the only woman on earth that manages to pack only 24 hours before the plane takes off. And that needs only one suitcase and doesn't even manage to fill it. I must be weird. Packing it is. I can do that. First step is packing. Second step is not eating. Third step is taking the train to the airport. Fourth step is deciding wether to check-in or not. Fourth step is not regretting the decision. Fifth step is check-in. Sixth step is throwing up. Seventh step is not going to the borders. Eigth step is E. pushing me through the borders. Ninth step is going through. Tenth step is not regretting that decision. Eleventh step is boarding the plane. Twelfth step is regretting that. And on number thirteen we die, freaking out, or something along those lines. Oh, happy day!"

"event","So, the people over <a href=""http://absolutewrite.com/forums/showthread.php?t=34458"" target=""_blank"">here</a> decided that I would be at the top of the third round of the Chain and then they started putting pressure onto me and when I'm pressured I can't write anymore, not that I could before. But with pressure nothing works. Nothing.
To save time, here's the last post of the last round: <a href=""http://everythingindian.blogspot.com/"" target=""_blank"">Judy</a>.
But I ended up deciding that I can't let those poor people wait and decided to just make one of those normal entries where you blab about God and the World and wonder why anyone should be interested in reading it. Other than your significant other who has to show some interest if they want to avoid a cranky woman.
And I'm not a lovely sight when cranky. Not at all.

Anyways, what I wanted to talk about is the World Cup.
Tonight C. and me will go out to watch the match Portugal against the Netherlands and I hope they will manage to win. If they win, they will end up against England in the next round, of course, only if England doesn't get thrown out by Ecuador (they just scored, so I doubt that).
I grew up being a Portugal fan, due to my father loving that team and he taught me just one thing in life: Figo is the best player there is. Now, Figo is 34 years old and I know it ain't true anymore, but for me it's still true.
What about Switzerland you wonder? Well, we did win the group. Even though we had France in with us, we still won it, this either shows how crappy France is this year or how good we are. I prefer to say, we are good! We will reach the quarters, I'm pretty sure, I doubt though it'll go any further.
Having seen how it looked like over here just by reaching this round, it'd be scary to have us go any further anyways.
Imagine a rather small country, rather calm people and suddenly everyone sees red and screams and suddenly you find out we do have people in this country, oh my god, where did they come from? Crazy!
On friday I went to watch the match out with a few friends, the Switzerland against South Korea one and in the end we only just escaped from the police and the battles they started to fight against the fans. I've never seen such a high amount of screaming people, never seen such a huge amount of people dressed in red and jumping around.
It's wonderful to watch how everyone suddenly comes together to cheer for one thing.
I wish we'd be more like this during the other 3 years of the year where there is no World Cup too.

"event","<a href=""http://kiraconnally.com/blog/"" target=""_blank"">Kira</a> made a very interesting post, as first post of the second chain, but it's hard to pick something out of it.
Maybe, I just had too much Champagne already, which, considering it's noon and no special day, is not that much of a good thing!
Let's pick ghosts.
I don't believe in ghosts and I never stumbled over a ghost, nor anything remotely simliar, except for my Gf, hiding in the pantry of my kitchen and jumping out at the worst possible moment.
But, when I was about five years old, I was lying in my bed, it must have been early morning and I already saw the curtains clearly, so it wasn't as dark anymore. Suddenly, they moved and a few moments afterwards something cold blew onto my throat. It was like, someone was standing behind me and just blew onto my neck, just that none was there. I froze. Then I started to scream for my mother.
Today still, I have no idea, if I was dreaming or imagining things. I doubt it was a ghost.
My life is upside down at the moment and I need to go to work soon, even though I should study, it's all so very annoying and time consuming.
Though, I doubt getting drunk at noon really is the right option.

So, <a href=""http://kiraconnally.com/blog/?p=230"" target=""_blank"">Kira</a> mentioned hotels, which made me think of Paris. That was the last time I was in a hotel, with my girlfriend, while on the outside there was rain and fog and clouds and most of all coldness. We still have awfully cold over here, if you consider it's june and it should be summer. So, hotels, we were talking about hotels. I used to love hotel rooms, my parents from very early on, let me have my own room, whenever we went somewhere and I loved that. I could watch TV, be up all night and read or talk to myself without anyone noticing or complaining. Then again, the next morning my eyes of course would betray that I didn't sleep, so there still was lots of complaining.
The nicest hotel room I've ever had was in England, in one of the national parks, in the middle of nowhere. Wherever you looked there was only grass, sheep, hills and fog. The houseitself was very spooky and I was convinced that if ghosts exist, if, then there. So, I have to admit I was somehow scared, alone in my room, in the foggy lands of the beautiful country of England. But, I loved it there. Of course, the same reason I love horror movies. Even though they freak me out and then I don't even dare to walk through our house without lights on.
The worst hotel room, I think, if I remember correctly was in France. Marseille. There were cockroaches. And it was smelly and old and I was glad we were gone again a few days later.
And, if we're already talking about gone a few days later.
The World Cup started and the first teams will be out soon and I can't even watch the matches, because there's no bloody TV in my apartment and I have to study and life sucks! Besides that work sucks big time during the World Cup, none listens to you, none wants to even pick up the phone, they ignore you or scream at you because you disturb their football fantasies. Damn them.
Anyways, I'm done.

<b>1. What did you miss most about AW - JUST ONE THING</b>
Not being able to get on there at every hour of the day and post as many posts as one can possibly post when one is as bored as me.

<b>2. What did you do when you were missing your AW fix?</b>
I was running to Roger's Camp but it was only half as much fun, so I tried to study, which didn't work out as well as I had planned, so I tried to write, but I'm suffering from this big block, blocking my writing, so I tried to eat, which worked out, so I took weight and I blame a certain agent for that.

<b>3. What new blogs or sites did you discover as a result of the shutdown?</b>
Nothing, to be honest I have enough sites in my favourites to be able to amuse myself for days. Mostly I was playing Browsergames like <a href=""http://www.hattrick.org"" target=""_blank"">Hattrick</a> and <a href=""http://www.island-monarchy.com"" target=""_blank"">Island Monarchy.</a>

<b>3a. Did you add a new blog to your blogroll or site to your bookmarks? (share if you'd like to)</b>
No, my links are still the same.

<b>4. Where did you comment that you'd never commented before?</b>
Nowhere. I'm a lazy commentator.

<b>5. What was your first post here when you made it back?</b>
Something along the lines of, yay, back, we're back, I missed you.

<b>6. Didja miss the Meme?</b>

Being already half sick, of course now I caught myself some annoying backpain. Unfair. My exams are getting closer but I'm too lazy to study and I'm bored. I've rarely ever been so bored. Maybe it's not even bored, but just not having pleasure doing anything. I find nothing I like doing lately. I'm just simply blah. And my head hurts again. Someone give me something to do, something I actually like doing and want to do. Whatever it may be. Just something that drags me out of this bored, unmotivated state."

"event","So, at work, we're doing the Swiss Labour Force Survey. It's pretty much showing how many people are employed, how many unemployed, how many young people without a job, how many pensioners still work, who works how many hours and so on.
Everyone answers the questions without many difficulties. But you ask Americans for just their birthdate and they bitch at you: They'd never ask you that in America.
Well, you are <b>NOT</b> in America? And here, we ask!
The best was, that chick, that kept hanging up on me, before I could even explain what I called her for.
So, one time, she doesn't hang up but screams at me. ""Why do you people keep calling me? What the fuck is it you want?"" And I, glad, I can finally say something: ""Trying to reach your husband. He got a letter from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (mind you, that's government, not anything, government) about the Swiss Labour Force Survey, which is being carried out on behalf of the Federal Council!""
Her answer?
""My husband doesn't care for your fucking surveys. We don't even <b>like</b> Switzerland!""
And hangs up.
Go back home? Like, fuck off, we don't like you either.
Now of course there are Germans and Swiss and Italians and all sorts of other people that are bloody impolite or downright rude.
And it's not only the Americans that think they can come here, live here, make money and say they don't care for the rest as long as they get their rent.
Fuckers.
Of course lovely is also: ""What's this for?""
""Like that problems on the Labour Market are recognized early and can be fought and dealt with. It is to help ensure that you and your children will have a job in future!""
""Oh, well, I do have a job, so I don't care for this!""
Fuckers!

"event","Picoult - My sister's keeper. Wonderful story, wonderfully set up and still a very bad book of an author that apparently can't write entries that are as strong as the book. And well known is: The ending makes the book more than the middle does. So bad endings give bad books. And bad books, indicate bad authors.

But let's take a look at the story.
A kid gets diagnosed with cancer, no perfectly matched donor around, so the parents get another kid, a designer kid, perfectly matched to save her sister.
One main question of the book is, if that's right. The book gives no answer, I agree with that. Because looking at it from the view of the parents, it's right to save their kid. Looking at it from the view of the little kid that now has to go through several medical procedures to save her sister, it's anything but right.
So when she's 13, her sister's kidneys give up and now she's supposed to donate a kidney. That's when she takes a lawyer and fights her parents to get the right to decide herself if she wants to donate this kidney.
Wonderfully set up.
The child that wants to save her sister, the mother that has been fighting 16 years for her child, the child that wants to decide herself what happens to her kidney, the child that would be forever loaded with guilt if her sister died because of not getting that kidney.
In the courtroom we find out that actually it was the sister that asked her not to donate her kidney. And it was her who said she wants to die and not live like this. Point is, she doesn't want to die, she just doesn't want to live like this anymore.
What to do?
The appointed guardian has no answer to the judge either.
Either way is losing.
She gives her kidney, the sister dies still, she's living with one kidney, for the rest of her life, for nothing.
She doesn't, the sister dies, she'll be loaded with guilt.
And the chances that everything goes well? Slim. And still, we here have a 13 years old that her whole life was without getting asked the one to save her sister with her own body and organs. And now she'd be without kidney. Fair? Not?
The judge gives the child her rights. In future she has to decide what will happen. Medically.
Still wonderful.
Now the ending. What to do?
It's difficult of course, you can only present an ending where more or less everyone loses.

Except for the author pulls a car accident out of her ass. So the thirteen years old dies, well, brain dead, of course, we need the kidney don't we? How convenient. The sister gets the kidney. And hey, 10 years later, Epilogue, she's still alive. All is well. Ain't it?
Advice to the author: Don't make the reader care for 400 pages for a 13 years old. Presenting all moral dilemma. Presenting how she's torn.  Don't get me to think for 400 pages, what would I do? Could I live with not giving a kidney? What happens if I do?
And then just kill her off.
It does not work like that. Bad trick. Cheap.
But then again, at least that's an author where I'll never have to read another book again.
There are already too many authors out there that are actually worth reading.
Too many, my life's too short for all of them.
So, I gladly strike one out."

I can snuggle deep into my blanket and it's so warm and nice, for once I'm not sweating and kicking it off, but searching to go deeper and I can feel how comfortable my bed is and then sleep.

First of all, Martina Hingis won against Williams. I can't stand that black bitch (no offense, but I'm politically just the most incorrect person when it comes to that thing on the tennis court) and now in the 21st match of the two, where both have won 10 so far, Hingis did it. I didn't think she would, I'm ashamed to say. The first set looked pretty awful. But then she pushed through! I consider it a miracle.

Then. Eurovision! The contest where every European country sends some more or less slutty and some more or less bad singing group to the city that won last time and there they sing for two hours, making all ears fall off and run away, yes that very contest was won by Finnland this year. Now, just Finnland doesn't sound too much like a miracle, does it? Then let me explain: It was Lordi. And to explain even further: <a href=""http://www.drakkar.de/images/lordi_pic_008.jpg"" target=""_blank""> This is Lordi!</a> I was on the phone with my mother when it was their turn and she asked me what kind of horrible music I was listening to and when I explained her it was Eurovision&nbsp; she was speechless, what the hell was Heavy Metal doing in a more or less country dominated contest? And then they won. It had me giggling for hours!

I didn't do anything for Uni again, what a surprise (there, sadly enough, still waiting for a miracle!) and I'm hungry. So, I be going to the fridge now.

And who knows, maybe a miracle happens and America drops Bush."

"event","I know, you didn't want to know that. Sorry for sharing. So I got myself a sexy Myspace, despite my swearing and promising that I'd never join the kindergarten over there. But what can you do when your Girlfriend asks you to join in &hearts; I know, I'm way too soft. I need to work on that.
So, I spend the better part of the day to try and get that space to look good, which is friggin' difficult as the ones that set the whole thing up made it nearly impossible to make something, anything, out of it. Anyways, I managed. And it looks good. And I like it. Now, I have a place to be stupid. God save us!

<lj-cut text=""The following is stolen:""> 

<b>Elaborate on your default icon.</b>
Do I have to? It's Martina Hingis. She's swiss. She rocks the tennis courts all over the world. Well, used to. I was like 12 back then and adored her. Now, I still adore her and hope she's back to kick some ass!

<b>What's your current relationship status?</b>
What are those? Specify? Is it like, dying, passionate, done, falling into, or things like that? Mine is weird, but the woman is weird, so I guess that fits.

<b>Ever have a near death experience?</b>
My girlfriend dragged me into that Space Mission rollercoaster in Dysneyland. I thought I'm going to die. Literally. So, yes. I blame her.

<b>Name an obvious quality you have.</b>
Intelligence. Of course that's obvious. Hush, shut up, go away. I said, go away? Damnit.

<b>What's the name of the song that's stuck in your head right now?</b>
Placebo - Because I Want You &hearts;

<b>Any celeb you would marry?</b>
Lena Olin. Give me!

<b>Who will cut and paste this first?</b>
I doubt anyone will ever copy and past this, I must be the only one that fills out such crap at midnight. Waiting for the gold to grow on your island on some browsergame. Yes, I'm sure, I'm the only one.

<b>Name someone with the same birthday as you.</b>
My aunt. Takes attention off me. Sucks.

<b>Do you have a crush on someone?</b>
Because I want you too! Because I want you too! Because I want you! &hearts;

<b>Have you ever vandalized someone's private property?</b>
Have I? I don't think so. I used to climb through all the gardens and find secret ways everywhere through, oh wait, I still go through private gardens, it's Girlfriend's fault, I swear. Anyways, if you call that vandalizing.

<b>Have you ever been in a fight?</b>
Yes. They're fun.

<b>Have you ever sung in front of a large audience?</b>
I don't think so. I wouldn't anyways. Ewww. My voice is awful. But I played the violine in front of a large audience. No fun.

<b>What's the first thing you notice about the opposite sex?</b>
Hands and muscles and eyes and lips and of course the ass.

<b>What do you usually order from Starbucks?</b>
Something with chocolate. Yummy.

<b>Have you ever hurt yourself on purpose?</b>
Yes. Who didn't? If anyone here can come to me and tell me he never punched a wall in frustration, or kicked a wall or did any of those stupid things where you end up going all, <i>ouch, it huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurts, I didn't mean to get huuuuuuuuuuuuurt, stupid wall!</i> I will personally hand him a bottle of beer.

<b>Say something totally random about yourself.</b>
I'm random. Oh, wasn't that random enough? But I!

<b>Has anyone ever said you looked like a celebrity?</b>
No. But some program once told me I look like Julio Iglesias and David Bowie, that scared me. More like traumatized me forever and ever. It also said I look like Natalie Portmann. But that's even scarier.

<b>Do you wear a watch? What kind?</b>
It broke about ten years ago, I was too lazy to go and get it fixed. Yes, still.

<b>Do you have anything pierced?</b>
Ears. But I want stomach. Though I can't anymore. I put on too much weight. So, it has to be eyebrows, but my mother would kill me!

<b>Do you have any tattoos?</b>
No. But I want one. Or two. Or another three. 

<b>Do you like pain?</b>
No one likes pain. Psychologically seen people who like pain just like to check if they're alive and still able to feel, like, anything. If they'd really like pain they wouldn't complain about random hurtings all over every few seconds.

<b>Do you like to shop?</b>
When my Girlfriend didn't use my money, yes.

<b>Do you know any twins?</b>
I do. One of them is dead though, does that still count?

<b>Do you have any weird relatives?</b>
My family is weird. Period.

<b>What was the last movie you watched?</b>
Cruel Intentions. Such a bad, bad, bad movie. But such excellent music and such excellent everything. It totally still rocks my shoes.

<b>What was the last book you read?</b>
The last one I finished? <i>Fingersmith</i> I think. I'm not sure.

<b>Did you or are you planning to go to college?</b>
I'm at University. Kicking and alive and not studying. Bad girl.

<b>What is your favorite pair of pants that you own?</b>
Jeans. From England. They're sex.

<b>Do you like to party?</b>
Yes. But I have none to party with. Depressing.

<b>Where do you see yourself in five years?</b>
Am I a psychic? No? So, why do you ask me where I see me? I don't see the future. I just, could imagine it. It includes sex!

I was thinking about doing my own mood theme, but I kinda like this one and on top it's green and I don't know but those TV-Show things annoy me, so I decided against it. Maybe next time. I like having my own stuffs on here and not something that someone else made.

I'm currently reading a bunch of books just to do this whole, <i>how did the Author get that effect across</i>, thing. It's quite interesting, just that I tend to forget about my question and just start reading and that's not the sense of the exercise. Particularly interesting is Stephen King. I just don't know how he does it. But he does it so well, it's amazing. He was the first author to scare me and the first to make me cry (IT + The Green Mile).

On the other side I'm convinced that Tad Williams can't write at all (ok, exaggeration, I admit!). But he's got good stories, so I guess that makes up for it.

I'm very tired but I know myself I'll be up playing God of War until I can't keep my eyes open anymore and then tomorrow I won't manage to get up. Then again, they stole us an hour this night, so annoying when you look at your computer clock and it skips from 1.59 to 3.00. I felt cheated.

"event","I seem to be suffering through the worst period full of no ideas ever since I started writing. I want to write, I always loved to write, I always had ideas, I still have ideas but I just can't seem to start anywhere. Everything sounds stupid to me, unimportant or simply not interesting.
I have no patience with myself but it's extremely frustrating if all you'd like to do is write something onto a piece of paper and all you manage to do is stare at the piece of paper for hours to no end. I used to flow with ideas, simply being able to write down everything and it seemed good.
Now I'm actually considering to write down an outline of what I plan on doing next. An Outline. I never used an outline before simply because I can't work with it. I used to always have more ideas and them flowing faster than the speed at which I wrote. Now I wish I would be able to write anything. An outline seems to be the forceful way of writing something and too linear, I'm not that orderly. Then again I've never been chaotic when it came to writing (surprisingly enough as I am chaotic everywhere else) and maybe I should just try it.
Usually when I have no clue what to write down I'm also not in the mood to write and when I'm clearly wanting to write I also know what about. But this time it's the need to write. But the paper stays blank. It's frustrating."

Yesterday I was in a waterpark with a friend. It was cool. My legs hurt though and my feet and I'm sunburnt and I hit my shin against the borders of the ice water pool. I think I tried to remove myself from it fast enough. So, I'm feeling more or less uncomfortable at the moment.

Ok, now, look at the new one. <a href=""http://www.20min.ch/diashow/2191/01445389.jpg"">Here.</a> What the hell?

Now, what would I get myself for christmas if I could.
<b>I-Pod.</b> I will get it probably way later next year, just before I go to Australia. If I have the money.
<b>Aston Martin.</b> Because I love that car.
<b>God of War.</b> Looks like such an awesome game.
<b>Max Payne.</b> Because I need to check that one out for myself, I've heard so much about it.
<b>Tekken.</b> Same reason as Max Payne. And I have a thing for Platin editions, I'm not into the plain ones. I'm weird like that.
The <b>Lord of the Rings</b> books in English. As I have a brandnew edition but in German.
A <b>Laptop.</b> Because I need one for Zurich. I might get that next year, <font color=""#25371c""><font size=""-4"">whenever I got a less expensive girlfriend that is.</font></font>
<b>Gilmore Girls</b> DVD's.
<b>Alias</b> DVD's.
I'll get me the <b>LOST</b> and <b>Desperate Housewives</b> ones myself.

<b>LOTR</b> DVD's. Extended Edition please.
<b>Kill Bill</b> DVD's. 
<b>Everwood</b> DVD's.

I need <b>rings.</b> I got two for thumbs, I got both my ringfingers covered, well will have soon, so I need more of those rings.

"event","So, I finally included schools into my list and I was pretty surprised when I found someone that had my old school from Fribourg on his list and on top I know him. I was pretty amazed at that. I also found a couple of people that go to University with me at the moment and I noticed that Switzerland has a lot of weird people.

I want to see that 4th Potter movie. But I only will in exactly 12 days. Friends of mine that saw it didn't like it as much as the 3rd one. Supposedly it's a nice best of, of the book with awesome special effects but just too rushed. I also still don't like Radcliffe and I doubt I will start liking him now. He can't act. He just simply can't. Emma overacts. But she's got talent. I hope she got even better and I hope there's some Snape in that movie. The actor is just fantastic.
I hope they cast the perfect actress for Umbridge in the next movie. They did so well in the first one. With everyone. Then in the second movie Mr. and Mrs. Weasly were just wrong, kind of at least. But Dobby was well done, so I forgave them the parents. Then in the third one Lupin and Sirius. Both not to my liking. Both not the way I had imagined them. And Trelawney. I always imagined her as a woman with style and elegance. And the new Dumbledore looks like a gay old man in an old woman's pyjama according to my friend E. And I agree with her. Maybe my expectations were too high after the wonderful cast of the first movie. Even the kids all looked the way I had imagined them. Even though I was disgusted by their acting. Now, I'm really curious to see how Voldemort turned out and hopefully Umbridge will turn out well.

I noticed today that I haven't roleplayed in ages. I kind of miss it. I should finish my Dan Brown book, it's still laying at home next to my bed and I just don't get anywhere. And I feel like rereading the Tolkien books but a friend of mine got them and apparently she threw coffee all over it and wants to buy me a new set of books or already has.
I'm also looking forward to seeing the Chronicles of Narnia. Even though I haven't read the book yet, but it's on my wishlist for Christmas. I wonder why no one over here in Europe has heard of or read those books. But the movie looks well done.
Walk the line is out soon. Maybe Phoenix is on his way for an Oscar. He'd deserve it.

Now I have to get home and eat something, I'm starving and in two hours I gotta leave for work already. Afterwards I'll meet E. for some dinner and a movie. We wanted to watch Alias but my computer didn't let me burn the episodes. So that'll have to wait.

That's it from me.

Oh, no, wait, I got a new phone! The Sony Ericcson z520i. It rocks and rules and most of all is purdy. And they gave it to me for 200 bucks. So it was a great deal!"

<i>When love beckons to you follow him, though his ways are hard and steep. And when his wings enfold you yield to him, though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. And when he speaks to you believe in him, though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.

Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you. You may give them your love but not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not their souls, for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.

There are those who give little of the much which they have - and they give it for recognition and their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome. And there are those who have little and give it all. These are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer is never empty. There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward. 

You have been told also life is darkness, and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary. And I say that life is indeed darkness save when there is urge, and all urge is blind save when there is knowledge, and all knowledge is vain save when there is work, and all work is empty save when there is love; and when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself, and to one another, and to God. And what is it to work with love? It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth. It is to build a house with affection, even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house. It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit.

Say not, ""I have found the truth,"" but rather, ""I have found a truth."" </i>

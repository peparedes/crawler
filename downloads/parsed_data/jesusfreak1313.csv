We waited like all day to get it and finally i got to take the test and I got a 91! woot woot! I haven't been getting good grades on things lately in school.  Just this week really but I guess it will pass, I don't know! Dad totaled the car today.  He ran a red light because he was closing his cell phone and wasn't looking and he hit a 90 year old woman (i think she was 90).  Everyone's fine but the cars ... not so much.  I'm gonna miss that car! We've had it since I was 4 ... Goodbye mister  ugly gray lexus .. you were so loved.  This might hinder my getting a car ... shnikes! Oh well! I hope Ivan doesn't hit us here! I'm not up for another power outage and freaking winds and stuff! It's too scary! Well It's bedtime! goodnight!"

"event","This came from a long line of theivery .. I stole this from Amy who stole it from Kevin who stole it from some girl named Morgan.  So here it goes: 

People are often unreasonable, illogical and self-centered; forgive them anyway. 
If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives; be kind anyway. 
If you are successful you will win some false friends and true enemies; succeed anyway.
If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you; be honest and frank anyway. 
What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight; build anyway. 
If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous; be happy anyway.
The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow; do good anyway.
Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough; give the world the best you have anyway. 
*You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and God: it was never between you and them anyway.*

I LOVE YOU!"

Jeez she was so gorgeous, its so sad.  Well I miss Hank in AP Chem but I hope he's coping.  Well anyway I had an AP Chem test on friday and it was horrible, I either did really well or really bad.  I hate those tests! We still have more testage on Monday because our time was cut short due to the pep rally.  My birthday rocked I didnt do much at all.  Nicole came swimming and on Sat. We went to Cheesecake factory and then My sister and a bunch of her friends came swimming!  Emily made me an original smoothie and it was yummy!

It was so fun they attacked Alex with cake and that didnt end well.  Laura will probably never wear her bra again and Arielle got more pink things for her birthday than I've ever seen in my life! Friday I went to the CHS football game.  That was an adventure! It started raining and like blowing dirt everywhere so we left cuz they cancelled the game. Then they uncancelled it so we came back! Then after a while it started pouring again and everyone ran undercover.  Laura, Alex, and I and some others stayed in the rain.  It kept coming and going so they finally decided to just play in the rain! It was so fun.  Alex Laura, Chris, Laura, Greg, Andy, Alex, and bunches of people were still there and we were all completely soaked.  CHS lost and my suede shoes are messed up i think and i had to walk through the frozen food aisle in Kroger while i was soaking wet.  It was worth it i think, I love the rain!  Well I'm going to the mall to get a present for Lydia who will me 17 on wensday! yay! I got ari would cool pink and girly stuff for her 16th b-day which is today! Mine is on Friday! yay!

I'm really missing CFO more than anything.  I don't think I've ever missed it THIS much!  I miss having people there to just talk stuff over with! There is ALWAYS someone willing to listen and that is so awesome. I dont really have anyone to talk on the phone with. *maybe I could call michelle?!*  I miss Michelle Treewater so much, I couldn't believe how just by praying with me that she knew and felt everything in my heart and I didnt even say a thing.  She was crying as much as I was and I'm sure she didn't know what about.  But it was so awesome she just helped me get rid of so much crap I held onto and now I'm like so excited to go to school and be a christian.

I got my Hanson slideshow thingie up in the lefthand corner.  And that comment thing I changed to ""2 weekends | shopping the five and dime""  its from a hanson song duh!  It was originally gonna be ""2 relationships gone | in an MMMbop"" But i changed my mind.  Who knows maybe I will change it back.  

I'm still mad at lindsey because she practically ruined my trip.  It could have been 100 times better if I had brought someone else with me! She was so rude!  Eric was trying to defend her but it wont work.  She drank beer with MY cousins who I NEVER get to see.    She ruined the little time I got to spend with them by being loud and obnoxious.  She ruined the time I had with my grandma who I may NEVER see again!  Then she was a jerk during the concert that I had brought her to New York for in the first place! She sat the whole time so I was on my own!! eerr!!!  I WAITED 7 YEARS FOR THIS CONCERT!!! AAHH!! So then she always had on her headphone in the car and at the park and all the time.  She is the biggest hypocrite I have ever met and she'll probably end up with an STD and in rehab.  My dad even thought she was kinda rude and that made me mad because he PAID for her to be there and she was disrespectful!!! Oh she made me so mad!!!!!!!!!!!!!  She always told stories to get attention and she bragged about touching the leg of a guy from LIT or getting the drumstick from Ben Jelens drummer.  She got that drumstick because I brought her to that concert.  THANKS LINDSEY FOR BEING A JERK!!!!! Oh well at least its over.  Dont get me wrong though I did have fun, but I'm still really upset over lindsey being such a jerk most of the time.  But God made her and therefore there must be something about her to like!

 But enough of that! Bedtime! Goodnight and God bless!  Tomorrow I may be over all this so dont hold this against me ... I have to get it out some way!!! JESUS LOVES YOU!!!!"

"event","Okay so I know its been a while but who really cares anyway!? So Russia was awesome! The people in our group got REALLY annoying (lydia can testify to that one!) but otherwise it was an awesome experience.  After Russia I hung around for the week and then there was CFO.  Can I explain CFO? Nope.  It was AWESOME x 100000000.  I let go of all my past.  I cried like a baby (slong with everyone else).  And I fell in love all over again with God!  Last year I was so on fire for God but I approached everything in the wrong way.  I lost one of the best friends I ever had because I told him he was going to hell and I gloated about not wanting a boyfriend and how I would be happier and then I ended up with a boyfriend.  This year I'm not doing what I think is right, but what God thinks is right.  I cant really explain CFO so I'll just put up with Amy said about it:

 ""Tons of things happened at CFO that I can't even hope to write them all down! God touched me like never before and I didnt even need to be slain or drunk or ANYTHING like that. I just stood in his prescence. .....It was a small turnout in the youth this year but the Algers, Ash, Amanda, Kim, the Pates, the Powers, Martin, Nick, the Wilburs, Michelle, Richard, this new kid Jacob, and a few others were all there. Amanda, Ash, and I shared a room and Spooning was the theme of the trip. Ash had an attitude prob but me and Amanda got along so well and we are now acountability partners. David and I got real close this week as did Kim, Amanda, Butch,  Jacob, Drew, and I as our littler group. There was so many giggles that I wont ever forget and it just rounded off the perfect week. Dancing in the rain, worshiping harder than ever, crying harder than i ever had ... watching David pop balloon after balloon, racing lil kids to take my own tray up, foot and back massages, TPing our own room, singing and dancing to ashlee simpson, winning the volleyball game, visiting Tina in the hospital when she had to leave midway thru to get her apendix taken out, and of course spending all night in the laundramat with David and Drew and Kim! Leaving was so hard to do and I cannot wait for next year's!""

I seriously despise having to eat now.  I felt so sick after eating I thought I would keel over and like die.  I hurt so bad I wouldn't have minded dying.  My dad said maybe I have an ulcer.  If I do then I wouldn't even second guess how i got it ... mom.  My mom drives me up the wall and back again!!  We haven't gotten along ... well ... ever.  Ever since I found out that she kicked my dad out of the house when I was little and like ban him from seeing me on my freaking 7th birthday!  I mean I remember it sort of but she lied to me then so I wasn't sure!  Oh I can't stand her!!!!!!!!!!! But enough of that she isnt worth my time, I have to get up at like 7:30 tomorrow morning.  We have to go to the 8 AM church service ad then to WaHo and then off to the airport we go!! We don't leave until 4 though!

"event","I thought I would share with you again this evening:
********************************************************
Candles burning low, lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice everywhere we go
Choirs singin' carols right outside my door 
All these things and more
That's what Christmas means to me my love

I see your smilin' face like I've never seen before
Though I love you madly, it seems I love you more
The little cards you give me will touch my heart for sure
All these things and more
That's what Christmas means to me my love

I feel like runnin' wild
Those angles and a little child
I caught you 'neath the mistletoe
I kiss you once then some more
I wish you a Merry Christmas baby
And Happy, Happy New Year

Let's deck the halls with holly singing Silent Night
Fill the tree with angel's hair and pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up just before daylight
All these things and more
That's what Christmas means to me my love
***************************************************************
So now in the NON season of Christmas ... Hanson and I wish you a Merry NON-Christmas >please read post below<"

"event","I AM SO TIRED! I 'slept' over at claudia's house last night and her brother and some of his friends were over there.  Nerio, Timmy, David, Claudia and I went to play basketball at Newtown.  Clauders and I went to see HP3 and then we got home at like 1:30.  Then Nerio, Claudia, David, Alex, and I went to go get bacon and eggs and whatnot.  Nerio egged David's and Alex's cars and Nerio said it was Cobb so then David egged Cobb's car.  It was so funny and Nerio had to hose down all the cars.  So then Cobb, David, and Nerio had a bacon cooking contest and we watched some movie, and I fell asleep.  Then when the movie was over at like 6 we sat around and finally got up and went to get breakfast.  Well we went to LaQuinta hotel, walked in the front door, ate breakfast, walked out.  It was so awesome.  Then Claudia and I watched Euro Trip and fell asleep.  That was my exciting day.

I got mad at my mom because I still think she likes my brother and sister more than me.  She always wants me to clean crap that no one is ever going to see and I find it pointless.  I'm the only one who wont take her crap and she can't stand it.  I DONT LIKE HER!! Well  I'm bored because ... well I just am.  So I'm going to go do something productive or not.  Adios Amigos"

"event","So it took me like a million years (okay one hour) to get to hear this country song thats been stuck in my head for like a week! I hate having to download music.  But anywho... This song is like ""I know what I was feelin' but what what I thinkin'"" Oh how true that turns out to be.  Things never turn out the way you think they will and then you end up doing something and you're like ""WHAT THE HECK WAS I THINKING?!"" Its so annoying because then you can't take it back. 

My ""what was i thinkin'"" moment was .. chris.  Geez that made me such a hypocrite.  I rambled on and on for like 6 months how I wasn't going to date and I wasn't gonna even kiss anyone until I was married.  Whoops.  So the worst was that we made out but still its like breaking a promise to myself and to the big G man.  It makes me so mad because I used to get a kick out of people asking me if I've ever kissed anyone and me saying ""no"" and they're all surprised.  I CANT SAY THAT ANYMORE.  oh well life will go on.

So anyway today was kinda boring I didnt do much.  My mom and I went to get a pedicure (fun!) and then went to the CONTAINER STORE to get stuff for my Russia trip! That was exciting.  Then dinnertime and now boring time.  That reminds me of the Banana cream pie i still have to finish! well I better go to bed I have to get up super duper early for church! adios!"

"event","So .... hmm ... I realised I had something interesting to say ... and now it seems to have run with the win created by my fan.  I suddenly had this strange urge to listen to Hanson Christmas songs!! CRAZY!! I listened to the whole christmas album like twice already!!  I seem to be growing more and more fond of them over time.  It's like I'll listen to them, then I sorta get bored of it.  Then I start listening to Ben Jelen or Twisted Sister etc. and obsess over them. Now I've picked up Hanson again and I'm so awestruck by their amazing talent.  NO ONE UNDERSTANDS!!! 

I miss school, sorta.  Summer is really kinda boring.  I can't WAIT to go to Russia!!! aahh!!! Janai is acting really bossy about the whole trip and its kinda bugging me.  Bobby, Nick and I were trying to figure out what to do.  I mean this is her first mission trip and I know she wants it to be perfect, but she doesn't realise that (1) nothing is going to work out the way she wants and (2) its most of our first missions too and we wanna have parts in it as well.  But oh well God will work it all out I'm sure!! 

My computer is being a buttmunch and 1/2!! The internet keeps crashing over and over again and I'm just about ready to shoot it!! aahh!! Well I haven't got anything else to ramble about so I'll leave! Much love"

"event","So yesterday (friday) I got up early and went to ADD testing.  That was fabulous....not.  Then later I went to Lindsey's and she wasn't home from the movies yet so I watched a Bruce Lee movie with her brother.  I'm guessing it was Bruce's last movie since he died in the making.  So Lindsey came home and she, Sasha, Eric, Mallory, and I went to the lock-in.        

We played laser tag at Q-zar and then went bowling and at the church we played on the inflatables.  The inflatables were definitely the coolest thing.  They had an inflatable slide and an inflatable obstacle course and this inflatable thing where you're tied to a bungee chord and you run really fast and it pulls you back! It was awesome! Eric ripped his jeans somewhere in the inflatables! It was so funny!  I never got to win in the obstacle course though :( It was sad. Then I fell asleep for an hour and I was leaned against poor Eric who couldn't move for an hour because of me. 

So then we went back to Lindsey's after her mom made 2 trips to pick us up because there were too many of us.  Sasha left and the 4 of us left had to sleep in lindsey's tiny tiny room!  Linz and I shared the tiny tiny bed.  Needless to say we didn't get much sleep.  I went to IHOP with my dad at like 1:30 and we went to some stores.  Then I came home and crashed from like 3:30 to 8.  Then I watched the History of Counterfeit money! That was exciting.

Well I;m sore from the inflatables and stuff and I'm sooo tired so I'll be going to bed now! Goodnight."

"event","So I'm sitting here trying to avoid studying! I don't do so well with that ... I don't like to think too much ;) ... So I was online today and all of a sudden I hear ""Come On"" by Ben Jelen start playing and I'm like ""weird?!"" because I looked and I had the Hanson cd in my computer.  Then I realise that it's coming from a website pop-up thing! It was so weird.  

I had 2 softball games last night, we won the first and lost the second (but its okay the second team was undefeated anyway).  Some girl slid into home and like kicked my leg with her spikes, 'twas painful.  Well anyway i got home at 9:30 and I had to work on my Hamlet paper and I stayed up 'til midnight then slept in until 8:45 and got up and finished. Then daddy and I went to IHOP and then i was off to school (Where we didn't to anything!).  So it was an okay day I suppose. I fell asleep watching TV so I better start studying!! Bye!"

"event","Today was rather uneventful.  I take that back.  I woke up like 5 times from 8 until 12:30!  Then I finally got up and at 2 I went with Lydia to this house tour thing to raise money for our Russia Trip! I'm really sad because something is wrong with Lydia and I wish I could help, but she wont tell me whats wrong.  I don't wanna butt into her life so much where I get annoying so I'll just be here until she talks to me.  So I'm going out to dinner soon and I haven't much else to say! Much love to the little guys!! ~Kimmian"

"event","I made one of these nifty things!! I thought to myself ""Why not let everyone read about my life?"" I'm just so interesting! Who am I talking to anyway?? Oh well I will tell you about my weekend! I spent the night at Nicole's house and we went to eat and then watched TV.  Apparently I fell asleep on the couch and when Nicole tried to wake me up I started rambling about eggs and balls or something! Strange! I don't remember that but oh well! We woke up and ate bacon and watched part of ""Anger Management""  Then I came home and watched the last hour of ""The Ring""  I guess that was a bad idea because I had no idea what was going on, it was strange.  I was sad that the guy died, I liked him! 

Well, daddy and I went to go play softball at ERP and I pitched! It was so hot though that we only stayed a little while! It was so hot I could barely hit the ball!  Well then my daddy let me drive around and we ended up somewhere in Cobb county! 'Twas funny! Then we went to dinner and we went to target to get a patio set but we couldnt get in touch with Trevie to bring it home for us so we just played softball in Target! It was fun! Then I came  home and here I am!! 

As summer approaches I get more and more excited about all the fun stuff I am going to do!! I'm going to Russia June 13-27! Then CFO is July4-10! This will be my 10th year going!! HOW FUN! I love all my friends there and my Jesus there! It rocks my socks! 

Then soon soon after that I'm going to New York/New Jersey with Lindsey to see HANSON, go on rides, go to the beach, visit Grandma, do fun New York things, etc.  I'm SOO excited about seeing Hanson! I love them so much!! Lindsey is the coolest person, we went to Florida on spring break and I didn't get sick of her at all! I usually get sick of people so easily!! I guess it's because its so routinely annoying to be around someone for so long! but Lindsey, on the other hand, I can deal with for a long time!!  

Well then sometime around the summer I'm going to Florida and HOPEFULLY Colorado. I've been trying to get to Colorado for 3 years now and it doesn't look promising this year.  I will be the happiest girl if I get to go! Well I'm tired so Goodnight!

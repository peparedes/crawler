"event","So basically... I decided to start using this thing...AGAIN. lol. Let's Talk About My Weekend... 

<center><b>Friday</b></center>

School was usual. At 7, Me, Nick, Dottie, Ali, and Ec... met up with Nina, Pom and Brandon and Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Sclater at Jmoneys last homegame. Afterwards, All of us plus Jmoney and Minus Mrs. Brown and Sclater went to Applebees. We saw Jamal Prather there... it was weird. lol. After that Me, Ali, Amber, Jmoney and Nick went off roading in the element... Me, Ali and Nick were in the backseat when Jmoney went over some tracks at 80 MPH... well lets see... i almost broke my jaw... Ali's ""12 pound head"" (as Nick calls it) hit nicks rib cage full force, and Ali's Neck was hurting. So then we dropped everyone off and I came home. Like 20 minutes later, I IMed Nick to see if his chest was okay and we both decided we were bored as hell and that he was going to come over and watch a movie. When he got here it was about 1 am... and we decided to watch ""Sweet Home Alabama""... Then his ass decided he was hungry and so I made him a Ham and Cheese Sandwich and We both ended up falling asleep. 

<center><b>Saturday</b></center>

Woke up at around 10:30 and decided to make breakfast for me and lil grey boy. lol. So I Made cinnomon rolls and Ali came over. After we ate... we came upstairs and nick checked his myspace and Me and Ali just talked. Then Nick decided the pack of gum I found on my floor was his... so then we faught and well.. i moreless got my ass whooped because he is strong as hell. lol. Then him and Ali went home. I then layed around for a little while, got ready, Jmoney came over, and then we went to pick Nick up from work. After that... I dropped him off... and Jmoney came over for a little bit, then left. I then hear a big BOOM and I look out my window and hear someone running... Someone egged my house. BIG MISTAKE. I have an idea... but im sure i will find out.. and when i do.. there ass is mine. However, after that... Jmoney and Me went and picked up Nick and we went to Tim Hortons for an Ice Capp, and Meijers. At Meijers... Me and Nick were reading Magazines while Jmoney decided she would read us and the whole store Dr. Suess. Lol. When we left there... We dropped Nick Off at Benavides house where Heather and everyone was gettin Crunk at.(Thanks Jes for inviting me by the way.) After we dropped him off... Jmoney dropped me off...and I passed out. lol.

<center><b>Sunday</b></center>

Today...Dottie and Jmoney came over for a little bit. We watched the ""Gilmore Girl"" Marathon.. and ate IMOAN fried chicken. Then they left... and Nay Nay and my Aunt Sally came over for a bit. Then Ali out of no where at 11 comes busting thru my door with an orange cone and left. LMAO. It was amusing. Then I talked to her on the phone for a lil bit and here I am now... 

I'm going to bed now... Until tomorrow...<3"

"event","Wow. So since July... ALOT has changed. I quit both jobs.. it was just too much, and too little money. I now get along with Amy. My hair is Blonde! Me and Ralph arent half as close, since he began dating Arlesia(Not saying its her fault.) Paul completely broke my heart. TWICE. He does not care at all for me. I am finally getting over it. School is great. Love being a senior! Idk... everything is going good... for now..lol."

"event","Okay so... I am sittin in 2 hour talkin to jessica cantrell about ms. bramble. (Mind you amy sits kitty corner from me)So I say... ""bramble fuckin plays favoritism...(cuz she was callin a bunch of peoples houses) Amy who i end up findin out planned to fight me that day, butts in and says "" and who are you refering to?""... i look at her like shes crazy and simply say, ""dont talk to me, member, i'll get suspended"" (cuz she went to like 4 administators and teachers about me... just tryin to get me suspended)... she then says... ""well then tell me who the FUCK ur referring to""... i then tell her quite loudly enough to stop the class and look..."" BITCH dont try to boss up on me!"". I then turn around and continue my convo with jessica. Next thing i know i see my stuff off my desk and on the ground... i turn to look and amy tips my desk! I go to get up and she pushes me back down. I then get up... tell ec to ""HOLD MY MOTHER FUCKIN GLASSES"" and out of no where bramble tackles me against the board, while ms. gibbs is holding amy. I got amy tryin to act hard and say ""now what bitch"" while bramble is telling me... ""DONT DO IT SALLY!"" I then decided i wasnt goin out like a punk and pushed ms. gibbs and bramble out of my way and it was then that i punched amy straight in the middle of her face... my most proudest punch!!! Amy then grabs my hair(pussy fighting!) and trips me... i fall on my back... she jumps on top of me... and slaps me... one good time... i'll admit, it was a good slap. But then it all ended for her right then and there. I wrapped her hair in a knot with my left hand, and punched her AT LEAST 25 times in her face with my right. Next thing i know, mrs. cannon is on top of me holding my left arm down while i am STILL punchin amy with my right...all i hear is "" STOP SALLY...STOP SALLY""... finally seeing only mrs. cannon i snap out of it and get up. It's then that i see amy go after ec. I then try to go after amy again to help ec... cuz amy gave her the rick james bitchslap... but my best friend proved everyone wrong, when she started beatin the fuck out of amy herself!!!! So mrs. cannon escorts me out of the room and to the 2 floor office... i have people who left there class to see the fight slappin my hands and tellin me good job and shit. lol. Mrs. cannon then tells me that i punched her in her face... not knowing, i apologize and she says its okay. I go and sit in mr.morgans office and ms. pallagi(amys aunt/hall monitor) walks in and gives me a lil AHHGG sorda sound... i figure, i'm gonna get suspended anyways and look at her, flinch and say ""what the fuck you looking at?""... she then walks out... long story short... Me and Ec got 5 days... amy got expelled... and i cant run for president...

Was it worth it... HELL YES!!! That has to be one of the proudest moments in my entire life... BOTTOM LINE!!! <3"

Paula came in with her 20 something year old boyfriend, who she left home to live with... she dropped out and she just looks different. Its sad to see your childhood friend so different. So that really got to me... i feel i cant help her. Anyhow, i worked 7 hours today, i am gonna go to crystals in a bit cuz i got to babysit tomorrow till 3:30 so i figured i mine as well stay the night. I tried venting to amber on the phone but she either kept saying hold on or let me call you back. VERY FUSTRATING... like she doesnt want to listen or doesnt care to! Then E.C... people tell me whats shes saying... how she feels toward me... yet when i ask her she denies anything... bullshit! Well its getting late, and a shower before crystals would be fantastic, so until later...

So i read it to the other counseler and she started crying...lol... i think it meant she liked it. lol. Then i ms. benford our principal had me come down to her office for a lecture, cuz amys bitch ass told her all this shit i didnt do, i didnt get in trouble tho! But i did start crying cuz i hate being made out to be the bad guy, and then my eyes were all red and swollen, and i see amy and she fuckin starts cheesin in my face, luckily i didnt hit her...

"event","Well today i got a late start. I feel like shit, due to some fucked up cold thingy. I was planning on stayin home, but amber came in my room at 7:10 and jumped on my bed, so i had to get up and do her hair, so i just went to school. Nothing exciting happened really, slept 6 hour. BUt sally have a perfectly DECENT day... thats impossible. I walk to my locker after school to see paul and E.c. at it. So hey maybe they are wiatin for me... PAUL... YAY!!! I get to my locker, he pulls out his phone and they walk away from me, while ec gives him all the numbers she has. Ok, shoot me. So ec asks for a ride home afterwards, and me being sad about the whole situation and being a smart ass tell her ""why isnt PAUL walking you home"", so i end of giving pom, nina, amber, brandon, ec, myself, rides home, and my moms driving. Thats SEVEN people in a lil ass nova that fits 5. It was funny tho, amber almost fell out the window. lol. So today was pauls birthday, i was gonna do something real kool like bring a balloon and a card with his present in it, but being sick, i FORGOT! Oh well, why put sucha big effort into something i will never have again. So he invited me to his party at his house on saturday at 5, but idk if i am gonna go cuz i got softball districts that day. I wish he wouldnt judge me from 8th grade like hes been doin. He has no idea how different i am. He forgets about all the girls who actually cared for him when he wasnt so attractive. SHALLOW! That sorda realy hurts... but hey thats my life... always got some kind of fucked up problems! oh well... guess i will see what kind of day tomorrow will bring..."

"event","Where to start... I feel as though I am nothing but an advice giver to friends. I am the one they always come to when they have problems in a relationship, and I give them the best advice I can. But why do they come to me? I have never had a real serious relationship with a guy before. Who knows. Anyways, I feel like I can't like anyone anymore, without a friend liking them. I only like certain guys, guys with a good outlook, someone who I know will do well in the future. I am not one to judge the guy I like on all looks. EVen though it is a plus. However, It always comes down to be just being the friend, and my girls always getting the guys. I've always just shook it off, but I feel I just cant hold it in any longer. I liked Thomas, he's a great guy, a gentleman, and he speaks two words and you know he's going somewhere in the future. We had great conversations, convo's I looked forward to everyday. But then, I find out him and my BEST friend amber like eachother AGAIN... the 5th time! I always support my friends, and he's just a crush. So what's there to do? I get upset, emotionally wrecked. I feel betrayed, like it was my fault. Now things are somewhat normal between me and amber, I mean i still feel like I can't trust her with things. As for thomas, I realized that I had more then a crush, I had a real great friendship with him. A friendship which is now, not at all what it was. It's sorda just a big mess. So there's ONE. Now, I liked Paul also. I've always had feelings for that kid. He's a gentleman, and he's intellegent, just my type. Well, which friend is going to like this crush now? Ahhh... E.C., my BEST friend. Only she dont sneak about it, she flirts and talks and stuff in front of my face. Of course, out of us two, whos the guy to like... my friend, never sally! So I just let it go, always, and try to let it go. But you get the feelings to go away, and then you talk to the guy and all the feelings of you liking them come right back. I dont know about my friends, but I know I am not going after the guys for their car, money, looks...etc. I feel i needed to get this off my chest, the hurt I feel everytime I allow myself to like someone, and one of the two BEST friends I have like the guys I like. Just goes to show I always just get to be the Friend, and always the one to give advice... IDK... I just dont know about allowing myself to like someone again..."

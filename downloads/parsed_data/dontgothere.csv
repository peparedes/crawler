"event","so, many people have asked me what has happened to me in the past few months. i don't like talking about my feelings. i don't like talking about whats going on in my head. hell, i don't even like thinking these things that i do. 

i've hurt a few people in ways that i can't describe. i was doing too much planning in my head. i was getting ahead of myself. i would think its ok if i don't eat today, i'll just eat extra tomorrow. having that empty feeling in my stomach felt good. it took over every other empty feeling i was feeling. it was something that i could control. and it made me feel good. until it went to far. so not eating one day, turned to not eating for two days. then on the third day was when i would eat. a lot. and then throw it all up. then the drinking phase came back.

i tried to drown all my feelings and emotions and problems away with alcohol. well, alcohol + no food = bad. then i disappeared for a few days. i honestly don't even know where i went. yes, i literally disappeared. i didn't come home or go to work, call any of my friends for 3 days. no one saw me, no one knew where i was. i went to my secret place. pretended i was 13, and my father was abusing me, so i had to run away. then i visited my mom. i swear she was right there with me. she told me everything was going to be ok. told me to go home. and that she would be waiting for me. so i went home, but of course my mom was not there. 

then i had a panic attack. i think it was really a heart attack. and i got rushed to the emergency room. i was let out that same night. i went for a drive to clear my head. sometimes driving is such solace for me. but i was out of my head and then next thing i knew my car was in a ditch, smoking and all banged up. i didn't know how i got there or what happened. and who knows why i wasn't hurt. there wasn't a bruise or a scratch on me. i was in the hospital two times in one night.

wait it gets better. after that episode. i thought that either someone really wants me dead, or an angel is watching over me. so i took a rest from everything. i layed in bed for 6 days. i just wanted to make sure that the devil wasn't going to fuck with me again. 6 days later and everything seemed fine. i went to work. everyone was happy to see me. my boss even told me that he was going to give me a raise. so that night a few friends from work and i went out to celebrate my raise. we hit up a few bars. then i went home. i had a lot to drink (4 shots, 3 mixed drinks and prolly about 5 beers), but i wasn't drunk. i decided that i needed to be drunk. so i drank until i couldn't see. half a bottle of vodka later and i found myself dry heaving in the bathroom. then i passed out and when i woke up i had tubes in my nose and i was in the hospital once again. the devil got me.

they had to pump my stomach. let me tell you just how much that is the worst fucking thing ever. im sure back in the 70's it was much worse (scene from almost famous- an actual tube getting shoved down your throat), now its just the tube in your nose and shit. good thing my roommate found me. fink, how can i ever repay you. you saved my life. 

so then things we're pretty calm. well calm to the past few weeks that i was having. i was still depressed and not eating right, but no more hospital visits, which is a good thing, because when the nurses know you by name, thats pretty bad. but one night i just flipped. and grabbed a razor. the rest you can figure out. 

i can't say that i'm happy, because i'm not. i can't lie about it anymore. i can't hide it. i can't drink away my sorrows. i can't use drugs to escape reality anymore. i still hate myself and i still hate that i'm doing this to myself, but i'm getting help. and thats what counts right? maybe this time the help will be good."

"event","is this right? is this the place? is this where my future stands? i can't explain anymore then i feel. i don't know where to place my hands anymore. the dredging feeling over my heart lingers on and on. so many memories i wish to erase. too many points i would like to return to. so much i wish to replace. 

i try to point my finger on the one thing that made me this way, but there isn't one. i can't control the things i do to myself. shaking, steadily staring into nothing. rocking back and forth. the emptyness doesn't subside. i can't think of you without crying. i can't think back to the love that we once had or could have had and not feel this rush of anguish. 

i work myself up too much. i don't know whats true. i don't know whats not false. i don't know whats real anymore. i don't know how to feel. more then half the time i can't even feel my toes. i don't know how i can go on in life anymore. i don't know what to make of myself anymore. i don't know what to say to you. i don't know how to make it right. i don't know if i'm real at all."

"event","i wanted to write something magical. i wanted my thoughts and feelings to just spill out into my fingertips and type everything that ive ever wanted to say. i wanted all of my emotions to be known and for every bleeding part of my soul to spill open. 

i wanted to write everything that ive ever wanted to say to you. and make it so wonderful. i wanted to tell you everything that i was feeling and all the things i wish i could have changed, done differently. but i didn't and i cant. i dont know how to make the words come out. and now all that we say we had were ""i wish we hads"" i dont want i wish we hads. but i dont know what it is that i do want. 



<b>::end transmission::</b>



im tired of things being so good for me and then going wrong. im not moving to canada. im never going to move to canada. george and i had a fight this week and i found out some things that i didnt really want to find out. and me being the emotional person that i am, i got really upset, but not because of those things that he told me, because of other things. i had another emotional breakdown. and last time that happened.. well lets just say that it was not good. im tired of me being me. i cant place myself these days. theres just so many things that i dont understand and i try to make myself understand them and then i start thinking too much. and it all goes downhill from there. i just dont know where to place my thoughts anymore. why cant every aspect of my life be perfect at the same time? if one thing is extremely good then of course something else must be totally bad. i cant take the uneveness anymore. its driving me insane. and its so hard to try and explain things to people, about how the way you use to be and how thats why you are the way that you are now. and you cant explain it because thats just how it is. its because of things that happened to you in your past. its those things that make you do the things that you do now. and when you open up and want comfort and theres no one there to comfort you or the person you want to be comforted by doesnt know how to comfort you and show you the emotion that you need. thats when you know its not meant to be. and why cant the person that i know that would be there to comfort me live next door? 

why cant new friends understand you the way that you need to be understood? and why did i push so many people out of my life? how did i end up here on the other side of the world? why did i fly so far? it takes so much out of me everyday. ive fucking stabbed myself in the chest every dam day for the past fucking 2 or so years. and then i erased all my emotions. i didnt give a dam about anything. not even myself. if i had a gun i would have put the trigger to my head a long time ago. my emotions are slowly returning to me, because ive been betrayed. all over again. like before? maybe more? 

im a complete utter mess.


ive been working all day and im fucking tired and even though its fucking 12 midnight on a friday night im going to bed to listen to bright eyes and mineral and to fucking make myself more upset. because thats the best thing im good at."

"event","so im not sick anymore, which is really good. i was sick all last week. but i finally dragged myself to the doctors on thursday and got medicine and made myself all better. being at work last week was the worst thing ever. today i have off which is the best thing ever though! 

so im really trying to figure out what to do with myself lately. im totally stuck in a rut these past few weeks/months. i really need to get on the ball, go back to school and possibly start working out. other then those things george has been an impending pressure on my mind. he got made an offer with some record label in canada. the only added bonus would be that he would get paid more, and seeing as he has been struggling with money lately, he could sure use more of it. he doesn't really like many of the bands on the label, c. media is more his style, but he keeps talking about the extra money. plus i've heard that its way cheaper to live out there.

anyway, he hasnt made a decision yet, but he has asked me if i would possibly want to go with him. its really hard for me to make a decision. the past two years of my life have been hell. my mom died, ive moved 3 times, been treated so shitty by people that i thought loved me, gone to rehab, and now finally after so many trials and tribulations i think i may have finally found a home. and once again, it may be uprooted. i just want some calmity in my life. i just want to be at ease with what the world throws at me. i really like george, i care about him a lot, but i just dont know if he is worth it all.

ive found people that i can rely on here. i have a great job, two great jobs, even though working all the time sucks, it feels really good to have financial stability. i work with great people. i could even say that i have found family. ive never had that before. ive never had people that needed me and that ive needed too. its a feeling of comfort. 

i just don't know where to start. my life has just been like start, stop, begin again. and now its smooth sailing. i want to be with the people i care most about, and those that care about me. i know george cares about me, most likely more then i care about him. he would do anything for me at the drop of a hat, but i need more then that. i dont want to leave those that have so welcomed me into their life. 

this may sound selfish, but i hope george doesnt leave. i need him here. and im not ready to pack up my possessions and move somewhere unfamiliar."

"event","i was updating before and being the big retard that i am i clicked the x and now i have to start all over. i was writing a pretty damned good post too. blow!

anyway, since i had like no friends before i added some. hope they don't mind. :) tonight was girls night out, or girls night in. we just hung out at my place and talked. it was nice and refreshing to just hang with the girls. staying up till the wee hours of the morning is fun. i think we should do it more often. i still have peach cobbler boones left, why do i so nurse the bottle? hahaha.

a few weekends ago i met two really amazing people. william and diane. they came out here to visit a friend who happened to be a friend of mine. what's funny was that i have been talking to william online for the longest time and didn't know the connection. its really funny. they are both from ny, but are going to move to ca, because i said so! i hope they come back again soon. they are really fun to be around. and william gave me the code so i could start this whole thing.

lately george has been acting really nice to me, which is great and all, but still no matter how much i think i could be with him, i always have this one person in the back of my mind. i don't know. maybe its just me, but i don't think our connection has been disconnected. maybe im wrong. maybe im just crazy. 

william has also been impounding it into my mind that i need to be straight edge again. thats something i have been dealing with for so long now. at least drugs are no longer a part of my life. but the alcohol lures me in. and so does george he is not a good influence on me at all. hahaha. at least he doesn't pressure me into drinking, or well not too much. hahaha. i like george, hes really great to hang with, an all-round nice, sweet guy. very hilarious at times, very cute and smart. and he gets me into shows for free, which is an added bonus, but not something i will consider in the ""should i or shouldn't i be committed to george"" syndrome. he travels a lot which would mean i could travel with him, but again, something crawls out from the back of my mind. oh well. 

its nearly 5am, good thing i don't have to work today, but that doesn't mean i should stay up any later then i already have, but now i am hungry. dam stomach. i've been gaining soooo much weight lately. i guess because i finally have money to eat. ive been making mad tips lately. but it still sucks working all the time and working two dam jobs. argh. maybe once i save up a lot i can go back and finish school. i'd love to go back to wp or even rider, but thats back on the east coast and i don't think im ready for that yet. u of w was okay, but i never found my place there, and had to drop out for... well reasons. errr ill leave that story for the next entry or some after.

anywhoo yes its now bed time. im going to sleep with my kittie.
goodnight live journal world. xoxoxoxoxox"

"event","i guess the most exicting news for me is i'm starting back to college full time next week. i'm abit nervous it has been it has been about 15 years. this is a gift of being clean. right now i'm at the comminty college in the general studies program. i think iwill transfer into the business program. 
 the past couple of weeks i have been have the odd sensation of waking up out of a long dream. i guess in sense that is true. i was in a dream/fog for many years do to my using. they say it takes close to a year and half to totally detoxify. maybe this is where this feeling is coming from. but i find myself noticing things that i have never paid any attention too. glances, interaction between people, a sense of purpose within people. can't really describe it.
 i feel like i'm starting out with life fifteen year late. like i was abduvted by aliens and placed back on earth. it is kinda sureal to me. 
 as far as school goes, it is one good thing that my partying did for me is know i'm getting school for free. thank the goverment programs. it is rehabitlating me. i'm getting to old for manual labor and i need a career not just a job, hence the schooling. i hope i can keep the desire i have to do well up, this is a great chance for me to better myself. this is part of where my nerveousness is coming from and the sense of failure for that is my pattern. i have been told that the fear is natural and healthy. and it is growth.
 the other bit of news with me is that i got elected to the board of CUFF my fetish group i'm a member of. i had been active with them and attend board meetings regularlly for awhile even though i wasn't on the board. i have someone to thank for instilling in me the need to give back to the community as it has given so much to me. thanks S.
 well who know when i will write again. i seem to write when i'm hurting more, the need for a release. i guess this mkeans i have been fair-to-midlin. 
 till next time
  peace"

In Buddhism, there are Four Noble Truths: (1) Life is suffering. (2) All suffering is caused by ignorance of the nature of reality and the craving, attachment, and grasping that result from such ignorance. (3) Suffering can be ended by overcoming ignorance and attachment. (4) The path to the suppression of suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path, which consists of right views, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right-mindedness, and right contemplation. These eight are usually divided into three categories that base the Buddhist faith: morality, wisdom, and samadhi, or concentration. In Buddhism, there is no hierarchy, nor caste system; the Buddha taught that one's spiritual worth is not based on birth.<br><br><table border='0' width='300' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Buddhism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='83' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>83%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>agnosticism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='83' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>83%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Paganism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='79' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>79%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Satanism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='79' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>79%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Hinduism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='71' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>71%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Judaism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='54' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>54%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Islam</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='50' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>50%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Christianity</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='42' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>42%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>atheism</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='29' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>29%</font></td></tr></td></tr></table><br><a href='http://quizfarm.com/test.php?q_id=10907'>Which religion is the right one for you?

 so i'm unemployed at this moment. 
 wnet to drive a friend to richmond for a doctor appointment on monday and my transmission went out on my car at the laumbardy bridge of 64/95. that was fun! i want to get mad but the damn tools of NA. i'm down but not raging. maybe it hasn't hit me yet. been hiding in bridge or sleeping.
 i'm sick, so sleep is a good thing.

 i have been spiritually bankrupt this week and have not been taking care of myself. i have been on a ""dry drunk"" 
 i had three phone calls this evening. and through the course each asked if i was attending the meeting tonight. each for a diffrent reason. so i went and a friends plans for tommorrow got all screwed up. he is without a ride to the speaker jam in fredericksburg. this is where he had gotten clean and took off work for it. so i took it as an omen to go.
 i was not planning on going at all. but if something is percevid as an omen, i listen, generally to my instinct. so i need to get to sleep, hah, mega coffee before the meeting.
 speakers tomorrow from 10 til 5. maybe that is the dose i need right now for my recovery

 while playing i debated about going to a play party. the whole day. the theme was school. i went shopping for a red plaid skirt and couldn't find one. i was really bum. i was anxious about attending any way. social situations awarkard for me. not knowing any one really well.
 so idrove into town around the time of hte early meeting and about the same time i would have to head towards the party anyway, still haven't decided on weather to attend.
 i started headeding there thought about turning around a few times. but i attended. it was fun. i didn't attend ""classes"" but it was funny as hell to watch.
 i did end up playing. hmmmmmm dreamy fun. i was co-topped. it had been way to long. very needed. lets just say i was purring howling and growling. then they figuerd out i was ticklelish. evil i say just evil, beat my all you want but please don't tickle me.
 sun i played more bridge then went to town to do some writing on my step work. that didn't happen. i returned aphone call from sat. and ended up playing chess.
 another friend called, he had a migraine and was at the emergancy room. they wouldn't treat him until someone showed up to drive him home. so i spent two hours at the hostpital. i hate them. we spent the evening together. i glad he is feeling better.
 i hope it rains tom. i need to do some step work, before wend.
  arrrg i'm sore and in the need of sleep.

 i have a year, no changes right away. though i did move again. my landlady tried to increase my rent 25% in the middle of winter. it like trying to squeeze water from stone. the money wasn't there. no lease so she can legally do so, as i can legaly move with no notice. back to crozet. an adjustment but hey the price is right. at least i don't have to stress right now about hoours and rain days. my energy levels are still shot.

  fri - a lesson in insanity - repeating the same thing and expecting diffrent results. i have been hanging out with an ex of mine recently. well, i will just say that we are no longer speaking. i released six weeks of emtions in two words - fuck you. i was tired of being berated and belittled. isaid a few times let it drop. but no of course not. enough of this, on the bright side i won't be distracted from my recovery and delvolping friends/male in recovery. i turn down an invite to go out with the guys on fri night to go watch a movie with said ex. i was so angery that iwas up until four or four thirty friday night that i missed the early meeting sat. and the NA holdiday bowling across the mountian. 
  oh yeah, earlier fri i got my ears done. pierced with 10g. as always the expectation is worse than the piercing. though ears have been the least painful thus far. my first comment was i like the weight. uh oh :)
  sat i slept in late and watched movies. went and heard some increadable flamingo music and dancing at the tea bazzar. i was to tired to make the 11pm meeting.
  sun i went grocery shopping. hungry and stayed within budget. wheeh. i got a good deal on a pot roast. cooked that baby for five and half hours. i fell apart hmmmmm good. went to the meeting at 8 and returned home and gorged myself sick. iti is my favorite meal. anyway enough of this for now. a hear a movie calling me. outlaw justice- willie, kris, waylon, and travis. you know it has to be a good western.

 my meds, lithium,  was really fucking with me. i felt high and confused. my heart was pounding. it wasn't nice. i talked to people in recovery today about it all. i also called my doctor. he was out of town, though he did return his page fromthe free clinic. they called me back and said to quit taking my meds. Thank Goddess 
  a friend and co-worker came and talked with me today. he is also bipolar. the ladies at work told him i was having a ruff time. he told me some more Shitty news. he has cancer. he is going to have to do radation and kemo. he has already had and delt with prostate cancer about five years ago. they now have found it in his testicles. he has been a friend for about ten years. this truely sucks, he didn't handle the prostate cancer well, though beat it. he did have to have kemo. so i will be prayering regularly for the people i love.
  jumping around, the message from the doctor said i should be feeling better in a day or two. i certianly hope so. i guess perspective is important also. i might be feeling like shit and going nuts, but it is not cancer.

"event","last night around 4:30 i awoke afraid. i thought someone/something was in my room. i had my door cracked and had light coming through in a small ray. that ray of light kept flicker like something moving past. i was afraid enough to turn the light on for abit. i almost called someone, i actually had the phone in hand.
  when i went to bed i had trouble falling asleep. my sheets , which are really soft, felt like wool. i was itchy. i would say that i was hypersenative. i finally got to bed around 1:30
  this has happen once before since i gotten clean. i happen before i went on meds. it was worse the time before. i really thought someone was watching me from outside.  and that time it lasted for a good half hour to hour. i was watching the window for a good half hour last time.
  both times felt like psycotic episodes like this summer when i was on crank and been up for four days to a week. i felt like i was high. i was getting patterns of light.
  i could have handled the patterns, iuse to enjoy them, and try to force them. it was the fear that i couldn't handle. i recall sayng this shall pass, but the fear was saying what if it doesn't. i tried to hide under the covers, but my fear was sayng i won't be able to see it coming. so i just turned on the light. and waited until i felt i had some grip.
  this sucks. i'm not sleeping nearly as well as the first week on meds. though i still feel like lead and weak through out the day. still feel like naps all the time. though when i go to bed at night  my insominia is returning. this is a concern. i'm already hypoactive, the sloth, and my meds are compounding it. i feel bloated also. anyway i need to stop playing doctor, i just need to remember and voice my concerns to my doctor at my next appointment."

"event","i woke this morning and saw it raining and called into work. ate a bowl of ceral and crawled back into bed. slept till eleven. got up and went to the noon meeting. had to get to town to make a deposit. 
  i left the noon meeting about half way. it was held hostage. i'm tired of this shit. i wish the chair would speak up and take control of the meeting. i miss the battle axes of recovery. i went to one, battle axe,  tonight who was in town visisting from costa rica. 
 i asked his option about sponsorship. we talked for abit and he made several suggestions. through talking we came up with two possabilties. MR NA said pray on the answer. we walked back into the room and one of the two was in the room mr na and i looked at each other. he said sometimes the answer just presents itself, i nodded and  i said my HP works in signs and omens.
  so i talked to the person, who also happen tobe celebrating two years tonight. he agreed to be my sponsor. i truely hope this one works out. i still haven't heard from sponsor whom i left a message with to call me and that was last friday. i guess i will need to call him and say you are fired, but in nicer terms. i know he is going through some shit.
  i spent the afternoon with a friend in recovery for i was feeling low/down. she feed me and i helped her wash her assistant dog.  journay is such a good dog. obeys over 100 commands. can open doors, turn out light switchs. it is pretty amazing. my friend said that sometimes she has to remind herself that she is smarter than her dog.
  i was feeling down about meds and second guessing my doctor. my friend who was a nurse and also has bi-polar really helped me.
 i'm tired of white knuckling my recovery. going to meetings daily is not enough. i'm a sick puppy, i want to jump right into step work.  know that is the only way. the drugs where a problem, but the true problem is me and this is what i need to change. i know there is no quick answer, no magic wand, but i want to start the process as soon as possable. i have wasted my life thus far and i'm tired of hurting."

"event","well another weekend . it went way to quick. i felt alright through most of it. tired somewhat but that is my new meds. it is still weird for me to think inthe terms of meds. i have always been againest them and now i'm take them for the rest of my life. i guess i need to just keep it in today.
  fri i was tired after the meeting, but got talked into going bowling. i had a good time and it built some friendships. i needed the practice. going bowling next sat. over in the brana region of na. a friend invited me. he bowled 11 straight strikes after a spare on the first frame. i'm going just to see him bowl.
  sat. i went out to my mother and helped her ercect the x-mas tree. she was thrilled i was there even before she had gooten home. she had mentioned about putting the tee up this weekend. so i just showed up and five minutes later she drives in with the tree in the back of her car.
  went to the early meeting sat evening. i walked out of it half way through. people where just ranting and there was no message of recovery to be heard. i felt like i could be spending my time better. so i went to Nicole's and we and got diner and chi tea at the tea house. i had been craving one of their salads. nicole gave me one her paintings. it goes with my theme. i now have four painting by her. granted no large ones, and the one i really want isn't for sale. 
  she happen to be going through some of her boxes and found my software for my digital camera which i thought i had lost. yeah pictures again. my new computer doesn't have it loaded.
  went to the late meeting and it was much better. my home group just adopted this meeting also. i like the name - lost dreams awakeing
sun. i slept in , did dishes. went by nicoles to lend her some movies. had some coffee. then went to area circus(service). as soon as i walked  in myhome groups GSR asked me to take his place. it was no problem.  went back and watched Hellboy with Nicole. hit the eight oclock meeting then grociery shopping.
  the mundane shit huh
  i spoke to my ol;d sponsor about an hour and half total this weekend. if it rains tom or tues. then i think i'm going to go and visist him. i haven't shared in a meeting n about two weeks now. i don't now whats up. either i'm doing ok and havew nothing to share or i feel what i need to share i can't discuss in a meeting. my sponsor has been unavable. i need to find another.  
  i felt like having a cigerette tonight.
  i do feel like my moods have stablized a little. maybe... 
  i need to find someone to i can trust and share with."

  i have been watching way to many movies at home alone. it doesn't help my moods and the feelings of self pitey and loneliness.
  it is way past my bed time. i need sleep.
  talked to my old sponsor for about twenty minutes, old from a few years ago when i was around before, about how i feel like i'm being to picking and switching sponsors. it was good and we are going to talk more tom. but he validated my thoughts to a degree. saying it is ok, it sometimes it five or six until you find the one that works. i wished he hadn't moved out of the area.

i have been sleeping better since i have started taking my meds. i am dreaming more. i use to wake up so often, and not get into deep sleeps. at least the lithuam is helping with that. plus keeping a better sleep pattern. 
 i think the past couple of days i have been feeling better just because of decent sleep, and action, meaning the fact that i have done something/started something to improve my quality of life (hopefully). so sleep and psychosematic. don't know.
 i wish today had gone well. on the upside- I AM CLEAN TODAY!

"event","well it has been a couple of days. tues was 30 days clean for me.  long fucking month. but i feel good. my depression has been flairing up though. the weather hasn't helped. thus far only eight hours at work this week. hopefully i can work sat. it looks like it will be nice.
  monday i went to the hostiptal to get blood work done. i have been putting that of for a couple of weeks. had to sit for an hour while a cadre of pregnet women got their blood work done. it was was first come first served, but just listening to the all. the worst was the ones who had already had kids. aaarggg ;)
  tuesday my thirty days i went and got the phases of the moon done across my shoulder blades. they look great. i'm pleased. 13 of them crestent to full to crestent again. 
  nicole is supposedly working on a tortiose for me to go under my kangi letters at the base of my spine.
  i think my new sponsor is going to work out. a hard ass. he told that if he hears ""i know"" three times he is going to hang up the phone. don't take it personally it just that the term ""i know"" is an attidtude that leaves no room to learn. 
  going to my brothers tom. i'm going to keep the day short. family is ruff. trying not to think about it much.  need to be back anyway for i agreed to open and set up the meeting for my old home group from the last time around. it gives a legitamte excuss to leave. plus i know how much <i>fun<i> i have on holidays. i was dreading the fact that i might have to chair. i dope fiend someone tonight into agreeing to chair whee. i just hope she shows up. if not i guess i will have to step up. baby steps. i just really dislike being the focus of attention.
  i hope that the test results will be back to the free clinic on monday for that is my next appointment.
  it feels good to have picked up my 30 days tag. it wasn't easy. it was a long fucking month. i think i said this already.
  i am thinking about moving back to my mothers. a basement apartment doesn't help my depression, plus going into winter not knowing my hours will be. i feel guilty even thinking about it though even though i have no lease, it is just haven't been long. 
 if i go on medication i would like to be around someone. i moved because it wasn't easy to party while living with my mother. or driving in circles waiting foir her to go to bed. i don't know toying with the idea. 
  being a productive member of society keeps going through my head. thoughts i need to get feedback on.
  i hope to have my first assignment done by this weekend, and to have a sit down with my sponsor.
  i should get off here and get ready for bed, well watch abit of <u>Belladonna's Underground</u>"

 i stopped by nicole's tonight to ask her to draw up a turtle for the base of my spin. it is going to be a sea turtle with spirals within the ""blocks"" on the shell. i'm leaving the rest up to her. i had asked her to have it ready by tuesday but i figured out something while sitting in the 11pm meeting tonight. i'm going to get the phases of the moon across my shoulders arched. i need to fig. out the sizes and number. i would like 13 if i can work it out.  tuesday will be thirty days. so the moon phases will be approite.

  i know i can't trust my thinking. it is still cloaded and will be for awhile.
  i feel down. i bathed and got dressed to go out. but have no where to go. execpt to the meeting. maybe i will just crawl back into bed. i have already had  anap today.
  one person suggested my friends fieance as a possable sponsor. i saw my friend and said that i wanted to talk to her fieance and she offered to give me his cell number, that brought back a memory. i had asked him if he had another number besides the one i had, home number, and he said no just hte home number. so last night i refused to get his cell number and relayed that encounter. i felt like i had asked for his cell number and he didn't give it so why should i get from his fieance, my friend. so my decsion changed after that conversation. i had forgoten that, but i feel slighted.
  both the people i asked know about me and my intersts and that i need a sponsor with an open mind. they both suggested this person whom i don't know well at all. i am considering him.

 i recieved a letter today from my sister Betsy. i have three younger brothers and sister who i don't know. the last time i saw them was about five years ago for a few hours and then maybe two years before then. she is in the tenth grade. her older brother is 18 and her younger brother is 13. wow where the time goes. 
 i spent a couple of hours writing a reply tonight in B&N. no great detail about me. the neatist thing is that she wrote is that she plays the Sax. it is intersting how the sax is all around me. 
  that was the sweet part of the day. the sour was i heard more news concerning my father. he is broke, very literally non funtional. that he is treating my brothers and sister the same as he treated me. that really saddens me. health wise something is going on with his legs. i have seen this with drunks on the street in CA. when i was living on them. i surmise it is to do with the liver. he sold the farmhouse which is the property next to my mothers and that is what he is living on. my ex-stepmother is preparing his town house in annapolisto be sold. 
  i found all this out through my mother which has been in comunacation with my exstepmother. she had to fill out SS form, write the check, put in  a SASE, so my father could apply for SS. all he had to do was sign his name and put in the mailbox.
  it saddens me, i started sobbing in the car on the way home. i'm going to get off here and go back into town for the eleven o'clock meeting. i was going to isolate, but i need recovery, and a friend is also celbrating a year tonight at this meeting."

  i knew using dreams are part of and nothing unusaual in recovery. drug use has been part of my life for 15 years. it not going to go away over night.  
  i woke up in the middle of the night from the dream, thinking of gradatude. glad it wasn't real. glad i didn't enjoy it in the dream, glad i did wake with cravings.
  this morning when i woke i thought about a white key tag and was what recalled the dreram. it was something along the line of me looking for apartments. old glass bottles. i was looking at a place that had a dirt floor. and there was broken glass in the dirt. being told that a floor was going to be built. smoking pot with a ""friend""  then being busted by my mother. the arguement then happened.

"event","oh so hungry wolfing food down as i type- trail mix as the nuked foods is heating. it has been a long day for me. still on the fucking leaf blower, big boss man complaining about the leaves. aaargg blowing leaves with 30 mph wind gusts, so rewarding.
 went and had a talk with my mother. told her i have been off dope for two weeks. i don't think i told her last time around. she was encouraging though i didn't mention NA to her. borrowed a few bucks to by some groceries, my spending still isn't great.
 the mother off my last relationship and coworker offered me an appartment in town. i think it will be ready about the begining of hte year. food is ready hmmm -- hoooot - thinking about it. got a little while. it would put some bills into my name, which will help my credit history.
 thank goddess for sponsors. i had a bad case off the fuck its last night after area service. i was sitting in my car debting to go get high. my addiction was screaming at me. my key tag  was figiting in my hands. finally one sane thought prevailed. i Had to make at least one phone before i could do anything. Thank Goddess my sponsor answered. which is a miricale in itself, he has a very full plate. he meet me at B&N and talked to me for an hour until i was drained enough emtionally to hold off until a meeting an hour away. he had to go because his fieance was in the midst of cooking him dinner. he saved my life , Thanks. I shared that i have trouble calling people so now, not only do i have to call him daily, but i have to call two other people in the program.
  i did so today, called someone who just got a year this weekend, it was an awqard call, i blamed shifted the call onto my sponsor, which i told him i would and he laughed and said fine. and told the person i called what was up about making two phone calls a day.
  while i was at my mother i happen to get a phone call fron c-ville free clinic that an opening became avable this evening for med-shrink appointment. i have been on the waiting list for about two months now. i made the appointment/waiting list before i got clean. i'm glad that i am clean and was clear headed for the appoinment. it lasted for about 2 1/2 hours which i was not exspecting. god my spelling sucks oh well
  i liked the guy. he has been practicing for 35 years. we got along well enough. i have another appointment in three weeks. he is sending me to the hosptial to get some blood work done. basic metabolic panel, CBC, liver profile, thyriod profile 1, and a urinalysis, and i asked him to throw on an HIV test, not really concerned but better safe than sorry. since i'm getting blood work done and for FREE. Thank Goddess for the free clinic. when i hit the lottery they will get a nice donation.
  took a power nap at work today at lunch, stayed up late, wasn't sleepy last night, watched The Ladykillers with Tom Hanks. good movie. 
  still haven't written on my first task given to me by my sponsor. a sentance or paragraph on what i see as the relationship of sponsor/sponsee.
  i think i'm going to go take a bath, for my new ink is itching. i rather soak it off than scratch. light a candle and soak. and think about the first task. the topic tonight was working the steps and commitment. i wish i hadn't missed the first half, but i went straght from the doctors to the meeting.
  be back in bit to write my thoughts...... boots off just a thought, can't wait until friday for my massage appointment, another befit of getting clean, i have my massage therpist back :) really off to the tub for me...... a cinnomin candle
  a bath woke me up. shit and got me thinking about the past. time for a movie Dorm Daze - national lampoons"

"event","my addiction was speaking loadly tonight. i'm sittng in misery right now. i feel the need for a release. i wish i could have a ""take down"" i'm drained and tired. feel the need to just sob though  i can't at this point. 
 i went to area service today even though i have no appointed postion. i use to be GSR for my old home group. 
my mind is going in so many diffrent directions. i wsh to be beaten to the point of where i can cry and have my release. i feel like a pressure pot needing to vent. i'm unable to flog myself to that point. i need to be active in the leather community again. i'm hurting right now. 
   i have already called my sponsor this evening. we talked for about an hour. he help get through my desire to use this evening, though i'm  still hurting. thought about doing some temp. piercings, it is not hte right time. it would not be in  a postive fashion.
  just got home from the 8 oclock meeting, text study, tonight was the first step.
  i'm going to go hide in a movie, my house mates up stairs are home tonight, otherwise i would beat myself. i can't keep the rythm well to push me over the edge. i haven't felt like this in along while. i wish  could talk to someone who understood being a bottom and recovery. i won't burden the one person who might understand.
  it is just one of those nights where i feel the need for pain."

"event","i had the an odd dream last night. that iwas being chased around a lake. and that the sides of the lake where caving in. i woke myself up in the dream. i remember saying to myself wake up this is a bad dream. i woke up and felt like  had been using. the shadows where flipping me out. i kept feeling like i was being watched. i had to turn the lights on several times before i even attempted to get back to sleep. i was awake for about a half an hour. looking out the windows closing my bed room door. 
  any way need to get to get ready for work. very tired. short day for me though i need the hours missed mon and yesterday.
   my spending is going out of control. but then again it has been a couple of years since i have really bought anything for my self. went to wal-mart three times yesterday trying to get a dvd player that will play +r/+rw dvds. you think the boxs would tell you. finally after increasing in price three times twice the price of my orginal selection.

 simple things amuse simple minds
my ink is looks great. i'm so pleased with it.
need to eat way to much coffeee..... in the last hour
my piercing is doing well. no more burn when i clean it :( i know i'm bent

last night at the NA meeting i hit an emtional land mine. backstory - i was assulted when i was attending VCU about 12 years ago. i had my face bashed in with a brick. someone at the meetng who i tryt to advoid sat right behind me. i didn't see him come in otherwise i would have moved. he started sharing and booommm the landmine went off. he always has an angry tone and speaks in violent terms. it set me off. it really unsettled me. a couple of friends noticed that something was wrong and i shared with them after the meetings. i know prinicples over personalities. we are all there for help and support. but at this point fuck it , i don't have the tools. so be it, i  shared what i could with whom i could. not everything is for joe public. is this a reservation? no protecting myself from futher harm.  the other thought that came to me is the reason i advoid this above mentioned person is at some level i reliezed he might be a trigger as last night- fits the profile and just using that term bothers me. i try to be better than that.
  my panic attacks are real and they can be very disablitating for me. i use to ""self medicate"" when they arose or felt like one might be coming on. why wait be pro-active, but not today. my tools are to share and write about it, not stuff it, hide it, nor mask it.

"event","what a scarey day for us all. another four years! enough on that subject
since i'm not going to BR this weekend and i had some extra money. well never really extra, but what i had planned on spending at the leather-mart and not being able to see my piercer for my streching, i decided to get another tattoo and get my nipple streched last night. so they are matching now. yea! i still would like to get vertical barbells behind my hoops down the road.
  my tattoo is a inverted NA symbol a diamond with a circle on the inside with a lotus flower in the center. i got it placed above my triscallion(sp) on my spine. about the center of my back. the artist did a wonderful job. i'm very pleased. i under the gun for about an hour.
  i was talking to my mother yesterday, had to go by the house to get some mail. she had heard some more news concerning my father. i asked that in the future if she would not inform of the news. i have enough hurt/anger/resenments/etc... from or relationship and/or lack there off that i don't need any more in my life. i have had enough at this point. i told i don't have the tools right now in my life to deal with them. i still haven't told her that i'm in recovery. i will at somepoint just not yet. i did though the other night give my brother a call, he just got out of prison, 5 years, for drinking and driving. i did tell him though that i was attending meeetings, because he was complaining that the judge was going to putting all these stipulations on his liences- meetings and breathalizereer in the car. i'm amazed that they are even considering to give him a restricked liences at this point. point being, he was the first person in my family that i have told outright that i was attending meetings.
  i have this pounding head-ache. i spent the day all day with a shop-vac vaccuming leaves off the netting over the coy pond and chicken coop at work. i'm so sick of leaves.
  going to go soak and clean my piercing and ink, then maybe a nap.
  i slept last night with a shirt about four sizes to small just to make sure the hoop didn't flip around to much. i just love that burning of a fresh piercing. i had to do breathing excercies last night in the tub"

  i'm glag my work is understanding and flexable. i just called this morning and said i needed the day off for sanity reasons. it was fine.
  i'm off my pink cload. last night i sobbed for about an hour in someones arms. when i was drained enough i went home. i laid in bed. my covers are in knots. i'm serious about my recovery. i made a deccion last night while crying that next weekend/BR would not be the best place for me and my recovery at this point and time. so i loose 200. i can live with that. while out there that would be one night snorting or a week of smoking. 
  i have to take care of my recovery first. this is what i need to do. I'm wish i had reliiezed this earlyier but i can't concern myself with that. i need to be here and now in today. 
  i thought about going to work for a couple hours this after noon , but i think i will finish my book instead, and do laundry.

"event","what a pretty day. i was in some shock and awe this morning. i was in agreat mood then i talked to my mother. she had been visting my sister for a few days. it had been about a year and a half since het last visist. while she was there my father had called to talk to my sister.
  i haven't spoken to my father in about three years hadn't seen him in about four years. i have called on holidays and randomly to say Hi always a message. i haven't gotten a return phone call. i had decided not to try anymore. it hurts to much. i formed an immedent resentment towards him, another one i guess. he calling my sister and they not blood related and i don't even hear from him, though honestly i really don't want to speak to him now. my mother said that my sister said it sounded like stuart had cotton in his mouth. drunk. i hear he isn't doing to good from my aunt and the rumor mill. it really took the air out of my sails today. i think i will tell my mother that in the future i don't even want to hear about him. it really has been bothering me. i shared about it today at the noon meeting.
  i think i need to get off here and go back to town. i don't need to be alone right now. i'm getting emtional and i'm not ready to habdle that alone."

  went to work today. blowing leaves and helping close the pool up for the year. while i was going down the drive i had my first using thought since monday sneak in. i was taking a break and rubbing my shoudlers and neck and thought about smoking pot. i made a couple calls, left messages. then shared about it at the meeting tonight and then later with my sponsor at the hallowween party. i think my sponsor and i will work out. i didn't want to wait to long or put it off to long.
  i knew him before hand though we weren't that close.

"event","i haven't been sleeping well this week at all. tossing an turning. dreaming a lot and waking up constantly. last night was my first lucid dream in about 2 1/2 years.
 it is gettng fainter as we speak. i was somewhere near my mothers house walking and came upon a house. i didn't know them thou they knew the family. they collected old bottles and similar interests to me. somehow or another i found my self in their back yard after being in the house and talking though i can't recall any of that right now. i remember a tree and i squated down behind it and was digging with my hands into the dirt up under the roots/trunk of the tree and found a bucket of old marbles. i don't really recall much more.
  i went to work and discribed as much of the dream to the sisters whom are my boss, not to be confused with the owner of the prop. one sister is a trained herbalist as well as a gardener and the other is a dream ""worker"" as well as agardener. so they asked what marbles meant to me. i said pretty and valuable. i collect them. i never really played marbles as a kid. they suggested i keep a dream journal and i should always create a title for them. off the top of my head i said finding lost marbles. i brought a chukle. though i see it as the beginnig of the truth. sanity is slowly returning in my life, and so are friends as the ex-wife of my old sponser said.
  i'm need to sleep soon but i wanted to write and to do so i had try and figure out what was up with my puter and online problem.
  i'm have madfe it through another day clean, the fifth.
  one sister, the herbalist has made me some liver tonic tea to help me detox my system and boost my liver. i was honest with them about what was going on. told all my co-workers, not sure if big boss man knows, but prob.
  the ingreidants that i know in the tea thus far is burdock root, dandelion root, ginger, cinnomon, carddimon and i don't know what else. though i do know there is nothing in it that mess with me. ie valerian root, passion flower.
  i have made the commitment to myself to do 60 meetings in 60 days. i have a sponser now. i asked someone i knew the last time i was around to be my sponser. he has five years. we weren't that close last time though friendly. he said he would be honored. he also knows about my kink side.
  that brings up BR for me. i'm going to have a meeting list and try to attend while i'm there. my old sponser's ex wife will be in manases for that time and i have her phone number and hotel address, and tonight someone from the past was visting from out of town from baltimore. he moved up there about six months ago i gather. so i got his number also in case i need to talk and/or quick get away.

  last week i hit my emtional bottom. it scared the hell out of me. i hit my drug bottom this summer. i had to pull myself up out of that shit before i could even reliaze/feel an emtional bottom.
  last saterday i was having bad thoughts of hurting myself, so i went to rent movies. as i was leaving someone called my name. it was an old friend/using buddy from crozet. 25 miles away. we talked for a few and he said he was in recovery. one of the last people i would have thought. i said i had been thinking recently about it and i may see him soon.
  i saw2 him monday night at my first meeting. i told him i took it as an omen seeing him on sat.
  i have been watched over by the goddess. bless her
  i'm jumping around. tired not sleepy yeah sleepy
 talked to my old sponser tonight also. he was calling me every month for at least the first year i was back out. changing numbers up on me so i couldn't screen them. he has moved over to the valley but i wanted at least say hi. i get up with him sometime soon and play some bridge. it seems the whole sat. bridge group has moved to the valley.
  the other night after leaving the meeting and driving to get some food and coffee igot choked up. i think it was the third night/ wend. yeah yawn yawn sleep.  i was overwhelm by the love and happiness old friends showed and shared with me. and on the postive note i bid you goodnight.
  oh another postive note. bought a tire for my car today. no more odoughnut. it has been three weeks on my spare. paid my loan off thou i will need to take another one next thursday. paid my rent
 yawn goodnight really this time."

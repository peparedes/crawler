[DWIGHT SPITS]
I strive to be humble lest I stumble
Never sold a jumbo or copped chicken with it's mumbo sauce
Tyson is a Fowl holocaust
Fill and gas your whole head up with poetry I'm fed up
Ignore cordon bluh
Stand up get up
Lunge for your knife
Don't forget your potholders

[MF DOOM]
What
These old things
About to throw them away
With the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like O.J
Usually I take them off with oil of ole
MC's is crabs in a barrel pass the old bay
Hot as hell and it's a cold day in it
Working on a way that we roll away tinted
Some say the price of holdin heat is often too high
You either be in a coffin or you be the new guy
The one that's too fly to eat shoe pie
[never too busy]
Never too busy when it comes down to you and I
[Swear to god]
A lot of niggaz wish to die
Need to hold they horses
There's bigger fish to fry
Your on the list
If not hit the number spot
Ten and a half Timbs is made to kick your bumbaclot
Could have had a V-8
F-150 quad cab but I'll be straight
Money comes and goes like that two bit hussy that night that tried to rush me
Dwight pass da dutchie
So I can calm down so they don't get it twisted
Take it from the fire side it wont get blistered
Got it
What happened oh it's not lit
These metal fingers be holding hot shit

[DWIGHT SPITS]
When I was four I pen god was born in new york
Back in seventy seven still got nan in the crescent
The effervescent of gods presence is thick
Unlike vapor
Escarole
extra roll
Word to the baker
Peace to the hard working ginger bread makers
Looked her up and down said hmmmm too much make up
Poor music taste
Ten years from being grown up
Rappers don't blow up heads do
[awwwww shit]
My name is Dwight Spits
I'ma sonic addict
I use to think it was merely a dangling habit
Born under a bad sign
I'm serious about this curse of mine
I strive to flip it in the fine wine
Barely born a virgin is what the stars said
Black not white red all over doe like elmo
Twenty eight years have passed I feel I'm peaking
I make music every weekend
It's a chore
A fact of life
A labor of love
I get mad love but I can test the labor
And it's wages
You know death
I serving life from this gift of god
Don't forget your potholders my niggaz"

"event","so yeah basically a scare of the wantuzah was very frightening. so heres the story and how it goes from the top :|


so i was basically looking for a date for the marine corps ball and i go up to my friends workspace and i basically just casually ask him like hey man you gotta date for the ball? and he's like yeah man and i ask joe one of his workers and, he's like yeah and i'm like damnit... am i the only guy w/o a date? and he's like dude ask her? (next to him is one of his marines his workers) and i'm like nah dude i don't even know who she is.... and he's like dude just ask her and i'm like for what!? its cool... so like then everyone that is up there is telling me like all this shit like i should ask her and i was like it's cool man (i kinda didn't want to because i didn't know her but they seemed to have a history and i didn't want to get involved in any way :|) so anyways we started talking and i took her out to lunch and we kinda went out and did stuff as friends the day of the ball comes and yeah like we get all prepped up and we go up to the hotel room and everyone starts getting drunk so yeah the whole night we're talking and dancing and she's cute i'll put a picture <a href=""http://photobucket.com/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y186/trismatics/trismatics-1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a> theres me and will... anyways back to the point yeah and i'm trying not to do anything cause i just thought about Ligia. well yeah we go up to the room near the end of the night and we change and she started kissing me and i was like okay... and yeah just throughout the whole night we're making out all over the place. till we end up back in the room and thats where the magic happens anyways before anything happens though i had asked her hey i don't want you to be to drunk to regret anything and she's like i'm not that drunk and i was like okay. another note before anything happened i had asked my friend and my date if anything ever happened between them and he's like nah man we're just friends. anyways next morning we wake up and i go back and yeah then i head down to calexico and i was talking

girl: i think tatoos are so awesome i'm gonna get one when i get back plus they look really hot on guys.

me: tatoos are like chipped teeth you look stupid with'em just that people are too nice to say anything same with piercings other than ears.

girl: your just hatin cause you don't look good with them.

me: nobody does.

girl: god rudy your so retarded.

me: tatoos are.

girl: whats wrong with getting one.

me: the fact that when your old and pruny that shits gonna look like gangreen on your skin all warn out you'll probably have a stroke and forget what it means people judge you instantaneously i don't make'em but either way you have a higher chance of catching hepatitis than from sharing needles. listen you get a tatoo if you want i really don't care look stupid if you want to. 

girl: (all bothered) like yeah whatever

me: (thinking i don't think she'll be getting a tattoo anymore)

later...

girl: i think i'm gonna get a tribal

me: i was like yeah just like other people huh?

girl: whatever

me: you know i once tattoos and piercings made you look differnt they don't it just makes you look like everyone else, the way i see it nowadays is that your mind and thoughts make you different from everybody else.

girl: yeah but you express yourself through your tatoos.

me: and wtf!? is a tattoo gonna do what if you get a tribal tattoo and then a buttload of lesbians get tattoos and then tribal tattoo's are a symbol of lesbians. tattoos are wiggidy wack, me i express myself through acting like a dumbass i like to make people laugh shit you can't see that through my tattoo's you can meet me and see who i really am vice looking at some fucking ink, if you went to my house and saw a motorcycle you'd think damn this foo rides that shit. what if it isn't mine exactly point proven.

girl: whatever i'm still getting one.

me: cool then i'm getting a gun :)

and thats how i came about buying a weapon :) i think i'm gonna get a revolver :) or saturday night special :) ahh yeah. or a 9MM with a burst action haha.

"event","i hate fucking chuck norris jokes. i hate reggayton. i hate idiotic drunk people. i hate when people think they're like funny and they're not like they'll say shit just to say (i do it a lot but i hate myself). people who rock out long ass shirts :|. people that wear jeans like way too tight *guys* that it gives them a cameltoe :|. guys that swear they do shit cooler than everyone :| or if you do something they'll always have a story. GILMORE GIRLS and ONE TREE HILL! all WB shows cept Smallville (wierd) guys that repeatedly say the same line from the same goddamn movie or chappelle show :|. guys that swear they're more punk rock than god himself. people that swear like they got it all bad. pity party personnel. crappy music people. andgelina jolie and BRAD PITT they need to be thrown in a fuckin volcano but then rescued so their body has second degree burns not third second so they can feel seering pain. i hate bi chicks they're like really annoying look you can't like both things :|. white folks that dance. real world casts except 7 :) ahh that ruthie stole my heart :(. warcraft. halo storyline even though i never played campaign and i only play multiplayer i still think it sucks :|. guys that wear cowboy hats IN CALIFORNIA that shit needs to stay in texas unless your mexican i can understand that gramps :) that homie rocks :) honestly i'd love to introduce him to ya'll free sodas or beer :). songs that have a cheap ass beat (i.e. laffy taffy, erbody get tipsy, lean wiff it pop wiff it.) i like some complication in my beats boadies. people who tell you to shut the fuck up cause they're pissed off for no reason.

"event","so guess guess what i have 2 years in this thing i'm in a little thing called the marine corps... so anyways i was just thinking about today... about all the things i've done since i've been like i got two years left and whatnot but what i've done for two years is like wow i don't get the luxury of saying i hung out with friends but then again there are some memories i could've never had if i weren't in the marines like think about it so many concerts i would've never attended things i would've never seen... i would've never really met my family and i would've never made a bunch of friends been places i'd never thought i'd go. i've made some friends lost friends but you know what i think its for the best i've lost family member's missed family events but i know they think about me. whether it was the worst decision of my life or the best i don't know. people decided it at first that it'd suck cause i was going to iraq you know what people iraq sucks its boring sometimes i wish i was experiencing the shit on tv :|... i'm not i'm in an office doing crap looking at websites and whatnot writing constant emails :|... there isn't much that goes on. lemme see days of freedom i've missed :|... from may 2004 to november 2004 it was lost i wish i could've seen those times i saw some hard times i've seen some hard things there is still so much that i have to do when i am done i don't think i can say i regret it i'm not around a lot people i've gotten a lot more antisocial but thats cool i don't think i need more people in my life. they say i've changed i still think i'm the same person you could say i'm an asshole but i just think maybe your a bitch i'm not a mean person i think i'm nice i come off rough but deep down inside i'm a cuddly type teddy bear haha :) but seriously there are times where i wish i could be there for my family or friends but i can't cause i'm out here doing this marine thing what happens next i don't know but lets see where it takes me and i can only wait for the times whether bad or good it doesn't bother me i'm just about ready for anything. relationships i don't think i can manage one i've been single for what lemme see 3 years now i've been well off theres a couple of one night flings thrown in there but thats not really me if it happens it happens i've done a lot of bad things but i can't really say its something to be proud of. its wierd that never in my life did i think i'd partake in a war although the war over here i'm fighting is against deadlines and updates but just cause i say that doesn't mean there isn't braver men and women fighting a frontline. ..

on a much less thoughtful note i had steak and lobster.

"event","[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times (hard, times)
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times (hard, times)
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times (hard, times)
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times
I'm tryin to make it through these hard times (hard, times)
Hard times (hard), hard times (hard)

[Verse One: Ludacris]
You never know how much you miss a person, until they gone
Like to hear it? Hear it go, I'm rehearsing, gotta sing my song
I know I've done some wrong, but I can't get right
Cause life is like a big fight
I'm stickin-and-movin, tryin to get my shit right
My family's been houndin me, friends they done turned against me
Kinda like they hearts was on a full tank, but now they empty
And they say I've changed, but like twins I'm just the same
It's because of my job, mo' money mo' prob in this dirty game
This industry FUCKED UP
That's right I said it, and it's fake as ever
Keep real niggaz around me, stay ""Space Age 4 Eva""
Po-ppa never went and jumped the broom, never got that one degree
But if you looked down from heaven, you'd still be proud of me
Your son was DUI, but my momma made it by
I didn't shed no tears when you left me
but the rest of the family cried
Trials and tribulations, ruined my concentration
Losin my patience, hard times for goodness sake'n

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Eightball]
As this Valium slowly starts to kick in
Them subconcious, subliminal thoughts, start tickin
This whole world around me, diseased, and crumblin
Babies doin dope cause daddy did it right in front of them
Everybody wanna blame music for they bad kids
Sittin up in the court talkin 'bout Eminem made me do what I did
My own hard times rolled in like the fog
Try to think of others, but I can't get past my own thoughts
My momma, in 1967, pickin cotton
While other blacks was gettin liberated, boycottin
My old man was a player, ain't no hidin that
He started tootin then he graduated to smokin crack
I never saw him, never needed to see that muh'fucker
He left me and my mother stuck down here in this fuckin gutter
I tattoed it on my arm so I can't forget it
It's in my mind and my heart so I'm forever with it

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: MJG]
A drum machine, the old fo'-track, and a pack of new tapes
In the middle of, 1988, in a corner cafe
We made beats, and hung with old heads, and stayed out late at night
Do talent shows, fo'-way split the dough, that was our way of life
My momma stayed, home full time so she could raise me
Knowin without a, household father, things could get crazy
Sometimes I listened, sometimes I thought I knew it all
But nevertheless, momma was with me through it all
I graduated out of nothin, not out of school, it was like
12, 13, 14 years I'm thinkin cool
I might as well, be focusin on me tryin to get paid
Usin these rhymes I've been writin since in the 7th grade
Our team played, and had physical sex with minimum wage
It was just like a piece of pussy
It fucked me long as I stayed
But still I prayed, Lord I'm tryin now please help me out the water
It can't get no harder
Help me to get back up and get my shit tomorrow

[Chorus - 2X]"

"event","Well its official, we have agreed on a pirce for the house, and our closing day should be may 30 woohoo. See all that worrying for nothing right? But its still not over yet, now comes the fun part of home inspections. 

So today went a little better, I had my ipod with me today at work so I had fun. Got home Still no damn yankees cd which should be in sometime this week. Got to go see emily. and sometime during the middle of all that I got the call saying they accepted the second offer we gave them. Mom thinks me and em are mad at her, cause weve been avoiding her lately. Which were not, were just trying to stay away from all the stressful situations we can right now. Ive been working on my ipod every chance I get. I am about halfway through, I still need to delete a couple of songs a make a work playlist. Been wanting to play wow lately although I have no time for it except for the 2 hours at night I have free. Growing up I am seeng is a balance of good things and bad things. I'm just happy that things are starting to show now, like wedding plans, a house. I forgot to mention me and em are currently doing pre marital counceling every sunday night. 2 more sundays of that to go. Were supose to go sign the papers on the final agreed price tomorrow. We might grab some subway and head to the park after that, maybe throw some baseball. Just kinda relax alittle. 

I am also finding out that I Don't know crap when it comes to music. For instance, I did not know that foreigner did double vision, and hot blooded. Also I didnt know Joe Walsh (Rocky mountain way) was in the eagles. My brothe ron the other hand has a plethora of knowledge. Which is another reason I love working with him cause its like Im going to school also. Plus I get to rip his cd's to my ipod :) btw if you have never heard/heard of tamplin, Go download tamplin-Dancing on a volcano, there an 80's christian band. Also checkout Magdalen which is ken tamplin's band before he went solo.

Can you take me high enough?

Been a long time I know but tonight I got in from signing a ""contract"" offering a bid on a house. Starting to get a little stressed so I figured why not go to the ole live journal.

First off that is not a current picture just thought it was appropriate :). Life is has been good as of late. It has its ups and downs, as always but for the most part its great. Atually if it werent for 3 things my life would suck. 1. God of course 2. Emily 3.The fact that im about to get married and move away from home. A few things have happened since I last updated. My brother moved back home from Florida, and is working with us now (me and dad). That has been really cool cause we are just alike, and its great having my big bro around again. Mom and Dad are basically losing it. Mom is under stress because of finances, her new job, her mom living with us, me moving out and getting married, and dad being pissed. Dad is stressed Because his dad got put in a nursing home, finances, my mom, and my grandmother. So there doing what they normally do, going to oposite bedrooms and letting it ride. Me being the peacemaker as always has added stress because of not only those things, but buying a house, getting married, managing a full time fiance/soon to be wife, pressure from my grandmother to move out, and work which isnt bad just having to work with your father everyday gets to become a chore in itself.

A survey once asked what were the 3 most stressfull things in life, number 1 was buying a house, (check) number 2 was Getting married (check), and number 3 was losing a loved one (almost a check my grandfather isnt supose to make it). I dont need added crap from my hostile family. I am feeling like I have to make up for my 2 brothers who all but disown my parents for doing the same damn thing there putting me through. I dont mean to make it sound like im an saint that never does anything wrong. I am human after all. Hopfully next time wont be so whiny. 

For those of you about to rock I salute you!

"event","Tonight I am feeling a little wierd, talking with aaron and drew. Seeing how there relationships are going, I look at mine. SOmetimes I can't help but wonder if something like that will ever happen. As it is now me and emily have our fights, but by the end of the night were just as in love as we ever were. Tonight we had a couple of fights, I don't even know what I did. I know thats what most guys say, but youd have to know me. I am not like other guys when it comes to stuff like this, I care deeply for em's feelings, I love her more then any other person could love someone. Honestly I would gladly die for her, she means that much to me. And still after having all those feelings and loving someone so much we still end up fighting. 

I hate it when she cries, especially in a fight that weve had. Even though I know its her hormones, or whatever still it kills me to see her cry/hurt, one ounce. I know that throughout our lives were gonna have arguements, and I accept that. just tonight its hit me harder, then ever, and its not really anything I did. I don't what to go into anything specifically that happene tonight, cause I don't want anyone taking sides. She even realizes that its her fault when we argue and she will apologize, but do that same thing 5 minutes later. I don't know, I truly do love her with all my heart, every second of every day. I want to be married to her, I know we were meant to be. Tonight after I left em's house everything was fine, I get home and call her. well the cell phone starts acting up and she thinks I'm mad at her. She calls back after being disconnected and we have another arguement. (later I found out her dad had yelled at her) But still why does she want to get mad at me for her dad. And also no matter what anyone says words DO hurt especially from someone you love, little piece of advice, don't ever call your significant other names. It hurts them alot more then they will ever tell you. I'm the one who is there always for her, the one who loves her more then anyone on this earth. My mom always says that ""actions speak louder then words"" I can honestly say that I do show emily every day how much I care about her, and she will admit it too. I'm not saying im mr perfect either, cause I do have my faults also. After all I am human. 

On a lighter note, there are fleas or gnats in my house because the crypt keeper hasn't taken a bath in 3 days. Shes driving me nuts also, gosh I love her to death but, old people are hard headed and set in there ways. So many things are going on in my life right now, I'm getting married in Spetember, WoW comes out tuesday, and I got a raise a couple weeks ago. Yet somedays (like today for me) You get a hard kick of reality. I look ahead and realize That I need to save so much money, but look and see I need to spend so much money. Not only for christmas, but just everyday crap. Like yesterday, I spent 30 bucks on an oil change, then another 30 taking my mom and the crypt keeper out to lunch (what a good boy I am) 60 bucks down the drain in less then an hour. and I'm still looking for a place to live. I'm planning on moving out in june or july, looking for an apartment I think. I like the idea of having an aprtment, vs a house. just the type of living space and suroundings. I mean yes financially its wiser to buy a house. I don't know I'm still praying about it. Praying.....I think drew said it best when he said ""I know I long for my innocence"" It's like after I turned 21 life just hot me hard. Everything that I had been taught and told about, I'm finding myself having a different opinion on them. Instead of just blindly following, I'm finding out for myself. Theres been alot of things in my life that have been total life changers. Reading drews entry made me think of rod and shelly, the youth group, and then my own life. I never went to rod and shellys funeral, I just couldn't do it. for me my closure was just being reminded of all the times we spent together. Everything was so much simpler back then. I think me and all of my friends are growing up. Drew, aaron, eli, eric, and josh. 21 is just a point I think in most everyones lives where you stop and realize, your not a kid anymore. Anyway I'm gonna head to bed, gratz drew on becoming president of akl.

"event","Well its been awhile since if updated, since haloween its been extremly busy, I've just completly forgotten about updating. SO I'm not gonna go over all that went on cause most of it is normal every day stuff. but I will hit all the important stuff.

Mom had her knee surgery, it went well. She doing alot better now. The crypt keeper finally left (Thank God) She was staying here helping mom out while she was bed ridden. Mom is ready to get out of the house, I know how she feels, when I had my surgery I was in the house for 3 weeks. I was ready to just go and drive around the block. Haloween went great me and em stayed at her house and watched chucky movies both nights and handed out candy. I have pictures to post I just need to put em on the computer. Me and aaron went to guitar prctice thursday at 7:00 and stayed till close to 10, jamming with jeff. It was awesome. Jeff got a neww Boss Js-5 Jamstation, so we were all taking turns soloing over some blues presets. Emily hates jeff now :) I am really amazed at how me and aaron have progressed in our guitar playing ability in the few months working with jeff. Its like a baby learning how to talk, and jeff is the one showing us how. Before me and aaron were decent as far as solos go, we would hit all wrong notes and play in the wrong key. Now me and aaron can see where we are and look ahead and know where we want to go. $75 bucks a month is well worth it. 

Everyday my love for emily grows more and more. It may sound like sappy love crap, but its true when they say ""when you find the right one you'll just know"" Me and emily have grown even closer over the past few weeks. And thats exactly how I want it to always be, never be at a lull but to constantly fall in love with each other all over again every day. Every night I thank God that he has sent me her, because everynight that i see her, I fall more in love with her. September seems so far away, and yet its not as far away as it was. Time seems like its flying yet, it can't go fast enough. I can't wait to marry her and make her my wife. Tomorrow is our 8 month anniversary. There is so much im thinking right now, so much I want to say but when I try to form it into words, I just comes out as one big blah. 

I'm at home from work waiting to eat lunch with mom, then me and dad are gonna head back out. tonight em is gonna come over and eat dinner with us. Micah is hopefully coming over this weekend, Im gonna show him ""Drewbot"" cause hes thinking about getting one. I'm still drooling over the boss Js-5 hehe. Oh I bought GTA San Andreas, extremly good game, and adds alot more then vice city. World of warcraft comes out November 23. Well my time is running out so im gonna finish the post, hopefully it won't be so long before I post again.

"event","Well today was my last sunday to play for Destiny life church. Funny how pastor scott and his wife totally ignored me all day. (shrug) I honestly have no hard feelings, I have been unhappy for some time now, and thursday night was just the final push. I wish there church well and hope they grow and prosper. As for me its back to clearbranch with emily. They have cool t-shirts anyway :P. My brother is moving back to birmingham. When I first heard this (before anything started happening at destiny) The first thought in my mind was to playguitar at my brothers church. Something I have wanted for a long time. I'm torn though, I feel like em and her parents want me to get plugged in at clearbranch. I mean that IS emily's home church, and when we get married I would be taking her away from that. But as of right now I don't feel called to play at clearbranch. My brother moves back the first week in november, I'll talk to him sometime about it, depending on that conversation I will make a final decision. I do feel like I made the right decision thus far though.

Me and em went to clearbranch's church picnic today, it was pretty fun. Good food, watched the youth play football. I kinda wanted to join in, had I knew anybody or been a part of the church then I probably would have. Me and em stayed close together most of the day, I got to meet some of the people I have been hearing about. They had some of the choir there gather around and sing a few songs while one of the guitarist played. It was fun and good music. I'm still tired from this weekend, I don't think I have stopped since thursday. Thursday I went to work got home went to practice, then went to emily's, then home. Friday I went to work then to practice, stayed for church, went to emily's got a call saying my cousin is in the hospital I need to go pick up my other cousin who is atthe house by herself, me and em go pick her up go back to my house and they both spend the night. Saturday me and em got up staye home and rested for a little bit, even though I didnt get much sleep since I was on the couch, went and did a errand for mom went to the thriftstore, stoped by aaron's, went home, went out to eat with ems parents, went to her house and watched ""child's play"" then I cam home. Woke up a hour late today, rushed to springville, played, went to emily's, fought with her, went to the picnic, came back to her house, got tacobell, left her house about 8:30 got home, took a shower, talked with mom and am now about to go to bed.

I'm getting sick of people getting pissed at me, mom is starting to get pissed, cause were not here to spend time with her just cause she is cooped up in the house. I went from being home every night and taking her out to a movie and lunch on the weekends, to doing nothing with her going out everynight and being with emily. Thats how life is! I have found my wife, but she is trying to make me feel guilty. Dang I can't wait till september 24. I know life has its troubles, ups and downs, and all that crap. But I still have to vent out frustration sometimes. hopefully after this weekend things will slow down for a little bit. OH also on top of everything I am having sinus problems, which include migrains. I think some of it is stress. owell I'm about to go to bed. gnight all.

"event","Man I haven't updated in awhile, gotten side tracked think im gonna just talk tonight in stead of summarizing the whole last 3 days. im tired. I just got in from emily's before thta band practice, my life seems like its going by pretty fast. I have so many oportunities and doors I can walk through, yet I don't know which one. My dad and I don't get along at work. which who really gets along with there family if there working for them anyway. My mom and I got into it today cause she is taking up for my dad just because ""he doesn't feel good"" she thinks something is wrong with him. I know exactly whats wrong with him, hes an old fart. Don't get me wrong I love my dad, but sometimes I wished I could video tape him for one day, then let him watch it and show him how he comes across. The only thing going for me right now is my relationship with emily. This stuff with aaron has kinda got me freakin out sometimes cause I think crap. what if emily goes psycho on me one day, and dumps me. I would be crushed, but then I remember that I know emily better then that, that I love her dearly and she loves me every bit as much as I love her. Found out today that my pastor has been making fun of me behind my back. I had a syst in my belly button, nothing major but it was a bubble, the doctor popped it and everything was fine. told my pastor about it, I find out im a joke around the church, I am now refered to as ""bubbleboy"". I hope Im not talking in circles I just am venting right now, trying to work through these emotions. Sometimes I wished I could just speed up time to after me and em get married. I won't have to answer to anyone but em and God. Right now I just want to crawl in my bed and not wake up untill september. tomorrow night im supose to play at church saturday im supose to work with dad, and sunday morning im supose to play at church. ""No rest for the wicked"" I'm just depressed right now. I wished emily was here, not saying anything just laying on my bed with me falling asleep with me. Sometimes I feel like people take advantage of me, cause I will admit I am a nice guy. I will do things for people out of the goodness of my heart and they take advantage of me. I'm not tooting my own horn but thats the way I have always been. Don't get me wrong I have some great friends, Aaaron, Drew and Micah, have always been there for me, i'm not leaving anyone out those are just the three that I have known the longest and gotten the closest too. They have never taken advantage of me, and have always been there for me. But still even now were not as close as we were, Drew is off at college, micah lives further away then he use too. As far as aaron goes hes here, we play guitar together kinda have a unspoken oath to always remain friends and bandmates. (sigh) Think this is the wierdest entry I have ever written, sorry if I rambled and if I hurt anyones feelings, wasn't ententional I'm just depressed right now, tired physically, emotionally, and mentally owell Thank God for emily.

"event","This weekend has been fun, been hanging out with em. Her parents went out of town, so I have kinda been the man around there house. Took Em and ally (Alf) her sister some breakfast this morning, and went shoping with em today. Man am I whiped.....but its a good thing :)

Woke up today around 8 and called em, like she told me too the night before. I woke her up and she was talking in that growling you just woke me voice. Heres kinda how it went.

Rusty- (Picks up the phone and dials em)
Em- (Mumbles)
Rusty- Hey baby did I just wake you up?
Em- (mumbles)
Rusty- you want me to let you go back to bed?
Em- (mumbles I don't know)
Rusty ok well I'll let you go ok?
Em- (Mumbles) and hangs up

Hehe, She called me back 5 minutes later cause she couldn't go back to sleep. So we decided I would pick them up Mickey D's for breakfast, and then we would go shopping at the mall. So I went to ems house, we went to the mall, and then came back to her house. Em and me then went to go rent a movie and get some dinner since alf was going out on a date. Me and em went back to her house and ate gutheries while we watched the ""johnsons family vacation"" which was pretty funny. Sometime during the movie we got up and baked chocolate chip cookies. man I'm stuffed. SO afer the movie we watched tv. (meaning I watched tv while em slept) Alf and her date got home about 10:00 and came in and chatted with me and em for a little bit. After he left alf went to her room and me and em stayed in the living room and watched the dog show on animal planet. I left soon afterwards. Oh I also bought the rolling stones greatest hits cd today and pink floyed dark side of the moon. 

So I'm starting to slack on my entries guess everyone does it, first its a every day thing then it becomes a every 2 days summary. Soon I'll be posting just to let everyone know i'm still alive and thats it. Nah Its really just been eventful, so I have been too tired to post. Tomorrow should be cool, em's parents are coming back in town, me and em will be spending most of the day together. She needs to study for some test/quiz on monday so I will probably help her with that. Owell thats my life up to now, hope you enjoyed it, Go Auburn!, and good night.

(This thing got a 8 track in it?) (8 track, 9 track, 10 track, its got all of em its a cd player.)

I woke up yesterday morning, went to work as usual, came home and met aaron at 4:15 for guitar, we went to jeffs. and jeff didnt show me comfortably numb yet. :( but we did work on some more licks on Crossroads. He showed aaron Santana- Black magic woman, and some pretty cool licks to go over that, sounded good and I got 2 lessons :) as did aaron. after that I went and picked emily up and we got lemon pepper wings from exotic wings and things muhahaha. They were great. after thath we went back to her house and watched the movie Envy with jack black and ben stiller, I can't give an accurate review because emily didnt like it so the whole movie she is distracting me. from what I saw its one of those comedies where you kinda have to follow it. I left shortly after the movie went off. came home and started checking email, and post from friends lie normal and after waiting 5 minutes for a webpage to load I decided to go to bed. I was really tired last night anyway. 

Today wasnt that bad of a day we did a job at Steign mart. We put them a pole in the middle of the store that had two plugs on it, and wired it up. Pretty cool something I have never done. So I got home, about 3 hours ago. and have taken a shower read post from last night talked to emily, and played around on the guitar. Aaron is suppose to come over later, So I figured before something came up I would go ahead and take care of it all in one post. Emily is keeping kids at her church tonight, which is a normal thing on thursday nights for her. I miss her. I'm currently waiting on ups there supose to bring me my other sustain pedal and midi cable tonight. mom has to have surgery sometime next week she has to rips on the inside of her knee, I hope it helps her. So anyway im running out of things to type. I'm gonna stop the entry now.

So last night I was craving some lemon pepper wings from ""exotic wings n things"", but instead had to settle for homemade tacos, which were really good.

Yesterday I came home after work and called emily, met her at her house, so we could ride together to pay her moms water bill fo rher, then we went to the dollar store. We were close to Books-a-million which reminded me that there is a book that is supose to be coming out in october that I have to get. It's the 3rd book in the series and the second book left me hanging. So anyway we head there and its not in yet, owell so we go and look in old navy and head on back to emily's house. Justin calls me on our way home asking if I'm gonna make it to church band practice tonight, I really hate going on tuesday nights, because it waste the whole night. I meet him at 6:00 ride up to springville, practice for a couple hours and leave to come back to trussville, I don't get home till 10:00. So I tell him im not gonna make it tonight, and if we can start meeting in the afternoon so me and him can go over the guitar parts for the music on sundays, that way it only takes like an hour and I would always be able to come. At first hes like yeah that sounds great man, and we hang up. He calls me like 15 minutes later, and tells me that he talked to his wife tabitha, and Paster scott, and he feels like if me and him started doing that, that it wouldn't be fair to the other band members. (starts getting pissed) Said we really needed a set practice day that me and all the other members could get together and go over the songs. (even more pissed off) I said well Justin I can tell you right now im not gonna be there for every practice if your gonna keep it on tuesday nights, because I really don't have time on tuesday's to do that, so I will try my best but can't promise anything he said thats fine. So he would rather me not come to practice then at least go over the material for sunday morning. I'm not asking for awhole lot here, as a matter of fact I'm doing this to help him out. Hes taken something I have enjoyed doing, and turned it into a chore. grrr I could complain more, but I don't feel like it.so anyway we get back to emily's house, eat and work on the puzzle some more, after staying there till about 9:30 I head home. 

My computer won't start and I didn't feel like typing on the other computer cause the keyboard is broken halfway, so I went on to bed. I'm about to head to jeff's for guitar, I'll tell ya all about it, tonight I hope. untill then.

I woke up today feeling like, well I didn't want to go to work but I could care less if I did. SO talking with dad he was in one of those moods too. looked outside and it was kinda gloomy outside but it wasnt dark. SO we decided we would go catch one service call that was right by our house then call it a day. Really fun day, cause I got payed for half a day also. After that we came home and I played guitar for a couple hours till emily got done with school. (shes doing the dental assisting program) She came over cause every monday night Her and my mom go to these classes where they learn to make gift cards and other stuff using stamps and crap like that. It's called ""Stampin up!"" SO they dragged me along, cause I didn't have anything better to do, and I wanted to be with em tonight. It was kinda fun, of course with me being the only guy there I got alot of those. ""He's such a man"" jokes, cause of the way I decorated my card. Gotta love women. So we came home, early since we got to go earlier then normal. We stoped by walgreens and got one of my christmas presents. A Guitar clock thats glows neon. So after there we went home. I found out that Van helsing came out today, so tomorrow I gotta go to walmart and pick it up :). (<--- movie whore) After getting home me and em sat in the living room and talked to mom about ""The crypt keeper"" and why we don't like her being there lol. It's not that we don't like her, its just she gets into everything even though she has nothing to say, and she smells cause she doesn't take baths. Evertime she comes over we have gnats around the house for days. It's disgusting. She is leaving wednesday though, Thank God. (forgive me jesus, and bless the starving pygmies in new guiniea) ANyway em left at 9:30 to get home by 10:00, and I decide I would type out this entry while I was off the phone.

Tomorrow It's supose to be me, dad and scott. I like working when there is more help, :) and scott is a cool guy. I think were supose to wire another sunroom. I can't wait till wednesday I not only get to learn ""Comfortably numb"" I also get to spend time with emily.....again :) Tomorrow is not bad either I get to go over and eat eith em and her parents tomorrow night too. I'm getting tired now and emily should be calling me soon.

"event","SO I woke up today feeling a little bit sick from last night, but it got better as the day progressed. Today was just one of those launge around days, Something I haven't had in awhile. Much more of this and I won't be able to stand it.

I woke up around 9:00 with a little bit of drainage, nothing big, by the time I was out of the shower everything was fine. I called emily and decided I would come on over, before lunch and we would just stay over there for the rest of the day since we had been at my house all weekend. So I drove over there and got there before her mom did. So we went back to her room and started watching tv untill her mom came home. Her dad was at blacksmithing all day which he does one sunday a month. Her mom got home, and we argued a little bit over where to eat, we eventually decided on wendy's. After we ate, we layed around and finished watching blankman, or tried too. (Emily wasn't into it) So we went in the living room and talked with her mom a little bit, her dad came home shortly after. We then started putting our puzzle together which once its finished I will post a picture of it. After finishing the outside rim of it and getting frustrated cause we couldn't get started with the inside, we left it alone for the night. It's was close to dinner time, so her dad said he was hungry, we all debated on where to go and decided to go to ""Exotic wings and things"" good stuff, I got the lemon pepper wings, which were awesome. em got hot wings which her mom ended up eating cause she got the wrong ones her mom got the mild wings, which instead of mild sauce had ketchup on em. Her dad got lemon pepper wings also. After we ate, we went back to her house, and finished watching blankman......finally, and then I came home. Not a very exciting day, but thats what lounge around days are for. 

Me and emily keep finding songs, we want in our wedding. Found some good piano stuff for the people seating, we want Eric clapton- Tears in heaven played somewhere during the wedding. Course if it was up to me ""Here comes the bride"" would be replaced with ""Ozzy- Crazy train"" or ""Guns n roses- sweet child o mine"" but unfortunatly only me, aaron, micah, and drew, would be the only ones to appreciate that. Her mom wants me to record The song I wrote for emily and have it played during the unity candle lighting. I think it would be cool, I just want it to be done professionally. So anyway thats today, boring but fun. I'm off to bed, I really don't want to go to work tomorrow. 

Slap me around and call me Susan!

"event","Emily got me sick :(. I never get sick. Grrr thats what women will do for ya :) (love ya babes). Anyway it all started this afternoon, when I started getting a mild headache. I still have it :( except now its worse, and with all the lights its killing me. 

I woke up around 9:00 this morning. Had a good night sleep, and waited a bit to call emy. She calls me instead about 20 minutes later, after talking for a few minutes mom asked me if me and em would go get groceries for her since, her knees have been hurting her. I said yes being the good boy I am. So me and em went to wal mart together a little while later. Stoped by the elctronics again to see if they had a eric clapton cd. So I walk out of wal mart with ""The cream of clapton"" AND ""Resident evil the movie"" :) I'm such a movie whore. So while were in wal mart mom calls me and tells me my grandmother whom I forever will call ""the crypt keeper"", wants me to come pick her up since my aunt and uncle are leaving for georgia. Not a bad request except. A. I'm with emily B.It's our 7 month anniversary C. She lives in the boonies. and D. I have groceries in my car. So anyway after leaving walmart we drive to ""Slapout"" to pick up ""the cryptkeeper"", I get there and my aunt and uncle are sitting on the couch watching the football game with my lazy cousin, who could have brought her. So I drive her home drop her off and me and emily lay down for a nap cause we were a little tired. After a couple hours we got up and went to olive garden.

Olive garden was packed at 5:30 and we waited till about 6:15 to get a table. By this time my head was killing me. After unscrewing the lightbulb that seemed to be there to piss me off more then anything, we ordered our food. Em got the sampler platter, which had chicken fingers, toasted ravioli, and calamri. It was good :) I got the Chicken alfredo, as always. After eating we drove home the back way hoping for dark roads so the lights wouldn't feel like knives in my forhead. Unfortunatly we got a retard behind us who road our butt the whole way. So we got home and turned on resident evil, put the lights out , and layed on my bed and watched it. I slept through most of it, then I took em home.

I don't think im going to church tomorrow, My head is killing me, and we never had practice so it really won't matter if im there or not. unfortunatly aaron won't be there either, so it will just be Justin on keyboard, and noah on drums. Owell I have been there almost every sunday for the past 4 months since I started, I don't feel bad for missing 1 sunday. I'm about to go to bed head is still hurting. Sorry if I have seemed pissy or rushed this entry.

Gnight ned!

"event","Well I'm typing this in fustration cause I just typed this whole entry and went to post it and it said there was an error about the dang time, THE &&%%&( time. So It erased my post. I will try to do my best.
Did it again owell I save it this time muhahaha so whatever the hour says its wrong its 12:48.
I just got back from taking emily home, we decided not to go out tonight cause we remembered that tomorrow is our 7 month anniversiary, making it a whole 1 year and 1 month weve been together. We dated for 6 months 3 years ago. 

Today went as usual, I got up and went to work. It wasn't that hard of a day just long, we wired a sunroom, which isn't hard, just time consuming. Normally we can just drill holes run a little bit of wiremold and leave 3 hours top. This was on a concrete slab, so after drilling a whole for a hour and trying to fish a wire into the attic, we finaly get done and home about 4:45. Dad was pissy all day today, I don't think hes feeling well. Hes one of those guys who won't ever say anything, but you can tell cause hes not acting like usual. So after I got home and took a shower, I went to go pick up emily. We grabbed some fast food, and took it home, like normal. Watched some tv fell asleep till 11:15, left and got her home by 11:45 then came back home to post this. I enjoy spending time with her, sounds boring but really anytime I get to spend with her is the best time i've ever had. I hope these feelings never end, I mean don't get me wrong we fought about 40% of the time she was here. :) But it was more fighting just so we could laugh at each other when it started turning serious. I showed em the stuff me and aaron recorded last night, she liked it. After that I played around with ""drewbot"" untill em got pissed at me. (she was trying to watch tv :) So I put Drewbot up with a pat to the head, Put my Jackson charvel on the stand and crawled up next to her. :) 

On the way home I listned to my Charlie daniels band cd. Don't get me wrong i'm not a country fan by any means. But playing guitar with jeff galey has opened my eyes to view more then just spectrum of guitar playing. As a matter of fact older country lead guitar playing is harder then heavy metal/rock lead playing. Cause Country players think ""outside the box"". Although staying ""in the box"" sounds great over anything, being able to play outside of it and it sound good is a whole different ball game. I feel like im rushing through this entry. man I need to start writing these in notepad. owell I'm off, been a long day and im tired.

"event","If I had to describe the way I feel about working for my dad with a song, it would have to be (Twisted sister- were not gonna take it). I'm sure most of you know working for a relative especially for your dad you gonna get chewed out more, and picked on more, then anyone else. So today was just one of those days, luckily eddie and scott both worked with us so it wasn't that bad a day at work. I'm just dreading tomorrow.

I got up this morning at 7:30 as usual and left for work with my dad, we went to the shop where we met eddie. Working with eddie is like working with Jim Carey's Ace Ventura character all day, Really fun to work around. So he lightened up the mood for the most part, I swear My dads business could immitate ""Orange county choppers"". So the day goes on and I end up getting home around 3:45. I come in sit down and realize I have guitar practice at 4:30, so I don't have time to take a shower so I just leave and get there at like 4:20. I swear my time estimating is off, if im suppose to be somewhere at 7:00am I'm gonna get there at 5:00. So I get there at 4:20, walk in and find jeff finishing up a current lesson. (He doesn't mind if people come in while hes giving lessons as long as there quiet) So I sit down in the back of his music room, and listen to them playing ""Stairway to Heaven"". I start dosing off, lol I didn't realize how peaceful that song is. So anyway they wrap up, and I sit down for my lesson. We played ""Eric Clapton- Crossroads"" together. First time through we jammed through the whole song without mistakes man that song is fun as crap to play. Second time through Jeff was gonna put it on a tape for me so I could remember how it went. Usually he does this by himself so tehre are no screw ups, but this time he told me to do the lead part while he did rythm, so I was like ok. First time through the chorus and vers we did great, but after that I screwed up so many times I think if eric clapton heard me he would have shot me for even picking up a guitar. Actually it wasn't that bad just im one of thos people if I mess up, I feel the whole world just heard me. After we tore that song up, it was about 5:00pm, then next guy for lessons had come in while we were playing the first one, so I was like yeah man hes gonna think im awesome. He sits down and I get ready to leave, when jeff invites me to stay for another lesson so I could hear him. This guy thatcame in is a student of jeff's that has been playing with him for about 2-3 years. They start playing Some song I've never heard, and smoke up the place man, I swear my jaw is still hanging. After that 3 minute flawless song, they play ""Pink floyd- comfortably numb"" together. Man I wish you could have heard em, the stident did the lead to it, man and it was beautiful. So after they get through playing, and making me feel like I just picked up a guitar for the first time, jeff looks over at me and he says ""We can start on comfortably numb next week if ya want"" I was like heck yeah. So I'm excited about next week, it makes me feel good to know being self taught for 4 years prior to taking lessons with jeff, I was doing everything right. After that song the next person came in and me and (were gonna call him Opie cause he has red hair) Opie leave jeff's and I head home.

After leaving Jeff's mom calls me and ask me to run to wal-mart to pick her up something for tomorrow, I say sure. So while im there I go get what she wanted and say to myself (hmmm lets go look at the movies) so I head on over to electronics, and see a 2 for $11 sign on some dvds I'm like woohoo, well I only found 1 but it was good enough I had to buy it. Blankman with david wayans, lol if you have never seen this and you are a wayans brothers fan you need too. So anyway I head home, to meet aaron who is coming over to play guitar for a couple hours. He gets here and we start playing around with the guitar and ""Drewbot"" the drum machine. Man that is the best investment I have ever made, it's like having Drew there all the time, except ""Drewbot"" can't do everything drew can do :) but still its cool, me and aaron recorded ""Acdc- Back in black"" with the drum machine, which I need to send to drew. ""Drewbot"" really makes recording and playing by myself a whole lot funner. After that we recorded the guitar and drum machine to one of aaron's songs hes written. He left maybe a hour ago. 

SO after he left I went and took  shower, called emily, who had to keep kids tonight :(. She hasn't been feeling good lately, wished I could bethere to take care of her. We talk for about 10 min before she starts dosing off on the phone, so I let her go to bed. Tomorrow it's supose to be just me and dad (bleh). Oh well TGIF right? Think me and emily might go out to eat tomorrow night, I want to take her someplace romantic, exciting, somwhere she hasn't been before. But to get any of those I would have to leave birmingham unfortunatly. Owell more then likely we'll go to hooters then back to my house as usual and fall asleep on my bed watching tv, I swear we already act like a married couple. Owell time for bed I guess, can't believe I'm going to bed at 10:00, I can remember when I would stay up till 1:30 playing ""Dark age of camelot"" or ""Tribes"" even. Now its bed at 10:00-10:30 up at 7:30. Man if getting older gets any worse i'm picketting.
So anyway I'm off to bed.

In case I don't see ya good afternoon, good evening, and good night.

"event","So it's 10:00pm here, and I figured I would finish writing the rest of my day. This journal is starting to get addicting, anyway On with the show.

On my way to jeff's I recieve a call, look down at my cell phone and guess who it is? Jeff Galey, I'm like aaaahhh crap hes gonna cancle on me. He just wanted to tell me the 5:30 slot behind mine was acually filled, so aaron who was gonna take that slot, couldn't. A week earlier I remember him telling me the person in front of me at 4:30 moved his to 4:00. So I asked if that slot was still open, he said it was so My new guitar time is at 4:30 then aaron goes at 5:00. He better take good care of that time, it has treated me very well. So I call aaron after talking with jeff and arange all that crap, and he tells me hes on his way to meet me so we can ride together. I'm like great, cause its already 4:30. So we finally get there at 5:00 and I just let aaron go ahead and take his lesson, so I'm gonna go tomorrow at 4:30. After aaron did his 30 min. we left and I took aaron back to his car, then I went to go see Emily.

Arriving at emily's house I am greeted by her lovely face, i go in and find out there having chilli, which I normally like but her family over does it on the tomatoe sauce (Sorry babe :) So I ate bisquits N gravy, man it was good. After that me and em went into her room and talked about stuff, she actually started her on journal too, So i'm happy. I left her house around 9:00 cause her mom was going to bed and she wasn't feeling good. Was kinda sad as I always am when leaving her, but cheered up when I got home My Fcb1010 Foot controller for my effects processor came in along with a 1/4"" chord for my Drum machine. I went to plug in my controller and realize I ordered the wrong dang chord, musicians friend has great prices but are a little vague about there chords and guitar strings. I ordered a mic chord. Good part is now I get to order, not only a midi cable but also a microphone, cause my acoustic amp has a mic plug in (evil laugh) Oh and another foot pedal for my drum machine to do fills. I'm excited again anyway I'm going to bed.

"event","Well its 4:00pm on a wednesday, that means im loading up my Guitar and heading to Guitar lessons. The guy I am learning from right now is prety awesome, His name is Jeff galey, and from what I know hes pretty popular in the guitar world. Hes been with alot of famous people but he never made it extremely big. Hes one of those guys who is a great guitar player, toured a bit in the 80's, married 6 times, and is now playing a gig at a motorcycle resort. Hes a cool guy to talk too and to learn from.

I met him actually through another guitar player/dealer around here in Birmingham named Lefty. My acoustic guitar's 3rd fret was making this horrible buzzing sound when I would play a Gmaj chord. Not havng ever used anyone around town, I went to the first place I thought might could help. It was purely God that I was hooked up with Jeff. I went on a monday to lefty's when they are normally closed, got there right when him and his wife/girlfriend was going in to check on something. I met him at the door and told him my problem and he told me to bring it in and let him look at it. (Pretty cool guy I thought) So I took it in and he checked it out, and said the ""nut"" on my guitar had to be replaced. he said he couldn't do it but he knew a great guy who did. So he gave me Jeff's name and number and sent me to him. I called him within 15 min of leaving lefty's and he told me to come on over too his house. I get there and come down to his basement to see guitars everywhere and some recording equipment. We get to talking and hit it off pretty well, after talking with him about 15 min he says he does guitar lessons. (lightbulb) I had been actually looking for a teacher for a couple months now. Cause at the time I was self taught and was at a point where I needed a instructor on some things I wasn't sure about. I asked him how much and when could I start. the next wednesday I was there check in hand. He only charged me 5 bucks to change the strings on my acoustic and tighten the tuner nobs. So I have been going to him for about 2 months now and have already used stuff hes shown me on sunday mornings. 

So Before I went I decided I would write another entry in my new journal. I'm enjoying this, gives me kind of an outlet to vent, Even when im not angry. After practice I'm heading over to emily's for dinner and to hang out there. I've been missing her, even though ive seen her the past few days. Just cause I'm use to it being just me and her, talking and doing stuff together. Ive had to share her the past couple of days with her family. This weekend my parents are supose to go out of town (Party at Rusty's), but my mom's arthritis in her knees has been acting up and the windshield wipers in my dad's truck work fine untill it rains and then they stop working. So doesn't look good for the weekend. Owell I'm off to practice. 

Untill next time

"event","For those of you that know me, you will be happy to know I started a new diary. my last one went for a record 3 entries before I got too busy to update, hopefully this one will go better. SO anyway onto my day.

Today went like normal, I got up at 7:30, got ready and went to work. I work with my dad as an electrician. Today was one of those boring but cool days where we run around catching service calls, like going to change a ballast or reset tripped breakers. So most of the day was spent in the truck reading my New issue of Guitar world. around 12:00 we were near our house so we stopped there to eat lunch and went back out about 1:30. Did a couple more service calls then came back home around 3:00. Emily was at her grandmothers funeral all day, today Wished I could have gone with her, but scott didnt work with us today. so we were shorthanded. After I got home Justin calls me and ask me if im going to band practice tonight. ( I play in the church band) I really don't like doing tuesday practices cause the songs we do are extremly easy, and I forget everything we do by sunday morning, which we go back over the songs at 7:30 on sunday mornings anyway. SO when he asked me if I was coming to meet him for practice I told him that em was at a funeral all day and I wasn't going to be able to make it cause I wanted to see her. Then he asked me about thursday night, geez I like doing it don't get me wrong but seriously its not like I don't have other things to do during the week. O well at least that puts him off till thursday. (Now to think of a excuse for thursday) 

So I went over to emily's house around 7:00 pm and am greeted by Olivia our 3 year old niece....(I think), Anyway she's really cute, shes gonna be the flower girl in our wedding. So after spending a few hours there Drew calls me. So I blow off some steam talking to him telling him about my church band woes, cause he understands he used to be the drummer at our old church. after talking to him for about 30 min I went back inside till about 10:00 then left. Stoped by the quick-e-mart to get a Code red (yeah baby), then went home called emily to tell her I made it ok. Then decided to start up my new account. cool huh :) so here it is 10:44 and im writing about whats currently happening.......nothing. It's like in Spaceballs when they put in the movie and fastforward to now. Ahhhh Mel Brooks, one of the most brilliant comedians of our time. ok well im not gonna bore you with anything else tonight. Unless I can't sleep. :)

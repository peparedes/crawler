"event","Basically today I woke up finding my left arm asleep, yeah it was fun...Actually it hurt really bad...So then it woke up, while I went back to sleep. Then I woke up at around 12:00 p.m, later on I got out of bed, went in my room and had a depressive slump, then I played some MSI and C&C. (Mindless Self Indulgence, Coheed and Cambria) Hmm..what else, oh yeah I think I layed down, watched some FMA, went back on the computer, slept, went back on the computer, myspace...Oh yeah, still waiting on my cell phone to come back to me. -sadface- Still, it was a really fun/shaking night. Well yeah, Part 2 is coming tomorrow. Later."

"event","<P><STRONG>Okay so to start off my Live Journal, I might as well tell you my weekend. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>(More to the story I just didn't post it)</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Okay so I could go on and on ya? Well I guess I'll just fill you in on the basics and how it leaded up to tonight....It was just this Saturday -Me, Mario, Andy, Alex (his cousin), and Falco. We were all hanging out at Mario's....etc.etc.etc. (i'll skip all this because they're not included) Yeah so it's dark everyone left by then, Mario and I call Cj's house on my phone, we said some funny lines which you can ask since I won't put them here. So we hang up....I think we called again I'm not sure right after that but, we called again and said more stuff....then around Midnight we called again.....Next day rolls around, Sunday. We call again pretending to be someone else that he and we knew. Just to inform you Mario was barely included in this, just had his voice going over the phone so don't blame him....To get on with this, it is now Monday which is today, around 7:45 p.m, Andy and I call Cj's house we pretend to be someone which was actually super funny the best one we did.....Not laughing now though...-sadface- yeah so, then it ended and she got Andys' number and talked to him and his dad and she said something about taking ""AFFIRMATIVE ACTIONS"" -A.K.A police- Yeah okay how about I show you the letter your little goody goody son wrote after the first harmless prank, yeah your son has issues. Anyway then she gets my number and talks to me and bitches and bitches, then she has the nerve to call again and talk to my dad, which went okay....Dad was a little okay with it, mom was good about it....So the lesson here kids is, If you're going to prank call, be sure to press *67 first! :-)</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Basically tonight sucked and was sort of okay....If anyone 'caused as much trouble it was mostly me, so yeah until next time, later. :-)</STRONG></P>"

"event","I have had 3 really great friends..that have all moved on and don't give a shit about me anymore and I have nothing else to wonder except am I a bad friend? Or just easily forgotten. It started with casey but at least he moved to mississippi so he has some kind of excuse...but christian...he was right there with kristi and erin...we talked everyday and hung out all the time..and now he doesn't give me a second thought. He's completly changed as a person and it really sucks. Even though our friendship had random gaps...he always came back.. but when nick and I were having problems...he didn't want to talk..and then when we took a break..he had no fucking clue. How can you just uproot yourself from someones life? The last time we hung out he was bored and just talked about doinf other things..but I just miss the good times. Sitting in the convertible listening to louis armstrong.. late night hangouts... when it was okay for us just to sit and have fun..and not have to fucking party to be entertained. When I could talk to him about any and everything..
Then there's tyler.. talked all day everyday for a good while. Then started hanging out like 3 to 5 times a week. Id visit him at work.. wed all go to dennys..late walks.. and then somehow...now if he sits 5 tables away from me at sns I have to ignore him because he's too awkward with me. If I try texting him..it last maybe 5 texts... I mean.. all I've got ia that its gotta be me. I never just quit on them. Fuck.

On a brighter note. Matt and jenni are getting married next month! And I get to be a bridesmaid in yellow!.Nick and I are absolutely perfect now and moving into our bigger apartment next month. Duke and all. And its gonna save money big time. Also I've got kristi and erin who NEVER fail me. Were lovers for life. So..fuck all my temporary friends. I'm glad I gave up because its too much work trying to force friendships."

It's like.. bad thing. bad thing. bad thing. and all you can do about it is cry. but i haven't cried in a long time so it kinda feels good but it's the annoying kind.. you an't just cry on the drive home and be better. i was trying to talk to justin about my mom being annoying and i cried. how embarassing. i'm so sad about them moving to florida its stupid. because i want them to go. i want my dad to feel good and be happy. but it just means i'll never see them. fuck me. and i have to move out in a month.. and maybe nicks not ready to move out and this is stressing him out that it's actually here. maybe. maybe i'm gonna go put on The O.C. .. season 2.. and watch it until i fall asleep and remember how great life was when the o.c. was still being aired every thursday night. god. did anyone else realize that after it went off air.. it was just never the same. ahah. not saying it's affectnig anything but really.. I&nbsp;LOVED those times. I&nbsp;LOVe thinking of sitting there and watching the oc and having something so awesome to look forward to every week. <br /><br />now i have nick to look forward to. every morning. noon. and night. and i guess really. there is nothing better than that. and i mean it when i say i never want that to go away. i want to be with him. always. forever. because that's when i'm happiest. and when i think of my life without him i want to throw up. because i know there is no way i could be complete. i want to always love him. i want him to always love me. we're about to make a big move.. literally. going from our laid back lives.. stressing about money already.. and now.. moving out and having rent and bills to pay. fan.fucking.tastic. but honestly.. i can't think of anything better.. than living with him... nothing. staying out late and going home every night. to our home. to our bed. together allthe time. god... sounds amazing. -sigh- i'm not even questioning how this will be... we're really taking the next step in starting our lives together.. and thats what i told my parents...<br /><br /><br /><br /><em><span style=""font-size: x-small"">i have had an amazing life with them for the past 20 years.. and now its time for me to start the rest of my life.. with nick....</span></em>"

dad-We're thinking of moving to Florida. Would you come with us?
me-whats making you think of going to florida again?
dad- i'm afraid of being here in the winter. the only thing keeping me feeling good is going outside and working everyday and when the winter comes I'll have to stay inside and i'll sleep all day and that'll be the death of me. I'll sleep all the time and then just not walk up.
me- well yea then. I would say go somewhere warm.
dad- what would you do if you didn't go with us? don't you think you'd miss me?
me- yea.. i'd miss you a lot
dad- I&nbsp;know I'd miss you. you're my deciding factor on whether or not I&nbsp;can even start looking. I'd miss you so much.
me- I'd miss you too dad.. you're the only reason I'm not in California right now.
dad- do you think you could make it out there right now.
me- yea. Nick and I could easily if we make at least 500 a paycheck.
dad- how much do you figure an apartment is down there?
me- 1000... 1100..
dad- really?&nbsp;did you look into it.
me- yea
dad- that seems cheap.
me-yea I know. and (i explained the apartment)
dad- did you like california more than florida?
me- yes. I fell in love with L.A.

Last week, Spring Break, was the best week of my life. Nick agreed that it was for him too. It was just PERFECT! amazing in everyway.

Friday morning we woke up only getting FOUR hours of sleep!! then we hit the road at 7 in the a.m. It was really fun! we didn't even listen to music because we just talked about any and everything the whole way there.. Then we got to Tenn. and I FREAKED out. like.. litereally.. going around the mountains was SO SCARY!! and EVERYONE was either ON my ass completly or FLYING by me.. I WAS GOING FUCKING 60!!! Give me a fuckin break!! and the speed limit was 55. So when we FINALLY got outta there I had to pull over and relax. becuase I was so stressed. So we stopped and ate lunch at Tachi Ding Ding.. (taco bell) AHAH! and then we got backo n the road.. WELL then we go stuck in Georgia traffic and got lost on the roads and it was RETARDED. NOONE could give us fucking directions on how to get back to i-75 South. and I was SO PISSED~!!!$% Then we FINALLY found someone who knew.. and then we left atlanta.. and hour later a tornado hit Atlanta right where we were and killed and injured people. fuckin creepy. then we drove to his aunts house. The only thing is.. getting lost adn shit.. we spent an extra FIVE hours on the road and I had only had 4 hours of sleep.. So I started freaking out hardcore and hallucenating. and I had to drive like.. 50 and then I practically stopped anytime a semi was near me because I was freakin out. made me realize I will NEVER do drugs.. because if it's ANYTHING like that.. fuck you. because I was seeing bridges getting smaller and then not being able to  fit under them and it was squishing me!! FUCKING SCARY!! and then Nick had to talk me through it and explain there was not bridges and I was gonna be okay and we were only 45 min away  from being there. It was the worst thing that's ever happened to me I swear. I was TERRIFIED!! but we got there and I don't even member getting there or going to sleep... I just woke up there. fuckin weird.

I don't really want to get into all these details because noone cares.. but.. heres what we did in Florida:
went to the beach a lot
went to some different peirs
went shopping
went to the movies to see this fucked up movies that only had a few saving graces to make it good.
went to the best/coolest zoo in the world!! with THREE different breeds of giraffes! 
went out to eat at a lot of nice resturaunts.. One of them was on the beach during the sunset with live music! 
ate at Little Caesars and got TWO bags of crazy bread for $2!!!!!!! best thing EVER!!~
Then we FINALLY ate at a Waffle House!!! which was amazing! Waffle Houses are  CRAZY in the South! they LOVE em!! There is AT LEAST one.. sometimes TWO! On EVERY single exit on the way to Florida! it's ridic! they're like South=Waffle house as Indiana=Starbucks. ridic! ahah. but it was awesome and we loved it! 

We did other things as well.. I can't think of it all right now. prolly the best part was going home together every night and sleeping together. I really miss that. We weren't apart for more than time to shower in Florida.. and when I had to say goodbye to him I cried because we were both so sad about leaving eachother. I'm literally depressed because I miss being around him 24/7 and I couldn't sleep until 2 last night even tho I was exhausted because he wasn't there =[ lame maybe. but I'm so madly in love with him all I want to do is marry him and live  an awesome life together in Florida. yea... we talked about moving o Florida. and it's a serious thought. We loved it there. it's like that episode of Boy Meet World where Corey and Tapanga go on their honeymoon and never want to go home because it's paradise. We're gonna move there probably. and I can't wait.. 

I got the worst welcome home EVER!! It's like ""Hi! Welcome home!! get your coat its FUCKING FREEZING AND SNOWING!! BE MISERABLE!! REMEMBER THE BEACH!?!?! HOW ABOUT HIS WAFFLE HOUSE HERE!!! REMIND YOU OF WHEN YOU WERE HAPPY!?!"" then we say Indiana and hated it!... 


.... we miss florida..... i miss everything about the last 10 days of my life..."

EVERY and ANYtime someone wants to hang out.... I have to drive an hour to do so... this is a LOT of gas... Gas... is $4 a gallon... I... have no money.. That's pretty much my life story.. but I do it.. anytime someone wants to hang out. So can I just PLEASE point out that it's a drive for me and I don't really have the gas to do it..&nbsp;

just so you're aware..&nbsp;&nbsp;

I'm not trying to be bitchy.. I just wanna make you aware because I know noone ever thinks about it. I know.. EVERYONE but me is in the same city.. but it's not my fault!! I have no control over where I live. And I want to move to Indy.. but I can't really afford it right now.I can't afford a house payment alone.

So it's getting warmer now.. so I just want to advertise... that my house is real fun when it's warm! and I live only like.. 20 min away from Edinburg mall.. which is always fun. and people should want to come hang out here sometime. just saying. to let you know. it's hard for me to get there all the time. j2lyk. but I love you all to death. i'm just having an annoying day. and i thought about this.but I have to go to bed now.. so i can get up and drive alllll the way to school.... then allll the way into indy to only hang out with kristi a lil =( and Nick a lot =] because I won't be seeing him enough over the next week! ahah.&nbsp; But Kristi and I aren't gonna get very much time and that's lameo. and Nick and I are FINALLY gonna see No Country For Old Men!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we've been waiting since before it even came out.. it kinda came out the same time as Lars... so maybe!!!!! Lars and the Real Girl will be coming out soon!!! .. I just got my hopes up.. bad idea."

Kristi and I found like.. THE MOST PERFECT apartment today and we put in an app. It's amazing. oh god. it was so fun just going around and looking at apartments!! we rock at life! although this one was REALLY scary and we didn't end up going in... ironically it's address was 187 too.... SHPOOKY!!! we're fucking awesome tho. I'm SO pumped.. I wish I could move out like.. TOMORROW. I'm in love with it! I can't even explain. It's gonna be amazing when we move out together.. and the decorating!! yea.. can't wait!

I got new hairs.. you've prolly seen it. Some don't like it.. well.. only Christian doesn't but that's cool. I'd rather people be honest.. but I have INDEED gotten WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY more complements then any other hair i've had lately I think. Because at the mall today.. EVERY store we went in.. or when we went to Luca to get breadsticks.. someone said they loved it and asked where I got it done. Even the asshole guy at Luca said it was awesome. Weird shit. And my english teacher.. which was funny because he's the last person you would expect to even MENTION hair. ahah. but it was so cute. Nick LOVES it and I'm in LOVE with it! It's like.. the best thing I've ever decided. It looks WAAAAAAAAAAY better if you see it in person tho. j2lyk. if you haven't yet. but within all the nice things people say... there was one comment that DOES and ALWAYS HAS pissed me off... I DON'T FUCKING LOOK ASIAN!! SO FUCK PEOPLE WHO THINK I DO!!!!!! And no.. my hair is NOT or has EVER been BLACK! EVER!! compare Kristis hair.. to mine.. BLACK.. BROWN! MY HAIR IS FUCKING BROWN! I WOULD NEVER HAVE BLACK AND It'S REALLY ANNOYING!!! SO I'M NOT FUCKING ASIAN AND I HAVE BROWN HAIR!!!! kay?

My dad had a stroke on Dec.22. And it sucked. but let me brag about how wonderful Nick is. He just held me while I cried and then told me that he knew what I was going through and he's 100% there for me. And was just.. omg. too too sweet and REALLY helpful.. because he was REALLY there when I needed him the most. But I just want to say. My dad is better =] and he was home for christmas. So it all worked out in the end. He just needs to never scare me like that again! and Erin and Kristi. fucking awesome. they called/ texted and let me know they were there for me.. as if I didn't already know and asked what they could do. I love Nick. I love Erin and Kristi. I have the best people I could possibly have in my life.

Next subject.

I'm a fucking loser. Literally. When Nick is gone I'm just a loser. I sit at Jennis alone. It's fucking retarded. He's not gonna be home tomorrow.. so I'm starting the New Year... alone. Without Nick... and I get no New Year kiss when the ball drops ='( and I'm really broke hearted about it. He thinks its just silly.. and it prolly is. I just really miss him and I wanted to start out the new year with him and for him to be here with me. Thank god Jenni invited me to go with her where ever she ends up tomorrow. So that's good.. because I was just gonna go home and be alone. I dunno.. Maybe he'll pull a Ryan Atwood. We'll never know... I just hope the doors unlocked if he does. aha.

annnd Lastly

Kristi and I are fucking hills! we went to Wal*Mart last night and bought me giraffe socks and listened to the OLDEST music! like.. shit we used to listen to all the time. it was amazing! it was so much fun!! Then we went to Starbucks and she had to reverse twice! for going the wrong way er something. it was hilarious!! and then we were walking in Starbucks and we saw Zach Barr and Chris Renfro and we walked up to the door and started laughing hysterically and then ran back to the car! aahha people had to have thought we were intoxicated! then we went to the drive thru and she bought me my Venti 8-pump White Mocha. &gt;drools&lt; I died a little and for that.. I love her. =] and then WE JUST SAT IN THE PARKING LOT!!! singing and listening to some REALLY bad music and some good old tunes from the day! it was amazing! ahaha. then we just went to her house.. made a list of good driving songs from back in the day music and watched old Drive- Thru videos! it was amazing! R2K is sooo funny. it made me really sad tho. .. some things did. I used to love some of those people and they all just fucked up. faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaags. I dunno. I don't particularly like music that brings me back to certain times.. unless it was a really good time. i dunno. weird shit. but we had a lot of fun! aha.

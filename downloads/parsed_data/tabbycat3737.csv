                                       LOVE  Tabby

Just a question I want to know if u think this is the right thing to do my boyfriend goes over to his ex-girl friends house sometimes and he knows that it bothers me but should I just say what I have been saying like they were friends before I came along so they still should be I just feel that if he had the choice to hang out with me or to hang out with her I would hope he would pick me eight out of ten times I don't know I could just be a total bitch what do you think?"

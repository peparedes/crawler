Zach and I went to Madison today, and it was fun.  I am proud of myself for driving and not getting us stuck in Iowa or something.  Our next trip is going to be Waukesha, damnit, haha.

Ok, I DO NOT need anymore Badger apparal or accessories.  Today, I bought a sweatshirt, two t shirts, a keychain thing, and another window sticky.  I'm done, I need no more.  But I DO really want that stuffed Bucky that plays the fight song thinger, because he's cute :)

Um yeah, I'm going to go finish eating this grapefruit and relax and watch some TV...that went into too much detail"

This weekend was the same as any weekend...Friday night, we went to Kitchen and hung out.  Then Saturday, I drove by and Sam and Kuhn were there, so I stopped in, and other people then showed up, and 'twas fun.  Today, I went to church, and then came home and was lazy.  I need to start my homework at some point now :)

Some people kind of scare me.  I wish I didn't worry about particular friends, one particular friend as of late.  The past does not deserve to be dwelled on.


Oh wait, that's right, I almost forgot! Jamie and I went to see Hide And Seek last night.  It was really good, I would have to say it was better than The Grudge.  Jamie, once again, freaked out a bit.  You know, if I wasn't sitting there laughing at her covering her face, I probably would have been just as bad, haha.  Oh well.  I didn't just say that, Jamie, so don't rub it in.

Yay, tomorrow is Valentines Day!!! Oh wait, that's right, I have no reason to be excited about this, silly me! Just another day for me.  Stupid Valentines Day, so overrated.  It's a retail holiday if I have ever seen one.

It seems like the days went by very slow, but alas, tomorrow is already Friday.  Yay for the weekend.  Maybe this will be my weekend where I will do something that I once couldn't do because I was underage and now I am not.  I'm thinking it will be, haha.

Interesting thought: Going to the G-spot and buying edible underwear, but then eating them on your car ride home.  Hahaha, physics is so fun.

We went sledding yesterday in physics, and Celina, Becky, Gina, and myself completely biffed one of our rides down. I rolled backwards on my neck, kind of like a very slow backwards summersault.  There is one spot that hurts if I turn my neck in a certain way now.  Haha, it was still fun...I wasn't about to do it again though.

I'm not quite as rageful towards Ms. Andersen anymore, since she claims she has my balance all straightened out for the senior trip (we'll see about that).  I am not paying an extra $144 that she claims I owe, because I distinctly remember the moment I gave my money directly to HER.  Grr.  We made rooming assignments today too, and I think it's going to be pretty fun.  A week straight of Napoleon Dynamite, even though one of my roommates claims she will not resort to watching it under any circumstances, even though she has never seen it.  Geeze, lol.

Grr, I have lots of homework to get done, and I need to run to wal-mart.  I almost forgot that I need to work at the stupid Chili For Charity from 11-1 on Saturday.  National Honor Society sure likes to suck up all the extra money that I have.

Unless they are gay, which Zach suggested.  Then I guess I kind of lose, haha.  

We got report cards today, and I still have my grades, so I'm pretty happy.  Yay for me.  Now I can quit freaking out so much.  I filled out an application for Applebees, and I'm waiting to see if Zach calls to see if he wants to take our applications in.  I might fill out one for Pizza Hut quick too, even though my friends keep telling me they don't need waitresses right now, haha.  I guess I do have a bunch of other applications I have to get filled out too, grr.  I hate job hunting, but at this point, it's such a necessity.  

I'm not sure what to think of my second semester schedule yet.  It seems like the days go by MUCH slower, and maybe that is because I have second lunch, but who knows.  I definately think the workload will be brought down a bit though.  I may eat my words, but I really hope I don't.  

I already can't wait until the weekend, but I suppose it's reasonable because tomorrow is already Wednesday.  I want to do something that was once illegal for me but now isn't because I'm 18.  I'm still kind of set on getting something pierced, but I'll probably chicken out from eyebrow (or something) and just do another cartilage one.

Today, one of the greatest things a K-12 grade student could asked for happened.  School was cancelled due to the horrible ice storm the other night.  The superintendent of Wis. Rapids schools was on the news tonight, and he basically said there is a possibility that it might be cancelled again tomorrow.  I'm not counting on it, I guess. It WOULD be great though, the long Christmas break is, the better.  I do, however, wish that school cancellations came the night before.  That would be convenient for making plans.

I'm going to do some more reading tonight.  I drank quite a bit of coffee around 5ish/6ish, so I think this might be a late night.  Blah.  School blows.  This is another reason I wish cancellations came a day earlier.  Should I go to bed early or not? Hmm....

Well, one day less of hell to put up with until the end of the semester/school year.  My mother keeps throwing scholarships at me almost every day.  I do need the money, but I'm about scholarship-ed out.  I really don't count on getting most of these national ones, I'm up against people a zillion and one times better than I am. Oh well, I suppose it's worth the try...

I am so ready to get out of Nekoosa.  I want to be in Madison as I speak.  The school may kick my ass a little, but at least I'm going to have that kick in the ass from friends when I need it. That should keep me on my feet.  I can't wait to be in Madison.  I'm sure I'll miss little old Nekoosa at some point, but I'm ready for that.  I need a change, that's what I really need....  I need to meet new people, I've seen the same faces far too many times here.  It's not easy to meet new people in a small (unknown) town.  Sure, I'll have two of my best friends down there, and I'm quite thankful for that, but I have to get out and meet some new ones too. Wee, I can't wait."

Sam's house was a blast on New Years Eve.  I got pretty drunk, but not as out of control as last time.  By this I mean, no throwing up.  That was a relief.  I made some stupid phone calls, and I wish I wouldn't have.  I sent some stupid messages, and I wish I wouldn't have.  I guess that's what you get for being drunk, and...stupid.  We watched Napoleon Dynamite.  That is probably right up there with the greatness of Dumb and Dumber, in my opinion.  I went out and bought it because I liked it so much. It's definately worth the watch.  One thing I did learn on New Years is how great my friends are, and I really need to take heed in the advice they give me more often.  They know what's going on when I don't.  I don't feel like elaborating on this, so I'll leave it at that.

I feel SOMEWHAT accomplished tonight, sort of.  I got my sociology paper written, and I finished my small physics assignment.  I'm far too lazy to crack open my calculus book, so I think I will do that tomorrow.  Same with start my World Lit speech thinger, but then again, that's not due until the 18th.  I just finished the book the Wednesday or Thursday night that break began, and I should probably write it while the book is actually fresh in my head.  On the other hand, I need to get my ass going on my book for organic chem.  I told myself I was going to read it over break and get it finished.  Did that happen? No.  Oh well...  I'm going to read some tonight. 

I really don't want to go back to school tomorrow, breaks are too good to me.  Oh well, I'll grin and bear it.  Not too much longer to go.  I need this semester to get over with.  Come on, next three weeks, fly right by me."

I, of course, am still on the neverending quest to find an argyle sweater (and I swear on my life that I'm going to).  I was unsucessful today, unfortunately.  I did end up getting a new scarf and a pair of silky pajama pants from Old Navy.  I also found my mom a low-carb cookbook.  Anyways...

The Wausau Mall was...well, the Wausau Mall.  We went to Fazolli's after this experience.  We made racist comments, or rather, I made racist comments (well, supposedly...I just thought it was the truth...I won't go into depth, you can ask if you want details, haha).  It was so funny.  And then we went to Old Navy and Barnes and Noble, and blah blah blah...so then on our way out, we decide to stop at Wendy's.  They had a sign that said ""5 junior frosties for a dollar,"" so Zach insisted that we hit that up.  So we get to the speaker thing, and Zach orders (he was going to get 2 vanilla, 2 chocolate, and 1 strawberry just to be complicated, but the dude RUDELY said they only had chocolate, so we said that'd be fine) and then we were asked if we had the coupon for the frosties, and Zach QUIETLY said No, and he claims that the guy said ""I will give you a coupon"" back, but I swear I heard him simply repeat his question because Zach said it quietly....so anyways, Zach replies, again, ""sure."" I drive away.  We crack up.  What the crap? We didn't have a coupon!!! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!!!!!!!!! Good times...

So then, on our way out of there, we are on the interstate and we see another exit sign, and then a sign thaat had lodging crap and food crap...and we see another wendy's sign...so we decided we were going to go do the same thing again at a Wendy's in Schofield (?? I believe...).  So anyways, then we say ""Hey, we're in Schofield, Ryan works at Target in (or near) Schofield!"" We drive all over searching for Target, and we finally find it, and scream with joy (literally).  We went in and searched for Ryan, found him, and talked with him for a bit....well, actually, I sort of wandered.  I love Target.  I found a really soft blanket I want, and it would match my bedroom good.  I will have to tell my mom. Oh well.

Anyways, after that, we get lost trying to get back to the interstate (imagine that...unknown territory...), but we eventually did it.  And that's where my story ends.  I just got home now from taking everyone back home.  Oh wait, one more, we stopped at WAlgreens in Rapids on the way home, and Jamie and Zach went in and Jason and I stayed in the car.  Jamie got me the cutest softest teddy bear ever, he's my favorite.  But anyways...yeah...I'm home now.  I was hoping we would be a little earlier because I wanted us to stop at kitchen to see who all was there tonight since everyone is home for break and what not, but we didn't get back in town until almost midnight.  Oh well, no biggie :)  It was a fun night.  I am mucho tired now though!!

But anyways, I think I am going to wrap this up, write an e-mail, and get some sleep..."

Wow, I just started up my launch radio station...first song, great one...mwahaha

Back to the point of this...or lack there of...whatever...

Today was fun.  Well, as fun as school gets, you know?  It was an easy day...I missed 2nd, 3rd, and most of 4th for National Honor Society.  We delivered the Thanksgiving baskets, it was nice to be out of school for a bit.  In O-Chem, Zach researched how to make some crazy esters, and we made rancid butter (yes, rancid butter was the intended scent...). Guess what it smelled like!  Yes, that's right...it was so crappy.  We made rum scent too (or, excuse me Mrs. Walker, ""butterscotch""), and that smelled really good.  We also made one that smelled like rancid meat...haha.  Wow, I love chemistry.

So, I've been following my ""I'm GOING to lose weight plan"" for over a week now.  I do a really good work out everyday, I am eating more of those ""good for you"" foods, and I'm drinking a butt load of water everday (yes, a buttload).  It's nice, I feel better during the day, and it puts me in a better mood (perhaps this is the stress reliever I've been looking for...).  

Things seem to be going a bit better at school (as of right now).  I think I've settled down a bit, and have improved my school-related habits.  The next thing I need to work on is getting a little more sleep.  I feel like I have things pretty much under control, and that's a great feeling.  I hope it stays this way, at least until the end of the semester.  If I get that scholorship (and even if I don't, I guess), after first semester is done, all hell can break loose for all I care!

It feels nice, it's not even 9:30 yet!  Tomorrow, we're delivering baskets for National Honor Society (at least I think we are...), so I'll be doing that...and I really hope it's not an all day project..

So yeah, let's hear it for three-day weeks.  I also need to stop starting my paragraphs with ""So yeah."" I'm ready for the weekend already, and it's only Monday.  Wee. I want to go to a concert on Saturday night at the Mission.  It sounds good...yeah...great.

I need to make some serious cash before then, because I have to buy Christmas presents.  Life at this time of season was so much easier when I had a job.  Oh well.  Nothing would make me go back to Younkers! Nothing I say!!  I really can't wait to see my cousin.  I miss being young...when she'd be here a lot on the weekends because she and Aunt Gretch would stay with grandma.  Sadness.  Today, it was weird, I was thinking about stupid stuff we used to do.  Amanda, Nick, and I would play our game called impressions...where we would do impressions of all these people (usually people we didn't like), and we'd guess who they were...I don't know, it was just a funny, stupid thing we did.  And I miss making up stupid songs with Amanda.  I think I'm going to tell her at Christmas that we are due for another song.  Perhaps we should do some recording this Christmas.  Oh wait, we already did that on our awesome news broadcast that we made 4 or 5 years ago, haha.  Wow, good times were had...now we're all growed up :(

"event","I'm so happy tomorrow is Friday, but I must say, this has been a fairly easy week.  I have a German assignment I SHOULD be working on right now, but that can wait, like everything else I probably SHOULD do tonight (which isn't much).  This weekend will surely be full of relaxation.

This weekend, what to do, what to do?  Nothing of any significance is happening this weekend.  I don't know of any good concerts (but I havn't looked in the insert thingy in the paper that always lists them yet).  I wish I lived about 10 minutes from a good city, like Milwaukee, that gets awesome concerts all the time.  Oh well, I'll put that on my list of things to do.

I feel unappreciated for some reason, and I'm not sure why.  Maybe I'm just too full of myself.  I really hope that's not the case.  I feel like some people often forget that I exist too. I've been stupid like this lately.  I've also been having second thoughts about going to Oshkosh, but I know that decision is set in stone now.  I almost wish I would have chosen to go to Madison instead.  It makes me sad thinking about next year at this time...no more kitchen with my bestfriends every weekend.  Boredom?  I don't know, I just don't know...

So yeah, that ends that.  I have work to be done."

"event","Well, I'll have two half-days this week.  I couldn't sleep last night (imagine that), so I went into school at noon.  I missed part of a math test which I made up after school.  Aside from that, I doubt I missed much.  This is why I don't really mind missing half a day of school; my easiest classes are in the morning (besides calculus...which is fairly easy to catch up in, especially on test days). I have this down to an art...just kidding.  I really didn't feel all that great.  Yesterday wasn't the greatest day in the world.   I don't know.

Jason told me he's not ready to be in another relationship.  Meh.  I let myself get too attatched too soon. I'm sure others can vouch for that.  That's ok, I'd rather have him be ready for another relationship than be in one and be miserable with it.  There comes a day when I need to give up and realize that I'm only 17 years old.  Damn...17...

I feel like I'm a walking time bomb today.  I think I'm going to snap if anyone makes me mad.  At least I have a lower chance of this happening since I'm not in school...my sister just better watch out...haha, just kidding.  I'm going to get my homework done and go to bed, I think.  That's a good place for me.

So this all started Friday after school.  Zach, Jamie, Nikki, Laurel and I went to Pizza Hut and Awards and More (haha) and then Zach, Jamie and I Hung ou in town...took them back to the high school for musical practice...ended up meeting my mom and she forced me to go to conferences with her...blah blah blah....Jason came home on Friday night and him and I went up to the mission to see some bands, and we ended up meeting Adam and his girlfriend and Dallas and Sam up there.  Good times...then it was kitchen.  Then Jason came over and we watched part of The Meaning of Life.  And then um, on Saturday, Zach and I went to town and hung out and admired hats and scarfs (scarves?!) at Vanity.  After that, I went to the musical.  It was great, everyone did a really really good job.  Zach and Jamie came over afterwards, and then we went up to kitchen, met Jason there, and then we all went to walmart and ended up at my house...watched movies until 4 in the morning.  Fun stuff.  I sure do like that Jason..

I do not want to go to school tomorrow.  I have a math and a chem test I need to study for today.  I don't really want to.  Oh, but Tuesday is an early release day, so that is exciting, mwahaha.  Ok, I keep just clicking on random songs on my ""my music"" folder, and none of them are that good.  Just a random thought...

We were about half way to Marshfield, and the thunder and lightning becomes a bit more frequent, and then it just starts to DOWNPOUR.  I couldn't see a thing because it had been hazy and foggy all day, and my wipers really suck too.  So, we turned around and went back into Rapids (not to mention, turning around wasn't the smartest thing because we were driving BACK in what we just drove part way through..grr..).  We went to Hong Kong Buffet where Jamie decided it would be good for her to make racial comments in an (obviously) ethnic restaurant.  After this, we went to see The Grudge (hence the title of this entry).  It was freeeeeeeaaaaaaakkkkkkkkyyyyyyyyy!!  I liked it, but I admit, I slept with the TV on all night...hahaha.

I have sent all of my UW-Oshkosh stuff in.  I think it was a wise decision for me.  If not, well, oh well, haha.  It's not like I can't transfer in a while, if I feel the need to, of course.  I am considering going for a masters in nursing, in which case, I could probably just stay at Oshkosh.  Gah, who knows, I have time.  Plus, I have one more quarter to keep my grades up as high as they are, and I am sitting on a full tuition to Oshkosh, and let me tell you, that makes me (and my parents) sehr froelich. 

I have a lot of homework to get done this weekend! I think I am going to work on it today and tomorrow, for the most part.  Mrs. Walker just posted our 2-3 page essay on Complications (which isn't a bad one, by any means), I have to write my literary critique for World Lit and make it pretty, I am going to start reading and taking notes on the next chapter for O-Chem, I need to get some of my calculus practice assignments done, and it seems like there's one more thing, but I can't think of it right now.  None of it is too terrible...I'm keeping my head high now, haha. 

Oh yeah, I HAVE HAVE HAVE to get some scholarship essays taken care of this weekend, I need to stop pushing it off.  Gah...

Oh yeah, and Madison on Sunday for the day for my cousin's wedding.  I'm running out of time this weekend.

"event","Indeed it has.  Well, not much has really happened that's worth posting up until now, I suppose.  This weekend was a lot of fun.  I took Jason's brother and cousin to Oshkosh with me to stay with Jason and Adam.  We went to see Something to Do on Friday night, they were awesome (as expected).  After that, we all hung out in the dorm room and just watched ATHF and stuff.  Then on Saturday, Jason, Troy, Jake and I went to the mall in Appleton and Best Buy, and the weather got crappy, haha.  We survived. It was a pretty fun night.  I didn't want to leave on Saturday, but I figured my parents were expecting me home and such.... Next time I see Jason, we're going to try and make water-proof cards (and make zillions, of course). =D

I didn't go to set building, haha.  I was sooo tired when I got home on Saturday night, and I also left Oshkosh a little later than I had expected.  The drive home made me even more tired, despite the steamer I stopped and got from Kwik Trip (not very impressive, haha).  

Now I'm even a little more stuck.  I sent in my $100 to UW-Madison just to reserve my spot, and I have to send in my housing soon too.  However, I really do like the Oshkosh campus.  It's nice down there, and it's much smaller than Madison, of course.  I'm also going to have a lot of good friends there next year....  This really is one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make.  

THANK GOD FOR THREE-DAY WEEKS <- Just had to get that out...

Oh yeah, after the S2D concert, I talked to every member from the band.  That was awesome.  I think they're pretty impressed (or maybe creeped out) that I'm following them all over Wisconsin, haha.  I got a free pin too since they ran out at the Platteville show. I bought a shirt too. The Platteville one was just a little bit better than the Oshkosh one just because they had a much bigger space to play, and the vocals there were much better than at Oshkosh.  But then again, at P-ville they were playing in a really big room, whereas in Oshkosh, they played in a small coffee house (it's a nice one, I'd like to check it out sometime when there's no bands there and such.).  They even played When I'm Stuck, I Turn To Duck Tape.  It was awesome :D  It was pretty crazy and HOT in there.

I'm so tired, and I know I don't have much, so tonight is going to be an early night (if Mrs. Walker posts any important information on the website, I will be MAD!!)  I'm so happy that tomorrow is Friday.  I need a weekend.  I've been feeling very irratable and bitchy lately, and I just need a weekend away from some people from school...some, not all.  This is one of the first weekends in a long time that I'll actually get to spend with my family because I don't work anymore.  Perhaps this is not a good thing... I really have nothing planned for this weekend, I'm going to take it easy.  I am going to catch up on some reading and notes for school, but that's about it.  

Hmm, McDonoughs worked my ass (or left leg) off again today.  It was cool though because Tom wasn't there, so I mainly worked with John, and he's awesome.  He actually stays by you while you do the exercises and talks to you.  He knows a lot of Nekoosa people since he's the trainer that comes to school, so we talked about all the people he knows, mwahaha.

So yeah. I have received all of my letters back from colleges, and thankfully they were all acceptence letters.  Now, between Point, Madison, and Oshkosh, I need to decide where I will venture off to next Fall.  Despite what Mr. Rokser told me today, that it should be no decision since I got into Madison, it is a big decision for me.  Do I want to go to Point for a year or two to get a little more one on one help and be closer to home?  Do I want to go to Oshkosh who really wants me for their honors program (which is nice, and they even called me today)?  Or, do I want the big kahuna?  Madison would be great, but I just don't know how well I'd handle it.  However, I will have friends there when I go, so that will make it a bit more comfortable (as long as they don't forget about me :( haha).  Ahh...

I would have to say that this was one of the better homecomings.  I spent a total of 10 minutes with my date, and hung out with my friends the whole time.  It was great.  Jason and Jamie came over afterwards and we watched a movie and just sat around...and Jason left his wallet here so he had to pick it up at like, 9 in the morning, haha. 

But, of course, it's back to normal mode at school.  I will miss spirit week this year though.

We lost our game tonight (of course:)) A lot of people were there.  A lot of people were home from college.  Chris and George came up, and then Coyer and Jason....so, in other words, I got to see friends that I don't see that much, haha.

I havn't heard back from any collegest yet. Grr. When I applied to Madtown, I got the e-mail thing with my code where I can check out the status of my application, but now the code isn't working anymore, and it is making me mad.  I'm really in suspense.

I had my third physical therapy session today.  My left leg feels like it's going to fall off.  I feel like I'm going to die when my therapist guy puts the weight on my ankle and makes me do the leg lifts.  Heavy! haha.  I'm just weak.  After a month of this therapy, however, my left leg is definately not going to be weak anymore.  It's nice though because they have really nice stuff there, and I've been getting pretty decent workouts there.  It forces me to not be lazy, which I'm going to stop doing anyways :)  There is this really good looking guy that has been there just working out for the last couple times I've been there.  I hope he continues to go, because he is nice to look at.

Not much has happened...at all.  Today was sort of crappy just because it was an ordinary old day.  I had to go to physical therapy again.  That sucked.  My left leg is about to fall off.

Yesterday, on the other hand, was fun though.  Zach, Laurel and I went to town after school.  We went to Quiznos, Walmart, then Goodwill.  I got half of my 80s costume at goodwill, and I found a boyscouts shirt there that I like...I just need to have my grandma reinforce the buttons a bit, because they are kind of loose.  It's nifty.  

I have all my college applications done now, but I might have mentioned that earlier...but then again, it has been a long time since I've updated.  I applied at MAdison, Point, and Oshkosh.  If I don't get into Madison though, I'll almost for sure go to Point.  I guess my cousin got accepted there.  I know she wants me to go there for my first year or two, but I guess I can't really base my decision on that...

I have to get most of my OChem assignment done tonight and I don't waaaannnnt to work on it.  I'm so tired.  I woke up extra early to go to Zach's to help him with his costume.  And tomorrow is the parade and pep rally, so I won't have time to get it turned in tomorrow.  Gah...  but I am very veyr thankful that Mrs Benbow moved our calc quiz to Monday, haha.  But of course...physics, sociology and world lit tests tomorrow. Bah..

I think I'm mildly obsessed with the new The Used cd.  I listen to it ALL the time.  I tried to go a day listening to something else, but it doesn't work.  I broke down and just stuck it in my cd player.  I love their last cd...this one is a million bazillion times better.

One thing that is coming to mind today.  I hate people who say how much they (still) want to be your friend, yet they always act like they are better than you.  It's annoying.  Maybe one day you'll feel bad for making me feel like that, but then again, you probably won't.  In which case, I have one word...whateva.  
Let's not take our friends for granted anymore.  For if you do, they probably won't be around forever.  My words of wisdom for today. 

I've come to the conclusion that it is necessary for me to go to sleep around 11 on school nights.  Last night, I went to bed around 10, and I was dragging my feet all day.  When I go to bed earlier, I have an easier time waking up and I don't feel so tired throughout the day.  Take this as advice, if you will.  I'm feeling philosophical (that's the word, right?) today, and I'm not sure why.

I got my dress.  I think it's pretty. Not uber fancy or anything, just black and white.  They had a size too small, and a size too big...so I got the bigger one, and I have to have my grandma do some alterations on it.  Zach helped me pick it out, so at least I'm not the only person who thinks it's a cool looking dress.

I got my personal statement written for my applications finally.  I believe I'm going to get some proof reading done, and hopefully send a few out tomorrow night.  I still need to think of a third college to apply to...

Oh, yes, my knee problem is worsening.  Now I have this terrible pain all the way down the left side of my left leg.  My ankle even hurts a little bit.  So we decided today that it's time for me to see a doctor, which is a fine idea, I must say.

Now, I have a organic chem test to study for all night tonight...that is, after I go to the trails at umm...4:30ish to see if that fine looking piece of work I saw there the other day is there again today.

I hate really dumb people, I really do.  They upset me, but they do usually bring a smile to my face.  Just remember that I'm not smiling with you, because inside, I'm laughing as hard as humanly possible.  And that's all I have to say on that subject for today.

Tomorrow after school, Zach and I are going to Wausau to go dress shopping for me.  It's really one of the only chances I have to do it.  And, I guess I'm still going, because I guess Chase still wants to go...it had been 3 or so months since he asked me and since I've even heard anything of the subject.  Whatever. I know how it's going to go already.  I mean, Chase is a nice guy, and I don't mind going with him at all...but what common ground do we have?  We never talk outside of school now that summer is done...and even in summer, I just saw him periodically at Kitchen.  Soo....I guess I'll be going out to eat with a bunch of people I really, for the most part, can't call my friends....we'll go to the dance, and probably not see eachother until 11 or 12...whenever it ends.

I'm bored.  I tried making two t shirts today with transfer, and I messed both of them up royally, so I am washing the other 3 so I can try again. Sooo...I'm going to have to buy a new pack because those ones were mine and Zach's.

La de da de da. I'm waiting for my friends to get back so we can go to Platteville. I'm bored.  I think I'm going to run to town and then come home and do some homework. Hmm, sounds like a good plan."

"event","Ok, well, school was retarded today.  I have no reason for this really, but it just was.  I was glad to be done with it at the end of the day, although I did not get all the stuff done that I wanted to after school...as in my homework....

Zach, Laurel and I went to Taco Johns and then Walmart.  Taco Johns was fun because we took the united way donation word finds/donation placemats, and we put sour cream, taco sauce, and potato oles (among many other food items...) alll over it, folded it up, and intended on sending it to the united way as our donation.  Laurel and I have good reasoning for this, as we are soo very sick about hearing about the damn united way at work...and constantly being hounded about upping our donations. Grr. 

So after we stopped at walmart (which followed taco johns), I went home, took the kids to the trails in the woods, and was out there for a little over an hour.  We covered some good ground...  Then I came home, and dallas called and said him and sam were going to the coffee house...so I went there.  And then, umm, I went out to zach's...and Ryan did not show up, lol.  Soo, now I am home, and that was my day.  I'm thinking I should get some homework done tonight, but I'm really tired, and it's already almost 1.  I am not very good at the whole time management thing.  I also need to get my applications done, for the most part, this weekend.  And then tomorrow, it's down to Platteville until Sunday sometime. Yeah, I'm really bad at the time management...oh well, haha.

That concludes this entery."

Well, I'm getting ready to send my applications out, finally.  I got my 3 letters of recommendation now, and I have to go up and talk to Miss Currier tomorrow to have her help me with my applicant statement....so hopefully I can get most of it done tomorrow night.  Bah, I also have to get most of my homework done tomorrow night too since I'm not going to be home for part of the weekend..and I don't want to just put it off until Sunday night, as usual :)

Hmm...what else...well, nothing really.  Still can't wait to see S2D on Saturday, and I'm hoping that we won't MISS THEM since dallas has his cross country meet in wausau that afternoon.  Oh well...p-ville is a long, boring drive on a 2 lane road...so basically, you can go whatever speed you want :)

I have to do my college applications this weekend.  I'm nervous, haha.  At least once I send them out, I won't have to concern myself with it until winterish.

Um, well, today was just like...any ordinary school day. Homework is little tonight, suprisingly enough.  I stayed after school for a half hour or so and Mrs. Brost helped me with my O Chem, so now, if we DO have this supposed pop quiz tomorrow, I think I'll be prepared, haha.  Ugh..calculus and physics quiz monday.

Ok, I've come to the conclusion that I think something is wrong with my knee.  It pops all the time and it hurts when there's a lot of pressure on it, and it just feels...out of place, or something.  Just thought I'd throw this in...

Next weekend sounds like it's going to be pretty cool.  Something to Do will, I'm sure, put on another kick ass show.  I want to bring my cd case and have them sign it, haha.  They rock my socks off. It's going to be a crammed dorm room though..haha.

Tonight was fun...Jamie, Zach, and I went to Culvers about 10 minutes before they close. Then Zach and I did our homework at my house, and looked up possibilities for t-shirts.  Not much was accomplished, except for the homework, which was nice.

Now I'm tired, and bored, and SOMEONE ISN'T RESPONDING TO ME ON YAHOO, jerk. 

I still have MORE homework to get done tomorrow, and I work alll damn day.  I think I will just get some done on my hour break.  Whatever.

I think my favorite class this year is going to be sociology, haha. AND NO, NOT BECAUSE OF THAT. It's just fun...except for the jerk guy.  We played Mr. Schider's old current events game today. That was pretty cool.  I have lot's of calc stuff and o-chem stuff to work on though. I am actually quite proud because I did a good chunk of my homework for the weekend tonight.  Staying ahead of the game this year.  

I think Zach and I are going to Wausau tomorrow to see Ryan...and maybe that Eric character I hear so much about..haha.  However, he is not responding to my messages, and I wish he would, so I know what's going on tomorrow. Men...   :)

Tonight was cool though, for being a night at Kitchen.  Dallas, Sam, Jeff, and me just kind of sat and talked.  It seems weird now that we're all in school again though, haha.  Oh well.

I decided to run for student council again.  I haven't done that since I was on it in 8th grade.  As I've told people though, I'm not campaigning myself in the least (VOTE FOR ME, DAMNIT)<- Just kidding, really.  Just thought I'd stick my name in for the fun of it, kind of at the last minute too.  I got my last two signatures after the bell rang today (it was due today).

"event","I think I will start each entery from now on with a word of the day, taken directly from our AWESOME assignment notebooks/hippi workbooks.  Haha.  Mr. Kumm = Mr. Feeny, I tell you. 

Well, first day of my senior year, almost hard to believe.  In roughly 180 days, I'm going to be graduating.  Within a week or two, I'm going to have my college applications sent in.  Hopefully by the time I get some responses, I'll have a little better idea of where I want to go and what I want to do.  Madison seems like the best choice, but who knows what's going to happen from now until then.  What's funny is that the guidance councelors at school seem to be talking me out of it.  At least that's the vibe I get.

So anyways, O-Chem and AP Calc are going to be the killers this year.  Ah, oh well.  I'll pull through.  Sociology...ah soc...two words come to mind: eye candy.  JAMIE, who'd have thought...we'd have him for a teacher one day, hahaha.  I would trade some people for others in some of my classes, but I have at least a few of my close friends in every one of my classes, so I guess that works for me.  

After school, Zach and I went out to lunch at Culvers.  The music there seems to just take you away, and it makes you want to dance, haha.  I also recommend pretending you have invisible children with you when you eat in public.  Hilarity will ensue.  After that, I came home, did my work out, went out in the hot tub, and now I'm here waiting to embark on my first night of high school homework.  But hey, at least it's my LAST first night of high school homework :) Mwaha.

It's been a long time since I've updated.  Umm...I havn't done much.  The Robinson PArk concert thing was last weekend.  Pretty good bands there.  It was cool, I talked to the singer from Zero to Sixty Never a couple days after the show, and he said he remembered seeing me there.  But, he probably says that to anyone who was at one of their shows, haha.  Oh well.  Oh yeah, and then there was BOB...everytime I think about that, I laugh.  So Courtney brought these two guys with her from somewhere by Wausau...one of them is one of her man friends, or something, and the other was Bob.  Well, I guess Bob wanted to meet me or something, and I wasn't THAT interested (mainly because I was scared, and I thought surely he was blind/retarded), so Summer and Courtney insisted that I go up to him and say ""hi."" They dragged me off the metal bench.  Result? A HUGE bruise on my leg.  Haha.  And the funny part is, he really didn't seem to have that much interest...but then again, Courtney and Summer were pretty much throwing me on top of him and forcing us to shake hands, so that's not a fun thing for anyone, haha.  Whatever, haha.  Just a funny story.  And when I say that bruise is huge, I mean it. 

Well...time to get some dinner, and then start some homework.  Maybe now that school has started, I'll have some more somewhat interesting posts for my regular readers, which are few and far between, haha. That's ok :)"

I went to Jamie's last night and we watched a couple movies, Godsend and How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days.  Both were good, but now I'm convinced that we are being stalked by Zachary (from Godsend).  Jamie even said she had nightmares about the movie, haha loser.  

I'm sorry Zach for not attending the party, but alcohol sounds like the most not appealing thing in the world after suffering the most excruciating hangover of all time, lol.  I'm sorry :(

We got our new hot tub on Friday..it's nice, haha.  You can actually hear yourself and others talk while you're in it.  That's where I just was, in fact :)

I caught Bill as I was about to leave and go to kitchen and asked him if I could see what merchandise they have.  He's so unbelievably gorgeous, haha. So Ike sold me a shirt, and said I have a beautiful name, and also told me that since all they had was larges in shirts, I could sleep in it and be with them all night, and Bill told me to drive careful. Bam. Haha, I'm such a goon.  I guess I have to admit that Chris's band was far better than I had thought they were going to be, in fact, I was quite impressed.  

Work was so horrible today.  The biggest sales seem to bring in the bitchiest customers who think their way is the right way, and of course they go and complain when we tell them differently.  So of course, the managers let them have it their way, and make us look like the idiots.  Stupid, stupid people.

This has been a relaxing past few days.  Sort of.  Wednesday was of course fun...minus the puking.  It's nice to kind of do that once in a while and just kind of forget the stupid things that are bringing you down, haha.  Thursday was a relaxing sleep-off-hangover day.  Today was fun going to the show and then to kitchen.  Tomorrow is a crappy work-filled day again though, oh well.

I might have people to go to Platteville with now.  I requested off for that Something To Do concert, and I figured I would beg chris to let me stay with him a night...and then I figured he wouldn't because, well, he doesn't like me all too much.  But maybe he will if other people are with, haha.  I realllllllllllllllly want to see something to do again. ugh.

One more year until UW-Madison.  Thank the Lord.

My mom does not know at this particular moment that they are all here...but I'm sure she won't care. 

I've kind of been feeling crappy today though.  I wish people didn't blatently lie to me.  Oh well.  Zak is back around, and he's always wonderful to talk to about my problems....he always has some words of encouragement (they do work!).

I hate being bored all day, among so many other things.  I don't want to go to this stupid stupid meeting at work tomorrow.  My stomach feels like it's going to...I don't know...die.  Rougly ten more months until I never have to put up with crappy high school again. That makes me happy.

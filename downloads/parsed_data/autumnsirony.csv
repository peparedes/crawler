i feel like ive wasted so much time
and now i dont have any.

no control.
nor focus.

emotions are rampant.
happiness is clouded
by the chaos
of all other feelings.

CONFUSION
drains my mind
as exhaust overwhelms.

my fears of failure returning.
and a lack of creativity
dwindles all hope.

everything has run dry.
except the tears i cry.
hopelessly.


no need to worry.
for this is not 
permanent.

temporarily
I AM

p.s. this sucks. and this i know. anything with regards to thinking, writing, drawing, and/or using my brain is off kilter tonight. nothing wants to function properly, therefore, my writing which sucks anyways, is completely a piece of shit now. i apologize for you having read this."

chocholate on the outside,
chocholate on the inside.
i always feel like a little kid eating one.


on another note:
writing essays takes a lot out of you.
even more so when you feel like your best
will never be good enough.

i find it quite ironic to write about perfection.
so fitting for my life.
for my struggles.
i guess keeping it impersonal
was just another way to avoid 
any un-needed attention.
but it's impersonality was a hindrance to my ideas.
no way to say what i wanted
without giving so much away.


maybe i'll give in again.
do things ""my"" way."

"event","Everyday is a new chance to figure it out.

Haven't quite got there yet.
But why should I expect that of myself?

Time is on my side. At least for a few minutes.

Sometimes it scares me to say ""FUCK IT!"" 
to everyone elses' opinions.
It's hard to trust myself sometimes.
To trust my mind.
To trust my heart.

But I'm taking a chance on myself.
""Call me a safe bet, I'm betting I'm not.""
If I'm wrong, laugh in my face.
I'd rather not give in to your judgement.
Let me make my own mistakes.

I owe some the benefit of the doubt.
And others are debtors to my name.
Do I get the benefits?  No.
But when has that stopped me?

I come to my own conclusions.
Think what you want of me, 
but I won't think what you want me to.
Not this time.
I'd give you a break, 
but you're not deserving.
Try to taint my mind;
I'm already contaminated.

This is my adventure. 
My chance.
To figure me out.
To figure him out.
And to say, FUCK YOU."

"event","I was frustrated, and I have no right to blame anything on anyone but myself.
It's been a very unusual experience for me these past 2 days.
And I find it somewhat funny how quickly one can change to meet their own needs. 

Thursday was out-right the most horrible day ever. 
I felt abandoned, alone, and I blew-off so many people. 
It was like no sooner than everyone left did I build a wall, 
the tallest one I could make. 
And I hid from everything that was going on, 
almost as if I knew I wouldn't even try to make an effort to adjust or do something about it.

But Friday was a little different. 
It started out, shitty as ever. 
But only because I didn't do anything about it. 
I could have made it better, 
I know, but I didn't. 
Homeroom was the same way...
with no one there, 
instead of finding someone else to talk to, 
I just didn't talk. 
I avoided the situations rather than doing something about them.

But as the day went on, 
I found people to talk to, 
not anyone I was particularly close to, 
but people I'd had classes with before, 
or seen around school and at least knew their names. 

It might of just been small talk to them, but to me, 
it was kind of reassuring that I can make it in the world, 
I just have to stop being afraid. 

It really taught me that I'm the only one 
holding me back when it comes down to those situations.
That no matter what I do the rest of my life, 
or where I go, 
those situations will come up.
I can't just run-away from them; 
I can't runaway from my life anymore.

It made me realize a lot of things about myself,
and helped me to extinguish the fires of fear burning in my mind.


I'm hoping now, 
that because of this experience, 
when I go on retreat, 
I'll be better able to face my fears 
to really get the most out of it, 
rather than hiding behind my wall, 
and leaving myself unprepared for 
the rest of my life."

It's funny how things work that way.
But I guess that's what life is about.
Getting a chance each day 
to make it better than the day before.

I'm not much for focus right now.
Everything is beginning to blur.
Tonight was simply amazing.
And if not for my second family, 
I don't know where I'd be.

Next year will be an adventure.
A struggle, beyond belief.
But I'm up for a challenge.
And I feel well prepared.


As for tomorrow, I'll be at the show.
The stressfulness of this week has passed.
And the onset of the weekend brings hope of relaxation.
But the time has come for me to internalize these hopes,
And sleep solemnly.

I wish peace and harmony to all.
Good luck to those in the show.
My lovelies, sleep sweet.

"event","I'd like to apologize now for everyone I blew off today.
It's inevitable that this week pass with agony.
And that nothing seems to have any hope of getting better.

The first ending began today.
But with an end brings a new beginning of much greater things.
Feeling like a failure is no way to end things.
Disappointment and guilt clouds my view from how amazing it was.
Nothing can ever amount to what our team was.
Their spirit will live on with the team.
Forever it will exist in our memories. 
The end just seems too short-lived.
A precursor for what is to come.
The END.

Or rather, another new beginning.
The beginning of a time where the realization of life strikes me so.
And nothing is ever the same after.
A realization that I can't go back.
I can't retrace my steps and replace them with less worry, 
or embrace the times I never thought I'd miss.
I never thought about this day coming.
Nor this day ending.
But one day, chance might have it that I'll look back, 
and wish I'd put it to better use.
Rather than keeping to myself.
And sharing nothing but frowns,
and complaints, and tears.

Living for the moments.
The one's you'll never expect to have,
The one's you'll never expect to miss,
The one's you'll always wish you had.

Every day you waste is another chance you'll miss something you could have had.

It's only a matter of time before everything must end.
But it's what you do until then that matters the most."

Maybe it's been a blessing, maybe a hindrance.
All I know is this is a new start.
Much like the one I began giving myself this year.

Now I don't expect anyone to follow this.
Nor look forward to reading what I have to say.
I may write here daily, or hardly at all.
I just found it necessary to give myself an outlet if ever I had anything to say. 
So enjoy the ride. 
I've found it to be worth while.

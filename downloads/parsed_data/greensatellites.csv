"event","So the other day I was talking about how a single phrase can make your day, well it definitely happened today!!!!!! When Alyshia said her graduation was going to be the weekend that I am down in FL this summer I thought I was going to die. I wanted to like scream/laugh/ and cry all at the same time. But Lysh Pysh you do not know how happy I am that I get to see you go across the stage and scream my head off for you!!!! I was going to be so sad to not be able to see this amazing moment in your life. But I am!!!!! 

And then today haha, everyone needs to be able to laugh at themselves, and I definitely do it almost everyday. But today I was talking to Chloe and I siad how sad I was because I hadnt seen ""hair"" all day and then we got out of English extremely early today (which I definitely think was meant to be lol I am such a nerd) and I saw him and he smiled at me!!!!!! It definitely increased my bad mood at the moment. I love it. But I definitely hope I get to talk to him soon. 

But life is good at the moment. Well actually not. Its bearable but two of my friends are not doing so well and I feel so terrible because I feel like I cant do anything to help them. That is my goal today, to talk to them and hopefully help them feel better. OH man."

"event","So today I was thinking about how sad I am about graduation coming up and everybody leaving and how I dont want to have to work all summer and not see everyone every day. I mean I think I am going to be soooo depressed for a long time. But I do believe everything happens for a reason and everything will work out like it should. Maybe not exactly how I want it to happen but needless to say it will be for the best. Not everyone who I love will always be near me to the point where I see them every day yet our relationship is still strong, so from now on I am going to try my best to just let things happen without trying to understand every detail of the actions and contents. I will do like the Beatles song and ""Let it Be"". But oh how I want certain things to happen and I will be sad if they dont. Ugh I feel like such a hypocrite sometimes. But I guess I am just human. I say one thing and do another. But hey I guess it is easier said than done. No matter what I say God, I know you are there guiding me. Could there quite possible be any love showers for me in the near future though?

OH so I got my first C on a test today!!! I dont know how I feel about that. :~0"

"event","It is amazing how one person or one phrase can just make your day. Change a sad, gloomy day into a bright and warm day. I love all the little things in life. I think people take those for granted most of the time. And recently that is what I have been trying to notice and cherish. So many things can affect your day: a simple gust of wind, a smile, a certain someone eating lunch with you, being grazed against the arm by a friend, a hug, the sun coming out from behind a cloud, having someone run to open the door for you, listening to an old favorite song, standing in the rain, eating a warm chocolate chip cookie, laughing so hard you cant breathe while running up the stairs with your suite mate trying to beat the teacher to the classroom, getting a compliment, sitting alone on a swing in the sun, sitting with soimeone you care about on a swing in the sun, and dancing, not caring who the heck is watching. I mean come on those are amazing things and I just want to cry/ laugh/ smile whenever one of these things come about.
 I wish I could better express my feelings. I mean lately I have been feeling things I have never felt before and I just dont know how to describe them or write them down or how to really even think about them. I mean whenever I go to Camp Summit, I just want to throw my head back and spin in the middle of the field and smile/ laugh. I mean I have no idea why, I just get this overwhelming feeling of happiness and peace whenever I am there. I love it. I want to work there this summer so bad but I will definitely go there as much as I can to volunteer. All the people there are so awesome and it just makes my heart melt. It seriously has made me tihnk extremely hard about what I want to do with my life. I really think the Docotrs without Borders is wonderful and then I heard about how a small town would pay for your medical school if you would work in their town for a certain amount of time. I mean why not. I am going into medicine to help people who are in need. And then there are those free clinics who need all the help they can get and then there are places like Camp Summit. If I were rich or even had some money I would give them all I had. And then I also want to be in love so bad. I know I know. My time will come and there is the perfect person out there waiting for me. But I mean I know someone who when he walks into the room I start to smile and the whole room seems to brighten. Is it wrong of me to want something more from this situation/ relationship. I want to know what all these people are feeling when they have someone to hold and love them and care for them and kiss them and just look at them with that look in their eyes. I want that. And I dont think that is too much to ask for. I just wish I were brave enough to make a move to make this happen. So I guess technically it is my fault. But he is leaving soon and I am running out of time and I dont know if I have it in me to gather up the strength and courage to say something. Ahhhhh pray for me and wich me luck. God I need your help here. Please give me courage. I guess it will work out if it is supposed to. Oh how I wish it were though."

"event","So I am officially brain dead! I dont know how I did on my tests today. I think it will be a miracle though if I get an A on my Cal test, but I really really need one. I guess I just have to shush the perfectionist in me and tell her a B is great. Because well I guess it really is. But I have been so much happier lately! I think it is the weather. Its such an awesome temperature out and I love being outside and I get to wear all my spring clothes and then all my new clothes. 

And I am becoming one with myself I think and it makes me feel good. I am perfect and just the way I should be. Think Lovely Thoughts is todays saying. Everyone should use it. You dont know how much bad thoughts affect your mood and then how you feel about people and especially yourself. So make the world happier and smile and then when the pessimist inside of us all starts scratching to the surface wash it away with a nice big glass of bubbling personality.

Alyshia comes in 6 DAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I cant wait to see her. She is going to just brighten up my week. I can feel it."

"event","Ahhh. So I had the most perfect dream last night, where everything went smoothly and perfectly and exactly how I want to do it everytime I see him. Ugh and I am freaking almost over him and then I had to go have a dream like this and it just makes me want him all over again. Ok so here is how it went:  We are sitting at a table with some friends doing kareoke haha I know random right. And then it was my turn to go and so I went to grab the mic from him and I guess he wasnt done so after I was holding it he grabbed the mic and had his hand over mine. When the song ended he just never let go and as everyone else was leaving the place we just stood there looking into eachothers' eyes. It felt so real! And then he held me for awhile and kissed my forehead really gently and we walked out into the hall (he was still holding my hand of course!!!!!) And then he hugged me goodbye except it was more of a holding me goodbye again lol and then kissed me again on the forehead. OMG it was amazing. And then I ran and started screaming with Ams and it was great and we were just freaking out. Oh what I would give to have that actually happen! :-/ HAHA for you guys who dont know the deal with this guy, I have had a serious crush on this kid and I bought him in a date auction lol for the Valentines Dance (I know something I would never do unlesss I was crazy and well frankly I think I reached insanity when i met this kid lol) but anyways the update on us is that I am now too shy to talk to him and he meets my eyes occasionally. I dont know if we dont talk because he is so shy or if he just doesnt like me! But anyways it was just a great dream last night, I needed to write it down so I could remember it."

"event","So I havent wrote anything in here in like forever. I was wondering if writing in here would maybe help me figure out some of the things I have been confused about! But I doubt it. Things have been so crazy lately. Granted my huge problem for like the past 6 months seems to be calming down gradually, but it is still a daily struggle and I am freaking tired not being happy with myself and just want to have my feelings dealt with and then be left with bliss. But huh that is like asking to be reincarnated into buddha or something that extraordinary. My problems are what are holding me back but yet dealing with them will only bring turmoil and frankly I am not really up for the task of handling that. 
 
  I wish I just lived in a world with ""bright and sunshiny days"", a stereo system with music galore and it know exactly what to play to ease my troubled mind, and then of course that one and only, makes my heart melt, takes my breath away man that is supposed to be my soul mate and who has yet to make himself shown to me, showering me with his love all day long. I mean is that too much to ask for? A place where I can be myself, and not have to deal with the shit that makes up my life! Apparently it is. Fine. Whatever. I dont care anymore. 
  
  Lysh is coming soon and I just want to run away with her and live out on the street for awhile. Get away from all these people not happy with my choices, answers, feelings, understandings, or frankly the way I seem to be. But forget this prom crap and being single and lonely!! Pah that is me spitting on love. All it seems to do is bite me in the butt. So we girls are going to celebrate girlness by being ourselves and enjoying our time together without annoying sucky boys in our way. I am so excited ladies. Hope tomorrow is brighter in the world of Rachel! I have a feeling it just might be. But that is only the optimistic side of me choking the larger pessimistic side. It wont last long. Goodnight."

  where does it go? I cant even remeber sitting here doing homework for an hour and a half. My dear Dani, sorry I didnt call you back today I thought I would have time to hangout but apparently not! I didnt realize all the things I needed to do. But I am coming back next weekend for Halloween and I will definetely see you then. 

I find I am becoming tired of being a wallflower in the way I think. I participate and all that crap but when it comes time to sleep I become an insomniac with all the days and weeks past events flooding into my already full and tired brain. I analyze everything from sounds, movements, and glances to conversations. I notice everything about people and sometimes it overwhelms me and I just want to stop and be happy. Not worry about why someone did something, or looked a certain way, or said something!!!! But Ill never be able to stop because that is me deep down I am a wallflower!

Some times I am really happy and then others I am just calm I guess is the best word for it. I loved coming back home this weekend and seeing MR and Dani. Dani you inspire me!!! And it meant a lot to me that you really wanted to know my opinion about the thing. You made my day, I love you bebe. duder. And MR you just made me so happy, I love haningout with you. Then I come back and it is kind of weird because it is starting to feel like home and it felt weird sleeping without my roommate in the room. And I had only one class today so I did all my homework and that made me happy and I went to the gym but then I remembered that tomorrow I will just be behind again from all the new homework and I know all of you are in the same boat as I am so I am not going for a pity party for Rachel or anything but it ruined my high and then I realized I pulled a muscle at the gym!! But hey what can you do and Brandon called me tonight and last night and Saturday night hahah but we are just friends now which is sad but better than nothing and he is telling me to be a contender not a pretender or something like that!! But hey got to go to Bible Study love you all life is friggin' sweet!

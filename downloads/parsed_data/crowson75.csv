"event","Everytime my boss is a wanker, I want to tell him to shove his job up his arse. Is that pretty much how everyone feels?&nbsp;

I think I am now too old to want to work for other people. I feel like I&#39;ve seen all the machinations of arrogance and ego - especially male - and it&#39;s all just utter bollocks.&nbsp;

I wanted to have a conversation with my boss on Friday. It was snowing, and, yes, I know the UK is a bit shit at dealing with snow, but we don&#39;t have the infrastructure to cope. And, therefore, you do have to be aware of it more than, say, someone in Canada or&nbsp;Scandinavia&nbsp;where they expect it and just get on. The UK hasn&#39;t had a lot of snow, historically. This is new and we&#39;ve just not got set up for it. We will have to, but we ain&#39;t there yet.&nbsp;

So on Friday the boss decided it would be a brilliant idea to drag us all to London to the RSA (boss booked the room for a client we never got...) for a day of team building and communication and bullshit. Funnily enough, arguing and discussion was mentioned and it was decided with the group that we could have heated debates - even rows - as long as we were willing to do so and didn&#39;t get personal.

On Friday the weather in our area was essentially shit, but we all went. Halfway through the day it became clear that the roads were getting bad and the general prognosis for the day was getting worse. Since most of us were travelling by minibus, this was important. I spoke to the office manager and she told me to talk to the big boss as he was essentially insisting we all stayed. So I spoke to him and he told me that if there was 3&quot; of snow on the ground at lunch, there would still be 3&quot; of snow at the end of the day. So I mentioned that if it continued to snow, there would in fact be 5&quot; or 6&quot; of snow later. He pulled a face. So I mentioned that relatives were worried and that it was going to be hard for everyone to give their all to discussions if they were all worried about getting home. People at home - where the weather was worse - were worried that the roads were becoming too dangerous and that action needed to be taken. To which he replied that people being worried about you was a good thing so what was my point..? Now is it me or is that not discussing, but just blocking? &nbsp; It&#39;s being a tosser, essentially.&nbsp;

I knew then that he - who had promised to travel back to MK with us that evening to ensure people could get home safely or be put up in a hotel, if not - wasn&#39;t going to be travelling back with us. For the afternoon session I was all red-eyed because I was so angry I cried (which I hate - why does this happen? It&#39;s really annoying!) and just wasn&#39;t in the mood to hear his speech about how much he cared about his staff and wanted to invest in us. To be honest, it was so obviously bullshit after our discussion that I turned off. &nbsp;And, quelle surprise, when the bus driver called and announced he was on his way 30 minutes later because if he didn&#39;t, we wouldn&#39;t get back, boss announced he was going back by train... Wanker.&nbsp;

I&#39;ve been furious all weekend and just want to tell him to shove his job up his backside. I can&#39;t afford to do that, but I really want to. I think the man&#39;s an egotistical, bullshitting wanker who wanted his day out and no one was going to stop him so ne-ne-ne-ne-neeh. Twat."

An age when things weren&#39;t better, they were just better hidden and, perhaps, more widely accepted. And, to some extent, the same is true of Moore.

"event","<p>There was a programme on telly earlier in the week called &#39;999: What&#39;s Your Emergency?&#39;&nbsp; It replayed calls from members of the public being instructed by emergency call operators how to perform CPR on their loved ones. It hit a nerve.

Going back to the later summer and autumn of 2010 and I was in love.</p>
<lj-cut>
<p>Head over heels, Nic, who had been my friend for a year, told me she loved me too. She&#39;d split from her wife&nbsp; and, with no where else to go, moved in with me. A week later and she was in hospital. A beating from the ex and a quad bike accident had flared up a kidney problem and she was in continuous, chronic pain. Her kidneys were failing and her condition didn&#39;t seem to be improving. The hospital told us nothing. They left me to do the nursing, pretty much. I chased nurses for her meds, changed catheters, emptied catheter bags, bathed her... The only thing I couldn&#39;t do was protect her 24/7. Her ex wife attacked her in the ward twice. The doctors, who didn&#39;t know what to do about Nic&#39;s pain, dithered. I even emailed the hospital office when they ran out of morphine and tried to chase the medication through. I felt like i had the weight of work, the hospital and my family on my shoulders. Nic was living on painkillers, not sleeping or eating, afraid and desperate. Finally, she was let out when the hospital finally admitted she would be better at home. But the painkillers continued and, not much later, they began to have consequences.

Nic&#39;s body -we found out later - was registering those pills as poison. She was collapsing with anaphylaxis on a weekly basis, having allergic reactions to seemingly everything. I learned how to make semi-conscious people swallow antihistamines. I learnt how to use an epi pen and, for the first time, I learned to call 999. The attacks were terrifying. Nic would sometimes refuse to accept that she was having them and not take the medication she needed.&nbsp; I would watch her lips turn blue as she argued, lapsing in and out of consciousness but never for long enough to give her the adrenalin shot she needed. I would wait until she accepted or fell into deep unconsciousness and dial that number, jabbing her epi pen in her thigh whilst holding the receiver under my chin.

After one attack, Nic told me we were over and not to follow the ambulance to hospital. I ignored her and went anyway. We had a quiet, resuscitation room row whilst a man in the next bed lay dying. And finally, the adrenalin wore off and the tears came, as did the acceptance that Nic just hated the fact that we seemed to be attached to that damn hospital by bungy cord. On another occasion we arrived and were greeted with, &#39;I don&#39;t know why the ambulance brought you here, we haven&#39;t got any adrenalin.&#39; We giggled when I had to use the epi pen in my handbag, alone in a cubicle whilst the A&amp;E staff talked about Eastenders. I popped my head around the curtain and announced, &#39;I&#39;ve deployed the epi pen,&#39; a statement that made Nic laugh through swollen throat, tongue and lips. But those events were mere chattel next to the time when me and my dad had to bring her back to life.

The anaphylaxis bouts were getting worse and, eventually, a &#39;normal&#39; attack stopped her heart. I&#39;d been rubbing her chest whilst my dad talked to the emergency operator as it seemed to help her breathe.&nbsp; She wouldn&#39;t rouse and her breathing stopped. That voice on the phone is the only help you have. The rest was down to me and my dad. I started the chest compressions, but was too tentative. Dad took over whilst I gave her mouth to mouth. I remember being freezing. The hairs on the back of my neck felt like they were electric wires, jabbing my nerve endings with little blue shocks. It seemed like ages when I felt and heard her take a breath and a cough. And another. By the time the first responder arrived, Nic was back.&nbsp; I drove to hospital behind that bloody ambulance and cried. I pulled into the car park, parking with shaking hands, tears dripping off my chin whilst I told myself in a stern voice to pull myself together. It took seeing Nic in resus, looking pale but alive, to calm the fear in the bottom of my stomach and back of my throat.

I&#39;d felt that fear for a while after. Nic and I both had glandular fever and I got IBS from that evil churning anxiety. It even came back for a bit this year, when I started getting panic attacks out of the blue. In a way, I learned a little bit of how Nic felt, gasping for air whilst your body freaks out.&nbsp; I&#39;m ashamed to admit that it sometimes hijacks me when Nic and I argue, which we don&#39;t very much.&nbsp; It has a little niggle when Nic&#39;s poorly and little patch on her lip goes a bit blue to scare me. And, for a minute, that programme brought it back.&nbsp;</p>

"event","<p>So, in the world of me lately I have finished my degree course. It&#39;s an odd feeling. I have spent six years knowing that each year, without fail, I would have to write half a dozen essays and do an exam. To not have to do either makes my head hurt a bit. I don&#39;t get my result - of my honours degree in Criminology with Psychological Studies - until mid-December. Nervous?&nbsp; Oh yes. I am also going to have to catch up on the gazillions of TV programmes I&#39;ve downloaded onto our magic box and not watched. That includes best part of a series and a half of Buzzcocks, most of the last DW series AND Feildmouse&#39;s solo show. Oh, and True Blood. And some QI. And others. I could actually get quite stressed about the amount of TV I have to watch, which is a whole lot retarded, but that&#39;s the way it goes.</p><p>In other news, I have also just&nbsp;&nbsp;applied for a big, senior job at the place I work.&nbsp;It&#39;s a step up with a step-up wage. It scares me but it&#39;s also the sort of role&nbsp;that would be my next step career-progression-wise. We shall see. It&#39;s the first job where&nbsp;I can think &quot;tick&quot; when I see that a&nbsp;degree is required.</p><p>Nic&#39;s set up business in buying, restoring and selling miniature steam engines. The company website is <a href=""http://www.flywheelsteam.co.uk/"">www.flywheelsteam.co.uk</a>. If&nbsp;you know&nbsp;of anyone who might be interested in any way, shape or form please point them in the general direction. We&#39;re trying to do the hardest of things - sell without ebay. I don&#39;t quite know how we do it, but I am using bits of my PR knowledge to good use by social media-ing us right up. We have a facebook page, twitter account, G+ account and You Tube channel. And&nbsp;we blog and do pictures and videos. Next step is&nbsp;likely to be advertising,&nbsp;which is where things get a bit serious. Plus, of course, neither Nic or I have ever set up our own business before so we don&#39;t really know what we&#39;re doing. Any tips are gladly received.</p><p>I&nbsp;am also going to set up my own sewing blog.&nbsp;Sewing&nbsp;makes me happy.&nbsp;I never was very&nbsp;good at drawing or painting, but I can sew something that looks like how I want it to look. Mostly. Sometimes it goes awry&nbsp;but that&#39;s the nature of the beast. Anyway, that will be here: <a href=""http://redellen75.blogspot.co.uk/"">http://redellen75.blogspot.co.uk/</a>&nbsp;It&#39;s empty at the moment, but I shall be updating given time. Please come find me if you are at all artistic or sewing or crafty or pretty picturely minded!</p><p>And that&#39;s about it. I am trying hard not to stress. It&#39;s weird that when you&#39;re studying you have stress for a reason. Take that away and your brain seems to just stress about non-stressful shit. Like I can get rattled by thinking about having to do two things over the course of a weekend. Very odd.</p><p></p><div class=""PoweredByWebStory"" style=""margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:10px""><a href=""http://webstory.my/cs_invite.php?u=8840"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Chrysanth WebStory"" src=""http://image.webstory.my/WebStoryLogo20.png"" style=""border:0;"" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://webstory.my/cs_invite.php?u=8840"" target=""_blank"">WebStory</a>: Let&#39;s <a href=""http://webstory.my"" target=""_blank"">Blog</a> n Roll!</div>"

"event","<p>It's been bloody months since my last journal-type confession. </p><p>The highlights of the past few months have included rejoining weight watchers, after I was told that I don't ovulate. Because Nic and I would like a baby, I had to have a fertility test. Since I am overweight, or at least that's the doctor's present reasoning, I don't ovulate and therefore, need to lose at least 10% of my body weight. </p><p><br>I don't mind weight watchers. I have just had a weekend of ignoring it - long story! - but by and large weight watchers suits me. I have to remark on something I've noticed and I include myself in this. When you start talking about diets, everyone tells you which one is the best. iPhone apps, the Cambridge diet, slim fast, slimming world, the cabbage soup diet, low carb diets, the Atkins diet, the grapefruit diet, diet pills... All of these have been recommended to me. It's lovely that people want to help but holy Ryvita, let me do the diet I want. I go to WW because, for me, it works. That's it. I don't have the energy to do calories, but I can do points. </p><p>Now, the worst thing I can comprehend, it the Cambridge and 500 calorie diet. Essentially, in the 500 cals diet, you eat normally but on 2-3 days per week, you only eat 500 cals per day.  This is supposed to be brilliant, and that might be fine, but, personally, I can't cope with feeling like I'm punishing myself. If I am hungry, feeling a bit fainty, can't eat what I want... Then I am miserable. I will, rather inexplicably, burst into tears at any given moment. Turns out that lack of food outs my mental state into a place normal reserved for Morrissey and Eastenders. </p><p>The issue is that when you recount this to people, even enormous people who should have some mother-dieting empathy, they look at you as if to say, ""you're so shit, you have no will, no control and you are, in fact, retarded. Here, have a kit kat.""  Losing weight is hard work. It sucketh. So why don't we lighten up and give people a break? Let people do the diet they want. Encourage them for doing it. Stop feeding them cake... </p><p>Actually, that last thing is an issue...</p><p><lj-cut text=""continuing..."">My mother has become a sinister, channel-4-documentary-able, sneaky, creepy feeder. Since I started WW my mother has been on a mission to seek, lard up and destroy.  She has made weekly cakes, scones, pies, bought cakes, biscuits, macaroons, ice creams, pies and many, many other non-diety things, which she offers me and, thus, I often give in to. I feel rather... Sabotaged. </p><p>In other news, Nic and I found ourselves in Glasgow railway station on Friday. It's rather a lovely place but it was rather full of nutters. In the space of ten minutes we saw: </p><p>1. A girl with black lipstick. Goth all you like but black lipstick always looks like you've eaten something unpleasant. </p><p>2. A granny dressed head to foot in purple with bright f-off purple hair. I rather loved her in a strange way.</p><p>3.a girl with leopard skin trousers pulled up to her armpits.</p><p>4. A girl in purple, Lycra, shiny jeggings.</p><p>5. Another granny in a quilted leopardskin jacket and safari trews.</p><p>And...</p><p>6.

I have a few notes on this. </p><p>1. Calling gay people ""freaks in front of daughter and her gf is a bit mad. Then using the word n****r is not helping matters. <br>2. Nic's sister has the most laid back baby in the world.<br>3. Beachy head - the only place I've ever been where there are 'Samaritans' stickers on the pay and display parking meters, a 24 hour emergency chaplain and roadside Samaritans signposts. <br>4. Brighton rocks. </p><p>Finally, we went to a sewing expo thing in Brighton on the last day of our holiday.  I have really taken to cross stitch and needlework in a big way. It works for me, basically!  I do patterns, but also do bits and bobs of my own thing and really enjoy it. So, since we were near Brighton, we decided to go to this exhibition/fair thing. The average age was mid to late 60's, with a high percentage of older ladies. This, of course, makes it vicious. You hear, from behind you, ""Oooh, ribbons!"" and suddenly a bony elbow is embedded in your ribs, a handbag walloped into your gut as the white haired torrent barrels by, leaving a faint mist of lavender and <i>Elnett</i> in her wake.

"event","<p>I would love to say that our breakfast trip to Wetherspoons on Sunday morning was in any way as entertaining as Saturday. Sadly, it wasn't.  Our Saturday evening was rounded out by a trip to a Harvester, where Nic and I, despite telling each other that we must not be allowed to have pudding, both scoffed ice-cream.  Nic's sister's baby was as good as gold when were in the Harvy; she just sat in her pushchair, chilling out whilst we all ate. She's a very cool kid.  We got back to the hotel and parked in a variety of non-spaces before deciding to stick the car where it had been the previous night. </p><p>At Wethers the following morning, we were maintained by blokes talking about football. Very, Very dull. However, we did spot a female couple who were SO trying to not be seen as a couple. They basically sat on each other's laps and mirrored each others movements meticulously. It was sort of cute in a tragic sort of way. They were both very middle class looking; they could have both been teachers at a private school or something. I was most tempted just to sit there and write their life story really...</p><p></p><p><lj-cut text=""ficette fing under cut ""></p><p><i>'Just two friends having coffee,' that's what she thought.  They both looked respectable; Sheila in white and cream, pearls and cashmere, Diane in black; smart trousers and a woollen coat.  Two friends having tea... And coffee, in a nice, respectable pub. A family pub. </p><p>She would have preferred china. The tea came in pottery cups; mass produced rubbish.   Tea should always be in china. </p><p>Diane sipped her coffee and smiled.  ""Not everywhere, or everyone, has the standards that you do."" </p><p>It was Sheila's turn to smile. ""I know."" She wanted to tell Diane that she knew her too well and that betraying that fact was betraying them. No, she thought. She didn't want to say that.  It was fear that made her want to hide. She was hiding herself as well as them.  It made her scared that people would know and what they would think. She didn't want to answer the questions. </p><p>""Have you heard from Jerry?"" Diane asked, clearly concerned. She was a solid warm strip along Sheila's side. They were sat too close.  They always sat too close. </p><p>""No... Well, not really.  He wants to know if there's someone else. He thinks we can get through all this, unless there is... Someone."" Sheila squeezed her lips tight shut, not wanting to say, 'I don't want to have to tell him. I don't to say that I'm with someone he can never be.'  </p><p>""So tell him the truth.""</p><p>Sheila nodded, sucking her teeth before she realised, redrawing her face into a picture of calm. Diane said it so simply, so...</p><p>""I can't hurt him like that. I'm not leaving him because of you, I'm leaving him because..."" </p><p>""Because you stopped loving him a long time ago, because you've changed as a person, because the kids have grown,"" Diane replied, exasperated. ""I know, I know.... Why can't you just tell him the truth?"" </p><p>""It is the truth,"" Sheila replied, squeezing Diane's hand under the table. A reminder; they were in public. A warning; not too loud. A need to reiterate to Diane, 'I love you'. </p><p>""But it's not all of the truth,"" Diane said softly. Softer. </p><p>""I know,"" Sheila agreed.  ""But it's all he needs to know.""  She said it knowing it wasn't the truth.  She knew Jerry would never stop thinking that they could get past it and go back to normal.  In five years time, even if they were still apart, Jerry would still think their relationship could be mended. </p><p>Diane sat back and took a man-sized swig from her coffee. Sheila looked at her tea. They sat. In silence. </p><p></i></p><p></p><p><br>My desire to write is quite strong at the moment, but my time to do so is lacking.

"event","<p>Part two of my weekend saga - and the funniest...<br></p><p><lj-cut text=""Read more..."">On Saturday, we went for breakfast down the pub; we were told that Wetherspoons at the Opera House, Tunbridge Wells, was well worth a visit. We left the hotel and walked through the common/downs into the town.  En route, we passed a group of skinny blonde women doing yoga in the rain.  There is, it must be said, a large population of skinny blonde women in Tunbridge Wells, along with haunted looking old people. It reminds me of suburban Surrey... where I almost lived *screams*.  In town, we originally went the wrong way down the high street, located on a steep hill.  Here we bumped into a Barbour and flat-cap wearing vicar, who looked like he'd just shot some pheasant for tea. Most disconcerting. We were also openly stared at for walking arm in arm.  We rather expected someone from the local press to take our picture.  Imagine the headline, 'lesbians spotted on Mount Pleasant' ad the byline, 'on Saturday morning, the all-female couple [all two of us], both in their thirties, said they were ""unrepentant"" about walking arm in arm past shops which sell children's shoes'.  The horror.  </p><p>After refusing an interview with Radio Kent, we alighted to the public hostelry and ordered breakfast. Whilst I was ordering at the bar, Nic sat at our table taking pictures of the amazing surroundings.  It really is a very beautiful pub as they've left as much of the original Opera House interior intact.  We were both amazed at the number of people drinking alcohol at 10am, however.  One drunk, a chap in his 80's swigging brandy, went up to Nic and demanded to see the pictures she had taken just in case she was taking pictures of him.  Nic complied.  He also asked where her husband was - the elderly lothario that he clearly was.  Nic replied, ""at the bar"".  Both of us will, when not pushed or stroppy, just go along with statements like that. You take that choice; to make a big deal of it or not and, to be honest, sometimes it's too much hassle. People assume you're straight - it's sort of unfair but... it happens and you just can't be a constant vigilante about it.  ANYWAY!  Elderly lothario then proceeded to tell her the history of the building, including talk of the Queen mother and Wellington's sex life. Upon my return to the table, the man gave me a double-take and focused on Nic, telling her about the tunnels under Tunbridge Wells - built by Wellington, of course, in order toget his end away.  It's normally me who gets roped into conversation with mental or drunk people, but my emerald green skinnies were clearly acting as a freak repellent system. </p><p>Our breakfasts arrived and drunk and disorderly left us - finishing off his double brandy with a flourish.  We were then joined by a staff member of the pub. </p><p>""I'm working a ten to four shift today.  It'll fly by."" </p><p>We both smiled.  </p><p>Behind us sat a man with his hair on backwards. Or maybe sideways. His hair started quite a long way back on his head and stuck up at a slight angle as went over the crown of his head, giving him the appearance of a balding, overweight, Herman Munster. Opposite us, the table of pensioners who had been swigging since they arrived, got another round of Guiness' and G&T's in.  Someone asked 'ten tiol four' man if he'd drunk ""too much already"". When I later went to the bar to order more tea (rock and roll!!!), he asked her if she would be having salad for tea or cooking her own dinner. She considered telling him she was frying up a cos lettuce with a cucumber and thought better of it.  Instead, she watched a man at another table count out all of his money into rows on the table, interspersed with his keys and receipts until he was happy and could finally read the menu.  He had an immense pair of turnups on his trousers, which gave him the sort of look one might normally expect from a paddling pensioner at the sea side.  By the time I returned with tea, an uberdyke couple were sat next to us.  Had drunken lothario still been in, he wouldn't have looked twice.   Or maybe only to check out whether either of them were female. Meow. </p><p>Strange money counter man asked us to 'watch his breakfast' whilst he ordered himself more tea.  We did as we were bid, also chatting to another couple about Northampton Saints rugby team.  Hubby was their biggest supporter... in Kent. Brilliant! He reckons he supports Saints because their home ground and supporters are so lovely. That's true, that is.   Money counter returned and began counting his baked beans. </p><p>Chubby Herman ordered two burgers and two coffees, explaining, when they were delivered, that he was waiting for 'his friend'.  He then scoffed the lot in about two seconds. It seems his friend was in his head. Or, perhaps, his stomach. </p><p>Ten til four looked at our table and sighed. ""You're making more work for me."" </p><p>Suddenly, a piece of broken glass landed on my arm from nowhere. Perhaps it was the ghost of Wellington having a barfight with the Queen Mother.  Apparently she was a regular visitor to the Opera House until it became a pub. Afterwards, she came igcognito through Wellington's tunnels, probably. </p><p>Ten til four told another three customers that he was working ten til four. He's cut down his hours y'know. Everyone's doing it. He doesn't mind though, cos it'll fly by. </p><p>A lady in white appeared.  ""Oh, where shall we go?"" she squealed like a drunken Esther Rantzen crossed with Jodie Marsh.  ""Look at that chandelier!  I hope it doesn't drop one me!""  Because, of course, that's very common.  All chandeliers are just waiting for a woman in a white tracksuit, fake tan and nasty peroxide job to appear so they can throw themselves at her.... </p><p>This was the point where we decided to have a wander around Tunbridge Wells and find the Pantiles.

On a Travelodge.  I repeat, in a Travelodge. Who decides to have their wedding at a Travelodge?

"event","<p>The story of my recent few days comes in several posts.  This is mostly due to the fact that a good chunk was written pen and paper in bars... But there you go.  Here's part one. </p><p>And yes, the sanest part of my weekend was being photographed by a dwarf in a shopping centre. <br></p><p><lj-cut text=""Read more..."">You find me this evening in the Travelodge Tunbridge Wells. This salubrious location comes at the end of a very strange day, the sanest part of which was being photographed by a dwarf. However, let's start nowhere near the beginning and explain why I am in Royal Tunbridge Wells.</p><p>This town, scarily similar to suburban Surrey, is where Nic's sister and brother in law live. Brother in law is currently in Portugal where he is playing golf. He is currently undertaking a 'challenge' to get a golf pro score in a year having 'given up' his job in banking. We are here to visit with their gorgeous new daughter, Gracie May. Nic's am and pa are also here, but staying at sister's house. </p><p>We came back to the hotel this evening after a meal at Frankie & Benny's. We decided to go there after the pub was full. Otherwise we could have eaten at a gurkha restaurant. I kid you not. The road our hotel is on was closed off due to an accident. We pulled up to talk to the policeman about how we got to our hotel. He turned out to be Nic's cousin. Not unnatural, you might think, until you remember that Nic and her cousin are traditionally from Newark in Nottinghamshire. </p><p>The Travelodge has a lift - again, not surprising until Nic and I found out that you can break it by jumping up and down. I feel dizzy all the time whilst we are in the hotel. I suspect it might be a trans-dimensional lift of doom. I expect Matt Smith to jump out of the mirror at the back. </p><p>The car park here is shit.  </p><p>And the M25 hasn't improved since last I was on it. However, we did pass a plumber rolling a fag whilst driving, which was pretty special. Earlier on in the day, my father flashed me in his car. It's a shame you can't call Childline when you're 37.</p><p>Earlier, earlier, I was shipping off to Milton Keynes to have some corporate pics taken. We were having pics taken in the shopping centre by a guy called Tom. </p><p> Now, I knew, before meeting him, several interesting things about Tom.  I know he goes to swinger and 'key' parties. I know that he does internet dating and that his best mates are all female. I also now know that Tom is a dwarf.  His assistant is a fashion photographer with a pink fringe.  </p><p>One of the vagaries of having photos taken at the CMK, is that you have to have your picture taken first by a woman who works for the Centre. She gets you to stand in front of a black lollipop and pose. What she doesn't tell you is that she has all the photo taking brilliance of a blind gnat.  My picture came minus the top of my head. Tom's missed out his nose, mouth and chin because he was too short. Dreadful.  </p><p>Between them, Tom and Pinkie managed to put me in strange poses wandering around MK shopping centre feeling like a fruit loop.  At one point, Tom laid on the floor and made me pull my glasses down my nose and look at him over the top in a stern-mistress way. I may have just had naughty madam pictures of me taken by a sex-driven dwarf and a pink lady. Hmm. Either that, or I look formless in charge of an iPad and a lovely pair of red specs. One of my colleagues, Gemma, turned up in spike heeled bondage boots. I suspect that, if she wants him, she can have Tom for breakfast, dinner and tea.    </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/ipad/link"">LiveJournal app for iPad</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","I managed to recreate a scene from &#39;Fried Green Tomatoes&#39; and not from a good point of view. I took Nic to her retinopathy appointment at Stoke Mandeville yesterday. &nbsp;We searched for somewhere to park. &nbsp;Then, ahead, I found a space and zoomed in with a speed which surprised everyone, including me. We got out of the car and someone in a silver Skoda pulled up and told me I was rude for pulling into HER space. &nbsp;I started to reply, &quot;sorry, I didn&#39;t rea...&quot; and she had wound up her window and driven off. &nbsp;

It&#39;s such a small thing, but it really bugged me. It&#39;s a shit car park; there are spaces where you can, literally get blocked into and never get out of until 3 other cars move. &nbsp;There&#39;s no room to move; some of the roadways are single track, so you have to reverse, pull forward, move about, wish your car was a transformer and, eventually, sit in a corner, weeping and rocking. &nbsp;So, there I was, going backwards and forward, all over the shop then, suddenly, like a big glowy thing, there was a space. There was a silver Skoda attempting a three-point turn in the corner. &nbsp;It was never going to work. Turns out, this impossible turn was, instead, a &#39;I&#39;m going to back into this space&#39; move from a mile away and a very odd angle.

After Nic and I had scarpered (or rather, Nic had convinced me I didn&#39;t need to run around the car park apologising to strange blonde women (the skoda lady was blonde; this isn&#39;t just a strange blonde-woman based tic I have developed) or from running back to the car every two minutes to check no one had gone all Kathy Bates on its ass. We then went into the posh, new Mandeville wing, where I could sit down and paranoidly look around for strange blonde women who might want to hit me with a hammer whilst someone was making Nic&#39;s eyes look freaky. &nbsp;

It was not until this morning, with a painful pulled muscle in my neck (it WAS painful before the paranoia, but it certainly didn&#39;t help) and wholly unrelated tonsillitis, that I realised that I may have been assuming disproportionate amounts raged within my blonde, skoda-driving&nbsp;nemesis. &nbsp;

I&#39;m fine now. Once the counselling is complete, I&#39;m sure I will manage to take my mother there for her second eye op shortly. It&#39;ll be fine.&nbsp;

Does anyone have any armour?&nbsp;"

"event","Here in house of crowson, we have had a debate about the government&#39;s current plan to give very low paid (well below minimum wage) work to prisoners. Of course, the media being a contentious, scare-mongering, shit-stirring git ponce, has worded this as &quot;Jobs created for prisoners&quot; and suggested that this is keeping non-prisoners out of work. &nbsp;Now everyone in my famile thinks this is dreadful. I think it&#39;s brilliant and I have to say why or else I will explode. &nbsp;Not that I didn&#39;t make my view clear to my family, but I need more rantage. Please ignore spelling errors.&nbsp;<br /><br />Is this step keeping non criminals out of work? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;These jobs would not be given to your average man on the street in this country for one very pertinent reason. They are jobs which pay well below the minimum wage. These are the jobs which would be given to people in Mumbai, not the UK. &nbsp;By keeping them in the UK we are doing one very important thing - we have a chance to tackle reoffending and give people a second chance. We also, by virtue of doing so, enable payments to victim support too.&nbsp;<br /><br />So why is that important? &nbsp;<br /><lj-cut>Well, to begin, in the land of ASBO&#39;s, we&#39;ve done a great deal to ensure that a lot of children from bad neighbourhoods will enter their adulthood with a criminal record. An ASBO (Anti-Social Behaviour Order) is a civil offence, but one enforced by criminal law - if you don&#39;t fulfil the terms, you get a criminal record. Now, lots of people will say &#39;don&#39;t do the crime...&#39; but ASBO&#39;s get given for silly nonsense things. In my street when I was a kid, Sunday afternoons was a time when the menfolk worked on their cars outside their houses. You can get an ASBO for that. When I was a teenager, me and my mates used to hand around in the town centre and natter, piss about, buy chips, etc. &nbsp;You can get an ASBO for that. So, these are not proper crimes. They are bullshit a lot of the time. &nbsp;<br /><br />So, we being the fabulous nation we are have criminalised our teenagers and our poor (do rich kids hang around and talk in town? &nbsp;No, they have the money to do more interesting stuff. Next!). &nbsp;Having down this, we lock them in prisons and assume that 6 months forced idleness will make them model citizens. Oddly enough, it does not. Instead, our people who have never had a job because of their criminal past, find it even harder because they didn&#39;t learn anything in prison, they didn&#39;t go to school and they aren&#39;t going to find another job because a prison sentence shuts a shit load of doors. Then, we get all surprised when they reoffend.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, I know this isn&#39;t true of all criminals, but the statistics are shockingly high.&nbsp;<br /><ul><li>75% of youth offenders reoffend within a year.&nbsp;</li><li>Almost 50% of all prisoners released from prison will reoffend within a year.&nbsp;</li><li>The social and economic cost of reoffending after short sentences alone is &pound;7-10 billion per year</li><li>37% of prisoners have stated that they will need help finding a place to live when they are released from prison</li><li>12% said they had a mental illness or depression as a long-standing illness, while 20% reported needing help with an emotional or mental health problem</li><li>24% said they had been taken into care as a child</li><li>Almost half (47%) said they had no qualifications</li><li>13% said that they have never had a paid job.</li></ul><div><ul><li>64% of newly sentenced prisoners report using a drug during the four&nbsp;week period before custody (30% heroin, 28% crack cocaine)</li><li>&nbsp;44% of offenders assessed in 2008 had problems with alcohol misuse&nbsp;which may have required treatment.</li></ul><div><br /><div>Female prisoners are more likely to report histories of violent and sexual abuse. Almost half of female prisoners, compared with a quarter&nbsp;of male prisoners, reported having suffered from violence at home.&nbsp;Furthermore, around one third of women prisoners reported suffering sexual&nbsp;abuse compared to fewer than one in ten men.&nbsp;</div><br />In six out of&nbsp;seven intervention and employment programmes identified by the&nbsp;review, offenders in the treatment group were&nbsp;significantly more likely to be employed at least&nbsp;six months after completion than those in the&nbsp;comparison groups. Let&#39;s talk numbers - the prison population is currently 87,749 people in the UK. &nbsp;There are 20,000 jobs. They&#39;re not going to go far, so the people who will get them will be the ones on short sentences for minor offences. The ones who actually, have a better chance of being rehabilitated.</div></div><br />Having a job and experience in employment is just one way of tackling reoffending and, rather than attacking it, the media and the public should give it a shot. &nbsp;There are those who would say that if you commit crime you should lose your rights... Bollocks to that. A lot of prisoners never had rights or even care. By not allowing them opportunities to stay on the straight and narrow, we make them outcasts - and outcasts struggle to give a shit about a society that treats them like shit. We are in a cycle of perpetuating abuse, illness and isolation and ignoring it is not just inept, it&#39;s cruel. &nbsp;I hate the death penalty, but part of me knows that locking people up without trying to help them is way more inhumane. &nbsp;These people - those with drug/alcohol abuse issues, the abused, the mentally ill, the battered and raped, the uneducated - these are the prisoners of the UK. &nbsp;Do they actually deserve to be treated like shit? &nbsp;I can&#39;t think of a single reason why the answer is yes. And I&#39;m not talking about mass murders or child abusers, I&#39;m talking about people in jail on short-term sentences for relatively minor crimes. Once you are a prisoner or deemed a criminal, it marks you for a long time. &nbsp;Where&#39;s the second chance for someone to be anything but a criminal?&nbsp;<br /><br />I strongly agree with Winston Churchill when he said,&nbsp;&ldquo;The best way to judge a society is how it treats its prisoners&rdquo;, said Winston Churchill, even if it was just a rejig of Dostoevsky&#39;s &ldquo;The degree of civilisation in a society can be judged by entering its prisons.&quot; &nbsp;What they mean is that how we treat those who have wronged us is a judge of humanity and civilisation. Society made criminals, just as it made non-criminals. &nbsp;They are are part of our society, despite whether we put them behind bars. &nbsp;They reflect us just as we reflect their wrongdoing upon them. If we want a good, decent society, we have to start looking at who is included in that picture and not just pretend that they&#39;re not there. They cost a huge amount of money -&nbsp;<span style=""font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: small; "">it&nbsp;</span><em style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: small; "">costs</em><span style=""font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: small; "">&nbsp;on average &pound;47,000&nbsp;</span><em style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: small; "">per year</em><span style=""font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: small; "">&nbsp;to keep someone in prison. That&#39;s a lot we spend on being able to put our fingers in our ears, shut our eyes and go &quot;lalalalalalala!&quot; Tax evasion - criminal offence, but one with far lower conviction rates than shoplifting - costs &pound;69 billion per year. Just saying.&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Who amongst us has never broken a law? &nbsp;We tend to distance ourselves from criminals and think it&#39;s us or them, but who hasn&#39;t broken the law. Most of us probably do every day. So what makes us innocent and them criminals? &nbsp;A sometimes arbitrary decision, based on politics, history, contemporary society&#39;s rules and who has the goddamn power to make one thing a imprisonable offence and another ignored. When was the last time you heard of anyone being imprisoned for wearing a suit of armour? &nbsp;Never, perhaps? &nbsp;Well, it&#39;s a law and it can be broken and if someone did, they&#39;d get a smack on the wrist and a fine for a minor public order offence. A few hundred years ago, going into the house of commons covered in tin was <i>evil</i>. &nbsp;The reasons why one person takes morphine in a hospital whilst another injects heroin or smokes weed, might be the same but the law decides one is a criminal and one isn&#39;t. Had John Barrowman been born 60 years earlier, he would be a criminal. &nbsp;Let me be clear; that line between criminal and non-criminal? &nbsp;It&#39;s very thin in places.&nbsp;<br /><br />And personally, do I think the power of the law is on my side? &nbsp;Don&#39;t be so silly. I didn&#39;t go to the police when I was raped because I was raped by someone rich studying law. Law is an abstract concept only defined by power. Your average criminal? &nbsp;He or she is like me - powerless. &nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, let&#39;s NOT forget the payments to victim support - payments none of us make. Victims of crime aren&#39;t treated very well either. I think it&#39;s because we hope that distancing ourselves from victims will make us less likely to be one. As I said above, we are all part of this society - a reparative ideal would be that each criminal makes some sort of amends to the victim. The payoff would be for both to walk back into an inclusive society with another chance to live their life differently. That is a model being tried with young offenders and I think it may just work for those sorts of offenders. It won&#39;t work for all; all victims and criminals are individuals and there&#39;s never a one size fits all.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, to summarise, there is a very good reason to give prisoners work and no small part of it is humanity. It&#39;s about knowing that one act does not have the power to show the value of a human being. A string of acts - like genocide - might do, but an ASBO shouldn&#39;t lead someone to an end in which they never have a life outside of a cell. Where is our compassion? &nbsp;Where is our decency? Perhaps that&#39;s in prison too.&nbsp;<br /><br />(stats from the Ministry of Justice &amp; the House of Commons)&nbsp;</lj-cut><br />"

I will, when I get there be working full time. I have, with much sadness, given in my job at the garden centre. I love that place. I would love to have my own shop. I really would. If i was in the right place, I would have a second-hand shop.</p><p>We have started snowing here btw... This is a HUGE topic in England at the moment. The fear of snow is a weird one, but rather fun despite that. I refuse to feel any way but just love snow. It's an inconvenient mother itch, but I still love it. Ir's been -11 in Buckers for the past couple of mornings, so yep, it's been a bit cold. <br></p><p><lj-cut text=""Read more..."">I may have to eat my words about the LJ app. My iPad was courtesy of a tax rebate. I find it very comfy for writing and useful for study - the iTunes Uni section isvery user friendly on iPad.  </p><p>Small rugby interjection - I love the new coach and the fact he's kicked out players for lack of discipline. Think on <a href=""http://http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-16578054"">Danny Care</a>. However, I think each and every game in the Six Nations is going to be a struggle for England. We're working on a team for 2015 rugby world cup and I think that's a grand move. We're going to have pain in England before then though. I keep telling myself this in a hope that it will lessen the pain of losing! And I still dislike Charlie Hodgson as 10. (in a one-off hark back to my previous nekkid rugby posts, pls see <a href=""http://http://www.omgblog.com/2006/11/omg_hes_naked_scottish_rugby_g.php"">Sean Lamont</a> NSFW and full nudity therein. </p><p>In terms of Scottish rugby, I would like to point out how much Patterson will be missed. He's a rugby 'great' and I am going to miss the little tremor of fear his presence on the pitch created for an England fan watching a Calcutta Cup game. </p><p>Ooh handbags at dawn! </p><p>Health wise, or, rather, anxiety wise, I am getting there.  I don't feel quite so nervy all the time.  Beta blockers are wonderful things.  I have got much, much better in that regard. I think I was just over wrought after having a number of bad, event packed years. The changing my job every year for the past 3 has been difficult and I think that's been a major factor.  It takes me time to fit a new job, and when I'm losing my job just as I am getting comfy, then it does a number on my confidence and my nerves. </p><p>In OU land, I am enjoying my final module - Social Psychology. I do wonder sometimes why I didn't do a degree purely in psychology when I feel natural doing it, but I never wanted to be one of the many psych grads who can't use their degree. I am realising, though, that the aegis of feminist discursive psychology and phenomenology suit a lot of my understandings of people and many of my Criminological views.  </p><p>I must also report that I am a bad fan girl and have not yet watched 'Luxury Comedy'. I aim to soon - they're on my magic box.  Views please! </p><p>I am, however, loving One Born Every Minute. I have become, in the last year, very, very broody. I know that, at the age of almost 37, I am entering the period at which I am unlikely to be able to have a baby. That makes me very, very sad. I am going to try, I think.  This requires Nik and I to be in our own home, so that's the next plan.  </p><p>In other news, I am working on a bit of cross stitch for Nik's sister. I am enjoying my sewing at the mo. It means I can just zone out for a bit and enjoy simple process. I also have the sort of nature which means I have the patience to do it. Cross stitch isn't hard, it just requires patience and so, it works for me. </p><p>This is a very scrappy game. I would go as far as 'boring'.  Boring is the phrase that sums it Nik's views on rugger. The in laws have announced that Nik and I are going on holiday with them later in the year. I don't know when or where, but we have been informed.  I like the in laws and they still like me. Isn't the whole in law thing a tad weird though? You're trying to ingratiate yourself to another family to become considered as a member of the family.  And yet, whilst you become close, you also have an element or reserve and even tension. Sometimes Nik's mum says things about Nik which makes me want to jump up and down and tell her not to talk to my partner like that. And yet, she's Nik's mum so I sort of can't... And I want to tell her she shouldn't behave that way because she IS Nik's mum.  We also don't tell them some things because they will go mental because their values are different. I get really confused and sort of on edge by the whole thing.  But it is getting more relaxed, I think. </p><p>On that note, I will sign off. Sorry for the long and rambling post. My brain is working that way at the moment! </p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/ipad/link"">LiveJournal app for iPad</a>.</i></span></p>"

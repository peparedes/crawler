"event","Hey guys! I just got back from the part store. I got my dad door handles for his car. That thing is so ghetto! I am trying to make it more tolerable haha. So anyways I was looking for a bumper for my car all day and I had no luck. I just need the bumper so I can finish the car and paint it. My brother and I had gotten this really pretty blue color for both our cars. I think my car will look damn good after I am done. I will try to upload some picture of it so everyone can see them. 

Grrr ebay is frustrating!!!  People are so DUMB. Don't people know that E-CHECKS are JUST like checks, THEY TAKE A FEW DAYS TO CLEAR. MY GOD GEEEZ! This idiot is complaining becuase I didn't send out the item right when they paid. WELL YOU F(*&$ING IDIOT you sent me an E-CHECK! Go back to f*&^ing school man.  Ok good I got that out of me lol.

I just got cingular! haha I have used sprint for the longest time. I thin sprint has a weird compression they use to lower the bandwith of their sites.  When someone talks really low or you are trying to hear background noise it's VERY hard to hear.  After I have been with cingular I can hear like everything. It's odd too, I have had like 4 different sprint phones and all of them were like that so it must be something in the towers! haha.

Well I am done talking about stupid shit and I need to go now. Everyone take care <3 <3

"event","Today was pretty good,  I got a few things to fix my car up and it's running very good now.. I went to some chinese resturant and acually ate sea food (icky) but it wasn't so bad I guess. I ate sushi! haha I don't think i'll be doing that again. talked to some old friends today, they are doing pretty good, I hope we all can hang out sometime. OH and I put in an app today for work, isn't everyone proud of me?? I have like 4 resume's to give out tomorrow so I don't think my unemployment will be much longer. The open bar last night was pretty good, drank 4 vodka drinks and two beers, I got pretty drunk off the last one though, they mixed like 7 diff drinks all in one so ya lol. The only thing that sucked was that my step sister calls me up saying that they fucked her on the bill and it was like 100 times more than expected and it was for her birthday so I feel so bad about that. Anyways I have to get going to sleep now. Harv and I have a long day of sanding and primering my car haha... gonna fix the exterior now! howww funn!  Just dropping a line,  I love all my friends! No hating me <3 . .. byee"

"event","Hey everyone! this is Taylor, now some of you had some pretty ""harsh"" words... ,One girl said she wanted to kick my ass because I'm a slut and a cunt, And all I have to say about that is ""Bring It Bitch"" , Yea, come to my fucking neighborhood (Downtown Lake Worth),and I'll fucking blow you away... I'm not like all you pussy ass Emo kids ... I'll fucking slaughter you! 

  Anyways, Yes, I am dating Jason. big fucking deal! He's fucking awesome, and pretty fucking hot. , and I think that you guys need to keep your fucking mouths shut about us, or at least put some fucking blows behind your words... Oh, and for that girl who wanted to ""knock my teeth in"", yea, I'll fucking bust in your face with my skateboard. you talk about ""pent up anger"" well, nothing would make me happier than to beat your face in with a rock... yea, i'm a fucking savage bitch... and your a filthy cunt! 


  And to Leandre, I was just playing around! I didn't know the intensity of the situtation I guess, but christ! you need to not take everything so seriously! I would say stop being so emo , but I'm asuming that wouldn't help... If your still mad, I'll let you punch me in the face. , but who knows what that might lead to...

"event","I met this girl today. Her name is taylor. wow, lol.... I can say that she is just great =)! I never met a girl that could skate vert and be so pretty hehe.  It's awesome. We are planning on going skating tomorrow. 

I slept like from 7:00pm to like 12:00 am today.. I'm not really getting too much sleep. There has been so many people in and out of my house the last week and it kills me lol. My sister seems to think I am doing a whole lot of drugs but I want everyone to know that I am straight, I did it once and thats it. I do enjoy smokin my cigs now though haha. Makes me less stressed and I can deal with alot more. Kris doesn't like that idea either, I am going to do it either way tho so she better not keep throwing it in my face lol... I love you kristina and I am sorry if I am upsetting you.. worrying you or whatever. I'm fine and will always be. I can only get ahead. 

I went to look at the first car today. MY GOD was it a piece. We drove like 50 miles to get there and the guys had already warmed up the engine. I hate when they do that becuase you can see everything that is wrong with it first. I then check the body kit. It was hella loose. The hood wasn't there. I decided i'd try to drive it and try to see if maybe there was SOMETHING special about it... Tranny was gone... DIDN'T even go into 3rd gear, fourth gear only went into second. Stick was loose, And almost hit another car becuase the break booster decides to work late. Anyways... Tomorrow I am looking at another one and it looks alot cleaner. After that I get to see taylor <3 =) yayyy lol..

Har-v and I decided that we're both going to be street racers and have fast cars and show off. So we're putting 5 grand more into our cars than we already would have in them.. And maybe when I get a steady job I am going to drop a skyline motor into it =)  ooo YEAH hehe.

Well I better be getting to sleep if I want to see the car tomorrow and see taylor. 

Oh and THANK YOU DUSTIN, you are so awesome for bringing taylor by so I could meet her =)"

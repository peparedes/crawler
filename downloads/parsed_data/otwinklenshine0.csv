"event","I feel like right now I am at a place that is all to familiar,, it's scary, and hopeless... I just sometimes wonder if it will ever get better. But I suppose no ones lives are perfect, even if they seem that way. 
  Lately I feel like I have lost some of the closest people to me, and i wonder if that is good or bad? Right now I am really upset about it, and yes i miss them so much, but I seem to always depend on them for my happiness, and i know that's not right. I am just afraid of anything changing, because in my mind everything is ""perfect"". But i suppose friends come and go , but the real ones stick around... so i guess for once, I am going to depend on God to help me through this time. As strange as that may sound, and as hard as it is for me to do, Its something that i HAVE to do... because there is no one here who seems to understand.I guess my thought for the day is.. Have you ever felt like everything was irrelevant,because when real life happens all the little things  just seem to go away and become unimportant?"

"event","I have been thinking a lot lately about what i want to do with my life. Like i look at all of our parents and only half of them seem happy. I just don't get why you would choose to do something with your life, that you know wont make you happy... I sure as heck am not going to sit around and get a job that sucks and be miserable forever. It's just stupid, like i realize some people don't have a choice but the majority of people do. Right now we can do whatever we want with our lives, so why waste it? I jsut want to be able to get on with life, and not look back and have to say "" Why didn't i do more with my life when i had the chance?"" I am not sure personally what i want to be or who i want to be, but i am not going to let myself get to a place where i will be cornered and not able to turn around. It just scares the crap out of me to think that i will be nothing.


Well tomorrow is homecoming.. I'm not going lol But i think me and Adam are hanging out so that should be fun :) 

I have to work on saturday at fricken 7 in the morning... ugh!! So i can't stay out really late.. 

What i don't get is why people walk around being mean and ignoring someone for no reason? I figure even if you don't want to be friends you can at least be nice enough to say hi... but i suppose you won't realize that because you only think about yourself, but i am just saying that i will never not be your friend.

Nae.. I sorry things aren't going so great... Let's make some money and leave!!!"

"event","I have come to the realization that I am a horrible friend, but in all honesty I just feel to tired to care. I have this way that I can just push all of my ""problems"" to the back of my mind, and not have to deal with them, and yes... pretend everything is okay and that my world is perfect. I miss danae.. I miss seeing her everyday, hanging out with her everyday, and jsut .. i dont know.. not caring about anything. We could just lay around and do nothing and just be content. But it doesnt seem to be that way anymore, and most of it is my fault.  I know she will alwyas be there for me, which she has proved over and over again, but I can never seem to make anyone happy. So i ahve decided to float along and whatever happens, is uppose happens. That is not a good thing to say, but i figure whats the point in even trying, when no one will be happy in the end. I just wnat things to be how they used to, but i am sick of saying that.

"event","Hmm.. well as we all know school is now in session :) I am actually liking it this year it feels more normal, and more routine. It just sucks  having to do hw and stuff but i dont really care that much.

Right about now, i am confused (suprise huh?). I don't know what i want out of anything, I really am trying to figure things out, i just honestly am at a point where i just don't know how much more i can take....But i am always changing my mind, so i don't want to make a stupid decision that i will regret, which usually is the case. So I AM LOST! i want someone to choose for me, and brent no not you lol F-U-C-K fuck fuck fuck! I just think maybe my priorities are off a little....


  
 

Take what you need
'Cause I can't hold my breath
Say what you feel
'Cause I got nothing left 

I made a promise to myself last night
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right 

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose
And I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful
It's a chance I'll take even if I break
And I lose it all, if I lose it all
It wouldn't matter anyway

Don't change a thing
You're perfect as you are
Time has a way 
Time is all I've got"

I just feel like this whole summer i have done everything that i thought i never would do, or even ever wanted to do. I've just become the oppostite of what i always thought i would be... what am i supposed to do now???? Start over, or just keep turning into someone i have always dreaded becoming?? Sometimes I just wonder, what's the fricken point? It is way to hard to please everyone and i obviously suck at doing that...so here i am, again, confused and alone. I suppose that i am essentialy not alone, but i just feel like no one understands me right now. I just can't be the person that i am expected to be. I GIVE UP!

Hmm... i obviously can never make you happy .. so i guess you win, i give up. But don't expect me to always be perfect because no one is... maybe you are but im not.. So i am sorry that i cant meet your standards, but i will not be treated like crap, just so you can get a kick out of it. I will always love you as a friend, but obviously you can't deal with me having a boyfriend and other friends, so im sorry i am not ditching them for you. I am also sorry that i like to hang out with adam, and that maybe he actually treats me better than you will ever know. Inconclusion, i hope you eventually learn what friendship means. Its not somethign you earn or have to work for, friendship is when two people trust eachother enough to tell them things that are going on, and always be there for eachother NO MATTER WHAT.And i am sorry i do not fit yours.

Me, Lisa, and Kyle got up at 7 and went to Hutchs to get cake mix, frosting, and skittles for Adadm because i amd ""making an effort"" =).. then we got home and made it blah blah then at like 9:30 we took it over but he wasnt there so left it in the kitchen (EEE! breaking and entering!) So then we went to and ""undisclosed location"" to get some.. stuff.. for an oopsy! haha it was definatly funny... but yeah so then I called Adams hosue and i talked to his mom and i guess Alex f. was with them and he had gotten into a car accident(she said he was okay though) so she wnated me to call my mom because she works in the emergency room.. so i called her&nbsp; and asked her to meet them at the hospital when they got there... so i hope hes fine and its noting serious! BUT IT FREAKED ME OUT!! ahh! <BR>&nbsp;</P>

oh well.. I'll move on.... Anyways these past couple days ive been working at MIS for choir. It was pretty fun on friday ""workin it"" with steph( BALLET at 4:40 haha) Then on saturday Cameron was my partner and it was fun talking to him for like 10 hours.. but after a while it was boring and FREEZING!! So adam is grounded for ""2 weeks"" after our little incident( OOPSY) but it was worth it! RIGHT?!?!?! hahaha I just read beths livejournal and i never new that there could be that many comments in one persons thing! HOLY CRAP! Now that Antoines leaving pretty soon my nae nae is going to be sad.. which kinda sucks because summer is supposed to be fun...but i guess this couldnt really be avoided.                                                                          I just wish that life could be a little simpler sometimes...There are so many things that are hard to deal with and i dont know if i am capable of doing that right now.... I mean i know everyone has their own stuff to deal with, but when one of your best friends doesnt seem to care?? I dunno it just seems that sometimes i would be better off by myself... I just want you to be here for me, maybe like i was for you?"

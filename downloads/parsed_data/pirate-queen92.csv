"event","Today was the all fated day I was going to Projekt Revlution. I was so excited, you have no idea. I couldn't sleep last night and I paced the house this morning waiting for my ride.&nbsp;

I arrived and got to see Madina Lake. Who were absoultely amazing and I had my first mini-moshing experience. Pretty cool, especially since the water tossed around made me feel nice and cool ^___^
However, the main reason of my apperance there was for one band. Well two, but for one MAIN AMAZING band. My Chemical Romance. The first time in a while they were to play in jersey, and I was going to be there! how sweet, right?&nbsp; Well fate absoultely hates me, I swear cause after I got signatures from the guitarists in Madina Lake, I got fucking sick.&nbsp;

I had heat stroke, and a policeman had to drive me home. It was awful, I missed mcr, was sick and laying around while they played a good set(all of them are good in my eyes).&nbsp;

This was probably one of the worst days of my life........."

"event","I'll never understand why I seem to fall hard and easily towards any potential partner that shows any sort of caring in my direction. It is like a sickness, even if I know the person obviously feels nowhere near how I do or is even right for me in general. I fall and I fall fucking hard. 

I've run out of excuses for it too, even though before I started typing this sentence I was certainly looking for one. Just makes no sense, especially when when it comes to my family it is damned near impossible for me to express love but towards a woman I become a  hopeless lovesick puppy.

And really that isn't the biggest problem, my problem is my jealousy and temper, just because I commit myself to someone I am interested in it seems like my emotions expect the same. Regardless if the person is actually in a relationship with me or not. It disgusts me. I need to change this, I am twenty eight years old, I shouldn't still be having these immature teenager levels of emotions. I really wonder if I should start going to a therapist. Even though I'm posting this into the ether I won't feel comfortable telling the girl this is about about my mindset. Because my biggest problem is fear of losing her in my life entirely. Even if she is hardly even in it at all and seems to not give too much of a crap about me to begin with. I need clarity."

So yeah, I guess my life has literally decided to go back to like 2005 or some shit.

I'm single again, my choice. I just couldn't get over things that happened.

I live at home again. Not my choice but the house I was staying at was sold. So now I'm a loser who sleeps in his parent's living room while all of his stuff is either boxed away in the basement or in storage.

That pretty much sums it up.

But if you see me in person or ask me, I'll probably deny it or hide the fact of how totally screwed I am. If I'm lucky I make $300ish a week. That is how much my rent is a month. Add onto the fact that the electric bill averages in the hundreds and the gas and water combine add into another hundred. I am totally screwed. And to be honest it only seems like three people truly care. Me, my mom and Hayley. I doubt anyone else does or frankly I would've gotten more notice. Not to be thrown to the wolves on basically a whim by someone who at this time last year was asking me for my spare room. It fucking hurts. Through everything that sticks out in my mind the most. I helped out a friend this time last year who I doubt even batted an eye on what kind of situation he now leaves me in. Which is over my head. I can't find a roommate cause my parents are supposed to eventually buy out my dumbass uncle. I can't nor won't ask anyone for any money. I'm screwed. Seems like life always does this to keep me balanced and a realist. I guess I can't have everything. I have love so I can't have money. I have happiness so I can't have complacency.

Hayley and I are officially boyfriend and girlfriend. And I couldn't be happier.
I mean hell! In the first week of our relationship we've planned to do more stuff together than my past combined and fucking multiplied.

Speaking of which this just became a really busy year.

I'm taking her down the shore next saturday. And I can't wait
I got Rockstar Mayhem in August.
I got my week vacation down the shore.
We're going to go to the Renaissance Faire at some point.
I have my trip to see the Phils spank the Mets in Shea Stadiums.
We're going to go to a bunch of Flyers games when the season starts.
I'm getting a newer car at some point this year.
Can anyone say Eastern State Penn pt.2? Oh yeah, going back this year and taking my girl with me.
I don't know exactly what I'm doing for Halloween but I do know who I'm spending it with. :-)
Same goes for Christmas and New Years. :-)

I'm a very happy guy right now.<B><u>VERY</b></u> happy.

I look forward to what the future holds. Especially with her by my side."

"event","Wow, it has been a long time since I've posted an actual post.

A bunch of things have changed since then, some I won't mention because if you know me, you already know.

But I will mention that most likely I will be getting a better car for nothing as long as my ""uncle"" remains an idiot.

Also my living situation will be changing within a year, I'm not moving, its more my family is....to here.Which is good for me seeing as I won't have to pay rent anymore but it sucks that I practically have to kick Craig out. I'm sorry man.

Another thing that has changed is I've begun to see this amazing girl, her name is Hayley and I really <b> <u>REALLY</b></u> like her. I've never been this interested in a girl in about two years. And surprisingly enough she likes me too. I get to see her again in a few hours which is just awesome and I'm giddy like a child just about spending time with her again.

It really does feel good being with her too, because for the first time ever I feel I can be myself while with someone. And not have to try ridiculously hard to woo them or try to change myself into the person they want so they stay with me.

So yeah, life is good. I'm looking for a new job, hopefully a state job, that way I can have a change of scenery and also stop destroying my body as well. I actually have a girl that I can hopefully soon call my own. And by the end of this summer I'll have a car I can actually be proud of.

Most of all, for the first time in a loooooooooooooooooooooooong time I'm happy. I mean completely happy and actually alive again. Its good to be out of the darkness and back into reality. I really have missed it."

"event","This has been one interesting year so far in the best ways possible. The main thing being that I have lost a bunch of weight and am continuing to lose weight still. For the first time I'm actually going to put out there how much I weighed when I started this diet. I weighed 370. Scary, I know. Now for the good news, I currently weigh 330. I've lost forty pounds so far. Forty fucking pounds! Holy shit! At this rate I am only six months away from my goal weight of 250. That is amazing to me since I've been big for most of my life.

The other interesting thing is my father is actually going to help me when I go for my next car. Which will probably be May. As most people who have read this thing for a while know, my father and I don't have to great of a relationship at all so that was surprising to actually have him agree to it.


So now that I feel unstoppable in doing and getting what I want, I am making a bold statement that will be true. By fall of 2008 I will be a college student, finally.

Its odd how things change.....at one point in my life this was one of my favorite holidays. I used to look forward to it every year. You know the basic kids stuff, the easter egg hunt, the candy, the overall fun. But nowadays since I'm older alot of holidays have lost their meaning and value to me, including this one. I mean my family pretty much does nothing different on this day except cook a ham (a turkey breast for me since I don't eat ham) and thats basically it. There was talks of perhaps dying some eggs so that might be a little fun but besides that nothing. I get up, eat breakfast, go to work, come home and then eat dinner and call it a night. I truly do miss some aspects of my childhood, just the general innocence that is now lost. I really can't pinpoint the time in my life that I became so dark and serious either...its like a blur to me. To all that read this today Happy Easter! Hopefully you'll find ways to enjoy it, be it with family or loved ones of any kind. Me? I'll be dealing with the last minute jackasses at Shop-Rite."

"event","I really have noticed something about myself I guess I have previously forced myself to not notice or just to flat out ignore. I am not as innocent as I have made myself out to be for my past. And after <b><u>YEARS</b></u> of ignoring it I am finally going to accept blame for my actions.

I know now that I have treated some people unfairly in my past and have blamed everything on them without looking to see if some of the blame belonged to me. Well it did and does. Sick thing is I wouldn't have noticed unless I did those same actions with another individual some almost three years later.

And yes I know I am being very vague right now but to the ones this is about, they already know what I mean and as always I am using this journal as a means to vent and to explore my own inner self.

What I will not be vague about (and trust me this is going to be a hard one) is the fact that I have noticed I am very insecure. Which will also explain why my actions that hurt others happened when they did. They always happened when I thought I had nothing at all to lose.

My insecurity mainly comes to play when I feel I do. Like when trying to get romantically involved with someone I always over think <b><u>EVERYTHING</b></u> and question everything instead of having that never say die confidence I have at the wrong times. Which is what I have noticed has made me give off more of a friend type of vibe than anything else. Whereas when I feel I have nothing to lose I'm more like well myself I guess. Or at least the confident guy I wish I was.

So in short this is a rebuttal to myself for every single post I have ever made and only laying blame on the other party. This is my way of at least attempting to remove the venom and knives I've inserted in situations over the years.

All in all, this is me doing something that is extremely hard for me.

This is me saying I'm sorry.

I'm sorry for hurting those I know I hurt, whether it was yesterday or years ago.
I'm sorry for continuing to hurt you by laying blame strictly on you at any chance I get and just plain being a spiteful prick.
I'm sorry that now due to my actions a select few do not feel entirely comfortable with me.
And I completely understand why."

I'm hoping it has but I can't really tell seeing as I see myself everyday and can't notice the subtle changes if there are any. Today is also the day where I am going to talk to him about everything I want to get taken care of health wise. Like my inability to breathe through my nose due to a post nasal drip, see what to do about the cosmetic issues about my knees and to also possibly talk about seeing a chiropractor to bite that bullet before its too late.

To say that I am anxious and nervous is an understatement. I really don't want to find out that my dieting has been a failure. I've almost completely changed my eating and drinking habits to a ridiculous degree. I hardly if ever partake in the foods I used to enjoy.

I really hope I am on the way to a healthier better me.

Then my next challenge will be my god damned horrible self image. The self image that has been fucked up since I was a lad that continued to become more and more fucked up with every failure of a relationship.

It has gotten to the point where I have no confidence in myself and do not like looking at myself in the mirror anymore. Thanks <strike>Samantha</strike>,Jonette,<strike>Chade</strike> and Angel. Thanks a lot.

You know what? Fuck that last line! Its my own fucking fault to allow myself to continue to be affected by minuscule bullshit that happened with each of them. Time to grow the fuck up already.

Time to stop hating myself already. Fuck! I'm awesome! If you don't agree with me....fuck you."

"event","January:
I don't think I did anything too special this month. I'm honestly even wondering what the hell I was talking about in last year's year in review blog about this month.
""January - It seems that January is always my slow month cause the only thing I remember about that month is starting my new LiveJournal and posting up my dating criteria. Nothing too exciting. <b>Oddly enough January 2007 seems like that will break the trend but y'all will just have to wait and see.</b>""
Anyone have any ideas? If so comment me or message me what I was referring to. Cause I really have no fucking idea.

February:
Didn't do too much. My oldest brother turned twenty nine and we went to Whiskey Tango to celebrate. I also saw Saliva live in concert.

March:
Another not so active month. Won tickets to go to ""Rockstar Taste of Chaos 2007"". Went to the first Phillies game in my ticket package on the thirtieth to see them play the Red Sox in spring training interleague play.

April:
Rob turned twenty three.  I tried dieting and failed miserably. I went to see Stone Sour at the ""2007 Jagermeister Music Tour"". I also went to see the Phillies play the Mets and Nationals.

May:
Had a joint birthday party at Whiskey Tango to celebrate Nicole turning twenty one and my twenty second birthday. I also went to see the Phillies play the Brewers on ""Ryan Howard Bobblehead Day"" and the Blue Jays as part of my ticket package.

June:
Saw the Phillies play the Giants and had the opportunity to boo Barry Bonds along with the rest of the fans at Citizens Bank Park. I also saw the fightin's play the White Sox (and give Jim Thome a heroes welcome) and the Reds (for two games, one being part of my ticket package...the other being a firework night). My mom also celebrated her birthday on the 15th.

July:
Took  part in a surprise birthday dinner for Heather. Went to Red Bank, NJ to go to the Quick Stop and RST Video stores and also went to Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash and bought some View Askew goodies. I also went to see the Phil's play the Nationals again. This month my aunt also passed away from cancer.

August:
Went to the ""Family Values 2007"" and ""Ozzfest 2007"" tours respectively. I also went on my usual family vacation to Wildwood, NJ. I also started packing and moving my stuff over to my new place...which was the first floor of my grandparents old house.

September:
Formally moved into my new apartment and also got an unexpected roommate out of the deal too, Craig. I also went to see my family doctor due to suffering some severe knee pain the past few months that got nothing but worse only to be put on medical leave from work until the pain was diagnosed and possibly treated. I also went up to New York with 4/5's of my family to see ""RENT"" on Broadway with two members of the OBC returning for the time being (Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascal). I also purchased Anthony Rapp's book at the show and had it autographed by him.
As usual I also went to another Phillies game where I saw them play the Rockies. I also saw them play the Nationals (again) and try to keep their NL East lead over the Mets.

October:
I went to fabulous Las Vegas,Nevada in my first ever plane ride.(Check out the picture folder on myspace to see pics of the trip). I also went to the ren faire for the first and last time of the year.
Went to Eastern State Penn with a bunch of friends for ""Terror Behind the Walls"". Also went to ""Valley of Fear"" with friends too.
And also threw a Halloween party in which in my opinion was a bust and left me stuck with leftover Domino's pizza for like two weeks.

November:
Went to see the Flyers play the Boston Bruins in the best tickets I've ever had for a professional sport.

December:
Got medically cleared to return to work and told to diet. Hung out with Amanda a bunch of times. Bought an xbox 360. Went to Dicken's up at the PRF. Celebrated Christmas with the family. 
Wrote a year in review blog.

* I also went to a scattered number of PWU shows throughout the year."

"event","I figured since I have a bunch of stuff on my mind yet again I'd give one of these unplanned free flowing blogs another shot. Hopefully it'll be an interesting read, if not atleast it will cleanse my soul a bit.

Lately due to the anniversaries that come this week and the reminder from health physicians of my own mortality among a bunch of other things have got me thinking about my life in general and these are my thoughts and feelings.

I believe it may be time for me to actually grow up and start getting my life in order like I've been planning for over seven years now. Way before ShopRite. It is time for me to finally start studying for my G.E.D instead of complaining about the job I'm stuck at due to my lack of an education. It is also really high time for me to seriously start dieting, in which if anyone actually reads this damned thing they can see I've started...sorta. Yeah I am dieting but I am nowhere near what I should be at yet and I know it will take time.

It is not a comfortable feeling to know that if you do not get your life in order health wise you're only cutting short the time you have here and especially the pain and illness free time. So now at the age of twenty two since I've never taken care of myself I have to deal permanently with arthritis in both knees and I have to make big leaps and bounds now. When if I actually put more effort in, none of this would be a concern at all. My current health is nobodies fault but mine. I'm growing up enough to admit as much.

Just like my complacency and lack of motivation to get my G.E.D and go to college to better myself is also my fault. It is due to fears I have built into myself, no one else put them there. And instead of dealing with them and dealing with the impending change I have been hiding.

I also know I am not strong enough to do this on my own and yeah I have asked for help before and never followed through. I hope putting all of this out here will give me the motivation and courage to do so. Because this is a big leap for me to truly be this honest about a lot of things. I don't lie but I have censored.

I also know that in order to make myself appealing to the fairer sex I also should do those changes, which for most would be enough. But yet again it is self built fear because of preconceived notions of women that I have placed into myself due to some not so bright moments in my past. Which would be my attempt at a romantic life thus far.

And this will also be hard but I am writing it anyway.

Some of those problems are my fault. When trying to be in a relationship or even when in a relationship I immediately give my all and blindly usually. I rush into everything haphazardly just because I feel that if I don't give 120% to a girl she'll no longer want to be with me.

What I do not realize is I've been giving so much to the wrong women because if I had mate who was truly in it for me. Those things would not matter. I would be accepted as myself, not for how much I make myself available to them, at all hours of the day no matter where I am..or by showering them with ridiculous gifts.

I'd like to say those days are over but I will not know for sure until my next romantic encounter. I hope I atleast have learned my lessons and will take heed of my own words and advice for a change though.

But for now I am taking a break from romance anyway.

Its high time that 120% gets put into me helping myself. Into me becoming healthy and fit. Into me getting educated so I can finally join the real world and a true work force and not retail. Into finally getting my damned license instead sitting on it and pushing it off.

Its time for a new damned era.

In essence its time for Kev 3.0 because as much as 2.0 was an improvement in areas, I still also had bugs in others.

Time to work on those.

Time for a new me.

A better me."

One of the last few days I truly felt anything, also the day you left this world.

I miss you daily, especially now when I sit in the house you called your own until your death. Wishing that it was I who went and not you, or for that case Mike (his death was five days later). You two have so much more to give to this fucking world than I do. You two meant something.

I'm going to start dieting again starting with today and probably in private blogs leave what I ate that day so I can critique myself.

I am also going to start using the treadmill Craig and I are getting from his parents so I can actually exercise.

The only thing I ask from my readers (friends and family) is to make sure I stick with this. To bug me endlessly to post on here my progress and to also just overall stick with the damned diet and exercise!

Wish me luck with this, hopefully by my 23rd birthday I'll be under 300 pounds!

"event","Eventhough most blogs lately have been upbeat this one has to be posted because well fuck! Its just how I feel.

Lately I feel as if since I went out for medical leave that to most of my ""friends"" I've been forgotten. Because for the most part, aside from Missie, Nicole, Jon and Craig I haven't heard a peep from anyone else. Not even a ""Hi!"" Nothing, zilch, nada. And it is honestly in my opinion truly fucked up.

I mean these are the same people whom I'd practically give my life for and bend over backwards for and now that I'm hurt and not around, I don't count.

I do hate these feelings too because I do love my friends, I'm just starting to doubt if those feelings are mutual for most of them.

I'm turning off comments to this entry because I don't even want to hear any excuses if I even get any.

Just remember when I'm not there for y'all in the future I'm just repaying back the treatment I received."

"event","I swear man, I am destined to this. Craig may be ""good luck chuck"" but I am definitely ""Mr.Transition"". What do I mean by ""Mr.Transition"" you ask? Well by the end of the following blog you shall understand.

In life there are very few things that I can count on and that will always ring true. Two of which are the usuals, death and taxes. The other being that 99.9% of the females I get involved with romantically will still have attachment to their exes. So far I am five for seven. 

Now what I truly mean by calling myself Mr.Transition is that yeah, normally people have some residual feelings for exes but the girls I involve myself with usually fit the following two requirements....

A) After being with me in anyway shape or form they decide to go back with their ex and usually either end up in a really long term relationship or what has happened twice...the longest type of relationship in existence. Marrying said ex. Option B is slightly different but the same outcome for me overall. 

B)After being with me in anyway shape or form they no longer have any feelings for their ex before me, even though throughout their time being with me they retain it, and start fresh with the next guy without that guy ever hearing the commiserating about said ex I had  to hear and not hearing a peep about me entirely. As if I didn't exist whatsoever.


So by being ""Mr.Transition"" I end up being the transitional guy between the ex and either of the choices.

And believe me, I am not speculating or making up this status of mine. I can prove it, even from the start, the first girl I was involved with.

Samantha:
After involving herself with me for about three to four months culminating with us hooking up. I find out she was still with said ""ex"" and then if I have read correctly...they are atleast engaged.

Laura:
She was interested in 5 guys total including me. One of them being her ex.

Jonette:
Y'all know most of this already, we were friends...she said if I wasn't dating someone with whom I truly wasn't dating anyway we'd date... She strung me along then went back to her ex Matt. They are currently atleast engaged if not married and have a kid together.

Chade:
We dated a couple of times last summer throughout which most of the time she always complained of how her ex Ron fucked her over. After almost losing my job being there for her after he talked trash about her/us/whatever she vanished on me and ended up with someone else. I doubt he ever heard about how crappy Ron was to her or about me at all.

Angel:
We were talking for a few months and as with Chade I heard about how crappy her ex was almost daily. Granted it alteast was with good reason this time, her ex was an abusive prick..unlike Chade's ex man whore. So I could understand venting about it, especially when you date the person for three years and once lived with them. What I didn't expect was finding out today that she still has residual feelings for him. We decided to just remain friends and now I wait and see if they end up back together or she moves on with someone else.

All in all, much like Craig..I am tired of my trend and hope that with the next girl, whoever she may be, I break it.

I hope you enjoyed this and feel free to leave your thoughts and any questions."

The rest of the time I am coasting and just relaxing and enjoying it as if worst case scenario just a bunch of learning experiences I can grow from. I refuse to become attached to anything at this point since attachment at times leads to paranoia and flat out suffering. Instead I'm just taking a step back from myself and going by instinct. Hell!

"event","Since sleep seems to want to evade me due to my mind racing with an enormous amount of thoughts from the mundane to the tragic to the flat out just silly I figured I'd type out a free form post about whatever comes to mind while I type.

First off if I haven't made it 100% obvious by now I no longer live at my parents house anymore, I moved out to the first floor of the duplex my great aunt owned before she died with whom she left half to my dad and his sister who also ended up dying.

So yeah, I got my own place. With whom I share with Craig currently since I had an extra room which I was going to use as an office but I figured helping out a really good friend at his time of need took precedence to having an office space. Its been cool so far and really fun. I guess thats what happens when you live with your best friend of the past five years.

I am also not working currently. Since to put it bluntly, my knees are shot. I have the amount of arthritis as at least a middle aged person if not an elderly fellow. So now I wait to see what the rheumetologist wants to do about it and then I'll know when I return to the hell that is work.
Granted I've enjoyed the time off, I've been able to spend time with friends and family. Time I wasn't able to have before. I was also able to go to New York City to see RENT on broadway and this week I went to Las Vegas, Nevada.

The trip to Vegas was a whole bundle of awesome. Aside from the fact that I didn't win it was great. I got to see a couple of shows like ""BITE"" and ""Penn & Teller"" both of which I had VIP seating and met the cast afterwards. I really do miss the glow of the lights right now honestly. I shall go back one of these days.

Now the near future I will be going to the Renaissance faire for the first and last time in 2007 which is kind of disheartening since I went from a season pass holder in 2005 to not really caring about attending lately. I also am going with a group of friends to Eastern State for their haunted prison tour. And I am throwing a Halloween party to celebrate the holiday and the fact I am living on my own. All are welcome.

The future honestly from what I see looks pretty bright. I mean yeah, my dating status is cloudy and murky but when isn't it? Hell! I should be happy right now. What other average twenty-two year old can say they have their own place AND their own car? Not many.

Well I'm currently running out of thoughts so I'm going to finish with bringing back the F.A.Q.'s


The F.A.Q.'s
Still single? See above ""murky and cloudy""
Still into Buddhism? Nah, Kevism for the win!
Still living at home? Nope, I'm a real type adult now! XD 
Still at Shop-Rite? At the moment yes, for over five years now. Scary isn't it?

By the way, leave me a comment on what question you want added to the F.A.Q.'s and I shall answer it here and include on each future entry.

Till then......"

For the next few days until I come back Thursday night I will be spending my time living it up at the casinos and catching shows and just getting away from all the drama my life seems to be surrounded by currently. It will definitely be a good change of pace. If I somehow have an internet connection out there I will be sure to upload  photos and throw up a blog or two to document my time there in my downtime if I have any. To say I am excited is an understatement, I kind of wish I didn't have to come back :-p. Well, time to sleep so I can get up in enough time to go to breakfast and then the airport.

I swear I can envision my life as a television series with all of the zany and ridiculous stuff I've been through my entire life.

From all of my romantic catastrophes to my friendships and just life in general.
It really is funny and also kind of sad to think about and while having a conversation about it with my roommate I just started truly thinking about it. Like I joked with him, all I'm missing is the canned audience noises. That is it. I mean seriously, I am Drew Carey in his show sans the hot chicks. I've had the Mimis (coworkers who did anything and everything to hurt me in some way). I've had the Mr.Wicks (the crappy bosses). The only thing I honestly miss is the zany sidekicks. It always seems like I'm the sidekick if there is one.

It is a shame I'm not a better writer. I would turn my life into an actual sitcom and then be rich! XD I mean I even have the wacky family.

I guess I'll update this again another time. I just wanted to pour these thoughts down since they are so prevalent currently and have been before and I just never jotted them down previously.

Well now I have,
I'll write an actual update eventually if anyone actually cares.

I am seeing tunnel vision in a world thats dark and cold,
I cannot believe how much I've changed since the days of old,
I know it's temporary but I need to focus straight,
I cannot believe I lost control of my fate,
I need forgiveness from the people I truely care about,
I need support behind my back to help me spit it out I am gonna win,
I can't afford to blow this one,
I hate myself sometimes,
I love myself,
I need this way of life because it holds me.
contradictions the way of life happiness is wealthyness is healthy
now I've made it through those lies and deceit,
I think whats done is done and I can't complain anymore i am sure,
now that I've found myself again it feels great I can't believe
I'd lost control of my fate.

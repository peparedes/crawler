"event","i thought i knew you when you walked into the room, you said you didnt recall my face.sometimes my memory is short on time but long on space.you can't see me but your eyes are wide open
and then they turn right into stone,you are fleeting but icould neverforget those eyes that break right through my bones.they say dont try to be with her, its the hardest thing to do.
i want to look to the colors of the sky and watch them fade right into night.hte colors could become memoriesand they would never fade far from sight.
dont try to follow her home,its not the road you want to take.wont you step out of your iron castle and come see me?"

When I said I didn't love you 




So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell,
blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? 
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
Running over the same old ground. 
What have you found? The same old fears.
Wish you were here."

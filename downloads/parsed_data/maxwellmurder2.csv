"event","Dear India, 

      It seems that no matter what day I flip open my paper or go to one of the various online news sources I regularly check, I see another special interest, medical anomaly from one of the villages in your fine country, India. Babies with two faces, babies with eight legs, children with tumors on their face that way in excess of 10 lbs... you folks got it all! Don't get me wrong, India, I'm not here to chastise you for your medical anomalies, in fact no one should be chastising you these days. In a world where the constant fears of nuclear war, holy wars, and the ""demoralization of our children"", you folks seem to be getting something right. Your economy is growing more everyday, your business men are growing savvier thanks to globalization, and your medical school students come to our country to learn our methods and then take them back to your country to improve your own hospitals. Now I'm sure many of my country's people believe that you're stealing jobs away from us, but I'll openly commend you for your methods. If anything, I'm envious of your people because an expensive operation like a triple bypass surgery costs tens of thousands of dollars, in your country it only costs a fraction of that. I'd hop on a plane and get my surgery in your country if I ever needed to, but my government has made that illegal. 
      Another thing I'd love to commend you on is the treatment of the children who are born with such bizarre deformities. Heck, in my country someone in a wheelchair can still be stared at in horror, but not in your country. If I remember correctly, it warmed my heart when I found out that your country's people treated a child that was born with eight limbs like a goddess. Oddly enough, if that little girl was born in my country she would be carted around to every day time talk show currently on the air so everyone could get a slice from the octo-girl pie. Now at face value I'm sure these look the same, but I assure you they're not. In your country, this little girl was a goddess, she was praised and seen as a good omen. In my country, she'd just be a ""medical anomaly"" which is just a sugar-coated way of saying ""freak"". In all honesty, India, I could probably write on and on about how amazing your country is from what I've read and how amazing it would be to see it with my own eyes, but I think this will do it. Nothing too thoughtful, nothing too provoking... just that I think my people could learn a lot from your's.

5. NO GOOGLING/using IMDb search functions!

1) ""They told me there was nothing out there, nothing to fear. But the night my parents were murdered I caught a glimpse of something. I've looked for it ever since. I went around the world, searched in all the shadows. And there is something out there in the darkness, something terrifying, something that will not stop until it gets revenge... Me.""

2) ""No I didn't. Honest... I ran out of gas. I, I had a flat tire. I didn't have enough money for cab fare. My tux didn't come back from the cleaners. An old friend came in from out of town. Someone stole my car. There was an earthquake. A terrible flood. Locusts. IT WASN'T MY FAULT, I SWEAR TO GOD.""

3) ""We've been going about this all wrong, this Mr. Stay Puft's okay, he's a sailor, he's in New York, we get this guy laid we won't have any trouble.""

4) ""I'm sorry I'm late, I had to attend the reading of a will. I had to stay till the very end and I found out I received nothing... broke my arm.""

5) ""All right now, for all you boppers out there in the big city, all you street people with an ear for the action, I've been asked to relay a request from the Grammercy Riffs. It's a special for the Warriors, that real live bunch from Coney, and I do mean the Warriors. Here's a hit with them in mind.""

6) ""I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy.""

7) ""Mr. Vaughn, what we are dealing with here is a perfect engine, an eating machine. It's really a miracle of evolution. All this machine does is swim and eat and make little sharks, and that's all. Now, why don't you take a long, close look at this sign.""

8) ""This little proposition doesn't entail me dressing as Little Bo-Peep, does it?""

9) ""In a way, each of us has an El Guapo to face. For some, shyness might be their El Guapo. For others, a lack of education might be their El Guapo. For us, El Guapo is a big, dangerous man who wants to kill us. But as sure as my name is Lucky Day, the people of Santa Poco can conquer their own personal El Guapo, who also happens to be *the actual* El Guapo!""

10) ""Don't stay up thinking of ways to get rid of me, it makes wrinkles.""

11) ""Hey, Mike, you think you can toss me my calculations? Thanks! Ah, here it is. ""Breach Hull - All Die."" Even had it underlined.""

You can find this in the sporting goods department. That's right, this sweet baby was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Retails for about $109.95. It's got a walnut stock, cobalt blue steel, and a hair trigger. That's right. Shop smart. Shop S-Mart. You got that?""

15) ""Ah. Well... I attended Juilliard... I'm a graduate of the Harvard business school. I travel quite extensively. I lived through the Black Plague and had a pretty good time during that. I've seen the EXORCIST ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SEVEN TIMES, AND IT KEEPS GETTING FUNNIER EVERY SINGLE TIME I SEE IT... NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT YOU'RE TALKING TO A DEAD GUY...

"event","So I'm sitting in the office today for Pat while she's taking the day off and I feel absolutely vile. I don't know if I'm sick, tired, or hungry, but I feel so bleh. 

Office work perhaps is quite boring for the most part. I answer phones, make copies, and listen to professors as they tell me that they're heading out for lunch and that they would be back in an hour. Occasionally they throw me a curve ball and I have to call the repair guys or get the mail or something. Ultimately, though, it's all one big ball of boring. 

In Stats today everyone was talking about the Superbowl and how much of a big upset it was that the Giants beat the Patriots. Who decides the mascots by the way? Wouldn't it be rad if there was a team called the Flamin' Gerbils? Mental note, if I ever have to coach little league sports one day, my team will be the Flamin' Gerbils. Anyway, some people turn to me and asked if I watched the game. Of course I didn't, I watched the Mythbusters marathon last night and it was incredibly satisfying. 

Lori and I have been watching Discovery the past few nights instead of Adult Swim and I have to say it's a welcomed change. I suppose you can only watch so many episodes of Family Guy before you get numb to it. It's much more satisfying to watch Jamie and Adam blow up things or Mike Rowe to crack jokes while sitting up to his neck in filth. 

Anyway, back to Stats class, some guy said that there is no such thing as luck because God has decided what's going to happen and that's that. ""Everything happens for a reason."" I hope I can put that down as an answer on Wednesday's test. ""Johnny flips a coin and the probability that it'll land on tails is 1/2. Why?"" ""God decided it would.""

In 19 days it'll be the 1st cough-iversary that Lori and I started dating. I'm quite excited and glad I have that long to prepare her gift. 

Oh, I dyed my hair red Thursday, here's a picture.

"event","I can't sleep. I'm dead tired, but I can't sleep. Something today really got under my skin and really disgusted me. I don't know, maybe I'm too compassionate.

In my Accounting class, I shared my book with a woman I had spoken to a little before in previous semesters. I had no problem sharing my book with her, but I was suprised I needed to. She had always been responsible and would've never left her book behind accidently. Anyway, after class, I offered to print copies of the pages we needed for homework for her, but she declined. She said she was going to see if the bookstore had any used copies of the book for sale. She said it was stupid that she was too scared to go home and get her book. Then I put two and two together, and added in her black eye. Chances are that someone whether it be a husband, a boyfriend, or a family member had done that. Ever since I left class that's been riding on my mind. 

I hate it. It's why I hate Aaron as much as I do. I hate domestic abuse. I hate the fact that this woman is too scared to go to her own house to pick up her book and would rather by a new book instead. What bullshit is it that she can't feel safe in her own home? I know from experience, it's one of the most degrading feelings in the world. Your home is supposed to be the one place in the world you're supposed to feel safe, yet you'll do anything you can to stay away from it. Hell, I made it a daily habit to have somewhere else to go everyday after school for almost a year. I can't understand how someone can do that type of thing to someone they ""love"". It's odd, the more these crimes get turned in, the less jail time anyone seems to serve. In fact, if you want to make sure that they do go to jail, make sure they are wanted for a dozen other crimes. The law doesn't care about people, apparently. The sad part is that I know way too many women who've had this happen to them, but this seems to be my state's favorite crime.

Personally, hurting the ones you love is a much more heinous crime than theft or posession, but no one around here seems to care as much as they let on."

"event","Holy hell, Corey's updating his livejournal!?

Condensed Over-all Update:

Lori and I are going on 8 months which is rad. She's currently feeling sick and playing WoW. 
I quit my job at the gas station and I'm working on campus now. The pay is better and I don't have to do half of the work I did at the store. 
My classes are going way better than they did last year. My Accounting class blows, but if I can squeak by with a C it'll be okay. 

Now, for a decent update. Yesterday I skipped school and work to sleep in and hang out with Lori. I got to the mall an hour early though, so I chatted with Tabbi at the book store and met a guy whose name escapes me at the moment. He chatted with me about how the college system was bullshit and how he was 12 years older than me and had been around the world. He told me how he was $70,000 in debt, but he had a plan, you see. His plan? Move to Canada and become a citizen. After hanging around Canada for 2-3 years, he'd move back and become an American citizen again and recieve a new social security number. So, in theory, all of the debt associated with the old social security card are both null and void. Awesome idea in theory, but we'll see how it pays off. 

After prying myself out of conversation with the nameless revolutionary, I wandered around the mall until I called Lori to find out where the little darling was. So, satisified with her answer, I picked a place to hide for my guerilla warfare strike. The Calendar kiosk would have to do. So, while pretending to be interested in the ""Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader"" day-by-day calendar, I kept my eyes posted on the corner around the Macados were I knew Lori would be coming. Sure enough, after a few moments, there she came in her dinosaur hoodie and as she passed the kiosk in pursuit of me - I pounced. Success! 

After messing around at the mall for a bit, we were off to run some errands and then get some food for our sustainence. After a quick trip to the bank and the gas station, to Applebees we go! Food was good as always and we got to sit in the big, rad chairs. At first we really close to these older people and that was a bit uncomfortable, but after awhile they left. The rest of the time, we ate our edibles and sang along/talked about/danced to the mixture of awesomely good/bad songs to not-so-awesomely bad songs.

Then, off to the shopping. We went to Wal*Mart, joked around there for a bit, and then we went to a comic book shop that was on Mercer St. that we hadn't been to. Now Lori may be nicer about it, but the place was just sad. They didn't have alot of anything, most of the stuff didn't have prices, and the hired help wasn't too much help. Basically, it was like some people found some boxes of comic books in their basements and decided to open a store. Lori found a used Neil Gaimen (probably fucked up the spelling to that) book that she wanted, but the gal at the counter couldn't find a price so she didn't sell it to Lori. Now, unless this book was the first edition of the fucking bible or whatever, I think she could've come up with a price in her head. Hell, five or seven bucks should've been enough, but nope, Lori didn't get the book and they didn't get any business. After that we headed to Cheap Thrills which is always an adventure I personally enjoy because I know that they always have this Henry Rollins Spoken Word cd for sale and, by god, I'm going to buy it. So I enter the store and like a heat seeking missle, I head to the used bin and BOOM... mission accomplished. So, I also picked up the Horrors' cd (also from the used bin) and Lori satisfied her love for British transvestittes and nerdy, Canadian country singers by picking up Little Shop of Horrors on DVD and a David Bowie cd. 

So we hop in the car and head back to Lori's house o'cats and raccoons to get the alotted time of cuddling and lovin's in. So, while at Lori's house, I check out the Rollins' cd and realize why it's always in the used bin... one of the two cds in it, is ACDC's Back in Black... not exactly what I was looking for. Oh well, the one cd is badass enough. So, while at Lori's house, we cuddled and loved on one another and watched the Emperor's New Groove. You know, I have no idea how I've made it this far without seeing that movie. I love Patrick Werburton and his funny, but loveable role as Kronk. The movie was just rad as hell and I'm just really happy Lori showed me it. 

I really need to tell my paranoia to shut the fuck up sometimes. She loves me so much that she'll show me cartoons and feel comfortable geeking out around me. Oh, and we're going to see They Might Be Giants and Regina Spektor next month in Charleston. Just two days after we're going to see Beowulf. 

On an unrelated note, Lori has gotten me into reading Kurt Vonnegut. I just finished Slaughterhouse Five earlier this week and I'm eager to read more. 

Well, that's all for now. I'll update this thing again maybe on a regular basis.

Corey

PS: I professed my love for Henry Rollins and Patrick Werburton in this update. I suppose I love big muscle-bound men... weird."

"event","Outdoors is a deck full of teenagers aged 15 to 21. My sister is having a party for no apparent reason, but that's all well and good. Unlike my oldest sister who made a big deal to go out there and join in on the party, I'm staying inside with my Gus. He needs the company. 

I miss Lori. alot. It's so foreign to go from spending a day with someone who understands you and grasps you without having to explain anything to her. I hope one day I can make her realize just how much of a miraculous feet that is and hopefully repay that debt to her. I'll never be able to understand how Kevin didn't find her marvelous... the very notion that someone can't appreciate how amazing she is frustrates me. Here's the girl who picks up the phone to call me, just as soon as I call her. She knows what I'm talking about or knows the answers to questions I haven't finished asking. Words can't express how brilliant her eyes look while I'm staring into them... staring deep down into her pupils like they're the endless sea of stars in space. I've always thought of myself as a bad astronaut who always turns left when it was probably better to turn right... but when it comes to Lori, I feel like I'm right on course. The very fact that I can only experience this comfort once a week is a pain, but always gives me something to look forward to. 

Sometimes I forget that I'm alive. Allow me to elaborate. Sometimes, there are things in the world that absolutely stun me or fascinate me to the point that I forget that I am Corey Flanagan. I just stare off into space and think about how bizarre and strange existance is. For instance, somewhere, right now... someone is dying from blood loss. Do you think they're too stunned from whatever caused them to bleed that they don't think about their impending demise? Or are they stunned because they realize what's happening and they're thinking back on lost loves, past regrets, and everything else? On the other end of the spectrum, right now someone is realizing whatever is going on in their life is not what they want to be and are being reborn? I dunno, I think I think too much about things like that.

"event","So, I decided to ONCE AGAIN brush the dust off of this bad boy and start updating it semi-regularly. So, in order to get everyone caught back up to speed:

 - My 4th semester is almost over, save for the online history exam I need to take before Friday at 6. 

 - David quit Blueflash rather than get his shit together, so I'm having to work their more to make up for his dropped shifts. 

 - Summer classes start sometime in June. I'm taking online Excel and online Physics the first half and then Online Microsoft Word and Internet the second half. 
 
 - Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and the Horrors are playing in Nashville on June 6th and I'm currently coming up with schemes to go. 

 - Oh, and I have a really kickass girlfriend still and she pretty much rocks my face. 

There, that should do it. So, here goes my entry about yesterday.

Yesterday morning I woke up at 5 to study for my Economics exam that I had at 8 in the morning. So, got my shit together, took it, and I should've done better to make a long story short. I probably made a low B or C in the class, but seriously, I hate economics. Then, I had about an hour and a half to kill before my Business Communications exam at 10. Well, in the process of studying, I was trapped into an hour long discussion with this older woman in my class named Saltana. Yes, Saltana. Well, she's the type of older student who loves to re-iterate her life story and just how hard it is to be an older student. Funny thing is, she's 26 and my buddy Kim is 28. Yet Kim is sweet as pie and chill as fuck. Well, whatever, the exam was easy as hell after I found out that I made all A's on the three resumes I had to turn in earlier that week. 

The next big notable section is my day at work, and baton down the hatches, this was a hell of a day at work. Well, it was fine til this black lady and her sidekick strolled in and tried to buy beer. The truth is, she looked old enough to buy it, but we've been told that we don't card enough, so I asked the lady if she had her id. She said no. So, I told her that I can't sell it. Now, children, allow me to sidetrack for one second and teach you a lesson that you will need to know when you get older. *clears throat* Do NOT get between a black woman and her alcohol. Lord knows she needs whatever help she can get as she pushes through her mundane, lower-middle class existance. Now, that may sound racist, but that's just how 95% of the black population in this city roll. So, does she oblige with the law, put back the beer, and head out the door? No. She proceeds to claim that I've never asked her for her ID before and that we need to start enforcing the rules all of the time. So, I tell her that the rules state that she needs to show me her ID if I ask for it and if she doesn't oblige, I can't sell it to her. She then responds by asking for my manager (who is my older sister) and upon finding out that she wasn't in the store, she then threatens to ""smash my mouth in."" I proceed to say ""What for? For doing my job?"" She blows off said logic and threatens to call the police. Now, I knew the law was clearly on my side in this event, so I told her that she was free to do so. So, she ""calls the police"" and heads outside to try to intimidate me. In the process of that, I called my sister who actually did call the police. Well, as soon as the ladies outside heard that the police were really coming, they left. When the cops showed up, they told me to call them the next time they came in causing a ruckus. After that, I had a headache for the rest of the shift from dealing with dumbasses. Note, this occured the second hour of my six hour shift. 

After work I was supposed to hang out with Amanda and the returning but soon departing Beth, but Amanda pulled out. So, Beth picked me up after work and we lounged around East River Mountain Overlook talking about life and friends. Beth cut her bihawks off and now looks exactly like she did when I first met her. So, between that and driving around listening to Alkaline Trio, I had the weirdest sense of Deja Vu. She's leaving tomorrow morning for Ohio where she'll spend her summer working at Cedar Point. When she comes back, she'll be in town for one day before she has to go back to Emory for soccer and school. Although she's caused me alot of pain, frustration, and anger... I can't say that I won't miss her this summer. 

I can say, however, that I'll be spending summer with the raddest girl in specs I've ever met! I can't wait till she gets done with exams so we can see each other more than just on the weekends. My poor Lori is applying for a job and I hope she does well. I sometimes feel like I'm trying to be so protective of her, but all that's done for me in the past is push people away from me. I can't help it, though, I just adore the girl so much that I'd rather see streams of blood pouring from my veins than have to see a single tear roll down her smooth cheek. She's my counter-part... the Pearl Forrester to my Observer. The Brak to my Exeter. It's been 2 months already, but it's hard to imagine how I was before I met her. 

Oh well, enough bragging about the dame for now. Goodnight my lovelys.

Corey Flamingo... keepin' it gangsta."

3. Even though you probably hate it, let me tickle you. 
4. Create stupid games with me like ""Mall Bingo.""
5. Randomly quote movies or shows we've seen together or laughed about. 
6. Be a little clingy. I like having someone holding my hand or having their arms wrapped around me. 
7. Smile when you see me. 
8. Whenever we see a movie, let me lean in and make fun of it. I promise it'll be funny and no one else in the theater will even hear me. 
9. When you lay down beside me, rest your head on my chest or shoulder. 

EIGHT things I want to do before I die (in no particular order):
1. Go to the Chikara school with Kyle. 
2. Catch either a Chikara or PWG show live. 
3. Explore Chicago, Philly, or Detroit.  
4. Open my own business and live the punk rock dream of being my own boss. 
5. Get hitched to some lucky dame. 
6. Get my license? 
7. Visit MissLiz, Lauren, and Dori in their respective locations. 
8. See Brian and Amanda Lee get the fame they deserve. 

SEVEN things that annoy me:
1. Kevin being uncooperative in play practice. 
2. Something going wrong at work in the first two hours.
3. Ex-girlfriends who don't have any tact.  
4. Feeling useless. 
5. When fast food joints fuck up my order. 
6. When shirts don't look right on me. 
7. Whenever sad songs play on the radio when you miss someone. (I know I just spent time with Lori yesterday, but the Cure's ""Just Like Heaven"" is killing me over here!)

SIX of my favorite songs: (in no particular order)
1. ""Cherry Cola"" by the Eagles of Death Metal
2. ""The Clap"" by the Unicorns
3. ""The Kids Are All Dead"" by Zombina and the Skeletones
4. ""More, More, More"" by the Andrea True Connection
5. ""That's Life"" by the U.S. Bombs 
6. ""Know It All"" by Lagwagon

FIVE things I'm afraid of:
1. Being betrayed again. 
2. Failing classes.  
3. Car accidents. 
4. Fucking up onstage. 
5. Making female friends angry. I just realized that. If I think I pissed off Amanda or Unalung, it bugs me, but if it's Michael or someone else, then they need to grow up. Weird...

FOUR of my favorite items in my room:
1. My bed.
2. The newest additions to my DVDs via eBay. 
3. My computer. 
4. My Arik Cannon autographed Kool-Aid thingy.

THREE things I do everyday:
1. Walk, either around campus or my neighborhood.
2. Talk to Lori on the phone. 
3. Listen to music. 

TWO things I want to do right now:
1. Wake up with Lori still in my bed. 
2. Forget I have alot of homework. 

ONE thing you are thinking of:
1. How many friends I've lost in the past 6 months, I've made new ones but friendships dying are never pleasent."

First and foremost, Eyes Gotz Mez a New Woman! I had a crush on her for awhile and I suppose I finally had the nerve to tell Amanda Lee (who is friends with her) about it and to see if she could subtly do something. Well, a partially inebriated Amanda told the girl bluntly and after a few nights of her being too scared to answer my calls, she picked up. We went on a date last Friday and I'll just say that it went REAL well! She's super easy to talk to, we've got loads in common, and she's definately not hard on the eyes. So, yes, I'm now courting young Lori Anderson. Go Me! 

I went to a show and after an encounter with a sleazy son of a whore, I saw some rad bands. I'll fill in all of this later... but yes! GOOD TIMES!"

"event","Okay, time to sum up the past two days now that I'm not exhausted. 

Friday: I took my psych re-take and did well on it I think. Access was a breeze as per usual, so I got out of there pretty quick. I found my buddy Shawn in the lounge of the Basic Science Center. We ended up chatting about psychology and why a friend of mine does the things he does. Shawn doesn't even know the guy and almost pin-pointed his behavior. Anyway, long story short, I was on campus from 8:30 in the morning to 7 in the evening. 

It turns out that I didn't get to see Ghost Rider afterall thanks to the tickets being sold out and Devien and Brett disappearing. I did end up going out with Mike and Shawn though. Here's a short discription of Mike and Shawn... two huge rednecks in their 30's. These are my friends at college. Anyway, we were driving around town just cracking one another up with the various ways we could end up abandoning the others. At one point, I looked down to see what my feet were resting on - a sawed off shotgun. NICE! 

We ended up going to Bob Evans to eat and our server was the first girl I ever had a crush on. Yes, kindergarten crushes are so endearing! Anyway, I thought it was kinda funny, but I didn't make it a point to tell her who I was. Sure we went to school from Kindergarten through the 9th grade, but I'm sure that would've been uncomfortable. Dinner was decent, then I went home and crashed after a brief conversation with Taylor. 

Saturday - 

I woke up at 7:30 thanks to my mother. Why? Because I apparently need to cash my paycheck in. Why? I'm not too sure. Anyway, after we did that and ran around for a few hours, it was time for me to go to work. 

We were busy ALL day! Why? Because when the weather forecast predicts snow, people think it's the end of the fucking world! People bought tons of beer, red bull, cigarettes, alcohol, bread, milk, and lottery tickets... you know, the essentials. We also sold a whole lot of coffee! Man, I was making pots ALL day. 

So, now here's a story for you fine children about the people I get to deal with on a regular basis:

For those unfamiliar to my stories, I give a couple of our customers nicknames. Convoy - who sounds and looks alot like that guy who wrote the song ""Convoy"" back in the 70's. Coffee-Bitch - who bitches about our coffee on a regular basis. Now, I add another to the list: Rhinestone Cowboy. 

Now, the Rhinestone Cowboy must've been coming from the country bar down the street, and it looks like he was about to get him some sweet, boot-scootin' lovin'. He comes in, heads directly for the chapstick, and picks up a tube. He brings it to the counter, it's 2.09. I ring it up, it's 2.22 with tax. Now, seeing this slight increase in price, he jumps on my case. ""Excuse me, you don't charge tax for heatlh and beauty supplies."" I responded sharply, ""Yes... we do."" ""No, it's against the law,"" he shot back stubbornly. At this point, I take a quarter out of my pocket and toss it on the counter. ""There's your tax, now give me two dollars and leave."" He obliged, but not before saying that ""in other states they don't charge tax on health and beauty."" Now, I could've drug the argument on for a while, but I was tired and not in a grand mood anyway. The last thing I needed was for a man with a rhinestone-studded cowboy hat to bust my chops over a friggen quarter. 

Anyway, I went home at 10:35, talked to Taylor on the phone, Beth online (who unloaded an arsenal of pro-alkaline trio propaganda because some clod called them sell-outs in her school's paper), spazzed out over something silly, and fell asleep with the lights on... again. 

Today, I promised myself to re-read all of my history chapters because we have a test this week. I also have some Business Comm. work to do and a chapter or two in Psych to read.

"event","So today was incliment weather and this time I could actually get to class... not that I really wanted to. Unfortunately, I had to get to campus an hour before everyone else. So, I sat alone in the business building with only the harmonious sound of the Chikara podcast on my Zune and the quiet snickers I let escape through mildly chapped lips to keep me company. Dr. Snead was late to class and we handed out the Economic tests. I made a B, but I would've done better if I had actually studied. 

I love my Econ class... we're all such smartasses. Snead made a comment about a particular question being one that seperated the 98's from the 100's, and this one guy in the room blurted out ""Or the 60's from the 62's"". Apparently his wife is in the class and he had gotten that particular question right while she wasn't so fortunate. I predict that he's sleeping on the couch as we speak. Snead is apprently a big music fan, and not the cliche professor favorites like the Beatles or Pink Floyd. One of the options on one of the questions was ""Maynard James Keenan"", and I was apparently the only other person in the room besides him who knew who that was. Now, I'm not a big Tool fan, but my Econ professor loves Tool and A Perfect Circle... how rad is that? 

Next was class with H2 and that was surprisingly easy. I talked to Shaina most of the class and H2 talked about presentations. I might do mine on Lucha. After class, Shaina and I talked about random things which we're quite accustomed to. She's interesting. 

I've basically been watching some Pete & Pete (finished both DVDs) since I've been home. I STILL need to write that stupid Psych paper, as well as study for the re-take test. 

Tomorrow I'm going with Devien and Brett to see Ghost Rider after play practice ends at 7. Maybe Kevin too if he can come. 

Speaking of the play, for those who don't know, I managed to score some prominent roles in our campus' rendition of Canterbury Tales - including the narrator. Dr. Carr has set it up to where Kevin and I are constantly interacting. His impressions are great and apparently my body language is parallel. In one story, we're both chickens... worse yet, we're married. 

Anyway, I'm about to head out with Amanda B.'s place to watch a movie... something else I'm using to further delay my homework. Back to the point, I'm out of here for now. To quote the immortal Tigger, ""Ti ti for then, Ta ta for now!""

"event","It's been over two months... two months without the arguments over the phone, two months without the frequent Alkaline Trio conversations, two months without her... without Beth. In the course of those two months, I've talked with and been on dates with a few girls. All range from pleasent times to just god awful. With one girl, all she wanted was the physical side of things. Does it make me a wuss to turn down being someone's fuck buddy? The other girl is playing games with me and I don't appreciate that at all. The other girls... it just didn't click I suppose. 

Beth came in for Christmas break and I managed to avoid her almost the full time. I ran into her once at a show and I acted like a jerk to her. Then I just pretty much blew her off. She felt alone here, she was miserable. She was the only one of her friends at college who came home and didn't have anyone to hang out with. She ended up calling me one night and telling me that she felt like curling up into a ball and crying. So, I agreed to hang out with her and our friends Dave and Brian one night when I got off from work. So, she shows up at Wal-Mart and gives me a hug and kiss on the cheek. I immediately go into jerk mode and get really moody. I felt bad and asked if she could give me a ride home so we could talk. In the course of talking, I tell her just how badly I've missed her as my best friend. We end up chatting over an hour in my driveway, which of course meant I was upset. I eventually get out of her car and walk inside the house. The next day, she wants to pick me up from work again, but this time, we parked in an empty church parking lot. We held hands and held eachother, she laid her head on my shoulder and we talked about ""us"". We ended up driving back to my house and before I got out, somehow we ended up nose to nose... I knew I could kiss her... and I knew she wouldn't have pushed me away. I think she wanted it... but she has a boyfriend now. So I did the gentleman thing and kissed her cheek, she kissed my forehead. The next day she was packing up to leave for college, and she stopped by to see me before she left. As soon as I opened the front door, she wrapped her arms around me tightly. I told her how much I hated saying goodbye to her and she wiped my eyes clean. I held her hand to her car and kissed her cheek, she kissed mine and she got in her car. As she was driving down the hill, i blew her a kiss and she blew one back. 

In the process of all of this, it hit me. I'm still as madly in love with her as I was months ago... and I think she's in love with me. Taylor thinks she's just doing the reckless college girl thing and that when it wears off, she'll come back. I dunno, I don't want to hang my hat on anything... but for once, I think I'm optimistic. 

What a mess..."

"event","So recently I've been talking with this girl and ""seeing"" her so to speak... she's marvelous. It's been a long time since I've had like a real ""crush"" or a facination with someone... and it's a welcomed change. She's a few months older than me, goes to the other college in town, has a job, and has her own apartment with a friend... very different than younger than me, goes to college an hour and fifteen minutes away, plays soccer full time, and has a dorm room. She's so mature and I'm just totally mesmerized by it. What also blows me away is how much in common we have... from hatred of certain foods to movies and even to past relationships. She loves to dress up and look pretty and she's always giggling when I talk to her. She's fiercely independent and doesn't like it when people pay for her at the movies or for dinner. She's very domestic and loves to cook. She also warns me about her commitment issues and her temper... which is always nice to have a warning I suppose. She's shorter than me, has red hair, piercings, and tattoos... all i can say to that is rwar! Gah, what's an ""over-emotional"" (thanks to whoever told her that) like me supposed to do? 

The downside (which isn't so much of a downside persay) is she's very traditional and would like to know me more as a friend before she decides whether or not she'd like to date me. I'm fine with that. I'm a patient person and I think she's worth the wait. I know she likes me and she likes talking to me. I think I have a good shot honestly, so now it's just the waiting game until we can be a little more comfortable around one another in person. I'm not going to lie though, I really like her and would love to be her boyfriend. 

I haven't talked to Beth much, and that doesn't really bother me anymore. I still hate what she did to me, but I hope she finds what she's looking for."

"event","As I sit here alone in my room, fingernails and skin still caked in mud and decayed leaves, I've slowly realized that everything is starting to slow down again. That once magical high is wearing off and now the stunning realization about my current status is really hitting hard. 

I feel sick inside and currently out. Perhaps I'm being over-dramatic, but honestly, who is going to care if I am? Everyone else is outside now... living their lives in the most debaucherous and care-free ways more than likely. I could never understand why someone would be so interested in tearing themselves down from the inside out. I could never understand how my peers could pursue the opposite (or same) sex for nothing more than for some physical need to be met. Are we really all such animals at heart? It's both disgusting and disturbing to watch all of the self-destruction around me, but what's even more disgusting and disturbing is that they are all having fun. Here I am, with my oh-so-precious morals and sincerety miserable and alone on a weekend night. I hate people. I hate how they make me feel so alienated and ill-at-ease inside myself. I've never been sure if people really understood or knew me as well as they think. 

I'm sensitive and I try to hide it, but ultimately it's impossible to do so. I'm tired of giving myself out only to be stepped on. I don't trust many people anymore. I wanted to believe that everyone is good at heart, but I was wrong. Loyalty... faith... trust... all things out of a fairytale that I've tried to make out of my life. I try so hard to be knoble, but have nothing to show for it. Uncertainty and self-doubt frequently grate away at my wits and my nerve and I'm scared of becoming this bitter person who hates everything. 

Who knows... this could all be shit that's just building up inside my own mind. My brain betrays me like that. She couldn't understand how life is like when you're constantly fearing the worst, dreading the worst, and eventually the worst happening because you've been fretting on it so fucking long. I'm tired of being pushed away. It seems as if people are so scared of damaging me that they don't want to take a chance or they want to lay me down gently. Am I really that unstable, people? Do you really have that much confidence in my mental health that you think if you screw me over I'll snap?

Sometimes I think my life would be so much easier if I could just disconnect myself, you know? If there was some way that I could unplug my brain partially so all I think about is work and school. Everything else... thoughts, emotions, dreams... all would be ignored. I daydream too much. I'm pretty sure these days that no one has let me down. I've just played out these fantasies in my head long enough that when things don't go according to ""plan"", I let myself down. 

I suppose one of my better qualities has always been my story-telling ability. Mainly because I have so many stories worth telling. I've told everyone the funny ones. You know, awkward sexual experiences and embarrassing stories from my youth. I'm pretty sure only one or two people have heard the more serious ones. For a kid my age, I've been through alot of serious things that most of you have no clue about. I've never had a near-death experience myself (though I curiously want to have a minor one), but I've seen my fair share. Someone ODing is perhaps the scariest thing you'll ever see. The way their eyes roll back into their skull... the shade of milk white their now cold, clammy skin turns... how their lips turn shades of blue, purple, and black. It's terrifying. We all think that we're young and indestructible, but we couldn't be further from the truth. Once again, I'm probably being over-dramatic. 

See, most of you will be coming in from your exciting Saturday night/Sunday morning, read this, and will write it off as Corey venting his frustrations, and it's true. I honestly am because there is so little positive around me anymore. I don't blame any of you for my current state. You're living your life. I, on the otherhand, have this severe inability to do that. 

Like my profile says, I'm always going to be that weird kid who swears people are staring at him, that when a group of people circle around eachother that they are talking about him, that can't help but doubt the words that come out of others' mouths. There are two people in the world that I trust with my heart. Both live hundreds or thousands of miles away. That's scary for me. I'm sure they are sick of talking to me anyway.

Is it possible to be homesick if you're currently sitting in your own room?"

I imed her this morning and we started to talk about things, then we decided that we'd go on a walk together. The walk started out awkward, but we ended up holding hands and speaking openly to one another. I broke down and started sobbing and she held me. We agreed that we needed a break from the relationship. I told her that I love her with all of my heart and that I'm going to miss her so much. I told her that I knew that there's a part of her that still loves me and she said that there is. We wrapped our arms around each other and I told her that I love her and she said that she loves me too. We started talking about Sam and all of what happened. I found out that she was more mad at him than upset. She told me that he was a terrible kisser after I kissed her. We talked about what all was going to happen and how she still wanted me to transfer to Emory and Henry. She apologized for being a bitch to me on the phone. We talked about what the next couple of months might hold and I told her that I'm going to be there for her. I told her that no other boy will love her as much as I do. 

We walked back to her house, holding hands and laughing at stories. I asked her how she felt about me and she told me that I'm her best friend but she doesn't want a boyfriend right now. She said she needs time alone to figure out what she wants. She told me how much fun it was to flirt around with boys at Horrorfest and not feel guilty about it. It makes since, she's been with me since she was 15 years old. She never got to truly date around... she never got her heart broken. She doesn't wear the rings I bought her anymore and I asked why... she said it was ""freedom."" I said that she put such a negative stigma on the words ""in a relationship"" and being ""free."" She needs time away from me to miss me and everything I've done for her. She needs time away to let her love for me blossom again. 

When we got to her house, I told her that I'd take her out to eat but she said she was already going out with Amanda. I walked her to her doorstep and held on to her the whole time, barely breathing past the shallow breaths that eased the tears out. I told her that even if she doesn't come back that the past 3 years have been incredible and that I was so glad that I shared my life with her. I told her that no matter what happened, a part of me will always love her. We kissed again and again and again. I asked her if this was hurting her as much as it was hurting me and she nodded her head. I told her that I'd always be Upi and not to ever hesitate calling me or iming me or visiting me. She told me she wouldn't. She said goodbye and I told her not to say those words to me. She then said that she'd see me around and I repeated it. I told her that I loved her and she said that she loved me too. We kissed and then I started to walk away. She watched me walk away and I turned around and pointed at my eye, then my heart, and then back at her. She did the same with a smile on her face. I did it again but then held my arms out wide to illustrate how much I love her. I yelled out that I'd talk to her later and that I love her and I gave out a big ""muah!"" She did the same as I walked away...

That was the most bittersweet thing to have ever happened to me. She's so torn. A part of her didn't want it to happen, but then again, she knew she had to do it. She wants to be young and free right now. She was tired of feeling guilty and hurting me by having feelings for other boys. I am so tired for working so hard to make it work. I gave and gave and gave until I had nothing left to give. Shelly told me that we're in the position that in order to move forward, we had to take a step back. 

Beth's happy right now. She feels independent and confident. She doesn't have anymore responsibilty here in Bluefield. Do I think she'll miss me? I know she'll miss me... she'll miss me a whole lot... and I'll be here for her. Or I'll be there for her. I don't know how long it'll take for her to figure out what she wants... some say that she'll be back sooner than I think... and others tell me that she may never come back. I tried so hard to be a man about this today. I didn't want her last memory of me to be me yelling at her on the phone. I didn't want my last memory of her to be the mad her being so cold and unemotional.

It's been about 12 hours since our walk and the uncertainty is what scares me... it scares the both of us I think. She's already imed me telling me about her new piercings and how Sam is being an asshole. It was so odd not saying that I love her before she went to sleep. I know that a part of her still does, but I don't want to push her away. Her still talking to me is a step in the right direction. I dunno how long it'll take, but I'll wait as long as I can. 

I love you with all of my heart, angel.

"event","It's over... she's gone... the shock is still here and the realization is really starting to sink in. She sounded so cool and confident on the phone. ""I don't want to be in a relationship with you anymore."" She says she doesn't love me. She has a crush on a boy down there, but her best friend likes him too. He doesn't want to have one because it'll upset the other and it hurt her. She's been leaving depressing away messages up for him. She has a hickey on her neck from him. She's been so unfair to me. She never wanted to try to keep me. I don't think she ever really missed me. 

I was so angry. I yelled at her on the phone. I told her she had been acting selfish and childish the whole time she had been down there. I told her that she needed to open up more to her friends. I told her that I won't be talking to her for awhile. The anger has subsided and I feel empty... so empty, so hollow. She's my best friend. She saw me through some of the worst moments of my life. I love her with all of my heart. Right now, if she called me and said this was all a mistake, I'd take her back in a heartbeat. 

She's going to be in town tonight for Horrorfest and she'll be here for awhile Sunday. That was really one of the more upsetting parts of this... I was so excited to see her today. Now I don't know if I want to see her. It's going to be so hard to keep my word of not talking to her... like I said, she's my best friend and I talked to her everyday for almost three years.

It would've been three years in December. Maybe it'll still be. Maybe she'll realize that this was a mistake and come back. The could take days... weeks... months... years... can I live with a false hope? 

I miss you, angel. 

Love always, 

Upi"

If you guessed all of my friends and all the schools they are going to, leaving me alone here in Bluefield, WV, than you are correct! God, I'm so alone here. This sucks considerably, but I'm going to try and keep my feelings of depression on the downlow. All I need to do is keep busy and everything will be fine. You know what they say about idle hands, right? 

Yesterday I helped Beth and Rachel move into their dorm. It's a nice place and they should have plenty of fun there in the secluded Virginia valley. I made it through the whole day fine besides a few moments when a tear or two rolled down my cheek, but when it came time to head back to Bluefield without them I lost it. The saddest image I think I may ever see is the moment when Beth waved us off while we drove away. Just thinking about it now makes the tears build up. I know I'll see them sporadically/possibly constantly throughout the year, but the very idea of leaving them there is what hurt. I trust Bethie. I've been in love with her over the past 2 1/2 years. I'll just miss having the ability to ride around town with her all night so damn much. I love you, angel. Muah!

Today I saw ""Accepted"" with Brian, but that was the biggest waste of my time. Don't see that shit. It was a by the numbers teen comedy with horribly under-developed characters. Justin Long was okay as the lead, but the fact that the steps for the story were almost the exact same as National Lampoon's Van Wilder killed his heat. Basically, slacker Bartleby Gaines along with his other misfit friends (athelete with a bum-leg, weird guy with afro, and stressed out girl)can't get into a college because of varying issues. Bartleby's over-whelming dad and the constant doubts of his legit college-bound fat friend doesn't make matters any better. So, you introduce conflict with the dean of the real college and the asshole frat-boy jock, the cast of misfits who think the fake college is legit, and the awe-aspiring speech at the end of the movie to the accreditation board and you have a cliche story! Congrats! Lewis Black couldn't even save this poorly executed drivel. 

Oh, I'll probably be posting movie reviews because I have nothing better to do over the semester, so enjoy!"

www.myspace.com/betteroffdreaming

The song is ""Self Esteem"" and apparently the story is a guy and a girl who dig one another who end up never getting together due to bad timing. The guy always has a girlfriend when she's single and vice versa. Anyway, the music video will be shot at the girl's wedding and the guy is sitting there accepting the fact that she's gone. Very emo, right? Well, I've played a few roles in my friend's short movies and they really liked my work and want me to play the loser guy. I'm playing an emo guy, in an emo music video, for an emo song... how emo. 

Regardless, the director/writer is in the storyboarding stages so I'll have more to update when it happens. Leave a comment if you want a link to my past work in a short film or if you just want to call me emo to help prepare me for the role."

That's the PETA booth... that's a ham sandwich... and that's why I'm more hardcore than you!

Yes, that's Warped Tour and it rained alot. Totally ruined my Magnum P.I. outfit and made me look like trash the rest of the day. Anyway, if any of you folks on my friends list are proud supporters of PETA, the picture was taken for fun. I'm not trying to make a political statement. It was downpouring on us, we saught shelter in the Girl's Garage tent which was right next to the PETA booth. I had a ham sandwich, they were close, and I figured it was too golden to pass up.

Anyway, I saw: The Bouncing Souls (close to front row), Motion City Soundtrack (closer to front row), The Buzzcocks (loved every minute of it), Split Fifty, The Casualties (after wanting to for 4-5 years), Hellogoodbye (why're those guys popular?), and AFI (yes! I finally saw my daddy!). I didn't buy much, but I had fun. I was going to see The Dollyrots, but the rain fucked up the stage they were playing on so they had to cancel. I saw some folks from bands, but didn't feel like making an ass of myself for an autograph or having my picture taken with them. 

Anyway, I'm out kids!"

31. Got a new girl coming over? Your (tidy) bathroom should include clean linen, a box of Puffs Plus, and several full rolls of TP.

30. Don't caress our faces while we're kissing, unless you really, really, really like us. Rachel, 21

29. On a first date, women never order what they really want to eat.

28. Breast augmentation surgery has grown by 257 percent since 1997. The most popular size? C-cup. As if you didn't know.

27. Gain her trust when you're out by calling her at 10 P.M. She'll go to bed content you're thinking of her, even if you're slurping Jell-O shots off some skank's cleavage.

26. Put down the Drakkar and grab a box of Good & Plenty. Women are turned on by the scent of black licorice.

25. At least one of her friends wants to sleep with you.

24. A good but flawed man is a fixer-upper gem, and women love nothing more than home improvements.

23. Every woman is self-conscious about her ass. Tell her you love her ass and you'll see it more often.

22. If you want more sex, tell your girl an attractive woman hit on you that day. Sixty percent of the time, it works every time. 

21. More than half of surveyed females between 18 and 25 would prefer to be run over by a truck than be fat.

20. All women think they're smarter than their partners in some significant way.

13. ""Women appreciate a big penis, but having one doesn't give you an excuse to suck at foreplay."" Elena, 28

12. Studies show women are more attracted to ""macho"" guys near ovulation. The rest of the month, they're drawn to ""good providers,"" otherwise known as chumps.

11. She likes one of your friends.

10. Ugly girls like to hang out with pretty girls because it makes them feel like they're more attractive. Pretty girls hang out with ugly girls for the same reason.

9. The minute she decides she's even mildly interested in you, she starts making mental pictures of what your kids would look like and imagining her first name with your last.

8. Sixty percent of women in the United States color their hair, according to L'Oral (who are obviously hoping they can peer-pressure the other 40 percent).

7. Dated a stripper? Keep your mouth shut, stupid.

6. Rub a sheet of medium-grade sandpaper across your face. That's your five o'clock shadow when you kiss her. Now rub that sandpaper on your inner thigh. (Mind you, were not suggesting you shave.)

5. Female serial killers tend to use poison rather than guns or knives.

4. Foghat's ""Slow Ride"" is not about a trip in the car. Get the hint?

3. The one breakup line she'll never be able to argue you out of: ""I'm sorry, but I no longer have feelings for you.""

2. Buying a present for your girl? She'll hate it (and you) if she finds out you took along another woman to help pick it out.

1. You'll probably never know how many guys she's slept with. The standard lie is five. Which really means about 12.

"event","Saturday night... Beth has gone out with her girl friends to celebrate graduating... Dave and Brian are MIA... I'm here... again. To all my friends, thanks once again for forgetting I exist and leaving home without me. My parents were right when I was 15, I really do have the worst friends. Everytime I run into them out in public, I'm always told how much they miss hanging out with me and how they'll keep in touch. Yet I'm alone 98% of my time anyway. 

but what the fuck do I know? I'll probably get hit by a car anyway."

"event","So, I managed to maintain a 4.0 average for my freshman year. I'm kinda impressed, but at the same time, I'm always being told some excuse why. ""Oh, you're taking easy classes"", or, ""It's just because you go to Bluefield State College."" I finally do something I can be proud of, and people shoot me down again. Thanks alot guys. 

Tomorrow I'm going on a road-trip to and from Pittsburgh, PA with my neighbor and Dave to pick up some cabinets from a library. Sounds pretty lame to just drive up there and back, but I'm looking forward to it. I like traveling. The road is a pleasent place to be when you have the right music to accompany you or the right friends. Regardless, I'm apparently going to be MIA for around 12 hours. 

Everyone is supposed to serve a purpose in life, and I suppose I'm eager to find out mine. Will I be let down, or will I go on to big things? Will I have the last laugh, or am I just kidding myself? Guidance counselors can't do their job, thus why they have it. You show me a good, informative guidance counselor who can not only get you prepared for college, but actually make you feel like you're doing something worth a damn and I'll show you someone who is completely confident with themselves and have no complex of a self-conscious. It's not fair to blame my current discontent on a guidance counselor, but it beats owning up to my imperfections and blaming myself. 

I apologize. I'm in a bad mood and I'm not allowed to take it out on anyone, unlike how many people take their's out on me. It just stuns me that I can do a 4.0 in my first year in college, and people make it seem like I didn't deserve nor earn it. 

I think the next room is haunted. I swear I hear Chuck in there in the middle of the night. I can't muster the courage to open the door and look for myself. Mainly because the noise is somewhat comforting. I miss him and all his wacky hijinks. 

Does anyone else feel the need to live up to the examples their siblings have built? My brother decided he wanted to be a doctor when he was 5 years old. The next 20-some years, he never changed his mind. Now, he's the chief of staff at Logan General Hospital and gets to go on expenses paid trips to all these big cities for seminars, he has tons of cash, and is constantly going on some sort of vacation. My sisters are the same way, made up their mind on a career when they were young and posed for success. I, on the other hand, wanted to be an X-man. Sadly, my 13th birthday came and went and no mutant powers. So, I'm the younger brother of the rich doctor and I have absolutely no idea what I want to do. Well, I know what I want to do... but I've been told that that's intangible like most of my other dreams and aspirations are. 

Once again, I apologize for the bad mood."

"event","Have you ever felt like you were doomed, yet there is a strong part of you that is filled with a large sum of hope? I dunno what I'm feeling or even thinking at this hour... I just feel good. Like, the best I've felt in a long time. I feel refreshed... eager... optimistic. I know you guys won't respond to this because I doubt many of you remember who I am. Dori may respond and she'll call me gay or a faggot and I'll laugh. Dori always has a way of making me laugh. 

People I miss speaking to:

Miss Liz
Innocenty
Dorinator

There would be more, but I'm afraid that I was too busy living through the drama that I was responsible for creating to really get to know the rest of you. I'd still love to hear from you regardless.

I can't say that I'm in a great mood. I also can't say that I'm in a bad mood either. I'm just... here. Here's good for the time being, but I hope to get out of here soon. What I'll do or where I'll stay? I don't know... and for right now, that's okay. 

Much love to my long lost friends and all the lives you're currently leading. I know you're all probably doing wonderful, and even if you aren't, you just haven't realized it yet. That seems really hokey, but I sincerely wish you all the best."

"event","There are so many better, more productive things I should be doing right now; my math homework (that I'm two lessons behind in), doing a revision for my composition essay (which seems like no matter what I do with it, Jhamkhandi will bitch about it, but then proceed to show it off to the class), completing my daily assignments for the efed (which are always nagging ones), and I probably should've stayed in the radio studio to complete ripping the $1,000 dollar cd purchase that Bill made. Whatever I'll be doing for the remainder of the day will, unfortunately, be unimpactful. There will always be more and more assignments and more and more work until the good graces of summer meet me and offer me a much needed care-free break. 

I faced a rather troubling problem today that was caused by my own stupidity and recklessness. For those of you who do not know, I'm straightedge, but caffeine has become my drug of choice. Well, I was in the studio ripping the soundtrack to ""Saturday Night Fever"", staring at the part of the case where the cd is held because Travolta is showing off his grooves decked out in a rather nice looking white leisure suit and noticed that I had a little less than half of my Coca-Cola left. I figured, what the hell, I'd just down it all right now - totally unaware of the dangers that secretly lurked behind the dark brown fizzle. So, I commenced with my dastardly plan and gulped down the tantilizing carbonation. Well, 5 minutes later, my throat feels like I'm gurgling moutwash in my sternum. Then it moves up. So, I have this bubbling, crummy feeling all in my throat that doesn't pass for a good 10 or 15 minutes. Then another problem arose. 

Yes, good friends, I had to piss like there was no tomorrow. I looked down at the clock on the lower left side of the start bar and noticed it was 11 and my ride was here. They (being my family) had made a big deal about me being out at 11 that I had to exit the cd ripping program (after I finished ripping Soundgarden's ""A-Sides"" cd at that point) and headed up stairs. To add to my irritation caused by my slave-driving bladder, my shoes squeaked as I ran down the linoleum floor. The elevator ride was also painfully slow. Finally, I made it to the fourth floor and looked outside to see if my mother's car was there. If not, I could make a kick run to the bathroom and relieve myself of my woes. Not only were they there, the car was parked in the middle of the road! Now I had to go in order for them not to create a scene.

I also ran into my fair share of obsticles on my way home. Between some jackass who didn't know that a green light meant that he could go and stopping to pick up the father of my sister's baby for his visitation day, I was praying for a car accident. Not a bad one, mind you, but one efficient enough that it would make wetting myself understandable. Finally we made it home and I ran to the bathroom. 

Now, I just took about half an hour or so to give my readers a detailed description of me having to piss. The lesson of the day? Don't drink soda quickly because you will regret it at some point.

"event","So last night I served spaghetti for some spaghetti dinner. Well actually, I served the breadsticks...Beth served the sauces, and some gay guy named Stanley served the pasta. Weird night, I got called incompetent by some woman. Oh well.

The most amusing part of the night (Beth refused to admit this) is when we went outside for break. Well, the dinner was served at Bluefield College and we had a good view of the dorms. Well, on the top floor, this one guy was just going full force at his DDR game. Like he didn't stop for 3 hours...it was amazing. Well, after the dinner, the little kids had an urge to play DDR (I have no clue why) so we went to Beth's house and they played in Sarah's room while Beth and I hung out in her room. She had senior pictures today so I helped pick out her outfits. By helped, I mean I nodded and agreed with whatever choice she made. I'm kidding, she looked gorgeous in whatever outfit she tried on. 

We ended up falling asleep in her bed for a little bit and we talked about her going off to college. I'm not scared that she's going to cheat on me, I just know I'm going to miss her a lot and I know it's going to suck a lot before I get used to it. Everything is alright though.

Brett and I have a radio show on the college from 11-12 where we talk about modern rock and play 80's music until our sponser buys us the cds we want. It's a cool gig and we're having a lot of fun with it. 

I want to go bowling with everyone today. 

The weather sucks outside.

Tomorrow is PPV night and I can't wait to have Randy come into my house and cause a riot. I'm kidding Randy. I love watching wrestling with Randy because he gets really, REALLY into it. 

Anyways, I'm bored and I'll probably have to clean up in my room today, which comes as no surprise because it's a HUGE mess. Oh well."

"event","And this guy is creeping me the hell out.

This guy, let's call him Derek, is in my Introduction to Layout and Design class at the college. Before last week, he was a very quiet guy who kept to himself. Well after midterms I decided to create some small talk with this guy by asking him what his major was. Well, instead of answering my question, he went on a rant about how he's a born again christian who owes his soul to the power of God. I nodded and said that was cool and all, but then he started asking me my beliefs. Well, I'll be damned if I'm going to lie to a man who has dedicated his life to God, so I told him I was agnostic. Well that was a dumb thing to do. Soon after he immediately started asking me if I would like it if he showed me the kingdom of heaven. 

Now the sirins in my head are going off. I told him that that was alright, but I'd rather pursue that on my own terms. Well, he smiled, shook my hand, and I left.

This week I had a gameplan, I was going to talk to my professor after class for 30 minutes in hopes this guy would get bored and leave. Boy was I wrong, he waited for me and started asking me again. This time I was honest with him and said that I would really like to find my own answers on my own. Well, he smiled and said that it took him 20 years to do that himself and that Jesus was coming back soon. I honestly had no clue on how to respond. He then grabbed my shoulder and prayed for me asking Jesus to ""make himself known to me and to help me see his path."" I then left immediately.

Now, should I feel like a jerk because this guy is creeping me out?

Next week I'm just going to head down to the studio at the college and practice with the editing equipment. Not only will it help me avoid the guy, it also gives me an excuse to practice with the equipment."

"event","The West Virginia local scene has taken a very big blow. 

Bluefield's hometown hero Argyle Goolsby of, everyone's favorite horror-punk band, Blitzkid will be joining Doyle Wolfgang Von Frankenstein (former Misfits guitarist)'s band Gorgeous Frankenstein. Many of us now believe that Blitzkid's final days are approaching us. I think everyone will agree with me when I say ""Steve, we're very proud of you. Now go out there and make your dreams come true."" Blitzkid's been THE band in the Bluefield area now for about 8 years. The scene won't be the same without them.

Now, one last time, ""Whoa - oh - oh! Nosferatu-u-u-u-u!!!!""

We won't let Blitzkid's efforts to build up our scene die in vain, me along with the others will do our best to make sure it lives on."

My classes are going alright
The family is doing alright

In short, everything is alright.

"event","Well, to those of you who have been reading my lj for the past few years, I've finally done it, I went to Warped Tour. More on that later.

Monday:

Dave picked me up bright and early so that I could help take his dogs to the kennels and one to the vet. Dave has some big dogs. At one point he got out of the car and left me alone with them...they must've smelled fear on me or something because they just walked all over me. I had so much dog hair on me it looked like on of them exploded. After that we headed to the Enigk's where we (The Hudaks minus Ryan and Adam, Ali, The Enigks, Dave, Michael, Brett, Katie, and myself) left for Cleveland. Many hours (and one kickass lunchbreak) later, we arrived in Cleveland and it was so great to be out of a car. We walked over to the mall where I bought a Star Wars shirt with a stormtroopers helmet on it with two bones behind it, and a bloody Misfit shirt. After some more shenanigans, we walked back to the hotel. We ordered pizza, worked on a punkrock crossword puzzle, played frisbee in the lobby, got in trouble for playing frisbee in the lobby, and then went to sleep after rubberband wars and plastic spoon throwing.

Tuesday: 

That morning we got up and got ready for Cedar Point. Well, it was pretty cool and we rode some pretty fucking scary rides (I'm afraid of heights). As soon as we got in ride for the Raptor, though, Dave Matthews Band was playing and Brett said, ""Man, this isn't amusement park music, this is ABUSEment park music."" Brett had me rolling the whole day. Well, after he said that, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes came on so we all sang along and marked out. I found that the best part of the day was when we were in line for rides and we could sing along to songs that were playing. They actually played ""Freebird"" by Lynrd Skynrd the whole way through. We ate lunch and dinner in the picnic area. I bought a tie-dye shirt that says ""The Raptor"" there too. After the park, we drove closer to the airport in Cleveland to stay at the other hotel. We ended up ordering pizza there too. So, two nights in a row we had pizza.

Wednesday:

We ventured into the Body Worlds Exhibit and the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame. Both were pretty cool, but I've never been a museum type. The dead bodies looked like jerky. They let little kids into the rest of the museum, so it's safe to say that the rest of the museum day was shot. Well, we went to the Rock N Roll hall of fame which was pretty cool. I marked out for all the Buddy Holly, B-52, and DEVO stuff they had. I want to see The Who's ""Tommy"" now though. If any knows where I could find a copy, it'd be cool. I bought a Dickies cd in the gift shop because those are really hard to find. We ate another picnic between the two museums and headed back to the hotel for a little while where we went swimming (I swam in a dress shirt and tie). We then went to Rachel's Aunt's house for dinner (oddly enough, more pizza 3 nights in a row). We walked to the beach of Lake Erie from her house and hung out there. Rachel's cousins didn't like me and poured sand in my hair after Dave tackled me (after I tackled him of course). We walked to some ice cream shop later (but right after Michael fell in Lake Erie off of some rocks). Well, I wanted to find some reasonably priced coca-cola in Ohio so we (Beth, Me, Sarah, Ali, Brett, and Katie) walked to a Rite-Aid that was across the street. Well, while there, some crazy woman tried to sell us shirts (she didn't even work there). Well, we ran off to hide in the tampon aisle, well Rite-Aid called security on us (do they even have security?) so we ran into the hair care aisles. Beth and I found some hair dye which we purchased and left Rite-Aid with the others. We walked back to Rachel's Aunts singing ""Ole!"" by the Bouncing Souls and then we stayed at her house until close to midnight. When we got back to the hotel, we ate more pizza and Beth, Dave, and I dyed our hair (Beth did Red, Dave and I did Orange).

Thursday:

WARPED TOUR! We rode the RTA to get there which was awkward because it was full of punks and Cleveland Indian fans. We got there and immediately went to the Hurley stage to see Motion City Soundtrack (we were really close btw). I didn't really care for the band beforehand, but they won me over with their performance. After that we caught a bit of the Matches before me and Beth wandered around aimlessly. We ended up finding our way back to the Hurley stage where the Horrorpops were setting up. We stood there for 20 minutes unril they plugged in (before then, however, the singer for Riverboat Gamblers harassed a fan near us who called them emo. It was quite funny). We were right up front on the barracade when they started. I got so many great pics and Kamilla was playing to me and beth the whole time. She's hysterical to watch on stage. Beth got one of the buttons they threw into the crowd. The Horrorpops were such a fun band who played to us and the rest of the crowd. Well, after them, we tried to see Transplants but I didn't want to stand in a large crowd so we went to the Ernie Ball stage to catch the future gods of ska, Big D and the Kids Table who not only made fun of Avenge Sevenfold, but all the hardcore bands with their performance. They closed their set with L.A.X. which was an awesome way to go out. From then, we waited up front of the Mike Stage to see MXPX for 30 minutes. Well finally they played and it was awesome, everything I expected (even if Yuri seemed a little tired). The only thing i didn't like was somebody headbutted Beth and I was going to go after him. The thing was that it was so damn hot that I was feeling really dizzy so we (our group) stumbled out of the crowd to sit down in the shade. Michael and Katie were also feeling sick so they left. There a guy sold me a cd for his alternative hip hop band. He was very serious and compassionate which is something I admired so I forked out the 3 bucks for the cd (Arcane, it's really good. Check them out if you can). Well we all chilled out for the next hour or so when some rather cool things happened. 1) I was wearing my Raptor shirt and this chick came up to me and told me that she actually operated that ride at Cedar Point. 2) My back was hurting and i wanted to lean against a tree but there was a girl already there and I didn't want to sit beside someone I didn't know. Well, an hour later she asked me if my name was Corey. IT WAS HEATHER! Lol, that was pretty cool. She told me that Liz told her to look out for me. (thnx mommy!) Well after she left, the guys held down the fort under the shade (provided by the fans of Hawthorne Heights who wanted to meet their idols) while the girls went to see All-American Rejects. I watched this Rap group called Bad Fathers who were just these guys in loin clothes rapping. They were pretty damn cool and ballsy at that. Well the girls returned and I attempted to see The Offspring but gave up so we waited for Ali and Sarah to watch Thrice so we could leave. We rode the RTA back to the station, got in the MAZDA and drove back to the hotel where we all went swimming to cool down. We ate pizza (4 for 4 people) and sat around in each others rooms and chilled out. I bought a Motion City Soundtrack shirt, a Warped Tour shirt, a Horrorpops shirt (which I bought from Kamilla), a Big D and the Kid's Table shirt, an Aquabats cd and alot of free shit.

Friday:

We woke up feeling the effects of sunburn (mine turned into freckles) and we didn't go out til around noon. We walked to Dunkin' Donuts and Arbys (which was beside the hotel and was open til 1am so we really didn't have to have pizza all those times). We went to a used book and music store, best buy, and the mall (I didn't really find anything). We went back to the hotel, changed clothes, and went to Max and Irma's for dinner. After that we went swimming, hot-tubbing, I went on a nice long walk with Beth where we had a great, deep conversation. After that, all the guys (Myself, Michael, Dave, and Brett) stayed up all night talking about our opinions and ourselves. It was really educational. 

Saturday:

We all cleaned up, packed the cars, and came back home. Beth and I went to Wal*Mart to develop my film.

So, that was my trip in tons of detail. Good luck and good night!"

"event","I've noticed a trend that's been going on for years now. That trend would be disrespecting your hometown. First off, let me say anyone who honestly hates this place needs to jack off to the thought of moving and leaving the rest of us alone.

Personally, I was born and raised until I was 4 in a small coal-mining town of Coalwood which has been made famous because my cousin and some of his friends made and shot rockets when they were seniors in high school. Well Coalwood is nestled in the hills of McDowell County which has always been poor thanks to the rigid mountains that fill it. I wear the fact that I'm from McDowell county like a badge on my arm. I'm not a big fan of the place, but I respect it for helping my family survive thanks to it's coal mines. Well, there's a few people who share my respect for McDowell and those who refer to it as ""The Giant Hole."" First off, fuck you. Those people work a hell of a lot harder than you currently are/will ever work for a LOT less. Secondly, who said that you are so high and mighty that you can talk down to a whole county full of people because your parents have money? It's a shame, your parents worked their asses off to give you everything you need/want and their parents did the same and all you do is talk shit about the place they grew up in. GET OVER YOURSELF YOU CUM GUZZELING WHORE. NO ONE LIKES YOU AND NO ONE EVER WILL.

Next off, there are people who talk shit about Bluefield. Fuck you guys because you have no idea how much better off you are then compared to the people who live in worse places. I love Bluefield. This place has treated me much better then Princeton ever did. 

Princeton is a place I never cared for personally but it did teach me a few lessons in life I'll enternally be grateful of. For instance, I learned who my REAL friends were whenever I moved. You know how many REAL friends from Princeton I do have? I can count them on one hand. Wanna know how I can tell, they were the people who continued to talk to me even after I transfered. Princeton is a place of opportunities and I can understand why some of you may obsess over it, but never NEVER, talk shit about your hometown. Why? Because, YOUR HOMETOWN MADE YOU WHO YOU ARE AND THERE IS NO CHANGING THAT.

Hell, wanna know why most bands go back to their hometown to play shows? Because they understand this logic. 

GROW UP AND LEARN SOME FUCKING RESPECT."

"event","People change. It's a fact, something that is true and cannot be changed no matter how much we want it to...especially these days. I look at the same people I've been awkwardly gawking out for the past years and it seems that I'm staring at total strangers. My best friends have become my enemies, all while my enemies became my best friends. It's ridiculous how a inocent christian girl can become a booze-guzzling, cynical whore. All the while, a friend of mine who I loved to be around spreads more rumors about me than anyone else. The guy at school I used to despise is now my partner in crime. The girl who I thought was extremely independent now depends on her boyfriend to dictate her moods. The one who solely depended on me has gone out and started her own life. The guy who I thought was childish is now one of my closest friends. The band I swore my allegience to is giving me a headache. The nerdy girl I would playfully tease is now the hysterical girl I playfully tease. People who didn't know me, now go out of their way to talk garbage about me. The happy, optimistic friend is still that optimistic. The guy I knew little about is a good friend. The guy who I hated is fun to be around which makes me realize that I was just jealous. 

Through all of this, the girl I loved makes me love her more and more everyday.

Even I have changed. The loud, blaring street punk i loved now gives me a headache. I gave up the ""tough guy"" fascade in exchange for a more sarcastic, casual one. The clothes are more unusual and less street. The hair is flat and long instead of pointy and vertical.

I miss how things used to be with some people but I know there is no turning back. Those people who I once held so dear are now in my past. To those people, I say my final farewell and tip my hat to you.

""Farewell."" *Tips hat.*"

"event","I've had a rather rough afternoon. Besides dealing with a very important decision, I discovered that a pro-wrestler I used to watch passed away Thursday. Oddly enough, it made me upset, not the fact that he died, but just the thought of death itself. I'm 18 years old. These are the best years of my life, I graduate high school, I'm starting out life...I should be on top of the world. I should think that I'm immortal, but I don't think that way. 

Everyone tells you not to dread on the thought of death, to live for the moment. Hell I've said it myself, but I'm scared of dying. Let me re-itterate, I'm not so much as scared of dying as I am scared of not expirencing the rest of my life. I thought about it and it'd be more painful for me to miss holding Beth, miss my both my niece and watching them grow, never marrying Beth, never having children of my own, never having a job I'll probably hate, never growing old with my beautiful bethie, never meeting my friends Liz, Dori, Laur, and Fluffums, never writing out my scripts and songs, leaving behind my friends. All of those things and more would be more painful to lose than that one moment of pain which is associated with death.

When you think about it, life is fucked up. We're given life and told to live, but at the same time, one bad decision, one screw-up, and it's all over. It's like ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"", you're given the opportunity to accomplish your dreams, but one mistake and it's over. 

Think about that before each and every one of you take the time and effort to hate someone. Hell, you don't even need to do that. I'd just like to thank you for reading this. 

RIP Chris Candido (Too many talented entertainers died this year)

Sincerely,

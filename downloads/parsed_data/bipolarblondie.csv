"event","ya know, after daniel pissed me off so bad, once again i started tryin 2 figure out exactly why ive ""changed"". 4 once i think i figured it out, and so now im positive it has NOTHING to do w/ thenamelessex, so no worries there! n e ways, after my dad died all i wanted was 2 not have 2 think about it every minute of my life, ya know? well the way i delt w/ it was i keep changing my life, 2 kinda escape reality so 2 speak. like, i did things i didnt do when he was alive, like piercings, dying my hair alot, dressin more ""punk"", etc. i guess its my way of movin on and not living in the past. like if things werent the same i wouldnt remember as well and think of it so much. does that make sense 2 yall? i think ive got the room 2 grow now bc he was a protective father and i was his ""lil girl"", so now that i can get away w/ things, im doing it. y not? i guess its kinda like, me b4 was afraid of death and change. so i had 2 change that part of me so that i could deal w/ things and not completely break down. so it has NOTHING 2 do w/ likin ""thenamelessex"" and/or wantin him back (eww) and its not about not being like the southside ppl. (tho that is a total plus) its all about startin my life as the new me, maybe w/o a father, but w/ alot more courage and hope. (tho it sometimes comes off as suicidalness obviously, its not, its just my way of dealing and growin as a peron) maybe im not some clean cut prep of perfection and maybe i dont wanna be like every1 else and i like doin things ppl look at kinda funny, but it doesnt mean im a dif person all 2gether, or that im ""goth"", ""punk"", or ""dark"" (or prep) im just being me 100% w/o a cautious dad afraid ill get hurt or judgemental friends who think goth means u worship satan. im happy w/ my life right now, not fully, i mean, things can always get better, but 4 once im gonna take my pessamistic views and toss them out bc its not about answering 2 ppl who wanna catigorize my life and everythin really isnt as bad at it seems, tho it feels like it at times. its about livin life the best u can and enjoying every minute of it, ur own way, not wut others want 4m u. its taken me years 2 realize i can do things my way and not be an outcast 4 it, and i hate it when preps like daniel try 2 make me think im wrong bc in process of tryin 2 figure this all out i realized im right. tho the mass majority of ppl dont seem 2 think so, 1 day theyll regret not listening 2 wut im saying bc every1 would be alot happier if they were living 2 plz God and themselves and only them. idk, i just thougt id share wut was goin on in my mind right now. let me know if u dont think im completey insane! lol. ttyl.

(i kno it sounds far fetched, but its 2 big of a concidense 4 all their cigs and such 2 b there and trust me, he plays crooked, so its very much like him.) so now im kinda worried, bc i think of them as the lebanon mofia.(not that theyve killed ne1, they just do dirty buisness) they prob work undercover at davids pizza! (lol, sry inside joke w/ my mom...wow, weird, me and my mom have an inside joke!) well ill c yall 2morrow, i promise ill try 2 make it as much fun as possible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ~lots of luv!~"

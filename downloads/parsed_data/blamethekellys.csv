SO ive made it here, WHEW, well i seem to be fitting in just well for a southern guy, the accent helps with women. I miss alot of stuff, friend(s), Family, and even the Dog and our late night smokes. the homesickness didn't really hit me until about 48 hours ago, it really sucks. Don't get me wrong i love my new home here, and everything is within a 10 min drive, sometimes its a lil creepy here though i feel as if i am being watched i think its all those pictures of Jordon all over the place.

looking forward to the new nascar season though.....FEB 11 first race..also my B-day

the other thing that is sad, after writing this i want to reconsider my major (ENGLISH)"

"event","I have been sick (mentally) for about 6 months now, and it has got to the point where I am physically sick too. I have tried to pin in down to one particular reason, I'm pretty sure it's stress, but from there I cannot narrow in down is it parents? the relationship between my friends? This Nicut shithole, women, but I could never quite get down to the problem, until today, it's my friends, not them personally but shit we have to go through. the only way to get through this is to face that its just gonna happen and get on with it.

<Problems> heres something yall need to know.

       As we all know the key to (good) problem solving is to, well I guess establish the problem, confront it: cry it out, guys this is not always a wimpy way out sometimes a man has to cry. And lastly GET OVER IT, don't make your problem an ever occurring thing, that's not cool, it not only hurts you but the people around you.

       I have been hurt so many times in the past by women, not just me but my friends, When they have troubles its not just them, I go through pain also, so its not very fair to not get over it, your not only dragging down yourself but your friends also. If you love them get over it for their sake.

(NEVER< EVER TRY TO DRINK, OR SLEEP IT AWAY, drinking will truly just sting the problem and it will bite you ever harder later.)"

you don't quite no why

I think their out to get me

I slowly pull aside to ask what have I done

Maybe one, two, three, miles over
I laugh, FUK OFF and give him the shoulder

I drive off pissed off as hell 
knowing in my heart I'm headed to jail
we race down those four lanes of road
As i find myself tripping and slowed
thinking to myself tonight is the night
oh my god, ty's Mom was right

all of the shit that has happened to me
will finally end on forty eighth street
I slam on my brakes, check the rails
tonight is not the night, i won't go to jail

I turn onto those rusty tracks
forgetting the world and not looking back
i hear the sound of a whistling train
the only thing on my mind is if I will feel pain

the cops stop, they don't understand
why would he do this for only a ticket, or a band
but what they don't know it that I know
they way that my life has been and will go

I close my eyes and only wish
if I could have one more unselfish kiss
from the ones that screwed me over so many times
I choose death, but not for this petty crime
but for the shit in my life that all fell through
no one knows what shit makes us do.

so all in an instant i screech on my brakes
fire, deceptment, anger and, other opposites of grace
I hold my head up hi so that i may see
this quick death chance, life has given to me

my life is now gone, good for me
just sad for all of my friends or who used to be
i wish there were more about me to be said
maybe there is, once more fuk life I'm better off dead"

"event","Have you ever wondered why women you see out at 
bars,nightclubs,malls and restaurants sometimes dress so damn sexy?

   It's an interesting question.

   I mean, let's think about it from the woman's point of veiw...

   An attractive woman gets attention from men all 
the time... no matter WHAT she's wearing right?

   Attractive women don't have to ""buffup"" their beauty 
in order to attract men.

   And the question becomes very interesting when 
you consider that often it's the most beautiful women 
that go to the GREATEST lengths to buffup their beauty.

   You know what I mean...

   A perfectly beautiful woman gets an expensive operation 
to make her one or two cups larger

   A tall, stunning girl spends all day at the mall 
shopping for just the right high-heeled shoes

   A naturally beautiful woman spends hours in front 
of the mirror getting ready to go out... and puts 
on tons of makeup, Girls men really don't care for 
lots of makeup some of my greatest moments out with 
a Kelly, she had little or no makeup on.

   Anyway,FOR WHAT?

   Could it possibly be worth all the extra time and 
effort... spending HOURS and HOURS to get that ""buffup"" 
of beauty, when a woman already has ""more than enough""?

   Hey, no one ever said girls made SENSE.

  (Don't get too excited. Men have their strange points as well.)

   Let me tell you about a few of the reasons why I think 
women go to these lengths to squeeze that ""extra little 
bit"" out of their beauty


To Maximize Her Strengths In Order To Attract The Best Man

   Let's turn this picture around, and look at it 
from another direction.

   Let's say that an attractive woman is getting 
ready to go to a party.

   There are going to be like a hundred men and a hundred 
women at this party (I know, I know... you think that 
I must be smoking something... because most parties
have 100 men and 10 women... aka sausage fest 
but humor me here for a second.

   If there are going to be a hundred men at this 
party, it follows that a few of those men are going 
to be the ""best"" ones.

   Do you think this particular woman is going to 
want to settle for one of the ""random sausages"" running 
around?

   Nope.

   She wants the ""best"" one... if possible.

   And that guy has OPTIONS.

   Soooo... she needs to ""fix herself up"", EVEN THOUGH 
SHE'S ALREADY BEAUTIFUL... if she wants to have the 
BEST chance of getting THAT guy.      

----------------------------------------------------------------
Competition From Other Women

   This  idea was one of the most interesting 
and surprising things I learned about women while 
I was teaching myself about dating and attraction.

   Here's the deal:

   Attractive women tend to be VERY, VERY competitive.

   A few years ago, I was introduced to a concept
 called ""The Bitch Look"".

   Here's what it is

   When a ""hot"" woman walks into a room, EVERYONE 
checks her out.

   The ""sausage"" looks her up and down with a ""let 
me get a really good look because I'll be using me 
as a spank-it later.

   The ""top guys"" who have options glance at her and 
make a ""mental note"" to talk to her later.

   The OTHER hot women look at her and give her... 
yep, you guessed it.... THE BITCH LOOK.

   Why?

   Because other hot women are instantly seen as 
COMPETITION.

   A hot woman doesn't want OTHER hot women competing 
with her for the ""best guys"".

   So they give other women ""bitch looks"".

   It's competition, intimidation, and millions of 
years of evolution all rolled up into one special 
package.


   So let's just say that attractive women DON'T LIKE 
COMPETITION.

   In order to MINIMIZE their competition, they FIX 
THEMSELVES UP... and emphasize their good points TO 
THE MAX.

   When an already-beautiful goes to the trouble to 
pick out just the right clothes... the ones that flatter 
her figure... and put on just the right makeup... 
in a way that draws attention to her finer points... 
and styles her hair... in a way that draws attention 
to her and frames her face...

   ...it puts her ABOVE the competition

--------------------------------------------------------------
(Almost Done, I promise)
To Get The Most Attention And Approval

 I want to talk about the one reason 
that has the most VALUE to me...

   This reason holds the secret of actually ATTRACTING 
beautiful women.

   At the very CORE of human psychology and behavior that 
coach followell taught,are the twin concepts of 
ATTENTION and APPROVAL.

the basic formula goes like this:

   If you get more attention from others, and those 
others like you more, then you and your offspring 
are more likely to survive and pass on your genes 
to future generations.

   I didn't think that made sence when I first heard it so
I'll say it this way: 


   If others of your species DON'T like you and don't 
give you any attention, you are going to have a hard 
time finding a mate... and reproducing.

   And if others don't like you, then you aren't going 
to have the benefits that come from the group... like 
protection, love, ect.

   It just so happens that an attractive woman has 
an VERY accurate indicator of whether 
or not ""the group"" likes and approves of her...

   It's the amount of ATTENTION she gets.

   If a woman is getting a lot of attention, it keeps 
her feeling ""OK"". She knows, at a deep level 
that she's accepted by the group... and that she's 
going to stay healthy, and have a good chance of mating 
with a ""top male"".

   But this particular concept has a DARK SIDE to 
it (don't they all?).

   Just like anything else that triggers feelings/emotions 
(very addictive chemicals, ""McCullie Ullies""), attention and approval 
can lead to a literal ADDICTION.

   It's like money, fame, power... all the famous 
ones... YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH.


   If you're a beautiful woman who is always getting 
attention and approval from men, and you meet a man 
who DOESN'T give you that attention and approval, 
it has an INSTANT and POWERFUL impact.

   Further, if the man you're interacting with actively 
AVOIDS giving you attention... and gives you DISAPPROVAL, 
it can have the effect of instantly SCRAMBLING YOUR 
SYSTEMS.

   Attractive women don't meet a lot of guys 
that could care less about her beauty... and, instead, 
see it as a ""cover up"" for some ""hidden"" thing

--------------------------------------------------------------

   If you want to learn how to ATTRACT these ""unusually 
beautiful"" women, then you need to get a clue about 
what creates the idea in her mind that YOU are one 
of the most ""desirable"" men.

How, its fukin hard.

1. Become rich and famous.

2. Get plastic surgery to look like Brad Pitt.

3. Trigger ATTRACTION inside of her.

   Here's the interesting thing about triggering ATTRACTION:

   When you do it, she can't CONTROL it.

   If a woman starts feeling ATTRACTION for you, I'll 
guarantee you that she didn't ""think about it and 
decide to feel it"".

 ----------------------------------------------------------------
Every man has their strong and weak points if your funny
be funny, if your not, don't try to be, and in the end hopfully
they give you all their attention and approval...hoping that you will give some in return.

Good Luck in lust, there is no love."

Hummmmmm,

The most attractive and interesting women seem 
to be attracted to men who don't treat them very well?

the ""nicer"" you are to a woman the more she 
often seems to act like ""just a friend"" to you?

  
  Here's the deal(I think): Women aren't usually romantically
attracted to ""Good"" guys. Women are attracted to men 
who are funny, confident, and mysterious. Good looks 
don't hurt 2 much, but if you're not 6'4"" tall and model-handsome like me(LOL), then you have to learn how to attract women with your personality or lack of in some cases.

  And being ""nice"" isn't going to do it for you.

""Motley Crue"". Remember those guys? wish I could forget

  In case you didn't know, the guys in Motley Crue 
are not nice. They're famous for taking every 
drug known to man, beating their women, fighting, and 
having a lot of people die around them.

""Yea, but they're rich and famous...""

  And this is true, they are rich and famous. But, 
and it's a BIG ONE... all of the women that they have 
dated, married, and beaten up are ALSO RICH AND FAMOUS 
TOO!

  These are supermodels and playmates of the year 
and such. These women can date whoever they want. 
Tommy Lee (not Edwards) was MARRIED to both Heather Locklear AND Pamela Anderson...>< remember?

  These women didn't need Tommy Lee (not edwards) for his money 
or his fame... they're dating these guys for some 
OTHER REASON!

  Are you with me on this? (problebly not) TY

  So what's going on here? And more importantly, 
how can you use this information.

  First of all, don't go out and start taking drugs 
and beating up your girls. I mean, I know that an 
occasional woman will drive a man to drink,or in my case smoke as I do so, but I don't recommend going beating anyone.

  Women Don't Make Sense


Women make decisions very, very quickly I have found, about whether a man is going to be ""just a friend"" or if he has 
romantic thoughts, and once her decision is made, 
it's probably going to stay made.

These decisions are made ""unconsciously"", meaning 
that women make all of them quickly and at a ""gut 
feeling"".

If you know how, you make her feel attraction feelings 
rather than ""friend"" feelings.

The way to do it is to stop acting ""nice"" and start 
acting, well... something else... and I don't mean 
""not nice"".
---------------------------------------------------

  At the beginning, I mentioned three things: 
Funny, Confident, and Mysterious.

  Before I talk about each, I first have to remind 
you that BITCHES DON'T USUALLY MAKE SENSE. Remember 
that.

  For most people, this takes some time and practice.
But once you ""get it"" then you can do it anytime you 
want.

  At first it's very confusing but follow Levee on this one, You have to try things that don't seem to make sense. But once you get the hang of it, then 
you see how it works and can make it work... just 
like backing up a car.

  As much as many women would hate to admit it, there's
something very attractive about a man who is just a 
little more confident than he should be. And if you 
combine this with the right amount of humor( thats humor not stupid remarks such as driving up and yelling ""wanna Breed"".) 
, you have Will a magic combination that will charm almost any woman.

  This is what I use it works 60% of the time every time. 

When you first meet a woman, tease her about something.
It doesn't matter what it is, as long as you do it early on. 
For instance, you might say 

""So what's with the big 
purse? Are you carrying a gun in there?""  

""Those are some pretty tall shoes, what are you like 4' tall 
without them?"" 

If you tease a woman, it shows that 
you're not intimidated by her, and that you have a fun 
sense of humor. Make sure you say something FUNNY. 
If you don't know how to be funny. theres no hope. 
If she's not laughing, then it wasn't funny!

Look  at  stuff and seem kind of pre occupied 
when you first start talking to her. Make your funny 
remarks with a carefree,i don't give a fuck tone. You want to 
sound like you're talking to your best friend. Attractive 
women are approached all the time. It's not attractive 
to a woman when you look like you've just met a Kelly. 
This ""just a little too confident"" attitude is very 
attractive to women... especially when it's combined
with humor.

Don't answer her questions directly. Women love 
to ask questions like

 ""What do you do?"" 
""Where do you live?"" 
""Tell me about your family"". 

Answer with funny answers, and don't give her what she wants. 
Most guys say ""Oh, I'm an engineer"" or ""I'm a stock 
broker"". BORING,BORING. If she asks what you do, say 
""Oh, funny you should ask. I'm a Calvin Klein Underwear 
Model... What do you do?..."" 
Just Keep it up and keep her laughing.

  It's important to remember that I'm not telling 
you to be mean, or to be a jerk to women. I'm telling 
you to start being confident, funny, and mysterious

Oh and also, when I say mysterious, I don't meen in a child rape'st way eather.

Peace Out
                                     Levee"

DDS is the worst possible thing you could have. I think i have to teach myself not to drink as much, when i'm having a bad day, which is really hard because what do you uasually do when you have a bad day? oh yea, DRINK. I'm not a drunk i do know that i have a gift at drinking, when i tell myself i've had to much i can stop, a Lot more people need to do that.i'll talk more about this later.gtg"

"event","This past week I have learned a lot about myself, I was raised in a strong Christian (Baptist) home with 2 wonderful Christian parents, who raised me to their best. I grew up in Church, when I was 17, I was already a church administrator, that lasted for about a year, then I moved on to youth minister for about 7 months. I now realize, after studying the bible, history, and mythology that ""it"" is bullshit. I'm not saying that I rule out God but I don't think the bible is at all true, just meant to scare laws and orders into your head. This past week I have become a complete stranger to religion, I have grown to learn when we die, we Die, we are no more! So I'm not going to waste my life over some bullshit that's not true. I have learned That it is essential to have fun in life, the kind of fun that your always told about but ""Christians"" can't do, I like to Drink now, I never thought I would ever drink. I enrolled in the University of Oklahoma, Never thought i would do that, I have had more girls in the past 3 months than ever at one time, Never thought that would happen, life without God seems to be so much better, I get along with my friends so much easier, actually me and my parents fight less, it's all because I'm not so fixated on God and what he wants from me, and to think some poor cunts give up their entire lives to fulfill his wishes makes me want to cry for their soul. No more prayer for me, instead my religion are my friends I do not put GIRLS, MONEY, OR EVEN (g)od above my friends. the Best thing you could ever earn in your life are friends, and I am thankful every day that I have my friends, if I didn't this life would have ended a long long time ago."

"event","I think that the problem with some of my friends is that they whine like a whipped Bitch. 

Women can smell a ""victim"" attitude 100 miles away, and it IS NOT ATTRACTIVE. 

Women's ""standards"" are just fine. 

The problem isn't them, it's YOU. 

Now do yourself a favor and quit ACTING like a little girl, and DO SOMETHING about your situation. 

What, do you think that all the average and ugly guys out there who have HOT girlfriends are getting them by being ugly? 

The answer is ""No, they're not"". 

These guys are getting the babes because they know how to make the women feel ATTRACTION. 

Trust me, I know quite a few guys who are NOT exactly the picture of ""handsome""... but these guys get a lot of women. 

Why? 

Because they KNOW HOW. 

Now quit whining, and go LEARN."

All this boils down to is laziness and i'll admit it i have tried it before. who hasent? I have several friends that have, MOST of them failed 9 out of 10. ""literailly"" also the people that do, do it lie 60% of the time thats more than half for you cunts that can't calculate right. the point i'm trying to make here is that when you try it make for positively sure that the person you are talking to is not a 44 year old lee whitish child porn loven cunt, trying to suck your balls. (unless thats what your into) and the next and final point being, Americans (including me) are stupid and lazy.

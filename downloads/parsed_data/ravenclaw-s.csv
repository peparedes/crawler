"event","Today will be a great day.

I have to keep telling myself that.

But we all know how it really is.

Wake up late.

Drag around the house trying to wake up.

Cold shower, because of course, the hot water is all used up.

Look around the house for the evasive keys. 

Finally, the car is speeding down the road, carrying you to a destination that you know you don't want to go to.

It's like this everyday - or so it seems. 

No rest.

No relaxation.

No release.

Just struggle, struggle, struggle. 

All I need is a good nap. :)

In other completely irrelevent news...

   I finished Cirque du Freak #5: Trials of Death. Great book! I highly reccomend the series. Derek is moving in... I have a giant scratch on my face... I'm sick of... well, pretty much everything... school is going quite well... and I get to go to Disney World in a few months! YAY!"

I like him so much.

He already knows that.

I told him.

I wish things were different.

I must play the cards I've been handed.

Though I find it hard to do, I must hold my head up and carry on. 

I'm so hopeless.

"event","Yeah the dance was fun, but it did have some downfalls. Thanks for convincing me to go Horacio. I'm kind of ticked right now. I don't want to talk about it though. Everyone's kind of ticked actually? That's odd? Well I went to Steven's house last night and that was fun, but then again I just feel ticked off. Well whatever. This saturday night is Coffee House! It's like a night where we watch a movie, then hang out, maybe have like a small service or something. It's at church so there's most likely to be a church service in the middle. We're going to watch Napoleon Dynamite! It starts at six and ends at nine thirty. I'll be passing out fliers on Tuesday hoping someone can come, it'll be a lot of fun."

I walked like five seconds but thats because I was walking with anthony. Ha! Anthony said we shouldn't walk because the coach has spies watching us. Andrew got us all to sign his petition, hopefully they'll get the Dominoes pizza back. Good job on finding an event Bri!"

I couldn't stand straight, or think. Ugh. Horacio was giving me all these tips, thanks Horacio. I need a science project idea soon, but I can't think of one! Ugh. Mrs. Monette always takes Kyle's side. It's gay! She says that just because Kyle's not a cool kid, we shouldn't pick on him! What the heck! He runs in the halls, eats in the classroom, cusses thinking hes cool! I mean come on!"

"event","Daniel, and Lugo should never play basketball again. They suck! I was the only person on are three man team that could score. Oh my gosh, Mrs. Monette played this horrible trick on me. I was talking a lot so she said I had to stay in the classroom five minuets after lunch. I obviously didn't stop talking so it came out that I had to stay in twenty minuets after lunch. Well lunch time came and she asked me if I had any real friends. Then she asked the class, who will stay twenty minuets in the classroom with Patrick? Only Anthony H. and A. stayed. It all came out that she was playing a trick on me. I guess thats what I get for spilling her salad all over the floor. In band Mr. Lara handed me this gay trombone. He said I needed to oil my slides more. But this trombone was like oiled over and over again because when I'd go to a C my slide would like fling across the room. In math Sierra was telling me and Bri that we were matching, and we both looked down at the same time, then we'd look up and say how at the same time. It happened like two times, it was funny."

"event","Ahh..Alright.So.I've been at the hospital really late..all day for the past 3 days because of my grandfather.I'm getting tired.I took today as a break day.My arm hurts and so do my knees.My knees gave out twice at bowling yesterday morning.That's why we left early.I dunno why my arm hurts.I'm thinking that I am just going to stop talking for no reason.Just never say a word like those people in the movies who don't speak for years but then one day speak..like that.I'm also hungry..but no food..It sucks.SO yeah."

"event","Hey.I just realized.Music is really important in my life.I listen to my fav songs like..a million times a day.I'm not obsessed..I just love music.My friends tell me I can sing.and I love to sing.I want to become famous for my music.But the music life is too hard.You have to be on the rode all the time and away from your friends and family..even though music is my dream.I'd never leave my friends and family like that.My all time fav song is Lips of An Angel by Hinder..if you couldn't tell.I listen to that song almost all day.I love to just be free..and not held up..Maybe if I write my music..and sit it for people in clubs or in stores or something..maybe people will like it..I dunno though.I miss everyone from my school..and I hope my grandfather,who is in the hospital, gets better soon.they say he isn't doing too good.I swore to myself..the first time he was in there for a broken hip.I swore to myself and god..if he took him from us.He'd take me too.He let me keep him the first time..but by the way it's looking now.I dunno if he will let me keep him this time.I haven't seen him.since he has been in the hospital. and I really want to.I miss him.My uncle was found guilty though it is only for the moment.He has over 120 witnesses for his side.they have none for the other side.Our whole family is going to be witnesses.The court should know that.My uncle deserves better than that!!Court sucks!!!"

DODGE

Drop your guard
let it fall
i Love you babe
But my god doll

Dodge the knife
I throw at you
Dodge the knife
that went all the way through

You didn't show
you broke my heart
I should have given up on your
from the start

But you proved me wrong
that you do care
though you love
to have girls stare

I miss you
you don't miss me
I'm done babe
I'm setting myself free
___________________________

I DON'T KNOW

I still feel those feelings
I felt before
My heart has sank
and hit the floor

You told me it was nothing
but I don't believe
I still don't know
from what I see

I wonder where I stand
or if what you said was true
I don't know
if you are still you

I end this poem
with a goodbye
I end this poem
because I don't know where I lye
________________________________

CONFUSION

One morning
you see
one morning
I'm finally free

You broke my heart
it split in 2
I guess I was right
I never had a chance with you

You make me listen
to songs over and over again
I want this feelings
To finally end

the feeling of sadness
the feeling of confusion
I want the happiness feeling
to move it

you don't want to talk to me
I guess I can't deny
maybe it's finally time
we say goodbye

you will always have
a place in my heart
even as friends
like from the start

one morning
you see
onemorning
you set me free

You pulled the trigger
and let me die
you pulled the trigger
we said our goodbyes

You make me smile
you make me laugh
time is up
it has finally passed

We said our goodbyes
the poem is over
I'll find someone else
to help me recover
_________________________

DAMN YOU

You steal them
youi take them away
you remove me
whenever they come to hang

I try to hide
how much it hurts
I want my own friends
for who I don't have to search

You steal them
when they come over
They just hang with you
I go under cover

I hide the pain
and the saddness too
you hurt me so much
I'm finally through

You claim it's not your fault
but we know the truth
you always say
it's not because of you

wondering if you're right
if I'm not worth a thing
what if you are 
no one wants me for anything

what if I told you
you were not right
that your just there
but they are just holding on tight

I hate you
you should die
I love you though
SO I will try
_____________

that is most of them..enjoy"

"event","I'm back!!I just got back from the beach like almost and hour ago.It was fun.The first night.We get on the boardwalk and went to Tony's pizza and had a good ole time.Saw a belly dancer.made me mad because I don't look like she did.The second day.We spent the day on the beach..then went to the pool then showered and went out to drivearound and eat and then roasted marshmellow and put them on gramcrackers and everything.Fun.Today was the last day. and we just went to eat and shop around.I got 2 t-shirts that say"" It's ok to be ugly..but you are seriously over doing it"" and then ""If I want your opinion I'll remove the duct tape from your mouth""So fun.I got home after sitting in trafic for like...FOREVER...but fun.I walked in my house because I had to pee really bad and my doggie attacked me.I went to the bathroom and she jumped on me and licked at me and happily growled.It was fun.I really enjoyed it.Hope I go again sometime.But now it's the week Kyle is suppose to come home on Thursday and I have to wait.He's only here for 3 days..and I bet he is going to spend most of it with my brother Jeremy because he probably is going to.He can only hang saturday and he will probably most likly only wanna hang with him.So I don't see what the point in waiting for him is anymore.I just dunno anymore.It's confusing.I got my bestfriend a keychain that says""Worlds bestfriend award"" For always being there through the good times as well as the bad times but most of all for being a friend"" and I'm giving her one of my 4 necklaces.It's all good.but over all.I had fun."

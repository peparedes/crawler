"event","So I left my old college. It's a private liberal arts school that prides itself on small class sizes, diversity, and great learning opportunities. Of course, they don't like to let people know that the students leave with some of the biggest debts in the US. Nor that the students have been surveyed and are some of the most unhappy students in all US colleges. But they're not going to tell you any of that.<br /><br />I transferred to a Cal State college. It's no UC but it's still a great place.<br /><br />The class sizes? Even with over 13,000 students, my classes are still small. We're talking anywhere from 15 to 30 people in a class. The student faculty ratio is 17:1.<br />The people? I see students of many colors, with many languages being spoken, and many cultures blending. Sure, there probably aren't students from Egypt and Bulgaria and whatever, but there's a lot of diversity. It's the <em>San Francisco Bay Area</em>. That's how it works. And people are much easier to get along with. At my old college, many students were stuck-up, in cliques, or judged based on money/material objects and little else. I mean, it's still around at my new place, but it's now the minority, not the majority.<br />The learning opportunities? Dude, it's been <em>so much better</em> than my old college. There are more professors dedicated to teaching (not to furthering their own careers), a larger variety of classes, and much nicer facilities.<br /><br />And best of all? IT'S SO MUCH CHEAPER. And that's including my books and transportation (I'm a commuter student).<br /><br />So I'm drawing my conclusions based on one private liberal arts school and one Cal State school. All I'm saying is: the people at my old college are getting <span style=""color: rgb(255, 102, 0);""><strong>SERIOUSLY&nbsp;RIPPED&nbsp;OFF</strong></span>. Why does one school with a $45,000+/year bill end up being inferior in so many ways to another school with a $4,000+/year bill? Huh?<br /><br />Okay, yeah. That's a biased statement. This whole post is biased. But seriously, there's a reason why my old college has such a high rate of people transferring out. BECAUSE&nbsp;IT&nbsp;SUCKS, BITCH. *middle finger*<br /><br />"

"event","Just some stuff that keeps me up at night.<br /><br />What's the point of life? Not to sound wangsty or anything, but in it's simplest definition:&nbsp;we're born, we live, we die. Is that it? Biologically, we're supposed to pass on our genetic material by means of offspring. I guess everyone that chooses not to (or cannot) procreate goes against that, though. Our most basic instincts call for air, nourishment, shelter, and... that's about it. Obviously, we as humans crave more than that. We need socialization, satisfaction, whatever luxuries we can get our dextrous little fingers (and advanced thumbs) on, and a meaning for existence. I figure that we as a species cannot or will not figure out why we're here. Simply put:&nbsp;we're here because we just <em>are</em>. We can question it all we want, but it doesn't look like we're going to figure out why in a while.<br /><br />Maybe we're just incapable of knowing why we exist. We'd go mad or spontaneously combust or get smote or something. It could be beyond anything our minds could grasp, much like how less complicated species just don't have the capabilities of sentience. I don't want to get any religion or science or other controversies into this, because it all boils down to &quot;we have no fucking clue.... yet.&quot;<br /><br />So what's my point here? I guess it's along the lines of using every chance that you're given to do your best. Yes, yes... &quot;live to the fullest&quot; or &quot;live like there's no tomorrow&quot; and such. People don't really do that, now do they? Stuff gets taken for granted, people settle into mediocre jobs and lives. I mean, who really goes out and truly <em>lives</em>?<br /><br />What's the point of life if you're not really living?<br /><br />I'm not saying that your life is meaningless because it's boring. I'm saying to go and do something you love. Go truly <em>live</em>. Learn a language, volunteer at a local [insert non-profit place of choice here], save up for that trip to [insert dream vacation], find old friends and rekindle that good relationship.<br /><br />Notice all the little things in life. The intricate systems of veins on a leaf, the shifting clouds sliding across the sky, the twittering and chirping and warbling of birds, the gentle and uplifting flower fragrances, the sand shifting under your feet as the waves rush over... There's beauty if you look. I'm fucking serious, no corny jokes.<br />Now go do something about that beauty. Preserve it, teach people about it, share it with others, improve it, fix it, whatever. Even if it's something seemingly small, it adds up. It's nice enjoying yourself while making a difference. The good karma doesn't hurt, either.<br /><br />So yeah. Don't just live your life like a faceless, emotionless meatbag. Go do something wonderful. If you can't find meaning to your life, <em>give it meaning</em>.<br /><br />If you can improve one person's life -- just <em>one</em> -- you can be satisfied knowing that your life made a positive impact on the world.<br />"

"event","Let me ask all of you a question:&nbsp;why are so many people so inconsiderate? It's obviously easy to be indifferent, but isn't there guilt or fear of rules or <em>something</em> that brings people to action? And there's the people who go out of their way to be complete jerk-offs. <em>What do they get out of that? </em>I will never understand finding joy or entertainment from making life harder for someone else.<br /><br />So what is the state of human nature, anyway? I wish I could say that it's positive, but it's probably more neutral than anything else. Obviously there's good and bad, but due to the way averages work, it slides back to the middle. Not that it's bad. I mean, balance is what everything naturally tends to go toward, whether it's equalizing temperature in two adjacent rooms or how people space themselves out in a crowded elevator. Okay, weird analogies. It's pretty late, after all. Which brings me to why the fuck I'm still up at this hour:<br /><br />Do self-centered people really think they deserve more? Are some people really so egocentric that they feel that other people are privileged to get the chance of interacting with them? Do they think the world owes them something? <em>Seriously??</em><br /><br />I don't know why I let it get to me. Obviously I know why it angers and frustrates me. I just don't know why it keeps me up at night. Maybe it's because there's so many of these types around me, meaning that some of them run things around here. Well, not &quot;here&quot; as in &quot;where I am&quot;. More like... &quot;here&quot;&nbsp;as in &quot;wherever you want to talk about&quot;. Self-centered people with power is worse than stupid or ignorant people with power. At least the latter kinds aren't motivated by greedy urges and wasteful thinking.<br /><br />My God, it's also the thought of the waste and the unbalance that keeps me up at night. Not just wealth and money, but all kinds of other resources. How something is taken for granted and ignored in one place, and somewhere else it's a rarity, a luxury, a Godsend. How egocentric people tend to have been raised privileged and how some couldn't even imagine the horrors and hardships that others deal with all the time. How someone can bitch about the perfect cut of a steak, where elsewhere someone had to kill their only source of milk and labor to prevent starvation. One person's shoe doesn't have the right logo or style, where someone else is lucky to have rags to wrap their feet in. Even complaining is a luxury. If something so horrible is a part of your life, there's no time to waste by sitting around and bitching about it.<br /><br />...I just shifted from egocentrism to imbalance, waste and need, and... shit. Okay, my brain isn't working at an acceptable level anymore. I'm going to sleep.<br /><br />"

"event","STRONG LANGUAGE AHEAD.<br />STRONG OPINIONS AHEAD.<br />INTENSE RAEG AHEAD. &gt;:U<br />EPIC FAIL OF INTERNET EXPLORER AHEAD.<br />FAIL BEYOND ALL REASON OF EXCITE E-MAIL AHEAD.<br /><br />YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.<br /><br />*******************<br /><br />I got sick of a forum I was on, so I decided to move to a new one. I finally find an intelligent one, so I register. For some reason, I had a really, <i>really </i>old e-mail in auto-fill. I guess I had used one of my old junk accounts for something. Yeah, a junk account. Back in the day, before &quot;disposable&quot; 10-minute mail accounts existed, we actually had to make our own. Anyway, it's so old, it was with Excite mail. <i>Yeah. </i>Older than some of the kids on the internet nowadays.<br /><br />So that ancient thing is in the auto-fill for e-mail and it has the bad luck of having the same username as an e-mail account I actually use, save for the &quot;@site.com&quot; thing at the end. I didn't double-check, hit send, and basically just fucked myself over pretty hard.<br /><br />I spent the next 15 minutes waiting for my activation e-mail. Nothing. Then I went in to get it resent. They didn't recognize my e-mail, then it dawned on me. Fuck... No... No fucking way. I used the dead junk account.<br /><br />Way to go, dumbass. ::headdesk::<br /><br />So I had go to log into the dead account. I go to Excite, laugh at how the layout hasn't changed since 2000, then... fuck. It won't let me log in. Something about &quot;your browser is blocking Java &amp;/or Cookies.&quot; Great. Excite tended to clash with FireFox, so I switch browsers and open the dreaded Internet Explorer.<br /><br />It didn't work with IE, either.<br /><br />It gives me a message, telling me to update my browser. I think I was using IE 4 or 5, since I only keep the browser for those outdated sites that still think their page should only be viewed in IE's ad-laden glory. I go to update, but IE can't even access it's own update page! Pop-up blockers off, Java and cookies allowed, and it <i>can't even update itself</i>. I laugh, take a few screenshots for <a href=""javascript:void(0);/*1219201360763*/"">FAILblog</a>, then switch to FireFox.<br /><br />Huhn. I had to use FireFox in order to update Internet Explorer. I didn't think IE could fail any harder.<br /><br />So the installer for IE 7 is going. And going. It was so slow, I stepped away from the computer to do other stuff. I came back half an hour later and it was <i>still loading</i>. Holy shit. When it finally finished, I restarted my computer and went onto Excite to log in.<br /><br />It <i>still </i>wouldn't work. So I risk all and turn off my firewall, my anti-spyware, allow all Java and cookies, and basically get ready to be attacked by spyware and viruses and crap. Risk aside, I go check my e-mail.<br /><br />Suddenly, I'm faced with the worst e-mail interface this side of AOL. <a href=""http://www.yugiohtheabridgedseries.com/"">Holy shit on a shit sandwich</a>. Besides taking forever to load, it was just plain GOD-AWFUL. There was no option to delete more than one message at a time (aside from emptying a folder), e-mails automatically opened (including eye-raping porn-spam), and when I <i>did </i>want to open an e-mail, it opened up in a teeny tiny frame at the bottom of my screen. It wouldn't have been so bad if the frame didn't show only <i><b>three </b>lines of text at a time</i>.<br /><br />The people who designed it should never, <i>ever </i>breed. We can't allow this type of utter stupidity and failure to permeate into the gene pool.<br /><br />Also, it's been two hours and I still haven't received my forum activation e-mail. I know forum's not broken because I made a second account (with the right e-mail) to get help, and the e-mail showed up automatically.<br /><br />So, in closing:<br /><br />Internet Explorer still sucks (but I'm sure you already knew that)<br />Excite e-mail got worse (if that's even possible)<br />xkcd is still awesome, even if they just inadvertantly put me through hell and back."

Why do so many Johnny/Jenny No-names with a keyboard and access to the internet end up being complete and utter twats? Really now? I'll be trying to chat and some Douchebag McFuckerson will shove in and destroy the conversation, burning and salting the ground as they go. Sometimes it's possible to block said asshole, but other times it's not possible. Why? When said jerk is... oh let's say... a <i><b>moderator</b></i>? As in, someone that's supposed to make sure this stuff <i>doesn't</i> happen and the accused gets appropraitely <i>punished</i>? What's worse is when then entire thread is being taken over by <i>droves</i> of these people. You can't block every single person.<br /> <br /> What disappoints me more than seeing stupid people doing those things is smart people doing it. They could be using their wit and intelligence to hold a good conversation, to steer it back on track, or to avoid troll-feeding. But <i>no</i>, they waste it on being the same kind of twats. Worse, because their intelligence makes it harder to counter, ignore, or avoid.<br /> <br /> I was looking for people I could connect with. People I had similarities with. I know an internet forum isn't the best of places to do that, but it's still like having a conversation at the bus stop or out to lunch with coworkers/classmates/peers. The thing is, thanks to the anonymity of the internet, people can get away with being a completemenace to society and simply log off and be gone. <u><i><b><br /> <br /> </b></i><i><b>I hate those people, so very much.</b></i></u><br /> <br /> Being a jerk is one thing. Destroying someone's website, harassing people to traumatizing levels, and even contributing to breakdowns and IRL failures happen. That's utterly disgusting. Not only that, those attackers are weak for hiding who they are. They're too afraid of retributions to say things to someone's face. Without a face, a life, a story to attach to a screenname, they take out their aggression on often innocent suspects. Honestly, those kinds of people need to get help. Relishing in the suffering of someone that never did anything to you (not even met you) is sick, twisted, and below any human standards.<br /> <br /> I'm just saying that people need to take into account what they say and do and take responsibility for their actions. Yes, even if it's on the internet. Even without a name or face to attach to it, there's gotta be some karmatic response, even if someone is just being a douchebag."

"event","So I finally got around to playing <i>Guitar Hero</i> today. It's fun, but still over-rated. Within five minutes of starting, I ramped up to Medium and held strong. My friends didn't believe it was my first time playing, but I thank my experience with general rhythm games for helping my note/arrow/circle reading skills. I didn't really know any of the songs on the game, so that probably accounted to my indifference to the game. There were like three songs I was familiar with and a handful that I had heard before. But what can I say, I don't really like oldschool American rock.<br /><br />In terms of a party/get-together game, it's pretty decent. Anyone can pick it up and play, but it doesn't have the same attraction and universal controls as something like <i>Wii Sports</i> or <i>Mario Party</i>. Not trying to wave the Nintendo fanboy flag, but it's really not as inviting. Maybe three of us were playing, while everyone else sat around and watched.<br /><br />In terms of a game to play with a few interested friends, it's good. Take turns trying to one-up each other, beat your own high score, and unlock stuff seems fun. While it doesn't have the same workout as <i>Dance Dance Revolution</i> or even <i>Taiko Master</i>, it's fun pretending to be a rockstar. I just can't get into it very much, though. Methinks it has to do with the Playskool-esque plastic mini-guitar, the clicking of the strumming, and the wild flailing in attempts to activate Star Power.<br /><br />In terms of a game to play by yourself... Man. Kinda sad. You become That Guy, whom nobody wants to play with because he's too freakin' good. And not in the good way. In the way that's like, ""Dude, just go learn to play a real guitar."" And real guitars don't have little stickers on them, either.<br /><br />But yeah. It's a fun game. I'm not trying to say it sucks. It's just not my kinda thing.<br /><br />For kicks, I'll end by sharing a pretty great moment I had while playing. I was adjusting the strap on the guitar while a song was loading, and managed to whack myself in pretty hard the mouth with the guitar. I ended up splitting my lip and bleeding, which I laughed about, then promptly ignored to continue playing.

"event","i had an epiphany today, during a movie of all things. it was <i>American History X</i>, which is as harsh and depressing a movie can get without being a war film. neo-Nazis, seeing the light, trying to fix past sins, and a not entirely surprising, and yet still crushing ending (new beginning?).<br /><br />but yeah. there was a scene in the movie where the neo-Nazi son is fighting with his ""liberal hippie"" mom and her Jewish(?) boyfriend. the family was being torn apart by the hatred and lives were being ruined. as i watched it, i thought, ""how could that neo-Nazi be so blind and full of hatred that he can't even see what he's doing to his life and his family?""<br /><br />and then it hit me. while i'm definitely not a neo-Nazi, i was in no position to talk about that character's blind hatred. at least he turned around and began fixing things.<br /><br />i've been really unmotivated and lethargic for a while. about a semester and a half. no matter how much or how little sleep i got, i would always be tired and have no energy to do anything. all this while, i wondered where it all went. my sleeping patterns fluctuated and yet my energy levels still stayed low. even when i felt physically better, my spirit just wasn't up to it and i ended up not doing much anyway.<br /><br />so as i watched that scene, i realized i was letting hatred eat at me. all my energy, all my efforts, all my motivation. it was being driven by anger and hatred, and towards wrong &amp;/or unattainable goals. i would put <i>so much </i>into trying to right those wrongs that i had no energy left to <i>live my own life</i>. and so my life began to spiral downwards.<br /><br />month after month, and i soon lost sight of my original point. i don't even know what it was originally. something along the lines of ""punish those who mess things up for others and don't stop until they all learn their lesson and stop"". of course, that's an impossible task. there will <i>always </i>be new people messing up things, <i>always </i>new unjust happenings going unfixed, <i>always </i>new assholes to piss you off just. because. they. want. to. i let my anger take over and i let that run my life.<br /><br />i haven't really been myself for a while. i used to be the peacemaker. i would try to stop conflicts, not start them. but somewhere, the anger finally took hold and began rotting me from the inside. i would stop socializing with people due to certain traits, traits that they didn't really have control over. i saw myself as superior because i had something they didn't have. in a way, i became a supremacist and refused to associate with certain people.<br />i mean, i didn't want them eradicated. i wasn't going to be violent and forcibly remove them from my surroundings. i didn't even tell them that they pissed me off or sickened me, just for being who they were. and yet hating them and wanting them to leave still makes me guilty.<br /><br />i can't do this anymore. i can't keep hating others because it's manifesting as self-hatred. or maybe it was self-hatred all along and it was being projected onto others with the less-favorable traits i occasionally see in myself. whatever the case, i have to stop and remember that hate never did anything positive for anyone.<br /><br />while i'm not going to be all, ""i love the people i once hated"", i'll push myself back to being able to tolerate them, like i used to. despite the widened gap i felt between myself and certain people, i can't hate others for who they are. it's just not right. then once i get on that, i can start to pull my life back together."

"event","this is a rant. i'm not going to try to be insightful, not gonna say anything witty, not going end with some ""today's moral is..."" bullshit. i'm just letting out my rage without trying to be PC or censoring any of it.<br /><br /><b><i>i. fucking. hate. racism.<br /><br /></i></b>it came from the most ironic place today. we're watching a movie in my Diverse Identities class. note the DIVERSE in the title. these two motherfuckers come into the room some 30 minutes late, <i>riding their goddamned bikes into the room</i>. obviously making a huge fuss about it. like, ""oooo, look at me, everyone. i'm a goddamned important prick and you should all stop watching the shitty movie to look at me.""<br /><br />the movie itself was <i>Joy Luck Club</i>. don't know if you've seen it or not, but it's one of my favorite movies. it's a really sad tear-jerker, with some emotionally-crushing parts. it's the only movie that makes me cry every time i watch it.<br /><br />and these two fuckers decide to make jokes <i>and <u>laugh</u> </i>in a scene where a <u><i><b>baby is dying</b></i></u>. MAKING GODDAMNED JOKES AND BEING FUCKING CUNTS ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.<br /><br />at that point, i spoke up. i told them to stop laughing or to get the fuck out. they shut up, but only for another hour or so. then they began making comments like, ""why don't she talk normal? sounds <i>retarded</i>."" the character came from another place. it's called an accent, <i>you fucking douche</i>. i could say a thing or two about their horrible English and grammar. it's their first language, so they have no excuse except for being <i>braindead morons</i>.<br /><br />then came the jokes about Panda Express. those two cockbites ruined the movie, especially the dramatic heart-wrenching scenes. oh boy, <i>big </i>men now, aren't they? totally WITTY and SMART, HUH? OH SO FUNNY HAHAHA.<br /><br />they're in a goddamned DIVERSE IDENTITIES class. take your racism and <i><b>shove it up your fucking asses</b></i>.<br /><br />there isn't a day that goes by that i don't wish people like this would just disappear and stop fucking up society."

"event","ah, stupidity. my archnemesis. i mean, it turns decent people into douchebags, blabbering morons, and incompetent idiots who make more work for other people.<br /><br />hey, before i get into this, make note that stupidity =/= ignorance. ignorance is not knowing better. say, a kid touching a hot stove for the first time or someone basing his argument off inaccurate information. that doesn't irk me the way <i>stupidity</i> does. that's when people should know better, but do otherwise. usually it's because people are lazy and just not trying.<br /><br />this is mainly in my Environmental Science class. a good chunk of the class it taking it for the science requirement to graduate. i'm doing it for the requirement as well, but i'm actually interested in the stuff and do the work. however, a good chunk of the class just isn't trying.<br /><br />okay, okay. some people just can't grasp certain things. philosophy is a tricky subject. so are morals, the ""right"" religion(s), calculus, law, and other stuff like that. some people get them, some people just <i>can't</i>. it's not their fault.<br />but when the professor <i>goes through an example for 20 minutes</i>, <i>writes the answer</i> in <b>foot-high letters</b>, and <u><b>gestures</b></u> to it, <i><u><b>you'd better get that motherfucker right.<br /><br /></b></u></i>unfortunately, a student still tentatively answered in the form of a cautious question. i was almost banging my head on the desk at that point. i mean, about 80% of my class time is spent drawing. hey, i'm listening. i did the chapter readings, meaning it it's basically all review in class. the lecture was designed for the people that didn't do the reading. sure, it's a waste of time for those who did the work on time... but reviewing is good. not to mention i have 90 minutes to work on my graphic novel.<br /><br />but come on. people have said some dumb shit in class. sometimes i write them down just 'cause they're so absurd.<br /><br />(the professor finishes describing and re-describing a process about 3 times) <br />Prof: ""so, what is created when glucose is burned?"" (randomly calls a student to answer, really to check if they had been paying attention)<br />Student: (acts as if glucose is a foreign word) ""when... <i>glucose</i>... is burned?""<br />Prof: ""yes, burning glucose.""<br />Student: ""um...."" (flips through textbook)<br />Prof: (making it easy) ""so glucose becomes water, carbon dioxide, and...""<br />Student: ""....."" (looks flustered)<br /><i>(note: this chapter was about energy. the whole frikkin' lecture was about energy.)</i><br />Prof: (walks closer to the word ""ENERGY"" written on the board in foot-high letters)<br />Student: ""....i... i'm not sure. energy?""<br />me: ::headdesk::<br /><br /><br />Prof: ""why are they called fossil fuels?"" (randomly calls a student to answer)<br />Student: ""uh... 'cause.... it... comes from the ground?""<br />me: (unsuccessfully stifles laughter) *SNORT*<br />Student: (head drops onto arms in shame)<br />me: (continues ""stifling"" laughter the best i can)<br /><br /><br />so sometimes i get enraged. sometimes i laugh at them. i don't know what's the worst: the fact that people didn't do the reading, the fact that nobody was paying attention to the broken-record lecture, or the fact that they might just be too dumb to understand/retain this stuff.<br /><br />but seriously. if people just gave a shit, i'm sure people would do a lot better..."

"event","okay, so this weekend has been weird in terms of food schedule. thanks to Homecoming,  the staff decided it would be a good idea to change <i>everything </i>and serve meals in totally different places. i get out of bed, get juiced for brunch, then realize it's not even being served! :&lt;<br /><br />so. this weekend i've basically eaten ramen for all meals but dinner. and you know what? ramen is <b>awesome</b>. many a college student woulda starved without it. here are my two favorites.<br /><br /><b>Nissen Chow Mein</b><br /><a href=""http://www.nissinfoods.com/chowmein/""><img width=""250"" alt="""" src=""http://www.geocities.com/tterry138/nissin_chowmein_teriyakibeef.JPG"" /></a><br />it's instant, it's microwaveable, and most importantly, it's <i>tasty</i>! you can pick one up for a buck (at least i was able to) and it comes in such generic East Asian flavors such as Kung Pao Chicken, Thai Peanut, and Orange Chicken. my personal favorite is Teriyaki Beef. tastes more like Hoisin sauce than teriyaki, but hey, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">it tastes good</span>. can't say the same about health, though. each one packs 20% or your daily saturated fat. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">YUM.</span><br />(be cautious when microwaving these babies. the smell is super-strong and carries very far. i always seem to attract hungry students whenever i make these in the community kitchen!)<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sapporo Ichiban</span><br /><a href=""http://www.sanyofoods.co.jp/""><img alt="""" src=""http://www.koamart.com/images/products/1753_default.jpg"" /></a><br /><br />if you're gonna eat ramen, eat the #1 ramen. it costs more than your classic ""10 for $1"" ramen, but it's <span style=""font-style: italic;"">worth it</span>. i used to get these when i didn't have access to a decent microwave. now that i do, i still pick up these when i get the chance. throw in some canned veggies, an egg&nbsp; (or beans, for you vegans) for protein, and you're good to go!<br /><br />so while these aren't the healthiest options, they sure help when you're low on cash and the cafeteria is closed!"

"event","no, i'm not an asshole. no real spoilers. i want to stab those people in the eye; why would i give away plot details myself?<br /><br />so here's the thing. i've been avoiding the internet lately. much of the 6th book was spoiled for me after coming across a few forum posts and e-mails from ""friends"". so i'm going to avoid as much as i can until i get start the book myself.<br /><br />but hey. i can have <i>theories</i>, right?<br /><br />so if you haven't read it yet and don't even wanna hear theories (aka ""possible spoilers""), then don't read this article.<br /><br />if you <i><b>have</b> </i>read/finished the book, go ahead and read. nothing will be spoiled for you. <i><u><b>BUT DON'T CONFIRM OR DENY ANYTHING.</b></u></i> i haven't read it and <i><u><b>DON'T WANT IT SPOILED</b></u></i>. these are my ideas to be written down to see how accurate i can get before reading the final book.<br /><br />so this is your last chance.<br /><br />still want to read on?<br /><br />your choice.<br /><br />********************************************************<br />here's my theory. it's not entirely my own, but more of bits from other peoples' theories, plus my own additions.<br /><br />so Voldy made those horcrux... soul holder thingamabobs (i'm not going to look it up for fear of spoilers). and he has 7 parts, right? his diary, the ring, something from Slytherin, his snake Nagini... um... i don't remember them all. but basically two parts were left unidentified.<br /><br />now here's the thing: one part is in Voldy himself. my theory on the last one?<br /><br />Harry.<br /><br /><b><i>Harry </i></b><b><i>Potter</i></b> is the last horcrux. i mean, the scar is all unique and stuff. maybe nobody has even stored part of their soul in another <i>person</i>, so that's why the lightning bolt has never been seen before. maybe it's not a lightning bolt, maybe it's a <i>rip</i>, representing the <i>tearing apart</i> of Voldy's soul. i mean, it kinda explains his sensing of Voldy's feelings and seeing through Nagini and stuff. i mean, how else to explain the connection with someone hundreds of miles away?<br /><br />and then there's the problem: to kill Voldy, they need to destroy all of his horcrux...es. and so what do they do with Harry?<br /><br />so either Harry makes a self-sacrifice to get Voldy dead... or there's a lame-ass deus ex machina that saves Harry and kills Voldy. like James' and Lilly's love (and &lt;3&lt;3 <b>The Power of <i>FRIENDSHIP!</i> </b>&lt;3&lt;3) forcing the soul out because evil Voldy couldn't handle love or something.<br /><br />i'unno. that's my theory. if that's what really happens... well. wow. i'm good. or JK Rowling left too many clues. if it's <u><b><i>better</i></b></u> than the canon ending... i could write my own fucking books and earn more than the Queen of England."

"event","...yes, <i>everywhere</i>... unfortunately.<br /><br />let's get some things straight:<br /><b>ignorant</b><br />an <i>ignorant</i> person lacks the knowledge, doesn't know any better, and it's <i>not their fault. </i>learning what's right can fix this. no biggie.<br /><b>stupid</b><br />a <i>stupid </i>person had the proper knowledge, experience, judgement, etc. and yet <i>still </i>did it wrong. honest mistakes are not stupidity, but doing something wrong purposely (and knowing fully of the consequences) is stupidity.<br />now that we've explained that, let's get back on track.<br /><br />so this... ""stupidity"" as you call it... correct me if i'm wrong, but it seems to be... EVERYWHERE. okay, maybe not in a MENSA meeting... but i bet at least one of those intellectual individuals still occasionally does stupid things. but that's not the same as <i>being </i>stupid. that's less of an action and more of a constant <i>state of being</i>. so why does it seem to be so rampant?<br /><br />well, let's break some things down. maybe i'm wrong on this whole concept of ""stupid"" and ""smart"". to figure out where those lie, we have to figure out where ""average"" lies.<br /><br />mathematically, the word ""average"" means the adding up all of the results and dividing by the number of results.... but in daily speech, the word seems to have taken on a different meaning. instead of that middleground, ""average"" seems to have canged to describe the ""mode"". i case you forgot your fourth grade education, ""mode"" is the result that pops up the most. for example, let's go with... i'unno... shoe sizes. ten people surveyed, with the results: 7, 7, 8, 5, 9, 6, 7, 10, 13, 6.<br /><br />6+6+6+6+7+7+8+9+10+11 = 76<br />76/10 = <b>7.6</b><br />the <i>average </i>would be about size 7 1/2. however, the <i>mode </i>is 6. seeing as 7.5 =/= 6... well here we can see how the mathematical average and the everyday speech ""average"" (aka ""mode"") aren't the same.<br /><br />okay, maybe some of you are thinking, ""WTF. you brought in math. <i><b>MATH</b></i>. wtf, now i'm too lazy to go back and check your work. also, numbers are intimidating so i'm just gonna agree 'cause it's easier.""<br />um.... those who thought that are the <i>exact </i>people i'm bitching about. GTFO, n00bs.<br /><br />so to judge the average intelligence, i'll have to use stuff like highest education attained, test scores, IQ scores... unfortunately, those things are really stupid. i mean it. let's use the example of... a fisherman. he knows the best places to drive his boat, the best weather and time to catch the right fish, the best equipment and bait, and catch the best fish. he knows the names of them, can differentiate the males from females, the young from the old, and the delicious ones from the ones that taste like ass. you can give him some twine and he'll make a net in a day. however, he has a 9th grade education. is he smart? stupid? what about his successful fishing business? who's to say he's ""stupid""?<br /><br />...wait. i'm not helping my argument. so let's go with ""book smarts"" and leave out ""life smarts"" for now.<br /><br />the screenshot below is taken from the US Census of 2000.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v309/silverdragon706/census.jpg"" /><br />(in case you're worried that i modified the data in any way, you can find the PDF file here: <a href=""http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf"">http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf</a>)<br /><br />so a good chunk of people who took that census survey have never gotten beyond high school. um... basing the average people i deal with on that fact... hmm. makes a lot more sense now.<br /><br />well... it <i>has </i>been 7 years since that survey was taken, though. and who's to say about the people who didn't take it? the margin for error?<br />okay, now i'm just floundering. MOVING ON.<br /><br />according to the big smart people who made the IQ test, <b>100 </b>is the average IQ score. now i've never taken an official IQ test, but a bunch of silly free ""accurate"" ones i took gave me a score anywhere from 130-140. factoring in the fact that it's meant to give you a higher score so they sucker you into buying your ""complete and accurate"" results... i'd say my score is around 120.<br /><br />i... um... <i>hmm</i>.<br /><br />i've kinda been basing my expectations for others on... my own standards, i guess. and seeing as i've already surpassed the average person's education levels... maybe it's not that everyone around me is stupid. maybe they're just <i>ignorant</i>.<br /><br />i'm not sure where to end this now. i guess <i>i'm</i> the ignorant one when it comes to knowledge of the average person.<br /><br />oops. i'd better think some more next time i write one of these."

"event","they're <i>fucking awesome</i>, you know that?<br /><br />i'm serious. a few years ago, i would have bitched about violence levels in games. and then i realized how much more violence is in the news and the current events we hear about. there's a WAR going on and people are like, ""hurf durf. video games are HORRIBLE. war? no, we need to focus on what's important: taking video games away so that kids can learn to be violent from watching the news! hurf durf.""<br /><br />...get your priorities straight. i'm referring to all of those bitchy people who condemn before doing research, but <i>especially </i>referring to Jack Thompson. <u><font color=""#ff0000""><b><i>especially</i></b></font></u>. fucker needs to get his facts straight. last time i checked, he thinks that games teach people to kill. um... sure. pressing buttons and moving a joystick in a digital (read: <i><b>FAKE</b></i>) world teaches you how to sharpshoot and kill your entire school.<br /><br />of my gamer friends, i'd have to say all of them play violent games, most of them rated M. i'm the only gamer who doesn't play one on a regular basis. so who's violent? the ones who love zombie shooters and hack-and-slash games are the ones least likely to fight, strike people, or become aggressive. i'd have to say <b><i>I</i></b> am the most violent and sadistic fucker in my entire group of gamer friends. seriously, the only rated M game i've ever played was Halo (and it was three times). in terms of rated M games, it's <i>very </i>tame. no correlation there.<br /><br />i wish i could find that report i read a while back. it was about an study that found that <i>watching </i>recorded violent acts (i.e. movies, shows, <i>the news</i>) caused the people to commit more violent actions than <i>acting them out digitally</i> (i.e. <b>video games</b>). i sure as hell wanted to fight a lot more after seeing <i>Fight Club </i>than wanted to shoot someone after playing <i>Halo</i>. the thing is, video games allow people act out fantasy situations and get them out in a <i>safe </i>way. instead of doing it in reality, they do it on a game console or a computer. hell, i'd rather have a digital shooter run around a fake world than a frustrated teen take it out in his school.<br /><br />personally, i use violent games to vent. instead of punching that annoying prick in the face, i go and shoot a digital zombie in the face. my personal fave is this simple-yet-awesome game, where you set up a barricade and try to survive wave after wave of zombies.<br /><a href=""http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/375622"">The Last Stand</a><br />obviously NSFW. i recommend the chainsaw paired up with either the <font size=""2"" face=""Arial,Helvetica"">M4A1 or the </font>high-powered rifle (i forget the name). when you're completely enraged, nothing's more satisfying than shoving a chainsaw into a zombie's chest.<br /><br />but hey! it's not like i'd ever do anything similar in real life. i can't bear to genuinely hurt anyone. if you were hoping to learn how to use a real AK-47 by playing that Flash game, you're out of luck. it's just a way to vent digitally instead of resorting to <i>real </i>violence.<br /><br />&gt;shock&lt;<br />violent video games are a way to vent and be violent digitally instead of for real? and violent people will be violent, regardless of video games??

"event","no no no. i am <i>not </i>bitching about gardens. who the fuck does that? that's like being angry at puppies! although today they indirectly made me angry. i was driving past the mall and saw a sign advertising a pet store. as if those cruel ""stores"" weren't bad enough... the sign read: <br /><br /><div align=""center"">""PUPPYS<br />KITTTENS<br />Take one home today!""<br /></div><br />what the fuck. ""puppys""?? if i wasn't driving, i would have knocked over the sign. or set it on fire.<br />um... tangent. back on track!<br /><br />yeah, i'm not bitching. can't i rave about something awesome?<br /><br />so i'm definitely guilty of going to the garden sections of stores and just walking around. today we went to Target for some garden soil and i spent more time poking all of the flowers and being entranced by garden fountains. just the whole feel of it: the smell of the plants and flowers, the green light filtering through the mesh ceiling and reflecting off leaves, the sound of water gurgling in nearby display ponds. it's just so <i>amazing</i>.<br /><br />back at home, we put the garden soil in a rectangular plot we'd cleared. after weeks of sore arms from using a pick-axe to dig up grass, a sore back from picking out rocks and rusty nails, it was satisfying to finally pour the soil into place and smooth everything out. i don't know what my mom's going to plant in the new plot, but we already have watermelon, green beans, bell peppers, and <i>gai choy</i>, a Chinese leafy green.<br /><br />the front lawn needed watering, so i headed out front to take care of that. despite owning a sprinkler, today i watered everything by hand. it was nice to admire the citrus trees and abundant roses. when i water the rose bushes, i pretend i'm giving them life. it's silly, but i really did help them grow. preparing the area, adding growing soil, digging holes and planting the roses, fertilizing and mulching, watering and pruning... it's no wonder our roses are so gorgeous.<br /><br />after i finished, i went back to the back yard and flopped down to admire the yard. i thought about it: all of the plant life in and around our house is mostly cared for by my mother, but without my dad, my siblings, and myself, it wouldn't have gotten there. it's nice to see a family project grow and flourish.<br />ah, a gorgeous bit of nature surrounding me. it's like Mother Nature is hugging my home.<br />...yes i'm aware of how lame that sounds. well, fuck off. it's awesome.<br /><br />even better, tomorrow my family is going to the Lotus Garden in Modesto. you haven't seen gorgeous flower gardens until you've seen a pond full of lotus flowers, all in bloom. willow tree branches draping the area, slowly swaying in the warm breeze... tiny frogs peeping from their hiding places until the giant lotus leaves...<br /><br />so even if you don't have any of that nearby, go out and make your own garden. hell, a potted plant will do. adding a bit of nature back into today's artificial world will only help you. and gorgeous plants and flowers help brighten up the room!<br /><br />come on. think about it!"

"event","okay, not ""kids"" per se. more like ""rules dealing with kids"".<br /><br />i say ""kids"" but many consider me a kid myself. 19-going-on-20 is barely old enough to bitch about things these days. i catch myself saying ""when i was that age"" or ""back in the day"" more and more. and yes, it <i>is </i>to reminisce. my 13-year-old brother knows how lucky he is to get a cell phone at age 10, to grow up around computers, and to have the internet be so widely established and used.<br /><br />but that aside, i want to touch on&nbsp; a few things. all of this nice stuff? kids are getting weak. the things people do to protect and spoil kids nowadays? what the fuck?<br /><br />really, when i was 6, the school playground consisted of monkey bars, a metal slide, and a GIANT tire swing that was made up of about 30 tires connected into a giant ring of treaded AWESOME... but everything was pretty dangerous. i mean, the only thing under the equipment was tanbark- a bunch of wood chunks about the size of a D battery. falling onto those cushioned your fall, but the splinters that came with it was horrible. and what happened after i healed? <i>i learned a lesson</i>: don't jump off the slide. even if it's a 100-fucking-degrees because the sun heated the metal surface.<br />at my tutoring job, i work with kids from age 5-11. the playground that they have? everything is PLASTIC. even the metal support bars are plastic- or foam-covered. ladders are non-existant. everything is <i>stairs</i>. stairs and hand rails. aparently the ladders of my day were too dangerous for kids. how fun are STAIRS? i mean, ladders are like, ""climb me and we'll have and adventure!"" stairs are like, ""well. there's another level up here. and a slide that's plastic and shocks you on hot days.""<br />and the surface below the playstuff? some sort of squishy rubber stuff. i walked across it and <i>bounced </i>with every step. i jumped a few times and it absorbed every bit of shock. holy shit, man.<br />now what do kids learn when they fall off of that? <i>-BOINGboingoingoingoing-</i> ""hey, falling doesn't hurt. it's <i>fun! </i>let's do it again!""<br />....maybe i'm pushing it. but kids still don't learn about falling hard from high places.<br /><br />you're probably thinking, ""but you're not talking about <i>rules</i>!""<br />oh, i'm getting there. just you wait.<br /><br />kid's shows have gone down the toilet. well... most television shows in general have gone downhill, but kid's shows are actually <i>important</i>. they teach kids stuff that their parents were too lazy/stupid to do. my favorite kid's shows? <i>Power Rangers</i> and <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>. they were fucking AWESOME. i remember how cool it was to watch it and like it. now if i'm not mistaken, most episodes came with morals and lessons. the end of <i>PR </i>often had a short blip about non-violence or staying off drugs or other ""after-school"" stuff. i don't remember it being in <i>TMNT</i>, thanks to my incredibly young age while watching that. but i guess it had similar stuff. after all, i never wanted to run after people waving ninjaken, nunchaku, sai, or a bo. in fact, i never really wanted a weapon until about a year ago, when i was smitten after walking through a swords-and-knives store in Japantown of San Francisco.<br /><br />but now? now?? fuck. censors here, 4Kids there... haha. 4Kids. you guys take shitty manga-gone-anime and manage to make it even shittier. but really, i can bet that most families watch the news together. maybe during meals, with the TV replacing conversation? and that has a helluva lot more violence than shows. what did it help to censor it from the kid's shows? and those lessons? <i>gone</i>. i haven't seen a kid's show with lessons or morals unless it was specifially an ""education show"". fuck, kids learn from ALL shows, from <i>Naruto </i>(or as i like to call it, <i>Naru</i>-back-to-the-fires-of-hell-you-demon!<i>-to</i> or <i>Narutarded</i> for short... making ninjas lame should be a <u><i><b>crime</b></i></u>, punishable by seppuku) to <i>Spongebob </i>""holy shit this is a <i>kid's </i>show?? that was an adult joke!"" <i>Squarepants</i>.<br /><br />anyway, that's all for making money. it's corrupted now anyway.<br /><br />so. rules. fucking rules. a little story:<br /><br />i was tutoring one of my regular kids a few months ago. he's the sweetest boy, but has major anxiety problems. thus i often talk to him about his problems to help him out. one day, he's telling me about things his school has banned. i was thinking, ""<i>can't be <b>that </b>bad, can it?</i>""<br /><br />oh. it was <i>bad</i>.<br /><br />yo-yos, playing cards &amp; trading cards, <i>t-shirts with <b>any </b>words</i>, playing tag, <i>running during recess</i>, older kids (3rd-5th grade) mingling with younger kids (1st-2nd), younger kids playing on the paly equipment...<br /><br />what. the. fuck. that's pretty bad. i mean, <i>no running during recess</i>?? what the fuck are the kids supposed to do? sit and talk quietly? wait, no. talking can lead to arguments. or even worse, OPINIONS. the only way to prevent it is to BAN TALKING!!<br /><br />well. at least they're not as bad as <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/17/AR2007061701179.html?hpid=topnews"">this school</a>. fucking morons, those school board members.<br />....heh. bloody knuckles. i play that with my brother. i'm like the older brother he never had. we roughhouse but he knows not to use violence to deal with things.<br /><br />so my point? i... don't really have a point to this entry. i just want to say that these stupid unneeded rules aren't helping kids. by toning down the bad and then not explaining why it's bad and not giving a <i>good </i>example, we end up teaching kids some pretty fucked up things. or not teaching them good things.<br /><br />come on. think about it."

English is a very fluid language. old words are constantly gaining new meanings and new words are constantly being created. i'm fine with vernacular, words only used in certain groups and situations, etc. what bugs me is when this stuff slips into formal writing. i'm going to be an English tutor next year. if someone turned in a paper, i'd expect to contain decent English. if i got a paper with words like ""ain't"", ""cuz"", or ""prolly"" (i fucking HATE that last one)... unless it was a story with someone's spoken dialogue, i wouldn't even bother to proofread it. <i>i'd give it back and make them rewrite it.<br /><br /></i>i'm not being a bitch. it's going to be for college-level students. not everyone is a good writer. i know that. i expect it to be at least high school senior level, though. after all, they needed to learn that before graduating and making it into college.<br /><br />call me a Grammar Nazi (which i am), but the next thing that really bothers me is:<br /><br /><b><u>Internet English</u></b><br /><br />why is it that every time i go on the internet, somebody's writing makes me want to beat them senseless with a dictionary? tell me, which example of writing sounds better and would be taken more seriously?<br /><br />A: hey, i was surfing around and found this short video. it's hilarious! here's the link to the site: [link inserted]<br />B: hay look @ vid!!! LOL its realy funny ROFL da n00bs was soooooooooooooooo st00pid LOL!!!! WHAT A IDIOT WACH IT!!!! [link inserted]<br /><br />seriously. if you said B, i'll have to beat you with a dictionary. if you know English then USE THE FUCKING LANGUAGE. here's a few real IM messages i've had with people, screen names removed.<br /><br />Conversation A:<br />me: hiya<br />me: long time, no see<br />me: or the grammatically correct version:<br />me: ""I haven't seen you in a long time.""<br /><u>Friend A: haha i know<br /></u>me: so how's life?<br />me: i assume you've been busy?<br /><u>Friend A: oh man<br />Friend A: yeah lol<br /></u>me: busy as a bee?<br />me: well.. a female bee, anyway<br />me: the drones (males) kinda sit around in the hive and mate with the queen<br /><u>Friend A: awesome.<br /><br /></u>you get the point. thanks to the way IMs work, there are many mising periods. also, this friend tends to leave out commas for some reason. you can still understand what's going on, though. here's another one:<br /><br />Conversation B:<br /><br />me: I HAS CHEEZITS<br /><u>Friend B: I HAS MUSHMELLOWS</u><br />me: I DUN LIK MUSHMELLOWS<br />me: I LIK CHEEZITS<br /><u>Friend B: YU DUN LYK MUSHMELLOS?! I DUN LYK YU<br /></u>me: BUT I LIK YU :&lt;<br /><u>Friend B: BUT YU NO LYK MUSHMELLOWS<br /></u>me: MUSHMELLOWS DUN LIK ME<b><br /></b><u>Friend B: YU CRAZEE. MUSHMELLOS LUV EVREEUN<br /></u>me: dude, why the hell are you typing like that? makes you look stupid.<br /><u>Friend B: because it seemed cool at the time...<br /><br /></u>no, i'm afraid it isn't cool to look ignorant. while Friend B and i do this mockingly all of the time, it shows just how stupid you look when you type like that.<br /><br />comments on site tend to be ever worse than the IMs i get. in my <a href=""http://fyrenwater.sheezyart.com"">art</a> <a href=""http://fyrenwater.deviantart.com"">galleries</a>, i've actually gotten comments like ""cutez art lol!"" or ""ur gay go bak to china"". those two are actually pasted from real comments. come on.<br /><br />my theory? if you type like a 10 year old, you WILL be treated like one. if you type like a moron, you WILL be treated like one. if you type like a ch@t-sp33king 1337 h@xx0r.... you will never get laid.<br /><br />if you type like an intelligent person and show that you know how to properly set up a sentence, you will be treated with respect... except from those morons. but who really cares what they think or say anyway?<br /><br />THEIR SOOOOOOOOOO St00piD!!!!! TO St00PID 2 RITE GOOD LYK ME ZOMGZ!!!! THEY PROLLY DIDNT EVEN GO 2 HI SCHOOL COME ON!! R THEY DUM OR WHAT!!!!!!"

"event","lol, innuendo. it's <i>funny </i>'cause the <i>bang </i>refers to something <i>sexual</i>. :D<br /> <br /> so i just had a conversation about- you guessed it- SEX. SEX SEX SEX. i just increased the traffic to my page by 300%. isn't it <i>great </i>that i'm probably getting all of the pervs who look for porn? just <i>lovely</i>, huh?<br /> <br /> anyway, the main part of the conversation centered about <u>sexual education</u>. that's our happy little controversial topic for this post. now if i'm not mistaken, most people who went to school in the States within the past... i'unno, 30 or so years had some sort of sex ed. for me, my formal class was in 6th grade. this was the wonderful age when ""penis"" made you giggle, ""vagina"" made you gasp, and boys still thought touching a girl ANYWHERE would make her pregnant. why that age was when sex ed was started, i had no fucking clue.<br /> fast-forward 3 years, to freshman year of high school. my mandatory health class also included a whole section on sex. we learned about contraceptive devices, STDs and other fun diseases, and the harsh reality of teenage &amp;/or unwanted pregnancies.<br /> <br /> here's the problem: <i>not everyone gets this</i>. some people (*cough* GOVERNMENT *cough* ) want to teach something else. that something else? abstinence ONLY. as in ""exclusively"". <b><i>OOOOOOONLY</i></b>.<br /> <br /> come on. we were all teens at one point. hormones made you want to fuck. we went through that rebellious phase where doing the opposite of what adults said was the best fucking thing ever. so if stuffy Mr./Mrs./Ms. ""Sex"" Ed told you that is was HORRIBLE to have sex, what would be your first reaction? my theory? something along the lines of: ""duuuuude. that means sex has got to be <b><i>the shit!!</i></b>""<br /> <br /> now i'm not saying that abstinence is a bad thing. i'm <i>not </i>saying that it's okay for teens to run off and get (others) pregnant. i think abstinence should be taught- as <i>one </i>option <i>out of <b>many</b> </i>for teens. ""abstinence only"" is a stupid thing to teach. saying that it's the only option is leaving teens without a full story. ignorance only leads to BAD DECISIONS. i say tell the teens the whole story and then let them decide. it's their body, who's to tell them what's right or not right for them to do?<br /> <br /> speaking of which, what about masturbation? if peopel are so freaked out about teens having sex, shouldn't masturbation be a great way to prevent pregnancies?<br /> wait, no. i'm sorry. it's too <i>vulgar</i>. too <i>obscene</i>. it's <i>disgusting</i>. oh my. you'll go grow hairy palms and go blind.<br /> <br /> (no bitching that i'm a slut. i'm a virgin, get it right. also, don't jump to conclusions and think i'm some weirdo who glorifies random orgies with strangers or something, please note that i <i>strongly oppose </i>having random orgies with strangers. it's safer to do so with a group of consensual friends that have all been recently checked and are STD-free.)<br />  <br /> you know what happens when people aren't allowed to have sex or masturbate? when there's no way to get sexual gratification? people become <i>sexually frustrated</i>. you know what that leads to? frustration causes issues, like stress and <i>violence</i>.<br /> <br /> wait. violence? you mean like hitting people and guns and explosions? ohhh... that's <i>totally fine!</i> i mean, look at television! look at movies! people do that all of the time! it's totally fine to fight 'cause they're <i>not having sex!</i> i mean, since when has punching and kicking and shooting and stabbing hurt people?<br /> <br /> nooooooooo, you've got it aaaaaalllllllllllllllll wrong. SEX is what hurts people! and you know what else? BOOBIES. boobies are a threat to safety and we should be on <i>fuschia alert </i>whenever boobies are seen. <i>puce alert </i>for mentions of sex!<br /> [/sarcasm]<br /> <br /> seriously, the States are giving sex a much worse a reputation than it deserves. provide more readily available knowledge and teens will be able to make their own INFORMED decisions. don't shove one person's morals (*cough* HARDCORE RELIGION *cough*) onto an entire state &amp;/or nation. everyone's body is their own and with enough information, each person should be able to make the best decision for himself, herself, or hirself."

"event","A few things to touch on so I don't have to deal with them later:<br /><b>1. <u>LANGUAGE</u><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. </b>I <i>will </i>swear. This was never supposed to be a child-friendly page, so don't expect it to be. If you're threatened, angered, or simply annoyed by the words, just remember that words only have power if you give them power. While it's not my intent to offend people, it cant and will happen. Language will probably be the least offensive thing that comes from me.<br /><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. </b>Slang will occasionally be used. Most things can be figured out just by reading it. If it's confusing, try reading it out loud. For instance, ""I'unno"" means ""I don't know"". I type the way I speak, so saying things out loud will help you understand.<br /><b><br />3. <u>SARCASM AND HUMOR</u><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. </b>If you don't like sarcasm, it is advised that you leave as soon as possible. Sarcasm is one of my best skills and only weapon against mediocrity and the easily-confused. <i>You have been warned.</i><br /><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. </b>The humor I use and appreciate can be confusing or offensive to many people. Sometimes it's dry, sometimes it's satirical, sometimes it's dark and morbid, and sometimes it's a sharp mocking kind of humor. My theory is that people should lighten up, learn to laugh more, and take things seriously only if they <i>have </i>to. Offensive material to some is downright hilarious to others. Still, I have my limits. Even <i>I</i> can be offended.<br /><b><u><br />4. OPINIONS</u><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.</b> They're mine. You have yours. <i>They can be different, <b>even opposing</b>, and we can still converse like mature people.</i> One sign (out of many) of an intelligent person is to be able to understand different &amp;/or opposing ideas/opinions and still be able to hold an idea/opinion of his/her own. We're all individuals with equally important opinions and ideas. Everyone's entitled to their own views and these entries are just my views.<br /><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Politics: I</b> make fun of Republicans. I make fun of Democrats. Hell, I make fun of the entire US government and the systems within it. That doesn't mean that I think they're wrong, though. If one side is wrong, then they all are. They're just <i>different</i>. I criticize the government, but that <i><u><b>DOES NOT</b></u></i> make me unpatriotic or (heaven forbid) a terrorist. Look up the word patriot: ""A person who <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/love"" title=""love"">loves</a>, <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/support"" title=""support"">supports</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/defend"" title=""defend"">defends</a> his or her <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/country"" title=""country"">country</a>."" Well, a part of&nbsp; ""love"" is to do what you think is best for that person/thing, even if it's not the best thing for you. ""Defend"" is part of my defense of some simple American rights: the Bill of Rights. It's completely <u><b><i>unpatriotic</i></b></u> to just accept the flaws as is and not even try to improve things.<br /><div align=""center""><font size=""-1"">""People who enjoy waving flags don't deserve to have one"" -Banksy</font><br /></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>c. Discrimination: </b>I try my best not to discriminate, but I'm not perfect. There are still types of people that bother me (you'll be able to figure out what kind after you run through some of my posts.) We've all got our flaws, though. However, haters are not welcome. If you can't respect (or at least tolerate) different people and their views, GTFO. If I'm sounding hater-ish, please let me know. Posts written in a fit of rage may come off a lot more harshly than I would have been than if I had been level-headed at the time.<br /><br />That's it for now. topics and notes will be added as needed."

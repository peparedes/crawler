"event","people in this world are not worth experiencing. everyone has the ability to love and hurt. to be helpful and cruel. to seek the truth or to lie. you cannot trust anyone. in the end, they all do what best suits them. or what they think best suits them. you're all you've got. love yourself. no one else ever truly will."

"event","nooo its surrounding me.
its such a pointless thing!
i mean its a release
but it makes us do such stupid things!
and stresses us out more!
its so much easier to be angry than to be hurt
its so easy to lean on anger
but it only hurts you
it only hides whats really there
anger is over powering
you cant let it control you"

"event","is mine to write whatever the hell i want to in it
i say what im initially thinking and feeling in here
if i go off on a rant its just that, a rant
everyone else thinks the same things i do
dont pretend like you dont
just because i write it down and dont deny thinking it doesnt make me a bad person
if you dont like it, dont read it
and if you read it anyway dont bitch to me about it.
and if i privlage you with being my friend on here or sending you the link, dont sent it to other people
or if you make it a point to find this journal, dont be a bitch and send it to other people either.
so its now private.
if you really want to read it, make a live journal and add me.
bye."

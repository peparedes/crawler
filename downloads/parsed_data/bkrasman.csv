"event","Well, this certainly has been an eventful weekend. But it all started Friday when I almost ... DIED. No really. Death, almost a reality. Here's the story:

At about 2 Friday afternoon, Jen and I were on our way to lovely Lancaster to see a show and interview one of the bands. As we're on our way down the PA Turnpike near Somerset County, we realize we're spinning out of control. Apparently we had hydroplaned. So in the midst of bigtime spinning, we slam head-first into the solid concrete Jersey barrier. That sent us flying backward, once again in a violent spin, when we slam back-first into the barrier. We were like a 2,000-pound pinball lodged in a two-lane concrete passageway. At times during the spinning, we were able to see the cars behind us (that's right, behind us) coming right at us.

So we're traumatized, naturally. My knee was throbbing and my neck hurt, and Jen had a big scrape across her throat from the seatbelt (she's a tad too short for seatbelt usage) and also jarred her neck. We're freaking out badly. We drove ever so carefully to the first rest stop to assess the damage. Magically, there was almost no damage. And we slammed the SHIT out of the Jersey barriers. He hit hard. The result was a scraped front bumper, and a slightly scraped back bumper. ROCK!

Now the scary part, which of course is realizing what COULD have happened had the situation been different. Had the other cars been near us, we certainly would have slammed into them and caused indeterminable amounts of damage and injury. But luckily, no one fell victim to our spinning vehicle of terror. Also, about a half mile or so down the road is a giant cliff, and all that stands between the road and said mountain is a puny guardrail. If we had hydroplaned there, well, you wouldn't be reading an update. Ever.

Of course, I guess the reason the water had pooled was because the Jersey barriers that surrounded the two lanes of roadway held the rain in place. There likely was no real drainage for the rain, so that's why hydroplaning was so possible there. Perhaps where the cliff and guardrail were, the water was able to drain over the side. But try to tell us that as we're freaking out following our car spiraling out of control.

We went to the show anyway since the damage was minimal. We actually had a lot of fun considering. Jen insists she's concussed, and she might well be since I listened to Lamb of God at full volume on the way home to stay awake, and she has no recollection of this. We finally arrived home at like 2:15 in the morning, some 12 hours after our peril.

Jen and I have spent most of the weekend calling everyone we know to retell the tale. We both find it funny now that A.) we're both fine and B.) the car is not badly damaged at all. Some people who heard the story agreed it was hilarious, while others with no sense of humor chided us. Ah screw it. It was funny. If you live through something like this, you should be able to feel however you want about said scenario. We lived, therefore we laugh riotously. hahahahahahahahahahaha"

"event","Something bizarre happened over my 29 years on earth. Somehow I lost the ability to remember anything. Just ask me some things I learned in college on a subject that isn't journalism related. Forget it. I'm a clean slate. What happened?

I did really well in college, and I enjoyed most of my classes. But I have nothing left to prove I was there. That's scary. A few weeks ago I read a story about an American spy who was lynched by the British troops during the Revolutionary War, but I'll be damned if I can remember his name. It'll come to me, but shouldn't that info be something that rolls right off my tongue?

I know who is running for presidential nomination for the Democratic party, but I'll be damned if I can remember what half of them state as their platform. Maybe that's a good thing.

I've taken no significant blows to the head, and I have not taken any mind-altering drugs. So I don't have a clue. Maybe it's being in the workforce now for half a decade. Perhaps it's just natural to lose that knowledge you don't use on a daily basis. That's why I have to start reading again. I'm usually so sapped after work that all I can think about is a long nap. I guess I'll have to sacrifice some of that time for some reading.

But it's Monday again, and as usual, I'm bored to tears. I have to get out of here, or else I'll go mad. I'm tired of hearing stories from people that have nothing to do with the issue at hand. It's not that I don't care that your family is doing well, it's just that I don't need to hear the latest episode of what we all did over the weekend, who drank what and how much, who did who and how often and why your family's activities have gone awry. It's just irritating to listen to on a Monday morning, maybe moreso for me considering the mental state I've been in as of late.

It also irritates me that there are like 400 people on vacation today when the rule here is you can't have multiple people off from a single department in one day. Oops. That's a rule? Oh wait, yes it is. Every time I tried to schedule vacation I can't do it because someone's off. And since I'm the second newest editor, I am very low on the seniority pole. So I'm fucked when it comes to vacation.

Half of the vacation issue is my fault. I don't like the summer at all, so I don't travel much during those months. So I can work. All I want is some extra time around the holidays, but hey, so does everyone else. So by the time the vacation calendar is picked apart, I'm left with like a week in March, something in early November, and like the first week of December. Woo! And I can't cash out my vacation weeks, so I have to take off or miss out. Well, I'm not going to waste vacation time. Maybe I should take it soon considering my state of frustration. I guess some mental relaxation time would do me good. Plus spending time anywhere but here, and being away from some of the most major sources of my headaches can only be positive.

I guess it's back to my desk. The only positive about my job I can muster today is because I start obscenely early, I can take off around lunchtime. So it's off home to my pets, lunch, and perhaps a book. Or sleep -- whatever desire consumes me first."

"event","Wow, I was in a great mood last night. Also, reading my post from some 12 hours ago made me realize that while I might get upset at people for really dumb things (mullets, T-shirts), that I guess as long as those people are happy, I shouldn't bitch. Clearly I'm not happy, and I'm doing none of those things. I don't know. 

So we're four hours away from the Steelers/Broncos game, and I don't mean to be negative, but I don't see this going well. But whatever. You never know.

I'm sure these posts sometimes seem manic or odd, but half the time I'm just doing these to clear the thoughts from my head. I can't just absorb that I'm thinking, I need to get rid of it somehow."

"event","So Pitt blows. It's bad enough they tanked it, but it was even worse that I had to sit in Heinz Field through the whole game. But I turned my wrath from the game and placed it on something even more heinous: the people of Pittsburgh. I watched some of the most ridiculous, questionable displays thoughout the night, and I am baffled at how I am drinking from the same water supplies and breathing the same oxygen.

Let's start with the fat guys who feel it's necessary to get up 57 times for yet another tray of nachos and a 700th beverage. Look if you're going to eat and drink to excess at a game, please be courteous. Like don't get up in the middle of a play. In case you never noticed, the plays only last a few seconds, so I'm sure your growling belly can wait. I didn't eat a single thing at the game, and look at me, I'm still alive. Oh, and there was this guy who returned from a concession stand march, and instead of asking me if I would move, he kind of snapped his fingers at me like I was a fucking cocker spaniel. Screw you, ass.

I also have to take issue with the hair styles of many people. Look, there's a reason people laugh at Pittsburgh as the town of the mullet. It's because it's woefully true. I saw a fellow in a Oilers hockey jersey with the most ridiculus mullet ever. He even had his hair pulled through the hole in the back of his hat. Either grow your hair long or cut the shit. Don't go in between, because you end up looking like an asshole.

Then there's the female version of the mullet, which is the same as the male version, except there's this little hair explosion on top of the head. It's like something blew up their bangs. It's often called ""Pittsburgh hair,"" and I don't understand how people think this looks good. Hey, 1987 was years and years ago. Can we please move on and get into 2003? I'd settle for 1995.

Here's another clue: A T-shirt is not to be worn like a dress. They are supposed to come just below the belt, at the longest. I saw a lady walking around tonight with a T-shirt that came to her knees. It's was like she was wearing a night shirt over jeans. Again, I just ask why? This poor soul was not the only violator, either. She's the only one I can remember off the top of my head.

Also, don't ever get an Ericcson cell phone. They fucking suck huge. But I'm tied to AT&T Wireless until August, so until then, it's awful cell phone reception shoved right up my ass. 

So I'm in a splendid mood. I don't see it changing over the next 24 hours, so sorry. Hope the rest of you are OK. Oh no. Justin Timberlake is hosting SNL ... yet ANOTHER thing that has gone wrong today."

So today's the big Pitt vs. Notre Dame game, which I will attend. If the Panthers lose, I have nothing left for which to be excited. Nothing. So damn it Pitt, win or else! The Steelers blow, I can't watch wrestling anymore, there's certain other elements of frustration with which I'm getting quite tired of dealing. Rargh!

But I'm interviewing Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed Tuesday and Randy Blythe from Lamb of God Wednesday. I swear, if anyone ever says to me again they can't land an interview for whatever lame reasom, I'l kill them. You CAN get it done. If I can get Jamey Jasta for an interview, so can you! Or maybe I'm just awesome.

OK, hopefully the weekend turns around. I doubt it. I think frustration and confusion will be hanging around with me rather faithfully into the near future..."

"event","As per my role as music critic at my newspaper of employment, I sometmes am forced to listen to some real shit. Don't get me wrong, the perk of free CDs (often a splendid way to discover a new band) is great, but when it comes to what I had to endure this morning, it's almost not worth the hell.

For today, I had to endure the new release from Ill Nino. See, I hate nu-metal in the same way some people hate the president or like some Christians hate the devil. I wish nu-metal nothing but death, torture and an eternity stuck in a narrow pipe filled with venomous spiders. So you can imagine my glee when I popped nu-metal bitches Ill Nino into the disc player. Two minutes later I wanted to vomit all over my desk.

I officially shall add Ill Nino to the list of records currently listed in my ""Stop Buying Shit"" campaign, which is sweeping Best Buy and other chain record outlets across the nation. I literally stopped two people from buying ""St. Anger"" which, as far as I'm concerned, means I should be allowed to sin, repurcussion free, for a month. Other selections on the ""Stop Buying Shit"" list:

* Any Linkin Park release
* Any Korn release after their second disc
* Anything from Limpbizkit
* Anything from Staind
* Any God-forsaken American Idol bullshit. If I see you buying Clay Aiken's record Tuesday, I'll fucking hit you. It's for your own good.
* Anything by Nickelback or Saliva, who as far as I'm concerned, are one in the same
* Any product of any sort released by Toby Keith. He needs a severe beating.

Of course, I'm helpful in this whole effort. After I spit at you and insult your family when you foolishly pick up the new Metallica, I'll happily replace the record with something from Arch Enemy, Children of Bodom, Iron Maiden or Lamb of God. And if you resist ... oh, so help me if you resists ... I'll headbutt you in the face. I'm not a big guy, but when it comes to you buying shit, I'll kill you. In a nice way."

But as music critic/editor/writer/babysitter where I work, I have a slew of CDs to listen to this afternooon. Luckily, most of them are metal. Sadly, none of them are very good. The new Ill Nino and Spineshank are on rotation this afternoon. Egad. It's Roadrunner stuff that needs revciewed because a.) the kids in our coverage area like it and b.) when something really good comes out, they'll send it my way. Spineshank has that disease where they swear simply for the sake of cursing. Blah.

I also have the new Mushroomhead to get through for next week. I don't get why people like them. I guess there's this big argument they're having with Slipknot about how came around first. Mushroomhead insists they came along first. That's like saying, I sucked before you did.

But I did get a nice new disc called Watch Them Die from Century Media. WTD are as pissed as you'd expect, and they blend elements of Bay Area thrash along with hardcore.

Today, an Adelphia service person will visit my home to remedy my problem, that being a dead cable Internet line. This will be the FOURTH house call since I had my service installed last Monday. Yes, in seven days, there's been four people from Adelphia at my home to try to fix this sham of a service. 

Last night as I watched the Steelers suck hard, I told an Adelphia customer service agent that I am one step away from nixing both the Internet AND my cable. She said if I did not have a service person come out, the problem could not be solved. I told her I flat out I do not believe anyone at Adelphia even knows HOW to solve my problem. They don't know what they're doing.

"event","This nation that is the United States never fails to amaze - or amuse - me. In one of those rare bipartisan moments, Congress yesterday overwhelming voted to support a national do-not-call list, which would allow Americans to have his or her name put on a list of numbers that telemarketers would be forbidden to call. Yay! But late yesterday, U.S. District Court Judge Ed Nottingham of Denver ruled against Congress' action.

Nottingham justified his action by claiming the do-not-call list, which allows non-profit groups and political parties to continue stumping for money, discriminates against for-profit entities and denies the First Amendment freedom of expression rights. Hold on while I laugh until blood streams from my eye sockets.

To say barring such a list denies for-proft agencies a freedom of expression right is beyond funny and stupid. So if all things are equal, authors should be able to come to my home to read passages of his or her new book. I should not be allowed to choose whether or not I can walk into my nearest Border's and select a work from the shelves. Hey, freedom of expression! And while we're at it, businesspeople should be allowed to interrupt my lunch or afternoon snooze by knocking on the back door and reading his or her company's mision statement in order to convince me to buy stock. Mmm Hmm. Freedom of expression, y'all.

Look, I am a fervent supporter of the First Amendment. I fight people all the time about it, even those who work in the same building as I do. There's very few things I think should be regulated (child porn is one ... children deserve a level of protection, First Amendment be damned), and I often express myself as openly, sometimes vulgarly, as I like.

The national do-not-call list could be reconsidered by Congress and passed again, in order for President Bush to sign. But the Supreme Court ultimately has the power to nix it for good.

Pennsylvania has a do-not-call list, and state residents can apply by going to www.nocallsplease.com. As far as I'm concerned, that's YOUR right to decide if you don't want to be pulled away from dinner every night. So go sign up. I did months ago, and my call volume has decreased dramatically. Good day."

"event","So I was reading about this Capgras syndrome, which is a psychological disorder that prevents its victim from recognizing his or her image in a mirror or anything reflective, for that matter. The results can be rather damaging. One of the victim saw another woman's reflection when she looked in the mirror that she became convinced there was another female pining for her husband. Eventually, her husband realized his wife did not have the problem when she looked into small mirrors, like the one on her compact. So he figured if started with that mirror and eventually worked up in size, she'd eventually be able to accept that the image in the mirror was hers. It worked.

Anyhow, the syndrome has to do with a person's sense of connectivity to his or her own image. If a person is so far removed from the reflection in the mirror, the person's brain will not permit that individual to see his or her true image. Thus, the reflection of a person who does not exist. Actually, all of us have some form of Capgras, but generally it's mild. For example, you know when you have a dream about a familiar place or person, and that place or person looks totally different from real life. But you know in your mind it is that place or person. That's because as you're dremaing, your sense of connectivity to the subject has waned.

It made me think a bit about my own image, which never has pleased me. I'm not thrilled with the way I look as I don't feel I'm naturally attractive. Of course, I'm also very hard on myself, and other people have assured me my self image is completely out of whack. I've mentally retorted with the person is only telling me that to be nice or to spare my feelings. But my image in the mirror is my own, and I guess I've accepted that more than I realized. At least I hope so ...

So that's it. It's Thursday, I'm really looking forward to going home and getting some things done, and I might even hit the South Side tonight. I'll probably go by myself, although that's not by choice. Maybe as I'm passing by a storefront window I'll realize I'm OK with what I see."

"event","Here's what really sucks: It's 11:50 a.m. and I'm sitting at work with absolutely fucking nothing to do. I designed this week's CD review pages as far as I could. I'm waiting on two more reviews before I can finish and I have ... hmm, let me check my watch ... about 30 hours to get it done. So there's going to be significant downtime. Technically I could leave, go home and nap this afternoon. I've been here since 5:30 this morning, so I've been in damn near a complete woek day. Plus tomorrow I'll be here a little bit longer, so it'll all balance out.

But I figured in my bone-dry boredom I'd try to annoy myself further by thinking of the multitude of things that get on my nerves. This should be fun ...

* I can't stand it when people don't take turns at stop signs. You always get the asshole who figures he's not waiting so he'll follow the guy in front of him, almost as if his car is attached to the one preceding, through the stop sign. Those people don't deserve to breathe.

* I do this all the time, but I hate poor planning that winds up affecting multiple people. Like here in McKeesport, the on ramp to the Duquesne-McKeesport bridge is closed this week. Just this week. No big deal, right? Well, all traffic trying to access the bridge to go to Duquesne, West Mifflin, Homestead, Pittsburgh, etc., must travel through downtown McKeesport (and all 73 traffic lights), over the Jerome bridge, over the Mansfield bridge and through Dravosburg.

Here's where more problems arise: Yesterday, traffic on the Jerome bridge was limited to one lane each way for an annual (cue majestic trumpets) BRIDGE INSPECTION. Not only that, but only one lane was open on the Mansfield bridge, thus meaning vicious, bloody traffic snarls ... at 12:35 in the afternoon. So, um, why not hold off that inspection until next week when 75 percent less cars will be taking to the bridge? Is that not logical? I'm pretty sure the structure poses no threat of crumbling and sinking into the river, so for the sake of fuck, can we not wait ONE FREAKIN' WEEK?!

* I dislike being approached by a sales clerk .5 seconds after I walk into a store. I have one foot through the door and it's like ... ""Can I help you sir?"" Um, yeah, you can shut up. Seriously, let me get lost amid your store's product before I ask you to lead me to the promised land.

* That my behavior is a problem for people bewilders me. I'm pretty normal. Every now and again I'll have a really bad day at work and need to curse. Or I'll throw a notebook into an empty space of the room where no one can be hurt. I don't think that's unreasonable. But there's one person here that, when I visibly get upset, says, ""Well, Brian's getting ready to swear and throw things again."" I really want to say, ""You know what? You're right. And I'm starting with your fucking computer."" But I don't because that would be unreasonable and wrong. Would it be soul cleansing? You betcha. But I'm in control. And it's not like I'm slamming my head through windows or kicking holes in walls. A tossed notebook is on everyone's resume. Am I wrong?

* I hate when people push food on me. Here, you need to eat. Have this bowl of stuffing. How about no. Yeah, I'm kinda skinny and built in a manner where most adult T-shirts don't fit me very well (I have two kick-ass Steelers T-shirts that are boys x-tra large), but I'm not sick, deprived, depressed, reclusive, manic, vomiting, crazy. None of that. I eat three meals a day, I eat in between meals, but I exercise, drink lots of juice and try to be sensible. It doesn't bother me when my parents get concerned because they know the shit that I've been through, but really, all's OK. In fact, I'm dreaming about an Eat n' Park smiley face waffle as I write this.

OK, that's enough. I feel better now. I can leave work, go home and eat a fun lunch, then take a siesta. Adios chicos and chicas."

In a weird way, I know everything. I have a really bizarre sense about things. And even when it seems I'm fooled, I'm not. I can play along, too.

That being said, let me state that it's powerful and very sad when you realize who your friends are and who's only keeping you around because the ride is familiar. I might get hurt and show that on the surface, but sometimes I'm smiling on the inside. And the reason for that is I am cognizant of the ulterior motives that are in effect or the true reason certain things transpire. I'll let it play out.

* There's a lot of leaves on the street.

* I noticed there's a little more water built up in my leaves-clogged gutters than usual. That or there's just more leaves. I haven't figured it out yet.

* The puddles were kind of deep when I was walking to work. That forced me to cuff my boot-cut pants in order to avoid soggy pant legs. That always sucks.

* A few pears fell of my tree overnight. The squirrels got to them before I could. Greedy little bastards.

Because if you've been watching TV news all day (like I'm forced to do in my profession/life sentence), then you know Hurricane Isabel is here, and damn it she'll eat your children. And you! So in the effort of establishing good sense, all the news networks have sent reporters, you know like real people, to the shores of the East Coast to prove to us that, yes Virginia, there really is a hurricane.

I watched Al Roker get whipped to and fro in the violent winds. I also watched the poor bastard from CNN, who was forced to don some stupid blue rain protection suit, go running up the shore of some beach in North Carolina as the winds got just a little too strong. ""Here ya go, Kip. Wear this blue thing. That way you can forget dying with dignity."" I guess the news networks feel we won't really believe there's a hurricane unless they send a reporter to die in the thing.

But they're making this storm sound like armageddon (a word I know that is supposed to be capitalized, but why? I ask why?), so I'm going to the store in a moment to get peanut butter, water purification tablets, bread, beverages, flashlights, flares, a Swiss army knife and a machine gun (just in case).

"event","Before I get into the details of Dennis' wedding, I present you a scenario: Have you seen the Dell computer ad where the annoying interns are leaving and turn off the lights, only to piss off the night crew? Why are the interns the last Dell employees out of the building at night? Doesn't that worry you? The big-wigs are cutting out at 2 to play racquet ball or shoot up, yet the 18-year-old interns Brian wants to kill are there slaving. No wonder our Dell at work blows. But I digress...

OK, the wedding. Dan and I arrived in our tuxes (I couldn't have looked more like an ass) at about 1:20 p.m. The wedding was at 2:30. Oh, on the way, we got behind a guy who had a RATT license plate. Fucking awesome. So the service went pretty well, except I could not stop laughing. My friend Jason owed me one. As kids, I used to make him laugh hysterically in church, leading to much scolding of both of us by old ladies. Anyway, as we were going out to start the service, the pastor said, ""OK, let's roll."" Jason turned to me and said, ""You know what happened last time someone said let's roll."" That was it. To make matters worse, the kids in the church made a Sept. 11 commemorative poster, and every time I saw the Twin Towers exploding, well, I busted out into laughter.

I know, anyone who doesn't know me thinks I'm scum of the earth for that previous paragraph. No, Sept. 11 was not funny, and it shook me so badly I went to therapy for months in order to feel comfortable in public and accept the fact I can die at any time, even via terror attack. So there.

Anyway photos afterward took forever. The camera man had this wicked ass catch phrase. While reminding people to look at the camera, he said ""If you can't see the lens, the lens can't see you.""

The reception was a blast, maybe the most fun I've had all year. There are reasons for that I shall not discuss here. :-) But anyhow, there was much dancing to lame ass songs. A cart carrying shot glasses was knocked over, hot candle wax accidentally was spilled all over my pants by an errant arm, and someone threw up right next to my car. We left at like 10, about 6 hours after the reception began. 

It was awesome seeing people I haven't been around in years, like my old pal Kap. He and I got into plenty of trouble in high school, and he even has on tape us being chastised by a priest with a Bostonian accent. He told me he still has the tape. I must hear it. Plus, Jason and I used to be best of friends, and we had a cool time catching up. We vowed to hang out again soon. 

So the wedding was fantastic, and even though the Steelers got their asses embarrassed the next day, it made for a cool weekend. A tired one, but a cool one. I'll put some photos from the wedding on here later in the week.

By the way, I'm not voting in the presidential election. Being an independent, I won't get to cast vote for my favorite Democractic fool, nor will I get to rubber stamp more killing by voting for Bush. John Kerry? Sorry, but Andrew Jackson already was president. Howard Dean? I actually want to kick his ass. I hate everyone running, so I'm not participating. Have a fun day."

Such is life, so I will go about my business quietly, with a determination to finish without and glaring errors. But I'm thinking too much this morning ...

* I return today to the dentist who single-handedly (or is that single-drilledly?) destroyed the nerve in my upper left wisdom tooth. Today, I will allow him (and my insurance provider will pay him) to go batshit with his drill again and tear more holes in my mouth. I will get novacaine, which is kind of OK. Afterward, I will be in utter, total pain. I'd go home and take a percocet if it wasn't for fear that my drug-rejecting body will force me to have delirium tremors.

* I've discovered the wonder that is cotton candy flavored Bubblicious gum. Do you know how to suck bubbles? If so, do that while chewing cottom candy gum. It tastes oddly like a Krispy Kreme glazed doughnut.

* Neverland Ranch is the only other place where I could get away with writing ""suck bubbles.""

* The fake cappuccino machine at the Get Go store across the street from where I work has the most kick-ass caramel steamers. They're packed with sugar and make my stomach hurt for hours after finishing. But damn it's worth it.

* My friend Dennis, who I've known for 25 years since we got mocked ad naseum in kindergarten, is getting married Saturday. I'm in the wedding. That means I have to wear a tux. I also went to the bachelor party, which was a thoroughly amusing experience (it gave me plenty of ideas for a fabulous film noir production). The wedding is going to be a riot. I've also been told by his fiancee of her family's redneck tendencies. Yeah, someone's getting shot. With a deer rifle.

* Listen to Raveonettes' ""Love Destroys Everything."" I was so depressed afterward, I wanted to burn down a Hallmark.

* I just saw an ad last night for a pay-per-view concert featuring ""supergroup"" Asia, To anyone out there who bought an Asia record at one time or another: What the fuck were you thinking?

* I went to the Renassaince festival over the weekend locally, and some young girl working a skills booth convinced me to throw ninja stars at a giant piece of ply wood decorated with painted, escaping people. I asked the young waif this question, and she could not answer. So I turn to you. Can you detail for me the role and history of ninjas in Renassaince times?

* I have run out of fun things to eat for dinner. I literally am out of ideas. Can anyone help? I can cook like a son of bitch."

But the day HAS sucked. I learned my grandmother has to put down her dog, Max, tomorrow. He's 16, and he's a sweetheart. In his younger days, he was able to hop around a room on his hind legs. Plus, he was the friendliest little guy in the world. In my high school and college days, I would cut my grandmother's lawn on weekends, and Max always would sit with me as I drank cold glasses of iced tea on the porch. I'll miss him.

For those of you wondering why I'd worry so much about an animal, I ask you to have a heart. And also understand that I am at the point with humanity where I truly miss animals more than people. Do what you wish with that little piece of information.

To add to things, my little 2-year-old cousin has childhood rheumatoid arthritis, which is a chronic disease that afflicts the joints. This was just learned in the past few days. I can't tell you how sad this makes me. I hurt not only for the poor little girl who never will know a normal or comfortable life, but also for her parents, who are fantastic people. It makes me wonder why these things are allowed to happen. What did this little girl do to deserve such a thing? I know I've done some things wrong in my life, and I certainly would deserve this affliction over her. Yet it leaves me confused and grateful at the same time that I am healthy. Please keep this girl in your prayers or your thoughts.

So this has been a downer of a post, so I'll leave you with some good things. At work, I arrived today to find review copies of the new Iron Maiden and A Perfect Circle CDs. That's good. Plus, I interviewed Juliana Hatfield, who was just wonderful and very gracious. Plus tonight I bought the new Raveonettes CD. Very good, very intoxicating stuff. Music is a wonderful addiction. I did pass the ""Rushmore"" DVD because, and you'll think I'm nuts, but the case was damaged. I can get a better copy.

I also want to say I'm lucky to have a tiny handful of good friends who called to say happy birthday. No, that's not some kind of weird requirement. It's just nice to know some people care and remember you. But it's also interesting to see who forgets. Oh well. There's more important things in life."

I went to Laga in Oakland tonight with some friends and had a pretty good time. We saw Rainer Maria, a really good band that just isn't my thing, and they were fun. Maybe I like Rainer Maria more than I thought. I saw that Chimaira is coming Sept. 26, so that'll be a must.

So here I am a week or so later, and the left side of my face feels like I took a slug to the cheek. My tooth is KILLING ME!

I've been taking Advil (mmm, coating tastes like candy) which seems to work, but as night comes and I get tired, the pain comes flying back.

It's 3:30 again, and here I am. I could drive a long distance and not blink. Fuck the Starbucks. I could do it on water. So since I'm pissed and awake and beginning to go from numb to hostile because of all the cold medicine, I thought I'd share my random thoughts with you.

* There's a giant spider on my porch. I hate spiders. I threw a giant cup of cold water at him the other day. I'm talking like 32 ounces of tidal wave. Did he leave? No. Yes, I should just suck it up and stick him on a shovel and throw him in my neighbor's bushes. I won't kill him because I'll feel guilty. Why won't he just leave?

* I turn 29 in 9 days. People keep saying, ""Oooo, you'll be 30 next year!"" No fuck. You serious? Wait let me ... hmmm... born in '74 ... it'll be 2004 ... 2004 minus 1974 is ... HOLY SHIT! 30! You're right! Kill me! My life's over! I really could not care any less that I'll be 29 in 9 days much less 30 in a year. It means nothing. So stop bothering me.

* I'm really a nice person. I just want to sleep.

* My dog is sound asleep. I figure on an average day he logs about 20 to 21 hours of sleep time. He eats for abot 20 minutes, he pees for about 20 minutes (no kidding), then the rest of the time he spends trying to wake me up from MY sleep.

* Steelers linebacker Joey Porter got shot Sunday. In Denver. In the ass cheek. Seven days before the season opener. Who gets shot in Denver? I thought the only thing that happened in Denver was Pete Coors walked around in the mountains talking about his dad.
But seriously, at least he's OK. Football is so secondary (no, seriously), and life means a hell of a lot more.

* Well, look who's up. It's the dog. Oh, and he's stretching. And whining. He has to pee. Let the clock start ... now.

* I need money for a new tattoo. I have one. I want another. I'm so awake I could handle the needles and not even blink. Then I'd cry for the next three days. 

* I don't feel well.

* I'm beginning to believe I don't need a woman. Maybe what I need is another dog. You know, forget this one. Way too many jokes at my expense just sitting there.

* There's people who simply aren't worth devoting your time and energy to because all they'll do is exhaust you of your strength. All you'll do is give in an altruistic fashion and always find youself fending for youself when your time of need arrives. I see that now. So good-bye to you. You aren't worth it. You know who you are. And if you don't ... you will soon. Silence is lovely.

* Why do I always sign my Live Journal? No shit it's by Brian. No, it's some guy Gene. He's the new overlord of your Live Journal. I need to go to sleep."

"event","Queensryche sucks. At least they do now. I reviewed their new CD ""Tribe"" and let me tell you, it's a piece of shit. It's a post-9-11 look at the U.S. Wow, I can't believe no one thought to do something like that before. ... 

 Also got the new Sepultura. I only listened to the first track, but I miss Max doing vocals. Now, even though the music sounds good, the vocals are ordinary.

 I am seeing Anthrax and Lacuna Coil Friday night, which should be superfly. I was supposed to see Iron Maiden and Anthrax in 1991, and I broke my ankle days before the show. I was in high school and did not have a license yet, so I was pretty well screwed. If I break my neck before then, I'll drag my ass there. Too bad Lamb of God dropped off the bill. They're completely amazing.

"event","Yeah, not like anyone actually has been reading this. I've told no one for the EXACT purpose I write about now. I haven't updated. So for anyone who stumbles on here.... here's what I have to say.

July sucked. Badly. At the time, I thought it was really good. At the time I was really happy. At the time I thought all was right. None of that was true. At all. Turns out July was one big 31-day block of fucking horrible decisions. One after another after another after another. The only good decision I made was buying that package of sugar lemon cookies at Wal-Mart. That was an AWESOME decision.I guess I can just hope that as long as none of those decisions has long-term effects (and I don't think any will), then I can just write it off as being temporarily insane.

 See, part of the reason I feel this way is I'm usually a really good judge of people. I still am. Problem this time is even though I knew a person I was hanging out with was totally not worth spending a moment with, I did anyway. Lonely? Perhaps. Hoping things would change? Not sure. I was pretty certain they would not. So now that I know this, I feel like an ass because that person decided she did not want to spend any more time with me even though I was scremaing for my exit the entire time. I need to take matters into my won hands from now on.

 Also, this person could not have been any less truthful or less upfront with me. I write those people off permanently. So guess what I did. Total write off, yo. Maybe that's cold. I don't care. That's how I am and always will be. I could not have done more stuff or been more understanding of this person, yet I get the blow off treatment. So now I write you off. You don't even exist.

 Got some good CDs. New Arch Enemy is sweet as hell. I like the new Nevermore and a disc by this band called The Bled. Music's getting so much better cause now I know where to find it. Happy now. Now.

"event","So yesterday, friend Dan and I went to Ozzfest in Cleveland. I'm from Pittsburgh. I'm not sure what I was thinking there. I show up and there's one, not two, ticket waiting for me. So Dan's screwed. But some guy sold him one for $20. We were there an hour and it started raining like a motherfucker. The field was all muddy, and the Datsuns sucked. I couldn't even see them. The stage is all dark brown, and that combined with bright sun means I couldn't even see anynone on the main stage. We left at like 4:30, some three hours before Manson came on. I'll catch him in Pittsburgh.

Tonight I'm supposed to interview Dave Murray from Iron Maiden. That's like a huge deal for me. Well, the band's PR company gave me the wrong interview time, and I missed him! Woo! Hopefully they can reschedule. They better reschedule."

"event","I'm going out with Todd. 

I can't believe it. I mean, he's my best freind, and he's been asking me out for a while. But this week was just so romantic. He sent me flowers, and made me a mix CD dedicating each song to me. 

He's been telling me he wants to marry me too. Gay marriage is legal... if Kerry is elected. But everythings going a little toom fast. 

I want to be with Todd, yes. And yes I've known him since highschool. 

But still. 

I adore him. I love you Todd!

I feel light and fluffy.

"event","I saw Todd today. I had a lot of fun. He brought me to his studio after classes and took some pictures of me. He's really a great photographer. 

Afterwards, he took me down to this beautiful cemetary and showed me some beautiful gardens that surrounded the tombstones. 

""Why don't you quit school, leave that fuckin dorm, and come live with me? I'll take care of you.""

When he said that it was a huge mood breaker. And he knew it was too, because he leaned in to kiss me and I pulled away from him. 

I wanted to kiss him, just not after he said something like that. He knows how much school means to me, I love it. 

I don't think he's mad though, because he dropped me off at my dorm and gave me a hug good-bye. I think he just doesn't know what to do. 

He wants me, I know because he told me. 

...Do I want him too?

I'm a man who doesn't know what he wants... unless it comes down to someone like Conor Oberst. I'd do him in a second."

"event","I just made my own livejournal. I really need to have one, it'll help me calm down a bit. I'm going to join the boyskissing community. Todd told me to, and as the stupid passive guy I am, I do whatever Todd tells me. 

At least I'm not killing myself."

"event","When Rosa and I left for the Mediterranean, we had no idea that we would come across her family in the Oasis. Her family was giving rides to the nice visitors. Aren't they wonderful?

I stubbed my little camel toe on a rock, and I had to see the doctor, oh my goodness. He wrapped it up for me, and then I went off with Rosa for some lovely sea food in the ocean. What a wonderful view. 

Jamie and Megan are always on my mind, they are so wonderful to have adopted me. I feel bad that I do not see them much, but they tell me that they still love me which makes me glisten from my furry nose to my scruffy tail. 

I think I might ask Rosa to marry me. I am very much in love with this beautiful camel. We will make lovely baby camels together, and take them backpacking across the world. Oh my goodness.

"event","So my poor little camel toes are so very sore. I have been back packing across Europe for several weeks. Rosa and I are still very much so in love. It is nice to have a furry little face to wake up next to in the morning. Though, sometimes she does spit on me in our sleep. 

I purchased a beautiful rug in El Savador the other day. The man who sold it to me tried to tell me it could fly. I am not a stupid camel, you know!

Next time Rosa and I go back to Florida to visit our two very best friends, we are going to have them scan our wonderful pictures from all of our vacations. Our toes are too big to use such little machines. We do not want to break anything. So I am very sorry that you must have to wait.

Rosa's parents seem to like me, which makes me very happy in the humps. 

My friends Megan and Jamie sent me what my name means too! My name is of Arabic origin and it means ""beloved one"". How very nice.

I must be going now. My nephew is trying to spit on my girlfriend!

"event","I woood like to start by apologyzing for my lack of camel updates. I have been learning how to play American Ping Pong! It is quiet a sport. I do think I could beat Lt. Dan and his friend Forest. Me and my girlfriend Rosa are quiet the Oasian athletes. Oh yes. They made us special trophies. My first one. How special. I will have to put it into a case down at my friend Abara's Quickie Mart for all to see. I do want to say happy birthday to Jamie, and I hope she liked my special heehaw that I have sent her.

I am so glad to be back to town with j and m. tomorrow night is ppv and I get to meet sir styles for first time. will take many pictures.

The carrot oil will do that. I only wish there were sand there at the pool. I miss my Oasis...my Home. Someday, I shall return..but until then, I shall rock it with my girls, j and m. GODDAMIT WOMAN'S!! HEHE-HAW

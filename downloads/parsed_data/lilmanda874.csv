Dear Alcohol:

First & foremost, let me tell you that I'm a huge fan of yours. My friend, 
you always seem to be there when needed. The perfect post-work cocktail, a 
beer at the game, and you're even around in the
holiday's hidden inside chocolates as you warm us when we're stuck in the 
midst of endless family gatherings. However, lately I've been wondering 
about your intentions. While I want to believe that you have my best 
interests at heart, I feel that your influence has led to some unwise 
consequences:

1. Phone calls: While I agree with you that communication is important, I 
question the suggestion that any conversation of substance or necessity 
takes place after 2 a.m. Why would you make me call those 
ex-boyfriends/girlfriends when I know for a fact they do not want to hear from me during the 
day, let alone all hours of the night?

2. Eating: Now, you know I love a good ! meal, but why do you suggest that 
I eat a taco with chili sauce, along with a big Italian meatball and some 
stale chips (washed down with WINE & topped off with a Kit Kat after a few 
cheese curls & chili cheese fries)? I'm an eclectic eater, but I think you 
went too far this time.

3. Clumsiness: Unless you're subtly trying to tell me that I need to do 
more yoga to improve my balance, I see NO need to hammer the issue
home by causing me to fall down. It's completely unnecessary, and the 
black & blue marks that appear on my body mysteriously the next day are beyond 
me. Similarly, it should never take me more than 45 seconds to get the 
front door key into the lock.

4. Furthermore: The hangovers have GOT to stop. This is getting 
ridiculous. I know a little penance for our previous evening's debauchery may be in 
order, but the 3pm hangover immobility is
completely unacceptable! My entire day is shot. I ask that, if the proper 
precautions are taken (water, vitamin B, bread products, aspirin) prior to 
going to sleep/passing out face down on the kitchen floor with a bag of 
popcorn, the hangover should be minimal & in no way interfere with my daily 
activities.

Alcohol, I have enjoyed our friendship for some years now & would like to 
ensure that we remain on good terms. You've been the invoker of great 
stories, the provocation for much laughter, and the needed companion when I 
just don't know what to do with the extra money in my pockets. In order to 
continue this friendship, I ask that you
carefully review my grievances above & address them immediately. I will 
look for an answer no later than Thursday 3pm (pre-happy hour)on your 
possible solutions & hopefully we can continue this fruitful partnership.

Thank you,
Your biggest fan

"event","So i can tell this is going to be the longest week ever!!!!! It's only monday night and i'm bored as shit. Damn the boys for finally getting real jobs!!! and damn the rest of the guys for being at myrtle beach and calling me everyday and telling me how great it is. you don't understand how many times i've thought about driving down there for a few days. i want to so bad, but just not alone. today i really didn't do a whole lot. got up around 10, layed out til about 1230, watched tv, made a pork chop dinner, cleaned up, and went to go play 4-squares with ramsey, heath, bray, bankert, and jake. i thought it was going to be a lot more fun-like it was in elementary school, but we definitely lost interest after about 15 minutes. came home watched a lil football and family guy. now i think i'm going to read my book until i fall asleep. tomorrow i have a dentist appointment at 10 then i'm probably going to lay out again....and that's about all i got so far. i've done as much cleaning and laundry as i possibly can to keep myself busy. i wish myrtle beach wasn't so far away!!! it's so nice down there....so much better than ocmd. oh well, laying out on my deck is as close as i am going to get to being down there. 

to amanda and dani,
    i'm really sorry to hear about your lost. my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family. i know you are strong people and will get through this. and like peters said, the drinking team will be reunited soon. until then, take care! love you both!

peace for now........"

"event","So I am having a lot of trouble remembering what all happened this week. Monday i ran a lot of errands-got a lot of things for the apartment. Then that night I went over to bray's friend's house to hang out.  He wanted to go to bed early so we left there and just went back to bray's. Tuesday, I went to Park City with mom for the day and i think i just went and hung out at bray's and wednesday i just worked then hung out at bray's later that night. On thursday i had to work all day-boring as usual and didn't make money as usual. That night i had planned on staying in and just chillin at my house. Of course that didn't happen. My phone rang around midnight and it was bankert saying ramsey's car broke down. So being the nice friend i am i went to go help them out. little did i know, there was a huge whole in the gas tank so we were out there for about 2 hours trying to fix it. Afterwards we just went back to heath's house to chill for a little. On friday i went out to dinner with chelsea--good times. Then i went out to jakes to hang out.  also on friday, during the day, i received a phone call from the commons saying it's going to be another week til we can move in. i really wanted to freak out on them but once i thought about it, i'm sure they are getting shit from a lot of people and hearing about everyone's problems so i didn't bother to waiste my breath.  I'm just so frustrated cause it's another week of not working, which i really can't afford because of the freakin rent. and plus my parents have been on my shit the last few days for going out everynight and not coming home til 4 or 5 in the morning. they basically ruined my time saturday night. They were so pissed that i didn't get home til 530am saturday moring, from friday night....and when my mom tried waking me up she said my room smelled like alcohol. So before i left saturday they were bitching at me to not be late and not drink.  So i just had that in the back of my head the whole time at jake's so i ended up leaving there at like 1am saturday night. Oh well, i know i needed a break so it felt good waking up at a decent hour today.  I also stayed in tonight-cleaned up the room and went to visit the grandparents.  Oh and on friday night....i decided not to tell the guys that i am going to be home for another week-very entertaining.  I first told them i wasn't even going to go out to jake's. ramsey yelled at me on the phone and i told him i hung out with them all week and i'll see them when the come to visit me in wc. I was just going to show up at jake's but i wanted to make sure they were there so i did call and said i was just going to come out for a little bit, but wanted to leave at 11 to go finish packing and because i had to get up early to drive to wc in the morning. So of course, as soon as i get there they start pressuring me to drink but i had good self-control.  At about 10pm heath challenged me to drink 5 beers in an hour, before i had to go. Well, at about 1030 i told him to come over to me and i whispered to him that i'm staying for another week. his reaction-priceless. then i eventually told bankert then ramsey.  haha, they were a lil pissed at first but then got over it. 

I guess it was a good week and weekend. This weekis probably going to be very boring without working, but i'm trying to keep myself busy. Tomorrow i want to get up early to lay out then chelsea and i want to go play tennis in the afternoon. and i'll probably be cooking dinner so it's ready for everyone when they get home from work.  wednesday i might take a day trip with chelsea to west chester. i have to fill out an availibiliy form for work and i wanna check out the apartment.  that's all i have planned for right now....hopefully something interesting comes up. peace for now..."

"event","So this weekend was my last full weekend home for the summer and it def was a good one. I was worried there wasn't going to be anything to do friday night cause when i talked to heath during the afternoon he really wasn't sure if anything was going on. But anyways, my dad came home from work and i asked him to go up the street and get me a case of natty light. Then ate dinner once my mom got home from work then called kip. him, eric, and heath were out at dana's (kip's sister) boyfriend's house. I really wasn't srue if i wanted to go out there or not but figure what the hell. better than drinking alone. haha. Once i got out there eric and heath had already left so i hung out with the rest of them for about 2 hours. Played some cards, and listened to ben play the guitar. Decided to call heath and him and ramsey were over at some kid's house that lives right down the street from ramsey. Showed up at the party, and felt awkward cause there def were some girls there that i do not get along with so i only played one game of pong then me, ramsey, and heath walked over to jill's house. Had a really good time there, chels-banger and her sis were there. Ended up getting really drunk and not going to bed til 5am and had to wake up at 930 to go to work. And def was still drunk in the morning. d

Saturday i had to work a double shift which kind of sucked but i kind of enjoyed it cause it's been so long since i have served on a weekend since i started bartending....and i really like the fast-pace-busy shit. whitey was suppose to have a bonfire that night, but it def rained on that parade. so after work i went home, changed, and ate some food. whitey's was pretty chill, but still a really good time. it was me, whitey, chels-banger for a lil, bankert, shane, kyle, heath, bray, kip, and ramsey. Played some pong, flip cup, and flip cup with no hands. ended up getting really drunk and shit started with throwing beer cans, then i accidently hit ramsey in the face so like usual he acted all pissed off and sat in his car. well all the guys went to go talk to him and little did i know they were planning to get  me back. ramsey got out of the car, grabed a full beer, heath and kyle grabbed ahold of me and ramsey dumped the beer all over me. ahh def sucked but fun in a way. so after some more throwing beer on people, we called truce. not too much longer after that i headed home. got to bed around 430am and once again had to wake up at 930 for work. this time it wasn't too bad, i did wake up late but at least i was sober.  i worked til 4, came home, ate pizza with the fam, mom and sis went to go pick up some crabs, ate those and then pretty much just chilled and watched tv for the rest of the night. very relaxing...def needed due to the lack of sleep this weekend. 

looking forward to saturday so bad!!! i'm hoping to have all my shit packed up friday night so i can go out and get drunk with the crew my last night in sg and just wake up, jump in the car, and head to my new apartment!!! Alright i really need some sleep. bye for now."

"event","So not much has been going on. Same old, same old. 

Monday, came home from the beach. The ride wasn't too bad. I slept most of the way and chels drove for me...which is a good thing, cause i def would have gotten a dui. Didn't really do much that night, just hung out around the house and relaxed. 

Tuesday, had to work 9-1. nice and short. after work I went out the galleria...bad idea. Spent money i didn't have. But i finally got my phone fixed. Had dinner with the fam then went to go hang out at chelsea's with her and vanessa for the night.  We had a good time-watched the videos from senior week, the beach last year and also some random night at chelsea's. Def good movies. 

Wednesday, had to work 11-3, again nice and short. Didn't do shit after work. Later that night my mom followed me into the garage to drop off my car and on the way home i talked to her into buying me a case of natty light. Came home and went over to heath's house to figure out what we wanted to do. When i got there, Ramsey was already there so I went with them over to Bray's. We ended up going over to some girl's house that bray knew-bunch of freaks. But i had beer and the boys got free vodka so you can't really complain. The guys ended up getting pretty drunk and we were all outside having a good time when the neighbor yelled at us.  We took that as our cue to leave.  Decided on the way home that we were going to stop by my house to get the rest of the beer then go drink at heath's.  I felt kind of weird sneaking into my house and taking a case, but we had nothing else to drink.  We def had an interesting time at heath's. Me, Ramsey, and Heath sat around talking about the most random shit. I found out which girl's they dated shaved, gave good head, etc. I basically just sat there and laughed at their drunken comments...all in all, a good night.

Thursday, got up at like 2 in the afternoon. I was kind of pissed off cause i wanted to get up early to mow the lawn but instead i had to do it in the middle of the afternoon when it felt like it was 100 degrees out. After that, my dad and i decided we were going to head up the Susquehanna speedway to watch the races. My dad has been wanting to go cause one of his buddies races. So we drove up there and hung out with heath and eric, drew stopped up at some point to say hi.  It was kind of boring, but it was my first time at that particular race track and the boys said they always suck there, they do a lot of stupid shit. And it sucked cause it was really dusty. So every time the sprint cars went around the 4th turn we got covered with a blanket of dirt. But i think my dad enjoyed his first time at the races.

I basically haven't really done much today either. Woke up at a decent hour, went and finally got my hair done then went tanning. Now i'm just playing around on my new computer, downloading my pics from my digital camera and figured i should just update while i have nothing else to do.  

Hopefully there will be something fun to do tonight, there usually is--just as long as there is drinking involved. Maybe i'll finally take ramsey's beer bong back to him so they can do some of those tonight. That always makes the night interesting.  Alright craig you all later. peace."

"event","So the weekend started with nothing to do and no work for me. I was a little upset cause i wanted to actually go somewhere but no one really wanted to. I called Heath on thursday asking him if he wanted to go to canada for a few days, def denied the offer. Understandable with his situation with fines. We also planned to have a case race on Friday...me, ramsey, and heath against bray, shuck, and jess. On friday i really didn't do much, went over to bray's for the case race and shuck never called or showed up, which i understand cause there team sucked and we def would have kicked their asses. The 5 of us just sat around, played pong, and cards. Def a good time, expecially when we got drunk and decided we were going to go to the beach the next day. i really have no idea who thought of it but all i know is sat morning i woke up and called everyone and in a few hours we were on our way to ocmd. The car ride was a lot of fun. Bad part is it usually takes 3 1/2-4 hours to get down there and it took us 7. But we def kept ourselves entertained while sitting in traffic. Once we got down there we did a lil hotel shopping, just decided to stay at the admiral on 9th street. Place was alright, nothing special, but cheap. I guess when you do spur of the moment shit, everything can't go perfect. Cause we got down there around 930. Bray, jess, and laura were about an hour behind us and of course they had all the beer. Me and Ramsey def were not happy people. Thanks to Kip for putting me on speaker phone at jake's house while they were playing flip cup, so i could hear the sound of drinking. haha. Especially cause they got lost and pulled over which took up more time. They finally got down there around midnight. Overall def a good weekend. Sunday, it wasn't too nice out...no laying out on the beach weather. So we were forced to sit in our room and da-rink. Good idea! I got pretty drunk before dinner. I think everyone was, cause we were having such a good time. After dinner is when i got really drunk. At like 3 in the morning we decided to go walk to boardwalk and once we got on the boardwalk we decided let's walk on the beach instead. So we're running around in the sand and of course before you know it we're in the water. It was so much fun. Kind of scary cause it was all dark and annoying swimming in the ocean with jeans on but so fun. Went back, took showers, and drank some more. Oh we then had our big discussion about facing the faucet or back towards the faucet when you shower. Thanks to all the craigs i called and for their input. It was an interesting conversation. Not much else happened, played a lot of throw off a cliff, one-night stand, and marry questions with chels and ramsey. But after that pretty much passed out. work up at like 1045 to realize i slept through my alarm. I had to get up at 630 to call of work and def was too drunk. Oh well, they were cool about it. that about sums up the random beach trip. 

I'm kind of upset about moving to wc a week later, but what can ya do? I just hope lonestar has some shifts for me to pick up so i'm not sitting around for a week not making any money. We'll see what happens."

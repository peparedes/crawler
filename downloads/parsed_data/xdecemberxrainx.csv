"event","My temper is short this evening. Super-short. The attention span of a rodent short. Or better yet, my OWN attention span short.

Know what I should do? Build a moat, wonderful suggestion! But no. That was not the direction that I was headed in.
I should start keeping my opinions to myself. I mean, really. Especially at school. Someone can say something, I can make a casual response, then someone tells someone who tells someone who tells SOMEONE who turns it into a completely opposite statement, and I have half the skank troup down my throat. 
Fine, so an event like that hasn't happened yet.
But it will. 
But if I DON'T put out my opinion, then, as far as the prying ears of the world know (or, in this case, HEAR), I don't HAVE an opinion. So there is no opinion to be transformed into some sort of ""SHE SAID HE SAID SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS SLUTTY AND I SAID -"" comment.
So I win.
I should do that.
Take that, silly little  ""pupil"" Biznitches.
Oh fine. So they won't notice and won't care. It'd still be fun.

I love the 90's part two comes on this week. Do any of you watch that? I love it. Michael Ian Black is so cool.

"event","I really like going to school now.  I see Allen in the morning, in the hallway after lunch (he always leaves some sort of sweet note in one of my notebooks) and after school. And seeing him makes everything so much better. I look forward to talking to him. I'm so comfortable around him, he actually (seems) to understand me. Which is rare. =) =) =) Sometimes, when I'm talking about something, people just give me a WTF look and say ""Oooo-kay, Erin,"" and kind of back away like I'm polio. But he doesn't do that. =) 
And he's got the most gorgeous eyes.

I'm on the computer a lot less now. I've picked up habits like light working-out, cutting pictures out of magazines and taping them to my walls or notebooks, and listening to more music, booting habits like staying on the computer ALL day to the side. 

I'm super tired during most of school. I can't really pay that much attention. I just doze off, my thoughts go elsewhere. I think I failed my pop quiz on the Immune System.

I'm such a girl. *Hiss*

I need to get my computer serviced already. It isn't even a month old, and it is already slightly wonky. The top disk drive doesn't open sometimes, AIM doesn't work and Windows Media doesn't work. I get this black screen sometimes when I turn it on that says something about a drive or something being missing. Its a lot slower than when I got it, but I haven't got a lot of stuff on it.
So that's how it goes, then? Nothing stays good but for a week, then it gets slow and it needs to be serviced.
I hope all relationships aren't the same way.

As I type this, I remember how funny people stare at me in my typing class. They make comments like ""DANG BOY, DAT GIRL TYPES FAST!"" Like come watch Erin, the experiment who can type. The zoo animal, paraded around like a trophy, who everyone stares at, who can type. No, I cannot type fast. They just type slow. 
And they say things like that about my grades. No, I am not smart. They are all just stupid. I ought to tell them that next time, but why don't I? Question of the day.

A girl died in 1933 by a homicide murderer.He buried her in the ground when she was still alive.The murdered chanted,""Toma sota balcu""as he buried her.Now that you have read the chant,you will meet this little girl.In the middle of the night she will be on your ceiling.She will suffocate you like she was suffocated.Unless you send this to  11 people.

Politik says:
excuse me

Politik says:
but fuck off.


Now, listen closely. If I die tonight by some ghost child who will be on my ceiling and then proceeds to suffocate me, I guess we'll know why. Tell my parents, would you all? I'm sure they'll be awfully curious as to why I'm dead. Just, you know. As most parents would be. And after you enlighten them, tell JL that he's a penis and he needs to stop talking to me. Not that it'd matter, because I'd be dead, wouldn't I? But let him know anyway. C'mon. A favor to the potentially dead-by-ghost-girl-suffocation victim.

And  his writing was way off. No way I'm passing on a forward that says ""homicide murderer."" A-Duh.

Edit: And I've got some more to say about that stupid messege. He said she was buried alive, and that she suffocated. I don't get how one can get suffocated by dirt but whatever. And what if I sleep under the stars? Where's ghost girl gonna be then? Huh? No ceiling, just infinite space. And if she suffocated me ""just like she was suffocated"", it would mean that she would bury me alive. Maybe, and just MAYBE, she could bury me in a pile of clothes in my room, but I doubt that that would kill me. Yeah, I could suffocate in a pile of clothes but I still don't think she's gonna kill me. And aren't ghosts intangible? So how can she even touch me? And I'm still caught up in the ""Homicide Murderer"". Do I even need to point out the wrong things in that little phrase? And ghost girl needs to get her grammar down. Don't get me wrong, I stumble with words all the time. However, when I send a threatening forward, it doesn't end in a fragment. (That is specifically directed at forwards. . . =P)

Yes. I'm convincing myself that there really is not going to be a ghost girl on my ceiling tonight.

I hate forwards. Especially those goo-goo ones that say ""Send this to fifteen people in the next hour and tonight at 11:00, your crush will kiss you!"" and things like that. You know what, if my crush was even IN my room at 11:00 at night, I would so punch him. Hard. I don't appreciate boys in my room at night, who aren't expected, and don't have any permission by anyone in my household to be there.

I will not make a list of anything that I'm not even going to do after the first week. What, am I supposed to make more friends? I refuse to make friends with those stupid media zombies that I'm surrounded by. No. I will not do it. I won't do any of the other ones I can think of, anyway.

I ended up not staying awake till midnight, because I started to feel really sick. So I went to bed early. I had some weird dreams, kind of funny now that I think about it. One was about a cannibalistic model (it was like CSI), one was about me being a Sim (that one was just kinky) and the other one was about the grinch stealing my cat (it was in the style of a Harry Potter computer game). Fine, so I don't have a cat. But in the dream I did. I remember he gave an evil cackle and said ""Well, I've got you another kitty!"" I cried and said ""Are you being sarcastic? 'Cause I'm not in the mood right now."" I remember waking up and thinking that was funny. Not sure why. The grinch kept shooting some weird green goo at me. I still think it's funny, although at the time I was confused. . .

OH MY LORD. OH MY HOLY FREAKING LORD.

I met this boy, Allen.  I like Allen.  Allen likes me.  (How do I know this? It is impossible to keep secrets at my school.)  There was a party tonight, and earlier at school he asked me if I was going.  I said yes, he said cool.
I see him there. We speak, at first in sarcastic tones about what a ""great"" time we're having because the dance/party sucks.  Then we start talking more, and just generally stay by each other, beside for a few five minutes away to talk to other friends every now and then.  My friend Shaina tells me that Allen wants to ask me out but is too scared that I'll say no.  Well, he asks.

Allen: I've got a question. . .
Me: Okay.
Allen: Well...would you like to, sometime, somewhere, like, go out?
Me: Okay!
Allen: Like, seriously?
Me: Like, yeah. OhMiGosh I was hoping you would ask that!

We slow danced. TWICE. It wasn't awkward, although neither of us really knew how to dance.  I suppose you would classify our conversations as ""flirting."" Light wrestling. Lots of talking.  We went outside once because the music was annoying but they made us come back inside.  I guess they were freaked out that we would make out or something.

Before he asked me out, he looks at me. ""Want a kiss?"" I give him a WTF look and he laughs and hands me a hershey kiss.
And then I got out of breath for a minute and he *actually* looks worried and asks me two or three times whether I'm okay or not.
He offered me his seat because I was standing.
He asked me if I was cold.
We hugged before he left.
HOLY CRAP. *Huggles* I feel so fuzzy inside.

It is not official, Allen hasn't said anything about boyfriend/girlfriend and neither have I. I think it's one of those things that just goes unsaid. But I'm awfully sure that we're more than friends AND I'M ABOUT TO EXPLODE."

So today, I start off tired. As usual. I guess that's what I get for going to bed at eleven-thirty on a regular basis.
Halfway through the day, I realize that I have blood on the back of my jeans. Embarassing? Highley. But I had a long shirt and a coat on, so it worked out. Except.
I made the mistake of telling a few of my friends, because I figured they would be able to handle it. I was wrong. They were cracking jokes about me at lunch. My best friend Brittney told me what they said because she sits with them. (I haven't mentioned her before, have I?) *Sigh* Thank Jeebus for my two trusty companions, Chanita and Brittney, who've got my back and don't laugh at me when I'm out of earshot.
So, I end the day, after a second Beta meeting, feeling upset and hurt. I come home and shower to wash away any feelings of self-pity and remaining blood. I get soap and water up my nose. It hurts. And for some reason I taste blood in my mouth right now. What IS it with me and blood today?!?
I mashed my finger in Science. Owies.

Kiesha: Nineteen Eighty-Four? *That's* the title of the book?!?
Me: Yes.
Kiesha: Are you serious??!
Me: Yes.
Kiesha: Well, is it good?
Me: Yes.
Kiesha: Are you *serious*?!
Me: Yes, now get out before I hit you with it.

It's not that the accused a book of being a bad book because of the title. It's because she said it in a pretty rude tone. Kiesha and I usually get along well, but today was just one of those days. And also, I hate people interrupting me when I'm reading to ask a stupid question. ""Is that the title of the book?"" No, it's just plastered onto every page and the cover for the LOOKS of it.

I forgot how exactly my friends and I got into a discussion about sharks, but..
Me: D'you guys know that shark are the only animals that can't have cancer?
Molly and Kelsie: Haha, yeah.
Kiesha: Who CARES?!?! That is so stupid! Does anyone CARE if sharks can have cancer or not?
Me: I care.
Kiesha: Well go swimming in the ocean with sharks then, maybe you won't get cancer.
Kelsie: Uh...Kiesha...Cancer isn't contageous.


I care about sharks. Is that so incredibly wrong? So I find it interesting that of all the species in the world, sharks are the only ones found never to have cancer. SO FORKING SUE ME.

I have to do some minor baby-sitting tonight. An hour or so. A boy and a girl. Ages four and...nine?

And I can still taste that blood.

The mouse on the computer isn't working too well.

I've had a faint on-off stomach ache all day.

I get so annoyed with everyone at school. Most of the girls are too giggly, too narrow-minded and just plain too annoying for me to want to be around. And most of the guys are too wannabe-masculine, too narrow-minded, and just plain annoying for me to want to be around. Almost the same traits. My dad says that I'm too picky about my friends and that I don't make friend easily because I have to consider someone my ""equal"" to be friends with them. I MOST CERTAINLY DO NOT. I merely hope for someone to have most of their brain to have any want to be in their company. Dad says ""You go out of your way to be weird."" I do not. I don't consider myself *that* weird, and even if I did, 'Going out of my way'? I hate it when he says that. I love him like crazy, but I just forking hate it when he says that. It's insulting to me. Everyone treats me like I'm a non-conformist, and I'm not. I conform when I want and I don't conform when I don't want to. It's that freaking simple, people. It's not hard to comprehend. This is not rocket science. It's middle school.

Boo on that blood.

"event","Back. In my own house. With my own bed. I hate not falling sleep in my own bed. The bed I slept in at my grandparent's house was okay, but I hate hotel beds. People have sex in them all the time and little kids piss in them and it's no fun sleeping on the same matress that could have held those previous events. Sure, wash the sheets, but history stains. Stains like ketchup on a wedding dress.

My knee hurts. I don't know why. But it does. The joint hurts. I was sitting in the car, and then it just started to hurt. I'm using the word 'hurt' too much.

Dad interrupted me pouring my soul out to the world to help bring the Christmas boxes downstairs. My mom is watching 'A Wonderful Life'. She loves that movie. I would stop updating to go help set up the tree, but I want to finish this first.

My family has a kick-ass Christmas tree. A lot of families, they have themed Christmas trees. With fancy ornaments that match, and the colors interlock and it ends up looking like it would come out of a Better Home and Gardens magazine. But not my family. Our tree expresses our family. It has cheesy ornaments that my brother and I made when we were just tots, and yet it's got some elegant stuff, too. But it's so cool. It's just a mass of ornaments, different ones, ones we made, ones we bought, ones others bought for us, it doesn't match too much, and it's got multicolored lights instead of solid yellow ones. And that's why I love my family's Christmas tree best of all.

I hate elevators. And I hate automatic toilets. I'm scared of getting stuck in an elevator and dying, and I hate automatic toilets because they're too loud and too quick and I have a fear of them sucking out my bowels.
Don't laugh. One time when I was younger, I was using one, and I didn't know it was automatic. And it flushed. And it was loud. And fast. And it scared me really bad and since then I quiver when pissing.
Not that you wanted to know that.

My grandparent's dog was hit and killed today. Or yesterday. I don't know. It was probably today. I, luckily, was not there to see, because we had already left for home. But when they called up to check up on us they told my dad. It reminded me of when Pokey was hit and killed and I started to cry. And so I said to myself ""It's over, she's dead, get over it."" And then I just kind of cried more. But it wasn't a lot of crying. I was stuck in the backseat of a gas-guzzling car and I didn't want people staring at me because I prefer to cry in peace, so it was more of a sniffle with a few tears.

Pokey was hit a year or two ago. In the spring. I saw her get hit out of the corner of my eye and I ran and picked her up. I had taken the dogs out to go to the bathroom. She was running towards the road and I heard her yelp and I could see the car bounce up and down. Twice. I thought she had only broken her leg or something so I wasn't having a brain malfuction or anything, but when I picked her up she was limp and she wasn't moving and her ribs were at odd angles and I picked her up and ran screaming for mom to my house and I was crying and mom opened the door, ""God, Erin, what do you - OH MY GOD, DAVID, POKEY GOT HIT!"" And we sat there, crying, while the lady who hit her apolgized, and I know she felt so bad, I can't imagine how bad she must have felt. And I realized that no one had told my brother and so I ran up to his room and opened the door and said ""David, Pokey got hit and I think she's dead."" And he looked at me wide-eyed and ran down the stairs and we all sat there crying while the woman who hit her called her husband and her husband came with a shovel and we buried her. We wrapped her up in a bit of blue tarp and we buried her. And I didn't want to go to school the next day but I had to go, and I started crying in math class and my teacher asked me what was wrong and I told her and she gave me some tissues and a hug and told me to go to the bathroom and clean myself up. And I did. And for my mom it was even worse. She was closer to Pokey than any of us. And now I can't even remember where all of Pokey's spots were. She had three big, black spots. And I'll end this entry here because I'm crying and I don't want my mom or anyone to hear me and come see what's wrong because then I'll be embarassed and that never helps.

Edit: Wow, this entry sounds a little depressed. I'm actually very happy at current, maybe a little on the crazy side, but I'm vurry vurry happy. :D *Hugs everyone* I missed you all!"

i dont understand how im so angry at everyone at school for talking to me. they just keep talking, talking, talking, and they seem to care, and i want them out of my life and for them to leave me alone. but at the same time, i'm tired of being ignored. i wouldn't mind an ""excuse me"" when i get pushed around in the hall all the time. maybe i don't like javaris copying off my paper, what am i supposed to do about it? i can only say ""go screw yourself"" so many times before it loses its effect. maybe i get tired of everyone who doesn't see me right in front of them. how is this? ignored, noticed, either way i get angry. 

i hate it when people claim that myself and them are best friends. but then i feel bad, because the person in question is a very very VERY nice person. but i wonder if she, or anyone at school for that matter, totally and completely understands me. a few get me for the most part, but would they be surprised to find out everything that goes on inside my head? yeah.
of course, people over the interent know me slightly better than people at school. its so much easier to express thoughts and feelings in pixelated letters and words on a screen because its harder to stumble over words and get sentences mixed up. you can just backspace and erase what was messed up, like i have done many a time in this entry. why cant life have a backspace key? 

haha. recent discussion:

Me: Mom, can I get contacts?
Mom: We already discussed this, your eyes will keep changing and we will have to buy new ones every six months.
Me: But I don't like my glasses.
Mom: Why not? They look cute.
Me: Because they make me look like a guy and I'm tired of looking like a boy.
Mom: Oh.....oh.....
*awkward silence*

met a boy at school. alan. or allen. i'm voting alan. he's an interesting person, sometimes i get to be around him in the mornings. he's in eighth grade, so a wee little seventh grader such as myself doesn't cross his path. two different halls. i'm trying to wake up earlier so i can get to school ealier so i can talk to him...and other people. but i look forward to talking to him the most, not that we speak much. a few sentences now and then, but nothing direct. oh well."

im leaving for my grandparent's (dad's side of the family) house on the 23rd. we're not flying, instead driving, which will take us a day or two to get there. they have the internet, but only one phone line so i cant get on a lot. i cant use the AOL they have because i'm not registered with AOL, only AIM. they dont have MSN. i wont be able to blare my music. chris and stephen (cousins) are going to be there. they're okay. chunky little boys with round faces. i used to despise them, but then all of us kind of grew up and i got over it.
my grandfather is having heart problems. not fun.
we're coming back home on the 27th. i'll miss you, murfreesboro...

my grandmother (on my mom's side) is celebrating thanksgiving even though she lives in england. see, she used to live in england, but then moved to america but moved back to england when she started having health problems. anywho, while in america, she became very attached to thanksgiving. so she's inviting my english family over to her house and is going to cook a little feast for them. very funny. :p

my quote of the entry. it would be quote of the day but i dont update on a daily basis, because my life is boring and dull. ta daa.

okay. so. my friend had a halloween party. apparently it was fun. well, i wouldnt know, would i? no one ever bothers to invite me. im just loner erin, arent i? never mind that ive been sitting with you at the same lunch table for the whole school year, dont think about me. yeah, chanita and i will just sit there feeling left out while you three rant about how fun it was and who all was there. we're to mother-jumping cool for you guys, anyway. not that i would have gone, i despise being around people. (minus a few exceptions.) but yeah.
we are SO too cool for them.

i checked out anna karenin from the library today. 800 pages. i can do that. i can SO do that. im also reading the mask of zorro, one with pictures of the movie inside. antonio banderas is a fine specimen, even for an old guy.

im taking a high school level SAT in december. at first i wasnt going to do it, but now i am. they say its just to give me ""experience."" i say its just to make me feel dumb.

my coheed cd keeps skipping! *panics* aww, the tree outside the computer room window has turned loverly colors.

election day tomorrow. go nader! go kerry! although i prefer nader, kerry and bush are neck and neck and nader is pretty much non existent at this point. so i suppose i should focus on kerry. but kerry was for the war, and nader wasnt, which i like. i dont believe that the war was right. too many lives have been lost for it to be worth anything. there are other ways to solve problems, and bombing each other really isnt one of them. nader also wishes to remove standardized testing from schools, which im neutral on. he also wants to allow abortions. its not something i agree with, but then again, it IS a woman's right.

i have a new favorite movie. the young frankenstein. i saw it the other night, it rocked. its old and is in black and white. so awesome."

i cant stop listening to always ten feet tall by saves the day. ""You make me feel so tall. I always want to be this tall. Maybe I'll be original. Sometimes things you say just make me think in different ways. So this is my way of saying...I could be the one who's dragged home at night away from my hopeless dreams. You and me will forge some future because we don't want to be waiting for something right to go wrong."" i love saves the day like crazy. i should become a polygamist and marry them all. They are very unique, both musically and lyrically, more lyrically than musically. Rock/Emo according to Windows Media. i recommend them.

i finished The Only Alien On the Planet (Kristen d. randle). The plot was fantastic, a bit cliche and over used, but romantic and mental. It wasn't written exceptionally well or anything. It was about this brilliantly smart yet mentally unstable boy who is befriended by a girl. He has a break down, blah blah blah, gets stuck in a mental hospital, you know the drill. See? Not an uncommon plot, but i always fall for romantic love things like that. Shuddup, i can be a hopeless romantic if i want. :P The emotions could have been expressed stronger and I wasn't really impressed by the writing or anything. but its a sweet book. made me feel fuzzy inside.

there is a moth on the screen. i dont have the heart to kill it. oh, look, it flew away.

report cards come out this thursday. if my science teacher added my extra credit and dropped my lowest grade then i should be okay for that class.

okay, i have to stop listening to always ten feet tall before i over do it. *changes song* a favor house atlantic by coheed and cambria. excellent. *air guitar* BYE BYE BEAUTIFUL! DON'T BOTHER TO WRITE! DISTURBED ARE YOU WORDS AND THEY'RE CALLING ALL CARS! FACE STEP STEP DOWN, FACE STEP STEP DOWN. 
the whole song is worth the intro. i never quite grasp their lyrics, i dont know what the hell they're going on about....good stuff, though.

i agreed to taking violin lessons again. here's my plan:
One day, I will become an accomplished violinist. At a concert, the audience will be full of snotty jerks. Now, as I'm on stage, I'll be using an electric violin. Halfway through some fancy piece, I'LL BUST OUT IN LED ZEPPLIN! damn straight. Seriously. It'll happen. And then I'll flip them all off and play some Metallica or something. Good times. (shut up. i can dream, cant i?)

when i started this entry, it wasnt intended to be so long. i guess im more bored than i thought. oopsies."

"event","i used to think that it was me who was surrounded by a bunch of idiots in my school, but im starting to think thats it the other way around. i was always thinking that they were too stupid and too immature and needed to grow up, but maybe i should grow down instead. maybe its me. i think it is. am i expecting too much? of course i am, its the seventh grade, the kids are 12, 13. i cant expect to be able to have an in-depth discussion with any of them (aside from a few) because most of them cant say ""puberty"" without giggling. so how am i to talk about the rights of homosexuals with them?

a lot of my friends at school think they know me really well. phhht. they dont. if they did, they wouldnt understand. i dont mean that in an overly dramatic way (""NO ONE UNDERSTANDS ME! I'M SO MISUNDERSTOOD! *sob*"") i'm just saying it. they dont. they wouldnt. they'd go ""eww"" and turn up their pug little noses. things that i think are beautiful they think are perverted and weird. music that i think of as moving and wonderful they would think of as freaky and stupid. i need to make a world with people like me. the sane ones. or maybe its the insane ones. whatever.

i dont give my school enough credit. its not like im a total outcast or a loner. ive got friends, a nice amount. and they're really really cool. we're just so different, sometimes its a little hard to relate to them...

but. yeah. i guess i am expecting too much. grow down, erin, grow down. be twelve. be happy-go-lucky (as in all smiles, not bouncing off the walls) and be boy-crazed (over orlando bloom, not dead gay authors and david daskal, who looks like a ""dork"") wear designer, clean-cut clothes (as in aeropostale and abercrombie and fitch, not things you find at the thrift store and grungy clothes found at the bottom of the dirty laundry basket) and listen to ""good"" music (like jay-z and good charlotte, not saves the day and brand new) and just be like them and fit in a little better. dont be quiet, be loud and obnoxious. dont bury yourself in books, stand up and jump around like a crack head.

so im the abnormal one, and they're all perfectly sane. and i was wrong all along.
oops.
my bad."

"event","i haven't vented in my live journal for a while, and i don't want to bother anyone with my complaints so here it is.

this is the first summer i can remember in which i haven't wanted desperately to go back to school. in fact, i'm dreading it. abso-friggin dreading it.
i don't want to go back to those people, i don't like them, i don't like being near them, i don't like the fact that i'm stuck with them 180 days a year, around seven hours a day. thats not a lot but when you dislike them greatly its like an eternity.
i don't like their gullibility, although sometimes it's fun to see what they're dumb enough to believe. i don't like their stupidity. i don't like their superficiality and dislike of anyone who prefers music with actual meaning. i don't like them talking crud about me when i'm two feet away. and i just don't like them.
that isn't to say that i have no one at school who i can stand, because that would be a lie. i'm eternally grateful for brittney and alex, and mr. m as well. and then there's that really nice lunch lady who always has purple eye shadows on. and i don't mind bernard most of the time. and my old math teacher, ms. c. and then there are a few others, rudy, desmond, shacora, ebony.
but thats like, what a few people out of the three hundred something that attend my school? i don't mind having close to no friends, it doesn't bother me. and i don't really mind being the center of a lot of jokes, like i care what anyone says. but just, the people, their stupidity and fake kindness, there's only so much of it i can take.

it didn't hit me really hard until this summer. i don't know why. i've always been okay with the fact that most of the people at the crack house where i sit and 'learn' are idiots, i just don't know why it hit me so hard. i haven't been this down about anything in a while. but just the thought of going back to them gets me cheesed off. really bad.

and i'm starting to stress over everything. i was spazzing out today because i couldn't find the scissors. the thought of washing clothes for the warped tour (two days, august third) ticks me off. dad has the tv loud and its really getting to me for some reason. i don't even like going into my room because it's dirty, and usually i don't care that much. i keep trying to enjoy my last few days out, but the thought of all those snot heads gets me weird again. i was about to rip something up because i was working on a poem, a fairly good one, might i add, and the computer froze. for some reason, it didn't auto save and i lost it, and my memory is to bad for me to remember all but a few bits of it. i've deleted my poetry from UE, and i might do the same on poetictimes. i'm getting paranoid about someone stealing my poems. i don't know why, there's so much better poetry to steal than mine, why me? but i just am, i don't know. like i said, i'm starting to stress over everything.

i just really, really don't want to go back to school. and this was longer than i meant for it to be when i started, but i thank you for listening to it. although no one really reads my live journal so who am i talking to? its annoying to pour out your emotions and no one seem to bother with them.

the only thing i know to do is to try and enjoy the last few days of happiness and sanity. but that really isn't working for me right now.

God Bless
and thanks again for listening"

"event","My singing group, Chicago Chorale, is having its Fall/Winter concert early this year to coincide with All-Saint's Day.  I would describe this concert as small, but mighty, in contrast to the St. Matthew Passion, which I would describe as Awesome and Bach.  

The concerts are Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon.

Friede auf Erden is a particularly important piece because it represents the transition from Romantic music to Modern music, and is challenging mechanically and philosophically.  Schoenberg wrote the piece before The Great War as a choir piece, but the premiere had to be cancelled because the piece was too difficult for the choir.  It was subsequently adapted to have an orchestral accompaniment.  Then, after serving as an ambulance driver during World War I, he demounced the prospect of peace espoused by the work, fully sure that the world was too fallen to achieve it."

"event","From Wednesday night to Sunday morning I was home with my mother watching the spectacle of hummingbirds preparing for seasonal migration to warmer weather.  For the past couple of years my mom has set out feeders to attract them, but I had never been around to watch them in their pre-migratory frenzy.  I'm amused by how talkative they are, and also how territorial they are.  Even though there are roughly 10 feeders each filled with a volume of sugar water greater in volume than an individual hummingbird, hummingbirds will chase others away from one that they've staked out.  

Anyways, that's not the point of this post.  My mom suggested I pack my bicycle along, and even with both wheels removed, it wouldn't fit in the trunk.  So, Wednesday evening, I whipped out my bicycle themed multitool and was able to use it to wrench off the hex bolts holding the handlebars in place, even despite a distinct lack of leverage.  With that accomplished, the whole bike fit into the trunk of the Lumina such that the trunk would easily close.  Of course, the next day when I put the bike back together, I discover that one of the spokes broke (after futzing with the brakes and alignment for about 10 minutes).  So, I have to break it down again and drive it over to the bicycle store on the other side of the river.  It's a simple repair for a well-equipped bike store (such as this), but it was still going to take until the next day in the afternoon.  So, altogether I took the bike apart about 8 times for what ended up being one bicycle ride into town (20 miles round trip through the countryside).  Of course, getting the wheel fixed and peddling up hills (which requires constant shifting) drew into sharp relief just how screwed up the bike's real derailleur is which is another thing I have to get fixed sometime today.  Hopefully the local shop is speedier.  The ride in the country was still fun and informative, since I found that bicycling 10 miles into town was about as taxing as bicycling the 6 miles to downtown along the bike path, which says a lot about the amount and constancy of the wind on the lake front."

"event","I recently received the generous donation of a new (to me) computer that's sig more powerful than the machine donated to me a few years ago by the equally generous <lj user=""kaynorr"">.  Along with the machine came a new keyboard.  At first I thought that it would be donated to my mother who will receive my old machine as soon as I can get it working with a new brain, but when I tried using the new machine with my old keyboard, it responded poorly.  It wouldn't register letters that I typed (particularly annoying with character protected passwords).  I was a little paranoid that my typing skills had degenerated to Eloi levels, but then after getting back from my hometown tonight, it started being more overt in its War on Text and turned the caps lock on without my even hitting said button.  I thought that the keyboard port might be bad, and so I went to get the new keyboard on the assumption that it was a USB keyboard (being the way things are treading), but it relies on the same overdetermined port as my previous keyboard. So I plugged it in, not seeing the harm in trying, and sure enough I was able to type out a letter without any of the previous niggling hassles.  So, the minor annoyance of this mystery is eclipsed by the greater relief that I'm not losing brain or motor function.   The prior keyboard was a generic, bare-bones GE keyboard, so I'm really at a loss for why it would choose to cause trouble with Compaq hardware.

I don't know if I'm looking for an answer; this was mostly just a productive way for me to thoroughly test the function of the new keyboard.  However, I wouldn't be offended by people proffering answers in the response area."

"event","January 27th is my birthday, and in honor of the miraculous feat that occured on that day (which has not since been repeated), I'll be hosting my traditional birthday fete on the preceeding day of Saturday, January 26th.&nbsp; Consider this a formal invitation if you can read this, and if you do not have my address or phone number, presumably you can acquire that through some channel; otherwise, you should reconsider the legitimacy of your attendance...

Where: My house in Hyde Park
When: Saturday, January 26th 5pm-post midnight
What: Activities will consist of me frying things, including onion rings, chicken, mushrooms, and whatever people bring over.&nbsp; (Note: For people that want to throw down and bring something weird to fry, you should let me know ahead of time, because even the common french fry requires preparation before being given the Nebuchadnezzar treatment.&nbsp; So, if something needs to be frozen, or wrapped in wonton wrapper, or coated with pancake batter ahead of time, I can help you help me help you.&nbsp; Also, I'm not deep-frying bacon, because as the most perfect food, it can deep fry itself in a cast iron pan).&nbsp; Also, there will be cake.

What (should you bring): Yourselves, beer (if you desire such things with fried food), and any other celebratory beverage.&nbsp; I have a pretty diverse bar selection, but that can change over the course of the night.&nbsp; Also, no cake.&nbsp; There will already be cake; in fact, I'm eating some right now.&nbsp; So moist and delicious.&nbsp; Pies or confections are fine.&nbsp; But don't fret over bringing anything but yourselves.&nbsp; Wii will be played, fun will be had.

"event","So, I've decided that getting a land line in Chicago is foolishness, since the only person attached to the number is me, and so I must go through the dreaded search for a mobile phone plan.  This phone is to be my primary phone, but being a mobile phone, it would be nice if I could enjoy the benefits of being able to call anyone, anywhere, anytime (between 9pm-7am and on weekends).  So, after some data sifting, I've approached a philosophical crossroads: do I want a phone that will only be reliable on the digital networks near Chicago, or do I want to make sure it will work when I'm in the wilds of the Illinois/Iowa boarder (zip code 61270).  T-Mobile seems great for the first instance, while Verizon seems better in the latter.  

I don't really feel the need for a camera on my phone, but don't want some cheap-ass Nokia drug-dealer phone.  
I would like to be able to call to anywhere in the country without long distance fees.
I don't see why I should have to pay for the phone itself, or at least no more than 25$, since so many dealers seem to want to give me money for signing one of their horrible contracts.


So, if anyone has any suggestions for me, I'm putting out a call for suggestions."

"event","Last week, I think it was on the weekend, the following was part of my sequence of dreams:

<i>I was in a hotel, a very long hotel with many rooms per floor.  The color scheme was  mostly white.  I was probably staying with someone, though it was non-specified.  I remembered having come out of the shower, and I think I was wearing swim trunks, or maybe had just put them on.  The most important detail was that I had left the towel I had used to dry off on the floor.  Anyway, from the point I could remember, I was in my room (though I don't know if I was wearing the swim trunks, or even what I was wearing exactly), and walked to my room's bathroom.  When I got there, the towel wasn't on the floor, which made me realize I must have showered in the public shower facilities further down the hall.  It was important I get that towel before someone else took it.  The hotel was very wide, which meant taking the subway/trolley that ran through that floor (remember, the hotel was very wide).  On the track, I realized eventually that I was going the wrong way, or that I had already passed the shower facility where my towel was.  Anyway, the end of the line was the lobby/shopping area for that floor (imagine New Water Tower place, on the floor with the food court).  Sitting at one of the tables, in a white suit and a straw hat/fedora, was The Devil (in human form, but recognized by me).  Somehow, I knew he was waiting for me, or maybe we had an appointment (the kind you're waiting your whole life for).  He had the contract all drawn up, and all I needed to do was supply my name, address, social security, and of course, what type of rapid movement ability I wanted.  Evidently, he had determined my heart's desire to be the ability to move great distance of my own will, and I only had to pick among flying, teleportation, etc.  In exchange, of course, I had to give up my soul.  Now, I remembered that I was atheist in real life in my dream, but I was still reluctant.  I wanted more out of the deal, because I realized that whatever power I picked would end up getting me killed much sooner.  I remembered asking for something like invincibility or immortality, but evidently, The Devil didn't reckon my soul to be worth more than one super power.  I remembered feeling as though The Devil's powers were actually very limited, but also feeling as though this were a trick to make me settle on just one super power.  The Devil made as though this were a limited time offer, so I felt it better to just walk away than make an impulse buy.  

The only other thing I remember in the dream is looking out a window onto a building that was both ole 20B and the building that's being built outside <lj user=""kaynorr"">'s building.  It was sunny, and maybe I was seeing my past self when I lived in 20B.</i>"

Though, viewers reading this would realize the obs. was on this past Sunday, nonetheless it didn't stop some of the best parts from occuring yesterday, including a meal and (another) cheesecake cooked by <i>kagari-chan</i>.

"event","So, it turns out that the ritual to temper the weapons/characters in <lj user=""kaynorr"">'s game was a recapitulation of the Grail Quest.  The pentultimate event before the fight our game ended on was a large antechamber containing the bodies of all the god-annoited warriors that had lived in the previous age of the world.  In the center, two hermits stood over a crystal bowl with dark red fluid, and asked three questions of all who approached.  

'Whose blood is this? (referring to the fluid in the bowl)'
'Can you accept the truth, whatever it may be?'
And, 'What is that truth (being some destructive secret the character was carrying with him)?'

So, the characters have to give confession to the hermits before they (their weapons) can be baptised in blood.  All of this quest is to erase the taint put into the weapons by their creator, my characters previous incarnation.  He, of course, represents the Satanic force attempting to pervert the ritual and draw away seekers of the chalice.  In his final incarnation, he appears as an entity dwelling in a tree in whose branches the original forms of the weapons are tangled, like shining apples.  All the while, we are harried by <lj user=""jovianconsensus"">'s alter ego, the black knight dressed in the armor of the dead and is the 2-time killer of the lord of the castle the ritual is taking place in (the inflicter of the unhealing wound).  

The way to pass the end of the trials is revealed by the religious zealot/fool, <a href=""http://sharkninja.diaryland.com/""><i>SharkNinja</i></a>, which makes him the group's <i>Parsifal</i>.  He even finally got the power to heal by touch this session.  My character gets the <i>Lady of the Lake</i>, with her arm being grafted to my own.  I'm looking to <lj user=""voxel""> to get the unhealable wound in the game.  The symbolimetrics seem to indicate that the succession falls to him.

Oh, and did I mention that the whole goal of the game (after the army is pushed back) is to heal the blight on the land with a <i>magical stone</i>."

"event","Pleroma Online refers to the game about the game and the game that is within (the former will be italicized from now on).  <i>Pleroma Online</i> is the child of <i>Serial Experiments Lain</i>, cyberpunk, and various accounts of gnostic dualism that I've run across in history and fiction.  However, the catalyst... the seed, if you will, that crystallized the sundry into a form with function is a few reactionary rants against the facile offerings of such shows as <i>.hack</i> which promise to tell the story of online gamers blurring the boundaries between what is 'real' and what is 'not real' but end up being about how friendship blah, blah, blah...

Fiction/Fantasy/Sci-Fi takes the familiar and frames it with the unfamiliar.  You can relate to the protagonist no matter how hairy things get or how many laws of physics get broken over the knee of some sort of soul-sucking squid-faced bat giant.  <i>.hack</i> fails because it tries to do it the other way around: the unfamiliar, polite online gamers in a game where you don't actually do anything, is framed by the familiar, me giving a damn.  But, I digress.  If the online game, Pleroma Online, and its players were to be represented, it would have to be in a game system in a modern setting where obsessed people acting according to a sub-cultural belief system derive real power that is separate from temporal power.  

<lj user=""princeofcairo""> loves 'GURPS', I love 'Unknown Armies'.  I love it even more after reading 'To Go', though, the price tag might keep me from picking it up right away, lacking much crunchy bits that would allow me to justify the expense even without intending to run the scenerio, but that's a different entry.  

Anyway, the whole premise of gnosticism at its core is that the physical world is a prison created by a blind, mad god: the Demiurge.  There is another world, a world of immateria, which is good, in contrast to the inherent corruption of the physical world.  The pleroma is the extent to which one, the other, or both gods' powers extend.  Thus the name of the game and setting.  However, if I ever market this, I'm going to borrow an idea from the writers of UA, where there's a high road/low road/middle road answer to everything, both to keep the players who have doubtless read the books more times than the GM, and to allow the GM to customize things to keep the tone of an ongoing campaign.  There's three possibilities to the true nature of Pleroma Online: that it's an attempt of the higher power to teach the players a higher spiritual truth, that it's a tool of the demiurge to wrest temporal power away from secular athorities, or that it's merely a game that has gained mythic energy because of all the obsessed energy that has been directed at it.  Then, there's also the possibility that it started as one that is slowly becoming the other.  I've always felt that if the players were uncertain as to the nature of the 'ultimate power', they will be more rational in the approach their characters give it.  

So, what this grandiose idea translates to in the short term for those nearest and dearest to my heart is a one shot I formulated lying awake in the dark for 12 hours total over Christmas break.  <lj user=""kaynorr"">'s character in this scenerio, Hiro Protagonist (name to be decided later, but at least you have a fairly accurate picture) was one of the core creators for Pleroma Online.  He was responsible for the highly realistic fighting algorithms in the game, and he himself is a badass with a katana.  Sadly, neither a masters in CS nor a black belt kendo translate to good interpersonal skills.  Strung out on the game, and run afoul of a defense firm whose killer app he stole, he had no choice but to turn to the Occult Underground, or, at least, they had no choice but to turn to him for the only weak link in the circle of deacons of the game.  Of course, with his administrative access to the game long expired after 3 years away, he'll have to go about finding the McGuffin for his employers the hard way, which in this case, means finding a digitized copy of a porno tape(?) that has ended up as a hot commodity in the game and securing the server it ends up landing up in.  Fortunately, his mysterious employer has a veritable army of wackos and nut jobs to call upon and send to assist.  I've come up with characters corresponding to <lj user=""kaynorr"">, <lj user=""jovianconsensus"">, <lj user=""voxel"">, <lj user=""fengshui"">, and <lj user=""schlafmanco"">, which is intended to act as a option for the last two for when they're in town since I know they don't get to game as much as they'd  like.  But, I can run it anytime, since <lj user=""kaynorr""> is the only critical component.  Also, <lj user=""heathey""> is welcome to bring the return of Faith Black, if she is so inclined."

"event","Well, over break I had ample opportunity to read more than half of P.K. Dick's <i>Valis</i>, although it's really not something that one wants to just sit down and devour in one sitting.  It's far too depressing for that.  Maybe the ending will be the pot of gold for Horselover Fat that is the source of the pink laser.  And maybe he really is just insane.  <lj user=""princeofcairo"">, the giver of this wonder, drew a connection between the pink laser and the 'red pill', and maybe the fact that this is the first book in a trilogy provides the contextual understanding that if that if this is the first 1/6 of the whole story, I understand why the protagonist still hasn't found the White Rabbit, despite his best efforts.  Though, I still haven't been given enough within the story itself (metacontext of the giver's inscription not withstanding) to take the leap of faith that the character is receiving messages from both his past incarnation and his future omniscient self.  I guess that's a good safe-guard considering my future vocation.  

Anyway, this holiday, I was stuck in the black iron cage.  Even with the illusionary freedom of a vehicle at my disposal, the ability to get there means very little when 'there' doesn't exist.  My father, who I spent most of the time with, works 12 hour shifts, which means, early to bed early to rise.  My 9-year-old sister is, well, 9, which means early to bed, late to rise.  So, lights out at 9, which gives me 3 hours of laying on an increasingly uncomfortable couch (6 nights in a row, and the charm diminishes) awake, forced to task my mind in an attempt to incite weariness of the soporific variety.  

What better time to give consideration to Pleroma Online.

We were sitting around the table after the cake had been served, and someone referred to their mother, my aunt, Nadine by her nickname: Dee.  And my cousins, her two oldest children, asked why we called her 'Dee' sometimes.  So I gave the only obvious possible answer:
'See, back when she was younger, your Mom was a Powerpuff Girl, and that was her codename: she was Dee, the purple Powerpuff.'
'Wait,' they say, 'There isn't a purple Powerpuff.'
I respond w/o skipping a beat: 'Yeah, after she saved Chicago from the evil robot-monkeys back in '87, she retired, and they retired her colors in honor of her service.'

I don't see it as lying.  I see it as testing their long-term memory retention by telling them absurd facts that won't be reinforced by environment.  Then, every time I see them, I'll test their recall.  So, it's more of a longitudinal study across age-groups that controls for both environment and hereditary  and dietary factors.

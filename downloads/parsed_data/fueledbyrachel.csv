"event","So I have officially graduated from high school. I'll never see everyone in my class all together again. I'll never have high school work to do again. I'm finishedd. It's weird but happy. Our graudation ceremony was less than an hour long and it just felt weird. Like I felt like I was in a dream or something (not good or bad, just weird). Of course one of the speakers brought up Field Day again and we were all like WTF basically. She probably tried to top Jen's speech but that's basically impossible. It was so weird seeing all my teachers and stuff for the last time. I'm probably going to miss some of my teachers more than some of my classmates. I was really sad at graduation just because I really feel like my youth is down the drain. I am aware that I am a drama queen, but like high school is over. I have four more years to do whatever and then that's basically it. I'm subject to doing the same thing every single day for the rest of my life with no long breaks or anything, until I die, with nothing to look forward to. Sometimes I hate having such an existential view on things, but it's really an excellent coping mechanism when things go wrong. Not that anything has been going particularly wrong, so now it's just kind of depressing. I'm such an emo kid sometimes..
 This past week was senior week. I seriously don't even know where to begin. Like I have no idea. I felt like I was at the beach for literally a month cause I saw so many different people and was always doing something or going somewhere. It was a lot of fun but by the end I was getting kinda burned out cause I felt like I was there for so long. We got evicted which was lovely. Honestly when it happened, I could not stop laughing, partly because I was in shock that it had such good timing and that it didn't happen sooner, and partly because I was slightly intoxicated. The only thing that sucks is now we don't get the security deposit back, but whatever. It makes for a good story. And drama llama is going to be a new saying when things get intense (haha <3). I'm not gonna even bother trying to summarize the week much more than that. One day I'll learn to put my fucking phone away when I have alcohol in me though.. and that will be a glorious day. 
 So now it's summer.. for real this time, not ""hey have two weeks off and then come back and graduate"". It's really hitting me that everything I do is for the last time. Like I'll probably never have a full fall, winter, or spring in Maryland again. I feel like everything is just changing. I'll probably hang out with more Mercy people this summer than I did this whole school year and i'll be done being a loner but we'll see. I pretty much isolated myself except from a select few people this year cause I just couldn't deal with things and people but whatevv. Two months basically and then I'm gonee. It's gonna be really weird like the first time I come home. I feel like a lot is going to be different. I'm so excited for fall though. I'm really excited for orientation though just cause it'll be preparation for the school year which i'm excited about. I just can't wait to be out of Maryland really. I haven't found my niche here and I want to be away from home. I'm kind of scared for the academic portion because I legit need to get like straight A's or reevaluate what I've always wanted to do with my life. No pressure or anything. 
 Whatever. OH.. something I'm completely infuriated and depressed about: I leave for one freaking week, and I come back to the mall and Gloria Jeans is gone. Seriously, WHAT THE FUCK. I literally go there almost EVERY time I work, and now it's gone! Fuck starbucks, gloria jeans was where it was at. And now it's gone.. forever. I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. UGH. That just shows how much they're changing the mall, and when I come home the first time from college, it's gonna be crazy different. It'll be really nice but I don't ride change well sometimes. It depends. But anywayy, I'm gonna go find something to do. Probably not, but I can pretend."

"event","Of course I'm getting into one of my reflective little moods where I can't decide whether I'm content or discontent or what. I need to stop thinking so much.. seriously. It just never stopss. And you would think it would be about high school ending but it's probably everything but that. We have five days left of classes left which is five too many, and then exams. Ms. McGinty is a stupid whore and is making Noel and I take the regular exam, even though we took the AP. The only not that bad thing about it is that I have it the same day I have Bio, so she's not really taking a day off away from me that I would have had otherwise. But i'm still a little angry. Oh well though, there's nothing I can do. It's her form of vengance since she's mad that we took it. I can't tell how I did on it. There was a decent amount of stuff on it that I didn't know but when I took practice tests, I got everything that I did know right. But then again I never do as well on the real thing as I do on practice tests. French was ehhh. Literally French is one of the hardest AP's you can take.. I didn't feel that badly about it, like I thought a 3 wasn't that crazy of a thought until I got to the speaking ha. I couldn't concentrate of what I was saying at all cause I could hear Sarah talking too. I would have done much better if I just had silence but oh well. Neither of them affect my grade and if I didn't do well on them it really doesn't matter. 
Anyway, of course i'm really excited for classes to end and to be done with school because I'm so done with school, obviously. I'm so excited to just lay around and be worthless. I have a ridiculous list of books I want to read and then a few other tasks I want to do. And i'm so excited for orientation and just to be at VT. Words in no way can express how excited I am for fall. There are two things bothering me about it but I'll have to get over both of them, and everything else is exciting so I guess that overpowers the two things. 
And I wish some of my teachers would stop trying to go full speed with 5 days left. I'm sorry to break it to you, but you are in now way going to be able to teach us 18 chapters with 2 or 3 days of classes left. 
Oh and I think that Borders has become my favorite place ever. I can be in the worst mood every and I just go to Borders and I feel so much better. Whether i'm stressed out, just discontent about other things.. I don't know why. 
I think part of my discontentment comes from just like being here. There are like five people that I actually enjoy hanging out with, there's rarely anything to do, I feel like I have next to nothing in common with other people, and ugh I don't know. I need college now. And I think it's safe to say that once college ends, I'm not coming back to Maryland too ha. 
And now I think I may attempt homework since I have to work at 3. I've literally been at the mall like everyday for at least the past week or two. It's pathetic ha. Not all of those times are for working but still. Oh well.. I actually don't mind working a lot these days since school is worthless.. not to mention I need money for various things. Okay I'm done rambling now."

"event","I can't believe it's Sunday already, and I have to endure yet ANOTHER week of school. It needs to end already! I feel like there are some people that are getting either sad or nervous about high school ending.. but I'm neither.. at all. I don't know if I should feel bad about that or not ha.  Oh wellll. We got report cards Friday.. I'm really happy cause I'll be exempt for Lit and Sociology! aka, I'll only have to take one exam during senior exam week! (Biology, of course). For futures we'll just have a book report in our journal, and then for Stats and French I'm taking the AP's. So I won't have to deal with much during that week! Except before then I will, since I'm attempting to teach myself a few statistics chapters, and a few aspects of French are a little rough right now.. but I'll work on it. 
I'm excitedd for next weekend cause i'm going to VT. My parents will probably be a littlee annoying but I guess I'll deal. I have a lot of questions/concerns though because since they like to ruin my life (I've pretty much vented about this to anyone that will listen... multiple times) and not let me double major in what I want to, I have to choose. Ughghdfghf. Oh well I guess everything will be fine in the end haha.
Anyway, I'm really excited to get little to no sleep this week since that's been what happens every school week. Ugh.. And I've been doing a great job procrastinating today.. I went tanning, to Michaels, and to the mall. None of which were productive, at all but it's okay. Tomorrow is a half day which I am THRILLED about.. Then I have to work tomorrow night but that's the only time I work this week. I very content with that cause it'll give me a little bit of a break... I can't think of anything else so I'm gonna stop writing this and attempt to start homework! Ugh good luck with that.."

"event","So we're on spring break finally! woo! I have a lot to do though and very little time. I can't wait until summer when there aren't as many time constraints for everything. I guess I'll deal. I haven't really done much in the first two days. Today we had exercise practice and I was pretty impressed because everyone almost everyone actually showed up and we have one song done. Then I had to work.. and I got paid today, and my direct deposit kicked in already! So I don't have to wait until like Wednesday to have my money which is exciting. 
Oh and yesterday my VT packet came! I was a little paranoid that they may have made a mistake on the computer but now i'm fully convinced. I put the sticker on the car already and I sent in the deposit bright and early this morning, ha. I'm so excited for college and a lot of the people I've met already seem really chill. I'm excited and nervous for all my friends that are waiting until April 1stt! Oh and Delaware refuses to send me my admission decision.. some people have heard from them and some haven't.. which is weird. I mean I don't care if I get in or not, and I'm kind of not expecting to get in, but i'm curious. And Clemson was like uh yo we don't have your transcripts even thought I for sure sent them.. Oh well I don't even care. It'd be nice to know but it really doesn't matter.
It's so weird that sunday is easter!? This spring break is so early it's weird. I'm not really a fan though.. I don't know actually. I can't really see it being too eventful but I'm content with that. I really don't know what else to write, I just feel like I haven't written in this thing in a while.. wow a whole week.. that's pretty bad if that feels like a while to me. Anyway, peace."

"event","So let me tell you about my day.
I'm innocently online, I randomly checked my mercy email out of boredom and of course there was nothing. Then like 20 minutes later (because if you know me, you know i'm an OCD email checker), I looked, once again out of boredom.
There was an email from Virginia Tech saying that the decisions have been made and I could check online now, and I would be recieving it in the mail april 1st. Uhh check online now?? As soon as I read that my heart started pounding and I started shaking. 
I had never been more afraid in my entire life..
Well, after my three hour freak out fest, I finally ended up checking on my labtop in the panera parking lot (don't ask), and of course, the page took forever to load.
Then I it said something about my major on the first page that was different from the normal log in, and I had to click my name to see my status. Everything looked exactly the same as before, and I scrolled down a bit and all I saw in blue writing was ""Congratulations, you have been offered admission...."" or something like that and was in complete disbelief. I have never been more happy in my life. I have had more anxiety, fear, stress, hope, and everything in between for the past 8 months, and now it has all ended. I'm still in disbelief, it feels so surreal, but i'm so excited now. I'm into my first choice school and I'm sooo happy. I'm so excited to tell my cousins, and for accepted students day at the beginning of April! Hopefully my mom will let me order some stuff from the online bookstore tomorrow...."

"event","The spring weather makes me more reflective than anything else in the world... for a lot of reasons that I don't feel like going through but I love it (usually). It reallyy makes me think of the end of the school year, and so does Field Day.
For some reason, I'm really content right now. There is one thing that I'm very discontent about but I can't control that, and time will fix that, but other than that one thing, I'm actually pretty happy with a lot of things. That's a huge accomplishment for me generally too. 
Today I opened, it's the first time in a while that I haven't close of worked later on a Sunday and I feel like I have the rest of the dayy and it's really nice! Daylight savings completely made me disoriented too. I thought it was 8:30 and my mom was like uhh don't you have to work at 10 and I was like yeah why and she was like it's almost 10! I had no clue daylight savings was even anywhere near now, it's usually in April! So I rushed around and got to work at 10, but BECCA WAS LATE TOO! (haha just kidding, it's okay!) but daylight savings screwed us both up and it was annoying. 
I have a ridiculous amount of work though. Not much due tomorrow, but a ton due Tuesday and I have to work tomorrow night so I really need to do it all tonight. 
Friday we went to Body Works 2 for a Bio field trip. It was really hard to grasp the concept that they were real bodies so I don't think it had as strong as an effect on me that it should have, but it was still good. Then we saw an IMAX movie and ate in the Inner Harbor. In the sense of missing classes though it was worthless because I just missed Free, and sociology.. I had the beginning of statistics (I'm really frustrated with that class right now), and we come back to have all of Bio! (as if we hadn't had enough Bio for the day), but we just watched a movie so it was all good. Then Friday night Veronica and I went to Grace's to see her dog! She's really cute.. We went to the Orient and just hung out and it was fun. Last night I had to work.. which I was really unhappy about but it really wasn't that bad so whatever. I got fourty-dollars stolen from my wallet though in the back. It was kind of my fault cause we have lockers and I didn't use it, but I've never had a problem before and I trust everyone that works there. I know for a fact it wasn't anyone that was working so someone must have went back there when we weren't looking cause it was so busy it would have been hard to notice. Ugh it sucks but oh well, there's nothing I can do about it.
Oh and I've been admitted in all four of my safety schools with scholarships to three so far. Now come the  harderish ones...
We shall seee. 
P.S. Field Day is actually going very well! Our class has FINALLY found it's unifying thread (the hatred for the class of '09, and a love for disney!) And we have a secret weapon.. 
Anyway, I'm going to go to Borders I think and try and get a hardcore amount of homework done since I have so much.. laterr"

"event","I actually did a lot this weekend for once in my life and it was a lot of fun (for the most part ha). This week of school went by pretty quickly except Friday felt like Thursday, and Thursday felt like Friday. But Friday night I went out with Grace, Veronica, and Emily to Tervor's friend's house and it actually wasn't sketchy or that awkward which was a nice switch. Then Saturday morning I went to my cousin's baby shower. The circumstances at which she's having the baby are really weird (it's hard to explain) but it was fun and the food was amazing. Of course I got completely HARRASSED about college and I didn't really tell any of them where I applied except for what they already knew. And i got all these speeches about a certain school I really want to go to and it made me even more nervous for April. Whatever though. It was good to see some of my cousins since it had been a while. Then I went to work which was fine and then afterwards I went to Natalie's boyfriend's house, but I'm not gonna go into that cause it kind of ended badly for some. Today I have to work at three and then I guessss I should do my homework too. For some reason, a lot of the other private schools have off tomorrow which is completely ridic and snow is kind of out of the questionn. Oh and we started field day stuff. I'm actually excited this year.. it's kinda cute how everyone's coming together so early and I think we migh actually have a chance at winning, or at least I really hope so cause I hatteee the juniors so much. But anyway, I guess I'm gonna take a nap or something now cause I haven't gotten to sleep in at all.."

Today actually wasn't that bad for a Monday and I didn't really get much work today. Hopefully the remainder of the week won't drag. I feel like I write the same things in this thing every day, but oh well.
This weekend was okay, nothing too eventful but fun. I just hung out with people and Sunday I went to Columbia mall (again ha) with Lindsay and Grace. Of course I bought like three shirts. Ugh I legit need to quit buying clothes. I have more clothes than anyone who wears a freaking uniform everyday should have!
Anyway, after the mall we decided to go stalk Veronica. She had been napping for quite some time, so on the way home we went to house to wake her up and it was pretty funny. Her house looked like a crime scene or something cause it was like pitch black and we just like went in her room in the dark and jumped on her to wake her up, and it was very amusing. 
So February is basically over, aka March is here. I'm so terrified for the upcoming month from the beginning to March to the beginning of April for those letters (thick and thin) to start rolling in. Terrified doesn't even begin to explain it.
I don't know if I like not knowing or knowing better. With not knowing, all the possibilties are still open, but there comes a point when the anxiety and stress of not knowing builds up and you just need to know. That's the point I'm at now I guess. 
This whole process just sucks.. Ugh, oh well. 
I actually don't have to work tonight which is weird since I've worked like the past million Mondays, but I'm probably gonna go broke cause I haven't worked as much as I have before but whatever I'll survive. Andd I don't know where else to go with this entry so I'm done now.. later"

Friday went by pretty slow at school but oh well. Then I didn't have to work so I went to the Calvert Hall/Loyola basketball game with Natalie and Jess. It was a pretty close game but Loyola ended up winning.. Then we just like drove around and went random places and then ended up going back to Natalie's and some other people came over. It was fun though.. Saturday I didn't really do much and then yesterday I went to Columbia mall with Grace and Veronica and then we went to the driving range with her dad and siblings. Let me tell you how good I was at that haha.. oh god.. I mean, it could have been a lot worse though, so whatever. I ended up spending the night at Grace's and we didn't really do much but it was fun. Today I need to really finish my Futures book before work and I'm kinda tired since Grace made me wake up at like 8 haha. I'll definitley be getting coffee before I go to work. School is going to suck but at least it's only a four day week!

Okay so we had no delay or anything today, but it wasn't that bad. First period we had a breast cancer assembly which was kind of pointless because they kept repeating themselves and it was stuff I've already known. Then the rest  of the day was not as painful as I thought it would be but tonight.. ehh.. 
Well I don't have much homework, but I kind of want to die. My motivation level shifts from day to day, and tonight it shifted way down. Hopefully next week it'll move back up but that's another one of my patterns.

I voted for Mike Huckabee, and even though there's a slim shot of him winning mathematically, I'm really glad he's been staying in the race. At first I was a little bit confused as to why he was staying in, but now I understand that he wants McCain to see the that people are voting for him because of the things he's ignoring. And I was so confused on the whole delegate situation and whatever but now I understand the system much better and how things happen. 
Anyywayy.. I'm so glad we didn't have school cause I never did any of my homework. Whatever.. 
Okay, so it's seccond semester senior year. Why should I care a lot? I wish I just couldn't care. Colleges will see those grades but only reconsider admission if I'm like failing most likely. But of course for some reason I can't bring myself to not caring ugh ha. I mean I've been getting lazier, and procrastinating more, but I still get everything done.. which is a good thing but I wish I could just not care.
Oh and tomorrow's Valentine's Day.. I don't really hate valentines day but i'm not one of those people who love it, i'm just indifferent about it. But it is my mom's birthday, aka I need to get her present/s tonight. 
Andd yesterday I went to the gym with Laura.. I literally probably haven't done physcial activity since about September, minus a short run here and there, and for some reason I'm actually not sore at all. Tonight I think we're going to Pilates!

I'm quite envious of public schools because they're off tomorrow. Ughh.. but at least we have off Monday.. but so do they.. LAME.
Okay so I need to vent about something.. what else is new. I really can't stand when people who don't have an opinion on something, or have no idea what their talking about, try to act like they care, or even have any clue what they're talking about. I mean I am very strongly opinionated, and have opposing and clashing views with a pretty good number of people on one thing or the other, but even though I completely disagree with a person, if I know that they do have feelings and background knowledge to support it, and more imporantly they care pretty strongly, it's fine, and although I may not show it sometimes, I do have respect for them that they feel strongly enough. It's just not the same way I look at it. Of course I will argue because I like thrive on it, and things would be no fun if everyone had the same opinion on everything. But it's when people who have no idea what they're talking about and aren't strongly opinionated one way or another try to jump in the ring. It drives me crazyyy because they have never cared, and all the sudden they do, but have no idea why they care, or what they even care about. Seriously, that kind of makes me want to die. 
Whatever, I mean I guess this is a society full of people who don't rationalize or make informed decisions. (Which is one thing I've learned in Futures, not that it takes a class by any means to figure that out). 
Anywayy.. I have free first tomorrow, thank god! and I'm getting up a little early to go vote haha.. Mike Huckabeee all the way. I am very aware that he has a pretty slim shot, but I don't think I'd be able to not vote for him just  because of how much I agree with him on things.

I got lunch with Sarah and we just like talked about life which was nice cause we haven't really hung out in a while. Then I went to the mall and spent a ridiculous amount of money, but it was mainly cause I got sperry's which took a dent out my money, and I feel kind of guilty, but I kind of don't because I really needed a new pair of shoes. Of course I spent money at Delia's.. I really need to cut back haha. Next time I get paid I gonna try and not spend more than like 30 dollars there. I'll do it in baby steps.. slowly try and not spend as much ha. But I mean it's not like I really have anything else to spend it on. I usually put a little more than half in my bank account, and there are a few things I still need to pay for like senior week but I don't know since there's no big ultimate thing that I'm trying to save up for I don't think I should feel that guilty. I could try and save up for a car if I wanted to but it's kind of pointless cause my parents will still probably say no so whatever.
I literally was at barnes and nobles for like two hours talking to Laura.. and then we got food and just watched the OC. 
Today I have to work at two.. until five, I'm not really sure why I have a three hour shift but oh well it'll got by fast then. And then I might go to Borders after. 
Oh and I got into another school. (Catholic University).. It's like a madd safety and it's probably my dead last choice, but it's nice to be accepted somewhere else.

Aw on Thursday night I went to a Loyola College basketball game with Jill and we ate in the student union and stuff and it made me realize how so very excited I am for college. Like I am beyond excited, and there's not much fear holding me back..
But also talking to Laura yesterday made me realize how terrified I am for April. Like you know as soon as you see the envelope which is the part that's gonna break (or I guess make so to speak) my heart. I'm soo scared.. 
Everyday at school I feel more and more weird... Part of it is annoyance because all people care about is getting wasted, otherwise they want to kill themselves, and basically I just feel like I don't have that much in common with a lot of people anymore. I just care about different things and think about different things. 
Whatever though, it'll end soon. Hey guess what! I get to vote on Tuesday! I'm so excited, even though my canidate hasn't been winning but it's okay. I want Huckabee but McCain would have been my second choice so whatever. And Huckabee may very well end up being his running mate. Another one of my philosophys is anyone but hilary. I HATE that woman. I could tolerate Obama for the next four years if I had to (even though half of our paychecks are gonna go to a socialist health care system and other things like that), but I'd MUCH rather have him than Hilary. People say she's such a strong woman and so qualified and I don't understand. Watching your husband cheat on your for 8 years does not make you qualified, and legit all she cares about is money and power. I mean I get that it's politics and most of the politcians are like that, but not to the extent she is. She's contradicted herself so many times too. For example, she always says how she wants a timetable to end the war and stuff and she's always been against it. Hey, you know she voted for the war in the first place, and also voted for more funding in the senate. Ughh I just hate her. Sorry for people that like her, but that was my little rant. 
Anywayy.. so last night I worked, it was a pretty entertaining/fun shift though.. and today I don't know what I'm doing yet but we'll see. I might actually try and read my book for futures since I don't think I've read a full book for school yet this year, not counting summer reading. I don't know.. I'm gonna go.. laterr"

"event","My body is so exhausted.. I feel like I never have any time to relax, and sleeping is out of the question these days. There are some people that can get like three hours of sleep and be ready to roll for the week, but I'm the type of person that needs a normal amount, otherwise I'm dead.. aka I've been dying lately. Ugh oh well, it's nice to get money though.. even though I always end up spending it at the same place it came from.. I have a huge wishlist right now though, it always builds. I need to get a neutral pair of shoes, like an in between of uggs and flip flops.. I need an iPod of some sort because apple is worthless, but of couse I like to throw more money in their faces, despite that, and there are a few other things. But at least working will help fund all the crap I want haha
So we got report cards friday.. I didn't do amazing, but not bad. Of course I did kind of awesome on my exams which helped my semester grades, which is ironic since I spent little to no time studying for them. I'm getting so burned out on school though. My motivation is nonexistent, and I've been trying to set little goals for myself so I can keep going, but it's kind of difficultt. A snow day would be much appreciated, but of course they come at worthless times. 
Another thing, I'm sick of dumb girls.. just in general.. but oh well I suppose I'll have to deal with it. I need a vacation! I mentioned going to Florida for spring break and my dad was all for it, but of course my mom hates going ANYWHERE and said she didn't know. Or if I get into the school I'm applying to in SC (which is possible, but not reallyy probable) I'll most likely end up going there to visit it. My parents never vacation though and it's lame..
I should probably go to bed but of course I won't.. I have a Lit test tomorrow that I haven't studied for, and I'm sure I won't study for it now but maybe in the morning?

"event","So second semester has started and the laziness is kicking up a notch. The only class that switched for me is Bioethics to Futures. I love Futures though, It's a very thought provoking class.
One thing that is has made me come up with a theory on the reason why I bascially have the next fifteen or so years of my life planned out. It's pretty logial...  Humans fear the unknown. That's just human nature. I think one of the main reasons why I plan so much for my long term future is because of fear and an attempt to shove the fear aside. I'll explain. There is no possible way of knowing what will happen in either the immediate or long term future, but a lot of people plan, and I think the reason for the excessive planning (that I myself am guilty of) is because we don't want to accept the fact that so many other things could happen that can't be determined. So instead of just going with things as they come, and accepting life like that, we push fear for the unknown aside, and attempt to make what's unknown, know. 
I mean I'm sure there are much simpler reasons why people try to plan ahead, esspecially more immediate things, but the more I think about it, the more logical that is to me when thinking about things on a larger sense.
I'm starting to realize that my mind gets really philosophical about a lot of things. Even some of the simplest things. I don't really know why I always feel the need to question and analyze everything that is thrown my way but oh well..
Anyway, on a lighter note.. I've been so tired. I've worked the past three nights so I'm kind of excited to not have to tonight. I'm not sure what I was thinking working at the main clothing store that I shop at though because everyday there is something new I want and it kinda sucks.. Maybe it'll teach me the concept of self-control... or I'll just go broke via clothing purchases. We'll see which one it ends up being...
Oh and of course I decided to apply to yet another school. I'm an idiot, but oh well.. I don't really have anything to lose except like 60 dollars so whatev.
At school we're starting to talk about the dreaded field day. I wish our class wasn't worthless and could win something. We're awesome every year at field events but it's the other day that doesn't work out as well. I guess we shall seee. But field day means spring, and spring then leads to summer which equals: graduation, senior weeks, the beach, reading on my own time, blasting OAR, and all sorts of other happy things!
Summer would be really nice right now..."

"event","It hasn't really hit me yet that's it's 2008. Whenever people say it, I still feel like it's far away. I didn't really make any legit resolutions but I never really thought of anything besides trying to enjoy what's left of the school year. But in my first couple of days of 2008, that has been very difficult. I should probably work on complaining and freaking out less; that would be good. Oh and do a major cut back on the drunk texting. We'll seee. So it's only Tuesday and this week is already feeling long. We have midterms next week. I didn't get any days off but oh well. I'm actually not thatt worried about them except it's my last chance to bring up my semester grades for colleges. Lately I had been feeling extremely confident about the whole college process but right now I'm at a stage where I don't feel confident at all and I'm getting worried. I go back and forth on these stages. I should probably just try not to think about it, but I mean why would I do that. Sometimes I wonder how people can put up with my analyticalness and what not. 
Today one of the teachers said something that I've been thinking about. ""The more angry and annoyed you are, the more anxious you are to graduate and for the year to be over"". Ha I guess that's pretty true but as much as I've been feeling like I can't get out soon enough, it's gonna be really sad to leave a few people. Like the small number of really close friends. I just don't want to grow apart from certain people but I know that's life. I know I'm getting way too philosophical about this way too early but I don't know, it's kinda sad. Of course my excitement kind of overpowers the sadness but it's still there. 
So before break, in french we had to write when we feel alone or like a 'stranger' ha. We just had to list but no one really did it but I was thinking about it and I think this school year I've felt more alone and like a 'stranger' than ever. I've just been finding it harder to relate to people, and the people that I can relate to kind of have someone else if that makes sense. I don't know, I guess that's one pretty big reason why I'm excited for like eight months from now.
I feel really bad for whoever reads this crap. But I guess it's their choice. ha
I don't really know what I'm doing this weekend yet but it's only Tuesday so yeah. I have to work saturday, and open which I've never done. It's gonna suck not being able to sleep but I'll live. And if I feel ambitious tonight, I might actually start studying for exams, just because I don't really have much other homework.
Oh! andd when I was in D.C. I lost my flash drive in the OAS building. Welll they found it! Which is kind of exciting cause I have some documents I still wanted on it and I was too lazy to go out and buy a new one. I hope they didnt read my stuff but I'm sure they did since in the email it said they looked at the resume to see who it belonged to ha. Whateverr. It's kind of funny how whenever I lose things, they DO turn up, it just takes a while.
Andd I don't really know what else to write so I suppose I'm done."

I'm done all my college stuff except for one little supplement that is incredibly easy, I just keep putting it off. I'll do it for sure this weekend though. My other eight schools are done though. I got a jobb finally too! Classes are okay but Ms. Urysaz drives me crazy because she always treats me like I'm stupid, even though I have a grade that is on the better side of the average grade in her class andd she overexaggerates everythingg. Whatever
Yeah so I've been thinking about existentialism like all the time lately. I seriously love it and I've been applying to a lot of things.
And of course, I'm reallyy excited for graduation. I'm starting to really realize how hypocritical Mercy really is and how it's like corrupt. The school is all like 'omgzz compassion, individuality, hospitality' but they constantly judge everyoneee, they don't let anyone be an individual at all, and they certainly don't treat everyone with compassion. They only recognize certain people and it's just all ridiculous. There are specific cases I'm thinking of but yeah I need to get out. They try to conform everyone and it drives me crazy.

For some reason I'm really happy and excited right now. I have no idea what I'm excited about but that show put me in a really good mood.

"event","I'm starting to get everything together, it's making me feel really excited. I have the school's applications that I'm for sure applying to at this point almost all done. I've determined that Virginia Tech is my first choice, and I'm beginning to find a few more saftey/good match schools and develop a finalized list. The only thing i'm stressed about at this point is my math sat score. My reading and writing are perfectly fine for my schools, but we'll see about math. Once that's over with i'm gonna be back to normal, and on top of everything again. Bio freaking sucks but I'll get used to it. Ms. Uryaz and Ms. Shroeder drive me crazy but I'll get used to them. It's basically just about adapting to their teaching style even though it sucks and I hate it. Oh well.. I feel like everything is starting to fall into place.
  On another note, I'm not really sure how much more of high school I can take. The school work and academic stuff is fine, but as always I'm annoyed with everyone and so over everything. I guess it's weird to a number of people that a first semester senior would be thinking/talking of/about college. Crazy concept, right? I'm sorry that I actually care about the course of my future unlike other people. I can't deal with being around people that don't care about anything. It drives me INSANE. It doesn't matter if you care about making sure every homeless person in Baltimore City has crack! As long as you care and are passionate about SOMETHING. That was a weird metaphor, but I'm just trying to make a point. I don't understand how people can just not care, esspecially about something as big as.. oh I don't know, the rest of your life.. but I guess people don't really see it like that. First of all, college is way more than academics, and second of all, the quality of the education at CCBC and Harvard are PROBABLY going to be SLIGHTLY different! Whatever, sucks for them. And I'm soo sick of people being dramatic and stupid over everything thrown their way. Is it really necessary to talk about anyone who may have some kind of difference than you? Like are you really that insecure with yourself that you have to talk about other people to make yourself feel better? Or make big deals over nothing? I'm not really sure I'll ever get it, and it continues to frustrate me. And if one more person says they're looking at TOWSON, VILLA JULIE, SALISBURY, *INSERT OTHER MARYLAND SCHOOL HERE* I'm going to shoot myself. I can legitimately understand people wanting to stay close to home, but EVERYONE? seriously. They aren't bad schools, but come on! People are so scared to go out of their comfort zones and they need to get over it or they're not gonna get anywhere. 
  I just can't stand being around a lot of people these days, and I want this year to end. But getting everything together is making me excited for it.
  Oh and we finally got our rings monday.. It was actually a kinda fun day..

"event","So I got home from school not too long ago.. Only a day and a half left of classes and then four exams and then I'm done. It feels like it's going to take foreverr. That awards assembly was today.. wow does that make your confidence shoot down. It was my first one since I usually leave for the beach on that day but it was soo long and boring.. Do they really have to announce EVERY scholarship that each senior gets? and I'm not just saying that because I'm a junior.. next year I'll feel the same way. And you hear the same 3-6 names about a hundred times. It seems like at Mercy you have to go way above and beyond in order to recieve recognition. They isolate all the ""honors"" kids and label them as the smart ones and those are the only students they care about.. I don't know it's really annoying.. Whateverrr.. So I'm leaving for ocean city tomorrow with&nbsp;Grace and Emily which I'm pretty happy about.. Hopefully next school week goes by fast.. Summer feels like it's so far away in a sense, and in another so close.. I just want it to come so I can no longer be stressed out! Alright well I'm gonna finish cause I don't feel like typing anymore.."

"event","Okay so I'm pretty sure everyone is sick of me being soo fucking emo lately but I need to write.. 
Alright so Friday was the seniors last day, meaning we are seniors soon.. 
As much as everyone is very excited about this, I'm pretty indifferent also... As much as I'm like ""ahh I'm so excited for college"" and stuff like that.. I don't know.. it's just weird to think about because this time next year I'm going to be starting to say goodbye to all my friends.. Like everyone is like uhh you know we still have another year and stuff but it's gonna go by relatively fast and then it's over.. and high school is like the core&nbsp;time of growth and stuff&nbsp;that you always hear adults talk about... And then once college is over we're in the real world with jobs..
Yes, I know that I am being ridiculous and overly emotional about this and whatever but it's making me feel soo nostalgic and discontent and I wish I didn't feel like this..&nbsp; 
I don't wanna grow uppp.. and I guess I'm just trying not to take things for granted 
This probably makes noo sense to anyone reading it but it does in my head kind of.. I just suck at explaining things.. always.. 
Anywayyy.. 
this weekend was interesting.. Friday was a little sketch but not really.. I always end up downtown even when I'm not trying to at allll.. it's really great.. Saturday I camped out with Delaney and Emily which was interesting haha.. Today I went to my uncle's and saw my cousion who I have not seen in like five years or something like that and then went to the mall for a little..&nbsp; 
and now I think I'm going to take a very MUCH needed shower and maybe ""do homework"" (aka lay in my bed and watch the OC) or something.. 
peace fools"

Saturday I took SATs (which weren't AS bad as I made it out to be but they weren't good or anything), then hung out with Delaney and went to the towson festival with her and Laura.. Then we went to Panera, Target, and Sports Authority.. ha and they didn't have ping pong balls..<br />Then later we went to pick up Veronica and it was a pretty interesting car ride haha.. Laura and I were pretty rebellious in certain ways ha.. Then we went back to Delaney's and I learned for like the second or third time that I am not good with screen doors and by not good I mean I don't see them.. except having&nbsp;a bowl of ravioli in your hands isn't the best combination with that trait..<br />Then Sunday I just chilled and went to the towson festival again with Sarah..&nbsp; Some people in towson are really freaking weird..&nbsp;<br />As for this weekend, I have no idea yet but I guess we'll see..<br />Wow this is really long so I think i'm going to end it now..<br /></p>"

I'm used to always having older people in the school and feeling like senior year is so far and it's almost here.. It's just so weird for me to grasp.. I should probably not be thinking about this now, and more when it is actually here, but I'm just being reflective and emotional.. life is just weird..<br />okay enough of that, anywayy.. I don't know what I'm doing this weekend yet but there better be something good cause I'm taking SAT's Saturday unless I kill myself before. I'm going to like fail them if that's even possible ha..

I get in these OVER-reflective moods where I start to question everything every couple of months and lately I've been getting it again. I'm getting really scared cause high school is almost over but part of me is like so ready for it to be done. I just go back and forth so much and I hate when I get in these modes cause I just start thinking about how absurd life is and it makes me like depressed. I'm just really scared about some things. I'm one of those people that always wonders 'What if...' about everything and it's so bad cause then I regret little things and start analyzing everything I say and do to the point that it becomes out of hand. Most people who know me know I get in these little retarded emo moods and it's just a phase I go to every couple of months. It's probably annoying but they make me so discontent about life and I don't know what to do with myself until they pass. Like it's good for me to be analytical sometimes but other times I wish I could just go with it..

I don't know if i'm doing anything tonight and tomorrow is up in the air but Saturday I'm visiting JMU during the day and then at night going to hamilton.. I feel like I haven't been there in a while even though it probably wasn't that long ago.. It'd be really cool if I recognized more than 10% of the people there though... oh welll..&nbsp;
So sunday I went to my aunt's house for easter.. It was kind of interesting.. my older cousins who are married with kids are pretty good influences on me, esspecially when they tell me to get drunk and party a lot over spring break and tell me the best places to do that ha.. Their kids are soo cute though..

Tomorrow night I have to work at mercy's dinner theatre and then&nbsp;I'm going to watch the play with a bunch of people.&nbsp;Then saturday I have no idea what I'm doing, but I have to devote like a lifetime this weekend to learning this chem chapter and doing my fucking lab report... wooo.. Oh and I might get a prom dress saturday finally ha. I might wanna get on that since prom is in less than a month and I'm pretty sure I'm one of the only people in my class that doesn't have a dress yet. Prom is OVERRATED! 
Whateverr 
Okay so this is really random but I need to vent.. Fucking O'Malley is allowing ILLEGAL immigrants to have IN-STATE college tuition. This is RIDICULOUS. Okay first of all, they should be happy enough that they are here and are actually going to college for out of state costs, when they're breaking our laws in the first place, but in-state tuition!? what the hell! and also, where is he planning to get this money from? I'd really like to know.. and I'd be really pissed off if I was from out of state and going to a MD college and an illegal immigrant&nbsp;was paying less than myself.. god what a fucking dumbass. 
Anywayyy, after contemplating my ring choice for hours and annoying everyone and anyone, I finally decided on white gold, in case anyone was wondering haha 
So this week&nbsp;I've been like losing my mind. I have noo idea why but I've had like 384388734 times more energy than normal and it's reallyy weird.. Maybe it's the weather? I have no idea.. Andd I'm getting so lazyy with school. I used to be on top of everything this year! Like I did my homework like 8 years before it was due, and now I don't even touch my bookbag when I come home unless it's like an emergency or really try. 
Oh and we got report cards yesterday..&nbsp;mine wasn't bad but it wasn't like amazing. I guess it was really good considering I haven't been trying as much as I should be but whatever. After we calculated our GPA's in junior seminar, I'm just like whatever cause there's no way I can bring it up significantly with what's left of the year. And I really didn't think freshman year or sophomore year like mattered. They were all like OMGZ DO WELL JUNIOR YEAR@#^ but noo let's throw in freshman and sophomore year! I did not try one bit freshman year so that sucks. Oh well, can't do anything now..&nbsp; 
Wow this is reallyyy long.. and random.. 
Alright I'm done, I gotta attempt to do homework.. or something 

oh p.s.!&nbsp; 
the news was on and just so ya know, marajuanna is not kosher, but crystal meth is, so don't smoke weed during passover.. but crystal meth is okay..

We lost to the freshman. And it wasn't just the fact that we lost to freshman, it was the fact that we lost to '09' bust a Rhyme'.. it's pretty pathetic, so hopefully we'll do well.. Anyywayyy.. course selection needs to die. French five is fucking up everythinggg.. I might not be able to take one of the electives I want and I'm gonna be pissed if I end up having to take random meaningless classes.

The people at the BC board of education are a bunch of dumbasses basically.. 
So anyway, I'm probably going to kill myself from boredom in like 5 minutes.. I can't take this.. 
I registered for the SAT's like 20 minutes ago and they asked me all these random ass questions that were really annoying. I'm soo scared to take the SAT's.. It's this stupid test, that doesn't judge your math or reading ability at all, it just judges your ability to master that test format, and it makes or breaks your entire life. It's so stupid.. Just because you do well or don't do well on them doesn't mean you'll do well or fail in college. They really need to get rid of those suckers.. Whatever, there's nothing I can do about it until the do get rid of them except prepare.. gayyy.. 
I want tomorrow to come.. I already know what I'm doing which is a first..&nbsp; 
I have soo much homework this weekend I'm going to shoot myself.. but at least I'm off Monday.. wooo thank goodnesss..

ah I've been so hungry today and I have no idea why!

I have to finish my whole research paper rough draft tonight which is gonna suckkk and I have random other shit to do.. but yesterday and today didn't feel that long, I guess cause I've had free last. 
Hm yeah so a lot of the classes in my school have been talking about the movie 'An Inconveniant Truth'&nbsp; and it's really bothering me. I find it kind of hard to take it seriously, because the whole point of the movie is for Al Gore to show how we should cut back on our energy use, yet there have been multiple studies showing that he uses 20 times more energy in his day to day life than the average household/people he's telling to cut back, soo I don't really get it. I mean the intentions behind it are good, but some things&nbsp;just don't make sense..&nbsp;whateverrrr
Okay if one more person discusses prom or their GPA, I'm going to go crazy.. Like it's really annoying.. esspecially when people are like ""omgzz my GPA is soo bad I have like a 3.9! ahhhh"" dude shut up! anddd I hate junior seminar, it just makes me wayy stressed out and competitive and I can't take it.&nbsp;

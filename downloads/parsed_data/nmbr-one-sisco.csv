You might have seen this place on TV. They have a seven foot champagne glass hot tub in the room and your very own heart shaped swimming pool. This resort is kid free!YAY! They have a night club too, but if you go, BYOB because their drinks are so weak, you could drink 5 and not even have a buzz.Not to mention the price.I have a picture of Jeremy in the champagne glass hot tub, but it's a see through glass,and I'm selfish when it comes to my man's goods! If you'd like to go on vacation there, it's worth it. They have all different kinds of rooms.OH! AND a round bed with a celestial ceiling!!</P>
<P>So I've dedicated my life to cleaning, packing and repairing. Our raised ranch just isn't big enough anymore so we're selling.It was fine when the kids were young, but now they are teens, my oldest, 15, is bigger than me!! I feel old. 32. Never thought I'd be this old. Life just flies by when you get older. I don't look forward to it. Misery seems to be the future. I know, I'm negative, but it just seems like one bad thing after another, my Mom had cancer for the third time, she just had a stem cell transplant and so far so good, but she suffered tremendously, while my Mom was in Yale, my father had a major heart attack. My grandmother is 89 years old and totally with it and in decent health. Sometimes I look at her and wonder how she still goes on after seeing her brother, sisters, husband and friends die, and my mother suffering.It would kill me to see my daughter go through what my mom did.</P>
<P>Anyhoo-back to my busy life........</P>"

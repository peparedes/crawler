Brian didn't go, but at least I didn't end up fighting like I thought I would. YAY! Kristin turned out to be toatally different, which was a good thing.  Hmm, Dani left be a nice little voicemail! It's cute, so I saved it. Hehe, luv ya girl! :o)

That's about it, it's FRICKEN hot, so I must go drown myself in freezing cold water at the pool. Whoo!

DAMNIT, I forgot to get money out of the thingy.. so I turn around and walk in through the out door. Gah. It's his fault, I tell you!! ;p

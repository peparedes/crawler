I'm paying rent, but I knew that I was going to be doing that if I didn't attend school. My parents and me are getting better so its not as bad as I think it is. Friendships and relationships are good, so I guess my life is good. It shows. Well I'm outie.

"event","Well my guy had to leave yesterday, he had to fly out to Cali to do stuff with his family. His dad had a massive hard attach, family is important so hes there. Although I wish I could be out there with him to be at his side but, I didn't have enough time anyways. I hope he's coping well, it sounds like it, but I think he's trying to be strong for his family. We've been seeing eachother for about a week and a half and it feels longer just the way we act together, and the way things are. We have a lot in common, I don't even know the half of it, but with as much as I do, its weird. I've never liked someone so much in my life, and I'm feeling a magnetic pull toward him, and I'm loving the feeling I'm getting. Well gotta go, I have to work in the morning and I have to wait for my babe to call me.

I'm the only seasonal person they've trained to do Guest Services, and the only Seasonal person doing everything else all regulars do. So I think they're going to ask me to stay which is hard b/c I love my other job, and my boss is dieing without me, and I already told him I was going to stay. But the sanitizer we use is causing my eye to get infected.But this isn't the point of writing in this journal entry. The purpose is to share a guy asked for my number. Oh my god, wow. Its been a while since a guy has asked for my number. I'm sorry its just weird having a guy ask for my number after so long of not wanting a guy to ask, but Hell I'm over the ex boyfriend, he prooved he's a dick and I don't need it.

"event","Hello to all. Well you know how I wrote I was eternially in debt, I'm now drowning in it. This is the story.
Monday: I had to be at work at 8am, so I do this. I had to call my vet and get an apointment for my dad to take the dog in. I called and they were booked for the next 3 weeks, so they suggested that we bring the dog to stay over night. I went home, go the dog and took him in. I went back to work and not even ten minutes of being back to work, my dad calls, ""The dog has bitten an employee, we have to pick him up"" (COULD THIS GET ANY WORSE!) On top of that we had animal control called on us because all vets have to report this. But that isn't that bad news, we're being charged b/c his rabie shots arent up to date and b/c my mom never registered him. So is this getting any better, I DON""T THINK SO!! I drop the dam dog back off at home, and I leave to go back to work. Half way there my check engine light comes on AGAIN!!! Could it be any worse, here it comes, I have to have $500 worth of work done to my car, when about a month and a half ago i had to have $500 worth of work on it. My parents are paying for it, let alone all the fine for the dog,and my brothers wedding.
Tuesday- my dad and I take the other dog to the vet to get updated on his shots, come to find out he has heart worm, so theres $400 worth for him, since he has it, we know the other one has it too. So theres another $400. 
See people, don't the holidays just BLOW!!
Let alone I have to do all this, I can't move out in January like I planned. I'm sad b/c I was looking forward to it, and now I feel like I'm letting down Debra's so Mike. (he was going to be my roomate.
This is me signing off.

"event","I had class tonight and I so did not want to go, but I've already missed two days, so I had to go half asleep, and blind in one eye. The doctor said it wasn't pink eye, but it may change into it. He said I may be allergic to my dogs. But how is that possible, I've had my dogs for eight years and I've had a cat my whole lif up until I've had dogs. And no I'm not getting rid of them. I'd rather get pocked in the ass every month than get rid of them.
       Then there is the whole money issue. I'm broke and Christmas is on its way and I've only boughten one gift, and I have like 3 more to go, that doesnt include my friends. Oh gees. I'm not going all out like i usually do. I usually buy all my friends gifts. Not this year. I'm only buying for those who mean something to me. Mike, hell, he's easy. A carton of smokes, so I don't have to hear him bitch about how he has no money for smokes or gas. Love you Mikey!! Deanna thats so simple, Gift certifactes to Subway, its her favorite resturaunt. April, so simple, oh gees, a gift certificate to Fairavila. she'll love that. Then there's Mr. Christopher. He's the issue, no idea HINT HINT!! (I know you read these) May be a great girl, I'll rap her up and exress mail her to his house. Or directly to his bed!! LOL! Love you Chris.

Then theres my friends, I don't see Mike all that much anymore b/c our schedules are opposite, the reflect eachothers, then theres Deanna I don't see her all that much and I know she needs me, and I hate that I can't be there for her. Then theres the other clan, Chris and April, they're my cheerleaders. They've been my support and my arms, it sucks though b/c Chris is leaving in less than a year for the Air Force, you lucky bastard, you get out of this hell hole of a town.

"event","I was totally reading old LJ entries and they amused me so much that I decided I ought to post. If for no other reason than that my future self should have material to look back on and be entertained by. Like- remember the wacky days of early 2005. Craaazy. 

I have to say that I particularly enjoyed my angsty entry about the pissr event and GENDERQUEERS. It was mega entertaining. I <3 my neurotic self. 

That being said, I think I hang with queer kids of my own age now. Which is totally novel. I kind of still hate the bulk of the population (queer and not, my age and not), but I have a core group of cool people. Mostly we talk about how we hate everyone. (I'm about 70% kidding). Also, the other thing I do now which is GREAT is listen to country music. It makes food taste better and bee stings hurt less. For serious. 

Also, in case anyone was wondering, there is some really excellent kite-watching to be done at the marina near my house. Cause it's all hell of windy there, so people fly the most ginormous kites you ever did see. Some of which are octopus shaped."

"event","riight. so anyhow, last night, there was this thing, and the genderqueers and the ALL LOOK ALIKE and the studded belts and the newsies hats and ps i love newsies but then there were Drag Kings and all That entails with the stripping and the boygirl etc etc etc on to infinity and fairy butch who is a funny entity and all the social and the People!! and the cian and me being curmudgeons and doesn't that sound like bludgeon (to death with a spoon) and this kid i knew in middle/high school named lucy would always talk about bludgeoning people with spoons. also the pope. 

but anyhow, the ungarbled moral of the story is that i went to this Thing last night and broke my streak of hermitude. it was, like, a PISSR event (cause for real- that's the acronym. and it's even about bathrooms. it's like trannies+ who want genderneutral bathrooms and stands for people in search of safe restrooms. or something) with the required parade of queer/trans/drag/etc performers. and Dean Spade and Dylan Vade (just so you know, i capitalize their names not cause they're names, but to emphasize that they are A Thing. i mean, not like A Thing in that they do each other- at least not to my knowledge. A Thing in that they're a phenomenon or something) were both there. and i made cian mad by saying that they were the same person because they're both tranny lawyers who started their own trans law project-y things and both have ""D"" first names and last names that end in ""ade"". i left out the fact that i think their names should both be shortened to ""d'ade"" to complete their merging into one person. i think that would get me cut off from baked goods forever. and i did concede that dylan is taller, and dean has more hair and also that dylan is more faggy whereas dean is more femmy. and one is the east coast d'ade, and one is the west coast d'ade. 

speaking of merging into one person, anne said the other day that it was a shame that austin and i weren't lesbians cause if we were we could just merge into one person and not be breaking the housing codes even more than we already are whenif he moves in. i was entertained. '

but the main point of the thing last night was not torturing cian with discussion of the d'ades, but in fact, the Genderqueers. with a capital G capital QUEER. riight. it's very disorienting for a boy who spends all day at work with Straight People and goes home to a house where all the queers are 10-20 years older than me (except the babies) to be suddenly plunged into this room where 90% of the breathing entities were 20-something genderqueers. it was all ohmygodohmygodohmygod hyperventilate. like i shoulda been all ""my People!"" but i was just like ""oh my god! they all look the same!! eeeeeeeeeek!"" it was a big ball of something. and not only do they all look alike, i look like all of them. like seriously, probably 40% of those attending had my belt, 65% had my boots, and 10% were wearing the same hat. and everyone and their mom has a black hoodie. like, seriously, there were probably only, like, three people out of 150 that i didn't have at least one clothing item in common with. okay, maybe not really, but you get my point. and i mean, i theoretically know that a lot of what i wear is like the Standard 20Something Genderqueer Uniform, but no one i see on a day to day basis (with the exception of austin) dresses like me At All. so i was all woah. 

and it was also totally weird cause i'm not used to seeing large groups of people who are potentially in my dating universe. cause most of the work people are straight, and those who aren't probably aren't the kind of queers i would date (i mean, plus the only ones who are of the demographic that i theoretically might someday date are, like, Youth. and i'm like Adult Staff. but even they aren't really in my dating universe, if it weren't for the age even). and like, my house people are my house people, and older and such. and like, then there's austin. so i'm used to the only person who i theoretically would date that i see on a day to day basis being the person that i actually am dating. which makes the whole monogomy bit quite a bit easier. but then being in a room with 200 million people who are in my general dating universe it was like the staring game and i was all ""*there's* a hottie, and *there's* a hottie, and *there's* a hottie"" and it was way too much. but fun to stare and made me want to make out with them all. 

which also brings me to the central conflict. here are the sides: ***side 1*** they're hot. and, like, like me. and like, why did i leave school if not to find something like this. and i remember what it was like to have felt like i would kill for that. y'know? ***side 2*** i feel like large numbers of those people in their actual selves and personalities drive me stark raving mad. and like, large crowds like that and scenesters both make me really nervous. ***side 1*** i feel like, some kind of obligation to participate in like, genderqueer society. and that there's this Cultural Phenomenon that i want to like, witness or watch or participate in. or that that's like part of my cultural (heritage is probably the wrong word) that i should be in touch with. or that i should be like all ""my People!"" or like i owe it to my-past-self-at-swat to take advantage of it. and also that maybe for a while i needed to be a hermit cause it was all Too Much and my house is really safe and this little isolate on it's own away from peoplepeopledramacommunityrahrahpoliticsartdramadramatoomuch.but maybe that now i'm ready to emerge from my cocoon and be a person for a while. cause i've had my time, to like, get grounded. 

and like maybe i do need to spend some time being 20-something. i kinda thought that i just wanted to skip between 12 and 30, but maybe there's value (that i'm missing)in being where i am. and i should, like, live what i need to live. [insert sound of music reference here]

but also, back to the whole dilemma of that lots of those people irritate the heck out of me. and on a contradictory note, i'm kinda afraid that i'm going to want to do all of them and that will fuck shit up with austin. but then i got home and he was there and beatiful and my favorite even though he's grumpy. and the thing also being that if i were to like, go there with the social and the genderqueer scene i don't think he would come. but maybe that's fine and just about developing Separate Social Spheres. or something. 

so much more to write but this entry is already 5 million long. kisses and love to anyone who actually reads it all."

"event","hey cathy- that's one thing i left out. i say fancy. a lot. geez- now that i sit down to write i can't think of anything. i went to two birthday parties last week. one was for squid and that was cool. there were queers and streamers and sparkly ribbons. one was for my dad. that was not cool. there was family and polite lying small talk and plaster smiles. less cool.

right now i am very much enjoying the growing up song from the care bears movie where they were babies. yeah. i have a cd that is nothing but that and i listen to it on repeat when i'm going to bed sometimes. austin finds that reeaal special.

speaking of whom, he's a rockstar. so much with the rock. i called one of my board members a rockstar the other day and he corrected me and said rapstar instead. perhaps i should be aware of the musical biases in my slang terms of approval. naughty jacob.

speaking of biases. me and cian have a solstice party on saturday. even though it's not really solstice till... monday? right.

work is slightly less crazy. it's a game called think of it as a Learning Experience. which it is. and Good on My Resume. which is a slightly less admirable reason to do a thing, but true. bell hooks has convinced me, however, to work on finding pleasantness in what i'm doing now. and, like, being there, rather than constantly living elsewhere and elsewhen and thinking of where i will go with my resume dressed in this job. and i, like, owe it to the youth in my program. cause they are largely rad.

in honor of the 20 word year in review mayfly website skelly sent, here is my 2003: 

allergies suck. sick. dating cute red haired boy. i <3 babies and housemates. family. country dreams. work stress. learning.

"event","I just looked at the livejournal main page and there are such things. appalling if you ask me. so my day today was rather fantabulous. and that is not a word i use lightly. well- i guess it could be, it just seemed like the fun thing to say at the moment. 

i got to talk to s**** (i'm playing the game of not saying anyone's names in here- it's a fun game. like gin rummy) and my secret twin today. it was a nice break in the middle of my work day since i was at their office-place for another meeting today. and s says that he cuts hair and could even cut my hair!! yay for me. i've been in such a state of hair uncertainty once i lost faith in  sasha (game over) to ever give me a haircut that wasn't too short. my inclination is to trust s with haircutting responsibilities, even though i doubt he could ever live up to the haircutting standard set by maria. she's my eternal hairdresser forever. 

and then me and s and my secret twin decided we should have a movie and hot tub party in a couple of weekends. it will be an exciting extension of our tonga room adventure (yeah- it included floating bands. intense)"

"event","i'm not sure how i feel about this new blue lj color scheme. weird weird. things are going okay in the world of me. i had this nervous nervous meeting yesterday defending my health-type benifits from those that would have them drastically reduced. i wrote this weird nervous email while waiting for the meeting to happen cause it happened later than it was supposed to and i had nothing to do that morning and wouldn't have even come into work if it hadn't been for that meeting. but i figured it wouldn't be productive for my case if i was goofing off and looking like a Bad Employee, so i pretended to be writing an Important Business Email, the text of which follows:

-----Let's pretend that we're writing an email. Just for busy work's sake. Yeah. Busy
busy bee like people with the anti-cat protesters outside the window on their
soso loud talking things that come up to the eighth floor and through my window.
You'd think from the average strength of apple stems that people with names
starting with the letters D-L would get married more than most, but it seems
unlikely. Holy lord aren't you glad that we use numerals and not written out
names of numbers when doing math? like, think about trying to do addition like
this:

 	two-hundred thirty two
	sixty four
 	one hundred and eight
       +nine hundred and eighty four
  -----------------------------------------------

oh my lord what a nightmare. do you think you'd get used to it? i suppose, but
don't you think that if people were brought up on that way of doing things, and
then were shown our way, that they might like it better even though it was
unfamiliar? maybe i'm just being ethnocentric or numeralcentric or something... i really want to eat my lunch but the nervous nervous meeting is *supposed* to happen soon. really now. i wouldn't even be in this early today if it weren't for this meeting that never seems to happen. i'm gonna be hell of anxious / irritated if it doesn't actually happen. -----

but it did happen. and i think i won a preliminary tentative victory. i have to have another meeting to determine the exact dimensions of it though... so things are still somewhat reversable. we'll see. i'm mostly feeling much better about the boss-woman though. she's a reasonable sort, or has the potential to be anyhow."

"event","so this friend of mine i haven't spoken to since high school got married and sent me a picture about it. wacky times. we were pretty good buddies my junior year before she went off to college. i kinda want to be creeped out by the whole thing, except her wedding picture is hell of pretty and i just want to stare at it. i can't help it- i have a thing for a pretty girls in wedding dresses. and she has a fabulous bouquet- it's not all mono colored like most bride bouquets, it has lots of colorful flowers many of which might actually be daliahs. which is cool. daliahs are my mom's favorite kind of flower, just for all of you who might not know.

i kinda want to send her some sort of congratulations card or some shit. which would have to be under my old name. sigh sigh. i would kinda like to like, be in contact with her and write emails sometimes and stuff though. which would entail explaining the name and gender change or whatever. but, i suppose she delt pretty well with me when i was a wacky bisexual polyamourous 11th grader- so maybe she can deal with the trans thing."

"event","okay. so the xacub has been busy. with the work and the fastfast doing of things and staying late and the boyfriend all the time in the night time. eek. okay. things need to slow down. 

work is going well, i think. i think i'll, like, learn a lot or something. that being said, being in this busybusy work environment makes me think that i'd like to eventually has a job that has calm as an integral feature. and not, like, staying late or what have you. and i don't know that being a librarian would really be like that, but in my head it would be. jacob the librarian. ponder ponder. sort of tangentially related- is it really true that someday i'll be a grown up? wacky. 

dude- austin has been stressing me out recently. he's been really stressed out and we've had lots of arguments that go like this: him getting upset about something, me not being supportive in the way he wants me to be, him saying i don't care about his feelings and me saying he's overly sensitive. blech. and i think both of us are probably part right, but the sorting out of that sort of thing just makes me want to hyperventilate and run away. 

i mean, all that being said- he's still a good boy. i mean, i think part of the problem at hand is that he's better at being emotionally supportive of me that i am of him. or something. which, as relationship problems go, is not that bad a one to have. 

i just get a little nervous about the idea of being with someone who gets stressed out really easily. which he totally does. like, small things will go wrong and he gets all jittery and freaked out about it. and i'm like OH MY GOD! GO TO THE STORE AND PURCHASE SOME COPING SKILLS PLEASE!!! only i don't say that out loud. only in my head. cause i do like to retain some semblance of being a tactful person."

"event","i feel like lots of things have happened. bullet points might be in order.

The Road Trip 
*i went on a road trip to oregon with austin and aidan
*they bicker a lot- which is stressful. also cause there's this subtext of it being about me in some ways.
*mostly it was okay though. 
*family was stressful, but ended up okay
*my 14 year old cousin is hell of cool. she just found out i was a boy the day before she saw me, and already was catching herself and being all ""e*, i mean jacob""
*misha lectured me and said i thought about gender too much and i would drive myself crazy and i should just let go and just be me
*or something
*this irritated me cause #1 she only sees me when i'm home and stressed out, so she's not making this analysis from a good set of data and #2 whatever who is she to tell me how to deal with stuff
*i got to see some nice oregon forest trees
*that made me really happy
*also i like that austin fell in love with oregon forests and likes them as much as me
*we got sorta lost in the woods at night and it was a little scary but turned out okay
*oh my fucking lord the central valley is hot to drive though in the middle of the day in july
*d'aidan's car has no air conditioning
*i made it back with no permanent damage to my relationships with my mother, brother, cousin, grandmother, boyfriend or aidan
*given the circumstances, i think that's an accomplishment

The Allergies
*i got blood drawn on wednesday. 
*i have two doctor's appointments on the 31st
*i'm running low on prednisone, which means i'll be miserable again soon
*this is stressful as my allergies are going to get worse right when my job gets more demanding
*i want them to figure out what's wrong with me
*i want it to be a food allergy or some such thing
*not lupus. or hepatitis b. or leukemia. 
*those things aren't probably really very likely, but i do worry a bit.
*with my new job stuff i get better health insurance, so maybe i can get better doctors soon or something. 
*or at least not have to wait 6 weeks for an appointment
*the public health system in san francisco is crazy
*i hate sf general

The Job
*dude- i get to coordinate this cool program
*and get a big raise
*and benifits
*i feel really bad though, cause elsewhere in the agency, there are all these huge budget cuts
*my friends are like, having to work more hours for less pay
*and i get more money
*this is unfair, but it's money from different funding sources, so there's nothing to be done
*i'm really excited about my new job though
*and a little apprehensive that maybe i won't do a good enough job

The Boyfriend
*he's amazing
*i like him
*we're going to have babies and cathy will be their aunt

Miscellaneous
*i got a new day planner
*i love it more than life itself
*i have a secret long lost twin
*her name is megan and she looks like a girl me
*it's kinda creepy but she's cool"

"event","right. since you don't probably get that reference, it's cause d'aidan calls me xacub for xadrian+jacob. just so's you know. work was kinda crazy today. i was bored and didn't do much and was tired and then there was a training which was fine but it meant that i didn't do much database stuff myself but since i'm suddenly supervising two different database intern-types database stuff got done anyhow. and the database hates us anyhow when too many people are working on it at the same time, so i feel vaguely justified that i spent lots of time piddling around with other stuff. like, 40 records got added today, and i only did 10 of them. maybe that's okay. it's just weird cause it feels like my job is transitioning from actually doing database work to supervising the people doing the database work. which is kinda okay, but it makes me feel like i'm not doing real work. also makes me feel squishy (and not in a nice way) about being, like, Management instead of a Worker. like, whatever, this is a non profit, so it's kinda different, but still or something. non profits pretend labor politics are irrelevant but really they aren't. shrug shrug. 

but this big ass grant at my work went through. and that's cool. it means, unless things change in the contract negotiations, that i'm going to be working full time at this job. i mean, i'll be the database manager part time and project coordinator for this other do-hicky the other half of the time. so yeah. it'll me money-ically good. 

dude- i got to watch radical babies last night with the childcare collective. it was mad fun. i was super scared a while back about doing childcare in spaces that weren't explicitly queer, but i think i'm learning to navigate it. not that it's perfect, i opted not to correct the kids who were calling me she last night, but i'm working on it.

dude! so. it's looking highly possible that me and d'aidan and austin (the boooyfriend) and possibly one other character will be taking a fabulous roadtrip to oregon in july! yay. cause we'd be going the weekend of this art/music festival that happens in the town where i grew up which is like, a Big Summer Event, and pretty cool in its own right and there would be music and we could see MISHA!!!!!! and traipse around corvallis. which i think is worthwhile. it's like, part of my Process for finding some way to integrate My Past and Where I Came From with my current self/life. which is a major theme right now. i could write a book.

i feel like the question of the month is: am i femme? (all of y'all should comment and cast your votes) cause recently i've been feeling the whole working the femme boy thing. and me and d'aidan were talking about doing femme boy workshops for homo conferences. and yeah. also in the context of dating the austin, like he's all butch and shit (oooh... fetishize masculinity.... hottimes) and it's like in some ways we have this butch-femme dynamic going on but not in a way that i totally recognize. cause, like, i feel like most of my impressions of butch-femme are formed by observations out of dykeness, and i'm not sure how it looks if you're not a dyke. and i mean, i think, if you're not a dyke, you don't usually name it butch-femme, even if the dynamic is similar. which makes me think it's funny (both in an entertaining and in a weird way) that i feel like this is the first time in my life i'm in a relationship that resembles butch-femme in any sort of explicitly named way, and it's happening when i'm not a dyke anymore. and i just feel weird about claiming that dynamic cause i have this super ambivilant relationship to dykeness right now and how i fit with it. which also makes me feel weird about claiming the term femme- cause i feel like that word (in it's claimed-as-an-identity form, as opposed to just an adjective) is soso rooted in dyke communities. and like, how all these trans boys claim the term femme cause so many of them came from dyke space, but hardly any nontrans boys do. funny funny. 

i guess i just feel like i'm a lot around transboys etc types who are really _not_ identifying with dyke communities anymore. who are more interested in biofag culture. and there's almost this distain for the genre of transboys+ who are still all dyke entwined. and even while i recognize that as something that i don't particularly want to reproduce, it kinda seeps into my brain.

i also feel all twitchy about labeling our relationship butch-femme cause it feels like cousins to being the girl in a straight relationship. which is something that SO did not work for me. but, like, we were talking about it, and he said something along the lines of ""dude- i've been with femme girls, and it feels *nothing* like this"" (also- he probably didn't say dude. but i did) like- that he feels like it's a butch-femme dynamic, but of a totally different sort than the kind that involves girl femmes. which made me feel better. and vaguely cutting edge. like- inventing new meanings for butch-femme or something. i dunno. and then i worry about what it means to dilute the original meanings of words that come from a community that i no longer belong to. fuss fuss. i worry a lot.

it annoys me, though, that being in this relationship would in any way be a catalyzing factor in me claiming femmeness. it makes me want to go on a femme-is-not-dependant-on-butch-to-be-called-into-existance rant. and defending femmeness in that way makes me feel more femme. but in a good way. 

also- at this meeting i facilitated last night there was a fabulously femme-ish person who's pronouns i don't know and i was super excited and was like, oh my god, can we paint our nails together???"

"event","woo okay. i had a father's day dinner with my dad and grandma and step mom on sunday. what the fuck ever. i was really proud of my father-managing skills though cause i managed to keep the whole experience really short and without any actual substance. and i kinda think my grandma saw me kissing austin when she picked me up cause he was just leaving cause we were fucking until, like, 2 minutes before she got there. scandal scandal. but she didn't say anything about me kissing him. i wonder what my family would make of me kissing a boy. i mean, he's pretty visibly a boy and all. cause my guess is that the best way that they can make sense of my gender cues is to just assume i'm a dyke. which would leave them confused if i was kissing a boy. i dunno- maybe they're all sophisticated and are all like, bisexuality... yeah... but i kinda feel like i doubt it. 

also- i'm going to the waterslide park-place tomorrow. eek. with anne and ari and squid and joey and sasha. fun but swimming swimming eek. but joey will be there and if he can do it i can do it. (dude's like, in a similar body-gender situation to me- only with facial hair and a bigger chest. so) and sasha is sort of theoretically moral support- even though he's all had his surgery and blah blah blah envy. hopefully it'll be good times though."

"event","also- i went and bought cinnamon gum this morning cause i've decided i have too much nervous energy and need some way to vent it that allows me to simultaneously do my work in some capacity. it's kinda nice and burns my tongue. the guy at the convenience store gave me my change in nickles and dimes cause he was out of quarters. i don't usually count the change people give me, but this was a large pile of small coins, so i felt vaguely obligated or like i should count it. but then when i counted and it was a dime short i didn't actually feel like saying anything, so i just left and wondered why i went to the trouble of counting. 

i got the sugar kind of gum not the sugarless cause i think artificial sweetners are gross and i'm too much of a hippy and they give cancer to lab rats anyhow, but chewing it vaguely makes me think of how my mom would only let us chew sugarless gum when we were little and the phrase ""bathing your teeth in sugar"" even though i'm not totally sure she ever said it. 

i think, however, that this gum thing is helping with my nervous energy. snapping gum. oh yes."

"event","gargle. we'll get to the subject in a minute. right now i'm eating these black eyed peas that i thought were going to be a pile of tasteless gross mush, but are in actuality quite tasty. my boss, however, was not convinced by my testimony and gave me a highly skeptical look for eating mushy brown hippy food. cause last night was anne's night to cook, and she often does these hippy bean things. sometimes's they're kinda eh, but this is good. and when she does hippy bean things, there's pretty much alwasys cornbread, which is a bucket of excitement.

speaking of buckets of excitement, i talked to skelly yesterday and she said that she's thinking of coming for a big visit of fabulousness if she doesn't get to be a camp counselor for the gabies. which would be fun times. 

gargle. my mom's visiting next week. i think i need to have A Talk with her about My Gender Stuff. cause, like, i have no fucking clue where she's at about it. and i really want to get my name legally changed soonish. please please no more with the icky id. sigh. i'm in a freaky mood right now cathy, so forgive my rambling. but i feel like even though i need to do what i need to do for my survival and sanity (name changes most immidiately, probly/hopefully chest surgery within 1-2 years maybe maybe i don't know aaahhhh) i also should at least give her the opportunity to get more on board about shit. and at this point she's just not talking. so. i don't know. hyperventilate that.

grrr. to the subject line. i'm just all flipped out cause i hate feeling like dating austin now is triggering all this bs i have about relationships left over from mike ""the arsonist"" lindsey. what the fuck ever. that relationship will have been over for four years in september. so for arrggghh's sake it pisses me off that i still have all these Issues left over from this bullshit little straight boy i dated when i was 16 who wanted to burn down a goddamn middle school. like, for real, i listened to ani this morning and was angsty about it (yes you can laugh at this. it is soo mockworthy). dilate to be specific. and was all. goddamn you you fucked up boy who made me be the girl die die die etc. whatever. it's annoying cause even though i was angsty to the max about him for a while, i feel like it hasn't really gotten to me in a while. so now i'm all pissed that the shit is still there and kinda freaked by it. 

and i guess i just worry that in order to Process That Shit i'll need to return in someway to being a girl in my head cause that's what i was when it happened. like, i have to revisit where i was in order to wade through the nonsense that ensued. and maybe that if i spend too much time in straight-girl head space rearranging emotional crap that i'll get lost and won't be able to find my way back to boy. and then i'm like-okay- how fucked up is it to be this terrified of being a (straight) girl. like girls are rad to the max. i <3 <3 girls. but i'm not one. and i'm feeling paranoid that i'll get stuck as one or something. i dunno."

"event","so last night was the best phone night in quite some time. cause, out of nowhere, my friend amy from high school called while i was eating my chocolate vanilla swirl, chocolate dipped ice cream cone (it was way tasty) right as the second to last episode of buffy was coming on. since i am have not yet totally been initiated into the cult of buffy, i went off to my room to talk with my dear old friend amy c. it was really nice, cause i often have complexes that i don't have any friends from longer ago than two years. and that is no good. i don't like feeling like my life before college was this weird mysterious fog out of which i emerged, never to communicate with that world again. which is sometimes how i feel, particularly given the rampant heterosexuality that runs amok in my high school friends like some new and awful std. okay- not really, but that was a fun sentance to write. and they are mostly straight. like, the kind of straight girls that make out with other straight girls sometimes, but mostly only when their boyfriends are watching. whatever. and amy is still convinced that katie is a secret lesbian, even though she's apparently picked out her colors for marrying some boy she's got.

which brings me to the main source of conversation with amy. how freaky all of our friends who never left town are. like, seriously, when you have a group of friends in high school, and some leave town after and some don't, the ones who leave can never deal with the ones who stayed. they're hopelessly the same. they hang out with the same people (with the exception of their new boyfriends), they do the same things, they act the same way. so aimes and i talked about how the old gang is psycho weird. it was mostly nice. and she was pretty rad about gender shit- all asking how shit was going with my mom and being appropriately sympathetic. i'm really thinking that this is a high school friendship that could be salvaged. and that makes me happy.

and then! after i watched the second half of the second to last episode of buffy- skelly called!!! yay for life! it was fun and she gave me swat gossip, which i always like. and all of a sudden talking about swat gossip just reminded me of alex cause he used to pass it along to me too, and i miss him. but yeah. talking to skelly was rad. she cracks me up about sex and her scandalous plans. <3 <3 and all that."

"event","the thing i like the best about my bed is how it feels really enclosed like this little nest up in the sky. only it's in my room. but by the skylight. but seriously, it's enclosed on three sides by walls, and the ceiling is right above my head, and seeing as how i currently don't have a rail to prevent me from falling out of bed, the last few nights i've put large piles of things on the not-wall side to calm my paranoia of falling 76 inches to my death/maiming. and i like collecting everything that i'll ever need up there. like, i have a stereo, alarm clock, lamp, books, and last night i even had my water bottle up there. like i can collect my life up in my little skynest and never come out. only the extention cord only really has space for two things to be plugged in at a time. well- it really has three slots, but one of them won't let the prongs on the plug go all the way in. and i feel like that is a fire hazard. 

in other news, i'm going to the sacramento tomorrow to some protest against cutting education funding. cause anne and squid (and presumably ari) are going, and education is better than prisons, so i thought i'd tag along. fun times for the jacob."

"event","i'm eating tasty food right now but i also bought a bike yesterday. cause my old one got stolen. sigh sigh. so i had to buy a bike and helmet and lock. and i'm buying lumber tomorrow for my loft bed building plans. so much with the spending of money. but i get money back from taxes at some point, so i suppose that makes it okay. i shouldn't end up spending more than the amount i'm getting back. 

annoying anecdote relating to the purchase of the aforementioned bicycle:
so i was talking with the bike salesman, and he was nice and all and i was going to take some bikes out for a test ride and he was all okay just leave your id with me. and right when i'm getting it for him he's all by the way what's your name, and since i'm giving him my id and don't want him to think it's fake and i'm going to run away with the bike i'm all uhhh... it's e*. ugh. so from there on out he takes every possible opportunity to say my not-name... how did you like that bike, e*? can i get anything else for you e*? how would you like to pay for that e*? ew ew triple ew. and on top of that, once he ""figures out"" that i'm a ""girl,"" he starts treating me like i'm totally dumb. like, you know the thing you enter your atm pin into when you're paying with a debit card? he's all, now you have to look at that and make sure that's the right amount, and proceeds to repeat the amount that he just said and i had remembered perfectly well. argh!!! #1 don't treat girls like that #2 i'm not a girl and that is not my name. ugh to the max. the sad thing is he was really nice other than that (before he thought i was a girl?), so i really wanted to like the guy. i dislike it when people seem out to ruin the good impression you want to have of them.

so apparently the one other person who sort of knew about this journal doesn't really, so it's essentially an ongoing personal letter to you, cathy. don't you feel special? i think i kind of prefer it that way for now cause when i thought d'aidan knew about it i was all paranoid and didn't want to write bitchy things about people he knows. you, however, are thousands of miles away, and do not know any of the people i slander. woohoo! plus you are my eternal roommate forever and i probably censor myself less in front of you than pretty much anyone. let the good lj times roll. (i had to take a break before writing that to lick the parmesean cheese off of the lid of my tupperware).

also- i recently made pretty much my first post on strap-on where people's responses (or lack thereof) didn't make me feel dumb. and people, like, agreed with me or whatever. woohoo! maybe it will inspire me to stop being a maniacal lurker and actually post there once in a while. then again, maybe not."

"event","also- it might be of interest to note that this house down the street from me got burned up and the cops think it's arson. and apparently the guy in the house is someone who often calls the cops on the drug dealers on the corner so everyone thinks they did it. shrug shrug. the cop who came to our house asking if we'd seen anything was such an evil racist motherfucker. like, he was talking about how some neighbors wanted to install more lights on that corner, and he said ""those people are like cockroaches, they scatter in the light"" and i just gaped at him from the other side of the room, appalled. ew ew. i felt much better though that anne and sugee were like, um yeah- that guy was a raving asshole and anne was being all upset that the only way people can think of to solve the problem is to drive the people out of their house and the neighborhood. ew."

"event","so after a less than ideal retreat, i get home and am reminded of how i live in the coolest place in the world. ari turned two on saturday, and his party was sunday (i missed both- so sad- but i picked him a yellow flower on my walk home) so the house was decked out in streamers and there were all these people around from the aftermath of the party. and i walk in and sasha's sprawled on the couch and irwin kisses near my cheek in this adorable faggy vaguely french way that he always does, and i get several hugs from marilyn who is everyone's pflag mom and ari's all jojo! jojo! and cian's in the kitchen and there's soup and polenta and salad and bread. and even though i don't particularly trust oren farther than i can throw him it's a very amiable kind of mistrust and i bitch to him about people who like to pretend they're youth when they're not and he acts smug about how he has better boundaries than everyone and their mom.

and i got to watch a movie with sasha and cian that's quite good called real women have curves. and even though i thought the movie was less critical of some things than i would have been, it was still pretty rockin and there was this part where all the women strip down to their underwear to compare cellulite in this funny empowering way and it rocked. besides, the point wasn't entirely the movie, it was also in a large way the institution of watching movies with sasha and sitting next to a cynical cian in this really familiar and comforting way. yeah- i really think that i should stop interacting with people outside of my house unit, cause hanging out with my housemates+ usually puts me in a totally good mood and hanging out with other people usually makes me cranky. sigh sigh. i keep wondering if i should spend more time attempting to fight my reclusive impulses..."

"event","okay. i've failed in my life long non-lj goals. sigh sigh. you must be extra special careful not to let anyone know of my fall from grace. you pinky swore and all. and don't add me to your friends list- otherwise people will follow the link to me. i am a paranoid child, yes i am. anyhow- i should get to work now- but to make myself feel better about failing to maintain an lj-less life, i will close by stating some goals i have achieved in my life.

-i swore that i would never get my own french fries in sharples, that i would only mooch off of other people's fries, and i did.

-i swore i would never eat a sharples donut, and i never did

-i identified multiple trees last weekend using my spiffy sierra nevada tree identification book

okay- so writing those things in here probably means that if any of my other friends did find this journal they would immediately know it was me, but. sigh. i will have to let go of that small piece of paranoia."

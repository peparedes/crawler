"event","Well, New Years was fun.  Can you feel the sarcasm?  We didnt really do anything special once again.  It was pretty much the same as last year and the year before that to be honest.

However today was valentines day which is always hetic for me being the Prince Yuki Fanclub President.  I had to be very careful that the girls werent disrespectful of Yuki.  All of them kept ridding his locker of other girls chocolate.  How childish.  Of course I might have thrown out a parcel or two, or three, or maybe even four.  But Im allowed seeing as I am the president after all."

"event","I'm so bored.  Only a couple of days to new years but really theres nothing to celebrate.  My family isnt a large one, its just mother and me so I doubt well have a big celebration.  I miss school so thank goodness that it starts again soon.

to tell you the truth, I am rather . . . . lonely/  This must sound preposterous but I . . dont really have any real friends.  Im sure that Minami, Mai and the others only hang around with me for some sort of satisfaction, to fit in.  That and they find Yuki cute.  But only cute.  They dont love Yuki.  Not like I do.  Not real love.  No one could ever love him like I do."

"event","Oh how I detest that Tohru Honda.  Always by the Prince's side, it is as if she has super glued herself to him.  I know that he must hate it, yet, he always smiles at her.  If he smiled at me the way that he smiles at her just once, I would be truly happy."

"event","I'm sat at school typing this.  Its strickly ""work only"" in here so no doubt I shall get thrown off in a minute but I see this as work.  Yuki is straight across from me and I . . think he might have smiled at me.  I hope so.  Each smile is like a precious emerald that I treasure forever.

The weekly Prince Yuki Fanclub meeting will be held today after school, our main objective will be to sabatage the firls who are on the council next year (I finally found the list) although . . . I am starting to wonder what the point is as Yuki should be happy, even if its with someone who . . . isnt me.  But thats just talk for quitters!!  I cant give up!!"

I have always meant to get one of these things.  Also my beloved Yuki has one so I think it would be an ideal opportunity for me to get closer to him.  Ah my sweet sweet Yuki!!  

My name is Motoko Minogawa and I am president of the ""Prince Yuki Fanclub"".  Our aim is to protect honour and serve the Prince.  I will go (and have gone) to any lengths to achieve this!!  And I mean any lengths.

Today at school was wonderful as I got to see my beloved for a whole minute.  I like watching Yuki when hes alone, I think that a person looks their most beautiful when they are unaware that they are being observed, that way they look completely natural.  Not that Yuki doesnt always look beautiful, but he looks extra special when I catch him unawares.

Oh I must go I think I can hear my mother calling me, no doubt shell want me to help out in her blasted shop!!"

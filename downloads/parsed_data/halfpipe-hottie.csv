new year, new journal...time for a change


this is the best song EVER!!


Papa Roach ""Scars""

i tear my heart open 
i sew myself shut 
my weakness is 
that i care too much 

and my scars remind me 
that the past is real 
i tear my heart open 
just to feel 

drunk and im feeling down 
and i just wanna be alone 
im pissed 'cause you came around 
why dont you just go home 

'cause you channeled all your pain 
and i cant help you fix yourself 
you're making me insane 
all i can say is 

i tear my heart open 
i sew myself shut 
my weakness is 
that i care too much 

and our scars remind us 
that the past is real 
i tear my heart open 
just to feel 

I tried to help you once 
Against my own advice
I saw you going down 
But you never realized 

that youre drowning in the water 
so i offered you my hand 
compassion's in my nature 
tonight is our last stand 

i tear my heart open 
i sew myself shut 
my weakness is 
that i care too much 

and our scars remind us 
that the past is real 
i tear my heart open 
just to feel 

im drunk and im feeling down 
and i just wanna be alone 
you shouldnt ever come around 
why dont you just go home 

cause youre drowning in the water 
and i tried to grab your hand 
i left my heart open 
but you didnt understand 

you fix yourself! 

i cant help you fix yourself 
but at least i can say i tried 
im sorry but i gotta move on with my own life 

i cant help you fix yourself

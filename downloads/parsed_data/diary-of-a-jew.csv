"event","so i made $6 at work today. and got to weed a garden. heck yes.

i went to delaney at like 11 with meg, hannah, and her friend molly. it was kind of creepy and dark.


so summer is pretty much over, and i'm not really excited for school per se but i'm ready i guess and i think senior year will be really good. 

its been a really great summer full of amazing events. some highlights include:

-Meg, Ver, and my late late night cape cod excursion
-Vacation in Wells with Amanda (particularly the last night)
-The forming of the OCOC and getting crunk on the beach
-My end of the summer party
-Killers concert (even though that was like 3 days before school ended)
-Flamboozling, McDonalds, and Maynard Cops all in the same night
-June cape trip to Ashley's house
-Isle au Haut with the cousins
-Spinnies in the Funmobile

and more which i can't remember now but will add later. overall, it has been good times indeed."

"event","OK
tonight meg, ver, katie and i caused plenty of mischeif and mayhem. it all started with a pleasant dinner at shiro. this was followed by us piling into ver's minivan, which (this is where it gets good) HAD NO BACK SEATS!!! it was just flat and open. me and meg hopped in the back and thrashed about in the van. it was SO FUN. like a rollercoaster/action movie where people get thrown around in some moving vehicle and hit the walls and flip around and stuff. i have bruises. then we went to target and played hide and seek. katie and ver were pretty good but me and meg were terrible. we were spotted in about 10 seconds. then we went, against my will, to see the Brothers Grimm. I said it would suck, and surprise, it did. we left after about half an hour and got our money back. then we did some SPINNIES IN THE FUNMOBILE!!!! that was awesome. then to end the night, we managed to find out were kelsey was and followed her on her date with some hudson kid from target. we followed his car from mcdonalds in a big circle back to tjmaxx. then we managed to lure kelsey into the funmobile and kidnapped her. it was hilarious. 

i also bought both the new death cab and kanye west cd's today. both are amazing."

"event","i am so fucking done with college stuff right now. if i have to look at one more college, i think i am gonna... oh wait i have to look at TWO MORE TOMORROW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!weqijeioqwsaisudh

yeah so, ashley, natalya, and I went and looked at Wesleyan (not impressed), U. Hartford (what a dump), and Trinity (gorgeous rich school in the middle of poor slum).... by the time I got home I was ready to skip college and become a fry cook at mcdonalds. anyways, tomorrow i'm seeing BU and Emerson, then next week is some NY schools and then the week after that i explode. 

after college stress i went out with amanda. we bummed around maynard and yelled at trashy people. it was fun.

ok anyways heres some nicer stuff to talk about. last week i went to the cape with Meg, Connor, Maddie, Natalya and we were joined by Donnie. it was SUCH a good time. by far one of the best parts of the summer (up there with Wells). we had some crazy nights on the beach, created the amazing OCOC club, went to a giant Wal-Mart 6 times, went to McDonalds 8 times, caused a car accident, watched a woman bike straight into traffic and hit a car and then get up and bike away, bought tupac shirts for $3, went to 3 beaches, had a crack addicted shifty-eyed waitress at a cheesy diner, bought a pair of massive size 42 underwear for $1, acted emo, and did a puzzle. it was gooooood times. 

later that week I also went to a free Spoon concert with Maddie, our work friend Liz, and her cousin. After the intense concert filled with so many emos and homeless people/old men with open shirts bumming cigs, me and Maddie went searching for the North End to get some pizza. We walked in the complete wrong direction and then took the subway, got lost some more, finally found a place, had THE BEST pizza for only $7 and then got lost finding our way back. then we also got lost in arlington trying to find a gas station. it was basically 4 hours of getting places and 2 hours of actually activity... 

Me and Meg also saw Red Eye which was good. and short. but good.

I haven't done any of my AP reading so I should go start..."

speaking of hair, I once again helped Meg dye hers today and I think I am becoming a pro.

I went to work at 2 at the cafe and they told me they didn't need me because it was so slow. too bad they couldn't have called me so I wouldn't have rushed over there and wasted gas. 

now I am waiting to go to shiro. sitting around waiting to go to work is the worst. also I am thinking that the best thing about going back to school is going to be Jimmy Qian. I sincerely miss that kid."

"event","SO TODAY I woke up BRIGHT and EARLY (approx. 7 am) to get up and go visit Connecticut College with Connor and his dad. I really liked it. It had a lot of really amazing features like a really pretty campus on the water, strengths in the stuff I want to study, a decent sized town surrounding it, and more. I think I will probably end up applying there but I don't know if its one of my top choices yet. It only has 2000 kids and that seems a wee bit small for my liking, but I think I could deal. I need to see more. The only other things I have seen are UVM and UNH. I actually like the city Burlington a lot better than New London but UVM is not as good a school as Connecticut. Oh well, whatev, enough college thinkin for one day...

THEN immediately afterwards, I rushed over to work (40 minutes late but surprisingly that was ok....) and closed the cafe with alicia mologna and scott sacra. Alicia is a wierdo and thinks that our jobs there are either ""love them or hate them"" so she says she HATES: taking out the trash, cleaning the grease trap, and taking out the mats, yet she ABSOLUTELY LOVES: mopping, sweeping, and dishes... I mean, I can understand prefering some over others, but straight out LOVING that kind of work gets me worried."

yeah so basically im dreading school a lot.

the end of summer better get better than this quick.

luckily tomorrow im going to a revs game with meg, katie, jenelle, kelsey and others so that should be fun and then saturday im going to the cape so that should be fun as well.

blahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. 

i cant sleep i think i have insomnia. the other night i was up till 4:30 and i fell asleep with my glasses on and woke up and they were still on.

also last night i took a frozen water bottle of ice out of the freezer and went up to my room to watch a movie and then i fell asleep but i was still holding the ice bottle and when i woke up it was still in my hands but melted and there was a puddle of wetness. it was quite odd. 

i watched a lot of seinfeld today. that show is funny.

my car is also fixed and i picked it up today.

also i got a new ringtone which is this charming man but the death cab version and its so cool so call me so i can listen to it please.

i am so poor. i really need to work.

i think i might go watch the hot chick. or at least the scenes with ling ling's mom because that always puts me in a good mood.

So I though ""HEY LIVEJOURNAL SOUNDS LIKE THE ANSWER!"" and now I'm here and stuff. 

Anyway....

My car broke down at 1 am a few weeks ago and this guy named Moses tried to help me but I told him I was already getting help from AAA. He looked under my hood and stuff anyway and then gave me his number and address and told me to ""come over if you get thirsty and want some juice or something."" He had a friend who, when introduced to me, simply gave me the peace sign. I didn't get home till three and then had to get up at seven the next morning to work an 8 hour shift at the cafe. Oh well I survived, but my car is still dead.

We went to borders and tried to reserve harry potter for mehg and experienced a lot of awkward animosity from the employees and some mothers and then we rented this movie called kinsey which ended up being all about sex. it was quite the film indeed. fun times. 

then lisa left and ver called in the midst of a boring stupor and we decided to try and find something to do. obviously, since its us, we found absolutely nothing to do. we decided to go to jordans without telling him but when we got to his house the lights were off and when we called him he didnt pick up. then we went to jenelles and got her, hoping she would have some brilliant idea, but alas, she also had no suggestions. so we called britney who was with sid and katie but she had to go home, but we did end up getting katie. so there i was with ver, jenelle, and katie and absolutely nothing to do. so we drove to mcdonalds but none of use were hungry so we drove around hudson and went in a big circle. then we honked at some kids who got angry. then we all went home. it was so pointless. 

on a better note, today is the first day in a very long time i have spent NO money at all. you should be proud of me. i'm saving my money now that my jobs are both closed."

then today i came home and my computer crashed and then came back to life4, i think it has schizophrenia. then me and ver went into boston to see chris's stand up thing. we ran into jordan and some other people at alewife and when we got there the room was 95% nashoba kids AND parents. anyhow, it was sooo funny and chris was HILARIOUS. that kid... i dont even know what to say. then ver went home with chris so i was all by my lonesome. that was fine UNTIL i came to pay the parking fee ($4.50) and realized i only had $2.50. so i am sitting there well the indian money collecting lady glared at me freaking out and i'm like SHIT SHIT OH FUCK WHAT DO I DO!!!! and then I LOOK NEXT TO ME... and there is pat and alicia thank fuck so i yelled over to them and alicia ran me over $2 and saved the day! thank god because for a second there is was scared like wo. 

overall summer has been sooooo boring so far. i thought summer would be like all parties and trips and fun times 24/7 BUT NO i basically just sit around and see my family or something. i think i did more fun stuff while school was still going on.... THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPENING! ok so my plan is just to plan A TON of fun things for the rest of the summer and just fill my life with so much excitement that i explode."

GRRRRRRRRRRr. I ended up in a shady place with a large gang of hoodlums looking at me funny in my suburban-mom volvo. the whole venture took me 2 hours. yeah... it wasnt too fun.

on a brighter note... the cape this weekend was wicked fun. it was me, ashley, natalya, donnie, lisa, and jordan. we had some sweet cookouts and went to the beach at night which was awesome and then wandered around falmouth center and went to the beach again but during the day. I got a bit of a burn.... but thats ok because its fading into a tan and now i can compete with verity more to prove that i am, in fact, better at life than her (her SAT scores were a major roadblock for me but i'm sure i will prove victorious in the end). overall it was a great weekend, i cant wait to go back to the cape next weekend, except then it will be visiting my grandmutha not me friends but oh well.

i CANNOT WAIT to see War of the Worlds. It's gonna own like wo."

Last weekend Trashley had a crazy party where I got to catch up with a lot of my old Stow friends who I just don't talk to anymore. Haha. That sounds really nice but in reality it was just me being a hilarious mess. Like a bajillion people showed up from out of nowhere or at least it felt like a bajillion to me! and I got to dance to GIRLFIGHT!

Last Tuesday I saw the Killers and Interpol in Boston. It was a great concert. The Killers are amazing live.

This weekend was a complete and utter mess. Amanda left for NY which sucks because I was looking foward to hanging out with her this summer. Then I somehow got caught up in a lot of stupid drama and got really pissed off. Overall there was just a lot of bad vibes going around last week. At least Mrs. Martin gave me the best curly hair and smile award.

Today was also a mess. My car was acting strange so I took it to the mechanic and he thinks my transmission might be broken. Which means the car is possibly dead to me. If I don't have a car i will go adhqwuiohdywhasihdqpwoisdqiowusdqw. On top of that my computer died (but i fixed it) and my cell phone now needs to be charged every two hours. Summer is getting off to a bad start.

Um its finals now and I failed chemistry today because it was a beast of a test but I don't even care because after wednesday... NO MORE SCHOOL TILL SEPTEMBER. Me and Meg also went to some Mexican restaurant in Acton today and that pretty much made up for all the bad in my life right now because tacos give me great happiness. 

Iron and Wine Wednesday, Cape Thursday! I'm excited."

I got my tux today. It's dead sexy."

"event","Today was dress like a prep day... but no one followed through with this but me. Thanks guys!

I fell asleep in math and had double chem because of MCAS. School was dumb.

Then my mom backed her car into mine while driving us to the dentist. She dented her car and cracked a tail light. Needless to say, she is mad because that car is her 3rd child. Then I had to go to the dentist. I'm cavity free. I'm proud.

Afterward I went to Shiro with meg and of course Verity showed up there as well because she basically lives there. This was followed by a trip to the mall where meg decided she had to go to Ben and Jerry's five hundred million times (i know all her coworkers by now). Then meg left for EMT and me and ver went to newbury comics. I bought Jay-Z's Black Album. That shit is bananas. He is my hero.

I am SO INCREDIBLY COMPLETELY poor right now. Between prom/car payments/gas/other expenses, I have like $75 left in the bank. This blows."

"event","Today was uneventful because I had work at the cafe and when I work at the cafe my day might as well not exist because I'm there for fricken ever. Especially Sundays when I can't even do anything at night. So today I overslept and my boss called me and was like ""you're late nate!"" which rhymes and so i got up and freaked out because I though I would get fired and then I rushed over and by the time I got there I was 4 minutes late. But amazingly when I got there they weren't really angry with me. My boss was just like ""Stop saying sorry, it happens. You have a good reputation at the cafe so its alright."" And then on top of that they put me in the busy section which makes the most money, and I figured they'd just stick me in the kids section out of pure anger. I ended up making like $130 in tips and it was my best day in at least a month. 

Last night I went to mr. nashoba which lasted fooooorevvvvvvvver, but Jordan won and his piano solo was incredible. Then a bunch of people came back to my house to watch The Life Aquatic (good movie) but I was just tired and Ashley made a mess out of my kitchen and made flat shirley temples.

Me and zach are gonna go see a movie now but I dunno which one. I don't even know whats playing, I'm just bored."

"event","Okay so my day sucked pretty bad. I woke up incredibly tired realizing I did no homework the night before. I went to school and almost fell asleep in every class and on top of that I bombed a math test and did not get any food at lunch because I was too slow and they ran out of everything. So sad. I also fought with everyone about the lyrics to that Missy Elliot song, I think its called ""work it"", and Meg put applesauce on me (shes pure evil)(pure turtle-killing evil).

Then to make things worse I went straight from school to work at the cafe. I had to close today which sucks so much more than waiting tables. I have to close with this 8th grader Emily and she is slow as MO-LASSES. I did all the kitchen clean up, vacuumed, swept, mopped, put the chairs up, did the trash, cleaned the chalkboard, and even had time to carry about 300 pounds of frozen food from the freezer to the hanger, all in the amount of time it took Emily to do the dishes. AND THERE WERE BARELY ANY DISHES!!!! That job makes me want to break stuff. But that doesn't matter any more because......

I THINK there are other people on Live Journal who go to Isle au Haut which is this kick ass island I go to in Maine every summer. It's my favorite place on Earth and apparently two other live journal people have it listed as an interest. I left them messages and hopefully they will respond and I can make Isle au Haut friends. New friends are good, they make me feel popular and cool."

"event","I just made this glorious livejournal at the request of a miss meghan miller who can be very pushy about making livejournals. LiveJournals are for emos so I will attempt to be as emo as possible in mine. That hot pic of me is me doing some prima ballerina ballet. My friend is a prima ballerina and I'm pretty much way better than her because I am nate the danCEUR! Yeah, that's right.

So I thought I hurt my wrist and my mom made me go to the doctor to get it checked out. So I go and Dr. Tripp at Acton Medical looks at it for about 10 seconds and then goes ""you have a ganglion cyst."" This was of course not what I wanted to hear, but what the hell I can dance like the shit so it doesn't matter. Anyways, he said not to worry about it and that it should eventually go away.

I'm hungry and want some gyoza."

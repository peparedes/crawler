"event","Rex,If u are wondering why everyone is stird about your choice in ur sexual tendacies is that you turned bi and we thought u where good. I am disturbed about the fact  and seirously have no clue what to think of it . This shit with Victoria is More a load of shit then a Manure factory. She is just holding on to becuase no one else would like her. She is a Leach and ur the prey. U could find better i am tired of her rex that victoria that. Quit the bullshit. U will not be merring her in the 10 years or so. This realationship with her is a load of shit. Rex I say this to all my friends YES i still consider u a friend. I am here.

i am gonna end my entry like i always do so here:

JOHN CLARE:

First Love

I ne'er was struck before that hour
With love so sudden and so sweet.
Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower  
And stole my heart away complete.  
 
My face turned pale, a deadly pale.
My legs refused to walk away,
And when she looked what could I ail
My life and all seemed turned to clay.  
 
And then my blood rushed to my face  
And took my eyesight quite away.
The trees and bushes round the place  
Seemed midnight at noonday. 
 
I could not see a single thing,
Words from my eyes did start.
They spoke as chords do from the string,
And blood burnt round my heart.  
 
Are flowers the winter's choice
Is love's bed always snow
She seemed to hear my silent voice  
Not love appeals to know. 
 
I never saw so sweet a face
As that I stood before.
My heart has left its dwelling place
And can return no more.

Great Poem on love rate it plz.....

OH AND I LIKE THIS POEM READ IT.
The Conqueror Worm 
Lo! 'tis a gala night 
Within the lonesome latter years! 
An angel throng, bewinged, bedight 
In veils, and drowned in tears, 
Sit in a theatre, to see 
A play of hopes and fears, 
While the orchestra breathes fitfully 
The music of the spheres. 

Mimes, in form of God on high, 
Mutter and mumble low, 
And hither and thither fly-- 
Mere puppets they, who come and go 
At bidding of vast formless things 
That shift the scenery to and fro, 
Flapping from out their Condor wings 
Invisible Woe! 

That motley drama--oh, be sure 
It shall not be forgot! 
With its Phantom chased evermore, 
By a crowd that seize it not, 
Through a circle that ever returneth in 
To the self-same spot, 
And much of Madness, and more of Sin, 
And Horror the soul of the plot. 

But see, amid the mimic rout 
A crawling shape intrude! 
A blood-red thing that writhes from out 
The scenic solitude! 
It writhes!--it writhes!--with mortal pangs 
The mimes become its food, 
And the angels sob at vermin fangs 
In human gore imbued. 

Out--out are the lights--out all! 
And, over each quivering form, 
The curtain, a funeral pall, 
Comes down with the rush of a storm, 
And the angels, all pallid and wan, 
Uprising, unveiling, affirm 
That the play is the tragedy ""Man,"" 
And its hero the Conqueror Worm.

"event","Hi everyone ; still no date for homecoming. Sigh,oh well fuck the preps at school with there ritualistic type things. Even though i feel left out it will still be fun because my friends angela and joey are going to be there and me and them will have a great time at the game and the dance. I thought about asking a girl out to homecoming but she has a boyfriend Sigh again does life really revolve around everyone else except me any who it doesnt matter becuase hopfully my friend billy will be there to he is the other only person who doesnt automattically judge someone on meeting them he is a fairlly nice person but he can get annoying sometimes but so can i so it doesnt really bother me. School is going good alot better than last year. so see yall at homecoming YEAGH

"event","i am feeling quite better with my friends. I finally got to talk to angela about the whole ordeal with her shoving me to the side. I am a moderatlly peacefull state of mind i am not tottally phyco(sp) anymore so i am good and feeling good. Except for the whole Homecoming thing still havent found a date and it sucks. Feels like this repulsive continus poking in the side. It makes me feel utterlly sickened to the stomach. Wish me the best of luck with that. Anyway, I am having diffuculty managing sports with school but i am getting that under control and dealing with the fact the rex and vic AGAIN omg when does it end. Does knowone ever learn. Oh and i decided to start ending my journal entries with a quote so do take me to be a total phyco for writing them and i will post my occasional poems i write or short stories that pop into my head. I warn u they are weird and sometimes have no ending so i'll have fun with that. Mostly this week i have looked for a date with no success and have had like 4 hour freaken football practices which really sucks ;but on the bright side i am have a moderatlly good day. Anywho, Goodbye for today.

"event","I have bene kinda depressed for the past two days. Maybe becuase homecoming is coming and i again probablly wont find a date and will stay home and eat choclate and watch the wizard of oz. This SUCKS. Does anyone else do this. IF so tell me so i can not be so depressed. Oh and i feel like my friends are drifting from esspecialy my friend Angela i wish she would notice that i sat down at the table or something. Just because u have a FREAKEN boyfriend does not mean u shun ur friends. This extremely pissed me off and i think i may just say screw it. I wanted to be her closest friend how can i do that when she does give a rats ASS about anything except her boyfriend."

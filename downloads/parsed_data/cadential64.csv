"event","<p>...because I never blog anymore and this is a cheap way of updating. :P And because I'm generally obsessed with all things fashion and always have been.<em><br /><br />Name an item of clothing that has been with you the longest</em>:<br />I'm actually drawing a blank here. I did a huge wardrobe overhaul last fall and got rid of my old stuff which was mostly dorky and outdated anyway. :P</p> <p><em>What&rsquo;s an article of clothing that you can&rsquo;t live without (BESIDES jeans, people)?</em><br /> A great winter coat. Right now it's a tie between my beautiful winter-white wool Guess coat and my classic wool-blend trench coat. <br />&quot;Put on a trench, and you're suddenly Audrey Hepburn walking along the Seine.&quot; - Michael Kors.<br />Amen to that. Never underestimate the classic, simple elegance of a great trench or trench-like coat. </p> <p><em>Describe your perfect winter &amp; summer footwear:</em><br /> Winter: knee-high, high-heeled leather boots worn over jeans or with a wool skirt. goes very well with a trench coat. ;)<br />Summer: tasteful, well-constructed flip flops to be worn with everything.</p> <p><em>What&rsquo;s a good, ethical clothing brand you&rsquo;d recommend?</em><br />No idea about clothing companies &quot;ethics,&quot; and don't particularly care, to be honest. As for recommendations though, I'd recommend <em>Seven for All Mankind</em> jeans to anyone. Despite the other great premium denim brands out there, Sevens are still an essential staple in every girl's wardrobe and the most basic. Their construction, fit, and washes are top-notch-- stylish, durable, timeless, and worth every penny.</p> <p><em>And what&rsquo;s a brand you wouldn&rsquo;t recommend?</em><br /> Anything that's shoddily constructed and falls apart. </p> <p><em>What&rsquo;s the ugliest trend of all time?</em><br /> Well, 3 things. The first, Without a doubt: <a href=""http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41D-R7it1GL._AA280_.jpg"">gaucho pants</a>. What could POSSIBLY&nbsp;be more unflattering? <br />Anything that makes even the most lean and statuesque women look shorter, stockier, and wider are a strict no-no. Anyone who has ever bought into this trend must epitomize the word &quot;lemming,&quot; for what reason on earth would compel a woman to put on such ridiculous attire? Unless you were wearing them to dress up as a gypsy for Halloween or something along those lines, there is no excuse for the abomination known as gauchos.<br /><br />Second...Overalls. but they don't count as a trend, as they are meant to be functional, not fashionable. <br /><br />Lastly, the footwear equivalent of gaucho pants is the atrocity of <a href=""http://christinaghuman.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/102907_crocs_a.jpg"">CROCS</a>. what are you doing wearing over-sized, clown-looking shower shoes out in public? 'nough said. </p> <p><em>And the prettiest?</em><br />Hands down: The classic, high-heeled, pointy-toed pump, especially in black. So simple and elegant and reliable, so sexy in the way it shapes your legs and improves your walk (or strut, if you prefer). And they are subtle enough to let the other parts of your outfit speak, which is sometimes just what you need.</p> <p><em>What colors predominate in your wardrobe?</em><br /> black. reds and pinks, white. Lots of black, which is something I'm trying to expand on...</p> <p><em>What are your vintage shopping strategies (if you have them)?</em><br />In the words of Rachel Zoe, &quot;I die.&quot; I'm afraid that vintage shopping would be the death of me. Fortunately for my bank account, I have neither the time nor resources to invest in vintage right now, but I&nbsp;can't wait to go vintage shopping in the future. </p> <p><em>What&rsquo;s the most insane piece of clothing that you have ever owned?</em><br />I've never actually owned anything that outrageous. Does a pink wig count? Hahaha...</p> <p><em>If you could describe the majority of the clothes you own in one word, what would it be?</em><br /> classy. :) sophisticated is the only way i roll. </p>"

Life in New York moves so quickly that 4 days later, I'm back, and I feel like I haven't even left yet. 

I've been on quite the emotional rollercoaster these past few days. 

Someone take me back to the city. Right now.

Anybody. 

Please.

Best. Fall break. EVER."

"event","<b>Memories that have a special place in my heart, Volume I. </b><br /><br />In no particular order, other than the order in which I whimsically feel like talking about them. I don't know how many installments this will have...<br /><br /><br />Flash back to July 4th, 2007. Nicholas and I, at the town docks in Wolfeboro Bay. The wind would not stop blowing like crazy, whipping my then waist-length black hair into tangles. It was Independence Day and I was in New Hampshire. The quaint town of Wolfeboro, middle-of-nowhere NH really came alive that weekend, a colorful, charming affair that was believe it or not, a refreshing respite from the usual andante pace of life in the idyllic resort town. Hundreds (no, not thousands and thousands of people...haha, sorry- inside joke!) of vacationers from all over New England lined the sidewalks of Main Street, the benches by the town docks, and Dockside Grill. Some traveled into town by boat and docked their speedboats and jetskis in the Bay. Many waited in line for the best ice cream in the entire universe at Bailey's Bubble, filled the gift shops in search of memorabilia that accurately captured what they were experiencing at that moment in time. People-watching during July 4th weekend was fascinating: everyone from Boston Red Sox fans, wealthy New England trophy wives and divorcees with big hair and hot red Mercedes coupes, sticky, sunburned, children and their exhausted parents, old ladies with the most adorable puppies, an interesting group of French foreigners, jolly, old retired men in Sebring convertibles, preppy, overprivileged teens looking for a good time-- were in town to celebrate this national holiday. I marveled at the classiness of the environment- wow, even the hicks up north aren't nearly as rough around the edges as the hicks in the south are! I thought. <br /><br />It was the second of six weeks of the Heifetz Institute, and the first time I'd seen downtown Wolfeboro during the daytime. I'd expressed my incredulity about the idea of the only coffee shop in town not having wireless internet (imagine that!), so we decided to check it out. It became the first of several pleasant trips to Lydia's, which became refreshing weekly escapes from the daily grind of practicing, lessons, and Communications classes. There was no place to sit in Lydia's, so we migrated to the town docks. Writing this now has prompted me to remember how the epic Lake Winnipesaukee looked that day: a distant blue-gray, a little foggy around the edges. Distant and foggy- that's how life seemed at that point in time, or, at least, my nebulous future and identity and where I was going in life all together. We watched the M/S Mount Washington dock, sound its deep, low, penetrating horn, exchange passengers, and sail off again, and vaguely contemplated the Board of Directors' boat cruise for us in the near future, jokingly tried to calculate the duration of the trip. There were ducks swimming so close to shore- mallards, and male ones, if I remember correctly, and they seemed happy and festive like the tourists. The wind was blowing so hard that the boats swung and bumped against the docks, and the water, choppier than ever, seemed to take on a life of its own. <br /><br />I remember, at some point, taking out the score to Beethoven op. 31 no. 3 and trying to go over what I'd learned in my lesson earlier that day, but the wind was blowing too hard and kept turning my pages. I was wearing my blue Tommy Hilfiger shirt with the red and white stripe across the middle in casual honor of this holiday. I sipped on my $5 banana-like smoothie, which didn't turn out to be all that great. We joked about how the ducks here would ever reproduce, since there didn't seem to be any females present. Countless numbers of people arrived and left at the town docks. There was no shortage of adorable dogs of all shapes and sizes, and Nicholas never failed to identify the breed/species of each one. I tried to pet one fluffy cute white puppy that resembled a sheep, but she wouldn't come to me. We discussed life at Heifetz so far, our chamber groups, repertoire, our ideal lives. Nicholas said he would conduct because it was the only way to have a chance to influence the orchestral repertoire; I told him I'd go to law school because studying law always intrigued me. We ran into my chamber music coach at Lydia's and it was a little awkward, especially when she suddenly disappeared afterward. I told him about my boyfriend. We examined the culture behind different instruments and what kinds of people certain instruments attract. I talked of my aspirations in classical music and of life back home, and found myself feeling unnervingly unconvinced about a lot of what I was saying. My life as I know it, my goals, the way I described myself- all felt oddly unsettling, in a way. And I think that that was the beginning of the end, somehow. I remember realizing that afternoon why I was a violinist at heart, considering perhaps that I'd picked the wrong instrument all along. A piano just can't sing the way a violin does. You play a note on the piano and it decays. When I listen to piano quartets or trios, I find myself longing for that sustained, singing line, a voice so close to the human voice, so much closer to the heart and soul of a person than something as seemingly abstract as a pianoforte. I felt so inadequate as a pianist. Was it possible that I loved music but didn't really love the piano? I pondered what could have been. My piano teacher, B. Snyd, showed up in his white pants, Teva sandals and button-down print shirt. In his silver Sebring convertible and festive, laid-back resort-town attire, one could hardly guess that this jolly man lived in the frigid gray of Rochester, NY all year long. I said hello, and it was a little awkward.<br /><br />The wind was overpowering. I was exhausted by the breeze, the conversation, the tasks before me. As we walked back to campus, I felt clumsy in my brown ""Jesus sandals"" from having been sitting for two hours. July 4th in a New England resort town was, to me, a dream. I loved it. Being there, living on a beautiful lake, surrounded by colorful tourists, feeling that quaint town come to life around me-- well, I could feel my heart turn upward into a big, irresistible smile. A peaceful, happy-to-be-alive smile inspired by the beautiful, fresh environment around me. <br /><br />Arriving back to the Brewster campus, I plodded across the lawn of Vaughan House, twisting the red lanyard of my room key between my fingers, turning down Nicholas's offer of the use of his violin anytime I wanted to play violin again. I refused, saying that I couldn't possibly play violin in front of actual violinists (haha, of course, then I was peer-pressured into playing a Guaneri and Vuillaume a week later, but these things happen). It was going to rain, and I wondered if the Institute's July 4th party would be cancelled that evening, along with the spectacular fireworks display. <br /><br />Back safely in my room, needing a break from everything, my head spun as I tried to digest the thoughts prompted by the conversation of the past two hours. I felt unsettled, sad, a little nostalgic. I had about an hour until Communications class (Public Speaking that week) and I was exhausted. My roommate was away for once at this time of day, and in the absence of her cello playing filling up our room, I heard the faint sounds of a violinist practicing next door. Too wound up to take a nap, I sat on my bed and cradled my laptop, mindlessly checking facebook&nbsp; and staring out the window.&nbsp; And then thinking, I can't do this right now, not after the the seriousness of the past two hours. I curled up and tried to take a nap, but couldn't. Something was different&nbsp; about me then. I think that that was the beginning, the day I began to question and welcome the possibility of&nbsp; different conclusions and expectations.  I was a violinist at heart. I was not a pianist. I wished that I could play violin. The first (and a small one at that) of many revelations that summer, the day I began to change in ways that would be unrecognizeable to the old me. Well, nearly. See, I tend to have this trouble and inability to let go of certain old ways, but that's another story. Something strange was happening to me, something had begun, although I didn't fully recognize it then. It's similar to the way the hairs on the back of your neck stand up when your body is alert for some nearby danger, or that tingling feeling you get when you anticipate something, even if you don't know it. <br /><br />There had been a rainbow in the sky that day. Zina wouldn't say what it was, but at lunch she kept insisting that I take a look outside at the sun, making it sound like there was some kind of crazy eclipse or that aliens had landed on it or something. Perhaps she was unsure of the English word for ""rainbow."" The rainbow was faint, barely perceptible, but clearly present. I wonder if that means anything, or if it ever did.<br /><br />That night I finished learning the last movement of the Ghost trio, it poured, and our party and fireworks were cancelled. What a night. And what a day. <br /><br />And I'm spent."

"event","...and so another adventure comes to an end.

but to make an end is to make a beginning, so I know that this pain is only temporary, that this isn't the real world, that this has all been a dream, my midsummer night's dream. Still, I'm allowing myself today to be sad, even though today is just another day that I get one step closer to finally becoming who I am really meant to be. It's not over till it's over...and I felt like this time warp would never end. Now I actually have to go out into the world and live. Normally, I'd be heartbroken on days like these, but the difference now is that I can save myself. I'm ready."

"event","The more things you have to blog about, the less time you have to blog. <br /><br />I haven't written much lately. There's a reason for that. Many, in fact. I feel so guilty for not writing much about this most incredible summer of my life. There I go again- my obsession with commemorating things, the unquellable urge to find ways to remember what it felt like to be there, to be alive in that exact moment. I'm such a nostalgic. It's painful at times. There have been so many times when I've wanted to write-- like every minute of my days here. It's just that so many things have been happening- on a daily basis as well as a spiritual one, and I honestly haven't had such a life-changing summer, or any era of my life-- since my first ""coming of age"" of sorts at the age of 16. <br /><br />I'm so sad to leave next week, even though I know it's time. Leaving here isn't like leaving any other place or anything else- it's the end of a monumental era and the beginning of the real, fearless, no-longer-afraid-to-be-myself Jessica. The people I've gotten to know and the things I've experienced over the past 5 weeks have given me the courage to  do what's right and what I really want...it hasn't been easy (good, bad, and ugly, actually), but basically, I feel so different because I'm finally in a place where I belong. No, I don't mean the actual town of Wolfeboro, NH, but the people, the environment, the values I identify with- those are what make home <i>home. </i>It's times like these when I remember how so very loved I am, and how love really finds you when you least expect it. <br /><br />And now I'm about to go ""home""- technically home, anyway. Why is this summer so different? Because I never got away from it all long enough to realize what I really need, what truly matters. And when I go back, things will never, ever be the same...<br /><br />It's times like these that inspire me to entertain the idea that maybe there must be a god after all...whatever god means or might be...<br /><br />I guess an update is in the works. To be posted eventually...sometimes you just have to enjoy living and not worry about commemorating it so much. I'm working on it. Living in the moment- I'm going to try my best to do that during the next 8 days, because god knows I'm going to miss this and look back upon it so fondly for the rest of my life."

"event","<b>[edit]<br />Cities like people<br /> </b>I think cities are like people, and living in a city is like being married to it. Atlanta, city of my birth, will always have a special place in my heart. But although we get along well most of the time and I can appreciate many things about it, we're not soul mates. I don't LOVE Atlanta, despite the fact that we've been married (okay, in a long-term relationship) for years now. Cities also <i>are </i>people as well- and if I, Jessica Jade, am a city, then I am Boston. People can tell right away that I'm not a Californian. People often mistake me for NYC (because I have expensive taste?) but I'm not truly an extrovert, nor wild, nor very social, nor terribly competitive, nor maniacally driven to success (err, money-making, economically speaking)...no, I'm more of the poetic, sensitive kind of person (although it maybe be hard to tell sometimes from my often-sarcastic front), and even if I am not those things, those are the very qualities I truly desire in friendships, relationships, people, places. Boston is a less-commercialized/less superficial and pretentious version of New York and I can appreciate that. It has more class. It's more of a place where you really can live deep and suck the marrow out of life rather than running to catch up or keep up and driving yourself crazy in the process. <br /><br />Anyway, like all people, cities have their good and bad sides, but the concept is what is important, not the details- if you love someone's fundamental character, then the little annoying things (in this case, the cold, the snow, the new england winter in general) might wear on you, but the essence that you love never diminishes, so you remain fulfilled. <br /><br />If you compare cities to people (of course, not everyone can be an exact fit), it all makes sense. If I'm Boston, I'm probably going to end up marrying another Boston one day. Or a New York. Are Boston and West Coast cities very compatible at all? Who knows- there are so many cities I haven't been to, after all! <br /><br />So yeah, just my random thoughts as I was practicing this afternoon. <br /><br />Public speaking class begins today. OH YEAH. If I'm good at one thing, it's talking. And being opiniated. hah. I realized that I feel most comfortable in interview settings (well, ones in which I actually know what I'm talking about anyway) because social skills are something I feel confident in after all these years. I feel like I really can't go wrong in situations like those. And anytime I get to talk to a readily available and captive audience, I'm happy! :D<br /><b><br />Sunday 01 July 2007<br />11: 38 pm<br /></b>Before I do/write anything else, I MUST write about my inaugural trip to Boston.<br /><br />I'll never forget the moment I laid eyes on Boston, MA for the first time. After the two-hour car ride and numerous toll roads had lulled me to sleep, I awoke to the sound of Julia and Jannecke's exclaimations: <i>we're here! </i>We're in Boston! <br /><br />As we exited off I95 toward MassAve and drove through the Callahan Tunnel (maybe not in that order?), I took one look at the place and pretty much fell immediately and violently in love with it right then and there. Of course, I tend to have a very romantic view on things. Let's face it: I'm a perpetual tourist and that's how I live my life. I have a terribly excitable and intense view everything I experience. Anytime I visit a famous place, being there just seems so much more significant- I feel like I finally get to see, in the flesh (figuratively), a place that so many people before me have come and gone before me. My mind takes me back to all the things I learned in fourth-grade history about the American Revolution and Paul Revere's midnight ride and the Tea Party and all that. I think of all the movies and books that have taken place here, of my friends as well as famous people who have gone to school here. You just can't argue that Boston is, in fact, a very <i>important </i>city. And when I walk the streets, I think of all those who have talked here centuries ago as well as in recent years, of how this place feels like home to them, of the mixture of familiarity and wonder that they must find in it. <br /><br />I've never seen any place like it. The novelty is overwhelming. Boston is downright beautiful. Gorgeous, in fact. I've always found New York City to be glorious, the skyscrapers like goddesses rooted firmly in the ground but also towering up as a symbol of achievement. NYC has always represented, to me, a sense of accomplishment and innovation. But Boston is the <i>real </i>American Dream, it's organic demeanor so much more inviting than New York's austerity. I love everything about it: the colonial-style architecture and gold-plated store signs, the cleanliness, the stylishness of the tourists and residents that walk up and down the streets. Forget what Jude Law's character says in <i>Alfie </i>about the most beautiful women in the world residing in New York- Boston takes the cake. People look great here and dress trendily, but not in a homogenous way like you see on college campuses. If they wear designer labels, they wear them well. There are lots of people walking their cute, adorable, dogs, ranging from purse-sized to um, full-sized (how do you describe dog sizes anyway? like small, medium large? haha). The Seven-Eleven there is probably the nicest-looking Seven-Eleven I've ever seen. <br /><br />Driving around the city looking for parking was a great aesthetic experience. Drove past Berklee College of Music, Church of Christian Science (that thing is HUGE), lots of nice-looking apartments, the Boston Pops, the street that NEC is on...We valet-parked on Newbury Street ($10/hr, not bad because there were five of us). Newbury appears to be the Fifth Avenue of Boston, an orgasm of designer boutiques, with well-dressed young people, adorable children and pets strolling the wide sidewalks. There are also some nice restaurants here, but kind of pricey. We spent quite a bit of time in Boston Commons, which is like Central Park but 10,000x more beautiful-- almost reminds me of this Japanese garden I went to in San Fransisco nearly a decade ago. There were at least three different weddings in the city that day, and I got to see three different wedding parties take post-ceremony bridal portraits in the park. Oh gosh, what a dream wedding that would be! Seeing them made me so happy and I hope that I'll have such a beautiful wedding one day. I tried to get a group picture in front of Paul Revere's monument (which would have been SUCH a great picture) only it turns out that the guy didn't actually TAKE the picture, so nothing showed up! How annoying...too bad I didn't realize this until later. Boston is fairly diverse- mostly white people and Koreans, Indians (Zina got a fabulous picture of these three Indian girls just sitting on a park bench reading books quietly- never seen something like that before; trust me, it was unique), not a lot of black people, I don't think. I go to the most homogenous school ever, so it was nice to see that not everyone dresses the same/acts the same elsewhere. Of course, if I went to school in Boston, I'd probably notice different trends.<br /><br />Stopped at a bar/restaurant near the subway station for a drink and a break. Had a nice glass of wine, and we meandered along the Charles River taking pictures of the townspeople and enjoying Boston Harbor. Sorry to disappoint; I did not, in fact throw tea into the harbor. hah. It's such a pity we couldn't stay long. On the drive home we got to see the sunset, and I totally wanted to go to Cape Cod- ONE DAY! I also saw a lot of things I can no longer remember in detail; thankfully I have the pictures. Shopped at H&amp;M because I <i>had </i>to since it's so overhyped and it's not in the south and is therefore inaccessible to me all the time. It's crowded and the sizes are weird and nothing fit, and those are clothes you can buy anywhere else but <i>omg it's H&amp;M </i>so there's such a frenzy there. Yes, it is tax-free in Boston to shop there, but really, the clothes are cheaply made and not high-quality or well-fitting. It's a good place if you have hours to dig through sale bins and such, but no way would I spend all that time and energy on clothes that obviously are not my style nor made for my body type. We saw a Porsche limo. And a hot red Ferarri. And some really sweet-ass cars parking along the side of the street. <br />There are so many things I want to do there and I can't wait to go back, whenever that may be. NEC doesn't give much scholarship money, so I doubt it's worth my while to apply there. Maybe I'll try BU instead? I didn't do nearly enough in Beantown yesterday; it's such a shame. But Boston is a city with culture, history, great schools, and modern attractions- what's not to love? Okay, so it's not as exciting as NYC, it has no MET or NY Phil or Met Opera or all those other great NYC things. I heard that everything closes at 10 and that it's a nice place to settle down and raise children, but not a place to be when you're young and beautiful. I DO agree with the raising children part- I'd love to raise my future family in a place like Boston. But the quiet, intellectual nature of the city appeals to me so much...it's very compatible with me because those are the qualities I like in people and in places. It's a good place to think, write, learn, observe, enjoy...and even though it's bleak and freezing in the winter, no amount of snow could diminish the amount of unique character that the place has. I think I would love it just as much in December.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the government there, but that's another story. Other than that, I really need to spend some quality time there. I know I don't have nearly enough information yet, but to me, Boston is a dream. If I can ever afford to live there, I'd like to. It is so beyond wonderful and I wonder why I waited 21.5 long years to see it. There's a line in Eva Hoffman's <i>Lost in Translation </i>that sums up what Boston felt like, the history, the culture, the character...(paraphrased badly by me, since I don't have the text with me): <i>It was like beholding nature with a primeval curiosity, as though never had ever been seen or done before. </i>Something like that. Something pioneer-esque. Like I said, Boston is such an important city.<br /><br />I know I probably have grass is greener syndrome in thinking, how could anyone want to live in a place like the&nbsp;<b>s</b>outh if they'd ever experienced the northeast? I love the north eastern US. Why did I grow up in Atlanta again? Ah, whatever. :) I just thought I'd commemorate how at this moment in time, I am completely head-over-heels in love with Boston and it's wonderful. Most of all, I learned that as beautiful as Wolfeboro, NH is...I'm such a city girl at heart. Nothing makes me feel alive like a big city. Especially a big, beautiful one. What a great weekend respite from the lonnnnng grueling work week at the Heifetz Institute. <br /><br />And now: Heifetz Week 2, coming right up. <br /><b><b><br />Saturday 30 June 2007<br />12:38 pm<br /></b></b>Today, I get to see BOSTON, MA for the first time!<br /><br />I'm beyond excited. It's 69 degrees right now and perfectly picturesque. <br /><br />Nicolas is a lifesaver for loaning me his digital camera for the day since mine is out of commission. The city is going to look so gorgeous on a weekend like this.<br /><br />We're leaving at 1 pm and planning to arrive back here at 9 so that we can practice at least 2 more hours tonight. I'm ready to tackle the 2nd movement of the Ghost trio tomorrow!<br /><br />See you when I get back. :)"

"event","...literally. That's what summertime in New England is. I've been here two days and I really love it. <br /><br />I'm here and I'm alive. The nightmare of getting here began in earnest when I missed my 9:22 am flight to Manchester. Took off 10 minutes before I got to the counter. Fuck you very much, TSA. Extremely long story short-- 285 traffic jam caused by guy in blue gym shorts who nonchalantly overturned his matching blue truck. Delayed arrival to Hartsfield for 20 minutes. MASSIVE, unprecedented glut of people in Security- line began at friggin BAGGAGE CLAIM, wrapped around the atrium well before we got to the snake-like ropes like usual. And, like rush hour traffic on I85, nothing was moving. Even after a Delta agent expedited me through after I almost burst into tears (they weren't even going to let me through even though my flight was leaving in, oh, 20 minutes) and I still missed it. I didn't stand a chance. Simply too many people and too many liquids (re: ""liquides"") present to allow me to make it to the terminal on time. I wrote a rant about this whole situation but it's unpublishable. Censored. I am not the kind of person who remains calm in emergencies. Ideally, I wouldn't have anxiety attacks over something I simply can't control. But I freak out anyway. <br /><br />I know Hartsfield like the back of my hand now. During my 5 hour wait, I got daily workout walking through concourses. Was lucky enough snag a standby flight to Manchester at 2:50. Finally got to Brewster around 7 pm. It was raining here. I didn't mind.<br /><br />The lush green that is the arial view of New Hampshire was striking. I'm used to flying over GA where the suburban cookie-cutter images and construction sites look really ugly from that high up. But NH is beautiful- from the plane, I saw lots of trees, large expanses of grass, an occasional house surrounded by big, landscaped lawns, each house unique, standing on its own, unlike the suburbs of Atlanta. The lurching shuttle ride from Manchester to Wolfeboro was also a spectacle- this is a whole new planet to me! The architecture, the roads, the feel of the town-- is so quaint, old fashioned, remote- but all in a very pleasant and calming way.<br /><br />Here I sit in Wolfeboro, America's oldest summer resort- live, from Brewster Academy. It's great to be able to somewhat experience what I've read so much about! That whole New England prep school environment that always seemed so Hogwarts-esque/cozy/academic/evocative to a preppy girl like me. <i>Dead Poet's Society, A Separate Peace</i>- both which are stories I love, all took place at a school like this. Granted, this isn't Exeter, but it's a similar environment. This is all so very romantic to me. The books I read do affect me a lot!<br /><br />Facilities here are awesome. Buildings have odd hours and Brewster is strict, but the dorms are so nice- wood paneling, carpet, comfortable beds, ample floor space, it's clean...and the academic buildings are everything I imagine that a prep school would look like. For the festival, they have pianos in every room (Yamaha grands wrapped in Syran Wrap because they have to sell them at the end of the festival! haha), practicing in classrooms with big windows (so much less depressing than UGA!) and also great views of the campus/lake. I live in Vaughn House, which is actually A HOUSE, not the high-rise type college dorms I'm used to frequenting. Every dorm is a house, and we even share ours with a family that lives on the other side of the wall (the dad teaches at Brewster). It's so home-y and cozy. No wonder tuition is so high- it takes a lot to rent/maintain a place like this. Did I mention that I love on the lake? Well not directly ON, but close enough. Just a large green field of grass away. The view is breathtaking. I look out the window and I see Lake Winnipesaukee/Wolfeboro bay- expensive lake houses, boats...ohhh, it's so beautiful. it's so quintessential New England. Sunset here is to die for! <br /><br />Practice space/time is not a problem. They don't schedule a lot of things here, so all you do is practice. For long stretches of time every single day. Good thing, because I have so much to get done. <br /><br />I can swim! They have lap lanes in the lake. Too bad the beach is open to swimming at odd hours. :( Went for a walk/run today with Jannecke and Cory on the road behind the beach - saw Brewster Beach, as well as crazy expensive lake houses- looks so aristocratic in that old-money New England way, and believe me, these are only their summer homes. Even the driveways to these houses are amazing, and their lawns too...everything here is so unique and has so much character. Some of the lakefront property looks, from some angles, like something out of <i>The Great Gatsby. </i>There's a colonial-style dorm next to mine with a nice back porch. <br /><br />The Carpenter Building, which is where all the pianists practice/have lessons, is a historical building and has to be treated as such. Meaning it closes at like, 3:30 pm because someone from that school (it's an elementary school) has to be present in order for people to be in it. Blah. Good thing the main academic building has pianos available all the time!<br /><br />I haven't been into town yet. Past two days have been spent preparing for my ""jury"" tomorrow. Evaluation in front of the ENTIRE faculty. Most people went today and were discussing their pieces at dinner. We have to play a scale in whatever mood they tell us- ""angry"" ""happy"" etc. And then we have to say what emotion we're trying to communicate in this piece (one of the goals of this festival is for us to be good communicators about our music, not just...for us to play). Op. 31 no. 3: innocence. Is that an emotion? Whatever; it's what I've determined. And the piece IS so so soo totally about innocence in a retrospective way. No bad feelings, everything is very diatonic. Not even any melancholy, just agility and grace. The movement does, however, have late-Beethoven characteristics- hinting at the introspective and philosophical nature of his late sonatas. So it's like someone looking back on their childhood with no hard feelings. I mean, come on, it's in E-flat Major. So I'm a little nervous. I don't like having DVDs made of me, either! There's a lot at stake for all of us, because this is for chamber music placement. And even though I already have my piece, I want to have good people playing with me! So I have to fool the faculty into thinking I'm good, too! ;)<br /><br />Two hour orientation today was, well, long. Say what you want to about Daniel Heifetz- but I admire the man for having the initiative and getting the resources to fund a program like this. He clearly has a philosophy about performing that he's trying to advocate, and the mission statement of the Institute is well-defined and realistic. Dunno about thew hole memorizing chamber music sonatas, though. I don't agree with that, but, well, I'm not playing a sonata this summer, so there. Oh, the rules are pretty relaxed here since I'm 21. <br /><br />Horacio Guitierrez is NOT coming. Oh, the disappointment. He was playing some great stuff, and I wanted to be in his master class! Alas. He is getting surgery. I hope all goes well. It's too bad. He's the one I was really after. <br /><br />All the college students here are either from Eastman, Peabody, Manhattan School, or NEC. I have met like, 3 people who go to universities, myself included (I've met me, as one might expect). So being here is sort of like being at a conservatory. This is a studious bunch- not so party-centric like Brevard. Brevard was so much more diverse (in terms of instruments and types of people), but places like this are what I need- this is the perfect part of the world to spend a summer reading, writing a novel, studying music...it's very focused. <br /><br />Concerts are mandatory attendance. Celebrity concert series happens Thursday. Mon/Wed are the Stars of Tomorrow concerts- student recitals. There are also opportunities to perform in the community, something I'm definitely interested in. Can't wait till this camp really gets started. I also can't wait for recreation days- speed boating/inner tubing, the hot springs/hiking, the board of trustees boat cruise around the lake...ahhhhh so exciting!<br /><br />The weather here is SPECTACULAR. 71 degrees at the most. Fifties (often low fifties) at night. It's PERFECT. Especially after leaving the 90 degree sauna known as Georgia weather. Ugh. I could get used to this. They tell me it gets much hotter but I hope that's not the case.<br /><br />Cool people I've met so far (as many/much as I can remember about them):<br />Haimi- my roommate, a Korean cellist from Peabody. Rising senior, like me.<br />Cory- my RA. violist. was here last year. <br />Nicolas- Italian violinist from LA who goes to Manhattan School. former professional actor who has appeared on <i>Ally McBeal </i>and in McD's commercials. no, they don't make the people in the commercials eat the food, just so you know.<br />Miyoumi and her sister (I forgot her name!)- pianists from San Fransisco. They're young- 12 and...14, 15? Extremely Californian.<br />Alex- what I like to call a ""California Asian""- so west coast. <br />Seigi- grew up in Miami. <br />Casen- cellist from Colorado.<br />Pier- violinist at NEC. he is Jonathan Deans incarnate. It's uncanny. They have all the same mannerisms and everything! Except Pier is brunnette. He is such a character- so animated. <br />Alex- his classmate at NEC. They won a lip-syncing contest singing the Gaston song from <i>Beauty and the Beat. </i>rofl.<br />Jonathan- violinist from James Madison University. Really cool and laid-back guy.<br />Julia H- pianist from Eastman. Studied with Schumacher! Commented on his ""batty ways""- haha, apparently everyone thinks Schumacher is crazy or a lot to handle for 4 entire years.<br />Talia- violist from UIllinois. She knows Sam from the LaGrange competition! Small world. She has a car here.<br />Jannecke- also a pianist from Eastman<br />Nari- violinist from Eastman. lives next door. <br />Xena- not sure how to spell her name. Beautiful blonde/blue-eyed Russian violinist from Moscow Conservatory. <br />Juan- Spanish (from Spain literally!) cellist at Peabody. We met because he locked his cello inside his room and lost his key right before his audition tonight. He has the kind of accent that lots of girls will go crazy for. <br />Cello faculty member that looks like a bigger, older version of Martin- I think he teaches at Peabody. I forgot his name. But yea, from a distance he looks like Martin. His daughter, who is...3? is blonde/blue eyed. WOW talk about the revenge of the recessive genes! It's uncanny.<br /><br />I know I'm forgetting a lot of people. I swear I'm the only one here who is from below the Mason-Dixon line (or, as Brad would say, the <i>Manson-Nixon </i>line. hahaha). Such a drastic change from the very very very Southern culture of UGA and such. This is so much better than the South so far. Well, there is Seigi, our resident Miamian, but that's Latin America and doesn't count.<br /><br />This is a very morning-centric place. No one sleeps late because who'd want to miss the crisp, fresh morning air and beautiful morning view? I'm so much more productive than I am at home.<br /><br />This and Brevard, the only other festival I've been to, are so so so different. This is so much more my style, although Brevard was necessary. We don't have to do work-study to earn our scholarship money. We don't have to clean bathrooms. Bugs are minimal indoors. I don't live in a freaking cabin. There's a beautiful gorgeous lake and not a little dinky one. The food is not bad at all. It's so clean. Wolfeboro is so conservative and quaint and the people here aren't much into being social, so I've gathered. But it hasn't really started yet, so we'll see. Like I said, I could get used to this environment. I'd most likely long for the city after a while, but spending peaceful days here as a break is so refreshing. If I had that much money one day...I'd live here. Not here, per se...but well, I'd love to summer here. The wind howls against the windows at night. Not tonight, though. <br /><br />The types of people around these parts are so different. They say there are some sketchy townies, but near campus there are only rich, old folks summering around these parts. The plane I flew here on seated only about 30 people. We had to walk out to the runway to board. Smaller plane = claustrophobic, but better service. Extra snacks. The conversations people had around me were much more interesting and more relatable than anything I get in the south.&nbsp; I also noticed that northeners are not overly- tall like southerners. I'm used to everyone towering above me, which is actually not the case here. Why is it that people in the south are so freaking tall? Not that I don't love tall guys or anything, because, obviously, I do. :) 6 ft guys = hot. :) 6 ft girls? Not hot! Wait...haha oh, you know I'm just saying this because I'm jealous of tall girls and wish I could be 5'10 so that I could be a supermodel and not be broke for a change.<br /><br />Cingular sucks here. Phone works in a few spots on campus. So email me if you need me. Internet works in the dorms just fine. And if you must call, do so after 9, as I'm sure my minutes are long gone by this point. <br /><br />My ex called me for relationship advice today. What is the world coming to? Haha, just kidding. It was a good talk, and yes, you can be friends with an ex.<br /><br />There is a Rite-Aid here! Thank goodness. I only brought travel sized toiletries.<br /><br />Okay, first obligatory, rambly, first-impressions entry drawing to a close. Tomorrow is the walking tour of campus, chamber music orientation, my audition (ahh!) and then some. So much work to get done, so little time! I have to get up early everyday, so goodnight! I'll tell you more stories as they happen. This is only the beginning...only the beginning.<br /><br />It's so freaking beautiful up here. I think New England + me were meant to be, but it could just be the honeymoon phases clouding my judgment. Either way, it feels great up here. I'm all full of NRE (new relationship energy) in this infatuation with New England. Might as well enjoy it!<br /><br />I don't know how long I can keep these entries public because gone are the days of carefree blogging, and I'm paranoid that the people I'm writing about will read this- just so you know. If we're not livejournal friends already, just leave a comment and I'll add you. That is, if I know you. <br /><br />Took some pretty pics of campus to day. To be posted eventually; stay tuned, my avid readers (har har)!"

"event","WOW. Today I met the rudest person I've ever encountered in my life. Attention friends and readers: racism and rudeness is alive and kicking in the South today. <br /><br /><b>The time</b>: 4pm. June 21st.<br /><b>The venue</b>: Walgreen's candy aisle<br /><br />I tiptoe around an old lady who is perusing sweets and innocently reach for a bag of Haribo gummies. The following scene ensued, verbatim (oh yes, I memorized this just for blogging purposes):<br /><br /><b>Me: </b>*reaches for gummi bears*<br /><b>Rude/Dumb Old Lady (R/DOL): </b>You're excused.<br /><b>Me: </b>Thank you! (David Sedaris style, a la <i>SantaLand Diaries</i>)<br /><b>(R/DOL): </b>*Turns her back. Does not budge.* <br /><br />*author's note: before i even got there, she had her back turned the entire time in the first place. also, she seemed to be on her way out. my reach for the Haribo bears did not invade her personal bubble at all, and any sane person (re: anybody who has all gray matter intact, if that's too much to ask for) wouldn't even think to be offended. honest. <br /><br />(<i>since she is obviously being so rude, I refuse to dignify her rudeness by moving. so i stand. i pretend to browse the candy aisle even longer, staring a hole into the Happy Colas package).<br /><br /></i><b>(R/DOL): </b>Five...(four...three...two...)<i><br /></i>(<i>haha, is this lady for real? i remain silent). <br /></i><b>(R/DOL): </b>Go back where you came from. And learn some manners. I have them. You don't.<br /><i>wow. just, wow. OH THE IRONY. does she really think that a poorly-executed racist remark is going to offend me? send me running, crying into a dark closet where i shall rock back and forth at being belitted by someone who is obviously uh... more polite than i am? uh...right.<br /></i><b>Me: </b>Thanks. I love you, too. And yeah, that's a shame. Because I'd love to turn out just like you. <br /><b>(R/DOL): </b>*mumbles ""fuck this""* and then storms off. <br /><i>mmm. CLASSY!<br /><br /></i>I don't know whether or not I'm mainly surprised or amused. Yes, if I were classier, I wouldn't have mouthed off to her like that and would have just walked away, perhaps. Obviously she's not worth my time. However, I am never rude to people on the offense- that is, I never try to be rude when there's no reason to be. However, I refuse, refuse, refuse- out of principle and out of pride (but mostly principle), to dignify her bigotry by bowing in submission- I'm sure she expected me to apologize profusely and let her have her precious candy-watching time back, or something. I know that my mouth will be the death of me- unlike most people, I'm brash enough (or impulsive enough, for better or for worse) to never let anyone walk all over me. You see, I know that I was not wrong in the first place. I didn't reach IN FRONT of her to take something she was looking at. No, I remained in my own space to her left the entire time. If I were wrong, I'd apologize, no questions asked. I have no problem admitting my mistakes when I'm wrong. I'm stubborn, and most of all, I refuse to let anybody else, especially anybody as rude as her and has the nerve to not only think she's better than me, but to think that she's polite!- treat me badly. You get what you give. You treat me rudely, I'll mouth off to you in return. Don't give me a reason to be on the defense, and there will be no problems. What pisses me off most of all is that I know she'll go home and tell her husband and kids (god forbid people like that be allowed to reproduce) about this horribly rude Asian girl and how she needs to ""go back where she came from"" and how all the immigrants are taking over the world or something. She'll remain in her close-minded, utterly ridiculous worldview until her last gasping breath upon her death bed. And those close to her will do the same. I am one of the most easily-annoyed people I know, and even I, had I been in her place, would have just walked away instead of called someone out if they, say, invaded my personal bubble or whatever she thinks I did. No matter what, to pull the race card was really, really low of her, and I simply will not tolerate that. She probably thought I was some meek, submissive little Asian whore with low self-esteem or something. Haha. Obviously she picked the wrong person to mess with, and only succeeded in raising her probably already precarious (by the looks of her) blood pressure. <br /><br />As a rule of thumb, it's never wise to be rude to anybody; you never know who they might be, if they're connected to your friends or employers or if they might one day be in a position of authority over you. Don't burn any bridges...just in case. Oops. But I really saw no alternative today in that Walgreen's candy aisle. I mean, GOD FORBID I stand up for myself! I could have let her walk all over me, but I'd only feel like a weak fucker afterward. So I did what I had to do, consciously and deliberately.<br /><br />Alas, I am not witty on the spot. I, like most people, think of a thousand and one great comebacks after the fact. But this is what I wanted to say:<br /><br /><i>I'm sorry, <b>sir. </b>Are you trying to make a joke? Hahaha? You might want to check to see that your insults are accurate so that they have a chance of being effective. Newsflash: I was born in raised in the great state of Georgia (ha), you know, the South, where manners are paramount. Forget Emily Post! You, obviously, are the shining paragon of virtue here. I mean, you're being SO POLITE right now it's killing me. Anything else I can get you? A bag of candy? Botox? A lobotomy? Oh, and why don't you open your very own etiquette school while you're at it? Because mmm racism and rudeness...I GOTTA get me some of that! Oh. One more thing. Your village called. Their idiot is missing. </i><br /><br />But of course, less is more. I wouldn't really say those things to her out loud. Real class is just walking away from someone who is obviously beneath you. So here I am, sitting at my computer, ranting on my blog and eating gummi bears instead. This outrageous moment of the day brought to you by Haribo Hungaria Kft."

"event","So this is the kind of stuff I stay up all night thinking about...<br /><br />Litlove's literature blog <a href=""http://litlove.wordpress.com/"">Tales From the Reading Room</a> has been a favorite of mine for some time now, although I don't read regularly because it often overwhelms me- intellectually and with guilt, reminding me that I do not read nearly enough, conjuring up bits and pieces and memories of books and authors I've been exposed to throughout the years. If I didn't go the musical route, I'd definitely aspire to be an English professor, no joke. <br /><br />It's great to see someone's personal interpretation on some of my own favorite books. Any Philip Roth fans present? She recently wrote about <i>The Human Stain </i><a href=""http://litlove.wordpress.com/2007/06/07/philip-roths-the-human-stain/"">here</a>. JACKPOT! Read it in freshman English and it is by far the most enigmatic, complex, and brutally honest novel I've ever read. Philip Roth is genius^100. He's at once scathingly hilarious, irreverent, dark, insightful about the human condition in the most unforgiving way. I will never, ever fully understand the meaning of his allusions- his allusions to <i>Symphonic Dances, </i>Mahler 3, Shakespeare, the novel's format into a 5 act Aristotelian tragedy ...but it's so much fun tying my brain in knots thinking about it from time to time. I remember doing an extra credit assignment on the significance of the musical works mentioned in the Tanglewood scene (it was fun research), and writing a rambly 1500 word mess of an essay on the book for my final exam. And still not understanding it. This book is so unforgettable to me because I relate to many aspects of the characters or at least find them intriguing- the whole race/roots/family identity, ideas about innocence, reconstructing the past, purity, Hawthorne's &quot;persecuting spirit,&quot; the politics of morality (this one makes me angry grr), what fate really is (I agree with Roth on this one)...etc. And oh. the IRONY. it's the most ironic story ever. Anyway, litlove's analysis is superb; she succinctly outlined the main ideas of the novel and I found her insight very helpful. Of course, now I can't sleep because I want to stay up all night re-reading passages of <i>The Human Stain, </i>or at least re-reading my essay about it to see what I thought back then. A re-read is definitely on the menu. Eventually. See, there are so many books I haven't read even for the first time...I want to read another Philip Roth novel but I'm afraid that my brain will crash.<br /><br />Litlove's <a href=""http://litlove.wordpress.com/2007/06/15/first-love/"">latest entry</a> (about an Alice McDermott novel <i>That Night</i>)-- got me really interested in reading McDermott again. I read halfway through her <i>Charming Billy </i>sophomore year in high school, but I totally couldn't appreciate her style...I do recall, however, that her stories are very heartbreaking because she tells them in such a heartwrenching way. <i><span>The power of McDermott&rsquo;s writing lifts even this intriguing premise into a new dimension, however, for she manages to compose a profound meditation on the nature of love out of her resolutely ordinary characters. Love is, as she so poignantly demonstrates, what lifts us out of the standard run of humanity and makes us chosen, special, new to ourselves. Yet what this book so hauntingly considers is the supreme and magnificent moment of love against the backdrop of the relentless ruthlessness of life; the way life insists that even something as precious and glorious as love be set aside, forgotten, labeled irrelevant. </span></i><span>Couldn't have said it better myself- and, you know, that paragraph reminds me of the movie <i>Titanic. </i>Stop laughing- I could honestly write an essay on why <i>Titanic </i>is one of the most true and greatest love stories I've ever encountered, but that paragraph pretty much says why already. Besides, I already did that before, <a href=""http://cadential64.livejournal.com/3601.html"">sort of</a>. But I digress.<br /><br />I really miss taking English classes and reading novels constantly. Dammit I think I'm going to register for an English class this semester or something because it's probably my last chance to take an English class, ever. I remembered today that <i>Green Eggs and Ham </i>was the first book that I ever enjoyed reading. Ever. in this entire life of mine. You never forget your first. <br /><br />I started reading Hannah Green's <i>I Never Promised You a Rose Garden </i>a few weeks ago but am not sure if it's still worthy of my time investment. It's good, but old fashioned...reminds me a lot of <i>Of Human Bondage, </i>which was great, but not my kind of book, at least not then. I'd love to finish that one day. <br /><br />I've been learning Bach all day. Learning Bach, like reading Conrad, is like watching paint dry on a wet day. One prelude down, one fugue to go. (A Major from WTC II). Kill me now. Ah, so much piano stuff to do...so little time. Gotta get some sleep so I can finish learning the trio tomorrow as well as more Liszt and Beethoven...<br /><br />goodnight. :)</span>"

"event","<span>From an old entry I dug up, one of those long, rambly, contemplative things that I spent hours writing for myself because I never want to forget. <br /><br />Contrary to what most people believe, it doesn't always take years to know a person. You see, once you understand a concept and how it functions, the details don't really matter-- as in, it's not the amount of knowledge you have that allows you to really know a person, it's your understanding of how they function. The concept can always be applied to the details, and what is important is that you ""get"" the person and that they ""get"" you. You can know someone in a day. You could interact with someone every single day over decades and still never know them. Best friends, soul mates...they're like puzzle pieces: they either fit or they don't, you either click or you don't, you either have the potential to ""get"" each other or you don't. And there is no bending or changing.</span>"

But honestly, I'm never going to feel any different- whether I'm 21, 40, or 65. Really, the significance in age lies not in that we change, but in the human tendency to organize our lives in a certain way. As much as I try to resist believing that birthday = big deal, ""happy birthday"" is a way of saying, ""I appreciate your existence."" And that's a lot of pressure- I mean, I hate expectations. But I've come around-- a birthday is, after all, like my very own holiday. So is 21 the last birthday I get to look forward to? I say, NO WAY! I'm happy to take advantage of my annual excuse to party...annually, thankyouverymuch. Because there are not enough of those in college, or anything.<br /><br />So, twenty-one. Hooray! Now I get to do...the same things I already do! Oh wait... it's ""illegal"" for persons under 21 to consume alcohol. God bless America. Then again, who am I kidding- the cheap and plentiful opportunities to break the rules with such ease and glee are gone now, never again to return. *single tear* To all those out there who have contributed to the corruption of Jessica Obsessica Jade- whether it be via alcohol, porn, fake ID, sex, drugs, rock n' roll, and all of the above-- you know who you are. To those I have the privilege of calling my honorary corruptors: I would not be the same without you. Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my...nevermind. You taught me well, and the time has come for me to bear the torch of corruption for future generations. I have a lot to live up to.<br /><br />I know it's childish to view life in phases. But a birthday is, after all, a time for reflection too. Sorry to disappoint, but my twentieth year in life doesn't even come close to my nineteenth year in terms of scandal/debauchery. But I did get to...<br />... perform a concerto with an orchestra, win a lot of money in a big competition, total my car, take a women's studies course at last, use my first fake ID, go clubbing for the first time, discover bar-hopping, take a summer trip across the Pacific to Taiwan and revisit childhood, get back in touch with bonds I thought I'd lost or never realized I had. I did fall so in love with my major and everything that came with it, buy myself presents on Valentine's day, perform Mahler 6, Shostakovich 10, and Beethoven 9, miss Brevard, attend my first UGA football game, teach piano lessons, lose my voice, accompany a soloist, tackle Beethoven op. 109, give my first degree recital, discover Franck Sonata in A and David Sedaris, get over something I was too deeply hurt about for the longest time. I did finally see what has always been in front of me, enjoy my solitude, kiss somebody special, become a better pianist and a better drinker, love being single, learn that you need your family more than you will ever know, realize that love never fails. I did get photographed like a model, procrastinate, buy a plane ticket to New Orleans for winter break, see the ASO perform Beethoven's 9th, purchase an iPod, bid on someone at a date auction, buy a lot of shoes, shop till i drop and keep going. I did love music theory, go to formal and have an amazing time, endure Medieval torture, feel lucky to have great friends, and finally understand that pain only goes down to a certain point and then it stops. I did do all that and so much more...<br /><br />I still refuse to let my age define me. I'll be just as crazy at 80, 90, 100. Because after all, life is continuous, not a series of phases, and it is like T.S. Eliot said: to make an end is to make a beginning...and after all these years of solemnly swearing that I was up to no good, I can proudly say: MISCHIEF MANAGED. So far! Because don't be fooled: the mischief doesn't end here, now or ever. And I don't know about you, but I'll drink to that.<br /><br />Legally.<br /><br />Damn it felt good to be a gangsta. God bless the ol' US of A indeed, without whose stupid law this particular birthday wouldn't be especially significant. Since it is, a certain chapter is now over. <br /><br />So here it is, friends and foes: happy twenty-first birthday to me. The ""end"" of an era. French-kiss it goodbye."

"event","Well friends and foes, another summer has come and gone, and I'm making this final post as a send- off to all the good times and bad. So long and farewell to hot summer days and even hotter summer nights; hello to work-a-holism and sleep deprivation and good, challenging intensity; goodbye to Livejournal again, or at least until my next adventure, perhaps. If you still wish to keep up with me, I'm back to posting on <strong><font size=""4""><a href=""http://www.cadential64.com"">my real blog</a></font></strong> again<font size=""4"">.</font> [yes, to view it you have to <a href=""http://alsosprachsara.com/jessicajade/wp-login.php"">log in</a>, but it's really quick and easy- I promise! So <a href=""http://alsosprachsara.com/jessicajade/wp-register.php"">do it</a>]. <strong><br /><br /></strong><em>from my paper-and-pen journal...</em><strong><br /><br /><em>Friday, July 14th 2006</em><br /><br />I. Leaving on a jet plane</strong><br />Fear of flying is an inexplicably common affliction among many otherwise normal people. I have never understood it. I, for one, have always loved flying, at least as long as I've been conscious enough to appreciate what flying means. It's a gateway to all sorts of delightful, prospective adventures. It's a philosophical affirmation to the glory of the human potential, an eroica symphony to the will of mankind, and rightfully so, for isn't it nothing less than heroic that we've managed the fusion of imagination, ambition, and intelligence to turn out this triumphant sum of hard, radiant competence? I'm writing this at an altitude of 36,000 feet, aboard a plane that has just taken off from Hartsfield International Airport in home sweet home Atlanta, headed for that glamorous, plastic, SoCal dreamworld of bottle blondes and bimbos, but titled, for some reason, as The Angles. Not for long though, for soonafter, the adventure will resume and will see me flying over the rivers and through the woods and across the great Pacific Ocean itself to that tiny, chic island, that bustling metropolis and mountainous terrain of Formosa, a name which comes from Portugese and means ""beautiful."" <br /><br />Nothing can spoil the fun of getting there, and leaving&nbsp; just now has reminded me of one of the best feelings ever in life-- the anticipation and the gathering momentum of being aboard an aircraft that is in the act of taking off. Maybe it's because I haven't flown nearly enough in this dear lifetime of mine, but the novelty has never worn off on me. It's the pure exhilaration of a rare, privileged moment when you are running with no holds on life. It's like running on a beautiful, bronze and pink-tinged beach at sunset or sunrise, running while holding a high-sailing kite, and suddenly you realize that your feet no longer touch the sand and up, up, and away you go, throwing caution and reality to the winds and laughing with pure glee and joy, shouting ""hah hah hah fly you fools! hah hah hah I'm still alive!"" Every take-off is a moment in my life when a manic lust for enthusiasm and adventure overcomes me and I just want to sing out my excitement. I think it was Bilbo Baggins who said in <em>The Hobbit, </em>""There are no safe paths in this part of the world. Remember you are over the Edge of the Wild now, and in for all sorts of fun wherever you go."" How true, and how I welcome it! Let a journey begin anew; let me meet that horizon. When the wheels of the jet begin rolling down the runway, torturously slow at first, but then faster and faster until suddenly I'm racing upward and forward and my ears are popping and I'm zooming high above the clouds in a thrilling, upward trajectory, unprotected and free from my worries that are grounded in the descending world below, a title of a collection of short stories come to mind, some Southern literature I read in IB Junior English that I didn't particularly like. But the title is so appropriate: <em>Everything that Rises Must Converge...</em>and it does; I see it right here outside the window, the wing of this Boeing 757 meeting the floating horizon, this blue and fluffy white tinged with gentle gold. <br /><br />The soundtrack to this moment, courtesy of my new iPod, was none other than the <em>Adagietto</em> from Mahler 5. Someone once told me, ""If heaven had a sound, it would sound like that."" Heaven- how appropriate. Flying isn't just getting from point A to point B, it represents this ideal of adventure and worldliness, of ambition and sophistication,<em> </em>the largeness of <em>mankind's ability to conquer all that senseless space. </em>And I never, ever want this to get old. <br /><br /><strong>II. Dance With Me<br /></strong>I'm currently watching <em>Take the Lead, </em>starring Antonio Banderas, who basically epitomizes the meaning of devastatingly sexy. I want to learn how to ballroom dance with skill and grace. It's a wish I have in life, I suppose. I've been planning (saying) to go at school for ages, but something always comes up and I just don't have time. This complimentary in-flight movie is a little cliche (hasn't this all been done before?) but at least it reaffirms what I've been saying forever, that ballroom dancing is one of the sexiest, most artful expressions possible to mankind, ""sex on hardwood"" (as a girl says in <em>Take the Lead</em>), or ""a vertical expression of a horizontal wish"" (from <em>Shall We Dance). </em>It's not really about sex, but <em>romance</em>; the elegance and the fun and the flair that it exudes. It really is romance incarnate, and it's high time that I learn how to dance beyond just the waltz. Oh, and any guy or girl who's a wicked dancer is DAMN sexy and makes me wish I had what they had, wish the impossible if only for a moment, wish that I knew how to move my body like that. Maybe one day."

"event","These are my true confessions; confessions of an ABC (American Born Chinese), although it's more like CBA (Chinese Born American), actually. haha.<span style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;""><br /><br />Disclaimer:</span> I'm not trying to make blanket statements. Two short, whirlwind weeks of vacation in Taiwan isn't nearly enough time to fully immerse yourself in its culture, and I've never lived there, so I'm naturally unable to perceive many of the nuances of the lifestyle. Having grown up in the South (Georgia of all places), my life experience isn't necessarily representative of America as a whole either. So I speak only for myself. <br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">I. On Being American</span><br />Being an American is not a race or a pedigree or a heritage, it's a consciousness. And any cultural consciousness is a set of ideas, ideals, a lifestyle, and even the many unspoken, assumed nuances that you identify with. (Eva Hoffman's <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lost in Translation</span> sheds valuable insight into this). Having been born, raised, and socialized in America, it only makes logical sense that I'm American. In recent months, I've been musing quite a bit on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">what's happened to the Asian in me?</span> Had I become just another twinkie (yellow on the outside, white on the inside)? No time like the present to have the hallmark cultural identity crisis of an ABC, I supposed (and here I was thinking I'd escaped such a typical tendency! oops). I hadn't even realized how much of myself I'd forgotten about or betrayed. It's not okay for me to be ""white-washed"" because 1)obviously I'm not white even though I'm American 2) my entire upbringing has been so steeped in Asian culture, so if I've lost that, then something must be missing...I was always the first to claim that my identity is interest/belief-based, not racially/ethnically based at all. But isn't it?<br /><br />You see, Chinese (Mandarin) is my native tongue. I didn't learn English until I was three. I went to Chinese school for nearly 10 years. I learned Chinese history and values and Chinese calligraphy and Chinese painting. I studied/participated (I used the term ""studied"" loosely because I sucked at it) Chinese dance for the same amount of time. At home, my parents cook Chinese food and I eat with chopsticks. We used to speak Chinese all the time but that's faded over the years. I grew up celebrating Chinese New Year and the Moon Festival and all that. When I was little, my parents used to read me Chinese bedtime stories. My parents' friends are Asian too and I remember spending lots of time at their houses throughout my childhood. My entire family (other than my immediate one) lives in Taiwan. I still remember the days when I used to think only in Chinese. <br /><br />I don't know why or when or how, but over the years, I gradually lost touch with my roots, to the point of near-extinction. In college, I grew even further away. Maybe it's because I'm at a school like UGA, where there are are like, five Asians on campus. And I think I've always identified more with the Western world anyway- I infinitely prefer Beethoven or Mozart opera over Chinese opera or the music of some strange, far-eastern instruments. I probably relate to Shakespeare more than I do to Chinese literature. But they say that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. As Westernized as I've become, there are many aspects of my personality that spring directly from my Asian upbringing, things I don't even realize. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">How</span> am I Chinese/Taiwanese and American? How do I be myself, all of myself? What does that even mean? I don't have the answers. I also know that I don't need to worry. But at least I can begin by asking the right questions. <br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">II. On Culture and Being the Norm</span><br />Being in Taiwan really emphasized&nbsp; the all-influencing factor of environment and how much of our characters is determined by the culture in which we live and came of age. Being accustomed to America, it felt strangely curious and somehow comforting to be in a place where I <span style=""font-style: italic;"">was</span> the norm (ethnically speaking). I think I've spent so much of my life running away from the Asian in me because I wanted to as close to the norm as possible, which is understandable. It's sociological and has to do with a societies' unequal distribution of power and bias toward what is considered the ""norm"" (in America, it's white, heterosexual, and male); at least, that's how we perceive it (it's a lot more complex but I don't want to get into that here). My parents (like all parents, I suppose) always taught me that I'm not like everyone else, but I didn't want to believe it. I wanted to fit in, and for a long time, I saw my Asian-ness as an impediment to being accepted. You know how backward and ridiculous adolescent peer pressure and insecurity can be. Anyway, my trip to Taiwan was very important to me, not only because I went to a different country but because the culture is a part of me too- I mean, meeting my very own family and seeing where my parents grew up and everything- imagine that! <br /><br />Being immersed in the culture from which I came is a refreshing reminder that my race and background is so much more than a skin color or a(n often) misrepresented caricature portrayed in the Western media. I don't know when being an Asian girl became trendy, but the whole ""Everybody loves an Asian girl!"" craze commodifies and fetishizes Asians without regards to the meaning, appreciation, and culture behind Asian heritage. Many a time, I've felt like some Caucasian men view me as one of this season's hottest, must-have accessories or something; at least, I definitely realized that being Asian is an asset that makes me ""exotic"" and therefore more desirable than the average girl. Sadly, I began to view myself that way, forgetting the responsibility I have to be in touch with my heritage and thinking that I was only Asian in my genes. <br /><br />I really hadn't given all this cultural-identity stuff much thought in recent years. The least I knew was that I would be a round peg in a square hole in Taiwan, an outsider because I am so Americanized. And boy, was I ever. Somehow they all knew, they could tell from a mile away that I'm not a native (not that I expected anything different). Maybe it's the suntan (pale is the beauty standard and girls carry parasols and wear jackets to avoid getting tan), the sunglasses (nobody ever wears them over there), flip flops (inconceivable!). People there always tried to talk to me in English first. One woman at the night market thought I was Japanese. I know that I have a different mien altogether and I am probably the most Americanized Asian person that I've ever met. I thought of what a friend told me about her recent visit to Japan- she said she felt like such an outsider (even though she was born there), but she said that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">it's okay. </span>It's okay to be American, because we grew up here. What she said has helped me a lot. I know I'll never be the norm here. I'll never really be the norm in Taiwan either. But being in-between isn't so bad. <br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">III. An Original Moment</span><br />Obviously, the origins of Taiwan's culture sprang from traditional Chinese culture (in China) centuries ago, but it has also been influenced a lot by Japan (from the occupation in the 1800's) and Western elements.&nbsp; It's a blend of original far-East meets innovative West with various other original motifs thrown in for good measure. I find it annoying when people ask me about the difference between being Chinese and Taiwanese. It's a matter of culture: I've never been to China, but I know that it's a totally different lifestyle from Taiwan. Yes, the ethnicity is the same (for the record, my maternal grandparents are from China, so I am Chinese and Taiwanese) but culturally, Taiwan is unique, and it is not like China or Japan or anywhere else. If anything, Taiwan is more like America-- it is very Western and democratic. <br /><br />The apple doesn't fall far from the tree...everybody goes back to their roots in the end. It's always like that. I hate to be predictable, but ABCs like myself will always want to get back in touch with their culture after having grown up a world apart from it. I wish I paid more attention in Chinese school. I wish I knew how to speak, read, and understand Chinese history, art, and culture better than I do now. I came of age in America, and I'll always primarily identify with American culture. I am proud to be American. But I am extremely grateful and happy that American isn't all that I am. I'm proud to be Chinese and Taiwanese too. I'll never be completely one or the other. And I'm also proud of that. <br /><br />It's both a blessing and a difficulty, growing up with two cultures.&nbsp; Does one conflict with the other? By being one, am I sacrificing or marginalizing some of the other? How do I reconcile the two? Maybe you get to be the best of both worlds. The following are some of the reasons I love Taiwan:<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">A. It's a practical, efficient, fast-paced world.</span><br />I'm thinking particularly of Taipei city. Like Taiwan itself, it ranges from the crowded and dirty to the austerely beautiful in that steel-gray NYC kind of way. There's a real vibrancy and creative energy buzzing about that makes it such a hip, fun place to be.&nbsp; Everybody minds their own business and is always in a hurry, but nothing like the stressed, anxious anonymity often criticized about big cities. I'd describe Taiwan as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">amiably brisk</span>. It's more friendly and there doesn't seem to be a pervasive sense of one-upmanship like in America. <br />Anything goes and nobody really judges you (or has time to). I ride motorcycles in a miniskirts and it's no big deal. Traffic is intensely insane. The ubiquitous motor scooters are, at any moment, passing or circumventing cars and busses from all directions: horizontal, vertical, diagonal, you name it. They are not cars and they know it. Cars are equally crazy. The streets are so crazy that you often have to pass over double-yellows. Head-on collisions are narrowly avoided but no one seems to find that a big deal. I tried waiting for a few motorcycles to pass before crossing the street once and they probably thought I was a novelty- <span style=""font-style: italic;"">what?! a pedestrian yielding to a motorcycle? </span>It's a very aggressive world out there. American drivers would NOT be able to drive on the streets of Taiwan. I would never dare attempt to. The cross-walks are very strictly followed (unlike in NYC) but only so you don't die. The cool thing is that when you're allowed to walk, there is a timer (accompanied by a cute, digital, cartoon-like walking figure) counting down the seconds until it changes to red again. When it gets to six seconds, the digital, cartoon-like walking figure begins to run. It's cute. And honking is a friendly way of saying ""I'm here, just letting you know so you don't back into me or something"" It's not rude at all, just very practical. And drivers will always honk at you if you're in the way. Always. There is a convenience store (or two, or three) on every corner, mainly 7-11, FamilyMart, or Hi-Life. You sweat. A LOT. You learn not to be concerned with how you look because at the end of the day, your clothes will be drenched in sweat. The sun rises at 5 am, which can be quite unnerving. I find it hard to sleep past 8 am for some reason. Chocolate does not exist on the island. Neither does cheese, I think. haha. Solicitors are very aggressive, everywhere from the night market to the Chanel boutiques. They always approach/talk to you directly and their overbearingness makes me feel guilty for just looking (even at Chanel and Gucci- telling me about their great sales as if I can afford this stuff or something! haha). I learned that you don't need air conditioning to live, and after experiencing summer in Taiwan, I will never complain about hot, humid weather ever again. Valentine's Day is a three day affair, beginning on July 7th, 7/7 according to the Lunar calendar. As if living through February 14th on an annual basis weren't bad enough, I got to quadruple the fun and experience a total of four Vdays in 2006. This would be horrid, except that nobody in Taiwan really gives flip about Valentine's. (See? America, you have a lot to learn). I also quite like Taiwanese MTV. It's always the first thing my sister and I love to watch when we turn on the television. It is so cute and just fun. <br /><br />The Taiwanese are not obsessed with appearances. Typical apartments/housing don't try to be aesthetically pleasing and often look quite stained and dilapidated, but don't be fooled. Taiwan is very unromantic (at least to me) and unpretentious. I still see Taipei as a beautiful city. It's not like Europe with an air of sophistication, sentimentality, and all its grand, breath-taking, old-world beauty. It's not covered in sweeping sky-scrapers like glamorous New York (aside from Midtown and a few other swanky places). But the uniqueness is reflected in every gesture and not to be overlooked or underestimated. <br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">B. Food<br />...</span>is something to be enjoyed and delighted in. In Taiwan, you eat whatever you want, whenever you want it. It's plentiful, tasty, convenient, and cheap. I hardly ever had time to get hungry because food was always available and consumption always encouraged. Food is a sign of welcome. Whenever you visit someone's house, they always bring out a fruit plate (I will miss the abundance of yummy tropical fruits (especially guava and mango!) all over the place!) or other tasty Chinese snacks. It's also a sign of community and sharing. If you don't eat, you're being anti-social. Eating with friends at the night market and family dinners are pleasant. In America, food is connected with the obesity epidemic and is ""the enemy."" Eating issues are hard to imagine in Taiwan. Realize once and for all that if you just eat what you want when you want it, it never amounts to very much. It's deprivation that causes obsession and overeating. I definitely ate more over there than I did in a month at home, and I actually lost weight (eh,&nbsp; I'll probably gain it back from being in America. hah). My metabolism is still in Taiwan mode right now- shot through the roof, and I barely weigh a little over 100 lbs now... and there's absolutely nothing unhealthy or wrong with that. <br /><br />This got me thinking...as far as I know, eating disorders are an American set of problems. In my American History class in college, I once read that perverse, dysfunctional behaviors represent the core anxieties about a particular civilization and its ideals, a contradiction revealing how those ideals are falsely encouraged and do not work. Case in point: America, starvation in the land of plenty, where people willingly make themselves sick to achieve a beauty standard. My Taiwanese friend Cat says that people in Taiwan are still obsessed with losing weight. Sure, you have your usual<span style=""font-style: italic;""> lose weight by sleeping!</span> commercials. But the way that the Taiwanese interact with food is completely different. There is no obsession or guilt associated with it. And for heaven's sake, the way Americans overanalyze and break down food is perverse and disgusting (counting calories, fad diets, and all that bullshit. JUST. STOP. it's ridiculous). Dieting and deliberate exercise seem pretty nonexistent on the island (except for boys, maybe- my sister said that all the boys at her camp were worried they'd lose weight so they wanted to go work out at California Fitness, haha) and as a result, generally everyone is trim and stylish. Walking everywhere is not only required, but a built-in part of the lifestyle. I noticed how in America, the tendency toward obesity may be tied to socioeconomics. Poorer people can't afford gym memberships and live in more dangerous neighborhoods where walking outdoors can be dangerous. Access to organic, healthy food is difficult; it's much easier to feed yourself for 99 cents at McD's than to buy a $6 sandwich. That's not the case in Taiwan, where the lifestyle seems so much inherently more active and healthy. Tasty food is still cheap, accessible, and not so fattening or oversweetened (I love the muted sweetness of Chinese desserts!), and where the hell did Americans develop such a penchant for high-cholesterol junk food anyway? Obesity is extremely rare. As someone who had an eating disorder at the age of 18 for almost a year (and knowing how common eating disorders are), I can testify that it's a psychological problem and a question of attitude. 60 something percent obesity rate in America? The prevalance of eating disorders? There's no denying that it's caused in part by the way food is treated on a macro level. <br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">C. Fashion</span><br />Bottom line: America needs to be more like Taiwan in fashion. My friend Cat says Americans are more practical and that Taiwanese girls try to be too cute. I disagree and prefer the Taiwanese way. Many American college students are too sloppy and scruffy. If you know me, you know that I love to dress up and would never be caught dead going to class in my pajamas. In Taiwan, slide heels are what flip flops are to America. Flip-flops are too much like house slippers and therefore not appropriate to wear in public over there. Yes, some of the clothes in Taiwan can be weird or tacky or frilly and cross-decade/generational but everything is very unique. No two people really dress alike, even if there is a definite leitmotif in the way people dress. Like I said before, the variations are truly endless. It's not the high- fashion- runway look of Europeans, but a chic, trendy fun quality that manages to be low-maintenance. Taiwanese girls don't try too hard. In my particular college town, many girls will spend hours getting ready for a night out on the town only to emerge in ill-fitting clothes and globs of clownish makeup and look generally low-class, tacky, or sloppy. The nightlife in Taiwan is much more aesthetically pleasing and cutting-edge. Oh, and Burberry and Gucci are extremely popular on the island. I see it everywhere I go, real or fake (haha). <br /><br />I learned a lot about fashion while I was there. The cool thing I learned is that you defintiely do not have to spend a lot of money to look stylish (hello, night market!). It's not about having expensive clothes. People don't judge you by what freaking brand your clothes are or by what kind of car you drive (like I said, Taiwan is unpretentious). Taiwan is all about chic, low-maintenance cuteness. Dressing well is about being creative, having an eye for combining things that make winning combinations, and making otherwise normal, perfunctory things look good. Even the ubiquitous Polo shirt can look stylish if you wear it/accessorize it right. Even if you wear what other people wear, you don't have to look like carbon copies (some people at UGA don't seem to understand that yet). After spending a couple weeks there, I have so many more ideas about how to dress (not to mention awesome outfits!). Unfortunately, Athens is not the place, and I fear that I'd only feel ridiculous showing up to class in cute shoes and sun dresses and such. So you probably won't notice a difference in me, hah. I know that they're wrong and I'm right-- frumpiness should not be acceptable and people SHOULD be fashionable on a daily basis! Casual can still be chic. As it is though, I'm in America not Taiwan (where you can dress down or dress up anytime and nobody will think less of you or bat an eye) and I don't want to dress inappropriately for any given occasion. Like I said, America needs to be more like Taiwan in fashion. <br /><br />Everybody has stylish hair too. Yes, even the boys. And the clothes come in much better sizes. Clothes fit me so well there and I love it.<br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">D. Family<br /></span>I never knew much about my family. I know a little more now: on my mother's side, my ancestors came from China. My great grandfather was a military doctor and the family moved to Taiwan during the 1940s, during the China Civil War, with the exclusion of my grandmother's older sister, i think. My father's side has been in Taiwan a lot longer and lived under the Japanese rule in the 1800s. There's a lot more, but I don't really know. My father grew up in a small town and my mother grew up in a big city. They met in the States and got married here. Then I came along four years later. I used to say that America is the only home I've ever had, that I've never had any place else to miss. That's not completely true anymore. There is a special kind of love and bond that you have only with your family members, something that no one else can share in or understand. I can't describe it in words, really, but I know it's something I'd never, ever had before, which is why I'm only realizing it now. I identify my with my mother's side of the family more than my father's side (mainly because the latter is mostly older than me and further ahead in life. For some reason, although I appreciate their kindness and friendliness, I can't relate to them that well). It's amusing how it turned out: my maternal grandparents had four daughters, who each proceeded to have daughters of their own, which results in our family being almost all girls. Out of all my cousins, only two are male and they are, as my sister says, the ""anomalies."" It's different for most people than it is for me, being with family, because with mine there's a language/culture difference. A huge one. At first, I thought we'd never relate to each other- I grew up a world away from them; I can't really talk to them about what motivates me, what I'm passionate about, the literature or music that's changed my life, or my opinions on U.S. politics. And I'm so conversation-based, so it's impossible to know me otherwise. But my family dynamic is something really special, and I realized that you don't always have to have intense conversations, you can just be in each others' presence and it's a lot of fun and funniness. <br /><br />Before, I didn't know what I was missing. Now I'm acutely aware, and it's sad somehow. I wish we hadn't waited 11 years to come to Taiwan again. I wish that there isn't an entire ocean separating us, that they'd been a regular part of my life all along <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Goodbye, goodbye, when will I be back?</span> My grandfather says that he hopes he will live long enough to see my complete my doctoral degree and become Dr. Jessica Jade Tsai. I remember how adorable my formerly-baby cousin was when she was 3, the last time I saw her. She's 14 now, and it's incredible to see people so much more grown up and knowing that you weren't there. The cousins from Taipei are so cute and zen and well brought up.&nbsp; Debbie (the one who is learning English) is fascinated with American culture- she has many misconceptions of it because she's only seen what they portray in movies. She says she wants to go to a house party (to which I say, if you're in Taiwan, why party at someone's house when you can do it at the club?!) and wants a boyfriend, to which my sister and I promptly responded, no you absolutely don't, it's <span style=""font-style: italic;"">tai</span> <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ma fan</span> (however you spell it in pinyin). hahaha. My youngest cousin is the most adorable little four year old boy. Since he's the only son, his father's side of the family spoils him. He's missing his two front baby teeth, is already very intelligent, and likes to sing K-TV songs in both English and Chinese. He always loses in the ""seaweed game"" but does it so adorably. When I next see him, will he have morphed into a handsome young boy, too? Youth seems so fleeting and the years go by in a flash. <br /><br />If only I had more time and more money...but my mom says that if I saw them often, the wouldn't treat me like a guest anymore and spoil me; they'd treat me ""like family."" haha. Still, I don't want it to be another 11 years before I see them again. <br /><br />After spending time with both sides of my family, I definitely, completely realize that when you marry someone, you really are marrying their whole family. So you better get to know them and make sure you get along. It's kind of a scary thought. One day, I'll have a husband and I'll have to integrate myself into his family too. And he into my family. I pondered this, and knew with certainty that one day, I shall bring my future husband (or fiance) to Taiwan to meet my extended family. I can picture it already- he'd be so out of place, tired, and confused, but I'll look into his eyes and see that he doesn't mind, because he will love me, all of me. I know that I don't have to and it'd be so easy not to, but the thing is, I really want to. Because there really is more to me than what you see on American soil, you know. I laugh and think of how awkward it will be, especially if I marry someone Caucasian, which is very likely based on my track record (haha). Obviously, I am years away from considering marriage (frankly, it freaks me out that my same-age peers are already planning to get married/engaged!) but this all feels so circle-of-life-esque. It's hilarious to picture the future in which my sister and I will be the weird aunts (yes G, you are still weird, albeit never as weird as I am) and our kids will talk about us and my grandmother and my aunts will sit around talking about us like they did before. Family, family, family. What a strange, quirky thing. And what about my own future family? Will they be bilingual too? How could that be possible? How do I keep up with being bi-cultural, and how long will it last? I can't possibly predict that yet, but I'm sure the answers will come as my future comes into fruition.<br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><br /><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">IV. Conclusions</span><br />This trip has re-affirmed why I believe traveling is so important: it gets you out of ruts you didn't realize you were stuck in, forces you to see that the problems you thought were so universal and stressful are either non-existent or are treated differently in other cultures. I should make a point to leave the country once a year or something (if I had money, that is- haha) because it's important to never get too caught up in the present, to realize that you have a past, to get a bigger picture for the future, to realize that there is a great, big, beautiful world out there that is so much more than here-and-now. Not all those who wander are lost, and it's important to wander. It's not just about the places you go, it's <span style=""font-style: italic;"">how</span> you experience them. I haven't seen enough of the world and I will. And I'll make the most of it, all of it.<br /><br />I can't tell you how many times I longed for America the beautiful while I was away. America is my home because I came of age here and have, since birth, been assimilated into the American cultural consciousness. For the most part, I will always be out-of-place in Taiwan because of how Westernized I am. Over here, people find me exotic because I'm Asian. Over there, people find me exotic because I'm American. I can't say I really felt at home there, but in a way I did, in a different sense of ""home"" that I can't quite put into words. But I'm no longer trying to ""fit in"" in any given place anymore. I'll always be in-between. I understand that my environment is primarily responsible for how I came to be who I am today, and that had I grown up in Taiwan, I'd have completely different attitudes, experiences, and taste in men. I might not have liked growing up there, with the intense, mericratic culture (and all the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">buxiban</span>, aka ""make-up class"" craze) and academics. Test scores are EVERYTHING and we all know how much I, Miss I-Will-Never-Tell-My-SAT-Scores-Because-That's-Completely-Irrelevant would LOVE that! haha (hey, it's a matter of principle on my part, just so you know). I'm grateful to have grown up in America and I'm happy to have become who I am today. In many ways, I do feel that Taiwan is ""vastly superior to America"" (okay Paul, minus the flashing peace signs, hah). At least culturally speaking, it is. I mean, in America, kids grow up believing in the tooth-fairy, Santa Claus, and soul mates and all that shit...none of which are fantasies I really buy into. Over there, girls wouldn't dream of getting married right after college or anything (like I said, it freaks me out that my some of own peers are already jumping into this kind of thing). It's not overly sentimental like Europe/America. Everyone valued primarily for their brains and competence, which is just more logical. People don't seem to get attached to other people/places/things as much, I don't think. Or who knows; I didn't grow up there, remember? But I think Taiwan is where I get my independent, sassy spirit (although I'm embarassingly maudlin and naive as well, but we'll keep that a secret), my fast-paced personality, my intolerance for people who walk too slow or talk too slow, my love of being in big cities, etc. I get the big-city aspect of my personality from my mother, who grew up in a big city. I still don't know what I got from my father, at least I can't discern yet, haha. And there must be a lot more Chinese/Taiwanese in me than I can discern, many things I don't realize. But those aspects are present within me, all the time. Actually, it's not about me, but about something much greater than myself: family. Understanding that I have roots, a heritage...maybe it's something that other people have always taken for granted, but somehow it makes all the difference in the world to me. And the difference now is that I want to know, to be a part of it.<br /><br />I'm still much more out-of-touch with my heritage than I should be, and realistic truth is that I probably will never know as much as I should about it. I can't read worth crap. I do not have an eloquent command of the Chinese language, even though I'm still mostly fluent. I'd like to improve that, gradually, somehow. Somebody speak Chinese to me, please! haha. I'm considering doing the Loveboat camp that my sister did during the summer after my college graduation because I really want to learn about this wonderful place where I came from. The answers will come as the years go on, but I'm not going to worry about it. I'm glad we took this trip so that I can at least begin to understand. I have a bit more agency now (agency meaning the ability to act within a structure; in this case the structure is my bi-culturalism...yay for what I learned in Women's Studies! haha). Like Alice of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Alice in Wonderland</span>, I want to ask: ""Who in the world am I?' Ah, that's the great puzzle!"" <br /><br />Going to Taiwan, seeing where my family came from, and coming back again has also made me appreciate America more. It has also urged me to visit other countries and see other cultures. Most of all, it's made me very happy to be exactly who I am and has given me the confidence to not run away from any part of myself anymore. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Who in the world am I?</span> Well, I'm a classical musical lover/aspiring musician, a literature lover who tries too hard to read between the lines and thinks too much and overanalyzes, the Ayn Rand enthusiast, the feminist, the irresponsible one who procrastinates way too much, the one who feels things too deeply, the solitary, anti-social one who is more likely to be found in a practice room on Saturday night, the rebel with too many causes who used to skip class in high school to take walks in the park or around the Forum, who left h.s. orchestra rehearsals to ""make up a test"" at Wendy's, the gym neurotic who swims laps before her morning classes, the excited little girl who jumped and pointed with delight at ""choo-choo trains!"" from her grandmother's balcony in Taiwan when she was four years old (or so the relatives tell me),&nbsp; the 17-year-old who performed Beethoven Concerto No. 3 with an orchestra and still hasn't played that well since, the child who used to practice her Chinese calligraphy with her grandfather when she was little, the girl who went to GHP once upon a time and Brevard last year and loved those two summers, the deluded wannabe who played Beethoven op. 109 for her sophomore recital, whose best experiences in life were playing second violin Mahler 6 and Beethoven 9, the fashion-savvy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Vogue</span> reader, the sentimental softie who listens to Hey Jude when she's sad, the wild child that loves to party (heh heh)...but you know, whoever I am, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree...I wasn't made in a vacuum.<br /><br />It has definitely been a good 20 + years. I realized that there are many aspects to me, and I just&nbsp; have to be myself, whatever combination that entails. And I'm more than my career, my hobbies, my race, my culture. I'm not worried about figuring stuff out as much anymore. Don't sweat the small stuff, and it's all small stuff, right? Things tend to take care of themselves, because that's what things do. All I know is that I'll never be able to view the world or myself in quite the same way ever again, and that's something I did not expect from being away so short a time. I learned that I am so loved, that I am not alone, and most of all, that it's not only okay, but <span style=""font-style: italic;"">great</span>- to be different. And I'm glad.<br /><br />I'm nostalgic. Or is it grass is greener syndrome? I miss all the unique aspects of Taiwan: the night market, the MRT, good food, going to the hair salon to get my hair washed, fresh tropical fruit, eating ice dessert, crazy traffic, walking miles and miles everyday, 7-11, Midtown, waking up to the sunlight streaming through the windows of the third-floor bedroom at my grandmother's house in the morning and the way the curtain billowed out from the screen door in the breeze (or the fan). I miss my aunts and uncles and cousins. I want to go back and don't know when I will next be able to. I've been pondering how people say ""bye"" across the globe, and as far as I know, only in English does it have such a monochromatic weight of finality, carrying no more open possibilities. Everywhere else, there are other direct connotations: the French and Spanish say ""to God"" (adieu and adios). But then I noticed that English there is ""godspeed"" and also ""farewell."" And even ""bye"" is usually ""goodbye."" So whenever we part, we bestow well wishes upon those we part with; we send them a blessing and positive vibe that is nearly inherent in our concept of leaving. Interesting how much our language can reveal, isn't it? I think I prefer the Chinese way most of all: <span style=""font-style: italic;"">zai jian</span> (is that the correct pinyin? eh). Goodbye is never the end, so zai jian to the island known as Beautiful (according to the Portugese). We will meet again, and hopefully in sooner than a long decade.<br /><br />It's good to be home. I feel like everything unexpectedly fell into place this summer, and it's a strange, curious kind of wonderful."

<div align=""left"">Haha. I like, I like. The last bit is not true, though, because the rich CEO might very well be an unscrupulous asshole. I dated a business major once; I would know. hah. Anyway.<br /><br />One of my guilty pleasures is the <em>E!</em> Channel. Watching the Top 10 Hottest Celebrities countdown yesterday, I couldn't help but chuckle when they'd praise the beauty of a celebrity and proceed to show airbrushed glamour shots or screen shots from a movie of said celebrity. <em>Don't they know how those photos/videos are put together?</em> I laugh. <br /><br />For seven hours of my life, I have been a model. I took studio pictures in Taiwan, and it was mind-blowingly amazing. Literally all of the pictures they take look like they're ripped from <em>Vogue </em>or <em>Harper's Bazaar</em>, they have professional hair and makeup stylists, professional photographers, genuine model-like poses and sets, and everything. Seeing how all the different themes and styles were put together was an invaluable learning experience for me in this media-saturated, image-obsessed world. There's a reason why fashion magazines make you feel ugly. Let me say this once and for all: comparing yourself to celebrities and models (or shall i say, their images) and trying to look more like them is a Sisyphian endeavor indeed. It's ludicrous (not to state the obvious). I mean, you're taking already exceptionally-beautiful people, putting on layers and layers of face-lifting, highlighting makeup on them, photographing them from their best angles, and then re-touching/airbrushing those photos. Not to mention how many shots it took (you will not believe how many photos get discarded) to get that one pose you see in the <em>Vogue </em>fashion spread. As an avid fan and observer of high-fashion runways and glossy photos, my first-hand experience seeing how far removed the billboard images are from reality was intriguing. <br /><br />I can also testify that being a model is not a difficult job. Wear pretty clothes. Sit in the makeup chair for two hours. Proceed to do whatever the photographer wants you to do. Lather, rinse, repeat. This is not rocket science. It's just a simple matter of following directions...and endurance. Hey, I wouldn't mind getting paid to do this. It would pay for school, you know. Oh yes, it gets exhausting, more than you would know. I wanted to curl up and a corner and drop dead from exhaustion at the end. You can't eat while it's going on either. But it certainly doesn't require brainpower; therefore, it can never really qualify as difficult by my standards. Playing a Beethoven sonata is infinitely harder, believe me. <br /><br />The point is, in professional photos, you are the photographer's (and the makeup artist's, and the hairstylist's) creation. You are not really yourself. You are&nbsp; <em>their </em>product. It is undeniably ART. It's as highly stylized as any water-color or oil-painting. It's like science. And the good artists have to know what reality translates into on film. The makeup and clothes and the poses are all planned down to every single minute detail: the placement of a hand, the curl of a finger, the way the dress falls, the sweep of the hair, the exact location of a glance. It doesn't work in real-life (posing for professional photos is completely different than smiling for pictures in real life!), but one must always keep in mind that art does not imitate life, it idealizes it.&nbsp; Models and celebrities don't just look good in their photos for no reason.<br /><br />Anyway, my experience of being photographed (I use the passive voice on purpose here) was some of the most fun I've ever had with my clothes on (half-kidding. don't take what I say too literally sometimes!). A good photographer really knows how to pose his models, knows what works on film and doesn't just deal with the lighting and angles and stuff. My photographer was a genius. He knew exactly what worked for me and instructed me rapidly (entirely in Chinese!) and was always rapidly grabbing, moving around, and re-adjusting the many flashes. He used the air vent/fan in several ""windblown"" shots too, a la trademark <a href=""http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/pic/PF_NEW%5C09_14_2005_A/PF_1233060~Marilyn-Monroe-Posters.jpg"">Marilyn Monroe</a>, haha. He was also really friendly and not intimidating at all. He basically loved me because he said I'm photogenic and took over 300 pictures of me (they usually only take 150 proofs). He was probably hoping I'd buy a lot more, but alas!, i only purchased 41 (sadness). He did an amazing job. And let's not forget my stylist! Her talent is absolutely stunning. Being a good stylist is definitely an art too. With every new outfit, you are essentially creating a new sculpture. You have to be endlessly creative, quick on your feet, and innovative. She just had such an eye for how to accessorize and make me up to create a whole image/character with the outfit and pose called for. And you will not believe how much and how meticulous the makeup process is. It takes a <em>very</em> long time (ie- at least an hour to prep for my headshot, even though that was the simplest, most natural look of all!). Even in photos where people don't look like they have on much makeup- believe me; makeup for professional shoots is totally different than you'd expect. I think I'm armed with greater skill now on how to apply makeup for special occassions. Like I said, I learned a lot! Oh yes, and I think my favorite part of the photo shoot was the prepping process- I absolutely loved sitting in the makeup chair and getting dolled up and loved the fun of seeing something come together as she created a new look every time. They all said that I look like some Hong Kong movie star (I forget who)~ awww! I'm flattered.<br /><br />I got to have five different themes. I wanted these five outfits/poses to represent me, and my theme, which I'd predetermined, was to be urban sexy, romantic, and sophisticated. You know how much I love classy, romantic, and cutting-edge sexy! They had so much cute, funky, and vintage-y stuff but I couldn't, not even for dress-up, because it just isn't <em>me. </em>For the ""me"" I wanted to create, I also had to include fantasy, show a side of me that people would never see in real life. No, no bikini on the beach shots (although they had the beach and everything); because that's kind of lame, and besides I promised my friend and photographer Adam that he has exclusive rights to the shoot if I ever decide to go the <em>Maxim</em> route (hahaha I'm kidding). This is what I finally chose:<br /><br /><strong>1) the headshot</strong> (standard). I can use this for my recital/competitions whenever they need a photo of me. I wore a white drape, and he shot his one first, in the clear, morning sunshine. Very fresh and innocent.<br /><strong>2) the springtime romantic.</strong>&nbsp; I wore a long, light-green, sequined evening gown. These photos turned out the best- it was kind of like my favorite painting <em><a href=""http://www.tamsquare.net/pictures/F/Alexandre-Evariste-Fragonard-The-Bolt-Le-Verrou-.jpg"">The Bolt </a>(</em>the scarlet-draped bed and the mirror were so classy and romantic!) meets Drew Barrymore's photo spread in the June 2005 issue of <em>Vogue. </em><br /><strong>3) the fantasy: clubbing/disco/'70s-meets-'80s girl.</strong> I didn't expect the look to evolve into that, but the pictures turned out well. I wore short shorts (okay, so shorts can still be trendy! haha) and boots. My stylist gave me big hair (but it doesn't look weird!) and I really look like I came out of a '70s disco ball or something. Definitely the most fun pose of all.<br /><strong>4) traditional Chinese chi-pao.</strong> I chose a white/gold one, like what Cho Chang <a href=""http://i.mugglenet.com/gof/posterbook/choyuleball.jpg"">wore</a> to the Yule Ball in the <em>Harry Potter IV </em>movie. Except that mine was short-sleeved. Either way, it was very classic and classy! I've always loved the chi-pao. <br /><strong>5) urban sexy. </strong>I nick-named this one the ""Gucci"" look. Black suit with a sparkly silver-sequined strapless bra. My stylist gave me a very dark, dramatic look (smoky eyes!)&nbsp; for this one and very chic hair! Actually, <em>this </em>one was probably my favorite. It's got such an edge, just like me. <br /><br />It was all so much fun! I was like, ohh, even I can be pretty too! It was kind of like Glamour Shots, but infiintely better. And nothing like those cheesy studios that take your senior pictures and stuff. No way; this is much more sophisticated. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to rest or remove my makeup afterward, because my parents and I hopped into a cab and raced across town to have dinner at the <a href=""http://www.worldhotels.com/taiwan/taipei/hotel_tpehow.html"">Howard Plaza Hotel</a> with some of my dad's old coworkers/friends. It was so nice!~ they rented a private party room and we had a 10 (i think? i lost count after so many) course dinner. After the 4th or 5th course I was about to fall asleep on my chilled plate or something. I must have looked ridiculous in my studio makeup too, haha. But the Plaza Hotel is amazingly beautiful and the dinner was so good~ I love Chinese banquets (this is why Chinese weddings are so great too. heh heh). And I bought a blue Russian Doll at the gift shop. All in all, a very good day. Photo-shoots are so exhausting.<br /><br />If you're ever in China or Taiwan or Japan, go get studio portraits taken. Yes, it's expensive (still cheaper than the U.S.), but so worthwhile! It's pretty much part of the quintessential overseas visitor experience anyway. They treat you like royalty and make you look so good. I was sad that i couldn't keep some of the pics; they're the best pics of me that will ever be taken and I will never look that good again or in real life (it took over 3 hours to choose!). I am so pleased with how good a job the studio did! The package I got is very nice, and I won't actually get mine until they're finished and my aunt air-mails them along with our family portraits (can't wait to get them!). In addition to the CD of my photos, they print and bind them into both a large and a small denim-bound book (I saw my sister's; they are so nice!), make a big, glossy poster of me (haha I almost look like a bride on mine...ahh!), and I also get a key-chain and a framed photo. I can't wait to show them to you guys!<br /><br />I suppose that the next time I take studio pics will be for my wedding portraits one day (yeah, pretty scary thought I know). It's not all vanity, though (even if yes, I am a very very vain person; just look at this post! haha). I really think that everyone should have a photo shoot for the learning experience. I know that I will never view magazines, TV, or movies the same way ever again. <br /></div>

"event","I am at an internet cafe and every single person- i kid you not- is GAMING. omg&nbsp;could this BE any more ASIAN? hahaha.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm in Southern Taiwan now- staying at my grandparents' house in Taichung. Very nice- 3 stories, more bedrooms than I can keep track of, and various pictures of my family throughout the ages. Speaking of family, it's been intriguing and entertaining to meet mine, as I have grown up with nobody but my parents and my sister and often forget that I have this whole, sprawling family tree on this side of the Pacific. I laugh a lot here- it's impossible to explain in English (or secondhand) why my family is so entertaining, but believe me. Now I know where I got some of my craziness/unintentional humor from. My grandmother is the greatest cook in the world and still remembers what I love to eat (she lived with us for several years during my childhood). The past couple of days, relatives have been appearing left and right, and the whole experience is somewhat fragmented as I haven't seen these people for at least 11 years. An odd sort of familiarity pervades the experience, and I keep remembering bits and piece of my childhood years, and it all makes me very happy.&nbsp;Oh yes, and my great uncle is perhaps my favorite family member. He drives an SUV (in Taiwan! for crying out loud) and is quite a character. A true comedian&nbsp;by nature&nbsp;if I ever met one. Extremely young; I'd think he were my uncle, not great uncle, if i didn't know better. There's a picture of my great grandfather at his apt- it cracks me up because he has such a chill expression on his face mixed with a comical Mona-Lisa esque ""wtf"" expression. Visited my great-grandmother yesterday- she is 96. All I can say is that I hope I don't live that long...oh yeah, and my second aunt (my mom's younger sister) is like a more chill version of my mom. My sis and I have determined that when we grow up, I will be like my mom (the neurotic one) and my sis will be like the aunt. I saw a wedding pic of my parents from years ago. My mom is really pretty but we can already detect a hint of craziness from her expression in that pic. Yep. that's my familia. <br /><br />The record stores here are amazing- I spent a long while browsing one in Taichung yesterday and it was seriously an orgasmic experience. Sensory overload- I want this! and this! and this!...I couldn't figure out how it was organized (all in Chinese), but they had pretty much EVERYTHING. Box set of Mozart operas (44 discs) *drool* I LOVE Mozart operas more than anything, I think...The Ring Cycle (I thought of Paul and his ""Ring Cycle Party""- nerd, haha), and every imagineable soundtrack/Broadway show ever. Not to mention the usual types of music I could ever hope to find. Not bootleg, sorry- so I couldn't really afford everything I wanted. In the end, I bought just one thing: the 30th anniversary Collector's Edition of <em>The Sound of Music. </em>Listened to it and almost wept- that musical CHANGED MY LIFE, no joke. Actually, it really had a huge part in how I came to be who I am today. I watched it repeatedly and religiously as a kid-- How do you think I have perfect pitch? None other than the Do Re Mi song, of course! There is something so sweeping and heroic and romantic and sad about it all- maybe it's the beauty of the Austrian Alps, and I know that next summer I am going to&nbsp;visit Austria (I swear I will)..THE HILLS ARE ALIVE!!!&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway,&nbsp;&nbsp;we finally ate ice for the first time in a few days (I was in withdrawal)...for those of you who don't know- eating Ice is a very common and anticipated desert here in Taiwan. It's virtually an ""ice sundae"" with fruit and whatever you want toppings on top of shaved ice with ""syrup"" (dunno what else to call it) poured on top. Kind of like bubble tea but in edible form. Tastes like heaven. Food here is so much inherently healthier. Tonight we're going to hit up another Night Market- yay! Oh yeah, and yesterday one of my aunts bought me a pair of shoes- so cute! Six pairs and counting...did I mention that I did indeed get the perfect little black dress? and it is PERFECT and one of a kind. Satin and unique and I had it altered to perfection. Found it in a little boutique next to the photo studio. I've been searching for the perfect one for ages and I finally found it. And it is better than yours, so be jealous...hehe.&nbsp;<br /><br />My cousins are here and they're learning English. They are pretty cool. Some of the cousins on my dad's side already have kids. The babies are SO CUTE! Does that make them my nieces/nephews or second cousins? I have no idea how these names work. Oh yeah- and in Chinese, we have so many differentiations for different cousins/aunts/uncles. In English, you call all your aunts ""aunts"" and stuff, but in Chinese, depending on who is older, and what side of the family the person is from, you call each person something different. It can get terribly confusing and a little awkward at first when you don't know what to call the person. haha.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind of like how Eskimos have 26 different words for snow. I don't know why there are so many familial nuances. It is interesting...<br /><br />I am flying home Saturday night. It will take approx 24 hours to get back to Atl, and you know, I'm actually ready to go home.&nbsp; Atl is 12 hours behind Taiwan, so I actually have more time than I think. The moment I get home, I have to gather up all my stuff, drive to Athens, get those orchestra excerpts, break out my violin which I haven't touched in months, play piano again...AHHH. Home is where the heart is, and, you know- I miss the comforts of home...this has been a really great trip though.&nbsp;<br /><br />I miss Taipei. Definitely one of my favorite cities ever.<br /><br />Btw, boys of Georgia Tech- watch out. My sister has gotten like, really hot over the summer. Almost didn't recognize her when we were reunited. That's what 6 weeks in Taiwan will do to you. She has also become quite the heartbreaker (with heartbreak-ees from Houston to Austria to Taipei to...who knows)...great skill to learn right before college! that's my girl."

"event","some catch-up...<br /><br /><strong>Friday 7.21.06<br /></strong>I must have walked about a million and one miles today. We spent most of the day at Hot Spring Ranch, aka Chao Feng Ranch and Resort, located in the little town of Fenglin. Basically did everything except the resort and hot spring part (you have to stay overnight for that) and wow~ the place is pretty darn amazing and versatile. Don't let the country connotations of ""ranch"" fool you into a false sense of simplicity. It's anything but! Acres and acres of everything from fruit gardens with pickable fruit, some medicinal herbs, plant nurseries, cows (haha), a virtual zoo of sorts- camels, llamas, ostriches (fascinating weird creatures they are), lots of birds...the parrot was hilarious! It talked in Chinese and said ""I can talk."" (trust me, it sounds hilarious in Chinese). I've always wanted a parrot so that I can teach it to say ""fuck you""- which would be fucking hilarious.&nbsp;<br /><br />The entrance to this Ranch just shouts <font color=""#ff0000"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Mirabella</font> Gardens in Vienna- a place I still have yet to visit but soon will (next summer if all goes well!). There was a cow ranch where they milked the cows and everything, and the coolest part was seeing this little baby goat running around free to hang out among the cattle. Just totally random; who knows why/where it came from. And then I saw another baby goat that looked like a calf! It was terribly confusing! I thought it was the most adorable thing in the world- I've always been fascinated with miniature versions of normal sized things (hence my endless, child-like fascination with Russian dolls- which, btw, I finally bought for myself the other day, yay!) and this baby goat was certainly no exception. I petted it and even picked it up as though it were a puppy and took a picture with it. It is SO cute! Looks awkward in the pic because unlike dogs, goats have really long legs- it's weird; you'll see. Mini-goats are so adorable. It didn't very much like being picked up because it ran like hell away from me when I put it down, bleating (wait, sheep bleat, not goats, but whatever!) frantically for good measure.<br /><br />The architecture of this place was nearly kaleidoscopic in its diversity. Aside from the Mirabella Garden-esque scene at the entrance, the very front if the entire ranch looks like a replica of l'arc de triumph (sp?) in Paris. And nearby, there is what looks like a miniature Washington Monument (don't like it much; that thing is just too overt a phallic symbol). There were brooks, Japanese-style gardens and pavilions, LOTUS ponds (so quaint and beautiful!), expansive meadows that stretched into the mountains on the horizon. And fields of gold! ...by gold i mean fields of everything from wildflowers, beautiful tall grass, or even agricultural fields...it was all so scenic and picture-esque; took millions of pics. This one particular hill reminded me of Piedmont Park in Atl (which I love), which reminds me of Andrew Wyeth's <em>Christina's World</em>. Plenty of statues that aren't monuments, a King Kong (no idea why)...needless to say, I am quite, quite amused at this expansive very nearly hilarious amalgamation of art/architecture/monuments throughout the ages/the world. This was all under the hot sun in over 100-degree weather (Fahrenheit), enough to make me swear never to go near the Tropic of Cancer ever again! I won't miss this subtropical climate...<br /><br />This morning, we went boating on the lake- called Carp Lake in English, located at the foot of the LiYu Mountains in ShouFeng. They have amazing light/water shows on this lake at night, but alas, we had to miss out because we're on a train back to Taipei as it's happening. Anyway, the townspeople could tell from a mile away how American I am and kept commenting on how Western I look. All this before I ever opened <font color=""#ff0000"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">m</font>y mouth to utter a single word of Chinese. So it must not be the way I speak; apparently I have a discernibly different mien from a Taiwanese native. I was amused as per usual, because I know that having been born and raised in the U.S., I must have ""ABC"" written all over me in the way I walk, carry myself, and even look at people. Especially in a more remote city like Hualien, it must be glaringly obvious. I don't mind or anything; I am a very in-between person when it comes to cultural identity (MUCH more to say about this; I'll make a separate post when I get back). At any rate, I am definitely such a water person- the lake is so gorgeous and I will always love recreational activities on lakes, oceans, or beaches. Okay, so maybe not Taiwan beaches...<br /><br />I forgot to mention how much of a staple aborigines are to the Hualien culture/environment. There are several aboriginal tribes that live in these mountains, and they are to Hualien what Native Americans have been to America (well bfore it became America and al). They take a lot of pride in their culture and live very rustic, agricultural lives, very close to nature and the earth. Yesterday we had lunch in an aboriginal restaurant at one of the little ""oasis"" spots (well, don't know what else to call it) along the winding roads. Were wary at first and didn't know what to expect, but it turned out to be delightful! The ""wild"" vegetables grown nearby by the aborigines themselves were excellent, believe it or not. The food was so natural and organic and really tasty- i mean it. It's so cool to see that people live this way still-- not that I could ever want to live that way or could even if i wanted to, but it's just interesting to catch a glimpse of what are essentially different types of civilizations in the world today. Keeps me from being too ethnocentric, something that is all too easy to do in America. We want/expect people to be just like us and think they're missing out on true life/happiness if they're not as ""civilized"" but that's just so imperialistic a way of thinking. So the aborigines were refreshing to see because they're true to themselves and take great pride in that, as they should...and that makes me happy to know.<br /><br />We're on the train back to Taipei and it's evening, so the darkness has obscured any possible breathtaking view of the east coast this time around. Being in the country was good, but I'll be glad to be back in the big city again. I pretty much &lt;3 Taipei.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Thursday 7.20.06<br /></strong><em>Liebestraum no. 3,057 and counting...<br /></em>I had the best dream ever in my life last night...yet another reminder of a story that has always been told, has existed all along and will never have an ending. And I will wait for however long it takes until I know, waiting for Godot, except that I am not waiting. Otherwise, where's the mystery? Don't let the enigma be unveiled... not yet."

"event","<p align=""left"">Dear friends,<br />In typical jessica fashion, i take about 200 words to say what i should've said in 2, so if you get a postcard from me and half of my tiny scrawl is covered by a huge-ass stamp and therefore illegible, i apologize. i had no idea the stamp would be so enormous, and i know that i look like a dumbass for babbling so much on a postcard, for crying out loud. i'm&nbsp;excessive like that, what can i say; surely you know this.&nbsp;no guarantee that airmail is going to actually deliver said postcards before i even return, but at least you know that i tried and that i'm thinking of you guys back home and i miss you!<br /><br />***<br /><br />As of now, i'm in a time crunch. I have less than an hour left on this comp (you'd think that a five star hotel would have better than windows freaking 98 in their comp lab but no! grrr) so here's the plan: i'm copying most of this from the old paper-and-pen journal i've been keeping on this trip, and i'll start in the present- that is, where i am/what i did today, and fill in the rest later. any attempt to keep up with my travel journal is the most daunting endeavor; overwhelming is an understatement- i've been here almost a week but it feels like a month because every day is packed, brimming over the surface. i'm having the most incredible time! okay, here goes.<br /><br />**apologies for the plethora of typos. this keyboard really sucks!**<br /><br /><strong><em>Thursday, July 20th&nbsp;<br /></em>Leaving the city on a jet...train</strong><br />It's like the Hogwarts Express! from platform 4 (alas, not 9 3/4), we (aunt, cousin, mom, dad, me) hopped on a train and now we're speeding away from the great city of Taipei, headed for Hualien, the most north-eastern coast of Taiwan for the next 2 days. From the window of the train I see everything from the terrible to the mundane as the island streams past me in one continuous, fluid, panoramic view. First the city, gritty construction sites of the new intra-island bullet train they're working on, little dotted reservoirs here and there, the countryside complete with farmers and their farmhouses, many dilapidated but fully functional buildings, a breathtaking view of the Pacific coast and a hazy glimpse of Turtle Island in the distance, shrouded in misty sea fog. Right now, to my left- there are acres of bona-fide rice fields- the rice farmers really do wear those stereotypical straw field-hats while they're working-- boy would the Western media have a field day with this one. haha. To might right, I see the rolling green mountain hills. It's a four hr. train ride to Hualien, and thank God for the iPod- i think Mahler 2 is officially my favorite Mahler symphony. Oh yeah, they have a ""karaoke lounge"" on the train, the most random thing ever- who would've thought ""karaoke!"" when they think of long 4 hr train ride? People amuse me. I still maintain that sober karaoke is simply unacceptable- it proves that you're definitely taking this shit too seriously- haha! the ""stewardesses"" on this train wear aboriginal costumes. makes me chuckle and remember my Chinese dancing days when i, too, wore that exact same costume in red. good memories, even though i felt utterly ridiculous at the time, not to mention in pain from the 100 lb head piece.<br /><strong>10:30 pm<br /></strong>I had the most amazing day! I may be more of a mountain person than i thought- okay, not really, but Taroko National Park has been the only mt. experience in my life that i thoroughly enjoyed and LOVED. we took a 3 hr tour through Taroko via tourbus, and what a dangerous and harrowing experience it was! it was literally a gripping combination of usual crazy Taiwan traffic (we're talking cars/motorcycles passing across double yellows on a regular basis, and motorcycles basically doing whatever the hell they want since they're not cars, etc- except that many parts of the mountain roads are barely wide enough to fit one car, so to avoid head-on collisions (it's a miracle anyone has the nerve to attempt driving up there), all drivers honk their horns as they turn corners; oftentimes, when there's a conflict, one car will have to back up to let the other go first. this is all happening at like, over 5000 ft. above sea level on hair-raisingly steep cliffs, with imminent danger of making one slight false move and falling over the starkly vertical precipice. Every bit of this tour was simply astounding- i have never seen such cliffs in my entire life, never been on mountains that reached so high or dropped so suddenly. At certain places we'd get off and hike or walk around- amazing photo ops; i tried the best i could, but no ink on paper or image in a memory card can capture what it was like to stand where i stood today and feel amazed at not only nature, but man's ability to build and conquer all this space. we visited Tunnel of nine turns (it resulted from the Li Wu River creating a narrow gorge called ""skyline"" because the shores extend along the river; Swallow Grotto (one of the famous scenic spots along Central Cross Highway where birds used to fly together and nest in the area- youcan still see the holes they used to inhabit!); Tzei Lu Cliff (on the north side of the Li Wu river, formed of MARBLE- the whole thing is 1200m wide, 600m high, 16 km long, and it meets the Fu Ji cliff via river- simply spectacular); Eternal Spring Shrine (built in Chinese style architecutre, its cascade falls down to the Li Wu River and truly looks like a Chinese painting- we got to get closer up to this one too, and my pics came out rather well- yay); and my favorite part- hiking the ShaKaDang Trail and going wading in the turquois blue clear ""lagoon"" at the bottom. the trail is made of marble and this was the only part of the Taroko i saw today with crystal clear immaculate blue water- it felt SOOO good! After the Taiwan earthquake in '99, much of the water (i'd say like 99 percent) of it went from beautiful aqua to brackish gray. Brackish is the word of the day; i've never seen water like that before- it looks not dirty, but almost sad, as if the earth is still in recovery from the rape of the earthquake. the way the water flowed reminds me of the Great River Anduin (a la Lord of the Rings!), but heavily laden with granite sediments. It was kind of a sad sight to see, that sad, knowing brackishness. This all reminded me so much of Brevard last year when we'd go hiking in the Blue Ridge mts- very harrowing adventures those were too, and many beautiful waterfalls- but absolutely a molehill compared to the immaculate heights of Taroko National Park! they will see us waving from such great heights indeed! oh, i absolutely loved it, and i'm not even an outdoor girl at all, not to mention a mountain girl. the atmosphere connoted such an air of ancient Chinese folklore, years of history and that Chinese proverb story about the man who moved an entire mountain because ""where there's a will, there's a way"" as well as many other lessons i learned in Chinese school years ago but have pushed to the recesses of mental cache in my mind.&nbsp;<br /><br />after the tour, we checked into our hotel here in Hualien. went to the beach down the street- Taiwan beaches are completely unlike American ones- totally rocky and steep and industrial, mostly for fishing off the coast. lighthouses, construction, all those rocks give it such an eery air of danger, like it's a horror movie and something dark is lurking around the corner. the combination of quarry, fishing, lighthouses and beaches really pervert my American-bred ideal of fun-in-the-sun, romantic beaches. it's nothing like that here, and although it's fun and beautiful in its own way, the contrast between my expectation of the beach archetype and the reality of this island's rocky, pacific coasts are disturbing. I can't quite put a finger on what's&nbsp;so unsettling about the beaches here, but there's something dark about it.<br /><br />this evening we went shopping in the city of Hualien- it's very much like Taipei except many more motorcycles and less crowded and less consolidated and a little less exciting somehow (well, naturally- Taipei is probably one of my fave cities in the world! i seriously LOVE it). I finally found the perfect black pumps and perfect black slides (that's a total of 5 pairs of shoes i've bought since i've been here...a girl can NEVER have enough shoes!) and well- what can i say, i'm a girl, and finding sexy shoes makes me happy! the pollution here sucks- seriously, the fumes are burning my eyes. <br />***<br /><br />Well that's all the time i have today, friends and foes- i'd love to tell you all about the amazingness of Taipei, my thoughts on culture, other experiences i've had, how i've been living in style (heh heh, i sound so pretentious) and what this experience of visiting my roots has been like for me...but alas! my time is almost up. I'm copy/pasting this from an email to a friend, something i wrote a couple days ago at my aunt's house in Taipei:<br /><br />Life at home seems so far away because I AM HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE! I do miss my musical self though- so out of touch with it here. There is way too much to say; i've been writing in my paper and pen journal and i may post some stuff up on my blog from that sometime. brief points:<br /><br />-I have been shopping as if i were being paid to. <br />-Taipei 101 is the - i don't know what to call it- ""mall"" of all malls? mall is not sufficient to describe this orgasm of designer boutiques and then some! i am so serious: it would make even Barney's in NYC look like the dollar store. not that i've been there. but it makes Lenox Mall look like Wal-Mart or something, and...well, honestly you have NO idea...taipei 101 + the financial district of Taipei basically equals heaven.<br />-if i had a 10,000 shopping spree, i'd go to Gucci and buy SHOES. they have the best shoes in the world.<br />-i am learning more and more about myself as i'm here. too much to say on this one, but for now i'll leave it at: i am realizing how very much we are shaped by the culture in which we grew up.<br />-america needs to be more like Taiwan! fashionably, at least. <br />-food is so tasty and amazing. people eat whenever and whatever, and everyone is so slim and chic and trendy.<br />-this is the most unromantic place in the world but somehow has this amazing vibrancy that i can't describe. it's such an individualistic, independent environment...incredibly unique.<br />-i bought post cards today so expect to hear from me soon!<br />-i had lunch at my dad's old coworker's apt. in the upper east side of Taipei and omg it reminded me of patrick bateman's apt. no joke. i have pics.<br />-subway stations here are Immaculate! i am not kidding. nyc subways? marta? puhleeeze...this place is amazing.<br />-i keep alternating between missing America and hating some aspects of american culture...<br />-Taiwan's environment is a much healther one to grow up in (emotionally, i think). more on this later.<br />-i have shopped till i dropped and i'm going to keep going.<br />...ahhhh soooo much has happened and i can't even begin to try to say it in detail (updating my blog is too overwhelming a task so i just refrain).&nbsp;<br /><br />oh yeah, my professional Vogue-esque photo shoot lasted 7 hours,and it was an amazing learning experience about the art of photography and fashion! holy crap, i have so much to say but no time! i cant' wait to see how the pics turned out (this sunday!). and i see my sister Saturday at long last (aaand we're going to meet a special certain...ahem no comment) and i can't wait for that too. hahahhaa...<br /><br />i'll post up some other stuff i wrote in my paper and pen journal as soon as i can. oh yeah, and the time difference is exactly 12 hours from eastern standard time. this is when being nocturnal comes in handy; i didn't have much trouble adjusting. haha. <br /><br />i hope you are all doing well, my friends in other places!<br /><br />yours excitedly! with love,<br />Jessica<br /><br /></p>"

Tolkien's <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lord of the Rings</span>, but in case you needed refreshing, this poetic refrain by Bilbo Baggins is a leitmotif of sorts throughout the epic journey. This one has always stood out to me among the many great poems of the saga because it captures the essence of the story's tremendous emotional spectrum in just eight lines. Moreover, it perfectly captures the life's continuity, with all of its goodbyes and growing up and new beginnings. The poem has always struck me as a bit melancholy, for oit seems like a matter-of-fact observation fraught with nostalgia and contemplation.<br /><br />We initially encounter these lines at the beginning of the story, before Frodo embarks on his quest, and interestingly, we see it again at the end, when they return home, and all is said in done, but its form is slightly altered:<br /><br style=""font-weight: bold;"" /><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 120);"">The Road goes ever on and on</span><br style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 120);"" /><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 120);"">    Down from the door where it began.</span><br style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 120);"" /><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 120);"">Now far ahead the Road has gone,</span><br style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 120);"" /><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 120); font-style: italic;"">    Let others follow it who can!</span><br style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 120);"" /><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 120); font-style: italic;"">Let them a journey new begin,</span><br style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 120); font-style: italic;"" /><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 120); font-style: italic;"">    By I at last with weary feet</span><br style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 120); font-style: italic;"" /><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 120); font-style: italic;"">Will turn towards the lighted inn.</span><br style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 120); font-style: italic;"" /><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 120);""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">    My evening rest and sleep to meet</span>.</span><br /><br />In four words, you could say, ""there and back again.""<br /><br />And that is precisely what <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Beethoven's Sonata op. 109</span> should be titled. <br /><br />I confess that I've had a lot of trouble understanding late Beethoven and what to do with it, how to think of it, and ultimately, how to play it. Late Beethoven is what bridged the Classical era to the Romantic, and it's so unlike any other musical genre I've ever had to study.&nbsp; The notes are easy, which makes it all the more difficult- they are so few that not a single one is wasted, and every one speaks volumes. I don't think I'll truly understand this sonata for years (it's one of those pieces that has to ferment, and some pieces take years longer than others), but I have a few ideas. What I do know, based on the small amount of research I've done, what I've learned in my lessons, and on comments from judges in competitions, is how this piece feels and should feel: not only like an epic journey followed by a homecoming, not only of a transformation, but a sense of timeless infinity and, essentially: eternity. <br /><br />The bare-bones, minimalized sonata-form first and second movements are what I like to call ""sonata form on speed,"" haha-- or, more accurately, sonata form in the smallest nutshell possible. They're hard, but not remarkably difficult...until the epic third movement (a set of theme and variations), which is where the real work is. It is basically the entire sonata itself, especially the last variation. By the end, you really feel like you've come a full cycle, having made a big journey of philosophical growth and transformation (kind of like Liszt's B minor Sonata). The transitions really make it beautiful. There is all this gradual buildup (with the subdivisions, four/three-hand effects with the trills, and so much more to drive pianists crazy) of mass and volume and tension, intensity, and suddenly..<span style=""font-style: italic;"">.behold!</span> The lights dim, the roar of excitement diminishes to its proper place and time, everything&nbsp; falls away, and the sonata ends on the da capo of the original hymn-like theme. <br /><br />But how different the same notes sound when heard again after experiencing the variations! The subtle difference is like the difference between opening a door and closing a door. And I think that is the very nature of this sonata's transformation: it's not that anything's really different at the end, but that you <span style=""font-style: italic;"">perceive</span> it to be so because <span style=""font-style: italic;"">you</span> have been so changed. It is precisely like the two different versions of Bilbo Baggins' poem. Beethoven, at the end of his life, had been there, done that; he has seen it all, and the da capo theme, marked ""cantabile"" this time around instead of its original ""mezza voce,"" seems increasingly expressive and retrospective now, as if to say, like Tolkien did in his own masterpiece: ""<span style=""font-style: italic;"">The road goes ever on and on...Let others follow it who can! Let them a journey new begin; But I at last with weary feet...</span>"". The story, after all, is not just about the journey and its denouement- it's also about the homecoming. <br /><br />There and back again.<br /><br />But that's not all, for to leave out the crucial aspect of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">eternity</span> in conceptualizing this sonata would be leaving out a large part of the picture. The piece denies us a sense of ultimate finality by ending on an imperfect authentic cadence in the home key, suggesting perhaps that it's not really over. This amazing subtety is genius- it engenders a visceral sense of uncertainty in the listener's mind, leaving us wondering <span style=""font-style: italic;"">what happened? what's it all about?</span> The end is by no means an actual end. That leads me to quesion, is it <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ever</span> really over? Furthermore, did it ever really begin? The nobility and majesty of the theme, especially its closing imperfect cadence, definitely suggest <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">timeless infinity</span> (a hallmark of Beethoven's late works). It's not that the piece ever really began or ended, but rather, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">it has been here all along.</span> It is eternity, stretching on forever and ever, expanding beyond the horizons of our perception in all directions. It makes us mere mortals feel so small in the grande scheme of the universe. But we are by no means any less poignant or significant-- I have always thought that this sonata,&nbsp; as well as many other sagas like it, mean to be optimistic. We're all part of the same great microcosm, this is <span style=""font-style: italic;"">our</span> story, and we're free to reinvent ourselves at will. (and it's no coincidence that Beethoven often dabbled in improvisation at the end of his career). As expressed by the infinite wisdom of one of my greatest heroes, Tolkien: <em>Do not be too sad...you will have to be one and whole, for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be, and to do, as long as your part of the story goes on.</em><br /><br />No matter how many times we go there and back again, the road still goes ever on and on. It's a serene bittersweetness (like the diminished seventh chords that constantly reoccur throughout op. 109) that retains a refreshing, invaluable optimism. And that's what makes this sonata so beautiful. I don't need to say anything more, as T.S. Eliot has already said it for me, years ago: ""What we think of as the beginning is often the end. To make an end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from."" Ad infinitum.<br /><br /><font size=""4"" style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(191, 0, 0);"">***<br /><br /></font>With that said, I should have listened when my teachers throughout the years told me I wasn't ready to play Beethoven Sonata Op. 109. I learned this the hard way because I'm in deep trouble now-- I have to play this for my sophomore recital today (I know...op. 109 and ""sophomore"" in the same sentence just don't belong, haha). The entire sonata. I simply lack the necessary experience, perspective, and maturity to play a piece like this, and the more I learn about the piece, the more I understand why this is the case. ""Oh, it can't be that hard...nothing I can't work up to!"" I said, once upon a time, being the youthful naive thing that I am. This is not a piece one plays at the young age of twenty (unless you've had a ton of experience and have most all of Beethoven's repertoire already under your belt) and I'm sorry that I won't be able to do this amazing sonata justice. If you don't know what I'm talking about, then you don't know late Beethoven, period.&nbsp; Even understanding the ideas behind it doesn't mean that I can play it and communicate all the nuances I have yet to discover. I simply picked the wrong time in my life to play it- Rome wasn't built in a day, you know. So while I may get through it in my recital without major trainwrecks, understand that I don't pretend for one minute to be an authority on this piece. I know I am much too young and excitable for a retropective piece like this which requires so much patience. I know that there is so much more to this Sonata than I can possibly fathom at this stage in my life, because I'm limited by my youth and circumstances. Even the most amazing teachers can't help you in this case- they can tell you how to play it, but they can't fast-forward your life and maturity. This is one of those rare pieces where it absolutely must be a part of you in order to really feel it. Yes, it is <span style=""font-style: italic;"">that</span> esoteric. When I pull this out again when I'm in my thirties or forties, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">then </span>I'll be able to make some music. But for today- well, I know- what was I thinking?! <br /><br />But I'm glad I had the opportunity to get exposed to it. It is definitely the hardest piece I have ever tried to play. I never ever would have guessed in a thousand years that music so simple could be so profound.<br /><br />On a final (and more humorous) note, one of the winners of the Lagrange Symphony Orchestra competition this year, whom I met at the winner's recital, told me that her professor loves Op. 109 so much that he immortalized his love of it it with a vanity license plate bearing ""109"". I found that pretty nerdy, and by nerdy, i mean awesome. I'm definitely beginning to see why this sonata could inspire and merit such reverence.<br /><br /><a target=""_new"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._30_%28Beethoven%29"">Read more about it here. </a>"

"event","there comes a time in every girl's life...<br>
<br>
when she just has to muster the courage to decide that she is just
going to, once and for all, pay for a haircut. see, the last time i had
my hair trimmed was in January. and i decided, that since haircuts are
such an infrequent event in my little life, my beautiful, dark,
to-die-for sexy hair deserves nothing less than the best. sure there
are places i could get it done more easily/cheaply perhaps, but i'm
going out on a limb this time (and hopefully forever, if i like them)
and getting it cut at <a href=""http://www.vanmichael.com/"" target=""_new""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Van Michael</span></a>. this place was highly recommended
to me, and it's kind of a risk for me because i have no idea how much
they charge, but it's worth it! <img src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/smiley5.gif"" height=""15"" width=""15"">
can't go wrong with a top-of-the-line Aveda salon, can you? anyway,
wish me luck. i'm probably going to trim off about 3 inches.<br>


<br>


oh yeah. speaking of 3 inches. let me say (<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">rant about</span>) this once and for all about <br>


<a href=""http://www.locksoflove.org/"" target=""_new"">LOCKS OF LOVE</a>:<br>


<br>


i am really fucking fed up with people trying to guilt me into feeling
obligated to donate my luscious locks to Locks of Love. true, if i cut
off 10 inches of my hair, it will still be considered relatively
""long."" but, as we all know, i like to wear my hair
superlong/longer-than-average. i look better this way, and it makes me
more unique than every other girl you see with normal-length hair. and
i have the right to prefer extralong hair over long hair, because it's
really no different than say, preferring jeans over khakis, and
everybody is allowed to prefer jeans over khakis or whatever it is that
they like, no? (and since when did preferring one kind of fabric over another become a moral issue?)<br>


<br>


<span style=""font-style: italic;"">but jessica</span>, you say-<span style=""font-style: italic;""> there are like, sick children out there who lost all their hair and need it more than you do.</span>
excuse me? what do you expect me to say to that? please finish your drink,
because there are sober children in Africa? (quote courtesy of
that facebook group). pardon my ignorance, but please inform me: when
was the last time that baldness was a cause of death? hah. i thought
so. the ones who try to make me feel obligated to donate my hair are
obviously being hopelessly myopic here- do they not see the inherent
flaw in their argument? i'm vain for insisting on having hair this
long, because i don't need all this hair to stay alive. yet,&nbsp;
the would-be recipients of my donated hair aren't vain at all for
wanting hair, which they do not need to stay alive, and which would not
in any way ameloirate their chronic illness. no, not vain. of course not. never. such
masterful logic. i am humbled. <br>


nobody ""needs"" hair more than anyone
else. they just want it.&nbsp; so anyone who would want my hair is
being just as vain as i am. (i know, i know, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">don't state the obvious</span>, you say).<br>


<br>


and if i am a horrible person for not donating my hair, then anyone who
doesn't donate blood is an even more evil/immoral person. because
people actually DO need blood, unlike a full head of hair, to stay
alive. furthermore, if this Locks of Love thing is a cause you believe in so
strongly, why aren't you growing your hair 10 inches longer to donate
it to your worthy cause? can't put your money where you mouth is, huh? i thought so. somehow, ""<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">hypocrite</span>"" just doesn't quite say
it. <br>


<br>

when i'm older, i may not be able to get away with having hair this
long, so i'm damn well going to enjoy it while i have the chance. if
and when i DO make the big cut, to look more womanly/adult/professional
or whatever, then sure, i'll donate it, because if i don't want it
anymore, why not? i mean, if you WANT to donate your hair to Locks of
Love, then great for you!
i have nothing against your preference. but it's just not a practical endeavor for someone who doesn't
voluntarily want to donate. it's also impractical to expect things from others that you do not do yourself. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">bottom line:</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> THERE. IS. NO. OBLIGATION. </span>bitches.<br>


<br>

and the next person who tries to make me feel like a bad, bad person
for not cutting off the 10 inches (essentially, anyone who fails to
realize that this is a matter of preference, not of some nebulous
notion of morality) will be hung upside down by their
toenails and subjected to Stravinsky's <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Rite of Spring</span> for 24 hours without interruption. or D. Diamond's <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Rounds</span>. or a nasty combination of the two. over. and. over. again.<br>

<br>

that is all for today, ladies and gentlemen. enjoy Thanksgiving :-D<br>"

<br>
</span><span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">
Do you understand, gentlemen, that all the horror is in just this: that there is no horror!</span></span></span><br>
<br>
<span style=""font-style: italic;"">American Psycho </span> epitomizes these words of Russian writer Aleksandr Kuprin. Whether
you've seen Mary Harron's 2000 film adaptation or read Bret
Easton Ellis's novel, you'll know that, above all, this story is a
satire- hilarious, engaging, and one of the greatest dark comedies of
our time. The jacketing and marketing of the film version, however, are
disappointing and misleading. It's clear that Ellis wrote the novel for
an intelligent, witty, and perceptive audience (and Barnes&amp;Noble
rightfully shelved it in Fiction&amp;Literature alongside other great
lit classics), but the movie was
marketed to appeal to horror-film lovers, easily overlooking the
story's most outstanding quality: its pitch-black humor. Even I, upon
first encountering it, thought, ""ah, another tacky horror flick!""
Little did I (and countless others) know how wrong i was, but i guess
you can't blame Blockbuster too much for categorizing it as
Horror/Drama/Thriller-- what else are they going to do, shelve it under
Comedy? No wait, that might really offend some peoples' blithe,
happy-go-lucky notion of what ""funny"" means, because, you know, it
really doesn't jive with movies like that absurdly witless uh, what was
it again?<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Napoleon Dynamite</span>? Heaven forbid. <br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></div>

<div style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">
American Psycho</span> is not for the faint of heart. The fictional Patrick
Bateman's first-person narrative makes Hannibal Lecter seem like your
genuinely friendly, trustworthy, next-door neighbor. Graphic is an
understatement (oh baby, you ain't seen nothin' yet). The
stomach-churning murder, torture, and cannabalism scenes, the
meticulous minutia of Bateman's lifestyle from designer
threads to more beauty products than the entire inventory of a spa, sex
so mindblowing that it will convince you that two lesbians in a
threesome is worth the loss of sanctity in marriage (well, until they
get murdered), the horror at how suddenly things twist- from passion to
apathy, from sex to violent murder; or perhaps, how all the
distinctions between the horrible and the mundane, between fantasy and
reality- are blurred and virtually indistinguishable. <br>
<br>
Don't listen to those who say this novel is trash- one lengthy,
pointless, exhausting exercise that ends on a frustrating, unresolved
chord of
ambuguity. Anyone who says so is clearly incapable of percieving
Ellis's many carefully-controlled nuances. This is an extremely complex
story that's enjoyable and&nbsp;
well-executed (no pun intended?) on so many levels. It's a statement of
America at the turn of the century, an indictment of
the dark side of Reagan-era optimism: blatant excess, the
superficiality of the
pampered, elite, New York Yuppie
lifestyle, and Eighties greed. You have to keep in mind though, that
the horror is not in the story itself, but in the society it mirrors
(or rather, criticizes).<br>
<br>Love him or hate him,
Patrick Bateman will suck you into his world and keep you there. His
detached, nonchalant tone that pervades the entire narrative remains
constant and is what constitutes much of the novel's perfectly
vitriolic hilarity. He muses on the art of Phil Collins and Whitney
Houston in the exact same tone that he uses to detail his beauty and
fitness routines,describe the cut of his Armani suits, and recount the ways in which he
murders girls and eats their corpses (the film does a great job at
juxtaposing these elements by having him commit violent murder, all the
while chatting casually about Huey Lewis and the News. Flawless).
Patrick is
undeniably a madman of epic proportions, beyond all hope of redemption.
Because he has no conception of sympathy, empathy, guilt, nor regret,
he does not differentiate between the horror and the mundane; killing a
child and shopping for new Hugo Boss ties are simply two different ways
to pass the time. Ellis's themes are also strongly reminiscent of
Dostoyevsky and Camus. Like Meursault in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Stranger</span>,
there are no understandable motivations for Patrick's actions, making
him, if anything, scarier- for how can one protect against something
that has no rhyme or reason? Like 
Raskolnikov, Patrick's world is virtually nihilistic- where societal
bonds and real emotion are absent and strict materialism reigns. It's a
world in which the elegance of a business card or a dinner reservation
evokes more reaction than murder and mayhem (that was quite a hilarious scene, i might add). <br>
<br>
As a
reader, you're both revolted and morbidly fascinated by Patrick
Bateman. You will not be able to put this book down. The high gloss of
his classy lifestyle, which takes place in
all the hottest
restaurants, bars, homes, and clubs in New York City- is irresistable.
For
400 pages, i loved vicariously living the life of an uppercrust Yuppie-
and i have
to admit, you actually pick up quite a bid of useful side info about
designers, etiquette, and beauty. I mean, it's the kind of lifestyle we
all aspire to, just as Patrick is the kind of man every girl dreams of
marrying: Wall Street tycoon, born into immense wealth and privelege,
genuinely
perceptive and intelligent, Harvard-educated, and devastatingly
handsome --oh baby, can i get me some of that? Yet, behind the
perfectly coiffed exterior is a fascinating paradox- he's the
embodiment of success, but&nbsp; but to the point where nothing's ever
been a challenge to him; having access to everything he wants, he
reaches the
point where nothing is worth looking forward to or enjoying anymore. He
is beyond being even an Aristotelian tragic figure, and despite his capacity
of introspection and realization about his grotesque nature...<span style=""font-style: italic;"">even
after admitting this, coming face-to-face with these truths, no new
understanding can be extracted from my telling. This confession has
meant nothing...</span> indeed,<span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">the true horror is that there is no horror</span>.<br>
<br>
So yeah, it's pretty hopeless. I warn you though, you might find some
Patrick Bateman-esque lines/qualities creep into your life as you read
this. I mean that in the most benign of ways, in case you're worried. The novel's simply full of great scenes, including the best break-up
ever (""You're just not...terribly...important to me""), a great
replacement for the I-have-to-wash-my-hair excuse (""I have to go return
some videotapes""), and, upon being questioned for possible clues about a
colleague who might have been murdered, Patrick tells the detective,
""Uh, he ate a balanced diet."" You can't really help but root for him,
because there is just something so slick and hilarious about being so
matter-of-fact about everything. ""I'll have a J&amp;B on the rocks and
a butcher knife or something sharp from the kitchen."" Indeed.<br>
<br>
I'd definitely recommend watching the movie because it's a quick way to
gain appreciation for the story first. The screenplay is very well done,
but it forces the interpretation of the ending on you, a good interpretation, but one i don't
agree with. The novel makes some definite hints at a more, shall i say,
David Lynch's <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mullholland Drive</span>-
esque ending. In fact, the structure is almost identical. My advice is to view it from a metaphysical perspective and be careful what you take literally. After all,
the whole point of the story is summed up in a quote by Judith Martin
that prefaces the novel: ""<span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">If we followed every impulse, we'd be killing one another.</span>""
Amen. Patrick only wishes he could be as
sensational as his narrative, but civilization's restraints render him
only demure and proper in reality. But he's still feeling just as
trapped and
ineffectual, frustrated, and just plain stifled by his
apex-of-privilege life, simultaneously living with violent impulses and
the inability to act them out. It's very arguable about what really
happened, but
read it and you tell me. If nothing else, it is probably the funniest
thing i've ever
read. <br>
<br>
I could go on forever about this, but I have to return some videotapes.<br>

english literature and writing and philosophy and rock music and good
films and nutrition/fitness/exercise with passion. i do. but it's nice to, for seven entire weeks, to
just focus on one aspect of me, the one i hold so dear: music. at
school i always felt spread too thin, i always felt like i had to be
everything, to be so well-rounded, to keep up with so much, but here
there are no distractions. everyone's a musician, this is what we do,
and i'm realizing more and more that i am in the right place, that this <span style=""font-style: italic;"">is</span> what i want to do with my
life.<span style=""font-style: italic;""><br>
</span>
the atmosphere is actually very relaxed (come on now, it's all nature-y and
outdoorsy), but people here take music very seriously. it's not cutthroat, but it's still <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">quality.</span> it's a great
balance. it's basically like any place you go- there are all sorts of
people. you have the good and the bad, the people who are here to have
fun, the people who are super competitive. i'm in awe of some of the
people here, and a bit intimidated- they have so much repertoire!
experience! they've done so much! played so much! and then there's me, and i have
a long way to go. but most of all, i feel so <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">inspired</span></span>
by the people here and the environment itself. sometimes i feel
worthless...but then i remember that i do have potential, that i am <span style=""font-style: italic;"">not</span> a terrible pianist, that i <span style=""font-style: italic;"">can</span>
hold my own in the competitions here, that once upon a time, at my
college auditions and before that, other people did in fact see
something in me and believe in me. i remind myself that, <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">despite evidence to the contrary</span>,&nbsp; i&nbsp; at
least have it<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in </span>me
to become good too. that alone is enough to keep me going. i'm worried
about the competitions...it's REALLY tough to even get past the
preliminaries, but hey, i DO have a fabulous concerto (and omg, no one
else is playing it! score!) and that piece has finally clicked for me-
you know how sometimes you study a piece for a long time and you never
really GET it until a certain point? well i get it now, at long last, and i'm getting
really good feedback, so i feel like i stand a decent shot at making it
to the finals. i have a great accompanist (my friend Pei-Wei, a grad
student at Carnegie Mellon), and i'm accompanying her in return on the
Saint-Saens G minor concerto (thank god the accompaniment is easy), and
it's all going to be fabulous. <br>
<br>
the listening experience is very inspiring as well. the concerts and
recitals here are great. i have to usher for my work-study scholarship,
so i'm at every weekend concert (4 hrs per week, but it can get pretty
exhausting), and i
try to attend every recital i can. they have one every single night, as
well as student/faculty recitals in the afternoon. Lomozov totally blew
everyone away with her performance of a Chopin Polonaise the other day,
and...wow...she just has such a dynamic presence. what a powerhouse!
i'm going to do everything i can to take a masterclass with her on my
Chopin concerto, because she's just fabulous at romantic music. tonight
i heard a performance of Dvorak's <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Symphony no. 6</span>,
and wow, i think i just fell in love; talk about total captivation!
this past week i heard Timothy Adams (percussionist) in concert- very
very interesting. I really enjoyed last weekend's <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Barber of Seville</span>
performance- full of good, zinging jokes and you can't go wrong with
Figaro. too bad they didn't sing it in Italian though! grrrr.&nbsp;
(those Opera kids are crazy though, but at least they have great
parties...haha, maybe more on that later). I'm totally looking forward
to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">HMS Pinafore, Sweeney Todd, </span>and, of course, my beloved <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Rigoletto! </span>(wrote a paper on that in high school, and you know how i love a good tragedy). <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Opera is love. </span><img src=""http://premium.xanga.com/Images/cool.gif""> <br>
<br>
i had my first lesson this week and it went fabulously! ended up
lasting an hour and a half instead of an hour! Dr. Weeks is a GREAT
teacher- i've noticed that he really focuses on form and analysis; he
has such insight about a piece in the grand scheme of things- like how,
in Baroque music, falling chromaticism connotes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">suffering </span>(now this changes how i play the Bach fugue in D minor<span style=""font-style: italic;"">), </span>how
falling chromaticism in Classical music represents confusion and chaos;
he knows so much history and then some- and he's really exciting and a
great communicator. I started hating Opus 7 (Beethoven) but after my
lesson, i totally LOVE it again- it's just so full of energy and it's
all, well, Eflat Major esque; need i say more? haha, even though i'm
not much of an Eflat Major personality...i like the piece =) he's
definitely very strong on classical music, especially Beethoven. oh
yes! And we're having STUDIO BONDING on sunday! he's taking us up to
Pisgah View Ranch, Candler Valley at the foot of Mt. Psgah, the Blue
Ridge Parkway, Looking Glass Falls, and Sliding Rock at the Pisgah
National Forest (up near Asheville) on Sunday. We're going to have an
awesome brunch and then enjoy
the beautiful scenery, and i'm sooo terribly excited to become a family
with my studio, because that's something i definitely don't have at
school and have always always wanted. Dr. Weeks is great like that. =) <br>
<br>
And classes are thoroughly enjoyable. Survey of Russian Piano lit is
taught by Lomozov, Weeks teaches Beethoven class, and every friday we
have a thing called The Pianists' Studio, by FAR my favorite! Dr.
Howsman from Oberlin led it, and we talked about careers for musicians
(he even gave us that Juilliard article from the NY Times! such a good
article). I asked a lot of questions about qualifications for grad
school, for getting&nbsp; a job at a university, climbing the uh,
musical ladder to success (much like the corporate ladder...eeep). so i
have a much better idea now of what i need to do in order to make it
out there, to get a job at all, the importance of connections, how to
build your musical resume, and i don't want to waste another second. a
lifetime really IS NOT enough for music (can't remember which composer
said that). and i have all these goals, and so much more focus about my
goals now, and i feel <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">so overwhelmed </span>because
there is so much to do in so little time, in this brief little life of
mine, because i so desperately want to be a musician and all this
uncertainty of whether or not i'll ever succeed is very
anxiety-inducing.<br>
<br>
there are things i'm really going to miss about this place when i have
to leave in 5 weeks, mainly the people and the environment. i've
learned so much already. about music, the music business, musicians,
and myself, even. i realize the importance of going to music festivals
like this one- if you really want to succeed in music one day, you have
to at least go once- i mean, how are you ever going to get into a
school or get a job if you don't get your name out there, if no one
knows who you are? and also, like my friend/roommate salima says, you
never know when or where you might find that teacher that just makes
everything <span style=""font-style: italic;"">click</span>. and i've
been thinking a lot about, and talking to friends about which summer
music festivals to apply to for next summer, how i want to win
something here this summer so that i can at least come back here next
year if nothing else, where i want to apply for grad school, who i
might study with...etc etc. don't wanna make the same mistake i made in
high school. it takes an incredible amount of energy and initiative and
overcoming your fears to succeed and anything, and i want to try my
hardest.<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>i've been practicing
so much more than i ever did at home- it's extremely exhausting,
because i'm juggling a LOT of music right now- the concerto, my piano
competition program (at least 30 min of music), the Saint Saens
accompaniment, and on top of that, my whole new entire program for next
year (the 2-3 movments of the Chopin concerto, Beethoven op. 109- omg
late Beethoven is a KILLER don't play it! haha, and Bach Prelude in
Fugue in F sharp minor from WTC II...yeah kill me now). but hey,&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> life is too short to not be ambitious.</span><br>
<br>
and i've learned that just because someone goes to a prestigious music
school, that's NOT an excuse for you to automatically feel like you're
less than they are. and just because someone has a fabulous teacher
does NOT mean they're good. (be careful when you perform here- you will
be judged harshly. things like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">god, she sucks...how the hell did she get into lomozov's studio?! </span>yeah,
things like that. but hey, this is normal). the truth is, no one really
cares if you go to Manhattten or Juilliard or Eastman, because that
doesn't really mean anything- what matters is how well you actually
play (obviously, they tend to be good, because that's where the great
teachers are, but the point is, that's not a guarantee). and here, we
all understand that. and i'm glad. my first few days here, i felt so
regretful, like&nbsp; omg, this is why i missed out on by not going to
Eastman! but now i realize that i DO have everything i need right now,
the most fabulous teacher ever imagineable, and that i'm in the right
place. sure, there are things i don't like about UGA music program,
mainly the environment (party party party), the way people act like
it's like, omg, SO WEIRD to practice 5 hrs a day? are you freaking
kidding me? i'm a MUSIC MAJOR. if you're not practicing 5-6 hours a
day, you're definitely not going to get your work done. honestly, it's
not the hours that matter, it's just the fact that learning music takes
time, and here we all practice at least 5-6 hours a day (or if you're
in orch, you have rehearsal), and practice rooms are so hard to come
by, and people here can be rather bitchy about them...ugh. but it does
motivate you to practice whenever you get the chance, so i'm not
complaining =) and i love how people take music so seriously here,
because i take it seriously too, and i&nbsp; don't get this kind of
environment at all at school, which makes me kind of dread having to go
back.
but part of me can't wait to get back there and throw myself into my
studies and learn and learn and learn and improve and achieve,
especially with the perspective that i have now. and hey, the sooner i
go back, the sooner i'll be on my way to getting the HELL out of
georgia, onto grad school hopefully at a great school, up in new
england or someplace where music is much more of a respected
profession. i'm practically the only one of my friends from the south
(they all go to those schools up in new england) and i envy them. but i
know that it's not my time yet, that i have a long way to go before i
get there, but the hope and this crazy belief in myself that i have
keeps me going. <br>
<br>
okay, my once-a-week internet time is up for now- honestly, i have a
love/hate relationship with the 'net- it's so terribly distracting,
this getting online business, but i can't help myself either. i wanted
to pour out what i'm feeling at this moment in time because, well, i'd
explode otherwise. i'm just so happy to be here, but not a
paradise-esque happiness- it's tons of hard work and very very
exhausting. when i have to go home, i'll be ready, but i do hope that
this momentum doesn't slow down. i hope this energy and passion that i
have today stays with me long after i leave Brevard.<br>
<br>so long for now. maybe i'll tell you about my social life, the awesome friends i've made,
my exercise/fitness routine, and the boys...next time <img src=""http://www.xanga.com/Images/smiley3.gif"" height=""15"" width=""15"">
hey, we know how to work hard here,
but we know how to party hard too. and this weekend is going to be
crazy. for July 4th, we're gonna have REAL CANNONS on the lawn for the
1812 Overture! (and i'm working at that concert to...ahhhh...). and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">JOSHUA BELL</span>
is making his debut here on Sunday! i'm thrilled to be seeing him live
in concert, but i am not looking forward to the chaos and screaming
girls and starstruck fans (um, myself included) that will inevitably
accompany this huge event.<br>
<br>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">immerse yourself in music. </span><br>
<br>
it feels so good to work hard again. i can honestly say that i have not felt this alive in a long,&nbsp; long time.</div>"

<P>it's a masterpiece, and David Lynch is a genius.</P>
<P>definitely one of the most challenging films i've ever watched. it's an unexpectedly complex riddle. <STRONG>chekov's pistol </STRONG>is not to be underestimated/overlooked. pay attention to every detail. be aware of the implications of things. allusions (like the Rita Hayworth allusion? still haven't figured that one out...) are significant. take note of the characters-when they appear, under what circumstances, who they appear with, and where. this is a flim-noir-esque surrealistic tale that has everything in it- from &nbsp;magical realism, suspense, tragedy, mystery, denial, deception, lies, disillusionment, revenge,&nbsp;corruption, murder, desperation, jealousy, the seediness behind the glitz and glamour of hollywood, false hopes, and, the saddest of all, ruin. <EM>mulholland drive </EM>is above all, a tragedy.&nbsp;(an Aristotelian tragedy at that, i must say). it will raise goosebumps, give you the chills, make you cry- not only because of the masterful cinematic aspects and the dangerous, suspenseful plot, but from the gripping emotional trauma. there is no greater, more awful tragedy than being<EM>&nbsp;broken. </EM>seeing something that was once so full of promise come desperately unraveled is heartbreaking. </P>
<P>David Lynch sure puts a very unorthodox, original, and ingenious spin on things. despite the surrealism that abounds in <EM>mulholland drive, </EM>his way of capturing the reality (and un-reality) is as we see it: tangled up in conflicting desires, clouded by emotion, wishful thinking, and, at times, vengeful contempt. the truth is, we <EM>don't </EM>view reality in a linear, unresolving motion. we have flashbacks, fantasies, regrets, we envision scenarios of how things might have been. though we exist <EM>physically </EM>in reality and in the present, the scope of our existence is so much more- our memories, dreams, desires, emotions- all constitute the <EM>true </EM>reality we live in everyday. this movie is essentially&nbsp;a trip through somebody's mind- and more realistic than you think. i'm not sure if this movie was partly a social commentary and/or satire-esque rude awakening about the&nbsp;disillusionment of Hollywood, but it did bear those overtones at times. the film is slightly reminiscent of movies like Memento in its suspenseful nonlinear plot; it has an early 1900s mobster feel as well as Hitchcock-esque elements, and the subtle, charming 1950's vibe really brings a sense of nostalgia back into Hollywood cinema. but really, no other archetype or style comes close to describing this. </P>
<P>i've been wanting to get into David Lynch's work forever, and, this being the first of his work i've seen, i am enormously impressed. his style is&nbsp;definitely is an acquired taste, and if you don't like movies that tie your mind in knots, make you think, or cause you to reevaluate the way reality is percieved, then don't watch this movie -you'll only frustrate yourself. it definitely <EM>is </EM>very difficult to understand on the first viewing, simply because the way it's presented is so unexpected. if it helps, here's the best advice i can give while watching it for the first time: think of it from a <EM><b>metaphysical</b> </EM>perspective- what is significant is more important than what actually happens. I love how Lynch doesn't insult the audience by handing anything out on a silver platter- he only hints, gives subtle clues, and trusts you to solve the puzzle yourself. </P>
<P>there are countless little aspects of this film i'd love to delve into, but i don't want to ruin it for anyone (if you want to discuss it, by all means i am willing!). all i can say is that it is not for the faint of heart. this is one film that will continue to haunt you for a long, long time, and you will discover new things about it everytime you watch it. in short, it's fucking brilliant. go ahead, open Pandora's Box. Take a trip down Mulholland Drive. don't miss out.</P>

<TD>You are more introverted than extroverted.

Your type is best described by the word ""mastermind"", which belongs to the larger group called rationals. Only 1% of the population shares your type. You are very strong willed and self-confident. You can hardly rest until you have things settled. You will only adopt ideas and rules if they make sense. You are a great brainstormer and often come up with creative solutions to difficult problems. You are open to new concepts, and often actively seek them out.<BR>As a romantic partner, you can be both fascinating yet demanding. You are not apt to express your emotions, leaving your partner wondering where they are with you. You strongly dislike repeating yourself or listening to the disorganized process of sorting through emotional conflicts. You see your own commitments as self-evident and don't see why you need to repeat something already expressed. You have the most difficulty in admitting your vulnerabilities. You feel the most appreciated when your partner admires the quality of your innovations and when they listen respectfully to your ideas and advice.

"event","Despite my love of cold weather, pretty, classy winter clothing, the warm fuzziness of the Holidays, and that fresh, brisk crispness in the air, Spring really is my favorite season. Its arrival always has the presence of a flower softly blooming anew, always on the sly at first, then slowly spreading the warm sunshine of new beginings into the air with the pollen, renewing old delights and reminding us of things that we have forgotten to smile about, things that get inevitably lost beneath the piled-on layers of winter stress during those cold, harsh months. Spring's arrival always catches me unaware and every year at this time, I marvel at the annual emotional Renaissance that accompanies the season, that fills me with boundless optimism and genuine enthusiasm for living. This rosy flush in my cheeks, this way the sun slants through the blinds when I wake up for my morning classes, this benevolent breeze against my bare legs as I walk outdoors, clad in a skirt and open-toed shoes, this knowledge that summer is over the horizon but still a safe distance away... this, this is Spring, and it always comes at just the right moment, late enough so that we long for it, but never too soon. 

And I've just been thinking about how happy I am, how life could be described as perfect right now, and how lucky I am to be me and alive and here in this moment. you have to appreciate the little things, because sometimes the little things are all you have. 

Love is in the air. It's the spring, the friendship, the romance, the excitement, the contentment, and  whatever combination that entails- that make me happy. Life is far from perfect, but life is good, and although i know there will be even greater things to come in the future, today I can still truly say, as Louisa May Alcott does in Little Women, ""oh, my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you greater happiness than this!"""

Besides being poorly written, immature, silly, and far-fetched, it was essentially a transparently-disguised gripe about the fact that yes, people on this college campus are having sex. No way. You're kidding me. I mean,&nbsp;how dare they enjoy themselves and fail to bring about the ruin of civilization as well as&nbsp;the effacement of our last semblances of morality. </P>
<P>I have some advice for you, Miss Righteous and others who think like you: cry me a river, move me a mountain, and <EM>get over it. </EM></P>
<P>As if the claims that condom distribution sells cheap sex werent' annoying enough (what the hell encouraging people to be safe has to do with being cheap is beyond me), what <EM>really </EM>annoyed me about this letter were the implications that having sex and having dignity are mutually exclusive. As if sex outside the confines of marriages must most definitely involve the compromisng of integrity. And this annoyance extends toward my view of premarital sex in general (a topic i've discussed on numerous occasions with various friends). </P>
<P>Since i'm here, I might as well bare all:</P>
<P>Look, people who are waiting for the Right Person have the right not to made fun of. And people who do it before they say ""I Do"" deserve the right not to be looked down upon. What i really hate is how so many people seem to think that there are only 2 choices: slut or angel. Let's be realistic: abstaining until marriage doesn't make one an ""angel"" anymore than premarital sex makes one a ""slut""...just like going to church doesn't make you a Christian anymore than going to Waffle House makes you a waffle. There are girls who make a popsicle out of a different dick every weekend, but&nbsp;it's all good; they're still chaste, unsullied virgins&nbsp;because they haven't actually ""done it.""&nbsp; Um,&nbsp;right (and actually Hilary Duff actually has talent...yeah). &nbsp;I admit that i used to have an embarassingly close-minded view about pre-marital sex. Thankfully, being in college, getting to know a variety of people, and growing up more in general has ameliorated my former black-and-white view regarding sexuality. Of course it's not always right. But it's not always wrong. The truth is simply that&nbsp;virginity is subjective, sex has its consequences, and whatever you do, make your choices carefully, knowledgably, and responsibly. and don't be so quick to criticize others just because they think differently. While i'm on my soapbox: i've known enough friends/situations/stories to know that premarital sex <EM>can</EM>, in fact, actually be a conscious, well-thought out decision, and i'm sick and tired of people&nbsp;portraying it as nothing but a whimsical&nbsp;inability to control your desires, a&nbsp;sin, or a surrender of moral&nbsp;values. Context and circumstances make all the difference.</P>
<P>Griping about the distribution of free condoms and disapproving of people promoting responsible and safe decision-making&nbsp;aren't exactly things that will rally people to your cause... or even convince them that they're ""immoral"" in the first place. Whatever decisions you make, that's great for you! but don't assign&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;<EM>your </EM>piece of mind. </P>

"event","<P>In a perfect world, we would treat February 14th the same way we treat March 8th, December 4th, July 27th, or June 10th.&nbsp;Why? you ask. I mean, what is&nbsp;significant about those dates?</P>
<P>Exactly. </P>
<P>Until&nbsp;a peaceful February 14th of the future comes, a day&nbsp;in which we all collectively forget to imbue it with any higher significance whatsoever, I will inevitably continue to feel anti-Vday sentiments. Yes yes, I am a hypocrite; shame on me. In feeling antagonism toward it, I am furthering its grip on my world. I should just be indifferent, or better yet, forget it's anything but numbers on a calendar. Somebody please punish me, quick.</P>
<P>How easy to think, Oh Jessica, you're so bitter because you're celebrating Single's Awareness Day. Well, i have the same sentiments toward Mother's and Father's Day; does that mean i'm an orphan? Not at all, in fact, i have great parents and i love them. What i do not love are the manifestations of just how much Hallmark and all the other corporations involved have managed to manipulate the minds and souls of the general populace. It's brilliant advertising: we actually feel <EM>guilty </EM>for not buying a card/fancy dinner/Ipod/vibrator/European tour/house in the Hamptons for our loved ones. We actually get <EM>depressed </EM>when our loved ones don't shower us with lavish gifts that result in month-long starvation in order to appease the Visa/Mastercard/American Express gods. After all, if people fail to buy buy buy whenever Hallmark &amp; Co commands, it must mean they don't truly love you.&nbsp;Money can buy love, don't you know? And if you don't understand this, then you don't know what love is.</P>
<P>It's&nbsp;not a&nbsp;sin&nbsp;for Hallmark &amp; Co. to take advantage of our potential gullibility, insecurity, and narcissism in order to make us buy crap we don't need. But that doesn't mean that we as consumers should allow ourselves to be victimized. Showing love is great, but we can do that whenever we want. Don't most people love spontanaeity anyway? So take Vday and all commercial holidays with a grain of salt. Enjoy them for what they are-&nbsp; commercial holidays; fun at times, but not to be taken to heart. Celebrate if you want, but getting depressed, jealous, feeling obligated,&nbsp;going broke, risking your life, and making a big fucking deal out of a&nbsp;Hallmark Holiday is not advised. It's downright unhealthy and besides, do you really want everyone to know you're bored enough to be obsessing about something this trivial?</P>
<P>I confess:&nbsp;as much as I&nbsp;would love to see Valentine's day disappear off the radar of our cultural consciousness like a traitor in the Soviet Union, i actually kind of&nbsp;like this day. I have a lifelong love affair with the color pink.&nbsp;I find chocolate (especially of the dark variety) irresistable. I get addicted to those cute, pastel-colored, chalky-textured candy hearts. I enjoy sending my friends Vday mail (yeah, so i guess i give in, but i value my friends more than spreading anti-Vday propaganda). It's all in good fun. It's pretty. But it doesn't go beyond that.</P>
<P>So here I am on Single's Awareness Day, it's rainy, cold, and dreary, and I'm happy. Oh no...heaven forbid I enjoy being single on this day and fail to bring about the onset of depression/fear of self-effacement! Nobody loves me! Right. But i do admit, having experienced this singledom 18 out of the 19 Valentine's Days in my life, being single is preferable. No expectations, no headache over dinner reservations, no quixotic notions and/or play-by-play analysis of the (mis)fortunes that this day has in the grand scheme of an entire courtship. (Not that those circumstances shouldn't apply to people who <EM>are</EM> in relationships). Anyway, I'm very happy to be single and yes, it <EM>is </EM>a choice. Reading my journal entry from this day last year (in which i <EM>was </EM>in a serious relationship), i'm glad to see that i felt very much the same then as i do now.</P>
<P>However you spent this Hallmark Field-Day, dear reader, i hope it went well and i hope you are happy. If you're not, however, then you&nbsp;then&nbsp;you can&nbsp;blame only yourself for&nbsp;being lame enough to care too much. </P>"

"event","Was there ever a time in your life when you had basically everything you could reasonably expect to have, when life was great and school was fun?&nbsp; Freshman year in high school was like that for me. I truly woke up every morning and looked forward to school, because no matter what happened, at least i still got&nbsp;interact with such wonderful people. I met so many great people in my classes, but orchestra was really my niche. Through the big scary world of being 'freshmeat,' there were people i could trust, count on, and be happy to see. The&nbsp;upperclassmen sort of took me under their wings, i felt so cool and priveleged and loved to be a first violin in Philharmonic. Jen Cho was section leader, and we always had the craziest funny times in sectionals (ahem...french fries...changing stuff on the comp...busting out random tunes when hudnall walked in...) she always made us laugh so much. Maybe it's just me, but that was the only time it felt like we were a family. We actually did stuff together- homework, sat together at lunch, even went out to&nbsp;movies&nbsp;together. There was such a sense of <STRONG>cameraderie</STRONG> that i really miss.&nbsp;It was also the time i first started becoming passionate about piano (and violin) playing and wanted to be great at it. For once, i actually loved working hard. <STRONG>The Orlando Trip</STRONG>, especially,&nbsp;was a separate peace- 3 days of 100% awesomeness, hours on the bus, crazy fun times, good weather, great rides (&amp; getting soaked multiple times...lol), drama (they ditched us! haha!), and most of all, an incredible bonding experience. i loved every second of it. I'll also never forget the fun we had doing group projects, the endless notes Sara and I wrote to each other, the 'stalking,' the plotting of hallway routes in the old ""ghetto"" NHS, agonizing over crushes,&nbsp;the conversations in which i learned so much. It was a rare time when every day of&nbsp;my ordinary life, i knew I&nbsp;had <EM>everything</EM>&nbsp;i needed- the best friends ever, challenges, goals, hard work, and passion. I can't blame some people for being sad about leaving high school, because if high school were always like my freshman year as i knew it, i'd <EM>never</EM> want to leave it either. I loved being 'part of that world.' I started high school with a bang and&nbsp;I could not ask for a better experience. That year, my eyes were open to worlds of new possibilities and aspirations, but&nbsp;I definitely&nbsp;treasure the <STRONG>friendship</STRONG> the most of all.&nbsp;"

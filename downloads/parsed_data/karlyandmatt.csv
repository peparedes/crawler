"event","Today, I went to Job Shadow at a animal clinic in Fenton.  It was pretty fun, alittle boring but fun.  I got to see 4 surgeries.  They were all spades.  I also got to see a kitty get de-clawed.  I thought the whole experience was pretty neat.  All the people working there were really nice.  I wouldn't mind working in a place like that when I grow up.  

I am pretty excited because our coach called off practice because he wanted to give us a break.  I was pretty pumped about that.  So, I have no homework and The REAL WORLD is on tonight.  I love that show.  I have been looking forward to it for awhile now!!!  

I don't know what I am going to do for the rest of my day.  Since I have no practice and no homework I have a lot of spare time on my hands.  Well, I will talk to ya later!!"

"event","I haven't written in this since Tammy's house!!  I feel so bad that Tammy's grandma passed away.  I wish I could do something.  I Love Ya Tammy!!

We lost our softball game yesterday against Oxford!!  We were supposed to play them on Thursday but it got rained out after the 2nd inning.  Just in those two innings, the score was 6-0 them.  They came back yesterday to finish the games off.  They ended up beating us pretty bad the first game.  It wasn't pretty.  Then, the second game I think we should of won.  We had a few errors...but we were hitting a lot better than the first game.  The funniest thing was, was that the catcher's last name was Anhel, and so we kept calling her Anal.  It was funny stuff.  And I also fell out in the outfield, but I caught the ball.  It was slippery!!

I am so bored right now.  I have nothing to do.  Matt came over yesterday and we rented the movie Hard Ball.  I love that movie...""I Love It When You Call Me Big Papa, Raise Your Hands In the Air If You's A True Player, Cuz I See Some Ladies Tonight That Should Be Havin' My Baby...BABY!""  It is so sad at the end though.

Well, I am getting sick of not doing anything so I am going to find something to do.  
C-Ya!!!!"

"event","Today, I was invited to go over to my best friend Tammy's house because everyone else went to prom.  I got over there a little after 12 and Newman and Katie were still there.  Then, Newman left because she didn't like us anymore and Katie fell asleep.  So, it was Tammy and me left alone on the computer.  We looked through the year book and made fun of a few people.  It was fun.  Now, we are watching this vampire movie and Tammy is scared!! hehe. She is shitting her pants real good, I can even smell it!!!  We were just talking about how fun it was at Mike's house over spring break!!  C-Ya!"

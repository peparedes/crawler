"event","Wow...I haven't really slept in 2 days n I have to get up in about an hour to get ready to go to my girlie's house. School's gunna suck. It doesn't help that it's so damn cold tonight...I can't sleep for crap! 
Things have been running smoothly I guess...but I still get to thinking about Darren, Elijah n Joey. I feel like my thoughts are falling through a bottomless pit and I'm just sittin here screaming, wishing I'd wake up. I guess it could all be the lack of sleep and prolonging hunger I've been sitting through for the past 5 or 6 hours. But i seem to feel this way alot at night. 
Sometimes i'm confused about everything. Like life. I pray there's a heaven. I hope I get to see my good friend up there. I hope I get to see everyone up there. Hell, I'd be happy if it was just a dream of bliss that went on forever. I just feel like life isn't full-filling. Which is one of many reasons I'm glad I'm inlove, because my love helps me to stay strong.

I've been rearranging my room alot lately and I've finally found a way to make it perfect for me. It fits so perfectly, it's almost scary. The only thing missing in it right now is heat, my kitty, and my jacqueline of course. But I'd settle fer some heat I guess. Damn cold weather.
My mom leaves for work at 5am, which isn't too far from now. I'm gettin dropped of at Jackie's, like I usually do for school, but her dad made this lame ass new rule sayin I have to sit in the living room until we're ready for school...so I'll be sitting...doing crap...for like 3 hours. FUCKER! I don't give a shit though, ima climb through her window so I can cuddle with her. Yessssssss.......
My friend Martin is a lucky bastard. He's only goin to skool 2 days out of a week...so not only is he lazy...he;s aloud to be a lazy ass. It's cool though, he;s been workin on some beats lately. I'm so glad he got his turn table. now we can cut some real loops n beats instead of sampling them off of that stupid FruityLoops program.

Well...not much more to say...except I'm hungry n cold. Ima go see if i can get a nice warm bowl of soup er sumthin. make that a hot bowl of soup :-) 

RIP Darren, Elijah, n Joey."

"event","Woke up around 7:30 am after a 4 hour sleep. My mom said she'd take me to Jackie's around 8:00 am - 8:30 am. She never woke up until 9:16 am. Blah! So I made hr coffee and she got ready. 
Before going to Jackie's house, my mom took me to Star Bucks and I got 2 Grande Mocha Frappaccino's. One for Jackie and one for me. 

When I got to Jackie's, I put in the movie I brought over, Secret Window. We watched about half of it and kind of lost interest. I mean, don't get me wrong, the movie is awsome, but we just didn't feel like watching it. 
Jackie got a bunch of Ducky restroom stuff. A ducky theme. So we took everything out of the restroom and both cleaned the whole thing. After the whole cleaning thing...we put up all of the ducky stuff. It looks so awsome! I even added in Jackie's big fury duck doll thing to top it off.

Right now we're just chillin watching Deliver Us From Eva. It's pretty funny. I like it. It's the movie that Jackie picked up yesterday at Walmart. We probably would have gone to Taco Bell to get some grub, but Jackie has an appointment at 3:00 pm and I have teen court at 5:00 pm. Blah! (again)

So ya. The day will most likely end off with me not so happy...(teen court) and with Jackie in slight pain...(Orthadontist). But I don't care! Just as long as I know I have a wubby!

eYeWuBoOo Jackawin!"

"event","My day went by alright. It started off with me waking up at Jackie's house by her loud sister, rumbling through the house, unaware of us sleeping ones. LoL.

Jackie and Lisa kind of just slept in about an hour more than me and I just played on the computer until they both awoke. It was lazy time for about 2-3 hours until we actually got up and decided to do something. We all, Jackie, Lisa, and I, decided to go to the mall. Lisa's mother, the loud one, said that she wasn't aloud to go. So Lisa went home. Jackie and I got ready and decided we needed some money for our little journey to the mall. Jackie heads for the draw with loads of change in it and grabs a dime roll and a nickel roll which equaled out to $7.00. 

We headed for the bus stop and waited for the bus to pick us up. Of course, the SMAT bus that came had to be the smallest of them all. Anyways, we got on and instead of going to the mall, Jackie and I got off near the Star Bucks in Santa Maria and walked over to Jack In The Box. LoL, we had to count out all of the damn change. We sat there for a few minutes couting it all out and eventually got our food. After eating we both went back to the bus stop and took the bus to the mall. 

At the mall we spent 98% of our time in Spencer's. It was pretty fun. Got to look around at cool stuff and we wanted to get some stuff with a five finger discount, but we didn't feel like having to go through that whole process...

OMG! Those damn horny wohawkin bastards were mad staring at Jackie. I was getting pissed. I kept doggin each and everyone of them and was just waiting for one of them to give me a nasty look or to just say something. It would have been on...Mexican Rumble 2004 baby! But it didn't happen and we ended up leaving the mall around 3:20 pm. But before we left, Jackie and I went tot he Cookie Bakery and bought 4 white chocolate cookies. I didn't want any, so I let her grub down on them.

We went to the bus stops in front of the mall and finally got on our bus. The bus goes around Santa Maria and we end up back at the mall. I'm thinking WTF?! But I guess there is a transfer bus that only comes at a certain time and this time around it comes. So we take the bus around Santa Maria, again, get on the small bus again and leave for home! We were so damn tired, holy crap. I thought I was going to pass the f*ck out...

When we got to Jackie's house, I noticed the dishes were clean, yay, and we both went for her bed and just flopped right on it. About 10 minutes later I got the strength to start cleaning and so did Jackie. We both cleaned her room and she cleaned up the bathroom.I decided to hang up a blanket  to part one side of her room fom the other, which turned out awsome. It's much more comfortable and ya. It's just cool. Helps to block out alot of the sunlight and it feels more like you got more privacy. Not that we need any...hehe.

We tried going tot he grad, but my mom was being so lame. I got pissed at her and hung up, so she called back and said she's coming to pick me up and take me home. Blah! I missed my Jackie before I even left...!!! I still miss her right now! *sniff sniff*  ;_;  

Jackie went with her mom to go to walmart to pick up some stuff. She said she got me lots of candy!!! w00t! She also picked up a new theme or whatever for the bathroom. Ducky style...oh yea...so f*cking awsome! I can't wait to see it Jackie! Oh, and she got a new movie. 
Here...read this.
Jackie: lol its a chick flick
Me: tell me....oooo...ooo...I wanna know
Jackie: deliver us from eva
Me: 0_o
Jackie: lol
Me: eh?
Me: lol
Jackie: never heard of it?
Me: nope
Jackie: omg!
Me: who stars in it?
Jackie: with ll cool j
Jackie: and gabrielle union

Ya. So that's the movie she bought. Anyways, I've been watching Secret Window and it turned out to be a really good movie, so I'm bringing that over to Jackie's for the both of us to watch. I'm getting a ride to her house around 8:00 am. Yay! I get to see my beautiful, cute, loving, comforting, lover of mine in her pajamas... ^_^"

I was  playing my gameboy out of bordom, and then my mom comes in nagging about how late it is and told me to turn off everything and go to sleep. So I stubbernly and eventually did as she said and went to sleep. I don't think it was more than 10 minutes when she came back in my room to wake me up to take the trash out! I was like, ""Are you insane woman?"" Then she made some corny joke and gave a small chuckle, as if waking me up after nagging at me to go sleep was just dandy. Exspecially at 3 in the morning. 

So ya. Now I can't sleep because I am freezing. Just thought this small incodent might entertain you. LoL. Anyways, I'm going to try to go back to sleep. In fact, I think I'll add this to my live journal...lol."

"event","Today was harsh. Her mom had told her something afully harsh lastnight and Jackie broke down into tears. I was online and I saw her sign on. She beagn telling me everything and that she needed me badly. I quickly began asking friend's online to find a ride fast so I could get to her house. I had no luck what so ever with that.

I quickly began to think. I remember about my step dad's professional speed bikes and ran to get one. I locked up the house and took off as fast as I could. I had to be going around 25 miles per hour. My legs were burning and it was hard to breath, but I couldn't stop thinking about Jackie...
I got there and nearly passed out. We went inside and relaxed on the couch. I couldn't see clear, everything was a blur. My chest was burning painfully and it really hurt to breath. I tried drinking water, but I could only take in small amounts at a time. 
I remember going to her room. I had to sleep on the side of her bed so that her parents wouldn't see me there in the house. When morning came, her mother came in and saw me sleeping. She left the room, so I got up and put on my sweatshirt and shorts. Her father came in about 5 minutes later asking to talk to me. He began to lay down some rules. What angered me was when he changed his tone to an offensive type and said, ""And don't you ever hang up on me when I am talking to you!"" 
-------------------------------
This happend when i called the other day. Jackie took off for a walk and I had called asking to talk to her. He began yelling at me. So I told him off and hung up. He really had no right to yell at me, so I hung up. Screw that ish. 
------------------------------
He then told me to leave and that I could come back later. SO I took off for about 3-4 hours and chilled at Kaycee's house. Even though no one was there. Jackie woke up, from the nap she had been taking since I left, and I asked if she would like for me to come over. Of course she said yes, so I got on the bike and rushed up there to her house. Her dad was watching us from the window in the front of the house. So I put my bike in the back and we both went inside. Her dad watched us both go to her room. We played some games off of ebaumswrold.com and a few moments later, her mother walks in. I guess she had just gotten back fromt he store or something, but she just began screaming at me asking why I was there. I told her that I was told I could come back later, and now I am back. But now both parents began yelling why I never called for permission. So I'm like wtf? Her mother was yelling so loud. Jackie was just covering herself with my arm. Her mother screamed at me to leave so Jackie tugged on my arm and we both beagn to walk out of the house. I apoligized for everything, but she didn't seem to care at all. I called my mom to come pick me up and Jackie and I both waited outside. 
It wasn't longer than 5 minutes when I heard her mother scream at me to get my bike off of her property. She had made the excuse that my attitude wasn't healthy for her husband because he has a heart condition, even though she was screaming at him as well. I just kept saying sorry. I finally asked why she was being so cruel, but she gave that excuse and walked back in. 
My mom arrived and I put the bike in the back of the truck. Jackie and I had both been crying. She was crying because her parents were being harsh and she just has had enough of all of this madness. I began crying because I felt so damn bad. I didn't want everything we have to go down the drain.
When I got home, I helped my mom put the bike back and I just broke down in tears. I couldn't take it at that point. My mom tried hugging me, but I just kept moving away. I wanted to just be with Jackie. My heart hurt so bad. I have never felt so alone in my life. My love for her was crushing me. I sat in my drive way, whiping tears from my eyes for about 20 minutes. When I went inside, I got online. I signed in to my email and beagn writing a letter to Jackie. Right when I had sent it, she signed on. I told her to check her email. She read it. She told me that I made her day better and that she's happy now.
She may even come over to see me here at my mom's today. SHe has to clean up the house first and then she'll be able to come over here. I'm not sure if her mother will drive her over here though...so I may have to find her a ride. Jackie said she'll just walk, but I wouldn't want her to have to walk that far. If it comes down to that, I'll meet her half way.

I'll get back to the rest of the day later."

We laid up there with her ball and a few pillows for about an hour and a half. (6:30 am).

I saw Kevin and Anthony on my way home because Allen decided to stop at the car wash to clean the Purple Beast. We chit chatted for a bit and after the purple beast was clean, I climbed back into the car and off to my girl toii's casa I went.

Jackie and her madre went to Quizno's, so about 6 minutes after I arrived at her casa, she showed up with some grub. I had never eaten Quizno's Subs, so I was like. ""Woohoo..."" It was really good though. ^_^

Tonight we're going to the fair. So that should be super dooper. My madre gave me $40 to just have. My reaction -----> 0_0

We (Jackie, Lisa, and I) swam for a bit and then they blew the whistle for everyone to get out of the pool. We were like, ""Blah!"" but it was cool cuz we went to go lay out on our little chair things. 

While laying out, we kind of drifted of and fell asleep. So now we all got the meanest tan marks. My ass looks super white...roar. Jackie's donut's are super white now too. LoL! I laugh.
When we got home, Jackie and I crashed out on the bed and listened to her whole family be loud through out the house, because it was Jackie's dad's birthday. He turned 62 today. Jackie says he's 81. Lmao. 
We were bored, so we begged Liz, Jackie's sister, to take us to the chink mart to get us some Lost energy drinks. Yum. Woohoo.

Well, the daily life of me has maintained an equal balance of fun and boredom. I am still living with me beloved Jacquelin and haven't gone home yet. It's been about 2 weeks now! But who cares. I think I'll live here.

Jackie and I had to babysit her sister's kid, whom we think has A.D.H.D x2. It was a f*cking nightmare. $20 each for 2 days was not enough at all. And then Jackie's sister was nice enough to stay, where ever she was, for another damn day. Roar. SO she gave us both $20 more. The first $20 went to alot of food and the movies because we went to go see AnchorMan. It was pretty good. I enjoyed the comedy.

A few days ago, Jackie's other sister, Vicki, took us to the beach. I had so much fun body surfing! It was f*cking awsome man! The waves were killer. The wind blowing all of the sand everywhere was pretty lame, but it's all good. I haven't been to the beach for about 4-5 years and I finally murdered that streak. I missed the beach so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I used to go bugey boarding ALL THE TIME back in the day. Then my mom became a lame cop and ruined my fun life. So blah.

Lastnight we made a quick run to Starbucks, but those a-holes were closed, so we hauled ass to 7-11 and I bought a coffee and a pizza bakery stick. Jackie got a slurpee and alot of candy. So we grubbed down to china town.

THE END. Until next time folks!!!"

Then I went to my video games and entertained myself for a while. After that fun and excitement I called Kaysee and woke her up to ask about the grad, but she didn't know wtf was goin on cuz she was still out of it, so I let her go back to sleepin and then cleaned up my room. I took a shower and got out waitin for Jackie to come over. I couldn't wait any longer so I called her and she answered with a ""What?! I'm almost there. Bye."" 
When she fianlly got at my casa, we chilled in my room for a bit and then took the SMAT to the mall. We went to GameStop and I reserved the new GTA game, then to Orange Julias, and then to that one cookie place downstairs. 
Jackie got hungry so I took her to the Carles Jr. and she grubbed down on some food. We got tired of the mall so Jackie called her madre to take us to her house. 
So now we're here and I am typing this right now. Right at this specific point of time.

"event","Well, I can honestly say that I am glad everything that went to shit because it really has been a wake up call for not only me, but my whole family. 
I now live with my dad in Santa Maria, which is great because we get along much better and we help each other out. He really needs me. He may not say it, but I can tell he does. 
My grandma has been ill with cancer and may die to day or has already died lastnight. We all said our goodbyes yesterday. It was so hard, it hurt, and I just wanted to die from all the confusion and just from everything building up inside. But I can see past all that when I am with my family.

N E Wayz...What happend is I ""ran away"" for a few hours to go see my friends at school when I wasn't supposed to even bea at school. When I got home, my mom and step dad made me pack all my stuff up and made me move in with my dad. I was slightly cheerful, but felt bad because my dad was already going through a hard time with my grandma being ill and all.
My dad drank alot alot alot!!! He was in charge of giving my grandma her medication to help her with her pain and shit and my Uncle Mike was helping out too. BUT my dad was stubbern and they faught constantly. I was always there to force my dad away or beat him to the ground to save my uncle from an ass beating. 
One day my dad got really mad with my grandpa and uncle, thinking they were always against him because he was always drunk, and hit a wall and broke his hand. He went to the hospital, but left and came back home. He took alot of morphine from my grandma's medication box and too viccadin to prevent any pain when he pushed the bone back into his hand. However, after he left our neighbor's house, while we were all alseep, he began to hilucinate and he couldn't walk. He had been drinking to which tripled the amount of the dosage that he took. He became paralyzed and almost died. My uncle found him in the the road and he was shaking. My uncle woke me up and we rushed him to the hospital. I was so scared! He did fine and I guess he never broke his hand, just popped the bone up out of his hand. 
After all of that, I really began to take care of him. He has been so depressed and so have I. I really got to the point of no return. I wanted to just die die die! BUt thank God that I have a girlfriend to think of when I get to that point. 
I recently bean a relationship with Kaycee's best friend, Jakie. We are doing great and I love her! I really haven't seen any of my friends at all because I am always with Kaycee or Jakie. And now Kaycee is going out with Petey so I am really happy to see her happy :)
My dad is so awsome. I work around the house and I can actually leave to go do stuff. And since I live next to the mall, I go there often.
WHile at the hospital to see my grandma, I finally got to see my favorite cousin, Michael. I look up to that guy. Really cool. So I'm going to hit him up so we can chill sometime.

Today I am going straight home to go see if my grandma made it. She is so strong. She was supposed to pass away along time ago and the doctors can't believe how long she has hung in there for. I'm sad to say this, but her being in this condition has really brought everyone together for the first time. I felt so happy to see my dad hug my grandpa. They have never been so...well, they just have never expressed love to eachother like that.
I'm going to try to go see Jakie today if I get the chance. I miss her and it's only been 2 frikin dayz! 

The finals that we are taking in school really suck. I don't know ish! Except right now in Ag Bio, the test was patheticly easy, so I am happy.
LoL at Kaycee!!!! Her dad went off on her because she had my notebook and it had ""Fuck the dumb"" written on it. Josh and I couldn't help but to laugh. I cheered her up and made her go to class. PLus I fianlly paid her back, which helped with her bad mood to go away.

Hmmm...I'll edit this to add more later. Keep on checking to see if I have done it yet.

Talk to yall laterz,

 I am so busted...I may not ever return to Reghetti and may have to go to Delta. Which I wouldn't mind going to becuz my friend Martin goes there. But fuck though...all my friends go to Reghetto...

I am so depressed right now...I've been drinin a bit and tried drinkin myself to death, but I guess that didn't work out :(
All I could think about was if Kaycee was ok and if I was going to get fuked over. I think I won't be able to see my friends again cuz of it. I can't take it anymore...it sux. And it was Via who caught me, that bastard...So I'm suspended for about 5 days and I have an exspolsion meeting coming up. Life  sux right now, so I could care less...

I'm a little out of it right now and I don't know what to do anymore.




Today was ok until that incodent. I was happy to have given that b-day card to Michelle's frined to give to her. My friend's told me not to give it to her, but I wanted to. I don't see why it would be such a big deal if I did.

My friendz all know bout today...and becuz of today, I can't do anything this weekend with anyone...so I'm even more depressed. I was supposed to go see my dad and spend time with him, but my mom seems to think it wouldn't be a good idea. So I may have to wait a while to see him...but it has already been a while since I habve seen him. Plus my grandma and grandpa are both dieing...and it makes me so sad.

I tried talking to Kaycee, but she won't talk to me...fuck. I want to just cry myself to sleep, but I can't sleep cuz of the pain. Why the hell did this all happen... :( Oh my god...

Obviously I don;t do that much, which is what excited me.

Frikin Kevin was wearin a damn speedo...like wtf...lol.
When Kaycee went to jump up on my back the first time, I guess she jumped to fast and her whole top came down, lol. She jumped off my back all quick and landed in the water. At first i thought she just fell, but I was thinkin she was gunna hit the edge. So I turned all quick and saw the unexpected. 0_0 We were laughin so hard. Frikin Kevin had a straight on view!

We basicly chilled in the jacuzzi, but me and a few other people kept jumpin in the pool. Eventually everyone got in. But Jackie was just chillin on duh sidelinez! I guess she had contacts in, but still...I wish she had more fun. I was going to try to conversate with her, but I pussied out! lol. 

Krystina's bf is a weird ass mo fo. He;s so quiet, and I think he's from.....I dunno, but out of town. They were all kissin next to me and I felt so uncomfortable because...well, I just have known her for a long long ass time and it's just...odd to see her kissin some dude. BUT! I'm glad she's happy. Even though she's with some weird guy! lol.

I got a ride home from kaycee's dad and had to climb up onto my 13 ft roof and then enter through my window. Right when I was actually in, my mom just opened up my door. Now I'm still feelin that alky, and my eyes were blood red, but from the chlorine. But you can guess wut my madre was thinkin...lol.
She told me straight up that she was taking my comp, my tv, and that I was grounded. I agreed with her and left it at that. Then I started talkin with kaycee and she was tellin me some stuff that pisse me off so I socked my wall! My step dad came in all yellin and eventually called the cops. Chatted with kaycee a bit more and they finally showed up. I was so scared that I would get arrested, but I didn't, so i was happy. 
When they were talking with my mom and gay ass step dad, I booked it up to my room to tell Kaycee what was goin on. Then one of the cops came up stairs like superman status and told me to not move. I tried shuttin down the chat window I had opened with Kaycee, but her read a lil bit of it. Didn't think much of it since I was usin my teen slang wordz...lol.

After that we kept chattin and kept mentioning that we wanted to crash out cuz we're tired, but always kept conitnuin with the convo! We finally eneded the convo and she crashed out. Now I am typing this....yes...right now. lol. But I am so tired so Ima crash out on my cumfy futon with my body pillows and soft blanketz...mmm....cumfy. lol

Until next time...."

"event","Wahla. Another magical day in Orcutt. The most ""fun"" town on earth...NOT! lol, but it was a decent day.

Started off with almost being late to the bus and ended up with another amazingly slow day. None of my friend's, except for Anthony, showed up this morning. Which is unusual because Anthony for one, is never at school on time. It's either kevin or Martin and Martin goes to Delta now so, ya. I guess that chick and Anthony aren't even really hangin with each other anymore...so now I think it's my fault for that one. Damn, I can't believe I frikin did that.
Becky finally started talking to me again today, cuz she was mad before. But I guess now Kaycee's pissed of cuz Becky was huggin Neil (the guy Kaycee loves...i think) right in front of Kaycee. She was all upset and cryin...which made me feel like shit. I wanted to just fall over dead when I saw her hurt like that.

I don't think I did a damn thing in any one of my classes today. I just listened to my MD player and drew. I have all the homework written down, so I have to get on that later tonight. The test I had in History was a killer. I barely knew anything on it. I felt like a dumbass when I turned it in with half the answers down...which were probably all wrong anyways, but hey, it was worth a try.

LoL, during the passing period between the end of 2nd period and the beginning of 3rd period, I was just walking with Kaycee. Went with her to her class, since it was near my locker. Then the bell rang and she went inside and I just stood there. She tried making me go to class, which was too successful. Then she went inside again. So then after a while I cruised over to her locker and grabbed a couple of my shirts that were in there and there she was walking towards me to grab her book out her locker. LoL, she was all yellin at me to go to class and a teacher was like, ""Wow."" He was makin fun of me too. But I can't remember what the hell he said...
So I was about 20 minutes late to class today...

I guess these two guys I know got in a fight today at lunch. One of them hit the other and broke his whole nose in. Had to go to the hospital I think. The guy who hit the other guy, has cops looking for him, if they haven't already caught him. Some chick called the cops when she saw the fight. It was a gory little fight. I thought it was fucked up how he just hit him once and went for the nose. Pussy fight, but then again, fights are lame. You just get caught up in them sometimes...

After school I took the bus home and I got off my bus to start walking home. That Manuel guy was going to throw some more paper at me at the bus driver caught him. He called me a pussy so I fuckin went off on him. I think he's gunna want to fight now, but I may just kill him with kindness. I may get called a pussy for it, but fuck him. I already know I would woop him. Short lil stalky bastard...lol.

So now I am home just screwing around with everything online. Bored! 

See yuh laters, gotsta find fun!"

"event","Damn...today I felt so bad. Not knowing it, I snatched the chick that Anthony was all over. Her and I just started talking and she just basicly ignored Anthony after lunch when we were walking to school. Kevin was the one to point it out. He told me and then I thought about it and I was like $^#%$#&^$%#^%$ MYSELF for doint that. Anthony said he was cool with it, he didn't care. He actually said, ""Good for you"". I still felt bad. I think I'm going to ignore her a bit so this doesn't continue. I had no clue I was doing that. Damn I'm a dick...

School went ok. Becky is so damn pissed at me because of what happend with Kaycee and that whole situation, which I'm not going to get into...
She doesn't have much of any reason to be angry at me, but whatever. She's being dumb. 
Kaycee was fun today. Like she wasn't sad at all and was in a good mood. I hope to see more of that coming from her. She got new shoes that look...cumfy...kinda....well they don't look cumfy really, but they're stylish. They're those high heel type of shoes. 

I am so fuckin happy that Memorial weekend is coming up. Not only is it going to be a 3 day weekend, but there are going to be parties all over. My dad is planning to go camping at Lopez cuz we got the trailer to kick it in. Although I may just be out and about in his truck looking for some females who want to go have a fun time. I am planning to bring some of my friend's, but not sure what's going on yet. I haven't really talked to my dad fer a lil while. I'm going to call him sometime later this week and get the plans down.

After school today, I left for my locker, which is on the other side of the school from where my bus departs. So I decided to just cruise over to martin's house and just chill there 'til I had to leave for the 7th period bus. When I got there, no one was home, but his window was open. So I climbed onto his roof and went through his window. I grubbed down on some food and watched a little bit of tv. That time came around so I headed out the door and then Martin pulls up on his bike. We chatted a bit and I left for the bus. 
I plan to go to his house today. I just may need a ride there because that would be the only way for me to get over there.

Last friday was pretty cool. I guess. That night, I chatted with Kaycee's friend jackie and she told me to just go over there. We've never met in person before, but I was bored and said fuck it. (This was all around 9 - 10 pm) I got ready and left...on foot! I had to have had walked about 2 or more miles from my house to her neighboor hood. I couldn't really remember the address, so I walked over to Martin's house. I threw a rock at his window and he woke up. I went inside and looked at the clock. It said it was about 11:30 pm. Frikin late and on my way there I was actually ran from this cop who was tryin to stop me fer curfew. ANYWAYz......I called Jackie and got the info and then cruised over there. I had to sneek in through her window so her dad didn't se me or anything. Jackie's two neices were over and they were all just chillin and watching tv. I was a little shy, but very quickly began to conversate with them three. It was an alright time. I was so tired though and I guess I passed the hell out. 
I woke up and it was around 8 am and Jackie told me I had to leave before her dad came in. So as I was leaving I hear someone say, ""Wait right there!"". What was going through my mind was...RUN DAMNIT! RUN!. But my brain actually began to work and I thought it would only make things worse if I just booked it out her backyard. Her mom and dad had a mean ol' discussion about hwy I was over there and just lots of anger was goin on...lol. I didn't really care, not like they knew me well or could do anything to me. So i just basicly zoned out and listened. After that whole deal,  I walked back home...long wayz....

On Saturday, Anthony came over and we skated my rail and chilled. I jacked a bottle of C & J and we downed that. We got so fucked up! Holy crap, I could barely walk. Plus I downed a few beers as well. We watched the Patriot and then passed out all late. The next morning, Sunday, we woke up and ate. He went home and I made him take the rest of the alky, in that bottle, home. I just took a shower and got all cleaned up. A few hours later, I got a ride to Martin's house. He was all fucked up again, because I guess he drank the rest of that bottle. Anthony was over there too. We all had like $5 each and we wanted some TallBoys. I hit up my bro and he ahd the hook up on a 12 pack of Steel Reserve. Holy crap that's some nasty ass beer. But it got us phaded. I left for home around 8:30 pm. Woke up the next morning at left for school...
And that was my weekend.

I think nextweekd should be great. Party!"

"event","Today was actually a good day. Nothing bad really happend, except for this lame ass who ""threatened"" me. He said he was going to beat my ass the next time he saw me out of school. I am waiting for that time to come....lol. 

School was cool. My first period spanish teacher wasn't here today so I didn't have to hear anything from him about the other day. All my friend's were at school today, except for martin, of course. The rest of the school day was just some easy time that went buy slow...but it was easy, which made up for how slow it was. I basicly got free lunch today because everyone was giving me money and food. I was so happy that everyone had extra change and food. It was a feast!
I was late to my 5th period today because Randy was laggin and kevin, Nick, Anthony and I were all waiting, after our lunch was over, at Nick's house. It wasn't so bad though. the guy renting out the front room at Nick's house was playing some b-ball with us all. That guy has hops! Out of no where he does a 360 one hand dunk on Nick's high ass b-ball hoop. I mean, I was able to dunk on it, but there was no way in hell that I could throw in a damn 360. He was almost arrested today for violation of parol, but the judge dropped the charges, which was cool, cuz he's a cool guy.
When we got to school, Nick, Randy and I all had 3 on 3 basketball (PE class) and Mr. Jimenez marked us all late. Randy and Nick went out the back door int he back of the gym to go grab a drink from the vending machine. Mr Jimenez saw them and waitinf for them to come back. When they did come back, Mr. J told them he marked them absent, so they just left and went to nick's house. So I was stuck in pe with barely anyone I knew. I had fun playing basketball though.

After school, I took the bus home with the office pass I had. I went straight to my room and plopped onto my futon. 
About an hour later, Martin hit me up and wanted to come over and chill, which I didn't mind at all. It's about time I heard from him, lazy bastard. Anyways, he came over and we skated my huge rail. I was bustin out all kinds!!! Learned like 5 or 6 new tricks that I can't wait to try on some SLO rails the next time I go up there. Martin was kind of out of it, so he didn't skate as good as he usually does. That guy is so good at switch ups, it's crazy.
After a long seesion of skating, we both went back up into my room and I put in Scary Movie 3. That movie was so funny! LoL, it was funny pretty much through out the whole movie. We grubbed on some microwavable burritos whikle watching the movie.
Martin brought over his cd's so I could burn them. So I got some new cd's and plus I am burning some more cd's from all of the songs I've downloaded so far.

My room is so much better now that I moved it all around. There is alot more space now and it looks cool. I think I may need to go buy some posters to put up on my empty wall. Since the other walls are filled with skate pics and cd booklets. I tend to get bored often so I like to hang sh*t up on my walls. I might have to go out of town to pick up so cool posters. I haven't really seen any good posters here in town, but I may get lucky and find some at a local cd store or something. 

I still can't find my ID, which sucks because that's the only way to and from school for me. My mom finally gave me $5 to go get a new one, but the problem is is that I have to have the ID to get to school. And in order to get the ID, I have to be at school. So you can see the conflict that I am trying to work out. I am praying my bro will bum me a ride to school because if I have to ask my mom, she will crusify my for waking her up! I may just have to walk like 2 miles to school. Yay...(sarcasim) And Martin doesn't have to worry about gettin to school on time since he doesn't have to leave until like 12 pm!

"event","I stayed up pretty late last night downloading a crap load of songs because i was bored and I figured I could waist some useless time on that.

School was pretty basic today. Nothing really intersting happend today. Frikin Anthony got to sleep all day, but i don't know if he was sick or just lazy as usual. Either way he's a lucky lil bastard to have been able to stay home.

In my first period, Spanish, I sat down and opened my math book. My teacher began b8tching at me to stop doing math work, which I wasn't. I was just putting my papers into my binder. He was a real dick and finally told me to just leave and don't come back. Ask anyone in my class, he had like a 9 foot pole up his ass today.
Anyways...security was all searching for me so I booked it to the other side of the school and chilled by the welding shop. Since there was nothig else to do, I finished my math work and waitind for the period to end.

I went to Nick's for lunch today. We chilled, listened to music and ate some little chicken tosquiots (or however you spell it). they were so damn good. Randy gave Nick, kevin and I to nick's house, so we didn't have to walk for days to get there.

After school had just ended, I had to go to the office and get a bus pass because I lost my school I.D. This really sucked because not only had I lost my id, I had to wait to take the 7th period bus which took forever! I finally walked over to Nick's and watched some of the movie Torque. I took the bus home and helped my mom move some of the gorilla hair stuff around in the yard. it's this stuff that you add to make it all look nice. Like wood chips, but not. It's gorilla hair. lol.

Still waiting to go see jackie, since i still haven't seen her in person yet. I want to go chill with Kaycee and Jackie during my lunch sometime, that would be cool.

Well, that's it and now I'm back to being bored."

Started off slow and went even slower through out the day. 
Frikin Anthony is ALWAYS late to school. I think kevin and I are going to show up at his house tommorrow morning and wake his ass up for school. We just got to watch out for his cracked out, psycatic dad who is mentally insane. I'm going to beat his dad down one day. I know it's comin...lol

School was cool. I guess. Just loads and loads of work. Mr. Plante (history teacher) was so funny when he was yelling at the class. That guy is my fav. teacher. So great. He's like a pothead teacher and always where's the coolest clothes. LoL, he calls me ""The guardian"" because of my last name. has the word ""guard"" in it, so ya.

I lost my I.D. so i couldn't take the bus home today, and I still can't find it! I'm so screwed if i don't find it by tommorrow morning, cuz I can't take the bus and my mom flips out about the little things in life. I'll just photo copy my sisters I.D. and paste a pic of me on there. lol, it should work out fine ;)

I finally saw Kaycee after decades of her not bein at school. It actually was so cool to see her. I miss you friend!!! 
She was gettin her P.E. stuff from her locker. She had to be escorted to the Gym because she can't be down there. She got in a fight and is leaning over the edge of gettin expelled. I've been helpin her out by gettin assignments so she can come right on back to skool. She better!

My mom picked me up from school, which I was glad, I almost had to walk home today. That would have took me a few hours, but hey, it's all good.
When i got home my mom heated me up some pozole and I cooked up some tortillas to go along with my delecious pozole. I devoured that and went up to my room and just startin downloadin loads of songs. my mom asked me to download some Lynard Skynard, so I did. I like most of it, but some of the songs I don't really care for. 
After a few hours of sitting around, I decicided to move my whole room around. It was entertaining and now my room is spotless! I vacuumed, dusted, scrubbed, and vacuumed again and again! My room was a damn dump! It looks all cool now. I think this could be the new chill spot...when my madre and gay ass step dad aren't home.

oh! My mom mentioned that she found a beer bottle cap in my room and got all serious and said, ""Why was there a beer bottle cap in your room? Are you drinking my beer? Don't lie to me?! If you drank it, you drank it, but don't you lie to me.""
I could tell she was already pissed off, so I denied everything. As always...
Even though I've drank like 90% of the beers she buys. What gets me is that I can drink all of those beers and she doesn't notice, but when there is a little beer cap lieing on my desk, she freaks out! Aw well, it happens.

Lately I have been chattin with kaycee's friend, Jackie. She's so cool. We haven't met in person yet, but I hope to see her tommorrow after school. She said she should be home,b ut I'll call her cell to make sure, I don't even knw which house is hers! lol, good luck to me to finding where she lives. All i know is it is near the school somewhere. Ya.

I think that's all. I'm just going to be chillin here in my room blarin my music and eatin and eating and eating. Fun fun fun! Catch yuh laters!

So we all kind of took a glance at it and the guy was flipping us all off. He then tells us to meet him down the road accross the inter section. He started talking crap and said he would beat our asses. We all laughed and he called us all pussies and took off in his loud truck. 

School was cool. I wrote a lil gay poem in Spanish and in my other classes I just wrote stuff and drew, after my calss work was done of course ;)
Yay! Michelle said hi yesterday and today! I was happy. It's a working progress...

Haven't seen Martin since last weekend. It sux havin him goin to Delta, but he enjoys the less hours of having to attend school. Things always felt so weird without havin him at school, cuz he was the only person i would really go to chat to and everyone else would jusyt show up. Now I search for either Kevin, Anthony, or Randy.

After school today i went to the grociery store with my mom. We bought so much damn food it's unreal...I couldn't believe how much food we got! I'll never go hungry again! Muha ha ha ha ha ha!!! lol Then while we closed the garage door and were taking the food out of the trunk to bring inside the house, the garage door began opening. My sister got a ride home from her friend Kara which my mom doesn't want happening cuz my sis has been gettin in so much damn trouble with kara it's annoying to me cuz I have to hear my mom yell at her. So ya, that was a nice little yell out seesion from mi madre.

Today today today...
Today I decided to quit smoking. My friend Martin talked to me about how he was quitting a few days ago and Michelle mentioned that I should quit, So I am. We all benefit from it so I just dropped it. I'm going to go celebrate with a bottle of Souther Comfort ;)

It's about time I got a damn hair cut, my hair was turning into wooly mamoth style. It may have not looked like it, but woah...it was.
My mom picked me up after school today, but I ha to wait in the car with her forever because my sister had to run to her class room to grab her history book, which she couldn't accomplish because the class room was locked. So my mom went off on her like half of the way to my sister's dentist appointment. We got my hair cut right after that.

Basicly all today I just drew and wrote notes back and forth to some of the girls in my classes. It was entertaining so I had some what of a good time. Girls have so much to say! Holy crap, i was running out of things to conversate about. Like 50 page notes going back and forth. LoL, not one of my teachers cared about it. 

In P.E. I played some basketball, after all I am in the 3 on 3 basketball class. After that was over with, Randy and I were leaving the way we usually leave, out the back way. Manuel, the TA, told us to go the way we're supposed to, so we did, until we got outside. Randy and i just started walking towards the girl's locker room to go around the Gym and to our lockers. But no, manuel started bitching about that, so we just went around the other way of the Gym, which made have to walk further to our destination. After that, I couldn't care less if manuel said anything, he was pissing me off. 

ShotGun! Ha ha! (Inside joke used towards Nick)

My mom has been trying to get me to study for my history class, but she thinks I need to study out of my book. I told her that we barely use our books for that class and that I have a crap load of notes through out of the year that i could study off of.
This morning my step dad jumped into the little arguement my mom and i were having and he tried to tell me to bring my book home, saying it like a smart ass. I told himt he same thing i told my mom and he got up and walked towards me kind of yelling. He was nagging and nagging and through out that whole period of time, i was thinking of what I should do to shut him up. He finally nudged my shoulder with his hand and i swung as hard as I could to hit him. He swung the bedroom door shut and i hit the door. My mom got so pissed cuz I cracked the door on the side, but that was the last thing I even wanted to hear after that whole situation. 

But after all that and I was actually at school, my day got better.
Now I am just going to chill here in my room on my cumfy futon eating and eating. 

I think that was my day, so I'll get back to yuh with life tommorrow or when ever.

I was hoping Kevin brought my back pack to school this morning, which he did. I left it over at his house that night I crashed out ont he weekend. Umm...school was the average day, besides the hurricane death weather. I saw Michelle, still same situation. I had a conversation in each class through out ever minute of each period. I had no work in most of my classes so everyone just started talking.
Nick was being a fag as always so I gave him a hard time to day. It was so damn hilrious! Everyone was just busting up about it all. This was at lunch. 

After school Kevin, Anthony, and I cruised over to Anthony's to steal a bottle. Kevin had a bottle of his own in his pack. After Anthony jacked that bottle, we cruised on over to Martin's house. Even though he wasn't home, we started drinking in there. He came home and it was all good cuz I go watch tv in is room when he isn't even home. He eventually came home and I was going to be late to the bus, so I booked it to the busses. I made it there in no time. Rode that giant twinky mobile home, that was an adventure.

We got a ride on the way to Nicks house and so we dropped Nick off over there while Kevin, Anthony and I cruised over to Kevin's old house. We chilled there and I got to talk to Tom for a bit. 
lol, Kevin kept shooting his pellet gun at the fence and the neighbor starting yelling at us. Anthony and I were about to go shut him up unitl Kevin told us that he didn't want any trouble to go happen because Tom will go crazy. Tom's a huge guy, so what kevin said sunk in pretty well.
I can't really remember, but some how we got to the show over at higher groundz, which was not so great. We stayed there until the end, but didn't watch the whole show. Randy gave us all rides back to where we were all staying, so that was cool.
I went over to Lee's house and kicked it there. We drank quite a bit and conversated for dayyyyzzzz....
I went back to Kevin's house to crash out and that I did. 

.........

Woke up and I don't want to say what we all laughed at that morning, but it was pretty funny.
It was Saturday, which meant Tom's little daughter was having her birthday party over at Waller park. Took Tom forever to get all of the shit ready for the b-day, lol.  He was gettin all stressed out. So Ima skip a couple hours.
Now we're all at the birthday party, and people are showing up slowly. Kevin saw Martin off in the distance. Martin was having a lil family party right next to us! I said wut up to him and he was happy to see all of his buddies chillin at an awsome lil b-day party with lots of grub to grub on.

omg...there was this chick from over at Martin's lil family thing and she was so damn hott. After a while...a long while, I finally spoke to her. She wouldn't tell me how old she was, what grade she was in or basicly nothing else besides her name and what school she went to. I found out all of the other info from Martin's mom. This hott girl was only 14, she looked 17, and her dad is a Pasture at a church! So it all made sense why she wouldn't tell me much, but hey, it's all good. 
There was this other cutie who was from Germany. She is a foreign excahnge student who was only in California for a very short time. Her name was Sarah, great personality, and did not want to leave CALI! But she did, and I think she's on a plane right now as I type this. We exchanged screen names and so I await for her to sign on. 

The bounce house over at the birthday party lost electricity or something for the generator and it all caved in, lol!!!!!! All of the lil kids were like screaming bloody murder, but like it was the most harmless thing I have ever seen lil kids scream over. 

I bummed a ride home after it all and so now I am just waiting for alot of food and maybe some friends to come over today. My mom got my grades so that wasn't too awsome at all. Screw it though, it my weekend! lol, Talk to you all laters.

FUCK YOU KEVIN!  YOU SICK BASTARD! YOU TOO ANTHONY! lol."

"event","I got a ride to school finally! I asked my bro if I could bum a ride to school and he said to be ready in 5 so I threw my stuff together and ran down stairs. Well, half way down the stairs I rolled, but let's not get into that little disaster. 

School was cool. Basicly I just listend to my moozik and walked around aimlessly...
Today felt different from most days, it actually felt like I wasn't at school today.
Still no Martin. I haven't seen him since Monday, which is odd because I used to see that guy ever day...he's ""the"" friend I hang out with, so I'm a little mad about that. 
Later on today I may go hang out with Randy, he said he wanted to go do somethin after his 7th period, so I got to call that funny mo fo and see whats on the agenda for today. Hopefully we can cruise over to martin's dump to just chill, but I think he's still in school. Damn Delta. 

And wow, Michelle! She's still not up for the chit chat deal. :( 
Jee golly, if only she would talk to ME. *hint hint* I don't feel special anymore. :(



Well, that's all folks! LoL. Not much of and entry, but that's the best stuff I could think of to put down out of today. Bite me already!

Woo hoo! I got an ice cream. ^_^ That just topped off this day."

"event","Today felt like the average day. Or should I say, a normal day. The average day sucks. It got pretty warm out so I was happy about that.
LoL at Anthony, he said he didn't recognize me at all today. I had no problem recognizing me at all!
Nick was being the same ol' dick. So I wasn't surprised when Kevin and I started talking behind his back. He has too much of a smart ass problem, but hey, thats Nick.

This morning I had to go get my math book from Martin's house and so I journied my way over to his dump and picked up my book. Almost got hit my some careless person who made a sharp turn going like 50 when I was trying to cross the street. I saw Michelle get dropped off and caught up with her and shared small talk and then went over to Kevin who was waiting for my return. Then off to class and the school day had begun.

Ha ha! When kevin and I were walking to get a donut today in the morning, we happend to be behind Kelly. But that's not where ""the"" part comes in...
I mentioned she looked good today and Kevin agreed and then we carry on with what we were talking about previously. We finally reach the booth to buy a donut and my atention was stolen by some peeps being loud.
Right when we began to leave, Kevin tells me that Kelly was staring at me and making a fist. I was like ""What!"" So I don't know if she likes me as a person...

I think my mini disc player made the day alot better. Without the music I would have gone nuts in some of my periods. I was bummed out that i left most of my mini discs at home and my batteries were low. I just lstened to some Eligh and turned that off because I listend to that too much. I popped in the other disc which was my lil rock mix. It had some Rob Zombie, Incubus and Slip Knot tracks on it so I got to blare that most of the day. Thank you Kenny for lettin me borrow your Rob Zombie cd to upload them tracks on my MD player! Forgot to thank you for that one!

I think that was it...

Later!"

"event","Today started off pretty gay and ended up awsome. After school today I got to go shopping for some new clothing. Lots of new clothes! I usually get a bunch of thugged out sh*t, but lately it's been annoying me. My mom and I first went over to TJ Max, but didn't have too much luck, we only found a few shirts there and then left. We then headed over to WalMart to go looka round in there and of course they have loads and loads of clothing in there. So I grabbed some pants and shirts from there and booked it out the store to go to One Way. There I picked up some shorts, shirts, and shoes. I also got a new belt! 
My mom must have spent over $300 today. So we just topped it off with a number 1 at McDonalds and called it a day.

My friend Martin hasn't started Delta just yet I guess. Today he just went to a meeting so the school could tell him where in the hell he needs to go when he does actually start. It licks ass that he has to go to Delta because that's my best friend and it aint a day without the guy. 

I guess the rest of this day will be dedicated to chatting and palyin some video games to by pass the time. See you laters..."

"event","Holy crap, it is so damn hot out today. 
Yesterday I was stuck home basicly all day and it really sucked. So I called Anthony B. to see if he wanted to go to a show. I guess it was a heavy metal show or something similar to that, so I thought I'd go. Stan and Michelle went and Stan wanted to meet me, which was also why i wanted to go, but I didn't want to go alone. Would have been a tad bit boring without a friend. At the last miinute Anthony backed out, so I ended up not going and just went to his house instead.
I guess this freshman Ricky wanted to box Daniel Bailey, so it all went down in the living room for a little bit. Ricky was getting slugged on and almost broke the sliding glass window. So we moved the little fight outside. About 1 minute into the match and the owner of the apartements drives right by and stops to get out. She instantly begans yelling at us so we all went inside the house. Anthony got lectured! Ha ha! Not just once, but twice. The lady was threatening to evict Anthony if any other problems occurred and said that if Ricky is ever found on her property, she will call the cops to have him arrested for trespassing. 
All and all the whole situation was pretty wild.
After all of that, it was Anthony, Daniel, and me. It was getting dark out and Anthony didn't want to be there when his dad got back so we jammed over to Martin's house and chilled there. I got to see Curtis (Martin's bro) who I haven't seen forever! He offered my a cig and we were just watching some Cypress Hill video where it shows a bunch of music videos and concerts. We blazed a couple bowls and after that we tried to get the hook up for some 40's. No luck with that one, I guess the guy got lazy...

Today is hot as hell. I took a long cold shower and am eating ice cream. My room is sufficating me slowly. Most of the day was just spent over at martin's, waiting for a ride to my house. My step dad lags so damn much. I'm just glad to finally be home.
I think I may just pass out and get some rest, that is after some quality time chatting with some peeps online.

Tommorrow is going to be kind of gay because martin will be going to Delta from now on. I got one more reason to hate school now. I just hope Michelle will actually stop to chat for a minute at least. She ignores me, just doesn't admit it. I think anyways... 

See yuh laters,

Ryan"

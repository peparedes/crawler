"event","Well today,I'm doing alot better. Me and the kids are getting along good even w/out Nigel.I have my mind on going on w/my life. After asking Nigel desperately to come home.Which he actually said no.Hes happy w/his girlfriend and is in love w/her. I am finally accepting this as the way things are. I am actually letting go of Nigel. Me and the kids are better off w/out him. I'm just glad my heart is finally slowly but surely coming back together. Losing Nigel was the hardest thing I have ever had to cope w/.And the worse pain I have ever felt. I almost would have rather had died. But as I said in my title,Life does go on...I am becoming more confident,more secure,and more happy,and so are the kids.I am actually living my life w/out Nigel? I didn't think that was possible...? I guess in a wierd way I need to Thank him for letting me go.....????? Does that make sense?"

I'm doing better,but it still hurts like hell. Why do i care? Why do i still love him? God knows i wish i could get him out of my heart and out of my head. He just called and we talked,and argued,he cussed,fussed,and i cried.I hate this.I hate being alone. I hate being separated.I hate like hell that my marriage to Nigel is no longer...I loved him,and he never knew how much.I still love him,i wish to God i didn't.I have never felt such deep pain or rejection,like i do now.I know it will get easier. But for right now i'm tired of hurting.What hurts the most,is that Nigel is happy now. Don't get me wrong because him being happy, i am glad.Its just I wish I could have made him happy.I wish he could be happy w/me. But its a little too late now. That is what hurts.So another day of being a single mom,trying to put on a smile.Got to be Ms.Happy Carefree Vickie. Yep that's me.."

"event","Well I don't even know where to start...I'm heartbroken,stressed and extremly depressed...Nigel is happy though I know cause he is telling everyone he is.Its been a little over a week since hes been gone,and as much hate as i have towards him,i miss him dearly. I loved him more than i have ever loved anyone and after being married for 7 1/2 yrs,he just stops loving me,and forgets me like i never meant shit to him...It hurts soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad,more than i ever have hurt in my life.I am just so confused. How can he just give up on us,and move on like i never meant anything to him???How could anyone do that?I try to be strong,i try to hold back the  tears,but my heart hurts so bad.He is in Florida now living w/strangers that he calls friends.His birthday was yesterday,and he said he had a good one. How is that possible? Does he just not have a heart? He spent his bday with people he barely knows,instead of here w/people who love him,and he says he had a good birthday...?  Sorry,excuse my language,but what the fuck?I guess he just never loved me. I think he just always was in love w/hiself.Its really sad i almost feel sorry for him.He just is clueless of what he has  done,what he has lost.But oneday,oneday,he will realize it,and I will be over him."

Nigel is leaving me again,he tried to lie to me and tell me he was going to a poker tournament to make money in Alabama.Because as usual we are in a bunch of crap.We are about to get evicted,and lights are about to be cut off.So Nigel decides to lie about a bunch of crap.He says hes going to meet a 40yr old lady and only go out to eat and shopping and to a awards ceremony.Bullshit. How stupid does he think i am.He says he is doing exactly that and nothing sexual or whatever and says the woman and her husband are paying him $1600.00? Yeah right!He is morally screwed up.He kept me up all nite last nite cussing me out,he threw a computer monitor on the floor off the computer desk and broke it. Then he grabbed me around the neck twice. Then he says today that I should respect him for being the only person whos going to bail me out of this. Excuse me? I should respect him after all that? So im now at my sisters scared to go home.Hes acting crazy,hes threatened to have his family take my kids away.? I don't know who he is.....But I do know he has royally crushed my heart for the last time,and screwed me for the last time...He says hes coming back Sunday to pay the bills and then we are separated for the last time. He is so confused he don't know what he is doing anymore."

He said that was the least he could do since his dog killed my sweet Sisco(pekingese).So I am happy now.Today was more progressive. We got some things done around the house.We got Kevin and Nicks room done and Justins almost done! Yeah! Now we got to finish our own room...fun.Nigel is thinking about switching jobs again.Which can't really blame him. Cause hes not making crap,where hes at.But anyway,thats pretty much it. Oh,my sister Cherie is pregnant with her third child.Glad its her and not me!Nigels sister Mitzi had her baby about 2 months ago,or something like that. That is one rich spoiled rotten boy.Not surprising huh? Ok gotta go.Take Care and God Bless!"

"event","Well hi. Lets see,whats new? Well Nigels big pitt bull killed my $300 pekingese.Fucked up,right? That reaaally sucked. I cried.And still are really pissed.I loved that dog(Sisco,was his name)When Nigel found out,he was mad as hell,and was going to kill him with a metal bat! But I told him not to,cause I didn't want another dead dog.I have too much heart when it comes to animals.But I still hate that son of a bitch for killing Sisco,so Nigel and I agree he is gone. We are taking him somewhere or giving him to someone. But that asshole is not living on my property.!.Anyway,we have completely moved our stuff here to the new house. But are already late on the first payment. Fun times! Let me tell ya.We have worked our ass's off on this house.We spent our house payment money on paint and stuff for the house. We painted all the walls except for my bedroom.But there is still furniture and shit everywhere.It is about to drive me insane.I am so ready to get this place organized,its crazy.But I have no help.Nigel goes to work comes home and doesn't want to do anything.And on his days off from work he doesn't want to help either.So thats cool.Nigel's happy though. His dad bought him a mini harley motorcycle. $800. So as of tommorow he will be driving that to work.Guess Vickie's taxi service is out of order.Which the mercedes that I am driving needs to be parked anyway cause it leaks oil and is about to blow up.So Nigel got his motorcycle he picked out offline,and now he will be gone w/the wind...So thats the only good news.My dog dies,and Nigel gets a new motorcycle.??Ironic??Wierd?Whats up with that?...Life Sucks Sometimes! You know?I'm happy for him,just wish my dog was still alive:("

Anyway,as soon as i finish my testing they will send all my results to my insurance and if i'm approved,my surgery date will be sometime near October? I can't wait,i am sooooooooo excited you have no idea! My sister,Tammy had it done and she was wearing a size 24 in jeans and now wears a size8!!! So yeah!!! :) Anyway,kevin,and nick have grown.Kevin now weighs 50lbs so they are already on him for his weight,for a 4yr old. Nick is the perfect weight and height for 3yrs old.Justin is still really heavy,he now weighs 170lbs. Trying to get him to exersize more,and eat less. Fun times...So guess we all are doing great.We are buying our first house! Its $60,000.00. But the lady is really cool and is letting us pay payments,so thats cool. The house is not new,but is 1250 square foot,and has a huge fenced in back yard!!! Which i love for the kids.Its on a acre and a half of land,which is included in the price! So thats exciting! I am going back to work,or back to school,after my surgery.So we can bring in more money.Trust me we will need it! Well that about sums it up.So take care,God bless,and i'll come back and visit this journal sometime,k? ..:)"

I was hoping that we could live here until jan.then put a down payment on a doublewide. And besides that,our 96 pontiac grand am blew up today,yep the damn motor is no more.

Oh,and did i mention that we wrote 200.00 worth of checks and we are negative in the bank.And our lights are about to be cut off,and our phone..I tell ya,it just keeps getting better. Nigel is passed out,in bed,from drinking his worrys away. Yeah right like that helps...My ex-boyfriend/kevin's blood father/sperm donor,is trying to start shit again w/ nigel. Which is not what we need. Nigel has 2 failure to appear/warrents for his arrest,so the last thing he needs is to get in trouble and get arrested. He owes his lawyer 200.00 before his lawyer will take care of his warrents. Anyway,yeah my ex came into the same store that me and nigel was in and talked mad shit to nigel,and nigel held his cool,but wanted to kill him. That was baddddd. Anyway,I'm doing ok,just got over a bad cold. Which nick,and kevin had also.They are almost over it too. So yeah things are great!!!!

Sad story/very screwed up person!Anyway ,Nigel and I decided we were going to ask her mom if she could spend the weekends w/ us from now on,and possibly this summer. And so far she has let her stay this weekend.Its been very interesting thats for sure.. ! She will be leaving tommorow. And who knows if her bitch mother will let her come back. We haven't heard from Tommy? Who Knows where he is.Oh well.As far as where we are moving? Who knows ?not me?And w/ what money?Scary thought!Well Happy Mothers Day to all the mothers! later"

"event","Well today was pretty decent/good. Nigel woke me up around 7:00am. We had a yard sale.We made about 80 bucks or so.Which was enough to pay my mom,and Beca back,and have about 25 dollars left.But thats better than what I did have. Right?After the yard sale,we went to help Nigel's dad vinyl his barn.So Nigel is exhausted. Anyway,a man ended up buying our buick for $800.00 so we got $300.00 of it,and mamma and daddy G got the other $500. But hey, I can live with that.So we went to Walmart.Then we went out to eat at Applebee's to eat.Which was good..yum. Then we tried to go by to see Tommy at his place/hotel room.But the lights were off,and so he didn't answer the door.So guess he was not there.? Its Saturday nite,he may have went out w/friends.So anyway,we came back home.Today was good overall except,i didn't get but 3 hours of sleep last nite,but thats normal,right? Poor Nigel never went to sleep at all last night,so he is really really tired.Hes playing cards with Justin right now.Kevin and Nick are being bad as usual tearing up the house,when i just cleaned it. But whats new? Its about 3:45am right now. We should probably get some sleep. I wanted to attept to go to church.We need to go,we've been very blessed lately!!Thank You GOD for all that you've done for us!!!Ok,thats all for now.Tootles!  :)"

"event","Well,lets see..hum..whats new? Well ok we were moving to Farmville. But now we are not? I don't know where we are moving yet. I'll keep you posted.in case you care..?..Tommy is gone. He moved out into a hotel,and is on his own. Hes been having a ball hanging with friends,partying,going to the beach,that kinda stuff you get to do when you are a single guy.Sounds fun? I guess.He seems to be happy with what is going on in his life. Except he lost his job.Which I know that sucks for him.You know its almost like he was never here? He doesn't really have much to do with us anymore? Does he still care? He only calls us when he wants to pick something up here that he left,or to see if someone has called for him. Nice of him.Right? Guess he doesn't need his brother,or sis in law anymore. He's gone with the wind..yeah,ok anyway,Nigel was debating on joining the army again. Kinda scary thought! But for now,hes not talking about it every sec. like he was. He said hes going to get a job around here,So that means hes not going to make me move out of state!!! Thank God! so..Beca's dog,nilla,had puppies/Sharpie's.Haven't seen them yet but i bet they're cute! JJ is coming for the weekend,so shes really happy. Roberts bday is this weekend so we are having somethin for him.Fun. Nigel has been really sweet to me lately,which is great.We thought i was pregnant again,but i'm not.Which is cool,whatever.I love him bunches!:)well thats just about it..ttfn"

Lots of dirt dust,and beer bottles. Not good for my alllergies. So i guess we'll go back tom. for some more fun cleaning. I hate moving! Did you know that? Yes i do. It's too much shit to move and pack! Oh well not much of a choice. Now i get to have fun cleaning here. Nigel is asleep. Tommy is going to sleep. But the kids are wide awake. And this house looks like a hell hole. So there u go more cleaning and no help. I don't understand tommy. He used to help, but not anymore. He either doesn't give a shit to help, or he is just a lazy ass. Anyway i had to clean by myself, before he came so here i go again. Fun Fun. Oh well gotta go for now, too much cleaning to do."

The bad part is Nigel had to give the asshole a computer to get her back. So that was a loss. Anyway alot has happened since i've written last. Tommy is still here but its cool. He's started helping out w/ the bills now. He works at krogers. Nigel is still in the computer biz,.He has also taken up a dog adoption biz. So we have lots of dogs here. Funn..So we may be moving in a few weeks. I'm not too excited about it yet<? Nigels dad has a farm house in Farmville, we may be moving there? Atleast we won't have to pay rent. I haven't told any of my family yet. JJ has gone to Alabama and left Bec w/the kids cause hes got a job there? So they may be moving there??? Who knows... We'll just see how everything works out.? Tonight, we ,Nigel,Tommy and I are drinking . Me,pina'coladas, guess thats how u spell it. Tommys drinking Everclear,and coconut rum. Nig is drinking evan williams.So thats fun i guess?

"event","Ok where do I begin. Oh ok,guess i'll start off with my dog being stolen. This is a very srewed up situation,first of all I should have known better than to let someone take my puppy from my house! But being the stupied/nice person that i am,i was ignorant and let her be taken right in front of me. Nigel says its just a dog. But thats not the point. I should have known better. I feel as if its all my fault! Anyway,hopefully we will get her back,i feel so bad for her,and yes i do miss her.:( Nigel is getting tired really quick of people screwing him over too. My boys,Kevin,Nick,and Justin,are doing great. Thank God! Although Justin I feel so sad for him. I went to child support court,with his sperm doner/bio. father and its seems as if he doesn't give a shit about Justin. How sad. But you know its his loss. Me and Nigel love Justin more than Jason ever could. So whatever. Life goes on.Thank God I have Nigel to love me,and family to love me."

"event","So hello. What's new? Nothing really here. Well thank God we do not have to move yet. Went and paid our landlord rent and he said he is not selling this land. if we ever move out he probably will,but I am not worried about that as for now. Well Nigel is in one of his grumpy moods today. Thats always fun. Not really.Tommy and Nigel have been playing the xbox for about two hours now.They must really love that xmen game we rented. I watched ""the village"" last night  which i thought sucked. I thought it was going to be scary, but nope.Anyways, we also have the movie ""envy"" which maybe i'll get to watch tonight,hope it doesn't suck.? Well Jackie finally broke it off w/Tommy officially. which did not really surprise me. But hes doing rather well. He was hurt,but mostly pissed when she did it, but hes doing great now.And guess thats about it."

"event","Well,its been alittle while since i wrote...Lets see what has been going on in my crazy life? Well, Tommy left last week for a couple of days,he slept in dumpsters and stole food. Then he came back,and is here now. At that time,Nigel had convinced himself that tommy and i were/had slept together? Which by the way has NEVER happened! Anyway, so he went on a rage broke our glass door, threw stuff, got violent w/me which was scary! That was when tommy left. Then like i said now Tommy is back. Go figure? So far, nigel and tommy are getting along? As for new info. in my life, we may have to move soon!? Which really sucks! I hate moving! Anyway,where will we go? Only God knows. I guess Friday i will take the rent money up there to our landlords house and see what is going on! He told nigel  we had 10 days to get out, so that leaves us with like 7 days left, i think? FUN! not really..Nigel and i have already started looking somewhere else just in case, so far nothing...:(  I am awake right now, bc justin missed the school bus again, well it was kinda my fault i didn't wake up, w/ the alarm.opps. So i took him to school,came back and is now doing this....Well thats all for now"

"event","OK,well valentines day started off sucky, but later it got better. The day b4 v-day Nigel was a sweetie and bought me a beautiful opal ring!It was so sweet the way he did it, he surprised me, it was great! So anyway we didn't finally get out until really late so we went to the movies, then we went to Deny's. I was just glad we finally had a great time Alone! Right now its like 5:00 am, and nigel and tommy are organizing his computer stuff, fun. I think things here are going to get better, especially between nigel and tommy, thank God! They had a talk tonight and hopefully cleared things up. Who knows? Anyway, i hope so b/c i think its sad the way they were acting to each other. I love nigel w/ all my heart, and i care about tommys well- being, and it really hurt me inside to see them hurting. I feel that they should cherish their time together, b/c they missed so many years. i feel responsible for part of the separation of their friendship. There has been alot of jealously in our house. I know alot of it is my fault, but trust me none of it was intentional, i swear. But thats another story... Hopefully all will work out for all of our good! Well i gotta go"

Anyway Tommy is still here and thats ok he hopefully is getting a job soon.He is now back engaged to jackie,so whatever. Sorry i know he deserves better, but apparently he doesn't think so? Nigel and i are/were doing great, but hes pissed at me at the moment b/c Cherie was talking shit about him,and he wanted me to talk shit back, but i couldn't , first of all she wouldn't listen, then i told her it was her opinion,to basically shut up! So, happy times!? Right?Tommorow will hopefully be better,although i have lots of things to do and no car to go anywhere! I have an important appointment to be at @ 8:45,and nigel has court @9:00,so thats not good. Then we are supposed to look for a car to buy..I* guess we'll be walking!? Well gotta go"

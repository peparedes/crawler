"event","When did this become such a negative thing??  i bet in ancient rome this was a revered practice (plus it was real dusty so they probably picked like crazy).  plus, what am i supposed to do?? just let it gather up there till i have to breathe out of my nose??  its not even really that dirty.  its just looked down upon in our society.  man i wish i could pick my nose in public sometimes.  theres really not much better than gettin that big chunk and taking that deep, uninterrupted, unblocked breath.  it makes me feel alive.  oh and by the way....just cause youre in your car doesnt mean that no one can see you pick it.....just remember that....your windows ARE see-through."

"event","ok....something that should just not be allowed, ever....under any circumstances.  if you have to go to the bathroom thats fine, its natural after all.  however, there are times when you should ignore the call of nature, cross your legs, squeeze, think about baseball (wait thats something else), anything to avoid going.  and im not talking about just going #1.  im talking the big kahuna.  never ever ever ever under any circumstances should you take a dump in the following locations, ever.  a plane bathroom, a train bathroom, or a bus.  these are just rules that should be made into laws that should never be violated.  i cannot stress this enough.  do WHATEVER it takes!!  i should not have to be subjected to your last nights pizza or burrito.  i paid good money to ride the plane/bus/train and there is no reason you cant hold it for a few hours.  please plan ahead.  and if it takes you by surprise please just jump out of the nearest window.  thank you."

"event","Ok, so lets say someone comes up to you and says Hey, how you doin?  Why cant i just say Im great, thanks.?  Why do i have to pretend that im interested in how theyre doing?  Why do i have to ask just to be polite?  What if i REALLY dont care?  Is it rude not to ask?  Is it something i have to do sort of like saying please and thank you EVERY TIME someone hands me something at the dinner table?  Have you ever been to a thanksgiving dinner where the only thing thats said for about 15 minutes is please and thank you?  I dont know....it seems a bit excessive to me.  Just for the sake of being polite.  Who determines whos polite and who isnt anyway?  is there some Polite Panel somewhere making the decisions for the rest of humanity or what?  I dont know."

but i assure that i will
give it good effort

Hi.

It's been nearly a year since I last posted on livejournal (yes, facebook readers, this is a livejournal post).

Maybe it's time for an update?

I think, maybe, that more has happened than I will be capable of documenting here, but I will try.

I finished my internship with Annie Thompson. 
Then she hired me on to be her web designer, and I finished that project earlier this year.

I showed at the One of A Kind show in the Spring.

Entirely seperate from my thesis, I also produced a capsule clothing line with fellow designer Alex DeFrancesco - Resurrection.  It was a collection of undead-clothes which were featured in Toronto Alternative Fashion Week.  Many fashion blogs listed our collection as a favourite part of the night.  See a video <a href=""http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=1HcaHH-3zVs"">here</a>.

I participated in 4 group exhibitions this year:The MAAD Shadowbox Fundraising Exhibition (both pieces I contributed sold!)
The OCADSU 2008 Retrospective
The OCAD Annual Student Exhibition
Debut @ Edward Day Gallery

I was part of the development & production team that published this year's Material Art & Design Thesis Catalogue - in which my work is also published.

I actually finished my thesis... and proudly.  I was/am VERY happy with what I produced this past year.
So were my panel - I got 90%.

Drew and I have now been together for 9 years.  Wow.

I've been commissioned to design & produce 3 wedding dresses and 3 bridesmaid dresses.

I graduated on the Dean's Honour List.  With 2 scholarships and a bursary.

Two days after graduating I was hired by the Textile Museum of Canada for a full-time summer contract - a job that over 275 other students applied for.

I joined a textile art collective - lemon collective ( www.lemoncollective.com ).  We had a table at the Big on Bloor Festival, and have been accepted (and given the largest room) at the pieceWork sale at Gladstone Hotel in November.

I was accepted into the Toronto Outdoor Art Exhibition - managed to truck my work to and fro for 3 days and sit in a smoking hot tent.  I sold a small segment of work, enough to cover my costs, and won an Honourable Mention for best student in show (which came attached to a gallery membership and a cash prize!).

I'm having a blast, but I'm also exhausted - as all these things have had deadlines, and have overlapped a great deal.

Right now, I'm working 9am-5pm every weekday at the Textile Museum, and running straight to OCAD every night to work on Ceramics for my Summer Mold-making class (yes, I'm in a class even though I graduated.  I'm crazy).  On Saturdays I work at G&S Dyes from 10am-3pm and rush straight home to work on the first wedding dress commission, as it needs to be done, like, YESTERDAY.  Sundays I'll also be at the Textile Museum, but 11-5... to make up for days I missed earlier in the contract.

Due to having to take public transit, about 3.5-5 hours is added to my schedule daily.  I leave my house by 7am every morning, and get home ever weekday at midnight, every Saturday at 5 (to sew) and Sundays at 8.  I barely have time to sleep let alone laundry/cooking/cleaning/pet care-taking/socializing/ANYTHING.   It all seems so great in theory but is incredibly hard in practice.  I can't really complain though - I took it all on myself.

August 5th my night class ends, that will make things easier.  If I manage to complete the wedding dress in a week or two (WHICH I BETTER!!!), that will ease things too.  And on labour day, my hours at the museum get cut from 5-days a week to 3-days a week.  And in October the contract is done.  So quieter, easier times are coming, but I've been going full-tilt since January without so much as a wink of break time...  lets see just how many winds I've got in the wings.

...i have so much to give.  i want to get it out of my chest now... it hurts when it's all crammed in there.

keep up with questions
that are hard due to their
obscurity tick"

so intense trying

so I'm now extra-bloggy.

at my new internship at the Annie Thompson Studio, I've been journalling my progress and experience at http://annieslittleintern.blogspot.com .

I started it at Blogger instead of livejornal because I heard that it was much easier to post photos... as I have yet to post photos, I'm not sure if that's truly the case.

I'm considering switching it to a livejournal because I can edit the dates and postday-post.  And because of the mood & music things i like so much.

so, i've clearly been busy as hell.  facebook's become the new thing, so my lj has suffered... but whatever.

roomate Mikey's moved to BC (how jealous am i? very...)
and so Drew & I have his room to take on as a studio.

point:  i have too much shit to fit in that room.

it's currently a sprawling disaster throughout the house.
garbage bags under the basement stairs.
a suitcase under the couch
a tower of boxes and loose bags in the living room.
a load of paper next to my bed, binders and framed work under it...

this is ridiculous.

i have art materials i will never use.
fabrics i was given that are -not- part of my colour scheme.
Excess appliances and machines (sewing machine, serger, microwave, mini-fridge).
More art and clothes that I've made than you can imagine.

I need to get rid of it, but we missed the community yardsale.

I don't have a car, and most people are loath to help with moving junk to goodwill or what have you.

and I just can't throw so much good value into a landfill.

I'll get to writing a list, see if the facebook marketplace is up to the task :)"

"event","for anyone who wanted to have more info on the pet food recall,<br> <lj-cut text=""look behind the cut"">

I wanted to give you another update about the recent pet food recall. As you know, last week there was a dog and cat food recall of 60 million containers packaged under 95 brands of food. The preliminary reports indicated that the affected foods caused over 16 deaths and may have caused illness in hundreds of others. Reports are continuously being updated and there is still a lot that we don't know.

What we do know is that the Agriculture Commissioner of New York State Patrick Hooker released information that Aminopterin has been found in some of the tested cat foods.  Aminopterin is a form of rat poison. It is not approved for use in the U.S.  It is not possible to test pets for this chemical at this time. No one seems to know as to how much or if any other compounds were found. There are many unanswered questions.

They do know that the compound involved is causing kidney failure. The most common signs of kidney failure are: vomiting, not eating, drinking more, urinating more and/or lethargy. If your pet is eating or was eating one of the recalled foods and is experiencing any symptoms, please call your veterinarian immediately. We recommend testing and treating all affected pets! If caught early, kidney failure can be treated successfully in some pets.

For more information read about ""Renal Failure in Dogs"" and ""Renal Failure in Cats"":
http://clicks.aweber.com/z/ct/?2647Nqcdmnvmi0LU5eAUbQ
http://clicks.aweber.com/z/ct/?oLKg3mSNFsISV1s_wLlKqQ

The food recall covers several different foods - primarily those with gravy components - with the dates of December 3rd - March 6th. The recall does not affect all varieties of the different food.
For information or an updated list, call 1-866-895-2708 or go to:
http://clicks.aweber.com/z/ct/?AU505nZV8FKk6icnn2lzyA.

If you suspect your pet has been affected by the food - please read these steps to help your veterinarian with your pet's diagnosis:
Go to Advice to Pet Food Owner After National Recall:
http://clicks.aweber.com/z/ct/?YvIsKBejE5YFHVfqqlmIeQ

Here is also an update for veterinarians. Go to ""Pet Food Recall - Updated Information for Veterinarians"":
http://clicks.aweber.com/z/ct/?RGOoAYY4Qow2bWBozIalNQ

This article gives recommendations and resources for veterinarians. If your pet has been affected, please print both articles and take them with you when you see your vet.

I sincerely hope that none of your pets are affected.</lj-cut>

"event","All of the brands of cat & dog food produced by menu foods in the last couple batches is contaminated with something which has killed many household pets throughout North America over the last month.  Reports claim between 10 and 250 deaths in the last 5 days (I cannot corroborate any numbers) related to acute renal kidney failure.  I've attached the list of possibly dangerous foods for both cats and dogs. 
If your pets food is on the list, check out http://www.menufoods.com/recall to see if yours is one of the dangerous batch, and check for symptoms of kidney failure (symptom list attached). 
 
Please forward this to, or at least warn/call/talk to your friends with cats & dogs.  No one should have to lose a pet, but especially not because of feeding them something that's supposed to be semi-nutritious.

Oh dear.  I'm very interested in applying but I'm concerned about the fine print in the application contract (the 5 pages of fine print involving a lot of the producer's ownership of my work and likeness...)
Well, I'll prepare stuff with the assumption I'll be applying before I pass it by a lawyer.

I also managed to get a great deal of work done.  My ASCII wallhanging self-portrait, the felt corset, the headnand-level, and my instruction manuals all got done for monday.  Therefore I did not sleep.  The sketchbooks on the other hand, not so much (I'll hand those in late).  Today I wrote out my proposal for another project... so all there REALLY is to do this week is to make 14-21 miniature garments, fill up my sketchbooks and write and ""abstract"" (exxentially a proposal + bibliography) for my fashion class' paper.

I'm glad I use the LJ haiku maker twice per post.  The more I write into this feed, the more interesting and poetic the non-sentient haiku maker gets.  It's neat.

I am feeling much better than my previous post would have you believe.
I suppose I always write with a bit of a depressed air... and when I'm ecstatically happy, I generally am doing something of far greater importance than documenting myself online...

I need some photos of myself.  This is getting ridiculous.  I have a grand total of two photos of myself that I like (one of which is over 7 years old...), and only another 5 or so that I tolerate.  I need something to put on my dumb facebook account, maybe update my myspace considering my halloween photo's still there.

I just saw the 2007 Spring Summer Haute Couture Alexander McQueen Collection (shown in Paris)...  I worship McQueen.  I really, really do.  Dior was good too - Galliano was in charge, and Gaultier's always pretty neat-o.  I wish I had gone to Ryerson for fashion, like I -wanted- to.  I was told that my university would be supported by the fam if I went for something more generic, like general art, so that I could get a job afterwards.  Turns out, I would've been far more likely to get an immediate job outta Ryerson, and I wasn't supported through OCAD in the least.... boo.

So, it's been nearly 3 months.  Jeez.

I can't believe that the last time I posted, Grandy was still with us. I've encountered death before, but never so close to my heart. I was pretty shattered.  Still pulling pieces together, still occasionally falling back apart...I had a really painful time trying to clean out her apartment with my aunt.  so hard to throw away her things... and i took too much for myself...

But I had a marvelous time out in BC for Christmas... mom's house and business are doing well, and my sisters both seem to have good paths ahead of them...

I got my marks back from first semester... 95% in Psychology! Too bad all my friends think psych is a load of horse shit...  

I've rediscovered a number of old friends from late elementary and early high school...  it's strange.  some i felt a need to reconnect with.  others i wish i could simply forget.

I have spectacular classes this semester, but I'm already falling behind... i have no motivation.

i've been talking about running a new fashion show for over a year now... but circumstances keep getting in the way and I feel like an ass for mentioning it to anyone in the first place.

i've been talking about visiting New York for about a year too, and again, circumstance.  Every time I send my goddamn passport package to the govn't, they send it back saying there's something wrong with it.  Now there's no way I'll get it in time for reading week.  

Not that anyone would come with me anyway - the folks who keep promising to go with me never have money when the event comes around... I don't know if I could handle going to NY alone amongst a group of OCAD'ers that I don't know...

I really don't fit here.

If you're interested in seeng a low res video of my fashion set at Toronto Alternative Fashion Week, check out my myspace: http://myspace.com/magdelina

""Films"" is where the video is.  I also posted one of <a href=""http://www.zaiden.com"">Zaiden's</a> fabulous photos in the photo section.

I'ts been a rough couple weeks.  My maternal grandmother had a stroke a month ago.  She was recovering well, had been moved into a long-term care branch to recover, and we had planned to fly her out to BC to live with my mother.  I was going to escort her there, I was looking forward to seeing those green hills against the ocean again...  but she had a series of continual strokes from Friday through Sunday.  She can no longer use the left side of her body.  She can no longer swallow and has become completely helpless.  She's in the process of dying, since she can no longer get sustenance beyond her IV.  My mother flew in on Sunday,  my sister Aislinn flew in yesterday and my youngest sister will be arriving at 6am tomorrow morning.  To say goodbye... things had been looking so good before...  I know that my grandmother has wanted to move on for years now, it's still very hard.  My work, both employment and educational, is suffering.  I'm having difficulty focusing while this happens.  I do think that my grandmother and I had a good goodbye already, but I'm heading to the hospital tomorrow anyway.

To try and get my mind off this mess, I went out for Halloween in the costume I spent all week (prior to Grandy's trouble) working on.  <lj-cut text=""To see, peek behind the cut."">

<lj-cut text=""let's get to the cut, shall we?"">

so the renovations are complete!  the house looks at least 70% better in my opinion.
well, the main floor, anyway.  I've been online shopping to get slipcovers for all our furniture, so it can match a little.  maybe I'll even get a window treatment of some kind.

wow, i really am turning into a housewife... good thing i'm back to school & work next week.

seems like everyone around me is either gettin' married or having babies. 
Steph & James, married last year.  
Jill & Dan, married last year.
Kate and her boy, married last year.
Myles and his boy, married last year.
Derek and Susan, married this year.
Grace and Alex, married this year.
Steph & James, having a baby.
Jill & Dan, having a baby.
Amanda & Frank, having a baby.
Chris & Jana, having a baby.
Katherine & Brett, to be married.
Chris & Jana, to be married.

being in a very long term relationship but not getting hitched yet has left me feeling a little 'left behind'... but, I also WANT ample time to prepare for a spectacular wedding... and I have NO plans of baby-making.  

I actually bought myself a fat cubic zirconia while i was out in BC, kept it on my left ring finger... it was an attempt to send out the 'taken' signal without having to say anything.  didn't work.  i honestly had NEVER been ""hit on"" in my life (by someone within a 15 year range, I'm kinda used to gross middle-aged to elderly men with missing teeth and forehead growths hitting on me) until this recent trip to bc, where twenty-somethings everywhere seemed to stumble in my prescence. One guy even called me ""awe-inspiring"" - yeah, he did seem a bit nutty, but he looked kinda normal... It was both bizarre and uplifting. 

I spent the last couple days TRYING to get a weekend trip to New York worked out for this last weekend before classes... but no go.  I'll have to see the big apple some other time.  If Drew weren't so opposed to going, it'd be easier.  I don't wanna go on my own (not terribly confident of my self-defense skills...), and companion fares are way cheaper anyway... so I must find myself a travelling companion first.

BC was beautiful.  It was really hard to come back.  If it weren't for Drew, I probably wouldn't have.  I love that island.  I love the forest, the temperate climate, the clean, sea air, the slower pace of life, the fresher, organic foods... I miss my family, mostly my mother (we're really the same person in two different skins, i think...), I already miss working in her bookstore, drinking homemade chardonnay, watching the sunset from her garden swing, overlooking the farm across the dirt road... 

I climbed up Mount Park this time.  Twice.  in one day.  I think that's how I managed to maintain my weight while eating my mother's excellent, but fatty cooking.  MMMmmmm, eggs, cream and butter... versus my regular coffee whitener, liquid yolk-free eggs, skim milk and light becel....  At least they're as into crystal light and special k bars as I am!

I saw Tool out in BC... spectacular, yes, but I didn't enjoy it as mucha s I should.  I found myself disappointed in my ability to retain Tool lyrics... at a truly powerful show, I generally need to be able to sing along, and know exactly what's being sung about to grasp the emotion of the moment... I suppose that's because I'm not a musician, and simply don't ""speak"" music... That's not to say that I don't enjoy non-English or instrumental music.  Just I can only have a truly connective moment with the band when there's a common language for me to follow.  Anyway, it was still a great show. Craziest light show I've ever seen. Wish you all coulda been there. </lj-cut>

Oh, and I've been accepted into Toronto Alternative Fashion Week for my second year running!

so everyone, keep <b>Thursday, October 19th 2006</b> free for my fashion show!

my house has been under renovations for the last 2 weeks.  kindof.
Steve, our contractor, seems to show up for 1 out of every 4 days.
makes great progress while he's around, though.
our washroom doesn't make me embarrassed anymore!
The kitchen is having some serious work right now.
I just heard that the bill is at aboput $7000, and they haven't even started the flooring yet... What ""needs to be done"" is a list that just keepd getting longer and more expensive.  I tried to tell Lynda that it was too much... I know they want us to live comfortably & happily but I feel like such a leech. They're even giving us a bedroom set and a couch from Lynda's mother's apartment (she has recently relocated to a furnished seniors residence).

When it's all done, I want to have a couple nice dinners with guests. Particularly Fred & Lynda. But I'll be in BC by the time it's finished, and who wants to bet that the guys will manage to make the main floor laughably disasterous before I return?

yes, even though I haven't a penny to my name I'm travelling again.
My mother and sisters teamed up on paying for my flight.
I wouldn't have taken it if I didn't know how badly my mom needs a hand.

I'm really upset that I'll be missing Pancino and HailHail play...
But I'm sure there will be many more shows later on.

I hope I can get into the Tool concert in Vancouver.  
I happen to be flying in on the night of the concert.

I haven't been sitting around, doing nothing, this summer.
Check out : http://www.bedowynn.com  - Drew's new website by me.
Also, I've been working very hard at getting healthy & into shape.
I haven't felt so good since... I can't remember feeling this good!
All my clothes are loose, but not so much that I need a new wardrobe
(getting rid of clothes is somethin I can rarely manage).
I feel much better about myself, and I think I'm a bit more confident, too.

Also, everyone needs a  Grace Donati.
Grace is the world's best hairstylist.
She cut my hair in June, and it looked better than any cut I've ever had.
I haven't gotten my hair cut  since, and even though it's gone through summer damage, my complete lack of proper hair care, and has grown nearly an inch and a half, it -still- looks amazing.  I get complimented all the time.  I will never let anyone other than Grace cut my hair again.

Pancino's new EP is almost fully recorded.
Drew's up to record next, then vocals... then onto the polishing & production.

I applied for Toronto Alternative Fashion Week again. Cross your fingers for me.

I was hired 2 weeks ago by a con man who owned a call center.  Thought I was selling vacation packages - turns out I was scamming people via telefraud.  Only took me 2 shifts to figure it out.  Obviously, quit and called phonescammers (detatchment of rcmp).

last night, i had a craving for fruit salad.
i went to the kitchen, cut up a banana with an excessively large knife.
mixed frozen yogurt with my ""fruit spread"" (thick, pureed berries).
suddenly felt very light headed, nauseous and cramped.
sat down at the kitchen table, behind which are 3 roomates bikes.
feel dizzier.  
the pain in my abdomen becomes amplified to a point that I cannot think.
i lean onto my folded arms, my chin against te tabl, breathing deeply.
i open my eyes, to find my position has changed.
i am now leaning back, haphazardly, across the pile of bikes, barely on my seat.
the internal pain has migrated to my right arm, and it screams.
the left side of my face is numb, my brain aches, i'm too dizzy to think.
i'm terrified. i think i'm having or had, a stroke.
i think it's a blood clot in my brain.
i think i'm going to die.
i stumble into the living room, barely able to keep my feet under me.

after some water, drew finishes the fruit salad for me, and we eat it...
the sugar restores my energy, lying still appears to return my mental capacities...
i think my face was numb from smashing it off the bikes - it's bruising a bit...
i don't know how i came to change position unconciously...

it was so terrifying.

you know those CSI episodes, when a person goes through a crazy trauma moment,

i've been terrified of that all day now.

i decided to post the remainer of my time at PDA before my memory runs dry.
<lj-cut text=""...the night of thursday, july 7th..."">

so, after the unfortunate and upsetting ""rehearsal"", Drew and i started walking towards the hostel (OceanIsland) we'd be staying at for the night, hoping to come upon a place to have dinner on the way.  We were almost there when I realized that we had enough time to see a movie, and there were 2 theatres a very short distance from the hostel.  We'd both seen ""Revenge of the Sith"" prior (I, on a bootleg DVD of questionable quality, he had seen it twice in theatres already), but we wanted to see it together.  We'd planned on seeing it Saturday afternoon, but it seemed to fit at that moment anyway.  We bought our tickets and found a bar across the street that had $3 beer and $3.25 martinis - how perfect?  And spent the 40 spare minutes we had munching on appetizers and drinking in ""Syn"" - which, although it had horrendous music, was probably the most aesthetically pleasing bar I'd ever seen, as well as having a menu of exquisite martinis and cocktails.

the movie was, of course, great - we both already knew that.  (i know the new trilogy isn't comparable to the old, and that episode 1 was the worst movie ever, so don't harrass me.)  We walked back to OceanIsland and had a fairly decent night's sleep, considering my constant panic at the time.

</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""...friday, july 8th..."">

friday morning we cleared our belongings out of the hostel room and went for breakfast at a fairly cheap greasy spoon type restaurant.  We went straight to the school so I could do some last-minute fixing on some outfits, taking them in a couple inches so that they could be worn at the show.  It didn't take terribly long to do what was still possible - about 2 hours.  I managed to make one more outfit wearable and dramatically improved the look of another.

my family & two of mom's friends came in from Mayne again that morning, and picked Kat Rogers (friend & photographer) up from the airport on the way.  They came to meet me at the school (and picked up Drew) so I could tell them about the hotel bookings.  Apparently, the OceanPointe Resort couldn't get us cheap rooms, so we ended up being put a 20 minute drive away at a smaller hotel. And my mother's friend Martha had her dog!  We'd been told that a dog was ok at the OceanPointe, but had no idea about this one!  It was crazy stressful, but it luckily worked out ok.  Also, I found my cds of music and backdrop photographs in the car, and i thought i had lost them.

Melissa and Jill showed up to pick up all the clothing, and Megan to do my nails.  Melissa and Jill finished packing up and left, and then Megan and I realized that they missed Leilani's focal dress and my box of shoes.  We decided to take a cab, but while waiting for it, Megan's mom drove by, and we luckily got a free ride.

There was virtually no one there yet when we arrived, so Megan started on my nails while things weren't terribly busy.  The staging and curtaining was set up while i was there, the models and some of the designers left to have their hair & makeup done, and essentailly there was a couple hours of just myself and Carly being there to arrange the backstage.

I had planned on doing a fashion shoot before or after the show, but it was becoming less and less possible as the minutes ticked by.  The hair was taking WAY too long.  As the models started streaming back they looked spectacular, but leilani and megan, who were going to be doing my hair, got back only minutes before the show.  I started working on it myself, and it wasn't doing well.  Luckily, the hairstylists showed up and i got some help.  My hair was HUGE.

There are actually a LOT of details I'm missing here, aren't you glad?  I stressed out at every fleck of dust that day.  Good thing i don't remember them all.

Dad showed up with Aislinn & Meara (they visited with him for the day), and then so did Mom, Martha, Janet, Kat and Drew.  I had reserved the best seat I could for Kat, and Dad, Aislinn Meara and Drew sat near her, at the end of the catwalk, first row.  Mom, Martha and Janet sat first row to the right of the first stretch of catwalk.  We had a spectacular catwalk, it had 3 branches coming off of it, and it was super hot watching the choreography (3 models on stage at once).

Backstage was insane, not enough room or time for anything!  Girls stripping and being stripped while others are trying to find their next outfit while others are crawling over the shoes to find the next pair while others were trying to squeeze into semi-laced corsets on their own!  It was absolutely bizarre.  I loved it, kindof.

I couldn't see what was going on onstage, i was trying to make sure everyone would be prepared for my set.  Finally it came, the music went seamlessly into the production, as well as the backdrop photos. (although the projector guys couldn't speed them up - they were supposed to flip MUCH faster).  Then I had to walk on stage, and i was shaking like a leaf!  I did it fairly confidently, but after seeing the photos now, i really wish i hadn't walked the whole catwalk, i feel i looked really quite gross.

After returning backstage, I did my best to help everyone else with their sets, and I occaisionally popped out to watch parts. It was a full house - i think it was mostly family members of the designers, but it was still pretty amazing.
</lj-cut>

Again, I have a lot to do right now, so I should cut this off around here.

I was reminded of a lot of this by the fashion show i'm preparing for now.  Apparently, they had to cut out one of my outfits from this show because there's a stain on the back of it (i hope it's not ruined... i don't think there was a stain when i brought it there), I have to bring a sewing machine to fix a hem and I need to iron everything (they don't even have a garment steamer!!)  the day of the show.  ARG.  And tomorrow I have to bring in an art piece to the gallery to replace the rejected one (""passion"", the heart quilt stretched over canvas, 25"" X 25"", rejected because it was too big).  

And it's really strange not having Drew around (he's touring eastern Canada with his second band, Reckon with One).. I get all strange when I'm alone.  Everyone else works, then comes home to eat, smoke weed and watch tv... I'm getting no real social interaction, and it's making me pretty weird.

And I still have a lot of shit to do for school.

"event","yay! my computers back (and running better than ever!) and i finished Kat Roger's website! <a href=""http://www.kateyeimaging.com"">Kat Eye Imaging</a> ~ check it out!

My showing at Toronto Alternative Fashion week is as follows:
Textile Art at [FAT] show opening: Wed Sept 28th, 7pm Kabat-Wroebel gallery (99 Sudbury St, Toronto)
magdelina designs catwalk show: Fri Sept 30th, 9:30pm Touch Lounge (499 King St W, Toronto)
check out <a href=""http://www.alternativefashionweek.com"">the site</a> for more info.

help! for thinktank class i have to write a guide to surviving in an urban area (toronto, specifically) for a year during a permanent blackout.

feel like brainstorming?

i need to cover the aspects:
shelter/heat/protection
food/drinking water/washing water
mobility
clean environment/waste disposal
energy
communication
tools

different approaches would work during the short/long term.
(ie, looting would only be worthsile for so long)

what's available for use in the urban sprawl?
what happens when there's no running water?
when every household toilet backs up waste?

Catastrophe Induced Urban Tribalism!

for all of them realized
immediately

sorry about the ipod junk, people.
my computer's busted, i have NO money (at all, whatsoever), and nothing to do beyond scrub the grime that has built up over this past year in this house.  I really want to live without roomantes one day, as much as i love them, i am SO SICK of how disgusting this all is.  ...and they all got back into eating nuts in my absence... i'm terrified of cooking/eating in my own kitchen (what if there's traces of nuts on this dish rag? this teatowel? this poorly washed dish?)...

it is SOOOO hot, i don't know how to deal with it, and the barometric pressure has gone completely haywire... my head feels like it's gonna explode.  Also, i used the scale here for the first time since my return... i think the scale in BC was broken... and I'm about 15 lbs heavier than I had thought.  GREAT.  It's so hard to cook meals for both drew & i, he DESPERATELY needs to gain weight, and I desperately want to lose it.

now i can't even recall all the events that i did't manage to log in....  i just remember how hectic my last month there was. i had about 16 outfits i wanted in the fashion show - and even more that i didn't bother with.  Only 7 made it to stage, thanks to a lack of modification time and ridiculously thin models.  I was sewing all the way into the day of the show.

<lj-cut text=""Aislinn's birthday..."">Celebrated Aislinn's 19th birthday on June 21st - i got her a ticket to Billy Corgan (as well as one for me, in Vancover on the 19th)  and a couple little things.  We went out for dinner and she had a few long island ice teas...</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Wednesday, July 6..."">I had a good time with Drew out there, short as it was.  We picked him up from Swartz Bay (he got from the airport, to Tsawassen Bay, to Swartz on his own with all that luggage...) on wednesday (the 6th of July)...  We went to Mayne to have dinner, walked to the camp ground across the street to smoke a joint, and found a wad of $154 US... this was a bit difficult for us, morally.  What to do?  There was no one left camping on the lot at the time, and nothing else left behind as a clue to who might have owed it.  The camp site had been paid for - so it wasn't their payment.  We kept a majority of the money, hoping that it was a karmic gift for all we'd been through (and maybe for having found the $400 digital camera and hunted down it's owner to return it, and for finding the owner of an ipod i had foud as well)... and we deposited a portion of it into the ""Good Karma"" box, hanging on the campground fence.  As much as we needed the money, i now wish we had left it ALL in that box.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Thursday, July 7..."">The next day, we went to all of Mayne Island's stores in the morning, so i could show drew some of the really neat stuff available out there, and we took the late ferry in to Swartz - Thursday was the day of my graduation, and the day to drop off drew's artwork.  We stopped in Sidney to pick up frames for drew's art prints - just a bit too small so his prints had to be cropped.  My mother dropped us off at my school to work on some modifications.  There wasn't any time to.  I a bunch of my designs were missing from the racks, and i thought Melissa (my main teacher) had taken them home to modify them for models or something.  Carly (my secondary teacher) showed up to help, but really we only had enough time to change for the graduation and frame Drew's prints.  We stopped by the art gallery to drop off his work... and no one was there to answer the door!  We got it all back into Carly's Van, and booted it to St. Anne's Academy (location of the ceremony).  While getting out of her van, my dress zipper durst open.  No, it didn't just slide down, it broke.  I had no change of clothes, no over coat...it was HUMILIATING.  Thank the heavans that Carly happened to be a bridal specialist, and was used to fitting girls into dresses too small for them - she fixed my zipper, and warned me not to breathe, cough, sneeze, laugh, or slouch for the rest of the evening.

Drew & I seated ourselves, unable to find my family in the crowd.  The ceremony began - Interior design students graduated, blahblah... Mom, Meara and Aislinn showed up about halfway through the first class.  After another ridiculous hour or so, it was time for Fashio students to graduate.  When they called my name, I walked as graciously as I could up the podium, recieved my diploma, shoook hands with the 15 profs (most of which I'd ever met), recieved a rose from the school president, and returned to my seat - all without popping my dress zipper again. Whew!

We had a small (no-alcohal) reception, ate some sushi (they ordered veggie sushi too!), and prepared to leave.  We moved all our junk from Carly's van into mom's, and she dropped us off at the hostel we'd be staying at.  (all the hotels were $150 + per night, so we stayed at the OceanIsland hostel for $62)  I changed (again, whew!) and we called the Art gallery (studio 16 1/2) again - they were in!  So we walked all the way over to deliver his art.  Then we walked all the way to the Oceanpointe Resort for the rehearsal of the fashion show.  Turns out, the rehearsal included - nothing!  No stage, no clothes, no music.  It was just to see how well the models walked.  ARG!  Then Melissa handed out the sheets of who's designs would show when, who would be wearing what outfit.  I was listed as set number 4 (of 8), with only 6 outfits.  I was devastated.  I broke into tears immediately, and Drew and I left.  I just couldn't handle having to argue my case again.  I felt so insulted... you know when an essay is written, how the best argument goes last, the second-best goes first, and the worst is in the middle?  It DOES go the same at fashion shows, and my set was the middle set. And I had not been told that I would only have 6 outfits - up til that point it was 10. 

Drew took me to Swans, a nice restaurant we know fairly well, for a drink to calm my nerves.  I felt a bit better, but was still hurt. </lj-cut>

I've been typing for a while,  so i'll continue this later.  Friday will be the accout of the fashion show, so that'll be a lot of typing on it's own.

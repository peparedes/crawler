"event","....I finally think that I am finding out who I am day by day.  As my spirituality grows, my love for myself and who I am grows.  That is a beautiful African American woman.  Quentin says that I am one of those afro-centric woman.  I finally got material for my hair wraps and my hair is now natural, which I love better than my relaxed hair.  I chopped it all off, I have a job that I love, and I'm finally doing the things in school that I really want to do;  elementary education.  I thinking turning 22 was the turning point of a new Dana.  It was a wonderful birthday.  I loved it.  

I guess I am turning into an afro-centric woman.  My hair is natural, and I am starting to wrap it in clothes.  I have decided to date only black men so that I can have someone to relate to, and I have just grown to love and appreciate the african american male.  There are so many wonderful african american males I just dare not marry any other.  I love a lot of R& B, smooth grooves artist.  I am working with children at children's homes.  So, I am finding my own way.  Handling a lot of stress better.  I owe that to God.   I am no longer preoccupied with finding someone to date.  I love being by myself.  I almost made myself a promise to be single for the next five years so that I can make money and travel.  I love traveling.  

P.S.  Some one please come knock off Quentin...he is getting on my nerves!"

"event","I must say that I enjoyed the blackout.  I got a chance to experience New Yorkers roughing it.  It was so much fun besides the heat.  The cold showers were nice because it was so damn hot.  I don't ever remember being happy to get a cold shower.  But we were sititng on the side walks and the stoops by candlelight.  Practically everyone in the neighborhood was out and about in the streets.  Cars were about to get into wrecks because the traffic lights were out.  And if you've ever been to NY....you know that no traffic lights is pure hell.  Pedestrians were out on the corners directing traffic.  People stuck in subways.  We were about to go out into Manhatten that day, too.  So, if we went we would have been stuck in the subways and have to walk through miles and miles of tunnels with rats.

The funny part about it thought is that all the rich people who are in the ritzy hotels couldn't get into there rooms because the cards are electronically managed.  So, a lot of people in Manhatten had to sleep on newspaper on the streets.  I bet the homeless people got a good laugh off of that because now the rich have a taste of how it feels to be poor and homeless.  All I can imagine is a homeless person laying because someone with money telling them, ""I know where a great soup kitchen is around the corner.""  *sighs*  The struggles of life.  

The only part that I hate about the blackout is the backed up airlines because now I can't get home when I was supposed to be home Friday.  Whippe!!  NOT!  But it's extra vacation time with my bros.  :-)"

"event","my birthday was fun...didn't get drunk...don't need to cause I got high off life in NYC...woke up that morning...my bro made me breakfast...YUM....Rodney, Janet, and I explored upper Manhatten...we walked acrossed the Wiliamsburge bridge then went to China town and then walked across the Brooklyn Bridge.  Took some pics on Brooklyn Bridge because it is a pretty view on that bridge.  Then, Janet and I got spiffed up to go to the jazz club where Rodney was playing.  It was really nice.  Get this...IT WAS A NON-ALCOHOLIC CLUB!!!  THEY DIDN'T HAVE ALCOHOL!!!!  Anyways...later that night before we left, the head of the band Rodney was playing with announced that they have a special surprise....Well...The band started playing happy birtdhay and the waitress brought out a small cake to me.   The whole club was singing...it was funny and wonderful...it was so sweet...I was like ""yay Rodney.""

So, afther they played happy birthday they went into a more jazzier version of happy birthday.  Then, if you thought that was enough.  We came back home where Christopher and Chandra surprised me an ice cream cake from Baskin Robbins.  My family sung happy birthday to me as I blew out the candles. THAT WAS SOME GOOD CAKE!!!   This was a very special wonderful birthday!!!

First thing I hear Christopher's girlfriend says is ""are you sure you paid the electric bill?""  lmao...black people...so anyways...as the power is out...Rodney and Chris suddenly gasp....I am thinking something major happend due to the power outage and they weren't going to be able to do something...So, some to find out...Christopher and Rodney are just found out that since there is no power, there is no way they can do their NFL Draft for PlayStation II.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................so...I was just disconected because i'm on dial up modem and Chris tried to dial up in the other room...he is giving me until 9:30 to type this because another NFL Draft is going to be done online......................................................................................................................................................................yeah....so...as I was saying....Rodney and Chris were planning ways to try and get to downtown Manhatten to use the internet cafe' down there.  They were prepared to walk three hours to get to downtown Manhatten.  Chris is sititng beside me right now counting down the seconds I have left on the computer...Anyways, what they didn't know is that the power was out in Manhatten, too....HA!  Dumbasses!  So...they realized that Chandra has a lap top and that they can do the NFL draft on the lap top....so...they were extremely happy.....here we are w/o hot water, food, electricity, and AC and all they care about is NFL draft....*sighs*  So I have just been informed that I have 2 more minutes...oops...one more...so I guess I'll go..."

"event","lmao...for all of you who watched the show Good Times growing up.  I am still in NYC.  CAn't seem to get a plane out of here.  Everything is backed up because of the black out.  I was supposed to leave Thursday morning but obviously the electricity was out.  Couldn't get out Friday morning.  Waited in line 4 and half hours early this morning hungry to get to the front of the line and find out I can't fly out and might not be able to fly out tomorrow either.  Ahhhhhhhhhh!  Like I love NYC but for vacationing purposes only...I can't stay in this tight packed city over an extended period of time.  

Yeah.  So here is the situation with my boss.  Right after the power outage occurs.  We only knew that it was three states so far from the radio.  New Jersy, NY, and Michighan.  So, like the nice, responsible employee I am I call into Toys R' Us to tell them to schedule someone else because I am stuck here.  Lucky me gets the bitchy ""in acting"" Manager...not the real Manager...but the ""in acting"" Manager, Melanie.  I tell her the sitatution.  Keep in mind the news hasn't gotten out yet that there is a blackout.  She says ""three states with power outages, Dana...You expect me to believe that, RIGHT!  You are supposed to work Sunday and you need to be here...if you aren't here, then you aren't here!""  And that was it I said ok...bye....Bitch....Needless to say...she got shamed when she went home and turned on the 11 o'clock news.  So, yes, the ""real"" Managers, Melanie, and I are goign to have a discussion when I get back because I am tired of her shit.  There is much more to this story...anyone who wants to know...call the cell...it's too much crap to type.

So, I might go home by bus or train Monday if we can't get out Sunday.  My parents are thinking about driving up to come get Rodney and I if we can't get out tomorrow.  Why does drama follow me?

If you want to know some stories about fights in the aiport happening because people are mad about their flights...give me a call about that, too!  I have nothing to do."

Then, I went to the STrom Thurmond Federal Building so that I could get a new Social Security Card.  The lady there just completely skipped over my number.  I was number 62....she went from 61 to 63...I was like what?!?!  So, I just had to cut in and be like look you didn't call my number!  I forgot to go visity the Wellspring people about getting our apartment sprayed for bugs.  I guess I will do that tomorrow morning.  Then, Amster and I went to go apply for my credit card at the bank.  Like <lj user=""brandipoo""> said....""I am a grown @$$ woman!""  So, I decided that I didn't need my parents permission to get a credit card!!!  I am about to turn 22.  I can get it myself.  Now, I am coming into my own independence people.  I am almost there.

So, Then I went to work from 4-9.  Fridays are always busy.  Some guy comes in and tries to buy $800 dollars worth of toys and writes a check for it.  The check doesn't go through.  So, he held up my line for 40 minutes...YES 40 MINUTES!!  I coudln't check anyone out.  Because our manager waS trying to see why his check wasn't going through because he claimed the money was in his account.  I say he had problems and he knew that the money was not in the account.  Oh well...some people just don't know.  

Carmen has gone to visit her nephew for three days so that leaves ""Honey Bunny"" in my care.  I might just leave my door and CArmen's room door open tonight so that Honey can feel free to roam so that I don't have to hear her whining or scratching.

So not to bore you on how other things are going in my life on a deeper level...so since I learned to use LJ Cut...you can <lj-cut> about that right here Everthing has been going pretty well...I have been attending my counseling sessions and taking my medication.  I have been looking at things in a posititve way...""don't worry about the past, live for today, hope for the future.""  I am just learning to enjoy each day as it goes by and learn to stop dwelling in the minor things.  

I openend up another checking and savings account at Fort Jackson thanks to Mrs. Smith.  Now, so that I can have my own kind of financial security w/o my parents knowing or them dipping into my account w/o me knowing.  I feel bad for doing that, but those of you who know, know my situation.

So about this religious thing.  I am very excited about it but very nervous because I have no one to go to church with on this Sunday.  But that is ok because I can do it.  I can do things on my own I don't need others, and God will be there to help me through it because he wants me to follow him, right?  So, no worries.  Just do it!! 

My social anxiety and fear of the public has gotten extremely better.  I can now hold ""real"" conversations with men.  Sometimes, I wonderf if I am being too much like myself because I don't want certain people to think I like them.  Then, I have to tell myself that is just my charming, sparking personality and I""m not sending a wrong message.  I'm just being me!!!  So, hopefully the 30-40 year old man at my job won't try to pursue anything with me.  The thought was nice Amy and Carmen (ya'll know what I men), but that's just a No, NO!  </lj-cut> if you choose to...

So tomorrow, my plans are breakfast with my lovely friends and roomates Caucasion Carmen and Korean Amy.  *giggles*  Then, I must go to the Strom Thurmond Federal building to get a new Social Security Card because I am tired of the hassels I get by having a photo copy.  Then, I must go register for a new Voter Registration Card because both of those items were stolen from my wallet last year, and I never went to get new ones.  Then, it's work from 4-10 at my wonderful place of employment, Toys R' Us.  I am not being sarcastic when I say that either because it is a wonderful place to work.  I love my job!!"

"event","I've been really thinking about this for the past two months...I talked it over with my counselor today which is actually the first conversation I have ever had with someone about this subject of religion.  I am highly considering going to First Nazereth Baptist Church (a church that I really liked and felt comfortable) and getting ""saved"" (I guess that's the term I should use)...I always thought what would others think of me if I went towards teh religious side because a lot of so called Christians are judged by others.  Right now when I really need something higher and spiritual in my life, I just really need to feel a hollow space that has been inside of me for many years.

I used to have trouble believeing because I have always been a scientific person.  But just like anything I have to learn and grow in my faith with more knowledge.  Going towards a more spiritual side doesn't mean that I have to give up the things I love.  I just want to have like Quentin said ""higher standards"", something to believe and something that believes in me.  I pray.  I really pray hard.  A lot of things I've prayed for has happend.  Other things I know I must be patient for because the bible says if you ask him, you shall receive....and I should trust in the Lord right?  This is something that makes me very nervous and scared...but also closer to peace and happiness at the same time.  It doesn't mean that I am going to be a different person, just going to be a better person.  So, this is something I am seriously thinking about.  What do you think?"

"event","Well...I have been doing so well for the past month...I haven't been depressed in a long time.  It's rounding my birthday and I will be 22 and it will be another year of not every dating anyone.  I guess I starting feeling sad when I went out to Babys R' us with Carmen's brother and sister in law and their son Ryan...I saw how happy they were and how sweet Ryan was and that is something that I want in the future.  It doesn't seem like I will be getting that.  Then the night before I went out to dinner with Justin and Amy and even thought they debated over tihings the hold time I envied them because it was cute and I want someone to argue with like that, too.  Then I found out that another two persons I know just recently got engaged.  And I feel l ike what is wrong with me!  I feel undatable and I don't realize why no one that I would like to potentially date has taken interest in me.  I'm sorry the people that like me or just people that I would never EVER consider dating...wouldn't even give them a chance.  

I don't know what to do.  I've forgoten about being single until the past two days.  I just want someone who loves me.  Someone who I can spend time with.  I am happy with the way I am.  It what just be tnice to have someone to share my happiness with and to make them happy.  Everyone is getting engaged and what not....I mean...I don't want to be married anytime soon, but I would like someone to spend time with and talk to."

That's ok though because I am thinking optimistic theses days.   So...got off of work....went to dinner with Brandipoo and her friends from high school days....that was exciting.  I can tell that things are getting better because my social anxiety has started to lesson around people.  Then, I went to Banana Joe's with Charlene and two of her friends.   That was fun!!!  I haven't seen Charlene in ages it seems and I haven't been clubbing in forever.  So, I could try out my new dance moves.  Saw Jessica Little, Erin Smith, and John Gowan.  I also saw a co worker of mine out in the club.  He was telling everyone at work today that ""I was getting my freak on at the club.""  I was like whateva Cedrick...I had to laugh because I couldn't deny that.  I'm starting to meet ALL differnet kinds of men.  Like for instance, Charlene's friend who tried to get me to sleep with him the whole night.   Yeahhhhhh!  The only thing he got to do was dance with me.  I was like that's as far as you're going.  Then, as we got back to Charlene's place he wanted to go swimming.  At 3 a.m. in the morning.  I was like, I'm not getting my clothes ruined.  So, he says ""just swim with your bra and underwear.""  Hmmmmm...let me think...HELL NO!!!  It was nice getting to dance with lots of different people.  I even got in some time with John Gowan before he left.

So, I had to work on the 4th of July.   Grrrrrreat!  It was fun though because I love my job!!!!  :-)   I arm wrestled my boss today.  I won, but I don't think he was trying that hard.   Then, I went to the Smith's house to have some bar-b-q...yum, yum!!  Yay for Mr. and Mrs. Smith's cooking.  See, my family abandoned me and went to GA.  So, I went to my second family's house.  Carmen's my sister!  :-)  *giggles*   Now, for the greatest news of all.   YOU ARE READING THE JOURNAL OF THE NEW FITNESS INSTRUCTOR AT STROM THURMOND WELLNESS CENTER!!!!!!!!!!!  HELL YEAH!!!  Starting this Fall I will be assisting with classes and getting certified to teach my own group fitness classes.   So, you must come to my class because I plan on being a kick ass instructor!!!!  I'm going to whip your ass in shape!!!   :-)"

"event","Well...it all started when I decided to go to the SOM to practice my flute, roller blade in Finely park and so on....I am driving on I-26 when, because of STrom Thurmond's funeral, traffic is being block in downtown and things are slowing down.   Now, remember it's raining....so I put on brakes so that I could slow down along with trraffic when my car decides to hydroplane.....WOW!!!   Lucky enough I am a very calm driver under panicky situations.   So, I just remembered the rules of hydroplaning and kept turning my wheels the direction the car was hydroplaning.   My car did a complete 360 on the INTERESTATE!!!   IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC....I was on the far left lane, too.   So, my car came in inches of misses hitting the concrete barrier.   Lucky enough my car hydroplaned in a cirlce or I would have hit the car in front of me.  Lucky enough I was in the left instead of middle lane so that I didn't hit cars to the righ tor left of me.   Lucky enough the people behind me had the sense enough to brake their cars when they saw me hydroplaning.  All I can remember is thinking 'so this is how it feels to hydroplane.'   Then after it was over...I backed up my car turned around and kept going.   I can't believe I was facing traffic when the car stopped.

So, then later I called my mom when then I got panicky and scared because I couldnt' believe that had just happend.  So, my parents are on the way to get my car and leave me with the ALTIMA...HELL YEAH!!!  POWER!!!  They think something might be wrong with my brakes because it wasn't raining...the roads were still wet, but it happend when I braked.   My wheels have been having trouble lately.  So, WOW!!!!  I am very rattled for today.  Lucky enough...I have friends like Quentin who cheer me up by oddly laughing at me in this situation.  Thanks a lot Q!  *shakes head at you*   So, anyhow....I later went roller blading at Finley Park....and my roller blades were too big so I had to go exchange them for a smaller size.  Now,  I am home out of the rain until my folks get here.  Ta ta for now!"

"event","Okay...so you as my friends know me really well... .you know I wouldn't mean any harm by any of this...but I have decided that I am sticking to my race when it comes to potential men that I would like to date.  My reasons for this.  For me, I just think it will be simpler and less complications.  I do love my black men.  I look at my father and brothers and they are very strong, intelligetn black men.  Now, that I am in the middle of finding myself, I find myself going back to my ""african ways"" if you want to call it....like the going of the natural....and other things...I find myself becoming more and more like my brothers fiance'....she is one of those woman that is all about being african american....and also...dating someone of my race will be someone I can relate to about many subjects.   I just love R & B, and hip hop too much....I would want someone who shares that interest, too.  Someone who loves to go out once and a while and go to an R & B club or something....So, I've decided I will not date a white man.  Am I wrong for this?

So, anyways....I think there is this woman at work who is a lesbian....and I think she likes me...usually my instincts or right....hmmmmmmm....maybe I shouldn't have cut my hair....she's a really nice person though...she's crazy...but it's a wierd situation...but I won't jump to conclusions because I don't have any facts...so anyways...."

"event","I've been thinking about myself lately....I assume too much...and I've learned most importantly about myself to trust my instincts, because they have been correct so far....I stumble upon this realization with an interesting conversation with Ms. Creamer....She knows where I am coming from...too bad you don't!!!  *devilish laugh*....so anyways....like I was saying...I am continuing to learn more about myself and my problems.  Now, that I know what my problems are, I can tell how I will react to certain situations....like something came up ealier today when I was talking with my Creamer and I knew that it was something that was going to totally get my emotions out of whack....so I reacted fast...I got out of my room and went to Finley park and walked around with my mom....

Of course I shed about 4-5 streams of tears....but it was ok....because I've shed so much more than that...and this time I understood why I was crying....I cried that little bit....got over it...and then the streams from the water fountain calmed me down...it was actually peaceful....I really have to buy and camera and go out to Finley park and take some pictures with my friends...I have pictures of no one....So...I will be grabbing you guys like crazy so that I can get pictures with you....Linda, I guess I'll have to wait till you get back to Cola.  So continuing on my early conversation....now I know I ponder on things so I am working on moving on....it's been working so far....

I have learned so much about myself...now that I knwo what I'm dealing with....I don't want to kill myself....I never have wanted that....what I want mostly is a future...I want to teach elementary school....I want to have a family someday....I want to live life to its fullest....I want to get involved with children as much as possible because I love them so much....I love myself...there are some things that I might want to tchange about myself but for the most part....I love my life...I love the friends in my life...through the good and the bad.....they have always been there...and I couldn't have asked for better friends....except CArmen...that girl is kind of off....but anyways....like Amy said ""you have to learn how to except the bad things in life so you'll appreciate the great things that come along.""  

I might not be the most glamorous person on the planet or the most shapely person...but DAMNIT I AM ME!!!   I am great,  I am a loving person, I have a heart of gold, and I love making other people happy.  I need to be selfish for once in my life and contain some of my happiness for myself...you know...share the wealth w/o making myself bankrupt....I love myself!!!   And until someone comes along who is worthy enough to have me, then damnit you don't deserve me!  Because I am beautiful inside and out and if you tell me any differently then FUCK YOU!  I know who I am.  I am a strong black woman, who is intelligent, caring, fun-loving, and creative.

My next project I'm working on is learning how to rollerblade...I've always wanted to learn...so I bought a pair today..must got get knee pads and crap....I will bust my ass...but you have to work hard and bust your ass at anything you want to do in life....""Life is good, all the time, all the time, life is good....AMEN!"""

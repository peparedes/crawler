"event","Oh yes, ADVfilms did it again! I can't believe they dropped the evangelion anniversary pack project. After all the money saving I have gone through, all I will get is a nice sun exposition since ADV has left me hanging in the yard again. I feel so desappointed.
On the other hand, Does anyone of you know where I can buy the 4 volume of Peacemaker Kurogane in japanese, I mean this version:

not this one:

It must have international shipping since I live in Panama. Also it would be great if the shipping cost were rational :p"

"event","Hi everyone!
What a weekend hahahaha. This friday was my first obstetric turn, it was exiting but I ended up so tired -_- that now I have a cold. I feel so bad T_T
I also went to the Anitour in Atlapa Convention Center. I think that the organization was pretty lame, so a message to the Rurouni-Slayers group: if you are going to organize an event please be more serious.
Tomorrow is my obstetrics SUAGO rotation speak so wish me luck :p

ADV films will release this anniversary pack of Neon Genesis Evangelion which includes a lot of extras:
+Contains every video extra ever created for Evangelion
+Special commemorative art booklet
+Limited-edition EVA 10th anniversary jacket
+The Notenki Memoirs autobiography
+Neon Genesis: Angelic Days manga
+And more 
My favorite is the jacket.
So this is my new obsession. I have already began to save my money because is quite expensive _-_
I hope ADV don't screwup as with Peace Maker Kurogane...

In other subject, I feel that today is not a very happy day at least for now. I don't know I just feel tired of the routine. This week ends my period of practice in a pediatric hospital, and is very far from my house so my sleep time has reduced a lot. Maybe that is the reason of this feeling.
Hopping for better days. Bye"

"event","I think we, all Peace Maker Kurogane fan's, have been very patient with ADV. How can you guys be so cruel. If you are not serious about releasing PMK then let other company do so.
This post is to all PMK fans out there, you can take this big signature and fix it to the size you prefer, hope you like it.

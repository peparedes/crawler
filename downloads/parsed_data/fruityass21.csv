"event","When you try your best, but you don't succeed. When you get what you want ,but not what you need. When u feel so tired, but you can't sleep. Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face. When u lose something you can't replace. When u love someone, but it goes to waste. could it be worse?
Lights will guide you home, and ignite your bones. i will try to fix you. 
Up high above or down below, when you too in love to let it go. 
and if never try you'll never know, just what your worth. 
lights will guide you home, and ignite your bones. i will try to fix you.

I wish there was someway for me to forget all of this pain i feel lately. so heavy the past seems. i can't rasie myhead up high anymore, i feel so wrthless. I can't stop crying. I wish i could have what i want. i wish what i wanted was what i needed. i want someone to fix me, is there anyone out there? 

I feel so lost here, now. I am nothing without peace. 

please help me..."

"event","Okay so this is my first entry, well that I can remember. I don't have as much to say as some of you Kat's dew, but @ least this might be interesting to those who know me best(unlikely, but there is always hope). 

What do you say in things like this?, um.. I like toast....I haven't had sex in a really long time and I think it's starting to wear down my brain cells. I like picking my nose on tuesdays and I haven't washed my ass today. 

I listened to this really great Springsteen song today, AKA The BOSS, what do you suppose he is the Boss of? Is it really bad hairdo's or is it best impersonation's of Bob Dylan? I am going with option 2. 

....I hate people, I work with some of the biggest dumb asses on the face of the planet, I think that the IQ level of most of the people that I talk to can't be much larger than their shoe size. It is so amazing to me, how disinterested most people are in the fact that they can't do simple math.(working in a credit union will do this to you). 

well that is all I have for the moment, I am sure that if you have read all of this you have decided never to come back, and that's great. Fuck you very much...and for those of you who are really dull and decide to come again, fuck ewe as well....

peace"

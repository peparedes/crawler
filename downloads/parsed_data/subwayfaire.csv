Might be a good time for me to switch providers, anyway, so I'm researching family vs. indiv. plans, and phones appropriate for an older guy whose eyesight and patience for complicated things aren't legion. If you've got advice or experience in this area, please post. 

He wouldn't need a lot of minutes, or a data plan, but I do so I don't know if you can mix-match on a family plan, or if I'll need to get him his own account and phone. Bills would be sent to me, so addresses in different states wouldn't matter. I'm also considering getting the hell out of sprint, so doing a switch at this time would be pretty convenient for me. (and yeah, considering another relationship with Apple). I love my treo, and it only's been acting up very recently, but Sprint's been an absolute cunt about billing me for a closed, years-old account. Is AT&T actually better than Sprint? I'm pretty bitter and need some phone co. love."

there's another poet from around the same era as dorothy parker, who kind of reminds me of her. Of course, I can't for the life of me remember her name at the moment. Elizabeth Somebody. Her poem that describes MY current state of mind is:

""My pencil's dull, besides, I think
I really ought to have a drink.
and as I go to get that drink
(my pencil being dull) I think
I might as well go down the hall
and get it sharpened, first of all
For how can anybody think
Whose pencil's dull, and needs a drink?""

You never used to come home from work with neat factoids about databases."" I pointed out that there are no neat factoids about databases. Don't let anyone tell you differently.

One thing I like especially, though, is an independent study program I've been involved in. They say that the best job security comes from exploiting opprtunities to learn new skills in case you ever have to get a new job quickly.

tragically, I'd forgotten about the worst withdrawal symptom: my darling failsafe caffeine is wrecking me. ""Continuous caffeine consumption with smoking cessation has been associated with more than doubled caffeine plasma levels."" says the Journal of Addictive Behaviors. I'd forgotten that I ALSO have to quit my beloved morning double lattes, just when I'm totally mastering the foam art. I simultaneously want to cry, tell everybody to fuck the hell off, leave work and take a five hour nap because I can't sleep at night, and, apparently, write twice as much in my lj than usual. Ug. Who's got the tranquilizer dart gun? and why won't my landlord let me have a dog? seriously, canine love is the only thing that's worked for me in the past.

Generic quit smoking literature says only ""limit caffeine intake,"" not the more useful ""limit caffeine intake or risk severe cartilage injury from knee jiggling, and grievous harm to your loved one's feelings, especially if they are *also* quitting smoking and do not know that they've unknowingly having doubleshots the whole time themselves.""

Yes, I do have the Nicorette. It helps, but trust me, it's not the same.

"event","I haven't written lately, because it seems like every time I have something to say these days, it's bitch/moan, bitch/moan. health, job, apartment, life path. . . spin the wheel and I've got a sob story for you. 

Advice on how not to be a whiner and still get one's myriad needs met will be grudgingly accepted. It's for my own good.

here are some good things that have happened lately:
 -- joined freecycle to start getting rid of some of my white elephants, er, clutter. 
 -- had a nice date with nice girl who seemed to like me, at *least* enough to hold my hand during a scary movie.
 -- soaked in D's hot tub for (cumulative) hours on end, then basked in the glow of their TV for (again, cumulative) hours on end. mmm I'mmelting...
 -- found something that removes the railroad spike (ie ideopathic stabbing headache|cluster headache|paroxysmal hemicrania|whatever the f they think it is) from my noggin, at least temporarily. 
 -- realized that the TCM was doing nuhsink for me, thereby saving me much time and money.
 -- marveled at some of the outright gorgeous views our little patch of the universe has to offer. 
 -- marveled at some of the outright gorgeous people our little patch of the universe has to offer. You know who you are.
 -- got over my recent hair disaster and can go out in public again.
 -- had a nice evening with B and G (and then a nice cracked-out breakfast, and lunch, and drive, and my god is it that late already?)
 -- heard about my beautiful peeps in LA getting their beautiful bebe out in the world. boy is he in for a real treat.

oh ps. did I tell you? psychology won the personality vs. career battle. religious leader, ski instructor, and forest ranger were right up there again, too, but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't support my rock and roll lifestyle. I'm pretty sure I won't want to go into doing therapy though. Because then I'd have to deal with PEOPLE. And their stoopit fuckin PROBLEMS.

yes, I'm kidding."

"event","Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles strikes yet again. the story so far:

1. I move from MA to CA (5 years ago this May). change my license and registration stuff in CA, and called MA RMV and my loan company to change my address of record.
3. I pay off the car loan (finally! this past August).
4. I wait around for the title of my car to come in the mail (end of August to present).
5. I call MA RMV to say WTF. They tell me that the title was sent out ""fahevah"" ago. After some pressing, they mentioned that they sent it to my 1st address in CA, so it should be back at their office soon for forwarding. (yeah, right.) I can apply for a duplicate if I want, but I'll need another letter from the loan co. saying we're square. (end of September).
7. I change my address with both MA RMV and the loan company. Again.
6. I finally get the letter from the loan company, yay! I attach 25 bucks to it and the duplicate title request form, and I'm on my way (this month).

ok, so what do you think is the next *logical* piece of mail that I would get from them?

Anyone?

""Dear ----, 
Your driver's license expires on 3-28-05. Please complete this form and bring it, along with your driver's license, to your nearest RMV branch office or to a convenient License Express location.""

It's been 5 years, people!! and yes, they had *both* my california and cambridge addresses on the form. 
Both, I tell you."

Is this not just the least bit, um, I dunno, obvious? Like, you're cold? try a sweater! always feeling rushed in the morning? Wake up earlier! Feel like you're in the wrong profession? Look for a new job! (*cough cough*)

Some hot tea with honey will clear that cough right up!

grrr.

I'm always willing to try some new trick to get over insomnia, but I'm glad it's not my tax dollars at work to produce this study. I do envy those researchers, though. ""Here, I'll put on these ambient tracks and you just take a little ol nap there. Comfy? Good. Let me know when you're asleep and whether the music helped."" Sounds like a pretty cushy job to me.

"event","there's this psych test that you can order through your local psychological professional, ok, it's a career test really, but it's more in-depth than, say, the Myers-Briggs which you can take on the interweb. the Cambell Interests and Skills Survey works like this: a hundred or so questions about, given certain tasks, which ones do you like the sound of. not which you think you're good at, but the ones that you would, given the opportunity without regard to paycheck, skill, or life circumstances or whatever, think you'd enjoy doing.

then it asks the opposite: what tasks are you good at? no matter if you've never done them before, but if you did, what things would you (think) you'd have a natural ability for.

then you send it away and some machine chews your answers and compares them to those of folks in a variety of professions, and sends back results in the form of ""4 out of 5 plumbers answered these questions much the same way you answered them. therefore, you are like a plumber."" It gets a little fancier than that, talking about what areas you should explore and avoid or take a class in or start sending your resume out about, but that's the basic gist.

Last time I took it (about 10 years ago) my putatively optimal career choices were, in no particular order except the one which stuck out as really the most ideal thing, which I'll mark with an x:

psychologist (duh)
animal care specialist
forest ranger
guidance counselor
ski instructor (what??)
and
(x)
spiritual leader.

so why am I here 10 years later, no pets, skis, or thriving plants in my apartment, with only a cultural familiarity with religious thought and speech from sunday school years ago and 8 long years of technical writing and editing on my resume? what happened?

well, of course what happened is that I had a lot of college and personal debt so I went for the thing that would pay my bills that I knew I could reasonably do. Not really any of the things that I really liked, that I knew I'd be good at.

So? college loans finally paid off in November. Car loan paid off last august. I just took the CISS again last night, so we'll see what happens. 

If I get spiritual leader again, I swear to god I don't know what I'll do, as I'm pretty much agnostic.

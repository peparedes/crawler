"event","So we have the police over the road at the park near here. There was an ambulance too and a man who was either completely unconscious or dead.

When they wheeled the stretcher into the ambulance, the sheet was pulled all the way up. Also, when it left it had neither lights nor sirens and appeared to be in no particular hurry, I'm guessing he was probably dead. Looked kinda like a homeless guy, so hopefully it was natural causes and not foul play.

Regardless, I'm really creeped out."

"event","So it's now going to be 3 weeks at least before we can even get our own phone line connected at this house. 3 weeks, when the original quote we were given was ""Disconnect Monday, reconnect Tuesday."" God knows how long after that it's going to take to get the ADSL sorted here. Maybe August or September some time at the current rate.

Now I understand that the previous tenant not bothering to disconnect is not iinet's fault. This guy was apparently a douche/on the run from debt collectors/the law/dead/whatever. That being the case, a short delay would have been acceptable. Still a pain, but acceptable.

However, Zar spoke to 4 or 5 different people at iinet and not one of them told him that all he needed to do to get the ball rolling was send them our proof of occupancy. That's not just one person who maybe didn't know, but several who either didn't know or didn't say. He had to get a number and speak directly to Telstra wholesale himself to get that information (where, incidentally, the first person he spoke to knew exactly what to do.) 

So once iinet had that paperwork, it took them a full week to actually act on it. A <b>week</b> before they even bothered to send it on to Telstra to be processed. And even that only happened after another email to iinet asking them what the status was.

I know excellent customer service has never been something you seriously expect from iinet, but this is absurd. When you've got a stable of operators who don't seem to know their arses from their elbows and Telstra (TELSTRA!) is outperforming them, you know something is terribly wrong. 

I've worked in customer service. I know sometimes things fall by the wayside or get buried under a bunch of other problems. I know some days you just can't be cunted with any of it and you try to put the difficult stuff off until tomorrow or palm it off on someone else. I get that, we're all only human after all.

But it seems like iinet employs failed Raelian clones or viagra-popping bonobo chimps with ADD in their customer service department, because iinet has been absolutely shocking the whole way through this problem.

I think one more stupid delay and it'll be churn time."

The giant, ridiculous kind where you look out of the mouth. I want it to be bluey grey with big googly eyes and a custom lure with an interchangeable LED in it.

"event","Drackir is heading back to Port Hedland today. We'll miss him and his moglette, Spike. Getting up at 7 in the morning so we would take him to the airport was pretty painful though. 

Anyway, here's another of my little darlings, Smokescreen. He's based on a 2003 (I think) model Subaru Impreza WRC.

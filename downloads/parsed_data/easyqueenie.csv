"event","Tonight be my first night on the magical easytour.  I be muchly excited as it has been sounding truly wonderous.  Thanks to everyone who has called and texted from the previous gigs to keep me informed of their happenings.
Tonight I'm bringing along 2 friends for their initiation into Easyworld.  I prey this is a good gig to introduce them.  Especially as this is only the 3rd gig one of them's ever been to!  I'm also hugely impressed by the 360 degree rotating piccy on the easyworld site ( www.easyworldinfo.com .)  Would be better if you could see Glenneth though! :op

This weekend I've been at my old friend Merran's house in Glossop (a small town in the middle of nowhere, well the Peak District.)  There was much madness including buying a new dog called Storm who lives up to his name.  This makes 3 golden retreivers they have in their not-so-large house, well they had 4 a few years back!  We mainly sat watching videos, tv, dvds and playing her playstation 2.  I love Spyro!!!  I am also now the proud owner of a copy of ""Forever Delayed"" the Manics photo book which is making me very happy.

I've now TEMPORARILY moved in with Scott.  So if you wanna post me stuff for any reason use his address.  This is til I get the money etc to get my own place up here.  Talk about the best friend you could possibly ask for!!!!!  And just to back him up on what he posted on his Livejournal, no we are not a couple!
Love you all,

I was sat talking to Nicky on msn and Scott was reading Harry Potter when I noticed movement in the corner of my eye.  Looking over I saw a large spider crawling along the wall.  I gasped out of suprise and Scott asked what was wrong.  I told him there was a spider and he leapt up onto the sofa looking for it.  I found it and asked if Scott was ok, he said he would be provided the thing stayed in the corner and didn't move.  About a minute later I saw it run into the centre of the room, I told Scott and he leapt onto the sofa and stood there looking terrified.  I asked if he wanted me to get rid of it, he went bright red and said yes.  So I got him to open the backdoor and then he looked at the spider and went and hid in the downstairs loo while I took it into the back garden with the help of a letter and a glass.  When I came back in he was stood in the lounge looking extrememly embarassed!  Cute beyond words!!!!!"

"event","This is a genuine psychological test. With some very interesting results.

It is a story about a girl. While at the funeral of her own mother, she met this guy whom she did not know. She thought this guy was amazing, totally her dream guy, she fell in love with him right then and there but never asked for his number and could not find him. A few days later, the girl killed her own sister.

Question: What is her motive in killing her sister?

<LJ-cut text=""Answer, don't read this until you've come up with an answer to the question."">

Answer: She was hoping that the guy would appear at the funeral again. If you answered this correctly, you think like a psychopath. This was a test by a famous American psychologist used to test if one has the same mentality as a killer. Many arrested serial killers took part in this test and answered it correctly. If you didn't answer correctly - good for you. If your friends hit the jackpot, may I suggest that you keep your distance. (If you got the answer correct, please let me know so I can take you off my e-mail list......unless that will tick you off, then I'll just be extra nice to you from now on!)

Just so you know, I got it wrong!

"event","Today I am nursing a collection of painful injuries.  And no I didn't get them as Nicky suggested by having a ""night in with Scott.""  Last night I saw the wondrous Kinesis at their ""secret"" Manchester show along with Scott, Dale, Sean and their friend Alex(I think that was her name.)  That moshpit was the most violent and hot I've ever been in.  By the end of the night we were dripping sweat (the ink on Sean's t-shirt had run so much all the writing had blurred almost beyond recognition.)  Only me, Sean and Alex went into the moshpit, Scott and Dale stayed at the back.  So far back Scott couldn't even see the stage so he sat through the set on a random chair.  How Dale saw anything amazes me, I imagine he stood on the spare amp at the back.  I had to go home and get a shower before Scott would even let me in the bed!  You can't see any bruises but my head is killing me cos I was kicked there several times and had my head slammed into a pillar a few times too.  However, it was worth it!  Definately one of the best gigs I've ever been to and I survived the mosh pit to get on the front row about halfway through the set.  Shame the support act, Miss Black America, were so bad but their set gave me time to read the mini Kinesis fanzine that the band had produced.  I didn't bother trying to talk to the band cos everytime I saw them they were surrounded by adoring fans clamouring for autographs.  I got a big smile and a wave from Conor though which was nice cos I thought he would have forgotten me by now.  Tom, Neil and Micheal obviously recognised me but couldn't place where they knew me from.  hehe.  Anyways will stop ranting now and instead show you the best pictures.  I've got some more, if you want them just ask.

Shelley bought me underwear.  I got loads of knickers in Topshop which will keep me going for ages.  She also bought me a matching set from Gossard which were expensive but gorgeous.  I am an awkward bra size so I find it impossible to find matching underwear unless I buy it from ""proper"" bra shops.  Especially as I refuse to wear thongs so even when I occasionally do find bras that fit the chances of them having matching knickers in my size that aren't thongs basically equals none.  This equals expense but as Shelley understands I can only buy expensive stuff she's fine paying out every so often (plus it's not actually expensive to her as she has money!)  Sadly we went shopping after Shelley had finished work so everywhere was shutting.  This means I have to wait for the other stuff I was gonna get in Ann Summers (nothing kinky!) but I can do waiting, I wasn't even expecting to be able to get the stuff!
After shopping we went for a drink and a cake at the nice little coffee shop in the hotel that most people don't know about so it's quiet.  Luton can be nice when you know where to go!  
Now I'm hot and tired and should be revising but am watching the last episode of Buffy instead.  I am so confused cos I haven't seen it all season.  For instance, why is Xander wearing an eye patch?  And why is Dawn being more of an annoying brat than normal?  Hmmmmm

I'm a happy bunny!
A VERY happy bunny!!!
The reason?
In my exam today there was 1 question on a topic I'd never been taught.  I left it to the end but had a few spare mins.  I decided to come up with something completely random to fill the space cos I'd always been taught that if you write something (even if you think it's bollocks and have no idea what you're on about) you're more likely to get marks than if you leave it blank.  So I rambled some complete shite for a few lines.
Just got back and am discussing the exam with Tom, my friend who knows scary amounts about science.  He told me that what I wrote was actually the right answer and that I should get at least 1 of the 2 points available!!!!
So there you go everyone, just ramble shite if you've got spare time!  You never know!

So yeah, the title sums it up really doesn't it?  But why??  I'll tell you!  On Thurs (not *technically* the weekend but, meh,) we saw Radiohead and they were ABSOLUTELY FUCKING STUNNING!  They played ""No Surprises"" which made me very very happy and their new single ""There There"" sounded amazing live.

On Saturday we went to town and sat in a pub to watch the Division 3 playoff final because Lincoln (Scott's team) were playing Bournemouth.  We lost 5 - 2 but seeing as how Lincoln can't afford to move up to division 2 it was probably for the best. :)  (Look at me acting as if I know what I'm talking about!)  In the evening Scott's parents came round and we watched Shrek on dvd which was fun as we all love that film.  Scott's mum and dad rock!  
On Sunday we all got up late and headed off to Ikea where such fabulous things as ice cream scoops, toilet role holders, lights and chairs were purchased.  We took a diversion on the way home and had a gorgeous roast dinner and the pub down the road.  Then we came home and vegged out in front of the sofa for the rest of the afternoon (with a nice bown of Carte D'or cookie ice cream I might add!)  Scott's parents headed off back to Lincoln around six and not long after me and Scott left for Pizza Hut.  One good meal later and we wandered into the cinema where we saw the Matrix Reloaded.  It was absolutely amazing but we both agreed that it took a while to get going and some of the fight scenes were a bit *too* long.  I'm definately going to see it again as I have very little idea what actually happened, it was tres confusing!
Monday came and again we woke late and quickly headed off up north to Middlesbrough.  We found Dale and Ali before going for some food (which we later regretted - it took ages and was pretty crap when it finally arrived.)  Then we set off for our first band, The Delays as recommended by Dawn.  They were very very good, Scott described them as ""Busted if they played good music instead of that pop crap"" or some such similar wording.  Next up were the Bandits who also rocked, soon followed by the Darkness who were definately one of the best bands there!  We saw Hope of the States (yay!) next who were beautiful if a little shocking (how many people do you *need* on stage at one time?)  Then we saw Biffy Clyro who were dire (sorry to all the Biffy fans but we just thought they were boring as hell.)  Last of all were Easyworld!!!!!  They were absolutely stunning and played the best rendition of Other Man I've ever heard.  Til the Day and Don't Expect were beautiful as ever and Bleach had the audience going mental!  Lastly we were treated to a new song called ""When You Come Back I Won't Be Here"", it too was amazing and made us desperate for more.  After the show we got to talk to the band etc for a good 2 hours.  Scott and Dav entertained us all with their double act, anyone who didn't know us must have thought they'd rehearsed it, it really was classic!  We heard many rumours... *cue spooky music* (no, I'm not gonna tell you, hehehe.)
Last night we summed off the excitement by seeing the 22-20s.  First band (possibly called Clearlake but we're not sure,) were ok.  Second on, The Blueskins were absolutely amazing and blew away everyone there!  After that the 22-20s were a bit of a downturn (and seemed to be in a bit of a strop too.)  They were ok but I don't see why the music press is kicking up such a fuss about them.
But yes, long entry.  Sorry :-)

"event","So finally, after countless years waiting, I'm seeing Radiohead tonight.  I can't wait!  Am going with Scott, it's his first time seeing them too so he is equally bouncy.  People I've spoken to who've already seen them this tour tell me they're amazing.  They've also been playing No Suprises which is one of the three songs I've been praying for; the other two are How to Disappear Completely and Planet Telex.  I'd love to hear Street Spirit too but apparently they don't play that one often and as for Creep... hahaha like there's a chance!
So today I've played most of the Radiohead albums.  I don't really like Kid A so I stopped that one halfway and I'm gonna ask Scott if we can play Hail to the Theif in the car on the way there.  We're meeting my old friend Colin at the venue, it'll be nice to see him again.
Away from Radiohead, Scott gave me a few pressies when I got here.  Namely the Bell X1 vinyl I asked him to grab me, an ""easygirl"" badge and a ""whore"" badge to go with my ""junkie"" one.  All shall of course be worn to Middlesbrough on Monday.  Another gig I'm *really* looking forward to.  Today I found out that Hope of the States, The Bandits and The Darkness are playing so I'll be dragging Scott along to them (though I feel I may be the one being dragged to HOTS!)  This adds to Easyworld who we were already seeing (obviously,) The Delays who we've been told to see and I'm hoping to catch the end of the Biffy Clyro set.  Saint Rose are playing but I wasn't that impressed with them supporting King Adora last year.  Also Keane are playing so I shall be avoiding the Play Stage when they're about (if you don't know, don't ask!)  I'd have liked to see Junior Senior and Reef but HOTS and Easyworld easily take pole position over them, oh well.
Ok, enough ranting for now, Scott's almost home so we'll soon be eating.
Love ever,
xxx"

"event","Yay!  Have had fabby weekend of greatness!  For those who don't know, I spent this weekend in the small village of Bovey Tracey in Devon with Barry (DeepestDarkestDevon) and his many friends.  Gay sex, screaming at 4am, evil EVIL alcohol that some people were convinced was fairy liquid and Daniel Beddingfield made for a good time.  As did the large consumption of alcohol.  It was fun beyond words.
Also, Scott's bought my Easyworld tickets so I'll be at Liverpool, Leicester, London, Manchester and Sheffield.  I might go to Northampton too.  Can't wait!
Haven't got time to write much more so I will just say:
I LOVE YOU LOADS BARRY AND SCOTT!!!!!!!!

"event","Yes.  It's finally happened.  I'm not going to get into a long rant about how much they meant to me and how good they were etc cos it's not worth it.  All I will say is that I've been a Mansun fan for 7 years so you can imagine how much I've grown to love this band.  I'm simply grateful for the times I've got to see them play live, the music I've spent hours upon hours listening to and the chance I had to meet and talk to them.

One good thing has come of this however.  I texted my sister to tell her and she actually REPLIED!!!!  She hasn't replied to a text of mine all this year.  It's a small step, but a step forward nontheless."

Tomorrow night I have an interview at a college in Manchester.  I'm not good in interviews, I tend to freeze up :(  Luckily I'm seeing friends afterwards so that should make it better.  
I have to apply for another college as I don't actually want to go to the Manchester one now, that's just there for backup.  Applying means getting references, predicted grades etc and... writing a personal statement!!!!  Bastards!
My first exam is 3 weeks today and I don't feel like I've done nearly enough revision!
I haven't even started flat hunting yet and I have to move up north in early September at the latest, preferably late August.
Tons of school stuff.
Although it's not vital, SPCAM hasn't been updated in ages and I feel terrible for not reviewing half the gigs I've been to recently and all the demos I've been given by various little bands who if I'm honest, desperately need the promotion!

Not updated much recently cos of lack of internet.  Well I have it back now (yay!) so I can update.  
Spent last week doing many many fantabulous things.  On Tuesday me and Scott went to <a href=""http://www.saltaire.yorks.com"">Saltaire</a> to have a look around.  It's a small village so most people won't find it at all interesting but it was built by my great great (insert random number of ""greats"" here cos I'm not sure how many there are,) grandfather so I wanted to see what my family is responsile for!  It was really lovely.  We fed the ducks on the canal, had a look round the village and visited the David Hockney galleries in the old salt mill.  All in all it was really enjoyable, Scott seemed to have a good time too which I was happy about cos I didn't think he'd be too pleased to have me drag him round some boring Yorkshire village.
On Wednesday we drove down to Luton.  We spoke to Shelley for an hour or so before getting ready and heading into London.  I successfully navigated the tubes to Shepherds Bush and then we went for KFC and McMinis before heading to the Empire and settling into our seats with a drink.  We had amazing seats.  The support acts were really really good.  Tom Baxtor and a Mexican couple with guitars.  Damien on the other hand was ABSOLUTELY FUCKING STUNNING!!!!!!!!  Definately the best concert I've ever been to!  The old stereotype of something making you laugh and cry came true.  The classic story of The Wee Boy who was Wee Bit Pissed Off came out and had us all crying laughing.  A bit later I was crying properly at Cold Water (I don't think Scott noticed me sobbing - probably a good thing.)  I honestly cannot believe how good that gig was, I doubt it will ever be surpassed!  I also can't believe how much I love Scott for introducing me to the wonder of Damien!
Thursday and we went to London in the morning.  I took Scott to the Tate Modern in a vain effort to culture him - it didn't work.  Instead I ended up giggling my way round it trying to stop him loudly commenting on how ""that's not art - that's crap"" and ""I could do better than that!""  Soooooo embarassing!  Then we went to Liverpool St station where I attempted to impress him by telling him it was where Mansun filmed Taxloss.  Again, it failed!  Then I suprised him by taking him to Kings Cross and showing him where bits of Harry Potter were filmed.  He wasn't as impressed as I'd hoped but definately appreciated the effort.
Then we headed to Camden.  Lunch was had and record shopping started.  We spent many hours flicking through racks of vinyls, cds and going through the many many markets.  After we'd tired ourselves out shopping we headed to Whetherspoons for a lovely meal.  Then we went to Tottenham Court Road and spen the remaining half an hour in Virgin awaiting Karen and Nala.  When they arrived we quickly found our seats in the Dominion Theatre.  The Queen musical was also ABSOLUTELY FUCKING STUNNING!!!!!!!  The plot line would probably sound stupid if I tried to explain it here so I won't.  It was so much fun though, especially the parts where it turns into a giant sing-a-long!  As I'll never get to experience the wonder of Queen live, I'm making the most of this as it's the closest I'll ever get.
Friday and it was Scott's birthday!  We got up about 2pm and he opened his cards and pressies.  We went to town and bought a few bits before going back to Karen's flat.  That evening was his suprise party.  Although not nearly as many people showed as I'd hoped for he still had a good time.  We got the people in Pizza Hut to bring out his brthday cake with candles on after our meal and he got all embarssed as we sang happy birthday (he buried his head in his arms on the table - bless!)  After the meal we came back to our house and Scott had a few drinks.  Then the conversation got on a bit of a downer so we excused ourselves and snuggled on Shelley's bed watching Friends videos.
Saturday came and we got up late and made Scott's easyboy t-shirt which fucked up so he left it here.  Then we went to London and joined the others for a picnic in Soho Square Garden.  After about an hour we started feeling a bit left out so we headed for a pub.  We had a drink there and then decided to go to Whetherspoons where many many drinks were consumed along with some nice food.  At 9.30 we left for Stay Beautiful.  Navigated the tubes successfully (only just due to drunkenness.)  Scott seemed to enjoy SB, I spotted him dancing and singing along to a few songs.  I really enjoyed it too, got up and danced on the podium with Nicky, Richey and Adz for a few songs which was great fun.  We got in at about 2 after meeting Karen at the station and me and Scott went straight to bed as we were exhausted.
Sunday we got up late, went for a meal and then Scott left.  I cried lots and then Karen made a cake and we had lots and lots of fun!
See - told you it was long!  Am currently really looking forward to this Thursday when I get to stay at Scott's house again!  Yay!

"event","So we're back from Scott's parents a day later than planned due to the shops we wanted in Lincoln being shut.  We have returned with goodies that I will leave Scott to show off about.  
Had a great Easter weekend doing...well... very little really.  We got to Lincoln at lunchtime on Saturday, got some food and went to the market to see his mum and dad.  Chatted for a while then went for a look round the town.  We went to the Cathedral and castle where it was stupidly windy, saw the Roman well and Scott's fave pub and various other sights of Lincoln.  Went to a record fair too but didn't get anything.  When we'd finished we drove to Scott's parents' house where we were well fed and we all settled down watching the re-make of Planet of the Apes.  It was good but not as good as the original.  Elliot was lovely, even though Scott did insist on attacking him on random occasions.
Sunday we went to the shops to buy some things but they were all shut so we decided to stay overnight and go today.  Had gorgeous Sunday lunch courtesy of Scott's mum then we all vegged out on the sofa with the Grand Prix for the afternoon.  In the evening we dragged up some energy and went to the Railway social club for a drink.  There it was decided to visit Scott's auntie Diane and her sons Jonathan (13) and Matthew (8) who proceeded to beat Scott spectacularly at a board game, much to the amusement of the rest of us as Scott moaned his way through the game.  We were given chocolate before heading back to his mum and dad's house. They went straight to bed but me and Scott stayed up watching TV for an hour or so (he's allowed to stay up late now he's a big boy!)
Today we got up, went to the shops then headed back home.  Not particularly interesting. Was a brilliant weekend though!  Highlights were:

The Brown Family Portrait (that's a great shirt Scott's wearing!)
The kiddie photos and Scott's mum's attempts to get the albums out, only failing due to Scott's desperate protesting!
Scott repeatedly being told off by his mum for annoying Elliot when he was asleep.

Will go off and leave you all now, hope you've all had good Easter's too!
Love ever,
xxx

I'm sure it will be fine though as I have been assured by both Scott and Vikki that they are lovely.  Vikki thinks she will be disowned and replaced by me and soon as their dad realises I'm a Queen fan anayway!  And I get to meet Elliot the cat too which I'm looking forward to as I love cats.

"event","I've just had my heart broken.  
My sister moved house a few months ago and never told me.  I've just found out today.  Add that to the way she never replies to my texts or emails and you get a pretty clear picture of what's happening.  I've lost her and my neice and my brother-in-law too.  I've lost them!!!!  I can't cope with this.  My neice Izzy made me the happiest I'd ever been and now I've lost her forever.  I don't know what to do.  I can't live knowing that she's out there and I can't see them.  I knew they didn't want me around and that everyone was lying to me.  I knew it!
I hate myself."

"event","I just found out Cerys Matthews is playing the Union Chapel!  She's got a few more dates lined up across the country too, I can't wait!  The new album's out on May 19th so I'll have to make sure I have plenty of cash that week as I'm getting a train to Manc for Radiohead that week too!  So much fun!
I'm going to a gig tonight.  Scott came home from work with tickets yesterday.  The headline are called The Burn who I've never heard of but we're going for the support.  They are Bell X A, Damien Rice's old band.  Scott played me their album last night and it's really pretty so the gig should be highly enjoyable.  He also came home with both cds of Athlete - El Salvadore for me because he's a sweetheart. *hugs Scott lots*
It's not fair that he has to go to work today.  The weather's really nice and we could've gone out into town and sat in the sunshine together.  He so didn't wanna get up today, ended up leaving late because he just couldn't drag himself up. :(  Meh.  At least he's only gotta do it one more time then 10 days off!!!
I had the most horrific nightmare I can ever remember having last night.  It was that someone called me and told me my grandad was dying and that I should call my mum and sister to see what was happening.  So I did and they told me that he was in huge amounts of pain and being taken to the hospital for an overdose of morphine.  Then they told me not to come over cos he didn't want to see me again and they didn't want me there.  That was what made it so bad cos I've had dreams of people dying before.  I woke up in floods of tears at about 5am.  Scott cuddled me tightly until I fell asleep again.  Weirdly he was cuddling me while I was on the phone in my nightmare too.  Even my subconcious knows I can rely on him!
Looking forward to seeing the northern boarders on Friday and having much fun and frolicks in the Trafford Centre together.
Love ever,

"event","I know I should be revising and when Scott reads this he'll shout at me for not working but I had too much energy and needed to do something to get rid of it before I could settle down and get on with anything.
We've been having a lovely time together so far.  Scott's sister is lovely and seemed to really like me which is always good.  Her boyfriend is also lovely, in fact the whole group we went out with on Saturday were great people.  I was highly amused by a bloke called Speedy (an old school friend of Scott and Simon's,) simply because he was called Speedy!
Other than that night and going to Moonies on Friday, we haven't really done much.  Highlight of yesterday was going to Morrisons for food.  I bet you can hardly control yourselves from the excitement eh?  Well we've been enjoying each others company too much to even notice that we're not doing much.  
We finalised our Easter weekend plans yesterday.  Friday we're going to the Trafford Centre for the day because Scott's not been there yet and I wanna go to the fairy princess shop and try and drag him on the dodgems.  Looking forward to going to the food court there.  For anyone who's not been there, it's designed like the front of the Titanic and has a big pool in the middle.  Tis one of my favourite places to eat!  Saturday we're going to Lincoln.  Scott's gonna take me around and show me where he grew up: old school, childhood house etc.  We're going to his parents' market stall and anywhere else interesting he can think to take me.  We're staying over with his mum and dad Saturday night and spending Sunday with them.  Scott's crawling for a free meal and wants his birthday presents.  We're also gonna hopefully see Moonies in Nottingham on Sunday night because Ryan said if I texted him that day he'd guestlist us and I trust him for some reason.  Hopefully we should have a good time anyway!
Well I'll be off and start working!
Love ever,

Ps, We have Cava (Champaigne that hasn't been grown in the Champaigne region of France for those who don't know wines,) and strawberrys in the fridge! ;)

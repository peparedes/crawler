wat a horrible day tim got evicted and i hate where i live they evicted the today at 1:30 and he wasnt even allowed to find a pair of socks they weren't in the house five minutes they were told to leave and its bullshit because the managers originally told them they had thirty days and then three days later they show up with 7 sheriff cars and say you gotta get out if they come in the park again they will be arrested for trespassing they sat in front of a store from 1:30 until 5:00 in this hot ass weather they have two dogs and they had them chained to poles and were sitting on the window sill to the store when tim called me i ran up there and stayed with them the whole time and i got them a two liter of soda and water for their dogs and i let them use my phone so they didnt have to waste their money on the pay phone the park managers wouldnt even let them wait for their two kids danielle and jamie to get out of school and they had no clue they were even evicted because janet didnt want to tell them because they are only twelve and she didnt know how to tell them so me and tim had to jump a fence and i ripped my pants which sucked but anyways i stayed at a distance for tim to tell the kids when they got off the bus and it was the saddest thing ive ever seen in my life danielle just stood there and cried and hugged tim just think wat they did to those people they have four kids and two dogs fourteen dollars to their name and no place to go everyone was crying including me ive known these people since i moved here they were my first friends i love them to death and now they have to move to indiana because they have no place to go and i hate this its not fair i feel like a good person tho for all the ways ive helped them danielle and tim and everyone was really worried about losing their puppy gunner because they can only take one dog with them for now so i offered to hold him for them and they said it would only be one night so i went to walk home and my sister found me and said that my dad siad if i walk through that door with the dog he was going to take him to the pound i dont understand how people can be so heartless you know its just one night so i walked off and sat behind a church on a parking spot thing for about two hours crying with no place to go not knowing wat to do and i had to pee so bad but i had to hold it becasue i cant go anywhere with a dog to use the bathroom so i called a few people and went to kennys house and found out kennys gone for five months and that they wont take it so i went home and got kicked out i was left to walk in circles around the streets and cry until tim called me and told me where i could take him so i took him to shantals and i finally got to go talk to joey which i was really really happy about becasue tim told me when the cops came and told them to leave joey put his shoes on and ran nobody knows where he is but me and before i found him i was so upset i thought i was never going to see him again but our talk went really well he told me he loved me and he wasnt going with his family and hes not going to leave me even if it means he has to hide for a little while and hes getting a job which im so proud of him for and i think things are going to get better tim moving isnt going to get better becasue i love tim hes one of my bestest friends hes like family and i love his family ive practically lived there this whole time ive been in florida and i dont know i had the worst day and the best day ever so before it gets even more fucked up im going to call it a night"

"event","My Horoscope

It's time to put your life on pause and escape. Go on, take a hike! It's time to walk in the park, gaze at the ocean and otherwise reinvigorate your senses with what really maters. Fresh air and wide-open spaces are a requirement right now. The quiet will help you take stock of all that's going on in your life. Once you're grounded, you'll be better able to tackle the challenges that are waiting for you later.

i think i just might try and see if this helps.

lately has been crazy. My dads been in the hospital, he had two surgeries last week. One monday, was home tuesday, then back in the hospital wednesday for another surgery. If he would have waited just one day, just til thursday he would have died.  worst thing ive ever witnessed. he was allowed to come home yesterday. He has to be very careful and clean his, well cut i guess youd call it, otherwise if the infection returns its more than likely no one will be able to help him. also i have two jobs now tuesday through saturday i go to school, straight from there to my new job, and at four i stop working and walk down the sidewalk to hungry howies and clock in. talk about no break. except saturday i dont have school and tuesday i dont work at hungry howies. dont take this as complaining the extra money is really helping a lot. it can just be tiring . it keeps me busy though and my mind off of things that worry me and i enjoy that. im signing up to do some voluteering to fill in a little more space in there. but for now i think my horoscope has a great point. 

sorry i havent kept in touch with anyone. ive just kind of stayed to myself lately to try and build myself back up. let me know how you guys are doing"

Hold me
Even though I know you're leaving
And show me
All the reasons you would stay
It's just enough to feel your breath on mine
To warm my soul and ease my mind
You've go to hold me and show me love

Give me 
Just one part of you to cling to 
And keep me
Everywhere you are
It's just enough to steal my heart and run
And fade out with the falling sun

Oh, please don't go
Let me have you just one moment more
Oh, all I need
All I want is just one moment more
You've got to hold me and keep me

Tell me that someday you'll be returning
And maybe
Maybe I'll believe
It's just enough to see a shooting star
To know you're never really far
It's just enough to see a shooting star
To know you're never really gone

Oh, please don't go
Let me have you just one moment more
Oh, all I need
All I want is just one moment more

Oh, please don't go
Let me have you just one moment more
Oh, all I need
All I want is just one moment more
You've got to hold me and maybe I'll believe

So hold me 
Even though I know you're leaving

This reminds me of Dave so much its funny because everytime he tries to leave i never want to say goodbye and he knows it so he'll sit in his car with me in front of my house for like an hour every night and just hold me....i love it well my good mood didnt last long heres a funny story i dropped my cell phone by accident in the toilet and completely ruined it its like a 250 dollar phone that i got on sale for 70 dollars by chance and since im a genious i lost the warranty card a long time ago and was lazy and never tried to do anything about it so now im paying for it big time considering im broke because this is the slow season at my job and i dont get any hours anymore which means no money and im suposed to be getting my brothers and sister school clothes and supplies but thanks to talking to jana i can finally laugh at it if it werent for her i would probably still be cussing my toilet out, screaming, crying and kicking the bathroom door......i feel a lot better now"

Surprisingly i have outgrown my shyness im&nbsp;pretty outgoing now compared to the silent years i spent in goochland&nbsp;well.....&nbsp;i have a job down here&nbsp;ive been working here since october of last year its a pizza place called Hungry Howies i dont think theres one up there but anyways its the best thing thats happened to me besides the preschool program the people I work with are awesome going to work isnt even a chore for me theyre all like family to me here is where I met dave my current boyfriend of eight months who is everything i ever dreamed of and more i thank god everyday for him i feel unbelievably lucky to have him but enough mushy stuff and now that im thinking about it just so you guys know i dont have bangs anymore thank god and my hair is kinda blond but you can ask anyone who seen me last summer i look ten times better im not saying im hot or anything cause im not conceeded but i would say its better.....anyways more about florida one the top two things i love about florida is as you can tell the beach at night not during the day but at night and the fact that i get to go out every night granted i dont have my license not til october but lucky for me all my friends do i just recently had my 16th birthday on june 16 and my friends threw me the most awesomest birthday ever my boyfriend, his step brother, my boss , and his wife all paid for me to go to a spa and have a massage facial manicure and all that good stuff and for someone whos been just asking for a break for&nbsp;awhile now it was amazing the people there wouldnt even let me put my own hair up&nbsp;i couldnt believe it&nbsp;then i went horse back riding because i havent rode since i left va and i really miss it then i was surprised by all my friends at my friend jt's apartment and he lives in a college community so there was just people everywhere and we had a blast..cant say i remember everything but it was awesome lol fourth of july is coming up and i know its going to be kick ass but i have a long day ahead of me ......and no im not up this early usually i just didnt sleep all night so i could write this for anyone who has missed me, thought of me, or hell even if you were bored and read this whole thing i hope it was a little interesting ill be updating this often hopefully that away anyone who wants to know how i am will now have the chance so it doesnt seem as if i disappeared of the planet thats all for now..........</P>"

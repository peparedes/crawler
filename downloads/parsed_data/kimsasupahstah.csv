"event","For the last few years all of my goals, thoughts, and plans revolved around two or three central ideas. Recently, I realized that way of thinking is getting me absolutely nowhere. 

I work hard in school and try to get good grades; am I any closer to graduating? No.
I work two jobs to help pay for this schooling, and one of the jobs is supposed to help me in my career. Am I any closer to this career? No.
Do I even really want to be a teacher? No.
I put in five years of love and devotion and selflessness into a relationship. Am I any closer to getting married? No.
I make most of my decisions based on my possible future with this person. Do I get the same consideration? No.

Nothing in my life has really changed in the last five years. Everything is the same. I've been working for change, willing it to happen, doing everything I can to make some kind of transformation in my life; but still, nothing. I have watched the lives change of everyone around me. People graduate, start their careers, get engaged, move out, get married, etc. I'm stuck in the same place. I feel immobile. 

I need to reverse my thinking. My goals and plans should involve only me, without empty reliance on others. I need to make things happen. Perhaps I should cancel out all my goals and just live day-to-day. Maybe I should go to Europe for a month or two. Maybe I should quit school and travel. I could get a full time job and move out of my house. Anything. I need change. 

I have the most monotonous life in the world. My life does not make me happy. I guess it's up to me, and only me, to change things around. I'm tired to being me; I want to try someone else on for size because being me clearly isn't working out."

It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did? 
Was it something you said?

Don't leave me hanging
in a city so dead
Held up so high
With such a breakable thread.

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be.

You were everything, everything that I wanted.
We were meant to be, supposed to be,
but we lost it.
All the memories so close to me just fade away.
All this time you were pretending,
So much for my happy ending.

You've got your dumb friends,
I know what they say.
They tell you I'm difficult,
but so are they.
But they don't know me,
Do they even know you?
All the stuff you hide from me,
All the shit that you do.

You were all the things I thought I knew,
and I thought we could be.


You were everything, everything that I wanted.
We were meant to be, supposed to be,

It's nice to know that you were there,
Thanks for acting like you cared,
And making me feel like I was the only one.
It's nice to know we had it all,
Thanks for watching as I fall
and letting me know we were done.

He was everything, everything that I wanted...
We were MEANT to be SUPPOSED to be, but we lost it.
All the memories so close to me just fade away.
All this time you were pretending.
So much for my happy ending."

Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free

Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

Someday at Christmas we'll see a Man
No hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care

Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shinning moment my heart ran away
From our world today

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Take hope because your love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

"event","For the past few months, I have felt extremely blue. A lot is happening. My crazy sister wants to get married to a guy no one has met and move away, leaving me all by myself. My dad hasn't been well and is getting a really scary heart surgery, and I don't really know how to feel about it. Should I be happy that he's getting something done that may help, or should I be scared that it won't work, just like the last ones didn't?
I feel like I'm standing still when everything inside of me is screaming for me to progress forward. I want to be proactive, I want to propel into my future. I want to graduate this year and be able to pursue a career. I want to be move out of my house and I want to be married. I'm not saying I need all of these things to happen right now, but I feel like none of these things are going to happen EVER. I feel like I'm just stagnant. A lot of my friends are finishing school this year, but I had to take time off because of transferring, plus I changed my major twice, so I still have at least another year after this one. My close friend, Becky, and I made plans to move out together next September, but she's getting married that month so I don't think that'll work out. She's really the only friend I can imagine living with (besides the one that lives in PA) I always considered myself to be a motivated person, and I've never been content with being unsuccessful. I feel like I'm only happy when I'm getting something done or when I feel like I just did something worth while. I haven't done anything to be proud of in quite some time, and it doesn't seem like anything new is going to happen any time soon. I'm just stuck. I'm stuck where I am. I'm UNHAPPY, and I have been for quite sometime. 
So, now is the time. It's time to make things happen. It's time to take as many classes as I can, work two jobs, and get things done. I can feel more content with taking longer to graduate if I know I'm doing everything I can do get there. It's time to question where my life is heading. If I'm in dead end situations, it's time to GET OUT! I'm so done with living in the now. It's just not who I am. I want to live for the future. It's time that I make my self happy again. I deserve that.
The only reason I'm even writing this is because I need to let it out, but I really have nobody to talk to about it. My best friend lives far away and is really hard to get a hold of. My friends here all seem like they're really happy and they're moving forward and making advances. While I am happy for them and proud of them, I feel weird talking to them about how UNhappy and UNsuccessful I am. I especially feel weird telling anyone about my dad, because they either have nothing to say (who knows what to say, really?) or they say something stupid. (like, won't that ruin his new tattoo?) I can't talk to Mark about it, because I feel like it's insensitive or something. I also can't talk to Mark about moving forward because he has NO IDEA what I mean. He lives for the now, he's content not making any future plans and doesn't understand why I need to set goals and make those types of plans. I feel lost and lonely and like I'm failing in life.
I need to make things happen.... here's hoping"

Jewel

I was thinking that I might fly today
Just to disprove all the things you say
It doesn't take a talent to be mean
Your words can crush things that are unseen
So please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
And I'd like to stay that way.
You always tell me that is impossible
To be respected and be a girl
Why's it gotta be so complicated?
Why you gotta tell me if I'm hated?
So please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
And I'd like to stay that way.
I was thinking that it might do some good
If we robbed the cynics and took all their food
That way what they believe will have taken place
And we can give it to people who have some faith
So please be careful with me, I'm sensitive
And I'd like to stay that way.
I have this theory that if we're told we're bad
Then that's the only idea we'll ever have
But maybe if we are surrounded in beauty
Someday we will become what we see
'Cause anyone can start a conflict
it's harder yet to disregard it
I'd rather see the world from another angle
We are everyday angels
Be careful with me 'cause I'd like to stay that way"

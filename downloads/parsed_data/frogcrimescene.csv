school's going well. i saw carolyn yesterday! i went into manhattan to get an id but the place was closed, so instead carolyn, her friend debbie, and i went wandering around. we went to cbgb but the bands were finished playing for the night. so instead we went across the street to the bowery poetry club(?). it was interesting. when we walked in these two guys were rapping at each other(i'm sure there's a name for that, i'm too white to know....) about bush and the convention. when they were finished we got drinks (a $7 whiskey sour? good thing i'm a lightweight...) and watched this band. there was this guy on trumpet, and his microphone had this awful reverb and then...he started to sing. we decided to leave at this point cause we were finished with our drinks and listening to this band kind of made me feel stoned, but not in that good way. so, we went back to carolyn's. she lives in a salvation army hotel. WAY poor. but it's not that bad. but then again i don't have to live there. i slept there for the night and came home in time for my 11:15 class.

now? i have homework :( sometimes i forget that college involves work..."

this morning gretchen and i had our golf lesson. we both didn't go last week so it was our first time going and i was pretty sure we were gonna get our asses yelled at (thanks to the multiple nasty e-mails). 

the lesson was suppossed to start at 10:45 but we didn't end up getting there till noon. our driver didn't show up, but then he did. then we went with him to get the van, but after walking through 
the entire campus we couldn't find the van. but then we found it. meanwhile, the entire time gretchen was in dire need of coffee and a breakfast sandwhich from good old dunkin donuts. 

so,the lesson was pretty good, but my hands hurt. plus, we were outside for most of the time and my nose was runing like crazy. it was all very attractive. me and my terrible golf swing with my runny nose and messy hair. i'm sure the boys were taking notice...
at any rate, we finally made it to dunkin donuts and gretchen got her breakfast (at 1:00)

now i'm here in my room and all i want is summer. or at least spring. the weather needs to warm the fuck up or i'm gonna go crazy.

"event","in the process of logging in to write this journal, i think i've figured out what has been bothering me for awhile now in regard to james and our whole relationship. i just got off the phone with him, and after mustering up some kind of courage (i hate to use that word but i cant think of a better one...) i told him some things that were bothering me. basically that i miss him and i am fustrated that i'm far away and can't see him etc. i dont know if his intent was to make me feel guilty or like an asshole or like an overbearning girlfriend, but he managed to make me feel like all three. maybe it was because he's tired, which i understand. i can't completly relate with getting up at the crack of dawn, but i do know he's tired and i can at least sympathize. maybe he doesn't realize that both of us kind of cancel out any kind of good we're trying to do to acommodate our completly different schedules.

bottom line:
james has told me that he feels like i understand him and why he does things, but sometimes i think he doesn't understand me. at all. and honestly, i don't know if i could tell him that at this point. i wish i could.

i'll finish this later, i'm just gonna talk to gretchen"

i have to finish filling out my schedule for next semester within the next 2 hours. i better stop writing in this. or not.

a lot of stuff has happened but i'll just stick with interesting things. 

i feel like im going through a relapse in homesickness. i dont know what it is. but i really feel like i shouldnt go home so much because, yeah its the best feeling knowing that you're going home to good food, your own bed (james' couch...whatever), and personally i get to see my sister and james and my dog..and my parents ;), but its the worst feeling when your on the train (or 4 in my case) home and all you want is to go back. so, i'm here till thanksgiving. and i guess i'm glad in a weird twisted way. seeing everyone, and being home will be that much more special. so yeah.

i did go back to the wc this weekend though and it had it's moments. got kinda drunk on friday and accidently gave james a hickey, which i feel bad about. but it was really small and i don't really remember doing it...my aunt came over on saturday night and i was made to feel guilty for not staying home. issues with my mom and aunt dont stay inside. we vent. in public. not in a loud obnoxious way but i still hate getting teary eyed in restaurants. cried a bit when i got home, but i think everything will be fine. dad was understanding as usual. :)

i hope james doesn't think i'm being clingy. he'll probably read this at some point, which i think is good. i'd want him to. but yeah...i just feel like if we don't talk, then when we see each other it'll be awkward. i'm so scared of that. i just feel so forced trying to come up with something to say (on the phone or online) so that it feels like we're somewhat together. when we actually are physically together just being there is enough. we don't have to fill every silence. :\ i just love him a lot...i get nervous...

i had fun with aunt karen...for the most part...she made me feel like shit at one point...she wants me to be a strong woman (woman...ha,right) who doesn't rely on men. i swear shes not a feminist, or at least an angry stereotypical one. and excuse me but, I DON'T RELY ON MEN! that feels good to let that out...

i had too much iced tea...i'll be back later..."

"event","i'm back. mom and dad dropped me off. before i could even think mom started putting clothes away and cleaning stuff up. i think she just has to touch everything in the room so she feels better. like she straightened up as best she could. lol

i had an awesome weekend. i came home on friday night which was a pain in the ass. the subway, then penn station, then trenton, then philly, and finally home. james came and got me. it had only been a week but i felt like it was so much longer than that. i wanted to just run over and give him a big kiss when i saw him but i have this thing with pda's. he kissed me anyway. you know you're happy to see someone when they're wearing the one shirt you don't like, but you think it looks great. or not...whatever, the point is i was happy to see him. 

the whole weekend was amazingly great minus much of saturday night, but only cause i'm a big baby and can't communicate what i'm feeling very well. plus i was tired and didn't want to admit it. but sunday night was so wonderful. having good conversations are the best. :)

leaving this morning was not as hard as i thought it would be. it was still really hard but it was definetly more optimistic than it was a week ago. i just want to have fun now.

i may go out tonight. class tomorrow :( boo"

computers will be so easy and french wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. everyone seems to be at the same level, which is basically we haven't taken french in at least a year.

i actually have a paper to write, i should probably start that...

so i have one more class today. it shouldn't be bad at all.

i'm having trouble here. all i can think about is how much easier i would have it in west chester. i'd have friends, my sister, my boyfriend, my family...i have nothing here....

starting over will be so strange. i've never had to do that.

: develop pictures (from prom(!),and disney (back in march)

: get tan dammit (i'm considering the 6 second tan thing again, even though it sucked and made me smell like fritos until i took a shower.)

: <del>laundry</del>

: organize clothes (ugh, this will be tough. katie and i share a lot of stuff...)

: get stuff together for james' birthday

: organize dorm stuff

: <del>go to work on tuesday</del>

: call roommate (again)

none of this stuff seems too difficult, it's just the matter of having the energy to do it.

"event","i went to nyc with james yesterday (i guess it's 2 days ago now). quite fun. we basically walked around all day and just stopped wherever we wanted to. we had dinner at this hawaiian place where they give you a lei and serve drinks in tiki glasses. the food was awesome too. if you're ever in new york it's 101 east 2nd street. you'll see it cause of the 2 huge tiki posts outside. 

then we watched part of <i>a rasin in the sun</i> in bryant park. if only we had known people make picnics and have dinner out on the grass there we would have been more prepared. but we had ice cream, and since the empire state building was only a few blocks away we went up to the top. it was so beautiful and just a very nice end to the day :) overall it was an amazing time. i just should have worn more comfortable shoes ;)

i got my roommate and dorm assignment for next year. her name is nicholle (wow two l's <i>and</I> an h). according to her zip code she's from new hampshire. plus i got the nicest dorm, with a/c. word.

i think i have mono...i find out thursday."

"event","wow. I haven't updated in a long time. i figure math class is the best time to do so though, don't you think? a ton of shit has gone down since the last time i've written. 
there was prom, which was interesting to say the least. frank was quite a gentleman though. he's a great date. whatever girl he ends up with will be lucky. i just really really do not like him like that. yeah, so i had a good time with him. 
then there was after prom which was a good time as well. i won a microwave so i too can make soup and hot pockets.
james and i are together now. i fucking hate when people ask if i'm ""going out"" with him. something about that phrase makes me think of middle school and all the bullshit that went along with saying you were ""going out"" with someone. but i'm happy and he's great and that's that. :)
i should be reviewing for my test...meh..
what else is there? i guess nothing, i'll edit this when i get home if i come up with something important/funny."

i'm grounded. i think i am at least. my mom thinks it's dumb for me to stay home but my dad thinks it'll teach me to plan better or something. it doesn't matter much anyway because i'm working every night till 10. saturday i don't work though and i think i can go out.

"event","WHAT NAME WOULD YOU RATHER BE NAMED THAN THE ONE YOU HAVE?
for 18 years i've had to get used to the name i have so i'd like to keep it. but if for some reason i'd have to name a kid right now for a girl it would be audrey and for a boy it would be aidan. (or something completly unoriginal. i haven't decided)
FAVORITE ART MOVEMENT OR PERIOD?
impressionism
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ARRESTED FOR LEWD CONDUCT?
no, but i'm sure one day...
FAVORITE DRUG?
wow, wouldn't be cool if i could actually answer that question?
WHAT ANIMAL ARE YOU MOST LIKE?
hmmm...someone think of a really small,indecisive, annoying little animal. because that's probably the one that i'm most like.
DO YOU CHECK YOURSELF OUT WHILE PASSING MIRRORS? FOR HOW LONG?
that is probably my worst habit ever. it's not even mirrors anymore. it's anything reflective. and it's not even like i'm checking myself out. it's more like ""what can i fix?"". then i get all paranoid.
IF YOU COULD BE WITH ANYONE RIGHT NOW...WHO WOULD IT BE?
i'm inclined to put someone meaningful and important here, but i can't think of anyone. i kind of like hanging out by myself right now...
FAMILY FEUD OR WHEEL OF FORTUNE?
ah, definetly family fued. even the really really old episodes. i fucking hate pat sajak. ok i lied. i don't hate him. he just looks like a squirrel.
FAVORITE/LEAST FAVORITE WORD?
favorite word ""yes"" least favorite word ""no""
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU SLEPT WITH?
if by slept with you mean sex? that would be zero. but physically sleep? a lot of people. note to any guy who secretly wants to share a bed with my sister: she hogs the blanket and snores like crazy.
DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE LOCH NESS MONSTER?
yes. i'm pretty sure it's the horribly unfriendly mother of a girl i know...
NAME 5 ASPECTS THAT MAKE UP YOUR DREAM BOY/GIRL?
<i>sense of humor, ability to argue/debate with me intellegently, has his own life, eyes, and taste in music.</i> that was devin's answer but it's so perfect so i'm keeping it there.
IF YOU COULD SAY ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT TO SAY TO SOMEONE YOU ARE TOO SCARED TO SAY IT TO... WHAT WOULD IT BE?
you make me feel like a different person when i'm around you. and not in a good way."

(if u kno wat im talkin about good for u if u dont than u dont really kno me i could say...) 
i miss him so much like i remember that day like it was yesterday ...it pisses me off...he was the only one who cared,then... he truley loved me then in the most time i needed him ...they took him away...wat did i do to deserve that?
at least i have,her,now but i often wounder wat will i do wen they take her from me? i have nightmares about her never coming back ...i dont think i'd be able to go through that again i wouldnt be stroung enough i mean wen i lost him they sent me to fucking therapy or w/e the fuck u wanna call it ....they said i was depressed ...no fucking shit really? srry but i dont have any one to talk to for this subject no one would really understands ...sumtimes i still cry about that day March 28...now i dont belive in ""God"" but...there was sum reason she was born the day after he died.

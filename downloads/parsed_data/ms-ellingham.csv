Just a few things i wanted to say though, first off..i think im getting a cell phone. No biggy to the rest of you but hey, ive been wanting one for a looong time now so im stoked to say the least. Today was the V, JV golf banquet and i gotta say it was actually really fun. The team i was on won the scramble! a little props to me i guess- Number 6 at wild wood, we used this one kids drive and then i hit a 5 wood 230 into the green and then made the putt for an EAGLE! so yea we ended up 5 under par after 7 holes. After that round, we got to chow down on sum damn good hamburgers and hot dogs followed by sum awards. I was kinda reluctant to go to Knights at stocki's house but hey, i made a promise to go so i went and i lost really quick but it was cool cuz i just played halo against Minger aka. Ming Way via. Stocki's Xbox Live. Work tomorrow, followed by GOLF DEMO days at BIG OAK with anthony hopefully then i dunno, i guess i might be doing somethin with a bunch of cool kids later. </P>

Fantasy baseball is a total success as I'm sitting in 5th and ready to pounce. Right now AJ (i'm never updating my team) Abraham is in first.

For all of those who havn't heard yet, TJ had an awful showing at knights, Rich won again (atleast hes good and addicted), and Long probably had a couple of bad jokes which he played off. 

JV LACROSSE WON IT'S FIRST GAME FRIDAY! 8-5? WERE NOW 1-8... and well on our way to a .500 season. If anyone out there is interested in being our #1 fan tell me. The spot is open. Hey Rich, you can't get any other job, just be the number one fan!

Dominicos is off the charts where I met a black guy who gave me hooch. This guy is fucking crazy! TK, we finally have an easy hook-up, (not drugs...), and last night was so busy that Jeremey Andreano had dishes as high as him.....true story.

Other than that tho lifes been good, over break i got darker than most everyone that actually paid to leave rochester to go to warmer climates...to get a tan that didnt stand up to my own. O yea...the general consensus on that tho was that...""SCOTT SHUT UP!!...YOUR ASIAN!!""-k guys like i didnt know that. However, i missed a lot of people over break, i mean i was literally deprived of sum of my best buds! friggen Ike left, Anthony, Kyle, Brandon, Rj, Bobby, i mean that was harsh. and also, i was feelin sum heartache when mband left to cuz hey i love'em like woah, i aint gunna lie. (def. missed the scary movies...even if someone likes to spoil them for me.) but as much as i was missin everyone that left, i had a pretty chill time here with all the cool kids that stayed. AKA. Rich, Doug, Long, Matty, Tool,&nbsp;Proukou, Graham, Serena and sum others.

"event","In light of hearing of a gay-straight alliance post I remembered a certain discussion in science class today....


It started with Mrs. Carmichael (the dopest teacher) talking about gays and lesbians and if it's normal and if they have a choice. When jake mess tells us they have a choice i begin to shout out ""WHY WOULD ANY GUY DO THAT TO THEM SELVES?!?!"" (i'm not kidding!) this where the good stuff begins.....

julia eddy: well, i belong to the gay straight alliance i think it's awful kids are picked on that have no choice to be gay....the only kids who have a choice are the ones that are bi. i mean, atleast those kids don't care cause they are having fun...

then jake mess came up in the clutch

jake: Mrs. Carmichael....do you think guys will ever have a mutation were they can reproduce with other guys?
me: WHAT THE HELL KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT!?
mrs. carmichael: that's an awfully big mutation
me: that's freaking sick!


this brings me to my next point....don't do crack!

I was supposed to be goin to the olive garden with a group of cool kids when it fell through and left me with absolutely nada, zilch, shit, nothing. i thought i was gunna be bored all night..but serena called me and she ended up coming over to play poker haha and then we watched the Notebook.&lt;wtf. lol it was ight i guess, i heard it was one of those ""heart-wrenching"" movies that makes you all emotional n stuff...i dunno maybe im heartless cuz i didnt shed a tear. serena on the other hand... haha, anyways i actually heard her utter the words ""i dont wanna play poker"" so to all the knights who agreed that it was getting unhealthy for her to be such an addict...i think shes getting better. Anyways, this morning i woke up for work which was extremely boring today. Afterwards tho i FINALLY went to see my sisters house. i was&nbsp;friggen excited cuz i was like the last one to see it. we shoveled the driveway for like an hour or so...very tiring and we eventually broke both shovels...my dad MIGHT be a lil pissed off cuz i broke his brand new one and hes frugal with his cash like that. least on little things but he has no problem goin out to get an escalade..yea dad your cool. but all in all it was very nice just spending time with my sister for a change, other than work shes always with joe(future hubby)&nbsp;so lil brother (me)&nbsp;has been takin the back burner lately. But we all just had a fight so were all in like different rooms...family love at its best. whatever tho my dad started it. haha ok im done.</P>

so I guess since I last left you guys you missed out on my multiple cat storys (?), me and long's adventure, and JS?!?

let's start the show.....

So basically it's about 5 a.m. (or so i hear) and our front door is wide open! Now we live in the mother fucking hood so i don't know what beth is thinking. Alright so this cat gets into our house and I guess fights our cat. Now of course, we train our cat to fight, so it fucked that stray cat up.....whiskers all over the place!!!!!! (well, maybe one was found).....then of course, some dumbass decided to pet my skater shoe because it looked like a cat. Living the high life.....high on life you faggots!

me and long decided to become rebels for a day on thursday because my mom was gone. We took a ride to the mall.....very unrebelous except, WHO DROVE!?!?!?!?

and basically JS told me to get back into this so i was like ""hey, i'm getting back in""

I LOVE YOU SCOTTY!

yes yes yes welcome back stock and sull, I have been hearing people are missing the most real people on the face of the earth. During my time off I had time to think of a slogan I think fits well..."" once you go stock, you don't want another cock."" That'll explain to everyone why I steal your girl. Of course this is me pretending to be Dave chapelle (black and pimp)/ Stabone (makes up huge stories)
let's start the show...

Let's strat it off as I may have had one of the luckiest poker weekends in recent memory. Yes a second placer to the rich kid. (urban dictionary lists him as a pussy so HOW COULD I LOSE!?)

speaking of urban dictionary, the new fad site, brought back to life by A FRESHMAN!?!?!? yup even the rich kid was on a site that was made popular by a freshy.ahhhhhhhhhhh, true story. well i'll just give you an idea of some of the greatest kids SOPHMORES 07 have to offer....

quin nicholls:1. Quin 
A white anglo-saxon protistant who fears change and black people.

richard vonger:1. Rich Kid Syndrome 
When a child is born into a family of great riches, living in a fucking big estate. This child tends to act pompous and snotty. Boys with Rich Kid Syndrome tend to act feminine, and are given names such as 'sissy', 'nancy' and 'goodie-two-shoes'. They get about with their limo, escourted by their butler, Jeeves.
I don't know anyone with Rich Kid Syndrome, but if I did I'd knock and run at their house, planting fart-bombs.

aj abraham:1. stabone 
A gay male that believes he is better than everyone.
That guy thinks he's better than me, he's such a stabone

adam stockmeister:ADAM! 
An amazingly hott and sexy guy that i made out with! He wants my nuts! (And i'm a chick so that was totally in a matter of speaking terms)Dude! He is just totally hott and i would do him any day of the week!Like for real man! Yea!

^they even got me right!...simply amazing

they can't predict freshman right, way off!
5. jenna 
a girl about 5'2 that knows how to get down. she usually looks like a mouse but is really hot.
see that short girl, she's such a jenna. i'd bang her.


and with all that all i have to say is.....alright
IM OUT BITCHES
FUCK YO COUCHES
FUCK YO MAMAS
wait, i'll fuck yo mamas ;)

Good thing it was teh same girl doing all 3. Yes a young, high, banging female i wouldn't mind jamming asked us where the KLASSY KAT WAS!? As me and Matt began to explain where it was the other companions took off for wegmans. During this stretch of the walk me and long proceded to fight (round 4). Yours truely through him into ice (by accident) another win for adlerson. we reached wegmans with success as we all bought numb-numbs (a sophmore speacalty). Leaving wegmans resulted in us seeing the cops, making a quick get-a-way, only to see what looked as the beginnings of a street race. Only these fags waited like 3 minutes at a red light only to not race. fags......... finally we reached home to play another sophmore specalty......oreos

i mean poker



top 5 for the night......top 5 numb-numbs bought on adventures

1. stock and bobby's eclaires
2. matty moranimal's chef salad w/ 2 french dressings a la wegmans
3. scotty's semi-normal pack of gum

so here it goes:
let's start up post valentines day. i now have 3 groupies and what a surprise....their freshman! AHHHHHHHHHHH! Me and danielle santillo had to put up with an awful english class at one point this week but we make the best of it. were troopers...SUPER TROOPERS! English only reminds me how me, long and coop all refused to make a rulebook to a game thats not playable! Long made it too easy to win and there's absolutely no point. eh, ZEIT'S problem!

last night: RG n E dude comes rolling in, and i realize beth is upstairs by herself with some 20-something fuck head! little do i realize that judging a book by it's cover gets you nowhere. The guy was a gentleman at 60-70. excellent hahahah. so me and beth hang out for awhile until madre gets home. party all night turned to party til 830.....SWEET!

today: let's pick this up in 3rd period where an intense game of matball was happening. seniors, me, anthony burke, and the step team vs. all..............this is where rivalries start
are team played the roll of RH and got some heart after a 0-0 contest for 2 innings. we scored 6 to take a 6-0 lead. this resulted in a step team dance. good times. i guess kiki is my mom? dope.......?
DOPE!



top 5 today is the top 5 most underrated singers/groups (possibly songs if its a must download)

1. ozma
2. tenasious D

First off, let's review Valentines Day the holiday of love where two people who are just meant for each other are able to spend the day together in complete, utter bliss...ahh....o yea shit, def. forgot I WAS VALENTINELESS!!!! so in case you didn't really pick the hint off of that, Valentines Day was a let down. However, I was given sum nice cards by a few close friends of mine...thanks you guys. O YEA! morgan miller also proceeded to give me yet ANOTHER valentine...ahh that morgan...ummm shes great and evertying yet im gettin a little scared here...she literaly chased me down the hall yesterday. I have to say the best part of my day was later that night where Kyle invited me over to spend V-day with his fam and keely. good times, we watched Harold and Kumar go to White Castle. eh now heres the pathetic thing...if all of the above wasn't already pathetic enough....the ONLY thing i cuddled with ON valentines day was kyles effin cat. I mean i hope it was as great for the cat as it was for me...but come on now i bet even people like MRKD (mary rose K. Dempsey) had better love fests than that. haha o wait, they did for sure. Ike told me on the bus today that she sent like 6 flowers to that Kim girl or whatever...wut love? wut passion? only at RH. Im prolly goin to hell for makin fun of them soo i'll stop. Umm...right about now im just gettin ready to crack open my global hw and attempt to get all or most of it done so i dont have to worry about it tomorrow...i dunno we'll see how this goes. I guess thats it for me, i just wanted to express my feelings on valentines day...and if the message wasn't quite clear enough let me put it in simpler terms...NEXT YEAR I BETTER HAVE A EFFIN VALENTINE CUZ I AIN'T SNUGGLING WITH A CAT OR GETTIN SHOWED UP BY FRIGGEN LESBOS AGAIN! K thanks guys! hope your valentines day was SUPER!!!!!! much love.

Stockis new house is pretty sweet, his mom already had her scrap booking stuff set up..that lil scrapbooker! o yea in case that didnt make sense, his mom and my mom scrapbook together! I finally purchased Harold and Kumar and im about to proceed to watch it...with my mom, eh thats prolly nota good idea considering its based on two guys who smoke weed and get the munchies... also i got NBA street vol. 3....serena got crushed in that...so badly that she actually gave up. now heres where things get a little rocky, it seems were having a bit of a dilemma. our poker buddies arent really feelin up to another chapter all together for awhile...soo i dunno i hope we can get all this cleared up cuz frankly, I LOVE YOU GUYS and this is effin gay! &lt;homosexual statement? kinda but who the hell cares cuz POKER WOULDNT BE FUN WITHOUT EVERYONE THERE! anyways, tomorrow night i'll be stayin home alone all night cuz my family is goin to syracuse to see a game..yea they didn't get me a ticket...so if anyone wants to plan on callin me and keepin me company the whole night, that would be greatly appreciated. Today i got to work with Chris R. and i actually am gettin speedier on the register so im quite pleased. eh this is all i got sry it was&nbsp;boring update.</P>

"event","Let me tell you that all day the anticipation built for the lunch time championship. I started off in spanish with Willy lecturing us about how simoine and tay tay have no comitment to spanish and crap. It was definitly inspiring so i decided to do my global homework. Then some old lady popped into the class and I was like ""Wha!?"" and she smiled real nice. SWEET! So in advanced wood, longer and me spent the whole class basically chopping wood, cutting wood, smoothing wood, rubbing wood....jerking wood? i mean we are ahead in class! That takes us to study block where i pulled off the rare combo of chess and eating lunch and doing homework. Not many kids are blessed like me but, hey, what can i say. so i lost in chess, food on homework and didn't finish lunch...basically it sucked!

Danny Gabre and Chris Gibson vs. Adam ""stocki"" stockmeister and Matty ""mighty mattador"" moran
this game was the championship of grades

It started off with us (eagles) losing quickly 21-6. matt didnt like me going for 2 but what can i say. then the comeback started. a quick donavon touchdown run 21-14. after a matty interception it was donavon to t.o. put it on the board! another pick and it was another donavon run to put us up 28-21. the clincher...chris and danny are driving but sheldon brown picks off a pass for a touchdown!
WE WON!

Florida was pretty cool, not warm at all god damnit, but it was alright. we almost missed our plane to get back to rochester to...these airports these days they're soo gay. Anyways, Jacksonville was packed full of Eagles fans! pff in the middle of the streets were all these religous protesters tho, wow how effin&nbsp;weird&nbsp;are they? no offense to them but preaching about god to thousands of drunk football fans...wtf did they think they were gunna do?? This one lady had a huge sign that said ""you're running out of time, you're all going to hell!"" one of the fans just got in her face and started shouting E-A-G-L-E-S!!!!!!! i kinda felt bad but she asked for it...and i guess ""jesus told her it would be hard""....(friggen psychopath)...O yea, on the flight to fla. i guess there was this huge dance competition so the flight was full of beautiful girls...one actually looked like a young adriana lima...i wasn't nearly as slick as stocki tho so i didn't even get a chance to wink or anything to her like he did with the girl at wegmans! </P>

""WAKE UP SOLDIER!"" ""YOU FUCKING PUSSY!!!!!!!!!!""
""not.....now......beth.......""
we head over to the mall with my madre and i pick up a hoodie and polo shirt at clearance prices....DOPE!




next was matt simpsons where me and ben made plans for next weekend...blah...blah....blah.....RJ IS A DIRTY WHORE WHO CHEATS AND PLAYS BULLSHIT POKER!




the much hyped matty moran's exclusive....super bowl bash!
me and long arriving fansionably late to find a dissapointing ammount of bad jokes and crap entertainment....no playing poker, just watching it! dan and rich started the night awfully....as usual.
the football game then showed superiority....shawn green and me were stuck with retards who couldn't catch (anthony burke!) or throw (DOUG AND DANIEL....dan shows his weak upperbody strength later...)

so the game begins with some decent aray of numb-numbs known as pizza, wings, soda!, and chips with chesse! classic matthew classic....

around 2nd quarter was when me and doug decided amilyn needed to be hit up, crista was thrown in for good measure....doug and shawn made out...I HAVE THE PIC TO PROVE IT, ASK FOR IT IN SCHOOL! basically nothing happened and i was covering on my bet with aj....GO EAGLES!

halftime: we watch a bunch of old slow guys play a decent game of tackle football americano and some midgets get school by rick reed....it was a pitful display by everyone but matt who was gracious enough to shake hands with none other than anthony colosi! tim van voorhis put us on the edge of our seats with his fakes....sick!
halftime ended with long getting the crapped kicked out of him in the pile up cagging! splatted like a bug on fusion frenzy

after long realizeshis DBQ was wrecked he comes at me....WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS!?!?!?!?
long takes the cupcake from matts bithday cupcakes and slams it into my left eye!
that assination set off WW1 making me come at him and slam one back in his hair....after struggling, i began to dominate long as if he were a german and i was the allies....long basically was covered in chocolate frosting, ruined his holister shirt, and forced to clean it all up...he would get revenge

3rd quarter was spent cleaning up ourselves, me and long actually made up....for now

4th quarter was world war 2....and japan was definitly shawn green!........it began with dan and long starting to hit me and aj...aj and ricky champs starting taking dan and long until dan got up and came after me?! i just pick him up and threw him.....then me and long began battling in another brawl (ricky champion got great footage...) as are fight began finishing and i took the lead over long i ran into shawn....he kamakizied me by strangling me, i began to show my weakness (fear of suffication) that dirty twat.....i had to tap....shawn fought dirty....

the night ended with hand shakes and hugs...group clean ups and basically a ton of love! 5 dollars tomorrow baby!




this is stock wondering how the hell is there frosting in my ear!?!?"

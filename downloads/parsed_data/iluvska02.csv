"event","No more ring.
No more past present and future necklace.
No more pictures of us.
No more Scott and Lisa.
No more fighting.
No More anything. Its sad really. I am really hurt and torn but unnerving calm. I almost broke down this morning. I cried when I left his apartment yesterday morning. I cried though, because it was knowingly the last time i would see him for a really long time. I went and saw Maggie and she gave me THE tightest hug ever for Esa. It was great. Then I went home and tried to sleep, slept on and off for a bit, and then that was that. Had a few laughs. Talked about Scott and I to a friend, and then made plans for the week. Right now, I am trying to think of a new lj name and once I do I will be letting you all know it. This sucks ass. Anywho I am going to throw myself into a stupid project at work so that I am not breaking down for NO apparent reasons today."

Eating a sandwhich from White Hen that tastes even a little nasty will make your butt SOUND like its hungry and havent fed it in days.


Going to lunch with a co-worker WILL make people talk even more.

Wearing guazey like boy cut panties WILL ride up on you while wearing jeans."

"event","I woke up mind you after giving myself a better judgement to NOT watch Friends until tonite, but I went to bed after SITTING in the shower after working for 4 hours no break no potty break nothing. Just stood there for four hours and tried my best to learn what I could. I already found the shmapoo and conditoner that I want. Im sad. Its Rosemary Mint. GOTTA Love Aveda products that cost you your WHOLE check probably. The good news, is that Jennie, thinks I will get paid next week. Sweet. I didnt ask how often we get paid. I am assuming every week. Usually if its a biweekly thing people go for the 15th and 30th of the month. Everyone at Asha(it's an Aveda salon)seems really nice and helpful which is good. They offered me a full time position for $10.00 an hour, and I was like thanks but no thanks. One of the girls up front is suppose to be moving upstairs. So that leaves me and Chloe in front I believe so far. SO anywho. Spoke with Nikki last nite, and that was about it after I ate part of my white hen sandwhich which if I am correct the lunch meat was bad, so it wasnt ALL that great. I still ate it. We will see tonight if I get the shits. LOL...its true. SO ANYHOW. I went to bed at 11:30ish took me a few 20minutes to pass out, and when Scott called me when he got off of work, I was wired for sound or so I thought. I passed out again. My home phone has these issues that ummm well, it doesnt ring all the time, and it is PISSING me off. I might have to go buy a cheapy new phone. Anywho, point is, when I was awoken by the dogs at 5am this morning I noticed that my light on my phone was flashing which means I have a message. Lately I have been getting messages from SBC voicemail tips, and the message gets sent around 10am but I dont get the message until almost 10PM, so I thought it was that. Nope, it was Scott. Telling me that he forgot to tell me something when we had gotten off the phone and it was sweet dreams, and he loves me. And I saved the message. I LOVE when he leaves me sweet messages like that. LOVELOVELOVELOVELOVE it. I KNOW gag you, well go ahead and gag I LIKE IT! ANYWHO FIVE A.M. I WAS WIDE AWAKE, like oh I took a NAP NNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOO problem. Yea well thankfully Jennie at Asha asked me if I could work Sunday instead of tonight and come in on Saturday to do paperwork. I woke this morning and faxed some resumes hopefully MAYBE SOMEONE will call me back? Yes? COME ON FOLKS! Aggravating. GOOD thing was when I got dressed, I dunno if I had worn them already or what, but they smelled fresh, my jeans were looser. Im not stepping on that damn evil scale cause it will tell me differently then I feel and want to see. Ah well.
SO I go into the shop this morning like a bat outta hell on speed. And we have two shops connected. In order to get to the second shop you need to DUH...walk through the first one. So i do. One of the guys who I have been talking to who is probably the ONLY guy here my age, is in the shop. So is another guy. I say hey guys,as I am flying past and when I come back I dont say anything. Elg and I are talking a few moments ago, and hes like so ummmm whats up with you and Scott? I was like we're good, and I go into my happy couple, and he stops me shakes his head, and goes no THAT Scott, and points to Scott in the shop. I laugh and Im like N O T H I N G, I said Mike Im PRACTICALLY MARRIED. (I was asked several times last night if I were engaged) No, Scott is just a friend. He goes, OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Okay. Like ALL OF A SUDDEN IT MADE SENSE OOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH. I was perplexed so I proceeded to ask him what he meant by OOOOHHHHHHH. Elg says that many guys in the shop thought Scott and I HAD to be sleeping together cause NO girl as cute and pretty as I would want to JUST TALK to Scott, because he isnt that great looking. As explained to Nikki last nite, he has a unibrow. And it kinda really is distracting. ANYWHO, so I went and talked to Mike about it. He was like Elg probably said it to get under your skin...arent you like practically married. I laughed. It just bothers me that people think that. But I have no proof unless i have a camera crew follow  me around that the only thing Work Scott and I EVER do is talk on the phone. Okay. Mr. Rogers Killer is here. I must go you know...work. UNTIL THE NEXT TIME......."

"event","Maybe if I had some prozac I wouldnt want to breakdown crying and I wouldnt want to jump in from of a stopped bus. I dunno what it is lately but all the songs, that are suppose to make people happy and go gee I AM loved, make me happy, but like almost so happy I want to cry. 
I wish someone could put me to sleep for a day, remove my brain and the worry center, and solve ALL my problems, from what I am suppose to do with my life, to what SOCKS i should wear with what outfit. My heart hurts. 
I am sad. 
I am confused. 
I am annoyed. 
I am stressed. 
I want to scream so loud that because it felt good to do that, I can cry. I want to sobb deep heavy sobbs, and not feel depressed but feel like that is what I needed all along. 
I am unhappy about my weight despite my better smaller portion eating habits. 
I miss my friends. 
I want to go to a bar and be REALLY loud and singing and get incredibly shit faced, and have someone drive me home. 
I want someone else besides my boyfriend and the old guys I work with find me attractive. 
I need a different job. 
I need to have a breakdown.
I want someone to just KNOW what is wrong, and hug me and go I know sweetie.
I want to be 4 again, when my parents still loved another, and I was my Dad's favorite, and my BIGGEST concern was what fake food dinner I was going to make.
I want my money problems solved.
I want to stop shaking.
I want to kick Jenny that i work with in the head and go you are a MEANMEANMEAN Bitch AND Mr. Rogers DID kill himself because of you (see previous entry).
I want it to be summer.
I need to take back a Sunday morning about two weeks ago.
I need a vacation ironically enough...with my mother.(and NOT because she would pay for it)
I want this depressing phase in my life to be over.
I NEED just for ONCE in my life, people being able to accept that me saying I dont know what is wrong, means JUST that. I dont know what is wrong, something is wrong, something is bothering me...let me figure it out for me self. (YES, ME self).
I need to be able to afford an apartment on my own.
Scott used to watch me sleep for a minute and he must have felt compelled to kiss me, cause he would just kiss me gently. I do the same for him...only he doesnt wake up.
I want a phone call in the middle of the day that just takes me back.
For one day the only thing I want to worry about is what I am going to buy next and NOT feel INCREDIBLY bad for wanting something.
I want to be able to say No and be okay with it.
I must REALLY be going insane because I want to see Scotts family. All of them. Probably because they make me feel more sane.
I want my Aunt to move back out to Streamwood, and go to her house tonight after work, and she would wake up and sit with me and we would talk, and if I wanted to cry she would just hug me.

Im done. I suppose I just have a lot on my chest right now. Im trying to let things happen one day at a time and I cant. The only thing I got really excited about was Emily and I talking about taking a trip to the Dells. I start my second job tonight at Aveda. It should be fun. It will be extra money and if I have figured out right I will be okay rent and bills wise. I plan on paying off both my credit cards so all will be well soon. I dunno. I dunno. I dunno. I feel like a mental patient walking around in my hospital gown and pick at imginary bugs on my arms, and talk outloud to myself. This is sad."

"event","I just want to first off say I know VERY little bands so bare with me, and TWO, I have the HUGEST taste for chicken soup with saltine crackers!!!  And if you doubt the band names I have listed are real you can check my references on www.lyrics.com

hair color: dirty blonde with lighter blonde highlights
skin color: pasty white, i blind people when i go into the sun
eye color: aka hazel
piercings: had four in one ear, six in another, but now i only have two...im guessing it was a phase when I worked at the Icing
tattoos: TWO!!!

3) r i g h t n o w
what color pants are you wearing?: who said Im wearing any? We are a very casual office...kidding black dress pants
what song are you listening to?: I am mentally singing So Yesterday by Hilary Duff
what taste is in your mouth?: Diet Coke after taste
how are you? different. Im kinda duck like right now, I am calm on the surface, but paddling like mad underneath

4) d o y o u

have a bad habit?: which one? I crack my body parts A LOT
get along with your parents?: its back and forth but my mom and i are A LOT closer then we used to be.

ran away from home: thats a negative thats  how people end up not missing you when you come back
snuck out of the house: not like all window style but just quietly left after my rents were asleep, they knew the next morning though
ever gone skinny dipping: im trying to think if i have...im going with no but it is NEVER to late to catch some bacteria from a lake or pool
made a prank phone call: yea, a few times. Sometimes its amusing 
skipped school before: is it consider skipping if I had my Dad call in CLAIMING I was sick?
been in a school play: a few in JR. High, well a musical really

7) l o v e

had sex?: i've been known to have that a lot
children: do i look like i have a social death wish? Its bad enough i dont go out now let alone if I were to have a kid but i DO love children that go home in a few days or at the end of the night
current crush: what about it? Do I love my crush? Sure I guess
been in love: not IN love. Its a long complicated explanation but I believe that its not IN love, lets just put it that way.

your greatest regret: as Frankie would say, 'Regrets...Ive had a few, but then again too few to mention'

8) r a n d o m
your cd player has in it right now: in my car CD, Martina McBride, at home nothing in either of my players
what makes you happy: having a stupid day with Scott, where we just laugh and tickle, and play, and just be kid like no worries, being with Maggie. Having long deep conversations when I actually get to say how I feel and the person on the other end just KNOWS what i am saying and well, listens

9) w h e n / w h a t w a s t h e l a s t
time you cried:almost this morning in the car, I have my period and i listened to something that made me happy, and I got choked up
you got e-mail: uscellular job center search
thing you purchased: a bottle of water and pop, and a sandwhich for lunch from the Hen

10) y o u r t h o u g h t s o n
abortion: hey you gotta do what you gotta do. but you also have to remember this isnt like giving up a dog where in a few weeks you will forget about it, It probably stays with you F O R E V E R
teenage smoking: get a clue its NOT cool, it never was and it never will be. But if Im walking into White Hen if you give me a 20 for 10 I will buy you smokes
spice girls:  ummm well if I could have whats her names husband Beckham I wouldnt mind.
dreams: i think they are an insight to your everyday life. Im serious, if before you are about to drift off into sleep you repeat numerous times over and over about something that is bothering you, lets just use a cheating mate for an example. You repeat something along those lines, and see if you have a dream about it. The dream will and can be your insight to whether thats true or not."

"event","So I was thinking, (a dangerous past time i know...just wanted to throw some Beauty and the Beast in there). ANYWHO. I KNOW why Jenny is such a wretched bitch most of the time. A LONG LONG LONG time ago...stressing the long time ago part, when Jenny was a child. Once in a while she would misbehave. But since she misbehaved only every so often her care-givers wanted to make her punishment SO bad that she would NEVER misbehave, so they told her if she kept misbehaving like this that Mr. Rogers would kill himself. THIS of COURSE before his untimly death. She heard that so often that she was afraid it might happen. But Jenny just couldnt help but being bad. SO one day her care givers told Jenny that because she was so bad that Mr. Rogers killed himself BECAUSE of Jenny. She went APE SHIT. So many, many, many, centuries later despite that Jenny is only 50 I come along. And here I am, young, fresh 'meat' to pick on and torture. HOWEVER, she ONLY tortures me because I remind her of her childhood which reminds her of how she killed Mr. Rogers which in turn makes her be a bitch! End of story. NOW GO TAKE A NAP before someone from the OC kills themselfs because you didnt nap."

Boys II Men


We don't even talk anymore
And we don't even know what we argue about
Don't even say I love you no more
'Cause sayin' how I feel is no longer allowed
Some people will work things out
And some just don't know how II change

CHORUS:
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it baby

Now they can see the tears in our eyes
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well maybe that's a pain we can't hide
'Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart
Why do we hurt each other
Why do we push love away

"event","Lets see. Tuesday I went to see my diabetic doctor because at the time my blood sugar had been low for a few days by then. SO then I went to the doctor and came home. No problem. Wednesday I wake up with literally THE WORST CRAMPS EVER EVER EVER. I go to work despite feeling like I was going to vomit. I am work for about an hour and I cant handle it. I feel like I am going to vomit, AND my blood is STILL low. I talk to Mike and he drives me home, while someone follows him. We pull out of the work parking lot and are passing the Addison Ice Rink (it is LITERALLY the next parking lot perpendicular to our lot)and I tell Mike he needs to pull over...I vomit. Im embarassed. We make it home, mind you in one piece. Ive only let Scott drive my car, but Mike was VERY careful about driving my car. So then I talk to my doctor pass out. Scott comes over later and we talk about me and school, us, him and school, and it was a heavy talk but it got a lot out. THEN I am up literally alllllllllllllll night. At about 3am, my dogs go SPASTIC and just start barking and it is nuts. It scared the crap outta me. SO my blood being low now for five days I stay home again. I FINALLY get my period and I am STILL cramping btw. I call in, Mike calls me at 4 and leaves me a voice mail cause i slept through it. I call back as I was asked to and my heart was pounding that I was going to be fired, but Mike asks me kinda sheepishly to bring a note in tomorrow. I call and get one from my doctor. My doctor saw me off the record on Tuesday me not having any proof of ins. and having no money. Okay fine. I end up talking to the Scott I work with and I explained the story to him, and he was like you KNOW that is JENNYS doing dont you? That was my idea from the get go. I knew Mike knows I am sick but SHE is just such a bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep. and add some more bleeps in there. This just proves what a snatch this Jenny person is. I DO understand that most companies ask for a note when you miss work like this, but when I was in the hospital they NEVER asked for a note. What a crock of shit this is. Im just angered at her. THIS is the other reason why I would leave this job before I am asked to leave. When I talked to the other Scott, he told me to try and ignore her as much as possible because she is like this, and there is nothing I can do about her. What a wench. Tomorrow I am for sure returning to work. I have an interview for a part time job at Aveda. Sweet cash for part time work. THEN Jenny and I are hanging out. She is going home on Saturday. I dunno. I am kinda really stressed out so right now I need a good dose of Friends. The television show...."

Ten minutes each time is more then I usually do, AND something is better then nothing. Props to me ALSO for not eating any candy yesterday. At least I dont recall eating any. I was VERY tempted at 7-11 to get some but then couldnt part with the money nor take the time to figure out what it was that I wanted. AS for now...I need to go eat breakfast. I think I may not be eating enough because I keep getting VERY hungry inbetween meals. Ahhhh well. Thats life. Okay EVERYONE have a WONDERFUL DAY!!!"

"event","Last nite I went to Cyndis. Her and Ben have broken up and was in need of one of her best friends and I was bored and I wanted to be there for her like she was when Scott and I werent together. Greatness. The roads were pretty bad, not slippery but slushy and well snowy. Got home about 11:30 and fooled around on the internet. Because I had taken a deep long nap eariler, I was kinda awake but tired. I was afraid I wouldnt be able to sleep. I finally slumbered but awoke alllllll sorts of wanting to go back to bed. Made myself a crappy lunch. Not in the junk food sense just in the sense I didnt make myself a lot to eat. I talked with Emily this morning and wished I had more time to chat with her but I didnt. Then I got to work and my desk was in shambles. My in-box was stuffed more then a thanksgiving turkey and there was this HUGE ass box of mail. IN TWO WEEKS NO ONE DID ANYTHING with the mail, but PUT IT IN THE BOX! How annoying. SO now i am sitting here going I miss my Pumpkin, I miss Scott, I miss my friends, I miss School. Yes, folks I said it...school. Lately I have been thinking HOW I could work two jobs, AND go to school. I dont know how to. I dont want to. I cant ask my mom to do it, cause she wont. and my dad doesnt have the money that leaves.... me. I thought about going to Cosmotology school. It seems like fun, but then again I am not really about making 5.00 an hour plus tips. I'll pass thanks. I know its stupid to think like that but its true. I dont know what to do now. Im thinking about getting back into the medical field. But I just dont know WHAT I want to do in the medical field. My dream has ALWAYS been to work at Luthern General. I just have to start applying at hospitals. I dont WANT to quit the job I have now, but I also am paying $40.00 a WEEK for my health ins. PLUS whatever my co-pay is (I have been paying outta pocket because BCBS FUCKED UP with MY ins.). Ive been looking but not with all my heart because I sit here and go I have kinda a sweet deal here. I get two weeks off (unpaid which bites) in Dec., one week off in July and they are pretty uncaring in the sense if I miss a day here and there they are like well we are glad you are feeling better. BUT THEN there is Jenny. Jenny who is the cause of my late ins. entry. Jenny who buggs the FUCK outta me when I do something wrong. I just dont know. I am between a rock and a hard spot. BIG TIME. Taking a new job means, getting YET AGAIN, new ins., making new friends, learning new tasks, and starting allllllllll over again. I might just look at the herald.com, and see what kind of health jobs they are looking for. BLAH. This bites! If someone knows all the answers, I could use a handful."

"event","Where to start? Tuesday night I went to Scotts. He and I went to Jewel until 2am. I didnt go to bed until 2:30 because Scott didnt feel good and I was unpacking the groceries. Went to bed and woke up. We spent all day laying around being lazy just hanging out. It was fun. We played Monopoly and I landed on a property that I was REFUSING to give up more of my properties, so I go I lost. I REFUSED to give up my properties. I went to get ready, he laid there and watched Cops. SHOCKED?!?!?!? I was done getting ready and he went to get ready while I tried to calm my sister down, and iron his shirt at the same time. After it was all said and done he looked handsome. Just a simple Old Navy shirt and jeans but he looked good. We went to Macaroni Grill. We waited despite the fact we had called ahead. It wasnt a long wait maybe, 10 minutes. We got sat RIGHT by the door. Our server was late, and it took her forever to bring out drinks, AND to no fault of her own the mozt. sticks had some green salrento shit on it. So they finally moved us, and then they brought us mozt. sticks minus the green slime, and then Brian told the woman that he didnt like the sticks (they were more like three bricks)and she was like ahhh that sucks Im sorry. WAS IT REMOVED FROM THE BILL DESPITE THE FACT OF NOT EATING THEM.....NO! Scott for the FIRST time ever tipped horribly. We were about to pay when Heidi and Brian put down a gift card! I requested that if Maggianos was booked that Heidi call Cheesecake Factory. But she totally disregarded that, and booked the Grill here. Okay fine. It wouldnt have beena  big deal but it was rude. It woulda been ONE thing to be like hey we have a gift card you mind going here? No they negelected to tell us that. I was miffed. I thought I was just seeing things, but Scott nicely pointed out that that was true. SO. We get back to the apartment. Wait for Heidi and Brian to get there, so they arrive and we are all hanging out. I had about 3/4 of a glass of some malted chamange or something and Scott had two plain glasses. There were two bottles of the plain stuff, and two bottles of the malted stuff. Now, minus our three (combined together)glasses together between Scott and I, they finished THOSE TWO BOTTLES A PIECE! OMGosh. They were both tipsy when they left. Mind you we were drinking out of those beer glasses NOT MUGS, that they give you at a bar. But they were shorter. They dont even hold a whole can of pop. NOW you can see how much they are drinking. So we go to bed and wake up and go to IHOP after I am conversing to Emily via IMs. IHOP sucked. We came back and napped. We woke up and started straightening up the apartment, because it was in mayhem from the other nights. Fine. Then he goes to get on the phone with his brother and...I open my mouth. I opened my mouth because I am the youngest and sometimes I feel I need to stick up for Stevie, and I want him to feel like someone believes in him. I want to be that person. I dont need Stevie to like me, he will if he does. I dont need to convince him to like me. But me opening my mouth started an argument between Scott and I. That was over and done with, and I won a game of Monopoly. WHOOO HOO ME! Lane and Adriane came over and they cooked. And Scott got tipsy. Then he got dizzy. Then he got sick to his tummy. We woke and lets just say things lead to another and I walked out the door. Friday. I spent the late afternoon with my sisters, niece, step brothers, and step sister, Dad and Step Mom. We had a lot of fun swimming and hanging out, and just being a family. I missed it. I missed kissing my Dad good night. I may be 21 years old but I still love my dad. A lot. YES FOLKS. DESPITE the fact what has gone on between us I love him. Scott and I kinda talked for a few that nite but we agreed to disagree. I am going to try and do my best to shut up and not give attitude about his brother. I dunno about this. I am really going to try, but I just have to wait for a situation to present itself again. Anywho. So Maggers didnt sleep very well, which means I had about four hours of sleep. And so I came home and went to bed. Thats about it so far. I am just sitting relaxing. Hoping i will get my room in order, and then I am going to do something. I am going back to low carbing it. I have to. I didnt carecarecare for it but my blood sugar is telling me no different. I have to wait to start working out again though. I hurt my feet at the pool, walking on some kind of plastic mat thing and my feel are KILLING ME! Throbbing if you will. Okay so other good news. S.W.A.T, American Wedding, and Uptown Girls are all on video or are coming to DVD!!!! SWEET! The first two I know for a fact are GREAT movies. But I think I iwll like Uptown Girls. Anywho I am off now."

"event","WHAT a turn around from what I was feeling from last nite. TODAY however I feel like a fluffy BEAST. I want to ROAR like a Beast so it fits. First off I wake up and my mother is MASSIVELY CLEANING the kitchen. Just RAMPAGING! Finally, I worked up the courage, and went to get something to eat. Okay good. THEN I talked to Scott got my tushie dressed. Went to Aveda to apply for a part time job, went to get my oil changed, stopped in US Cellular and the guy who was in there was just TOTALLY short and creepy. I was WAY weirded out. (I just saw a tampon commerical that was a little odd, but the boyfriend in the commerical didnt seem AT ALL weirded out that his girlfriend pulled out a BOX of tampons and put it in the hole in the boat...MY boyfriend would be like WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?)Anywho. Got home and I was talking on the phone and I locked my door, my mom asked me to help with something with the runners. BUT THEN SHE STARTS vacuuming! So i go back in my room. Fine. I come out like an hour later after being on the phone, and she is done doing the runners. I say i THOUGHT you were going to come get me and she cops an attitude with me. WHATEVER WOMAN! Then she knocks on my door and leaves. I get UP and go after her because she wants me to go to the store for her. Meanwhile I had asked Cyndi if she wanted to go to Taco Bell for dinner. She doesnt get off of work until 7. Fine. She then told me that Ben wanted her to come out there tonight even though she is seeing him tomorrow. Okay. So she tells me she will call me back and let me know. I call her at 3 no answer. I call her again at 5 no answer, FINALLY at FUCKING SIX P.M. She answers and tells me that Ben guilit tripped her into coming over there tonight because BASICALLY he wants to get some. IF IF IF IF IF IF IF IF IF IF the rolls were reversed and she wanted me to go out there for dinner, and I said well I dunno I kinda sorta not really have plans with Scott, I WOULD NEVER HEAR THE FUCKING END OF IT! She would tell me to fuck him no its HER turn. BUT HOW DOES THIS MAKE SENSE?!?!?!? I guess I feel really shafted right now. I feel very lost and am finding very little comfort in the old things in my life and wonderful new comfort in the new things. I am becoming MUCHO aggravated with my old friendships, and MUCHO aggravated with Family members who are COMPLETE BITCHES to me, and I am super nerved by the friends who dont have to work for anything in their lives. You know what? Fuck it. Fuck it ALL. YES, I CHOOSE, to drop out of school, and I CHOOSE to eat that cookie, and I CHOOSE to do a lot of things in my life that made things more diffucult for me, but you know what, I dont need to hear about HOW FUCKING ""fat' EVERYONE IS, TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND WHEN YOU HEAR THAT VOICE THAT SAYS YOU DOOOOOOOOOO look good today...STOP THERE! WHEN You are bitching that you have NO money, come to MY world where there is no one to help you, and you have a car payment and diabetic supplies that you are paying outta pocket for, and you cant go visit your friends away at school because the bank who is lending you the money for your car DOES NOT care if you missed a good friends birthday. Im not asking for pitty. Im asking for ONCE in a VERYVERYVERYVERY long time, get OFF your drama horses and look around people. Your life does not suck, you do not have it as bad as you think you do. And when that friend who you think is okay to IM but EVERY single time talk about how HORRIBLE your life is and when you ask how hers is and shes says its okay...pry a little bit, cause MAYBE THEN you wont have to read it while she bitches on her live journal!"

"event","SO. Christmas I gots lots of things i needed for my apartment (you know the one I dont have). I also got new sheets and some DVDs. The ever popular money gift. Friday Scott and I spent the day with Maggers. Guys he was just SO great with Maggs. And she was SO in love with him. She passed out in his bed. She was just too cute. He was so good with her. It made us both realize that kids and now are NOT a good idea AT ALL. So note to self keep birth control in tact. We came home and I showered and then we watched Bad Boys 2 and that was that. We went to the doctor for him on Saturday and then I eventually went to the movies with Jenny. We saw Mona Lisa Smile. It was good, but there seemed to be no plot. Like it was just stating facts of how the 50s were. I was like eh okay. Good but a definate rent me.Jenn and I went to Applebees and had a drink. Sunday I woke up and did some shopping with my Ma. We went to Kohls where my ma used part of her gift card to get me a pink Adidas bag. It is too cool. Gabbed with Heidi and bit, made plans with Emily, and all was well...until TWO THIRTY A.M. where it became a sweltering NINTY MILLIONS DEGREES in my room WITH the fan on, and then came the cramps, and then it happened I got a caseof the squirts. So at 2:30 I was in the bathroom with my phone playing bowling. Felt better and had a hard time falling back asleep. Woke up and showered, and got myself all gussied up to meet Emily. Got to Woodfield, and every idiot was out. Emily and I had the most wonderful time. It was a little ackward at first like okay what do we talk about but then it lossened up and we had fun. We had lunch at Ruby Tuesdays and neither of us ate as much as we normally said we would, but it was all good. Im glad I finally met her. We agree, that we are going to try and do lunch once a month or so. I think it will be swell. I like her...I think I might replace Scott...KIDDING."

I am about to paint my toe nails a nice red color. I was thinking MAYBE doing my nails too but then someone will OF COURSE come online and then I will mess up my nails, THEN when they start to chip I have to take them off which will OF COURSE be in the middle of me having NO time. One more thing. The other day I was a goon and left my lights on...my battery dies. Fine. Mike charges it. Michelle and I go to go to Gurnee Mills and I go to put in a CD, and it wont let me. I was thinking i had a CD in there already. Then all of a sudden its flashing CODE. APPARENTLY my car has an anti theft device on it. APPARENTLY I was NOT left with the security code. I called the dealer and said I shouldnt have to pay to find the code out for it. If I have to take it to the dealer...ready for this?!?!?!? TO remove my radio, LOOK at the serial number on the back of the radio, and ENTER it in the computer...FORTY FIVE FRIGGIN' DOLLARS. I was pissed. So I called the dealer I bought my car from, and I said I refused to pay for it. Numerous CALLS LATER...GUESS WHO'S PAYING FOR IT????????????????????ME. I am PISSED. 

Anywho more important topics...I have recently become addicted to the show on MTV called Rich Girls. The one gurl Jamie IS SUCH A BITCH? Ever have a drama queen friend who EXPECTS you to put your life on hold for HER? THIS IS JAMIE. She is allllll pissed off at her friend because she wants to go to Greece, and wont be there to help her PACK for college. GET OVER IT. PACKING IS IT NOT FUN YOU BITCH. Uhhhhhhgggggggggggggggggg I DISLIKE HER STUCK UP SNOTTY BITCH ATTITUDE! Thats all.

Love you all. Merry Holidays! I update more later on what else I got from Santa."

"event","Let the suspense build shall it? Saturday I took Maggie to see Cyndi at work where she has loads of fun on the slide and she walked with us to Starbucks. Then we drove home and she ate lunch and was being a little snot. Then it was time to watch The Princess, aka Sleeping Beauty. I made some of my Double Cheese Popcorn and she indulged quite a few handfuls...like more then HALF the bag. Then she later ate some raisins. What a cutie. Went to Scotts, and well we attacked another. I was greeted with the door open, and a flower in hand. I went and changed into my xmas present for Scott. Then we had good long awaited sex. THEN I got my xmas presents. My first present was a Holiday Winnie the Pooh and Tigger. They are Blue and White. Very Cute. Toby the Cow is jealous and I literally feel BAD if i cant sleep with all my stuffed animals hugging them. WHAT A GOON I AM. Then I got an out fit from Express which I actually like. Scott said its something I can wear when we go out. Or I can wear it to work too. It is a pink cashmere sweater and a grap semi pleated skirt. Very chic. The thing is that he told the girl I weigh about 115 pounds when I weigh 126, and he said that I had large breasts. The woman INSISTED that I was a size small in a top and a size SIX in the bottom. It would fit but maybe maybe ina  month. So it was good that he went smaller instead of bigger. THEN he got me stuff from Victoria Secret. THEN he goes into his room, and came back out. He hands me an alligator skinned box. It wasnt a REAL alligator but you get the hint. I removed the bow from this box and as I am opening it, Scott goes insnt it a great WALLET? I open the box and inside is the most beautiful necklace. Three studs. Its the past, presence, and future necklace. Its so pretty. Basic enough to wear everyday but dressy enough to dress up. I love it. And the perfect frosting to the necklace? A promise ring. He goes I believe this will match PERFECTLY. I love it. I love him. I would love him even if he gave me the ring back and made me a CD. but this was SO NOT what i expected and SO VERY welcomed. Then we went to Target and he bought me Diet Mountain Dew...which ranks JUST as well in the diamond dept. We went back to his place, and we talked about our tree and how is was crooked. We cleaned and then Heidi and Brian came over. Which we laughed because we had the samenecklace on. Then Bill and Briane got there. I like Briane we would get along real well. Suddenly I have become very these people will get married these people wont. Its horrible. I dont go right out and tell these people but I think it. I asked Scott if Bill and Briane will marry and he goes no i dont think so. So I was bummed cause I like Briane. Then we went bowling which upon I had high school flashbacks. There were these girls there who were literlly pep talking another at the line. OMGosh _______you TOTALLY rock at this game. We went home later and had good sex. Then we passed out. You would thunk I was up until FIVE a.m. I slept until nine thirtyish talked to my Aunt ate some frosted flakes, then scott and I laughed and laughed while i tried to wake him up. I do feel bad but I dont. I wish sometimes he had a little more energy too. Ahhh well. Sometimes its good to be mellow. I just am always on the go unless im sleeping. Even then I think i am running or kicking. LOL. Anywho. Came home. Left mylights on, and it was only AFTER I slept from 1 to 4 that i went to my car to get a jewel gift certificate and I realized my interior lights didnt come on and i freaked. Went to the other side and saw the lights were left on. I was mad at myself. There is a short in the wires or something that makes the interior lights from my side not go on, and then they will from the passenger side. Okay fine. Mike charged my battery and it seems to be working now. I need to get that short fixed. Sometimes the interior lights work, and i can get the warning buzzer to go off, if the fuse is working. Whateva. Maybe I should learn to not have them on if i dont NEED them on. AKA during the day. Anywho. So hopefully those will kick up. Michelle wants to give me money to go to Gurnee with her tomorrow. To go the Fossil store. I need to fax some things for my ins. ahhhh Christmas is wonderful isnt it? Shiny things all around...diamonds and lights. Nite all."

"event","Lets see. Today I am leaving work because i forgot to tell them I cancelled a doctors appointment. Oh well. I need to kinda destress. Tomorrow is our grab bag. Scott is sick, and Im cranky. Im cranky for quite a few reasons. One is because I wanted to see Scott this weekend but one who was well enough to go oout until 2am last night doesnt know if he will be well enough to see me this weekend. I will talk to him about this later. I dont want to start a war with him Im just simply irked about it. ANYWHO. Cranky factor number two. I take my lunch punch out and all is fine...UNTIL the phone starts ringing and Marshall is talking with Jenny who refuses to answer the phone, and Byron is in the shop and ignores my page for HIS call, and when Marshall has been getting a call, he keeps asking me to take messages ON MY LUNCH. I was TRYING to have a conversation with my Aunt when there appeared at our window a man who wanted to go in GREAT lengths about the check he was holding. I DONT GIVE TWO HOOPING FUNTS! Hour and a half left. If I play it right, I can get out by 3:15. Im cranky. Tomorrow means that I have 9 hours of work, and then two weeks off. I told Jenny told cause Im hard up for cash, I told her i could come in a few days if she calls the day before and asks, provided I am not out of town (this is what I told her so that i dont HAVE to go in if i dont really want to). I just need to breath. The Holiday blues are settling already. Jennys bf is coming in if it doesnt snow so she rescheduled plans with me. Im not all that upset about it because I would do the same thing. I have some errands to run. Thats where Im really going to do when I get off of work. I need to go to Kohls, Borders, and Discovery. I must go now"

"event","Im going to just kinda jump because I rarely feel like I update anymore. First off I took a good crap once I got home. That was good. Made my full stomach feel much better. I also wanted to comment on the McDonalds WHITE Chicken Nuggets...can someone please enlighten me as to WHAT they were BEFORE they were white? Does that mean that someone bites into each nugget and puts the non white one back? My next thing I want to comment on is that PREGNANT WOMEN NOW IS THE TIME TO ORDER CARPET! Thats what the Empire Carpet told me. Next my step Dad order new cable channels and SCREWED up all the channels I knew by heart. SO NOW I HAVE to spend my two week break learning new channels! Okay onto something with ummmm substance. On Friday I went to Walmart to pick up my stuff from layway. I PACKED my car. Saturday we were suppose to go to Cheeseburger Paradise. We thought the wait wouldnt be THAT long but it was TWO HOUR wait. Needless to say though my hunny tried and made the effort for us to go, it was too long to wait. So Heidi,Brian, Scott and I all went to Ruby Tuesdays. Sunday I woke Scott up kinda early. Then we laid in bed and tickled another, I talked to Emily while he showered. Eventually I went out to dinner with Jenn. Monday I get to work and Jenny told me she was there until eight on Friday because I messed something up. I was like f that. I did mess up but THAT is EXACTLY WHY I told her I HATE doing HER WORK! We fixed the problem all is well. OH, I talked to Mike sometime after my last entry about her firing me, and Mike said he said NOTHING about wanting to fire me, she is just and her shook his head. SO TODAY. Jenny asks me after I went to Jewel for for to put the gift cards into the apporiate places. Okay fine. That would be fine IF with that she didnt give me insurance papers to fill out. I was pissed. I walk back into her office and I am like those are THE EXACT papers I filled out before Thanksgiving. She goes well you turned them in late. I said I gave them to you at MOST three days later. She goes Lisa it was like TWO WEEKS! I was so angry with her. I was tearing up at my computer talking to Scott about it. What happened was because HER ass waited until December first. Her and I tiffed back and forth and I wanted to yell at her for WAITING! But then she was nice and she called Blue Cross Blue Shield and we got things rolling. Peggy our ins. agent said tomm. when i fax some things she needs to continue my stuff, that she was going to at least get my stuff into walgreens computer so they could get my money overnighted to me. I was very happy and pleased that such an effort is made. We are having a grab bag at work with a twenty five dollar limit and the woman i picked speaks very very very little english and her sheet had NOTHING written on it but her name. Im like gggrrreeeaaatttt. So I have to opt. for a Walmart gift card. In other news. Maggie's picture and mine is on page ten of the Franklin Park Herald Journal. Thats great. It says Lisa and Maggie Powell....ummm Scott hunny, I love YOU not my brother in law, and Maggie is not really mine. Im gonna go now. I need to take a shot, and I am kinda online because I am hoping that Emily signs on. I wanna chat with her but I dont want to call her cell cause shes spending QT with John. Maybe I will go make Cheese Popcorn. BY THE WAY, While on break if you get the chance to watch Room Raiders on MTV pretty amusing show. Its about three girls and a guy who goes into all their rooms, and sees judging by their room who they wanna go on a date with. At the end the girls get to go into his room and rummage through it. LOL. Im such a dork. TWO MORE WORK DAYS AND TWO WEEEEEEEEEEEEEKKKKKKKKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS OFF!!!"

"event","Yesterday I had a pretty crappy day. First it started off that I woke up at 5:30 but I accidently reset my alarm so that instead of it being 6:30 it was really 5:30. Once I noticed this dilemma I YET AGAIN reset my alarm clock for 6:30 after changing the clock back one hour. Long story short somewhere in all this clock switching I set my alarm wrong and didnt wake up until my ma asked me if I was going to work...at 7:30. She helped me out by warming my car up and making me four pieces (dont ask why so many) of toast and I was out the door. As I was gettin dressed (jeans and a nice shirt) I told myself I didnt care what JENNY had to say because Mike who is MY boss wears jeans EVERYDAY! So I get to work on time might I add. And then it starts. I can get online, I cant. I can, I cant. Then Jenny says something to me about my 'grub' wear. I was like I can go home and change. I said it kinda snotty but she is like no. THEN WHY DID YOU INSIST ON SAYING SOMETHING?!?!?!? So then Jenny and I are blabbing about something and I told her I didnt know if she knew but Byron wouldnt be in today. She asked if I answered the call or if Mike did. Mike is one of three Mikes here, but in this case she meant Mike the owner. I tell her Mike the owner did, and she gives me this shocked ass look. I go what? She goes usually it doesnt occur for him to tell other people. I said well I think Byron called his cell, so he came right out of the lunch room and told us as he was walking to his office. She goes wow. I said what? She goes well last week, when you didnt come in on Wednesday Mike failed to mention to us that you called in. We knew you were released from the hospital on Tuesday so we were all like this is unacceptable and Mike Marshall and I were talking that we were thinking about letting you go because you 'hadnt called in'. I was like but I did. She goes oh yea we figured this out once we mentioned to Mike that we were gonna have to let you go because of that, and he was like Oh No she called this morning I talked to her. I was SO livid. YOU DO NOT TELL SOMEONE we almost fired you becasue SOMEONE ELSE forgot to tell us you werent coming in. I was PISSED. It gets better. Last week, I signed over 75 holiday cards with the COMPANYs name IN them. I over hear JENNY (I dont care for her in case you havent guessed)telling Byron that everyone is going to sign them...and she starts listing names, EVERYONES name BUT MINE. So I get the gull up to ask her if I should sign the cards because I didnt want to ASSUME I was suppose to sign them, and she goes oh no you did enough by signing the COMPANYS names. OH GEEEEE FRUCKING THANKS. I was so hurt. Like they didnt care that I wasnt on the cards. And it happened again yesterday. A vendor brought in these really NICE travel coffee mugs which I only wanted to be ASKED if I wanted the extra but again, they went down the list of people who they could give it to and my name wasnt even mentioned. This sucks and it hurts. You know everyday Elg says to me thanks for coming to work, it helped a lot. Whether he is kidding or not, it means something and i KNOW he appreciates when I do P.O's for him and what not but it just KILLS her to be nice to me. We are having a grab bag at work which I really dont have the money for but I dont want to be left out of that too, and I just am PRAYING we dont get another. Ill get her some graph paper and pencils. UGGGGGG so far today she has not said anything to me probably because she is doing payroll. Ahhh well. What else? Scott. Love that boy. He was great yesterday...actually he has been great for a while now, but he was just very attentive to what I was saying. He even threw in a few fuck hers. As for now. I must go work. One week one day left of work until i have two weeks off. Thats not bad."

"event","Lets see. Jenny managed to NOT piss me off Thursday after returning to work for the first time in a week. Then she has me start signing company Xmas cards. SO I sign 75 plus Xmas cards with Micro Mold & Dimension Molding written all over them. I was complimented on my nice hand writing...great. So Friday comes, and I am SUPER swamped. Okay finally at the end of the day I start putting the labels on the cards and I am about to put the cards in the envelopes, and I go back to Jenny and say, 'Was I suppose to sign the cards?' I really wanted to. I am a part of the company so WHY wouldnt I? She goes oh no you dont because you signed all the cards with the company name on them. I was mad. I was hurt, and I felt like I was appreciated. It was unerving. Went to Cyndi's Friday night and we watched chick flicks and ate. Woke up Saturday, went home, and napped. Got my hair done, and came over to Scotts. He got a little cranky on the phone with me because it took so long to get my hair done, and I didnt call him. I really didnt want to go at that moment because we have gone so long (knock on wood) without arguing I didnt want to argue. I get to his apartment, after making some sorta plans with Heidi and Scott and I kiss like we havent seen another in months. Then we of course had sex. But this time it was intense, and so much love behind it. I know you guys dont want details but it was JUST out of a romance novel. The first pages of this romance novel would be start something like...his hands searched my whole body in passion. It just felt so right. After I felt shakey. I felt like my blood was really low. I checked my blood and I was 400. Yea, thats not low. So I shot up, and we left to go get his hairs cut, and to go see his Aunt and Uncle. After Heidi called me and Brian was being a bitch because he didnt want to wait until 9 to eat, we ended up eating with his Aunt and Uncle. I missed them so much. They are such TRULY great people. They dont treat you like you are 21 HOW could YOU know what life is? They are the best. Anywho. So we left there,and were suppose to meet Heidi up at the bowling alley because Brian was working a detail. Scott and I started talking and then we went to buy porn. After that we came home, and Scott showered, we had sex, and I thought for sure I was gonna pass out, but I didnt we watched Bringing Down the House. It was cute. Not totally funny but cute. As the movie was over, Scott turned off the TV and took my hand to lead me to the bedroom...but stopped in his living room...and danced with me. He NEVER dances with me. On the way home from buying porn, we were talking about how much we hearted another. He goes I heart you as many tires on as many school buses that go round. I went to retort (this is a game we play), and I said, I love you, I mean I heart, and he goes you KNOW i still love you I just dont think it was right to say during our break. We talked about how neither of us are seeing other people,and we are still together but this break is just needed for us. We talked about how long its been since we have argued, and things just seemed to click. Scott tucked me in, and then curled up next to me and we laughed and laughed, where upon I told him one day i was still gonna marry him one day, and he said yea I guess (a way back joke), and then he asked when. I said I dunno one day. After talking to Emily on Friday she said that I was so impatient to get married (not her words, but the thoughts were the same) because I knew it was right,and I was sure. Men on the other hand think of it in a totally different way. I said that I wanted to be like my Dad and Carol (not the attitude) but how much they love another. They still kiss and hold hands and stuff, its great. And thats how Scott and I are I want to keep that. So we passed out and at some point during the night Scott CRACKED me on my head, and I just rolled over. Got up dressed and woke him up which this time i did NOT have to fight him to death to get him up! Ran some errands and thats was that. He was telling me something about his Dad, and I said to him, well if you have you Dad over just tell him that I am living with you. He goes maybe by then you will be living with me. So we touched base on that subject for a moment, and I smiled. And I felt love all over again for the first time in a long time. As for now I am going to get off this machine, and go lay on Scotts lap while he reads the paper, and wait for Heidi and Brian to call."

"event","Lets start somewhere where I think I should update because its been a long time. Monday around 2am I started vomiting and then I finally stopped around 9am, just to restart again at 1pm. Then at 4pm I made the decision that i should break in the new ins. and go to the hospital. I wasnt quite TOO bad with my diabetes but I was getting there so I made the adult decision and said I think I should go NOW before things get really bad. They admitted me the the hospital with what was probably sadly, the lowest blood sugar reading I have ever had going to the hospital for DKA (Its a diabetic thing thats hard to explain) and I came in at 434. Thats not to bad. Usually I am vomiting SO bad that I can barely stay awake, and stop long enough to tell them my name. This time I was fully awake, and very little chest pains. Scott came and sat with me for about an hour then went to have dinner with his Dad. At that point I hadnt gotten sick in quite a few hours and I thought I was pretty home free. Got up to my OWN room, and that when I wanted to vomit again. NOW USUALLY my body knows I mean business when I get to the hospital, it just stops doing whatever it was doing before. So it was odd. All this time later, and poof, I get sick one last time. The doll of a nurse was asking me while i was puking none the less which is kinda rude but made up for it when she was asking me what my height was, ' 5'2"" ', more puke, 'weight?', more puke, 126 as of this moring I finally got out, and she goes oh you look much tiny-er then that. (maybe its late or what not but putting tinier as the spelling looked wrong and I am too lazy to fuck with spell check)so that made me feel happy. Eventually talked to my Dad the next morning after the whole drama of BARELY sleeping all night with ummm basically every other hour blood drawings, vital readings, blah blah blah. LISTEN my BLOOD is THERE, my VITALS...yea, Im breathing they are there too, LET ME SLEEP I AM SICK! Eventually my cousin came to visit me before she started work, and then I fell back asleep. Many doctor visits,Scott eventually got there. I was allowed to eat, I mean INHALE breakfast. And that was that. I got note of dischargement, and I wanted my stupid IV OUT! It was killing me so bad. Michelle came and got me, Scott left, and this student doctor came in. She was VERY timid. I was aggravated with her because she just seemed out of it. NOT dumb. Just like asking me the same question but in a different format. Then she had to do some basic tests on me that your normal doctor would usually perform but that they are learning to do, and my left arm is just throbbing in pain from the IV they still have in but wont take out, and she wants me to squeeze her fingers as hard as I can. So i am squeezing the beegeebers outta her right hand but barely touching the left and she is telling me after repeated times me telling her I can NOT do it with my left arm. She keeps insisting basically I am being a baby and that I can do it. I give up on her NOT listening to me and I take my left hand away. She asks me again to squeeze and I tell her for the last frucking time I CAN NOT DO IT WITH MY LEFT HAND MY IV HURTS TOOOOOOOOOO MUCH! She got the hint after I got snooty with her. I didnt want to but LISTEN TO ME DAMN IT! Eventually went home with my sister annoying me the whole way home. I was just kinda like dude ENOUGH. She dropped me off and I came in and ate. And then I passed out on the couch. And then I ate some more. Then I felt sick. So I stopped. Then I ate a half a sandwhich type deal around 10. Decided not to go to work that I needed just to rest. Slept kinda crudy. Then woke up called work, went back to bed for a bit, did some odds and ends things, and here I am now. UP. Maybe since I got some things off my chest. I had to make a terrible news delivery to everyone that I couldnt afford xmas presents. Everyones response was pretty much either I cant either so its cool, or thats okay I would rather see you get an apt. Is this peoples way of saying they are going to be houses guests? I need some serious cash flow big time. Im just mad about this whole work and closing down for two weeks, which rocks but uhhhhh NO pay. Uhhhh I got bills people. My Dad said something that was profound, which was the gas company, the landlord, the electric company does not care whos birthday it was or if it was xmas they want their money. Which is true. So sorry to everyone. But literally Maggie isnt even getting a gift. Unless SOME miracle happens...no gifts people. So today I head back to work, which will be tiring and fun and and and well Jenny better watch out because I WILL NOT TOLERATE HER berating me. Bitch. And on that note...I think im ready for bed."

"event","Im not into super detailed weekend, but it kinda went like this. Friday went to Scotts, he dressed up for me because he never dresses up for me, then we went to Chili's for a real dinner. I eventually went home. Passed out. Woke up at 7:30 on Saturday and I am just being PLAGUED with money issues that I have brought upon myself. I just dont know where a meets b and whatnot. Came home after my hyponosis apt. and TRIED to take a nap but then Mike starts vaccumming THE BASEMENT. WHO the FUCK vaccuums A NON FINISHED BASEMENT? Went to Scotts, because I wanted to nap, and I got there and did just that. Napped. Not for long but I did. We watched Hollywood Homicide which was a good funny movie. I like it alot. Made my xmas list is how good it was. Went home almost right after the movie because Scott didnt feel good. Went to Walmart and Dennys with Nikki. Emily didnt want to go, but it was okay. Came home actually early from our Denny's trip. We usually make it an all night thing but tonight was different. Nikki laughed at my Keith Urban song. Tried to sleep late today but couldnt. Went and picked Maggs up so she could see Grammie and Poppie. Talked to my dad about apartment things, and hopefully I can somehow afford to get a condo soon. This depends on whether or not my ma and mike will let me stay here another six months. Then I dropped maggs off at home, chatted for a bit with Rae and Tommy, and then I came home shopped with my ma, and then passed out. OH we bought Coca Chex Mix...IT IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDD! Then I woke up and ate dinner, showered and here I am now. As for now I am going to write my ma and mike a letter to say this is what is going to happen and this is how it is going to work. I am going to get some Coco Chex Mix i think. I dunno. Its a good writing tool."

"event","Think of a memory. A TRULY HAPPY memory. One that makes you feel so happy inside NOTHING will let you get down on it. Now, as you think of this memory take a deep breahte in and place you right hand over your heart. Press Gently. The thing about this mental excercise is that you can NOT think of anything else but this happy memory and the placing of your hand over your heart. The next time you start to feel like crap (meaning getting down on yourself) take a deep breath, place your hand over your heart and think of this happy memory, and smile or laugh or whatnot. You can not brezzzzzzzzeeeeeeee through the excercise you need to take a moment or two and relive the memory.

Here is why:

When you think negative thoughts. Whether it be I am a fatty,I will never graduate, I hate my life...you release a chemical in your brain, that goes into your bloodstream AS FAT, and then insulin is released and THEN it is stored...AS FAT. I know it seems hard to believe but its true. The more you think about it the more you will realize JUST how true it is. Ever notice that when you start thinking Yea I can lose this weight NO problem, then you slowly start to take it off? But when you are telling yourself that you are a fatty blah blah blah...you gain? Sad story but its true my friends.

Yes, for five a.m. I am in a chipper mood. Maybe because Scott and I are TRULY going to put up his Christmas tree and make cookies, or maybe its because I was being bitter for NO reason yesterday. Or maybe... Or maybe I just need to calm myself down and practice what I preach... 'Everything Happens for a REASON'.

Nikki, Emily, other Emily too, I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to see you all on a Denny's trip Saturday. Emily S. I know you have to get up for Church but we are REALLY funny on our Dennys trips. ESPECIALLY when trashy girls STARE at you because you are wearing a fishermans hat...the nerve of some chicks. 

Anyhow. Love you all. Today is a new day make the best of it."

There ain't a woman in the world that wants to hear the word yes
When she asks if you think that she looks chubby in that dress
And if she cooks all day you better eat it with a smile
It doesn't matter if it tastes just like bad gravy on a Goodyear tire

Yeah, yeah, yeah all right so you bend the truth
Yeah, yeah, yeah that's somethin' that you'll have to get use to

You bite the bullet and you clean your plate
And then you go on and on about how great it was
That's not a lie, that's love

Well it's the very same thing that she does for you
When she doesn't bring up the fifteen pounds that you need to lose
And every time she runs her fingers through your hair
And she says she kinda likes the way there's not as much of it there

Yeah, yeah, yeah well all right so she bends the truth
Yeah, yeah, yeah that's somethin' that you have to get use to

Went to dinner with Brian, and it went well. It was a long time since I laughed so hard. Dinner kinda sucked but ah well. Made plans with Brian to see Texas Chainsaw Massacure. Got home watched frineds, and passed out until ready for this...NINE a.m. GO ME! Got up eventually passed out after watching the rest of Chicago and Bruse Almighty. Got up somewhere between Scott calling me and my mom coming in my room telling me good bye and she hopes I feel better. Then I woke up. Tried out my new razor which might I comment works SOOOOOO NICELY! LOVE IT! Okay so moving on. Then I got upset. Not crying upset but I tried and put my hand on my heart and I breathed deeply and I wanted to cry. Last Thanksgiving I spent it in the hospital, and this thanksgiving I am sick again, but spending it alone. I am upset. I am upset for numerous reasons. I am upset that my life hasnt turned out the way I planned. Three months ago I was planning on moving in with the most wonderful person who I NEVER doubted and NEVER had a problem trusting, and now i am at home sitting here, wondering it is how i am going to afford moving out by myself. I am suppose to be sitting on a couch in OUR apartment watching TV waiting for Scott to wake up, and then when he does wake up, he comes over the couch frezzing,and lays on my hip until I tickle him to get up and moving. And I am suppose to be spending my First Thanksgiving with my 'new' family. But Im not. And I am hurt. Im not mad at Scott, Im just mad that I made all these plans and I am yet again disappointed in my life. Nice huh? I want this all to pass. I need more strength. I need to be loved like I deserve to be loved. I need to be...happy(ier)s"

Kinda cocky and I was like nothing I just wanted to see if you needed any help with...THAT. I couldnt think of what else I really wanted to do for her. Then, she goes no i dont but you NEED to stay busy Lisa. I have PLENTY of things for you to do but you need to stay busy. I said I was just coming off my lunch THAT is why Im back here. Its like EVERY time I try to explain why I did something SHE is there interupting me telling me WHY IM WRONG. IM NOT WRONG IF YOU WOULD LISTEN TO MY REASONING ON WHY I DID IT! She scolded me one day for doing invoices too late, then I did them TOO early. MAKE YOUR FUCKING ANAL ASSED MIND UP! I am so aggravated with her right now. Everyone feels this way about her, but its like everyone walks around and ignores it. IM NOT GOING TO. DO NOT BE A BITCH TO ME...cause my mother is QUEEN BITCH and Im the princess!"

So what else is new...Jenny pissed me off ALREADY this morning and she hasnt even been here for an hour. Last night before we all left we kinda all got into a bitching match about Jenny. It felt good that I wasnt the only one who felt this way about her. This morning she managed to piss me off because I had her check the invoices like she always does, and then she goes REALLY next time you are going to want to wait until I get here. WHAT THE FUCK WOMAN?!?!? FIRST it was I waited TOO late, then I did it too soon. NO. I guess I need to talk to Mike about this but its like I dont want to be oh I cant handle anything. SO yesterday I called Gadzooks, and left a message because the one manager was too busy to talk. No one has called me back. Ahhhh well, ummm find another job. Later on after dinner I went to get gas and deposit my check, which was cool. Got a power car wash that made me take it up the ass because it was 7.00. I USUALLY only pay 5.00 at the shell across the street. I decided though it was more expensive for the car wash, the gas is the same price so whats the diff. Then I went to Target. Looked around, and then I thought I would buy Ms. Spears new CD since I liked all her other ones, Im not done listening to the whole thing, but lets just say Im glad I only paid 9.99 for it...its not worth MUCH more then that. LOTS of dancin' clubbin' songs. Nothing really to sing to. I have a feeling this will be her last album. Ahhh well Brittney its been a pleasure. I did however save the booklet inside the CD cover because well, she looks HOT. Did you know that those indivdual packages of lunchmeat have 12 GRAMS of PROTEIN! I was way stoked. I looked in the mirror today and LIKED what I saw. I dont know if I have IN fact lost any weight, but I feel MUCH better and MUCH thinner about myself. Funny how those things change in just ONE day. Chowing down on some nuts now, getting my keyboard all greasy. Its cool though. ANYHOW. I am gonna go look at stuff on the internet. Everyone have a most splendid weekend."

He rolls his eyes and points towards Jenny's office and goes NO she wants to do it. Fine no skin off my back. I STILL offer today (even AFTER her scolding me for waiting SO long to do invoices, I waited until 8:30 I was doing OTHER work)to go get the food. She says no thats okay. Ah Well.

Yea, didnt think so <Give Jenny TWO MIDDLE fingers> Im SUCH a rebel!
I have a class last night where I set goals up for myself. I learned that saying NO you DONT want that hershey kiss, I should be saying things like A hershey kiss sounds good but an apple with peanut butter sounds EVEN better. That way the last thing your mind remembers is not you saying No, but it remembers that apple instead. Yesterday I was actually REALLY proud of myself. A client brought in pumpkin pie and mike MADE me have a piece, meaning he cut it put it on my desk until I took a bite. It was a long wait for him. I took a few bites and then was satisfied I didnt need any more! Yeah ME! I also learned you need to eat your protein FIRST. I knew I needed protein but you need to eat the PROTEIN FIRST. HELLO THIS WOULD REALLY HAVE HELPED ALL THESE YEAS OF STARVING TO DEATH! Right now, I feel like a plush  person. Not fat, just a little extra padding, because I guess the skirt I wore isnt TOO flattering on me, and I thought it looked okay, but I guess not. Maybe it does and I am just thinking bad.

And like they say, time heals all wounds...it does. The more time we have spent not being together the more it hurt, BUT the better WE were together. Tonight he went to his Aunt and Uncle's. My actual favorite Aunt and Uncle on his side of the family. He told me he would call me on his way home. I went about my usual family dinner deal and then for whatever reason passed out. I get a phone call from some people I think are a scam, and then from there I got a phone call from Scott. I woke up with my blood sugar low, and right away he offers to drive me to the hospital. I was like awwww you are too cute. Im glad that he took such an interest in my diabetes. I dont know if I should be announcing the next thing he said, but it made me happy,and I am SICK of writing what terrible things happened. SO TOO BAD! He told me he missed me. I said funny that, I miss you too. Then some moments passed with other filled conversation, and I asked him what made him miss me, and he just gave me the sweetest answer. I thought about how much happier my life is with you in it. And this is where we cue the AAAAAAWWWWW isnt he cute music, and my insides melt, and I feel appreciated. I never wanted to leave, and once I got over the whole shock of him not being there, I was okay to go on with my everyday life, but all I ever wanted to hear and feel was appreciated, for him to think that for one moment, I actually might not be there the next time wants me to be. Im not saying I was ready to give up (HELL NO, Im a fighter) but I just wanted to feel appreciated. Im not saying that okay it happened one time things are all better he NEVER has to do that again, but I am saying props to the man I fell in love with a year ago. Things will work out. I know that with time and how we talked last night (two adults NOT screaming or yelling, just this is this that is that talk)if we can salvage some of our arguments like that, then we can do this MUCH easier. As for now I was instructed to go get some sleep where in my dreams Scott would be waiting...DAMN I shoulda been sleeping minutes ago"

"event","Im being selfish today. Instead of reading everyone elses lj first, like I usally do. I am entering first. Lets start with this weekend. Friday I went to the mall and turne in some applications, and then I was offered an interview with Gadzooks. I went to the interview on Saturday and it went pretty well. I keep complaining how I have to work two jobs to make ends  meet, but I guess like anything, once I get used to it, it will all be okay. I figure one of a few things will happen (all positive btw) one I lose the weight I have been bitching about because I wont have time to eat all that much except some handy fruit on my way to the mall. THEN when i get home all Im gonna wanna do it get in the shower and sleep so that elimanates eating when I get home. Two I will make some extra cash, pay off some bills all meanwhile saving some dough. I figure by taking half of my check and putting that towards bills, and then the other half in savings, in NO time I will be able to sign a lease. Went up to cinnabon AFTER my interview to be molested via cinnabon counter. I am NOT kidding. The guy was TOTALLY hitting on me. Usually I would enjoy it, but this time I felt as if I was being undressed by a sleezy Cinnabon worker. Lets just say if I get the job at Gadzooks, that this guy could be my 'sugar daddy' LOL I am SO funny sometimes. Anyhow got Scott a Cinnabon, and then we hung out all day. I tried to keep quiet but I couldnt. I took a short nap and then I woke him up. It was a good thing I did, because Brian called moments later and him and Heidi were going to be over in a few moments. We all had pizza, minus Scott, I made him noodles instead, and then Brian put together Scotts desk and we all laid around and watched. They went home, passion took over and we were fooling around on the kitchen floor. It was so fun and exciting...totally not us. Then we went our seperate ways. I got home and I got a phone call from him saying he wanted to say hello and make sure I got home okay. I melted. THAT is what I miss. I listened to this Brad Paisley song this morning and there was this line about how he bought her everything she thought she wanted and deserved but then he realizes now that all what she really wanted was free. MEN TAKE NOTE. Yes, I LOVE the flowers and the trips and the CDs, but I love even more is the time I get to spend with him on those trips, and the homemade CDs, and I would even keep hung proudly a picture of flowers. Sunday was kinda rough. I went shopping for my mom. I was shocked I slept until 8:30. Came home and I was unpacking the goods, when I actually paid attention to the pudding I bought, and it said Cook and Serve, I was MAD at myself. Went downstairs to ask my mom if I had to acutally COOK the pudding or if I could make it as if it was instant, she explained the proper way to make it without the skin forming on the top, then I go thanks and start to walk away, and she goes...ummm Mike is having your phone turned off next billing cycle. UHHH HELLO!?!?!?! Did someone want to warn me there was a HUGE BUS about to hit me? I was angered. So what do I do...breakdown. WHY over the stupid friggin' phone I dunno it seemed like a good thing to cry over. AND since I wont have anyone to cry to because I will have NO phone its all good. SO then I go to the garage to get a pop, come back and my MOM is climbing into my bed. I thought she just wanted to talk but she came in (probably because she was hot and wanted to kinda bond) to put on her make up. She left, I went to make a sandwhich just to find out the meat was no good which is comforting considering my parents ate it for dinner last night! I started to make my bread and everything before I realized that the turkey was no good. I was miffed. FIRST the pudding then the phone NOW this. I started to cry again. I eventually called Scott, made a salad (cause you know why not eat the same thing DAY in and DAY out?)and then headed to Scotts. I was so crabby I debated on whether or not I should go. I went and Im glad I did. We spent the whole aftenoon being playful, napping, holding hands kissing, and what do you know appreciating one another. It felt nice. Im such a sucker when that boy doesnt feel well. Later on he let me use his electric razor and I helped him shave which I thought was cool. Then I was sitting on the floor watching him, like a son watches his Dad get ready for work, and then we had a semi serious talk. It ended okay. I wasnt looking for a direct answer I was looking for an idea. I ended up in tears on my way home because I am faced with so many challenges and I am not sure how to handle them. I want Scott in my life, but I dont want him there if he doesnt WANT to be there. I woke up this morning after what felt like a crappy nites rest and I turned on my computer and I let my fingers do some typing. My fingers typed an email to Scott. The slower my heart beat, the faster my fingers typed. The email was not filled with its this or thats, it was filled with THIS is how I feel about you, this is what I need, this is what I want from US. Im scared and have been tempted many times to delete it but I cant and I wont. I didnt say anything nasty, and I didnt blame anything on him or I. I needed to do this because forever I keep inside what I feel and whats bothering me, and then it blows up.  I am trying VERY hard to say right then and there what is bothering me. I cant fully commit to right then and there, but I am getting better. This is honestly the first time that something has come up that I needed to speak up about. The worst case senerio which I think we are both too mature for this to happen like this, is he gets pissed on about the email and we never talk again. Which hurts and bites ass, but I cant control him any more then I can control the weather. I seriously doubt it would come to that, but Im saying this is the WORST case. Best case...he knows how I feel, and we work off of that. I am so distracted right now. I didnt get to eat much for breakfast because I was running so late, so I had homemade trail mix and a diet orange soda. I am acutally looking forward to my lunch which is an apple, bananna, and some apple sauce. As for now...I must sign online and work. I know I know I gots the messed up priorites."

"event","Im just trying to see through my contacts, and I am trying to make it one day at a time. Im at Scotts and Ive woken him up. I feel bad. Im going to be banned from sleep overs if this keeps up. I went on an interview at Gadzooks today. Went well I think. Basically I will be hired if they run my back ground and everything checks out okay. I SURE HOPE they dont find out about those previous managers I have murdered. Sadly enough my lightened mood has turned grey again. Yesterday I was happy because my jeans fit MUCH better. I am however just in a spiffy, icky mood. Even the hispanic guy who hit on me at Cinnabon today didnt make me feel good. I was actually creeped out by it, and had to fib and tell him just HOW MUCH my 'boyfriend' LOVES Cinnabon which is why I am here. He probably spit on Scotts Cinnabon after that. He gave me change and at then goes, 'okay sweetie, have a good day'. I just kinda smiled and thought WHERE IS SCOTT WHEN YOU REALLY NEED HIM TO GRAB YOUR BREAST? I should go home. Leave Scott to sleep. I just dont want to be at home either. I feel like I dont belong anywhere, or with anyone. Like I dont have a place anywhere but taking up space on this earth. The best way to describe how I feel right now is to imagine a jammed pack party, and then there in the corner, sitting down, quiet as all can be is me. Its not Scott who makes me feel this way, its just I feel empty and like I dont belong anywhere. I want to cry and scream in aggravation but it just doesnt seem like anything is going to make this moment better.Its not like anything is truly terribly WRONGWRONG, but it just doesnt seem right. Im gonna go download some ring tones or something. I just need not to think of stupid things right now."

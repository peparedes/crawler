You changed my life and all my goals.
And love is blind and that I knew when,
My heart was blinded by you.
I've kissed your lips and held your head.
Shared your dreams and shared your bed.
I know you well, I know your smell.
I've been addicted to you..</center>"

1. I shall think more about ducks.

2. I shall whistle more and do more of my bird calls.

3. I shall have more afternoon naps.

4. Umm... that's all i can think of at the moment.

5. Oh yes... I've just remembered, I will finish composing my mandolin concerto called ""The Duck Concerto.""

6. ...and maybe something about butterflies."

"event","So the silly girl spent most of her time being blurry but when she was still i got some pictures.
She looked so pretty.
The only thing that annoyed me was the well, the two things were the drunk couple next to me who would stop making out and the girl was Piiiiised! and get was all wobbly and shit so i figured i'd stand REALLY close to her and breath heavy and sway and stuff and she told her boyfriend [EVENTUALLY] that she was ill and they left ^_^.
<lj-cut text=""Heeep"">
So THEN imogen came out after some SEXY celloist and a Crazy drummer friend.

So...<a href=""http://photobucket.com""><img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y120/saynighty_night/IMGP6240.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Image hosting by Photobucket""></a>

First she came out and said hello and then introduced Canary Cello or whatever her name was...windsong... and said she'd be back later cause she had to have a spot of dinner.

Then she was hot.

Oh yer i forgot...the only other thing that annoyed me was the whisper from the crowd that was just..whsisis-'The Oc'-psspwswsw-Oc-wsws-yer say goodn....pawswss.
Fuck at you.

Anyhow, it turned out a fucking fantastic night. Joe and i buzzed around london before we got out train back to Cambridge Uni which is where im staying with him for a couple days...Then im back to Blondon and then Europe baby.

The page you are reading with your two eyes-assuming you are in fact reading this page, and that you only have two eyes-is one of two texts in the world which will show you the difference between the word ""nervous"" and the word ""anxious."" The other text of course is the Dictionary, and if i were you i would read that instead.
Like this text, the dictionary shows you that the word ""nervous"" means 'Worried about something'-you might feel nervous, for instance if you were served prune icecream for dessert, because you would be worried that it would taste awful-whereas the word ""anxious"" means 'troubled by disturbing suspense,' which is what you might feel if you were served a live alligator for dessert, because you would be troubled by the disturbing suspense about whether you would eat your dessert or it would eat you, and that is exactly what i am feeling, Anxious.

My flight leaves in not that many hours, and i am going crazy.

<b><lj-cut text=""The Orange-Man Got Me.""></b>
I Belive i will start with a passage from one of my favourite books, Which seems pretty suited to the events of my day.
""If you were to take a plastic bag and place it inside a large bowl, and then, using a wooden spoon, stir the bag around and around the bowl, you could use the expression 'a mixed bag' to describe what you had infront of you, But you would not be using it in the same way i am about to use it now. Although ""a mixed bag"" sometimes refers to a plastic bag that has been stirred in a bowl, more often it is used to describe a situation that has both good parts and bad parts. An Afternoon at a movie theatre for instance, would be a mixed bag if your favourite movie were showing, but if you had to eat gravel instead of popcorn. A trip to the zoo would be a very mixed bag if the weather were beautiful but if all the man and woman-eating lions were running around loose.""
My day was a mixed bag because, However enjoyable it was, the bad parts were very very bad.

My day began with [Actually on reflection my day really wasn't that enjoyable at all] I just seem to make light of a bad situation when a clearly worse one proceeded it.

Cody picked me up [Actually really looking back on it my day was really bad.] from my house and we were watching some stupid show about carrots and we ended up leaving knowing we'd be in a rush for the bus to Kelvin Grove. So, we got to casteldine JUST as james messaged us saying the free loop bus had left.
So, we ended up saying we would meet him at Kelvin Grove because we were going for breakfast.

When we got to Kelvin Grove we drove and drove and Kelvin Drove and there was not a single car park anywhere. So we messaged james ONCE again, [After having to buy petrol because the indicator kept hitting against the empty 'E'.] So we told James we would meet him at Gardens point, and the ONLY place we could get a park that we felt safe in [After a previous towing incident involving both Cody, Myself, Sam and a burleigh Tow-Truck driver who didn't seem to think trading sex from three young supple boys for our car back free of charge was funny.]
So the ONLY safe parking place we got ended up costing us like 14 dollars or seomthing for the hour that we were there, i ordered the wrong coffee, i didn't <i>Get</i> to order my Vegetable Panini and James was running late for his lecture so he had to leave. 

So Cody and I hopped back in the car and decided to drive to the Valley to take nice pictures and what not and eat or something. [Most of our time is spent accomplishing random ideas that pop into our heads.]
So we parked in New Farm, and walked to the Valley and took some nice pictures and whatever, and decided to get maccas. [ Number one, big mistake, number two...is it just me or is everyone in the valley mall maccas wierd but you just dont seem to care cause the only time you USUALLY go in there is on a night out when ur too drunk to care. ]
Yer, Big Mistake. Felt Sick.

Then, Cody [who stupidly ordered <i>Two</i> Quater Pounders?] [Anyone who decides it's time to eat half a pound of processed meat should be slapped with it] was holding the Camera and we were walking along and he didn't eat his second burger so he gave it to me and said..'Urgh, i don't want it, You give it to someone.'
So the first nice mad i offered it too didn't seem to ant a burger, free of charge. and the second man i offered it too clearly wanted more than a small squirt of special sauce.. [disregarding the lack of special sauce on a quaterpounder burger.]
So, i held out the burger as he was walking past and he looked at me and took it and said [Keeping in mind, he was NOT a bum, he was about 56, semi well dressed [although vile] and he said to me. 'Is this for me?'
I said, yes.
to which he [Quite rudely] Replied, ""Is this all i get?!""
Cody [Whislt filming this on camera, so don't worry we have proof] :P said, "" oh there's two packets of Ketchup in there, so..you can have them and he said once again..
""Is this all i get?"" I Said..oh Napkins, and pulled out two from my pocket. [I always seem to take far too many napkins form places and end up keeping them in my pocket but they always seem to come in handy] Anyhow, i handed him the napkins and he looked at them and flipped them over and said.. 'Isn't the your number on these Napkins? and i looked at them and said... ""Um..No Sorry."" He replied, ""It should be."" 
cody politely said Bye and we ran in the opposite direction, the entire length of the valley Mall and i had to wait, sitting, agaisnt a pole outisde Belushi's rocking back and forth for cody to catch up, and we were both terrorfied. We couldn't stop laugihng though, he was the yukkiest man, and the fact that he took the burger and <i>Still</i> wasn't satisfied, hurt and insulted me. 

So, Cody and i waslked back into New Farm and drove off, and we were just out of the valley and coming over the hill towards the Hospital and We stalled. The car behind us [A Bright Blue Holden Ute] beeped and honked and Cody and i just waved out the window...and then i belive, he stalled <i>his</i> car. 
So, He was Drivey B. Grouch behind us, and when we pulled up next to him a bit further down the road we both smiled and waved at him. 
[Now, i think this is the difinative part of my story in wihch it takes a turen for the worse]
The Driver of the ute, who i assume was a builder because he seemed to have the IQ of a towel didn't seem to enjoy Cody and Myself's Hospitalable wave and smile. It just seemed to anger him. 

So, he decided to follow us in a rageful manner. He was tail-gating us and we drove all the way to Kedron and he wouldnt stop following us, so we turned down stafford road and he [To use a quote from every film] 'was hot on our tail.' So, We saw all this traffic ahead and there was a red light and Cody and I were like..What do we do?! So cody slowed down, and the Ute man, tried to pull up beside us, but some lady pulled in front of him and stopped him [Thank Fucking Christ] So, The lady drove off and i said to Cody, just Quickly turn down that street and we'll loose him. So, Cody indicated and this made the man Very angry, So, he swerved out over several lanes and blocked our car so we couldnt go striaght ahead, and he was blocking ALL this traffic on Busy Stafofrd Road, so Cody and i quickly turned and he followed and cody had nowhere to go, there was a no through road and a one little lane thing, so we turned down there and the man followed and by now Cody and i are terrorfied, So... We came to another red light but pulled into a gas station and were winding down the windows screaming at anyone we could. The man kept following us, so we pulled another evaisive manouver outta there and got back onto Stafford Road heading back in the opposite way we just came. He kept following so i pulled out my Phone and tried calling other James twice, but apparently A phone with 'Withheld Number' isnt important enough! anyway, i finally found in my phone the number for mobile phone Police and it was ringing and i looked back and showed the angry, Angry man i was on my mobile and im like nodding and he mouthed, something along the lines of... 'Fucking call them!'
[Take a narrative novel approach to this passage]

Two rings...
The Phone Connected..
The man on the other line had an accent and i couldnt understand what he said to me, my hands we sweaty and shaking and i could see the angry ute drive in the rear view mirror.
I told the man on the other end that there was a man that wouldn't stop following us, and he was terribly agressive looking. The calm man on the end of the line repeated what he said previous...
i heard it this time. 'Police, Ambulance or Fire'?
Police i said.. Having never called the police before the adrenaline from that, plus the chase had my heart beating too fast.
'The line connected again'..
'Police, what is your emergency?' This man's voice was even calmer than the first. He was also Australian.
I was shaking like crazy, 'There's a man in a bright blue ute, who is road rage chasing us.'
I didn't know what to say..
'What is your Location?' The man asked?
'Kedron i said, the corner of Gympie road and Stafford Road.'   
'Is the Persuit still in Progress' the policeman said.
I looked over my shoulder. Too scared to stick my head out the window i tured and saw the man pull off into a side street and vanishing with a beep of his horn and a hand signal that didn't look nice.
I put the phone back to my ear, it was sweaty and cold. 
'He's gone now i said, but we were just terrorfied.'
'Can i get your name?' 
'Gareth' i told him... 'G-a-r-e-t-h.'
He asked me my last name and i spelt him that aswell.
'..and you live in McDowall he asked?' I told him that was correct.
He asked me if i would like to make a formal complaint. I said  'No.' and i thanked him and hung up.
Cody and i took the back streets home.

We didn't stop fucking shaking for about an hour and a half afterwards.
Cody said a funny thing, You watch those Oprah specials where they test to see if you can remember details about criminals and things like that.
In a moment of fear and panic, you don't seem to remember in great detail things about the man that is trying to car you down.
Luckily, im a quick thinker and managed a picture of the gentleman.
<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y120/saynighty_night/Imgp2941.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
He looked like a fish crossed with a pudding.

Cody and i got home and decided it was enough excitement for one day.
We watched a film and cody decided to leave to go to his house...Which soon enough won't need be the case.
Every Ute we saw on the way home terrorfied us. 

I laughed alot today, which is good i guess.
I bought a sexy jacket for five dollars. [Which doesn't imply much of a sexy..but..you'd be surprised]
I guess my day was a mixed bag after all.
[Love]
</lj-cut>

Siiigh. Never a dull day. :)
Take care.

"event","Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses.
They feel the heat,
The heat between me and you.

Touch if you will my stomach.
Feel how it trembles inside.
You've got the butterflies all tied up.
Don't make me chase you,
Even doves have pride.

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold.
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold.
Maybe I'm just like my mother?
She's never satisfied, with eachother.
This is what it sounds like 
When doves cry."

Had my sister's Grad-ya-ation yesterday.
She goes away on Sat, so ill terribly missing her.

Um..Work was good fun today.
A girl came in and said she had to work till nine o'clock and that she didn't have any dinner so i told her i would make her dinner, so i went and bought a plate and some noodles and snow peas and mushrooms and things of this nature and made her up some yummy stir fry and put it in the fridge at work so when she comes in (cause i finished EARLY) my work will heat it up for her and she'll have Yummy warm dinner.

she was a bit unsure, but i told her to come in and just say. 'Gareth had dinner for me here?' and they'd know what she was talking about ;)

Bowling was hotdogs fun.

I believe im moving out.

Sam is coming back to Brookside to work because he quit his traineeship.  ^_^

Cody is finally out of debt to me. Hoorah.
and...that's all.
Hope you're all well. 
Love Love.

EDIT:: I forgot to tell you i had the scariest craziest dream ever children, i dreamt i was walking along the street at night and these two REALLY creepy people dressed as crows attacked me so i climbed up this big podium thing in the middle of no where that was actually a cliff, and then i climbed up there it and it was pretty fucking tall and then i don't know where form, but james started climbing this podium thing too (im assuming to get away from the crow people) and, he was near the top and i put my arm out to grab him to pull him up, and i was pulling him up, but...i slipped off the edge and fell. it was scary. not alot of dreams i wake up from, but i  woke up from that.

Nick rang me (we all remember big nick from work) and he was terrorfied because Carl our Manager who is a skieze wantefd to have a meeting with him and nick didnt know what it was about so he rang me and i was all i have no idea why Carl wants to have a meeting with you (Knowing fine well Carl was going to fire him)
But nick had an exam the next day and he was stressing out and he said that if Carl wanted to say something he'd rather he just said it over the phone now so he wasn't worried for his exam.
So i rang carl and told him what nick said and Carl said oh Gareth..you just fire him.

So...i had to ring Nick back, who is a good friend of mine and Fire him from our store cause Carl is an Axe-wound.
It wasn't a fun thing to do, but lucky im professional. ^_^

More doctors appointments, more Anti-Biotics, throw in an optomitrist appointment and Melinda getting Back from Holidays, firing Nick, Forgetting to put people on the payroll so they don't get paid and then get shitty with me..Is pretty much my shitty fucking ass week.

So, hopefully when i get back i'll be happy and things.
I hit my head on the over door today and it fucking hurt like mad. 
Melinda still thinks sh'e stop shit and the rude bitch was actually jealous and envious of me because SHE wanted to fire nick. Urgh, what a whore.
I'd like to fire her the day before an exam.

"event","I don't really know where to begin, so i guess i will use Robert Frost's adive when he said, 'You're searching, Joe, for things that don't exist; I mean beginnings. Ends and beginnings -- there are no such things. There are only middles.'

Which means, i guess i will begin in the middle of my story (Which begun 18 years ago, when i woke up bloody and moist.)
Nothing much happened in between but this morning i wopke up at 6:30 and caught a bus to a trian station and hopped on a train and then got off and waited for another train (In which time cody and I spoke to two ladies and wanted a photo with them but the only way to make them be in it was if we pretended we were from London and said it was our last day in Brisbane) old fools. ha


So we waited and caught the train down to Nerang and got off and caught a bus which let us off at Pacific Fair. We wanted to go beach and silly us didn't look, so we didn't get a bus so we walked the 4 Km to Caville. In hindsight it wasn't that bad, and it made us want to swim more. So we were carrying heavy bags  and we went into the toilet to get changed and they were empty and i walked up to the filthy door and didn't want to touch it so i kicked it open slowly and there was a man standing in there, and i absolutely SHAT myself and Cody and I ran away.
Then, we went and got changed in Macca's toilets.
Then we went swimming and we took pictures of hotties 
(when ever Cody and i are together we always BLATENTLY take pictures of attractive people :S) 
Then we swam and by this time it was 1:10 and lunch reservations were at 2:30 so we had to hurry so we got changed into hot clothes and caught the bus down to the resturant, my meal was possibly the BEST food i have ever tasted, i had veal and things and truffles and it was totally worth the $110.oo. 

Then we walked over the casino for a drink and a gambley gambley.
Which i lost my money and drank my drink and we decided to go home so we made friends with a hottie named Mark at the train station but he got off in i dunnoo..somewhere Gross.. and we were alone THEN i was supposed to go to movies with Tony and that for Hannah's birthday, but i just came home cause i was completely tired.

And ALL our photos we took ALL day got wiped somehow on the train home, and i MAY be woorking in the resturant i had lunch at at Surfers AND Micheal messaged me again asking if i was still living at home and how i was. Ew.

AND i got the strangest message.
but im far to tired to type about it..basically a gir
sigh ill type it so it makes sense
I went to a production ages ago with my Friend Yvette and aftrer it i didnt talk to her for ages and apparently she got snooty so i was drunk yesterday (wait, was NOT drunk) and sent her a message saying i was sorry and i was a prick and friends?
she rpelied with..r u gay?
I said..yer..what made u aske that tho?
She said. ' i thought you were hot like HOT hot whyd u have to be gay? some girls at uni said u  were so i thought id ask, home embarassing i feel like a loser. Friends?
Yeah, wa-ever.

So..that's basically it. i'm quite boring. and you're quite bored.
In the words of Micheal a. Phillipson...

'fuck off.'"

"event","So...
Lots has happened.

The thing with Melinda is...i don't know. Apparently  she is becoming assistant manager or so i hear, so i asked her if she did all that shit just to make me look bad so she could get the job...i told told her i didn't care about the position and wa-ever. She didn't REALLY answer me. wa-ever.

Carl said my close was good so fuck you. 

I went to an 18th last night which was in Bracken-ridge.
At least Sam was there, but you know...
Beer bongs strewn across lawns. We weren't even at the party and we'd heard the word 'cunt' so much.
We were loners..but..get a few drinks into me and..haha.
It was the kind of protective parent party where you had to have your name ticked off at the door :S. wa-ever.

Everyone there was hot. Except straight and terrorfying. But i started talking to people. 
Ya! omg...there was a guy there who did prac at my school (he's like 23 or something and kinda hot)
so i was talking to him about shitty padua and he's like what kinda of school did you WANT to go to?
i said anything but there...somewhere which had drama perhaps. and he said Nudgee has good drama. and Lizzy who was pissed said, 'Nudgee is for fags.'
he goes 'I did drama at Nudgee [hot].'
Then lizzy's like..oh im sorry..he's all..  'yeah, don't touch me.'
Ha...it was hot!

So some girl i forget her name wants me to go to the valley next froday cause (ha) some girl called Lina! it's her last day in Australia or someshit...so..wa-ever.
She was fat.

I got out of opening at work in the morning and oh..hehe..remided me..some girl came into work (who comes in sometimes) she's like grade 12 or wa-ever and a geek. hot geek. :S
and she comes up to the counter and is like how's your sex life??'
'um..Bollocks.'

so..yer... tlaked to poeple, Yukky cheap Daquiri machine...3/4 my bottle of vodka..:S
it was an ok night..
No homeless girls to kiss there, so it was clean.
ha.

sue drove us home and totally saved us cab fare.
Fuck i hate sue.
:P

Wa-ever.
it was hot.
Take care-"

"event","So...
I accidentally, inadvertantly swallowed all my toothpaste the other morning while i was brushing my teeth.
I was just brushing normally and went *hurk* and swallowed it all and then felt sick for the rest of the day. It was yukkers.


So i got to work (on SAD-ter-day) and the other supervisor had gone somewhere and i was sitting out the back and guy said, 'Oh, mindy was going to have a word with you about your shit close.'
So mindy came back and saw me and goes..Hello Darl :)
i said...'don't.' 'If you're gonna have a word with me don't come in and pretend to be nice.'
oh well, um..

So apparently she rang carl the manager and bitched cause i didn't do something right apparently...
and i went RANK!
'If you want to go rigning Carl every three seconds ause you prefer your name to be in big letters up on the notice board thats fine, i thought we used to look out for each other.
she goes, 'i was just looking out for you, cause you needed a talking to.'
I walked out and said, 'Well you can talk to me or Carl can talk to me, i don't give a damn!'
and slammed the door.

I came back and she was crying..wa-ever.
THEN the bitch left half an hour early and i had the shittest day and the store was CRAP there was shit everywherew and it was so dirty.
And i look up and the boss and owner of the store was standing there.
lol i died as much as she did trust me...
So..she goes. ill pretend i didnt come in here ill be back in ten minutes, and as she was walking off i yelled out.. 'make it 15!'
so she came back and i had the store heaps good again and she's like that's better..
then she asked me how i was and i said tired and sick and depressed and stuff and she was all, why you depressed and whats wrong?
Then she said she was leaving and asked if i could see her outside for a second and she said...
..Have you been doing anything you shouldn't have on the weekends that might be making you tired and depressed?
'Are you asking me if im on Drugs?'
'no no..i wouldn't do that..'
'no you are asking me if im on drugs..I'm not on drugs'
'Oh i know that..i know you wouldn't do that.'
'what-ever.'
<b>She asked me if i was on drugs</b>!!!!!?!?!?!?!
I should have said yes.

whatever, my weekend was Bollocks and im feeling less happy than happy.


Love you, bitch.

I replied, 'no, you can send me home, but you cannot make me take it out. would you like me to be sent home? Because that's fine, if it is a problem.
(i started to pack up my things and he said..Oh no no, you're closing, you can't go home)
i said, 'Well we'll just leave the piercing then shall we?' *Goes back to work*
THEN, my RICH BRITISH boss, owner of my subway came in and was standing on the other side of the counter and pointer at <b>Her</b> ear, where <b>My</b> piercing would be and goes whats this?!
i said..'Thats your ear'
She said..No no..when did you get that done?
'autumn..urgh..i don't know, several weeks ago.'
'Well, when can you take it out?'
'Um..months perhaps, i couldn't tell you'
she said, 'Well, as soon as you can take it out dont wear it to work? deal? and if Alison (The subway head office evaluator who can shut down our stores) comes in, you take it out straight away.
How does EAR = FACIAL piercing?

so, What ever. 
Closed with Erica, (got out early)
There's a guy in grade 12 who comes into my work like every afternoon, and talks to me, his name is Lachlan, and he's attractive. whatever, anyways...he keeps inviting me to go watch his footy games and i do not want too.
I gave him free cookies :P

So...my doctor rang me at work after i'd finished and said i need to go in there at 11:30 tomorrow to talk about results and shit. sigh, wa-ever.

Oh! James, i have work 7-3 on thursday, so ya..shopping = difficult. (don't know if you're still going) Anyways, i have an assignment due Friday so if i can try and finish it tomorrow wa-ever. Ya..anyways...
work = Bollocks.
uni = Bollocks.
and....That's pretty much it.
hope you're all well.

Take care,

[Hearts & Loving]

Ha!
Just remembered some lady came into work today and mindy served her, and the lady came back to get cookies and mindy tried serving her, and she was speaking too fast or something and the lady looked terrorfied, so i stepped in and said, ya ya..these are the cookies we have etc..these are yummy..
And the lady was like, ""That girl made me unnerved, especially when she served me, i didn't like it""
I said 'yeah, she's terrorfying and stuff""
'Oh i know, thanks hun, you made it easy.'
'<b>YOU</b> make it easy :D!
*she giggled and left*
My customers are Hot. i love them. Except the ones i hate! Grrr..
:P
Take care -"

"event","Sooo, went to the coast with Cody, and i made a hot arse mix tape and we put it in, and..it didnt work his tape player was fucked and we couldnt getthe tape out then so we couldnt listen to the tape and we couldnt listen to thew radio cause the tape was stuck...and the only way we could get it to work was if i jammed my keys in there and held the tape up. And as soon as we got off the exit to surfers our gear stick fucked up (this is about 11:30 am)and we got broked down and we had to wait for racq. But racq said they needed a service station we nominated to be dropped off at, so we rang fucking everywhere trying to find the number for the closest service station but couldnt get shit...so...we said wa-ever, and put out our towels and sunbaked on the middle of a traffic island in a busy street and people were driving past and yelling shit we couldnt even understand. Why waste your time and energy? fuckers... (i have photos from the whole day ill do a pixtas post soon){cody wanted to go to the beat tonight but he was driving so we had to come home early} [wa-ever im still drun']

So then we got towed and they had to figure out what was wrong with it {and i had a disposable camera for the day but by the time we handed the car in we used up all the film} so we went to the shops across the road and had a nasty roast chicken sandwhich from fucking hick town shopping centre, and u could so tell everyone was looking at us..wa-ever. (i had a merangue in the shape of a penguin) Merangue and chocolate? Who thought that shit up!?
Then at like,...3:30 we went back and the car was juuust getting finished so we drove to surfers and by the time we got to the ACTUAL beach it was like 4:15..so..wa-ever.
We swam for a bit. Who wears DT's still? honeslty..he was like fucking 18 i swear..Water was cold too, that shit aint flattering. 

So we got out of water and went down to star bucks (so many derros down there they're all bare-foot and pony tails and shit.) We got HOT (they're fucking HOT) pictures taken in a boothy thing for shits and giggles and then we drove home and decided to go back in to the valley. I'm sitting on a stool and this guy is sitting next to us with his friend (she was awesome) but he friend Razul was sitting opposite me and leaning with his hand onto my stool like right between my legs, and he's saying shit like 'Do you think im a good dancer?' Cody and i are like..'yea..'
(After we'd JUST finished saying to each other he was the worst dancer we'd ever seen)

so...just got home now, and got work tomorrow...and thats pretty much it. 
Fucking tired, had a big day and i couldnt be bothered putting pictures in (even tho they'e funny and hot) atm, so wa-ever.
Do it later.
Fuckin funny day."

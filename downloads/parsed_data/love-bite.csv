THEN to add to my anger i had to come home and go and pick my wee brother up from school so i come home on the train and its pissing down in dumbarton aswell, i get my brother and realisebi hadnt eaten anythin all day so i went to mcdonalds where i see my other brother, who btw was supposed to be workin and thsi was the reason he couldnt pick alex up. RAGIN. to top this all off he was with his friend in his car and then they just drove right past us when they were goin back to my house anyway and left us to walk home in the pouring rain. *bites knuckle*

so i get home and calm myself down and fone joann to find out if were still goin into town tonight an what do ya know. were not. after i trapsed up to town to change my jeans for wearing tonight and everythin. instead were goin to drug central, i mean lauries house :p. even thought shes not gonna be there but apparently sarah is watchin her house while shes away. just incase anyone is wonderin laurie is joanns supervisor in work. it should be okay cos i'll just get drunk but everyone else will be tanning e's and im just not up for that sort of nonsense bu if theres some smack on the otherhand....

naw but i was supposed ot go sum mad recruitment thing about 10 o'clock this morning but OBV i slept in. so me and joann the man decided to go the job centre instead. we musta been in for about a bloddy hour and job centres seem to have some sort of heating problem every time i go on one i always seem to become uncomfortably warm which makes me wanna leave straight away. but i was good this time and managed ot wait and see the guy and got sum application forms *fingers crossed*

2nite there is talk of going ot leonas but i'll have to speak to joann first and see whats happenin. 

im hungry. goodbye."

"event","so yes went to the gig last night, watched mendeed and then sat in the bar all night :) ended up chattin for ages to ross and graeme, i hadnt spke to them properly for ages. then me and ross decided to go to the overs after the gig, then joann tells me that natalie was havin a party so i was pure confused as to what to do but in the end decided to go to the catty. she knows why ;)

the gig seemed to finish pure early so we were gonna go to the solid for a few before going to the catty, but then we met sum of ross' friends who were going to underworld so we just went there with them, then they came to the cathouse with us. i actually only spent about a fiver, ross was pure buying me drinks then his friends were too so i was liie..score but then he started buying aftershocks, think he was trying to get me drunk and take advantage of me, haw haw nae chance o that mate :p but aye after a few 'shocks i was pretty steamin and just kinda floated about to see if i knew anyone. spoke to forbes for a while and layla and claire, that was about the only people i knew. danced quite a bit, mainly to hip hop cos ross is a wigga norrat. but the played GLASSJAW, nealry came in ma pants so i did, so i made him dance to that. he didnt seem to amused. i left about 2 cos i was workin 2day which is plain wrong bt then we had to wait about haf a n hour on a taxi then nearly got attacked by a junkie cos ross decided to be cheeky to her, the fool. but luckily we got in a taxi before things got nasty. then i got home and went striaght to bed thinking  theres two chances of me gettin up for work in the mornin, nane and fuck all. but lo and behold i did, feeling like sumthin had cralwed into my stomach and died mind you but hey at least i got up. joann never made tho, shes gettin sacked.....haw j/k btw, but u need to stand up in front of everyone 2moro and explain your absense, i dont make the rules :p

2day i have done nothin but sit online and im still in my pyjamas. it'll probably stay that way for the rest of the day aswell. no wait thats i lie im gonna have to get changed to go to the shop and get juice and possibly some cancer sticks if i can scrape the cash together. boredom sucks ass. seriously.

i REALLY  wanna go to new flesh 2nite, im in the mood for goin out but its not looking likely as a) i dont have anyone to go with which also means B) i dont have anyone to get a taxi home with and i still havent found out if the buses run on a wed night. also if i go out and spend money 2nite that means less money for fri night and for joannes party on sat night which i totally didt realise was this saturday night untill about 5 mins ago. for sum reason i thought the 1st of march was in like 2 weeks or sumthin. but still im in the mood for dancing...romancing..ahem. sorry got a bit carried away.

but aye, i need juiceso it looks like im gonna have to remove my fat ass from this chair and actually do sumthin. :O

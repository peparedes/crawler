"event","I'm sorry about all that happened today.  I have been doing some research into that room and as some of you know, but others might not, the room Trunks went to today is a room that appears in the tower about once every five hundred years.  Within the room, the stream Trunks fell into is known as the ""time stream""  Depending on which way the water is flowing, someone within the stream ages backwards or forwards.  It seems that for Trunks he aged backwards.  Piccolo too has aged backwards, but because only his feet and perhaps a bit of his legs got covered, but his head remained dry, he can still remember everything that's happened to him.  Only his body has aged backwards.  And since he was barely in there, I would say he only aged backwards a few years.  Trunks was in there much longer, which is why he's lost eight years.
<BR>I know some of you are thinking that once the dragon balls are able to be used, we can ask the dragon to restore Trunk's rightful age and his memory, but again, I have to bring bad news.  The power of the time stream and those who created it, far outweighs my own, and the eternal dragon's.
<BR>We could age him faster by having him go into the room of space and time twice a year every year, but that will not restore his memories.  I-I'm so terribly sorry, but I'm afraid I have to say the best thing to do under the circumstances, is to let Trunks live his life again, as a teenager and become an adult.
<BR>Again, I am sorry this happened.  I had no idea that room even existed.  Had I known, I would have taken measures to make sure something like this hadn't happened, but I didn't know. And since it only appears once every five hundred years, Piccolo had no idea of its existence either.    
<BR>Vezelay, I know you have been affected by this the most.  All I can do is say that I am deeply sorry.  If there is anything I can do to help you durring this time, you need only ask.  
<BR>I wish I had more plesant news.  I was hoping I would be able to find a way to make the room appear again so we could perhaps age Trunks forward, but that will not happen.  The room is gone for another five hundred years."

Piccolo is up there now, trying frantically to get the door open, but he's unable to do it.  We have no idea what's in the room or what Trunks is facing.

<BR>I thought I would take a moment to let you know that."

"event","I thought I should let all of you know that Piccolo is with me right now.  We're up in the tower, where I'm sure with some time and healing, he'll be fine.  
<BR>He's still not talking, but at least he's able to move, somewhat function on his own.   I was able to help heal him a bit, but mostly what he needs is some time to do some heavy mediation and thinking and sort things out.
<BR>Let me see if I can explain what I think happened.  As many of you know, a Namek can only fuse with one person in his life time and Piccolo fused with Nail.  However, because he was once a part of Kami, Piccolo was also able to fuse with Kami.  
<BR>The problem, I believe is that Kami and Piccolo were separate people for so long with separate memories and separate personalities.   Now, while the three of them were living Piccolo's lifestyle, Piccolo was in control pretty much and everything was fine.
<BR>But over the last few months, some extreme changes have happened in Piccolo's life.  He's had a child, decided to find someone to live with, lives in a house, has a job, etc. etc.  Which, I'm sure ""Woke up"" the other two personalities.  Nail is used to living a communal life, so he would have more to ""say"" about the situation.  Kami is the oldest and wisest and I'm sure he had plenty of advice to offer.  Piccolo as we all know, likes to think he can handle anything all by himself, so I'm sure he's been mentally in the middle of this.
<BR>The best I can describe it is to say that it would be like living in the middle of two bickering people all the time.  People that mean well, but have their own points of view and think they know best.  And while Piccolo thought he could handle it, he couldn't.  Something inside him finally cracked today, which lead to a total shut down of the physical process. 
<BR>I've heard of this happening a couple times on Namek.  And in both cases, what the person needed to do was to take some time, sort through their feelings and try to merge the personalities within them, or at least come to peace with them.  To do that, he needs a lot of quiet and meditation and some healing as well.  I can't think of anything better than the lookout for such a purpose.
<BR>Hopefully this will only take a few days to a week to correct.  I am warning you, he may be a bit different when he comes back.  I don't know exactly what changes, but I'm sure there will be some.  But I'm also sure, that in the long run, they will be for the better.
<BR>I just wanted to make sure everyone knew he was going to be all right.  And right now he's safe up in the tower getting the rest and quiet he needs.

When Mr popo and I got to the wedding I was a little nervious that Vegeta might still be mad at me. Plus I was nervious about seeing Palu for the first time I wasn't sure why I was about the last thing.

Sonya was beautiful walking down the aisle. Her face was so happy it glowed. Bardock seemed really happy to. I understand why Sonya wanted her cake, it was a truely beautiful cake, to bad people had to eat it, it was a nice decoration.

Except for the little fight between Vegeta and Future Bardock I say it was a pretty normal wedding. I would have been scared if Vegeta got scared of me but Future Bardock sure wasn't. He actually beat Vegeta, he just be a strong fighter. 

Piccilo was right Palu did scream a little but not as much as some namek babies from Namek. But he must be proud fo him he's a good kid. And he does look like Piccilo.

After we got back I colapsed into bed, and fell asleep. I hope you two are having a wonderful honeymoon."

I never realized what you wore was such a big deal. I'm not sure what mr. popo is planing on wearing but i'll probably just wear what i normally do, (even though it has a little white in it.)

Bra seems to think that she's getting to tall, but i think she's just right. There's nothing wrong with being tall. And I agree that you could be a model. You definatly are pretty enough. Don't listen to what other people think, they're just jealous, and i agree with your father about wanting you to be tall, it has it's advantages. I still wouldn't recomind making Nappa mad. He isn't the nicest person when he's mad.

I'm really worried about trunks. At first i was just a little concerned but after what everyone has been saying about what happened and trunks posts, i'm really worried now. I hope he gets better soon, whatever he has. I would hate for him to have to miss the wedding. Which reminds me, i'm pretty sure that i know what i'm getting the couple, but i haven't decided for certain. I definally know they don't already have one.

Piccilo is pregnat, I heard it from Nail. I feel sorry for Nail having to carry around Piccilo's baby. He seems to be sleeping a lot. I doubt Marron will be getting trained much during this time. I know Piccilo didn't do it on purpose (dropping Nail off with the pregnarcy). I'm actious to see what they name it. An earth name might work, if it's not to strange. I still don't understand what a hot dog is. If it isn't made out of dog (which at first i thought it was) why would you name it that? Sorry being up here makes you think to much. 

I haven't seen Yamacha in a while. I hope he and his new girlfriend work out. I'm excited to meet her on saturday, she seems nice. 

So many people from Hell are getting journals now. I'm interested about what goes on down there. I'm also suprized no one has tried to kill anyone else yet (even though they all are dead). Sorry Vegeto. But i don't understand you, and i doubt i ever will. You seem so simpleminded, maybe you aren't maybe you are. Everytime i think i finally understand you, you do something that completely stupid. You seem to like bob a lot, whatever bob is. What's with if 'right is wrong then wrong is right'? I'm curious about why you're in hell. Do you know what is right or wrong? or did you just get stuck in hell to annoy everyone else? Would decides where you end up after you die? Is it King Yama or do you just carry out orders from the Supreme Ki? Maybe I'm thinking about things I shouldn't be thinking about. Please stop me if I get to confusing.

"event","sorry about not posting much. Since there is nothing else to do i'm getting ready for all of my guests. and do you want to know what i figured out?

This place has no interior decoration what so ever you all think i'm mad but i'm being serious here. Living up in the clouds you have a lot of free time which no sales man bother you ::grins:: sorry goku I just had to do that. It's quite bare on the inside expessiouly piccilo's room with only like a mat and a lamp at the most.

Mr. Popo's cooking again and it smells good. I think Piccilo is training somewhere or something. But I did get a costume for the tournament I even have big finger. I didn't understand exsactually what the purpose for a big finger is but the salesman said it's got big meaning. I was down on earth for your information because mr. popo had to go buy some more food and i was bored enough to go along.

But people look at nameks wierd I wonder if Piccilo is bothered by it. One guy even yelled at me that it was to early for halloween."

"event","okay, i've decided that i'm going to fight in the tournament!

just kinding i'm probably to weak to do something like that. I guess my only job is to be a healer, not that i'm complaining, but does anyone want to some up and visit sometimes. Piccilo was sick yesterday and me being the healer didn't even want to go near him. I'm sorry but he has kind of an attitude, but i don't think he ment it."

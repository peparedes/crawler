"event","Oh my God! I have not written in this thing for 4 Years!!!! Well its been a long time and I have changed so much. Iv read all of my entrys and some of them are pretty crazy. Like I said I was young and i am pretty sure that drugs were envolved. I see that some of my entrys were at early times in the morning. I can just imagine what I was doing. And for some reason I barely remember Writing those entrys. Kinda sad but to be honest I wouldnt change my younger years for anything every mistake and accomplishment has made me who i am today. Iv turned out ok so far. 
         I work for an agency called clarity care.I work in a home with 8 clients. All who have developmental disabiltys as well as physical.I love it more than anything. I wouldnt mind changing a few things as well as firing a couple staff, but its ok. As long as the people there are getting taken care  of thats all that matters to me. iv wanted to go back to school and maybe get a start on my career. I dont exactly know what to do yet. I dont want to go back to school not knowing. Im not exactly worried about it. I am still young yet and still have lots of time to find out. Im happy where i stand for the moment. I wish there was some change but I adapt. Ill be moving out of my apartment soon. Ill be moving in with my father. What a treat!?!? Just to catch up with my money cituation.Though I do have good news. I have paid off my debts. Every penny I got back from my taxes i used. I feel like I have a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. Thank god! Well i am going to cut this short here. i will hopefully be writing in here more often."

"event","Well today seems to be not going so well and i am very upset right now.
   Why is that people have to lie about stuff that they dont have to even if it is soo stupid....maybe cuz they are scared that they will get in trouble...and why is it that when you only ask them about it they get defensive and then its all your fault
    Well heres what happened.. i let people use my computer to do whatever they want but i only ask them to not download anything that i would not want on there..like porn..is that so hard for people to understand..
     But i do have another issue...my boyfriend has been staying with me for a couple of days here this last week and when i was looking at the history of my computer just makin sure that there wasnt anything bad you know i found that he was looking for shit on stds..now i dont have any stds i get checked everytime i go in for my shot which is every 3 months...so i am clean in other words...when i had asked him what he was looking for he totally denied it told me to fuck off and hung up on me well i know that it was him and the only conclusion i can come to is that he cheated on me and now he is worried that he has a std..i dont know what the fuck to do or what to say to him i only want him to tell me the truth and if thats not enough then i guess that we are just not meant to be together and its sad to say this but its been 8 months of absoultely nothing accept lies and deception from him and i am done and this time i mean it if he doesnt tell me the truth i will break up with him i do not want to be woth some one that will lie about the dumbest shit in this case could be some thing more then just dumb but im finished with this whole damn world im DONE"

"event","tonight i felt like i was walking an water...i finally think i found what i was looking for...not in myself but other than that...i am no longer scared of what may come or what might be....i have lost only my most precious things on life.but realized that mybe i didnt need them
     i know that god put us here to live our own lives...not for him to look out for ouselves not for him to make our hurt better and our weak stronger but to make us find ourselves no matter how old we are what we have been through...god has nothing to do with ourlives he just created us....i believe that he might not have created us the way he wanted us to be.but he is maker of man and woman.
    through out time there have been amny mistakes that men and woman created the victims of these mistaked often think where is god on our tome in grief..he is there...but not to help...he wants us to find ou rown ways through these times thats what only makes us stronger
     i only hope that when my journey takes place or when i pass away..then ill know that i am only one fo the few that survived this world of uncivilized people..i have made many of my own mistakes..but i now know where the real problem lies...its in our hands not a bigger power or what everyone else believes in
     if this sad and sickened world wont come together then i I will try to do what it takes even if its to take my own life...to make another..or run so another has room i dont want thanks i dont want anything any more from any one..i just want for people to understand....."

"event","well i got what i wished for but i dont exactly like it too much...i wished for all my friends to come back to me and slowely but surly they are coming back my ex fiancee called me today and he apoligized for the shit that happened..that was a huge surprise now i hope we can sstay cool and not have any grudges between eachother..hung out with a really old friend today it was weird i drove down to the park and a car was following me and flahsing there lights so i pulled over and no shit it was my friend justin whom i havent seen for like 2 years..and i was meetin people down there that i also havent seen forever..which was good..we all chatted and had a good time....
    jason and i broke up..nothing new but i really think that its over..the question is am i happy??? no actually i am not....i am tryint to get back together with him but he dont want me back.... i asked to stay cool for awhile and see if things change he said thats fine and then we will talk....but i text him today just saying hi and did not what so ever get a reply back...i think he hates me and it hurts cuz i love him...i have the impression that he just said that to get me off his back....i thought hw would care enough to try again and agin so that some day we get it right...and i hope that we do get back together i wrote him a letter and wrote some poems down hoping that maybe he will realize just how much he really means to me...i would give my life to that boy i just wish i would have shown it more and not close him out like i have done to everyone else... he was the first man i love that is still alive...and with a blink of an eye he is gone..i cant eat i cant sleep..just cant stop thinking about him..i just wish he would feel the same way...but the biggest thing that i am afraid of is that he has alredy found some one else and thats why he isnt returning my phone calls...its been 7 months and i cant even make sense of this any more...its like he treated me soo god damn good that i just took advantaghe of it and threw it in his face which i didnt want to do because i love him...i  miss his touch i miss his arms around me i miss his pretty blue eyes i miss everything about him...should i let him go??? please help!!!!
     i have heard so many damn times that if you love something so much let it go and if it comes back its your forever..i wasnt brought up like that..i was tought too look for what you want in life..make sacrafices only to get it..and when you get it dont let it go..and when you loose it once again you make sacrafices and do anythign to get it back and thats what i will do i will do anythign for him...ill change and keep my head on straight for him so he isnt soo unhappy..i will...
     should i call him or should i wait???? will he come back to me?? should it try?? should i just let him figure out what he really wants??
    My mom says hell be back..i wish i could believe her..i wish he will come back and i think i can wait until the day he does....."

   I went to my best friends babys funeral to day..it was really hard on me..i didnt cry...i wanted to ...but i didnt...she has been my friend since fourth grade and thats a really long time if you ask me...the hardest is that she wouldnt talk to me or even loook at me when i was there...some how i almost got the impression that she didnt even know i was there...but she did.  So now its almost time to go bvack to scholl some enemies of mine might be in some of my classes...so maybe this will give em the chance to make things right with them even though one of them is my ex fiancee..he will be the hardes but i will try..as goes for jason..i am just gonna laugh it off..hahahahaha..nothing better to do then that....somehow today i had the wierdest feeling and it kinda scared me i felt like i could kill some one and like it hahaaha
     A Lot of people say i just feel sorry for myself and that i have pity for my problems and just want attention...but ummm i dont think that only because i dont find people to talk about my problems people just ask ?s so i answer them..once in awhile i will ask about a guy and maybe some advice but my problems are beyond that way beyond boys..i think that people will do whatever it takes just to be ahead of one another...not me i am not as stupid and pathetic as those damn people in the end they will all be alone and wonder why they never made it in life and i I WILL BE SYANDING THERE LAUGHING IN THERE GOD DAMN FUCKING FACES..would i feel guilty hell no!!! after for so many years of being walked on by all those kind of people no way man...i wasted my life on some of those people and they wont see that ever...cuz there always worried about themselves...but its ok.. ill be ok someday and if its not now or not soon...shit..o well cuz ill have it all in the end ill have it all..and people will feel bad that i am gone..and ill have there regrets held in my head and heart..and i will not ever forget all the pain that these people and this world has brought me.
      Maybe its time to say goodbye...only then will people finally see that i wasnt just some peice of shit that everyone thought i was...maybe then will people see that iw as hurting and by then thell know that that hurt was caused by them...then only the pain will begin with them...so maybe they wont make the mistake to hurting some one else and let them die inside like they did me...my time has come and passed and now is the time to not miss it... i will not regret anything...as the saying goes..""dont be sad that its over be gkad that it happened""..well i am not toally happy with what happened to me in my life..but i am glad that i could see that this is just a cold dark place that no one wants and the people are just the same..and as long as i know that i was never one of them i am happy with what has gonae and passed..
    so i lost it big deal it wasnt my fault and with little time people will see nad feel my pain..in time my friends in time...."

For the rest of my life??? or is it just a act???/ What does he really want out of this relation ship??? If he even wants anything???  Why does he even stay around if things are so bad between us???
   For the people that dont understand...dont feel bad cuz i dont even understand myself...All i know i am doing is if anything shall happen where we shall no longer even talk to each other...I am only making it harder for myself to let go...Or should i keep trying until we get it right?
   We are rude and cruel to eachother we have both made mistakes..but no matter what we always end up to gether...maybe not for him but for me the pain still sits in my mind and i always think about the bad stuff that has happened...right now i am unstable and i am not sure if he can yet sense that but sooner or later he will...He will soon see that i somewhat regret our past and scared to see the future..and he will also see pain that we both brought eachother and when he sees this..he will then know that we arent going to make any further then we have....But??? will we?? will we survive through the pain and the mistakes that we will make in the future
    I think that if we just open up our minds juat a little more and respect eahothers feelings we can do whatever it takes..but neither of us i think are willing to stride as far as changing our lives for eachother...which i am willing but signs point that i dont think jason will or can do that...and its not that he doesnt want to i just think that he has to make a choice of whether i am what he really wants in his life..or maybe i realy need to think whether or not i want to spend my life with him... iam young and he is also...so i dont know really what to say or do at this point but just to shut my mouth and let him make his own decisions whether or not he regrets them that is the choice that he has made..and i cant change that for him...But i do just want to add in...is that if and when its over...i dont regret any of things that i have said or done...hence i am not happy that its over but i am glad that it happened..hope fully we can figure this out together and we make the right decisions tog ether but right now i think that we just need to be thinking about our own needs....."

    What i did today was something i told myself never to do...which was never show mt true and hurtful feelings to any one....it was ambarassing but all at once was it sooo relieving....to finally show someone how hurt i was...inside...the betrayal i have felt and the hurt that i have inside...although the only thing that i said was wrong with me was my life...which i guess in some way does that add it all up.....i dotn think i will ever open up to someone like that again only because i like the way people see me the way i am when i am hididng my feelings...but at soem point i know that has to stop....but not now and the cituationsa i am in...it could only turn out for the worse f i do....damnit...I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO ANY MORE!!!!!!!"

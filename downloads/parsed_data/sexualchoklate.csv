"event","you know whats funny? if made an interactive map of all the phases of masturbating over the years. like every few months its something different. i mean roughly.... like theres that one phase where you do it to girls dancing around in music videos. the j-lo video starts playing and you're just sitting on your coach and the idea hits. you start stroking it and you think ""wow, the video is so much better this way!"" then there's the weird HBO porn... like the show with all the old people and europeans doing crazy things that probably fucks you up and makes you have all these weird perversions. then you go to the phase of thinking about people from school, i think thats the freakiest phase, i wont get into details. and then your friend has porn.... that dirty friend....you know the guy, and then right now you're on the phase of really hardcore porn that you're embarassed to be watching. man, there were so many weird phases that i wont even mention.... those are like the least embarrassing."

"event","do you ever listen to a song and you're getting emotional and then you think ""jesus, the lyrics to this song apply directly to my life""... and then you keep listening and half the lines dont apply at all to your life but then in your head after every line you're like ""yeah.... well all of them, except this one."""

Scott,

Sorry it took me a few days to get back to you. I sort of just blanked out after reading your email. Guess it sort of got to me that I finally found you. Anyway, let's get together this week. I can easily catch a train up there and let's find food.

Thanks, and thank Jean for me too.

Jean,

You have my permission to run what ever test you need. I look forward to the results.

11/19/2007


A break between classes finds Scott sitting at one of the work benches on a stool, feet hooked into one of the rungs as he goes over the various papers.  His grading pen of choice? A neon blue of gel ink.  Red ink doesn't show up too easily for the man with the ruby shades and deciphering takes too long to be worth the hassle. A collection of Johnny Lang and Kenny Wayne Shepherd plays from a stereo on the bench behind him.

Passing through the doorway, Alex Masters walks in wearing hiking boots, jeans, brown leather jacket over a blue pull tshirt. He glances around the room for its' occupant and the person he's been directed to by a few students. There's a slight knock on the side of the door facing when he takes note of Scott and he says, ""Hey, I'm looking for Scott Summers.""

""You've managed to find him,"" Scott says, not looking up from the page till the pen tip is hovering over the bottom, having finished all the questions on that page that needed checked.  The pen is put down, the clip keeping it from rolling off the bench as it so desperately wants to do. ""May I help you?"" he asks, raising his chin to focus on the man who spoke.  Ruby shades presenting a small red mirrored view of Alex back to him.

Alex's eyes are very active as he sizes up the man. He's looking for something, the stature, the facial features, the hair, seeking a familiar tone or quality. ""Yeah, I'm Alex Masters. I ran into one of your students the other day, a girl named Alyssa. She told me that I should come talk to you. Something about ... I don't know, that we had something in common."" He left out the most important part, probably because he doesn't want to sound like a lost puppy. Though he does step into the room by a few feet and hooks his thumbs on his front pockets.

""And what would that be?"" Scott asks, not looking for any similarities between their looks.  Why would he? The name 'Alex' is fairly common so it doesn't mean that it's his brother Alex.  Plus 24 years of time make a big difference when the last time you saw them was as an 8 year old looking at a 6.

There's even a reticentence in his voice, ""Yeah, I have no idea."" Alex shrugs slightly, glancing around the room for a second then decides that he should just come out with it, even though it's going to sound really stupid 'to him'. He tightens his lips, pushing them together for a moment longer then inhales and says, ""Guess I was kinda... I mean, so I'm adopted and I had a brother named Scott, we got seperated when we were young..."" He will continue if allowed, but he pauses.

To say that Scott is now gaping at him would be completely accurate, jaw slack for a few moments before it tightens, teeth gritting as he watches the other man.  Scott rises slowly from the stool, making sure to untangle feet before trying to place them on the floor, palms pressed to the surface of the counter. ""This had better not be some kind of joke,"" Scott says as he watches Alex's face and eyes.  After a momentary pause he asks, ""Do you remember anything of your family?""

Goose flesh. Alex feels the hair stand up on the back of his neck and his scalp tingles. He's closer than he's ever been to this and now he's trying not to get hopeful. His jaw also loosens, eyes blink thinking back. Lips part and as he says, ""Nothin really."" he shakes his head. ""I was adopted at 6, there was a lot that happened and.."" he pauses again, trying to reflect and remember, it's a lot to take in and there's some regret forming in his eyes.

""So you were adopted right after the crash,"" Scott says slowly, mis mind turning at the reality of it.  He always wondered if he would ever find Alex, what he'd be like, and here he is. Scott's eyes search out the man's face, looking for similarities to himself and their parents. ""You're here,"" Scott muses, a lightening in his tone and a slight, if unsure, smile on his face.  This is kind of an awkward situation.

Alex reflects to 'back then' and he nods when Scott mentions the adoption right after the crash.  - There is a definite tension forming within Alex's eyes. A furrowing of his brow, struggling to remember. But that's the factor that really cinches it. Crash. The history he was able to discover was that their parents went down in a plane crash. Though he really doesn't remember it. - ""Dude..."" Alex intones losing air in his lungs.

""I gave up finding you years ago,"" Scott says slowly, leaning on the desk now.  How do you act when you face a relative you haven't seen in 24 years?  ""So, you obviously know something about me,"" Scott says, making the assumption since he is at the school, ""So what about you?""

Alex blinks a little, looking down, a sniff and then the fingers of his right hand meet his eyebrows wiping down trying to hide that there are tears forming. ""Man.."" he looks to the side and tries to keep his cool, shifting some on his heels. ""I kept running into dead ends. The agency had no records of who adopted you. Or wouldn't tell me.""

""Which is kind of funny considering I was at the orphanage for almost six years,"" Scott says with a shake of his head, desbelief in his eyes.  Scott doesn't have any tears visible, the few trying to escape hidden behind the shades. ""And I'd pretty much done the same thing,"" Scott says with a shrug, ""hit enough dead-ends that it didn't seem like I'd ever find you unless the court opened the adoption records, which they usually won't without a very good reason.""

Alex is unsure of what to do at this point. He stands there, firm and trying to hold it all in. After another palm across his right eye he sures himself back up looking at Scott. ""So, what? I mean, how do we make sure? I mean, do we get Dr Gray to run tests?"" There's so much more he wants to say, but he is fearful that Scott isn't his brother, and he's really bottled up.

""I'm sure that Dr. Grey could run that test, all she'd need would be a blood sample.  I've no idea how busy she is right now though so it might be a few weeks before anything is known for all I know,"" Scott says, shrugging his shoulders slightly.  He doesn't talk to Jean often enough to know what her schedule is like anymore. ""Unfortunately real tests aren't always so quick and simple as they make them out to be on CSI."" Scott says with a twitch of a smile.

""So, looks like you ended up in a pretty good place."" Alex notes, glancing around at the surroundings and opening it up for Scott to share a little history.

A slow moment before Scott takes a step back to lean against the bench behind him, watching Alex. Hands slide into khaki pockets and his shoulders shrug, ""Xavier's is home now, has been for a while.""  A bell rings off in the distance and Scott's attention turns to it, ""Next class starts in like five minutes, so we'll have to continue later,"" Scott says, moving back to the bench where he was grading papers, pulling the incomplete one aside, turning the ones yet to be looked at to landscape and putting the others on top that are done in a portrait manner, with the incomplete one on top of all. ""You have a card or something? we could talk over e-mail and such.""

Alex shakes his head, ""Nah, but here."" and he pulls out a post-it where something has been scribbled on it, rips it in half and closes on the desk that Scott is utilizing. He looks for an obvious pen and takes to write. He scribbles down a phone number and email <Alex.Masters@emerson.edu> He comments, ""I teach Geophysics at Emerson, in Queens. Just started there this semester."" - There's an apparent discheveled feel to the tearing of paper, jotting down, not being prepared with pen. 

Those things are exchanged, Alex seems reticent to leave, but then on the other foot he's ready to go. This has been a very emotional moment for him and he wants to hug his brother, shake his hand, or something, but instead, he will opt to escape to collect his feelings and continue communication in another fashion.

11/16/2007

=NYC= IHOP - Queens

IHOP is more friendly than classy, but anyone who looks for class in an IHOP . . . well. It has seen better days. If the booths are more rubbery than soft, the tables more rickety than steady, and occasionally a patron knocks one entirely over, if the carpet is sort of a puced out green . . . the servers are enthusiastic and the pancakes are still pancakey and that is all that matters.

The tinkle of the tiny bell above the front door of the IHOP is enough to drive anyone working there insane, as it's been jingling all morning long without pause for rest or respite. Sure, tip money is great and all, but the wait is out the door! Which is why when it tingles once again, few if any even look up. Two men, mid twenties, perhaps, come stepping through. Because of the packedness of the resteraunt they pause there in the doorway, which is when the voice piques up. ""Hey, do you mind? Some of us are trying to get through!"" Being in New York, these sounds should be common. And they are. What's surprising is the little thing with the balls to utter them. Nadia, all five foot three of her, comes wiggling between them. She glares at the men once through and just shakes her dark hair out, moving to the counter. There are two available seats at the counter, and she's not waiting for anyone. She slides her little butt up onto the corner one and slaps the table a bit. ""Menu, please?"" She asks the question a little exasperated. The waitress doesn't seem to appreciate it and one thought can be seen running through said waitress' mind: she'd best tip well.

Already there, Alex Masters has been sitting at the counter for just a few minutes holding  a menu of his own. He closes it as the young woman is taking a seat next to him requesting a menu, then in a partial turn, mostly of his neck, he offers his, ""Better take mine, it's really slow going this mornin."". 

Simply dressed, Alex Masters wears a brown leather jacket on top of some green cotton shirt, jeans and hiking boots. His hair is a mess of early 90's though his face wears few lines, so perhaps late 20's. 

Nadia glances over from where she's had her head perched on her knuckles. Her own attire? Simple denim jeans with a sweater that reveals a flash of midrift as she moves, of course a jacket to go over it. A floppy hat has been uncerimoniously dumped on her head. ""Oh, thanks. Yeah what the hell, right? You'd think somebody was giving out free liquor up in here."" For as rude as she proved herself to be in the first ten seconds, apparently she's not below saying thank you as she takes the menu and flips it open.

With a slight grin, Alex places his elbow on the counter leaning slightly forward and shifting his seat, perhaps he's been sitting here for some time and it's getting numb. Then he notes with a nod, ""It's normally busy, but I think they're short one or two servers."" He then looks over his shoulder back at the line and the room, ""Yep, and it's just gonna get worse. I'm Alex by the way, figure we may as well get acquainted, we're here for the long haul.""

Nadia  glances over her shoulder as well, if for no other reason than to repeat his motion. She spies to two men that she had to claw her way through earlier. They spy her. She sneers, and then she turns back to the conversation at hand. ""Nadia. You think we're really gonna be here for that long? Uber suckage."" She sighs, letting her chin slump to her knuckles once more.

His head turns, capturing her gaze and then to infer her to look, his chin slightly raises looking across to her left and toward an older man in his 70's. Alex notes, ""When he came in, he still had his teeth."" Thus offering a half smile making a joke.

Nadia she doesn't smile, but at the same time she seems to appreciate the joke. Still, ""I'd knock his teeth out if it'd get me my shit any faster."" She orders some...chocolate milk, yes, and belgium waffles, and then the waitress is gone, probobly for a good, long time. As such, Nadia pushes her fists on the counter and scoots her little butt back to sit comfortable in the swivle chair. 

When Nadia gained the server's attention, he too ordered the standard breakfast sampler. After those few moments, Alex then asks, ""You go to school around here?"" just making casual conversation. - One may note a book to the right of his flatware, entitled, 'Bandera Volcano'.

Apparently the girl doesn't notice it. But then if he knew Nadia, or rather, if he knew most sixteen year old girls, that's not much of a surprise. ""Yeah, I go to Flushing High."" The name is accompanied with a roll of her eyes. Then again, that should be of little surprise. ""It definatly sucks. Though you look a little old for high school anyway.""

There's a grin and half chuckle, ""Yeah, just a little. I teach at Emerson. Geophysics. When do you graduate?"" Alex asks while glancing across to the kitchen window and seeing how much is going on up there.

Nadia can't help but blink. A deep blink. Twice. ""Geo-huh?"" She asks, shaking her head a bit. ""2010 if things go well, might have to get a little lucky on that though."" She gets her chocolate milk, and takes an almost childlike slurp of it. ""We'll just have to cross our fingers and see. I certaintly ain't ready for college, though, if I don't even know what the subjects are about.""

In slight reflection, Alex considers the date 2010, something he's probably never even thought of in the terms of graduation, though it's really just right around the corner. ""Yeah, no rush on all that, enjoy where you are now cause 2010 is gonna come faster than you think. So you having trouble in school?""

Nadia shrugs. ""I guess I wouldn't call it trouble. I mean you have to actually do most of the stuff to have trouble with it, right?"" SHe shrugs, and yes, she blows bubbles in her milk for a second before drinking another sip. ""I just don't care about it.""

With a brief 'Ah' and a nod Alex sees what she's talking about. He's got several students like that in his classes. So he leaves well enough alone and remains quiet for a moment or two. Then looks around the room at all the crowd.

Nadia doesn't stop talking. ""Yeah I know. You're a teacher, and I'm a bad student. Talk about the uberness of akward."" She drinks her milk agian. ""But seriously, why should I care? When is someone going to wlak up to me and say, 'Medizowigan, have the hypotonuse of this triangle on my desk by monday?' Let's go with like....umm....nobody. /Ever/.""

Briefly he chuckles then Alex says, ""Well, you'd be surprised. Just the other day I was on a train and the conductor came up to me and asked, 'The train is currently traveling at 35 miles per hour, another train 8 miles away, heading straight for us is traveling at 45 miles per hour. The station is only 3 miles away. Will we reach it before the other train?""

As the milk glass is pulled away from her lips, Nadia has enough sense to lick away the chocolately musache before answering. ""See, I woulda just kicked him in the  balls and asked him why he was bothering me with shit he was supposed to know. It's not my job to know how fast the train is getting there, so long as it gets me there.""

All smiles, Alex adds, ""Of course. And don't think me lecturing because I'm a teacher, but in the real world, sometimes you need to know how to figure something out and though it may never be the hypotonuse of a triangle, that exercise it just teaching you logic and clear thinking. But yeah, no worries, we sometimes end up in places where clear thinking doesn't even matter.""

Nadia shrugs, slurping up the last of the milk all loud and annoyinglike. Is she sixteen or six?! ""What could I need to figure out with like, math though? I can add, subtract, hell I can divide if you put a gun to my head."" That's an interesting mental picture. ""I can carry a calculator in my purse otherwise.""

Alex just starts in with story time, ""So a few years back I was down in Australia, Ayres Rock. It was your standard geological survey. I was having to calculate the weight of a particular stone. Sure, I had a calculator, rarely go anywhere without one. But to figure out the weight of this stone I had to measure height, width, length and then know the relative density and mass of the object. Then put it all into the forumula and do the calculation. This may not be at all what you will ever do. But depending on your future career choice, you may want to be ready, just in case you choose to do something that requires numbers. Heck, you could be the next Hawking and not even realize it because you're ignoring the numbers.""

Nadia just kinda stares. ""WHy the hell would I be measuring rocks or anything else with numbers if I hate them? I don't ignore them. I'm concious enough to know that i hate 'em, but still. I hate 'em. Don' get me wrong, I'm not that fond of reading either. I'm justnot really a school kind of person.""

""And that's totally your choice. I guess being an educator I'm sort of implying that no matter what future you have, you may want to be prepared for it. But heck, you make make a choice that won't ever require you to have to read or do math ever again."", Alex wonders to himself what that may be, street urchin, trophy wife, beauty contestant, professional cheerleader, stripper.

Nadia grins. ""See, you're just like my mom. You're missing the point. I /can/ read, I just don't like to. And I /can/ do math, I just choose not to."" Because it's boring. And stupid. ""Besides, there are other thngs in life besides school.""

""Wow, I just got compared to a mom."" Alex shakes his head grinning, ""I totally need to get out of this education racket. I think I liked myself better when I was digging in the dirt. Though, you're totally right. I think you'd make a great bodyguard. I can see it, going around playing roshambo with big guys like your two friends over there.""

Now Alex hasn't gotten a shit-eaters grin out of this girl. She's pleased. Very pleased. ""Aw, they ain' so big."" She says, glancing around to find the two men from earlier. ""Coulda fucked them up if I'd wanted to. Didn't want to make a scene and all.""

Alex glances toward those guys and then back at her, ""Totally. Your kung fu is stronger than theirs."" He's not really being serious, but it's fun because she's such a petite little girl and who knows, she may totally have a surprise.

""Come on, straight kick in the balls and they all go down. Wanna see?"" Is she playing? She pushes to her feet, standing, as if ready to go chase down the men and make a statement. Good god she's short. 

There's an 'uh' that escapes Alex's throat and he says, ""Actually Nadia, I think they learned their lesson, you know, I can tell. They probably want nothing more to do with you.""

That eat shit grin remains, and so does Nadia. Standing, that is. She laughs a little and shakes her head. ""I need to run to the ladies rom, don't let someone take my seat okay?"" And withthat she turns and starts to elbow her way through the crowd.

Nadia returns from the loo to find her food's been placed out at her seat. ""Oh, neato."" She chimes, settling in and grabbing the nearest utensil. ""Didn't spit in it or anything did you?"" She asks of Alex. It's hard to tell if she's beign serious.

He grins, having his own food in front of him and partially eaten. ""Now if I'd done that, would I tell you?"" asks Alex.

Nadia takes a bite, dribbling strawberry all over her chin. ""I'd like to think you would. But then again, if this is your spit, it tastes really fucking awesome."" She continues to eat, slurping her new chocolate milk again.

After having the last of his bacon, Alex gives himself time to chew and then drink some of the OJ. ""Anyway."" listing as if to change the subject, ""If you're ever in the neighborhood of Emerson, you should stop by, I'm in the Geology department, not hard to miss.""

Now the girl can't help but laugh, finally wiping down her chin. ""I dunno why I'd ever be there. THink they'd take one look at me and kick me right out."" 

Glancing her over he smiles, ""Little young, but I'd imagin there's nothing any different about you than the rest of the student body. Some of them like school, some don't. But there are some really great parties."" Alex thenpushes himself off the stool and pulls out his wallet. 

Nadia spins her chair so her back is to her counter and the food and she can face the man. ""Well if you're inviting me to a party I'm all in for that."" She says happily. She loves parties. Loves 'em!

""Sorry, didn't mean to imply that. More like members of the student body are always having parties. It's the college thing to do. Perhaps an added perk to actually being in college. Believe me, I've had my share in the 8 or so years I was in."" Alex makes quick note correcting any potential legal action of the statutory type.

There's no such thing as statutory drinking! ""Well now I might actually get myself in there. Hook myself up in the party scene."" Skip the classes, go to the parties. Sounds pretty much perfect. ""Don't worry, I won't tell anyone a teacher was the one who hinted to me about the booziing.""

With a grin, he nods, ""Thanks."" then after Alex puts money down on the bill, he notes, ""Take care of yourself, and no playing roshambo with the locals, unless they diserve it.""

Nadia grins. ""Well most of 'em deserve it. I'll see ya round, teach."" She says, swinging her chair back foreward to bury her tiny face in unhealthy breakfast food.

And with that, Alex departs the crowded restaurant to go teach.

<LJ-CUT TEXT=""'Read On' [Remy, Alex]"">

11/12/2007

It's early in the afternoon of a Monday holiday, and what better way to spend it then playing pool and drinking. Remy is doing both. His red eyes aren't hidden for once in public. He leans over the pool table to take a shot, an open beer sitting on a wide railing nearby. The club thumps to the beat of something metallic and techno-y. There is a clack of balls as Remy makes his shot.

Walking in off the street, Alex Masters seems to remember some girl somewhere telling him that he should come to this place. And of course, if a girl says so, it's got to be true. Regardless, walking in he gives the place the once over and realizes it may be a little too heavy of an experiment for him on this Monday afternoon, noise, techno/metal. But it's then he notices the pool tables and realizes that is something he's not done in some time, therefore, why the hell not. Then, having direction, Alex crosses to that part of the room and will scope out who's playing what and where, just to get a feel for a pick up game.

A few people walk by, scoping out Alex. As some people dance it becomes evident there is more than meets the eye.  Remy merely leans over the table to take his final shot, winning without expending too much effort.  He stands straight and grabs his beer. He then takes a long sip, holding the pool cue in his other hand, red eyes landing squarely on the approaching Alex.

It takes a moment for Alex to register the eyes. That combined with the evident dancing, he sort of begins to put things together and somewhere in his head he's saying 'oh crap'. But for now he walks around the other side of the table from Remy and asks, ""Can I drop in?"", in reference to playing.

Remy watches Alex cautiously. ""Sure, I won so it's still my table,"" he offers. Remy takes another sip of his beer as he gives Alex a once over. He moves out of the way so that Alex can easily reach the wall of cues.

His hiking boots combined with jeans and a flannel shirt sort of lend to Alex being a guy not really from the city. He dresses very casual and while taking off a worn brown leather jacket, he puts it to the side while grabbing a cue. Finding one that looks suitablly straight, he pulls it from the wall with one hand while the other moves through his hair, mussing it some while scratching his scalp. ""Name's Alex."" he offers making eye contact once again just before sitting the heel of the cue on the floor.

Remy is clad in blue jeans with rips in the knees, black leather boots, and a tight black tee shirt. A trench coat is thrown over the side of a nearby stool. Remy leans his cue against the railing, and puts his beer on the railing to start reracking the balls. ""Nice t'meet you Alex. I'm Remy,"" he says in a thick Cajun accent. Red eyes focus as he carefully places the balls in, solid, stripe, solid, strip, 8 in the middle, before he tightens them up in line with the dot. ""So what brings you here?"" he asks, still too Southernly polite for his own good.

""Lookin for a place to relax and play some pool."" Alex notes off the cuff while rolling the stick in his hands and checking for warp. ""Guessin this ain't the typical borough pub."", is said with a glance over to the floor for recognition.

Remy lifts an eyebrow at Alex and smiles. ""Not in my experience. Only been here a few times m'self though,"" he states, lifting the rack, and replacing it. ""Want to break?"" he asks Alex, moving around to reclaim his cue and beer. ""But it does have a nice table. Couple of de other bars around have tables dat are tilted or warped a bit.""

With a slight wave of the hand, ""Your table, you break."", thus returning the offer back and standing a few feet from the downtown left corner. ""They make the good ones out of marble or limestone."" Alex adds, tossing a little geology in there.

Remy nods briefly, beer sadly returned to its lonely spot.  Remy takes the cue ball and walks around the table, setting it up, then lining up his shot. A loud clack, and balls start to move around the table, a striped one managing to go into one of the pockets. ""Well, wood does warp,"" Remy states, looking back at Alex.

""Where you from?"" Alex asks noting the stripe going into a pocket and moving slightly to avoid any crossing or poor location. ""That's a mean accent you've got there.""

""From N'awleans,"" Remy says with a shrug before smirking at Alex. ""And here I thought you were de one with de accent."" Remy moves back around the table, lining up another shot, but the green striped ball just doesn't want to go in, instead hitting the side of the table, and keeping it's freedom. ""Your shot."" 

Glancing across the room at those that would stand out, Alex wonders how people can be so overt with their abilities when there's such a hatred going on in the world. Then back to Remy as he comments and notices the shot. ""Yeah, guess the surfer does come out every now and again."" - Walking around, he looks for a shot, eyeing the table and then spies a longshot solid. He lines up and hesitates, but feels like it's time to get over his own issues, especially since he's found a place like this. ""Guess it's time our kind has a haven; least a place to go where we won't be harassed.""

Remy gives Alex a bit of a look. ""Our kind. I take it dat you have some... special tricks up your sleeve?"" he says, not quiting saying, 'Hey are you a mutant too?' ""I found dis place a week or two ago, seemed kind of open t'me, den I talked to a bartender. Told me dis place is secure, why everyone is so open. Nice t'be out in public widout contacts dat's for sure. Can't remember de last time I was."" It certainly wasn't this decade. 

Taking the shot, and missing, Alex watches the two wayward balls bounce off bumpers and back into the fray of orbs. ""Secure, only as sofar as no one sees you coming and going. Sorta like that mutant place up in Westchester, I'm sure the gates, like this place's door is monitored by the Feds."" Though he doesn't give in that he too is special, he doesn't deny it either. Alex is going through a transition in his life, it's time to quit being such a pussy.

Remy doesn't move to take his shot quite yet. ""Mutant place up in Westchester?"" he asks curiously. Seems while he has read enough of the news to know some events in New York in the recent past, he never read anything anywhere about a school. Then his eyes narrow. ""Feds? I remember reading something about stuff going on by the park back before I moved here, but nothing about a school."" 

""Xaviers. It was outted a while back as a mutant school. Cool place, good for young mutants who need help with their abilities."" Alex makes note while holding onto his cue, butt to the floor, back from the table a bit. 

Remy leans over the table, starting to line up a shot, before deciding to change position and try a different line up. ""I did not know dat. Probably missed it somehow,"" he states, shrugging a little before taking his shot. Clack, clack, clack, and a ball slowly rolls to the edge of a pocket, wobbling before deciding to stay on the table. Someone is holding back. ""I can imagine dat would be useful for kids though. Training and such. Some are luckier den others when it comes to what dey can do.""

""And then some of us just wake up one day and realize something is completely wrong and have to adapt to survive. Guess like your contacts."" Alex notes adding to the story woven by Remy, ""But yeah, I've got a talent. Little easier to hide I guess.""""

Remy smiles. ""Yes well. Red eyes is a little obvious when I'm born, forget something happening when I'm a teenager,"" he says, looking at Alex curiously. ""So what can you do, if you don't mind me asking?""

""Plasma."", a single word is shared but can say a lot to the right ears while he walks around the table looking for a shot, somewhat afraid to knock the teetering ball in. So he avoids that end of the table while he lines up.

Remy seems to think about it a minute. ""Like Star Trek?"" he asks curiously, trying t see if he follows Alex. He makes his way back to his beer, picking it up and sipping it as he watches Alex lining up his shot.

There's a grin as he shoots and knocks a solid straight in recoiling the cue ball in a backwards spin a few inches to have another shot. ""I guess that's a good reference point."", Alex lists putting the plasma question in context. Lining up the second shot, ""I hadn't realized though that there were so many of us.... first the Xavier place, now this.""

Remy chuckles. ""Well maybe it's like being left handed. Over time de population increases as it becomes socially acceptable. Or sadly, black or gay as well,"" he states, shaking his head. ""If people put as much effort into helping people as dey did into hating dem, we wouldn't be in such a mess."" 

Shooting, he scratches, both balls go in seperate pockets. Alex stands up and backs away allowing Remy to take the cue ball and place it where he desires. ""Hatred... it's what makes the world go around. That and greed. So how about you? Aside from the eyes.""

Remy smiles at Alex as he picks up the cue ball, setting it on the table to line up a multiball shot. Cue reaches around the table as Remy doublechecks himself. ""Just the eyes,"" he says, lying for now with a straight face. He takes the shot, the ball at the edge of the pocket gets bumped in, in passing, and another ball gets hit, bouncing off one side, before rolling in a premeditated manner to the corner pocket... then swoosh into the pocket. ""Hatred does seem to be de currency of today.""

""Nice shot."" Alex says watching the combination. And stepping away to another side allowing Remy to migrate as he would. He also have a feeling that regardless of how good he plays, he knows he won't stand a chance against Remy.  There's a waitress, Alex notes to her, ""Bottle of Lite."" then asks, ""Remy, you want anything?""

Remy shakes his head, using his cue to point to his half empty bottle. ""I'm still good, but danks for asking,"" he says.  Remy leans down to take another shot, once again leaving a ball on the edge, almost toying with Alex as they play, or perhaps giving him a chance.

He's being herded, but he doesn't mind, he's just here for the relaxation and conversation. ""What's your field?"" asking about a job, after Alex let the waitress go to get his order and glancing across the room at those who dance once again.

Remy leans against the railing. ""Nothing special. Just do manual sorts of stuff,"" he states, not going into much detail. ""It pays de bills. You?"" he asks, letting his gaze go to the dancers as well, people watching during Alex's turn.

""Geophysics. I teach."" Alex answers in kind while lining up another shot. That shot will go awry in the next few seconds, knocking the teetering ball within the pocket. ""Free gift."" 

""Geophysics, sounds fancy,"" Remy says with a smile. ""Way above my head probably."" If Remy had half the desire to learn as he did to gamble, he'd be an amazing mathematician with his gift for numbers and probabilities and problem solving. ""Danks, I didn't really need it though.""  Remy moves back to the table, and purposely lines up a shot that not only scraches but puts one of Alex's balls in the pocket as well.

There's a grin, ""Oh I didn't imagine you did."", Alex says knowingly. Then walks around after the shot is taken and takes the cue from the scratched pocket. ""Yeah, Pool was never my game. Now Lawn Darts, that's where I really excell.""

Remy grins, going back to the railing. ""Lawn Darts? I don't think I've ever heard of dat game,"" he admits, looking at the table carefully. He retrieves his beer and takes another slow sip.

""It was outlawed in 43 states because kids were stabbing one another at range."" Alex chuckles, but he's telling a sad truth. There's a shot, a ball made, another shot, and a ball missed. The waitress returns, there's money exchanged for beer, and Alex notes, ""Think I ran into a girl that works here, but can never remember club names.""

Remy laughs. ""Sounds like my kind of game den,"" he says. As the waitress returns Remy gives her the once over and a charming smile, before his attention returns to Alex. ""I actually got to talk to one of de bartenders de other night. Seemed pretty cool to me. Pleasant. Polaris I think she said her name was.""

""Polaris, that's a unique name. But not the name I'm thinking. Lori... amazing green hair."" Alex adds, obviously talking about the same person, but not knowing it.

Remy lifts an eyebrow at Alex curiously. ""Well, de girl I'm talking about had green hair. Green lipstick too. Said she was born with de hair, kinda like my eyes,"" he says. ""She was explaining to me how dis place is safe.""

Suddenly it comes clear, Alex notes, ""Yeah.... wow, her. Polaris huh, guess that's her stage name."" Not really having the vocabulary to say /code name/. ""Guess there aren't to many people with green hair.""

Remy offers a shrug. ""Well, dis is New York. I have seen other people walking around with green hair,"" he says. ""But I'm not sure dat it matters in dis case, so her name is Lori huh? I'll have t'keep dat in mind. Had fun tossing out north star lines to her though. She was a good sport."" 

After a chuckle, Alex says, ""Well, you're smoother than I am, I had a feeling I sort of pissed in her Wheaties by the time we were done exchanging hellos."" - He clears from the table, giving Remy the room he needs for what ever shot he's about to take. And finds humor in all of this.

Remy laughs. ""Yeah. I've met a few girls like that.  There's this one I've run into a few times. Seems like no matter what I say I piss her off, so at dis point I push her buttons for kicks,"" he says with a grin. He can be such an ass sometimes. Remy moves around the table, and takes a shot, easily getting his last ball in. Then he gives Alex a smirk, and points to the pocket that looks like the worst shot to get the eight ball in without scratching.

Alex knows that Remy's about to put the ball in, no question. He just stands back and watches while he comments, ""Bro, that's harsh, and rocks all at once. I ran into this chick in the elevator the other day. Turns out the elevator froze up. So I was gonna get us out of there... The chick flipped out.. I mean went all psycho about the elevator falling and killing us if I jacked with anything."" He pauses to reflect and take a drink. ""There was something totally hot about it.""

Remy laughs. ""Yeah. I mean, she seems nice enough honestly. And I even pointed out she'd look really nice if she smiled once in a while. Boy did dat go up sideways,"" he says, shaking her head. ""Even refused to tell me her name, but eventually I ran into her wid a guy who lives in my building and found out her name was Natalie. But if she's going to insult everything dat comes out of my mouth I might as well bark back,"" he says. He falls silent as he lines up the shot then the eight ball hits one wall at an acute angle, hits another for an obtuse angle, teeters on the edge of the pocket, and rolls in.

""Natalie?"" Alex asks, making another connection, ""Dude, brown hair, glasses, hot when she's totally pissed off? And not even caring about the game.""

Remy nods. ""Yeah, dat sounds like her. Purposely tries not to be noticed?""

There's a laughter from Alex as they're talking about the same girls, twice in a row. ""There's no fuckin way that we're talking about the same girls, but we are.""

Remy smirks. ""Well, I'll be damned. Small world I guess,"" he says, leaning his cue against the table. ""She's definately hot, and her bark probably is worse then her bite, but I'd rather focus my energy on girls dat aren't so violently against compliments.""

Putting his cue up, he knows he's beat and won't go back for more, at least today. Alex makes note, ""Say, you wouldn't happen to know some girl named Alexis, young, maybe 21, pretty with brown hair?"" He's taking a shot in the dark, seeing a pattern and wondering how small this world really is.

Remy shakes his head. ""Sorry man, I don't. Guess third time was de charm for a girl one of us hasn't run into."" Remy seems utterly amused. ""You know a girl named Kara? Yay high, always carrying around a pad?"" He has to try one as well, motioning with his hands Kara's approximate height.

With a shake of his head, Alex grabs his jacket and starts to put it on as if he's making ready to vacate. ""Not yet, but I'm sure I'll meet her."", is said with a smile, then he queries about a second meeting of them, ""So you hang out here often?""

""Possibly, though it is a large city. But what do they say, something about five degrees of seperation?"" Remy just smiles at Alex. ""Well, I plan to now dat I've found it. See you around again sometime?"" he asks curiously, offering his hand.

There is no hesitation in taking Remy's hand, Alex has found a new venue and perhaps a new friend. His grip is strong, but not unnaturally, just that of an ordinary man. Eye contact is kept and he offers, ""Absolutely, it's good to know ya Remy.""

Remy returns the firm shake with a smile, and red eyes meeting Alex's. ""Nice to meet you, and I look forward to running into you again."" As he releases Alex's hand he goes back to the table laughing to himself. ""Stuck in an elevator with dat woman. Surprised he made it out alive. Dat one has some luck.""

There's a chuckle as he departs and a hand in waving while walking away, ""Kinda hope to run into her again. I know I'll lose a limb though.""

"event","After an interesting day of being stuck in an elevator with a panicked girl, I look back and really wonder what was up. Perhaps it was just a different viewpoint on life. I personally believe that either you act or you die. Sitting around until you die or until someone else changes your fate must have been her philosophy.

<LJ-CUT TEXT=""'Click to Read' [Natalie, Alex]"">

10/30/2007


Taking the elevator down from the top floor, Alex finds himself watching as the numbers creep downward. He stands at the back of the elevator, leaning against the wall, both hands on the rail, and looking rather casual in his hiking boots, jeans and a leather jacket over a mock turtleneck. He's perhaps stuck in the 90's. On his right shoulder is a leather backpack that is pushed to the side against the wall.

Natalie catches the elevator on the 6th - not too far to walk, when she's feeling energetic, but the pile of books in her arms discourages her from trying, and she's a bit breathless when she darts inward and spares a passing smile for the man already occupying the space. She shifts her load carefully so she can free a hand to push her glasses back on the bridge of her nose and then settles in, gaze tipped upward to the numbers overhead.

As she enters, Alex gives a half smile and a slight nod, but no sooner afterwards does he look up at the numbers which begin to pass after the doors close.
5
4
And then with a sudden jolt the elevator freezes. There's a grinding of metal and the sounds of a cable whipping to sudden tension. 
Then the silence of ascertaining what just occurred while he holds onto the rail just a second or two longer. Then he intones, ""You've got to be kidding me."" while stepping to get a better look at the control panel.

Natalie's hand whips sideways to grasp desperately at the handrail as her heart jumps aproximately to her throat. Her breath comes in in a sharp gasp as her fingers tighten against the metal, and it takes a moment for her to gain enough control over her voice to ask, ""What just happened?""

""Sounded like the emergency couplers kicked in."" Alex says while pushing the emergency call button which does not work. Then there's the emergency bell button that also does not work. He then turns back toward Natalie and says, ""With the breaks engaged, I doubt we're going to fall, they're emergency systems to prevent the car from dropping.""

""You /doubt/ that we're going to fall?"" Natalie does not, all in all, sound overly comforted as she turns to eye Alex warily.

He nods and as he opens his cell phone, ""No signal. So, we either sit and wait, or we try to pry the door open or go up through the hatch."". In his final suggestion, Alex is seen looking up at the light fixture, plastic tiles, and the hidden hatch just a few feet above.

""Go up through the--"" Natalie blinks at Alex in disbelief, and her hand tightens around that handrail just a touch more. In case they fall. Or something. ""Are you /crazy/?"" 

Looking back at the woman Alex says, ""It's okay."" he says calmly. ""What's your name?"" . He is taking the time to get her focused on something as he's realizing that she's a little tense.

How very nice of him. It doesn't appear, for the moment, to be working. ""Natalie,"" she shares, and then offers the obvious in adding, ""I'm not big on small spaces you can't get out of that might fall at any moment.""

""Natalie."" He says with an understanding smile, ""I'm Alex Masters. I teach here at the school. What do you do?"" While closing in his question, he reaches down to pick up his backpack and open it.

Natalie's brows shoot up as she eyes Alex, although she does deign to loosen her death grip on the rail just a touch. ""We're trapped in an elevator and you're making small talk?"" she wants to know. ""Aren't there other things we should be doing? An emergency telephone or something?""

From within his backpack he produces a hammer with a very sharp point on one end and a mallet head on the other, ""I tried the call button and the alarm, neither worked. Surely someone is aware that the elevator is broken, and they're on their way, but it may be best to pad our bet and start seeing about helping their rescue."" With the hammer in hand, Alex walks to the door and inserts the sharp end between the doors, but is suddenly blocked by something within.

Long before Alex reaches the door, Natalie's stepping forward to jerk at his shoulder with an insistant hand. ""Don't /touch/ that!""

Turning to her advance, and refraining from doing what Alex had intentions of doing, ""Natalie? What are you doing?""

""Are you freaking /insane/?"" Natalie wants to know. ""Seriously. Do you design elevators for a living? Do you know what will happen if you pry them open? Leave the freaking doors /alone/.""

""It's just a door."" Alex replies, ""We can probably get it open and then call for help on one of the exposed floors. I so totally saw it done on a rerun of Hawaii 5-0."" Though he doesn't turn toward the door again, seeing how tense she really is.

""Oh, well, then by /all means/, let's try it if we saw it on television!"" Natalie turns back to lean against the far wall, staring at Alex grumpily. She drops her papers to the floor and mutters, ""You teach here at the school.""

Seeing this as something she needs, Alex turns to face her from across the elevator  and leans against the angle of door/wall to address her statement, ""Yeah, I teach Geology. Started this fall. What do you do?""

""PhD?"" Natalie wants to know, eyeing Alex dubiously. /Very/ dubiously.

Letting her have control, Alex says, ""Yes, UC Berkeley Class of 01. Spent some time traveling and working for a few groups, contract mostly.""

""/Berkeley/."" That earns a laugh and a shake of her head from Natalie, and she slides down the elevator wall to settle into a sit on the floor. 

""Yeah, Berkeley. What about it?"" Alex asks seeing that she's settling down. Though he maintains his current position.

""Didn't realize they were that desperate,"" Natalie retorts.

""Ya know, I'll let that slide cause of the situation we're in."" Alex grins and has the look of restraint. 

Natalie meets that grin with a heartfelt roll of her eyes.

""So what about you, share time."" Alex requests as he too settles down in a crouched posture. Knees bent, weight on the balls of his feet and up against the wall with his back.

""Share time?"" Natalie turns her head to stare sidelong at Alex. ""What, is that like story time? Nap time?""

""It's like, you called me out, and I shared, so it's your turn. Especially since you won't let me jimmy the door."" Alex challenges in tone while he places the hammer back into his bag that has rested on the floor.

""Oh, well, forgive me for exerting a little /common freaking sense/,"" Natalie snaps in return, gaze fixed on that hammer. 

After a moment of silence, not really sure how to address this girl he notes, ""Natalie, sorry. I wasn't really looking for a fight and I'm figuring we're knee jerking.""

""To the suggestion that someone start poking around with things he doesn't know jackshit about while we're hanging four stories up in a non-working elevator?"" Natalie wants to know. ""Damn /right/ I'm kneejerking against /that/.""

I don't understand that.

""I'd rather do something than sit here and wait for the fire department to show up or the chance for it to actually give way and we fall."" Alex makes note of while standing up from his crouched position. 

""That's very big strong man of you,"" Natalie returns with a roll of her eyes. 

Alex is definitely not one to understand women one iota; and even taking the time to play nice with her and do as she asked, he's decided that he should do something else. So in his standing, he moves to the back left corner of the elevator and starts looking up through the grated tile.

""Gonna climb out through the top now?"" Natalie wonders.

""You got any better idea?"" Alex asks as he puts a foot on the railing that surrounds the midline of the elevator.

""Sit your ass down and wait for the people who know what they're doing before you manage to fall or shake the car loose?"" Natalie suggests, voice /quite/ even.

He turns back to her, looking down past his shoulder and before he starts to say something, there's another sound just outside the elevator car, a grinding of metal and then a sudden drop of the floor by about 17 inches. In this, he loses his footing and grabs the railing while going down.

Natalie , it must be said, /freaks out/. Her hands come down hard on the floor in a desperate grip and she loses her breath entirely, eyes flying wide in panic.

As the movement stops, Alex finds himself raising up off the floor. He looks over at Natalie and asks, ""You okay?""

Natalie has since closed her eyes and is concentrating very, very hard on not hyperventilating.

Alex moves over to her, staying low on the floor and says, ""Natalie, breathe, easy. Just in and out, slowly. Very slowly."" He reaches and attempts to place his right hand on her left shoulder.

""If you touch me, I will bite off your hand,"" Natalie snaps, jerking her head toward him.

Moving back, Alex says while retracting his hand and whole body, ""Easy.""

""Sit the fuck down,"" Natalie bites between clenched teeth, ""and do. Not. Touch. Anything.""

He remains seated across the elevator car from her and lets out a frustrated sigh.  But says nothing while he waits for something else to happen. Surely there are people outside that have heard this noise and or they know that the elevator is broken. Surely.

Surely. Natalie waits, eyes closed once more as she tips her head back against the cool surface of the elevator's wall.

Then there are sounds from outside, a tapping on metal with something also metalic. A voice coming through the walls asking, ""This is the <region> Fire Department, is there anyone in the elevator?""

""We'd love to get out!"" Natalie calls in return, head lowering so she can stare at the door.

Shifting, Alex calls out, ""There are two of us in here.""

Then the fire/rescue voice remarks, ""Ok, we're working on getting you out, just be patient.""

Natalie frowns, brows pulling down, and leans her head back once more. She does not speak to Alex.

Patienty he waits, moving to put his back against a wall and dragging his bag with him. Alex remains quiet for a time and then says, ""I normally take the stairs.""

Natalie does not reply. She's feeling terribly social at the moment.

Crowbars are used to pry the outer and then inner doors open. The car is mostly along the level of the 3rd floor and firefighters are ready to help those within, out. Alex says nothing about the means by which they opened the doors, he just lets it go and waits for them to evacuate Natalie first. 

Natalie does not remark on the difference between trained professionals and dubious geology professors with hammers in their backpacks. She has no problem with allowing Alex to stay in the small, metal space that might plummet at any moment. First her bag, then Natalie, disappear through the door, and she's already brushing off firefighterly attention and striding away toward the stairs before Alex can appear behind her.

There's no interest in pursuit, after he exit and the attention given to her by the firefighters, Alex moves out of the elevator and leaves well enough alone, but takes time to thank the men and will stay around if there are questions.

Anyway, the girl, she likes old movies, invited me over. I never considered to ask her age, she seems a little young. Maybe she's going to try and set me up with her mom.

<LJ-CUT TEXT=""'Click to read' [Alexis, Alex]"">


Holding onto the nape of a young man's neck, Alex Masters is seen walking the youth to a nearby counter so as to speak with a Library administrator. Alex doesn't look to pleased with the going's on, nor does the youth. Once at the counter, Alex notes to the administrator that the youth was cutting pages out of a library text (which is presented) with a razor blade. And within minutes, university security is contacted to escort the youth to a back room where the issue will be reviewed. 

Once complete, and free of his captive, Alex turns and starts walking back toward a seating area where his belongings lay.

Alexis is not a student here, but she blends in well enough. Her hair is pulled back into a ponytail and her dress is casual in jeans and a blouse that fits snuggly to her form, but is still presentable. She stands over by the bulletin board, looking through the flyers put up there until she's distracted by security coming by. Curious, her gaze follows them to where Alex and the student explain the situation. Seeing the professor makes her smile and she trots over toward him, following his path back to the seating area. ""Hello again, Professor Alex.""

Just as casual, Alex wears hiking boots, jeans, a flannel shirt of red and black that is untucked and generally 'loose' looking. Just before he takes a seat he is greeted by Alexis. He turns, smiles and says, ""Hey, it's that girl with my name, only with an 'is'. What a pleasant suprise, what brings you all the way out to Queens?""

Alexis chuckles, remaining standing. ""That's me. Oh, well I'm just looking to see if there's drama clubs that are open to non-students..maybe try and get some connection. Y'know, networking and all that. How are you?""

Motioning to the seating area, he non verbally offers a seat while he too sits, ""I'm actually pretty good. So what'd you do with your half of the money?"" Curious, Alex follows a conversation trail in regards to their last encounter.

Alexis nods and takes a seat after being invited to do so. ""Uh-"" She chuckles a little. ""Nothing as exciting as I had hoped-I think it just went toward bills. But it's all good..it saved me some money so I could by my niece some toys and my friend a yo-yo last night. And yours?""

""Spent some on food during my trip upstate, but aside from that, it's still in my wallet. How long are you in my neck of the woods for?"", Alex asks putting away a few books into his leather pack - making ready to depart the library.

Alexis shrugs, ""No specific time...I'm just pretty much hanging out until I work tonight."" She watches him pack his things idly. ""Why?""

""Almost lunch time. Figured you'd want to grab something to eat. There's this sandwich shop just off campus, pretty good, and of course I'll treat."", Alex offers a different venue aside from the standard hanging out in the library and talking just above a whisper. He stands having compiled all of his stuff into his pack.

Alexis lifts her brows, giving the man a slightly scrutinizing look before she nods. ""Sure, why not."" She stands again and waits for him. ""Lead the way.""

Walking toward the exit, and then out, Alex begins, ""So we met randomly in some cab ride, learned a lot about what each other knows, but little about one another. Tell me about your interests in drama and what you want to do with it.""

Alexis smiles, tucking her hands into her pockets as they walk. ""Well, I want to be an actress. And I know, just about every kid today wants to be one and get famous, but I /really/ do. So TV, movies, theater, whatever it takes. I've been going to some open casting calls, but no luck yet...but, I'm going to keep trying and since I know one of the theater professors here, I thought he could help me out.""

""Hey, regardless of how many other people want to do it, at least you've got the follow through and drive. Only means you're one step above the competition."" Alex notes with a compliment and then asks, ""Are you native to New York, or from somewhere else?""

Alexis looks over at him and smiles her thanks. ""New York...I've never been out of it. But you've been all kinds of places, right?""

""Pretty much. My job definitely involves travel and site seeing. But most of the places are remote and not really luxurious. Lots of the time I'm sleeping on a bed roll under the stars. Love it, but there were times when a good shower would have been great."" Alex leads across a street and just off campus where there's a place called ""Three Brothers Deli"". Lots of students in this location and it offers just what he suggested, sandwiches.

Alexis follows along into the sandwich shop. ""It sounds great to me. I mean, sure, I'd prefer a five star suite, but quiet, peaceful, under the sky...that sounds nice too. What do you do that makes you travel around like that?""

""Geologist. That's what I teach at Emerson, but this college was a random encounter that landed me a job when I didnt have one lined up. I graduated a few years back from Berkeley and ended up working a few sites with geologists and archeologists, helping them out with their digs. It was pretty cool, you know, just living in the wind."" He pauses reflecting, ""I already miss it. I probably won't last more than a year here.""

Alexis chuckles, teasing him, ""Does that make you like Indiana Jones? Professor by day, adventurer by night? And I bet all the female students fall at your feet.""

Alex chuckles and shakes his head, oblivious to it if it did exist, he denies, ""Nah, totally not as romantic as it's made out to be. Most of my days were filled with using a rock chipper to pick at the formations, looking at the land. Never chased by pigmys or had a guy stick his hand into my chest to pull out my heart."" 

After a brief pause of getting sandwiches and finding a place to sit. Alex asks, ""So aside from working down in the village, going out for casting calls, what do you do for fun?""

Alexis continues to tease him, using a horribly fake German accent, ""I think you are just being modest, Dr. Jones."" After they sit she muches on a chip. ""Um..."" That's a good question. ""Nothing really..just hang out with friends, or whatever. Nothing special.""

""Oddly, my career is my hobby. Like, rocks are fun to me, and when people ask me that question, I'm always wondering if there's more to life than rocks. I heard rumors that people go out to movies, see plays, shows, etc. But I don't think I've seen a movie in ... 7 years. I'm so out of the loop."" Alex notes and then takes a bite of a large sub. 

Alexis laughs, ""Rocks are fun?"" She echoes, quite amused. Then she stares at him a little awestruck. ""7 years? You're kidding? Okay, well, you are in severe need of a dirt-break. You should come over and hang out at my place, I've got tons of movies to catch you up. Seriously Professor, you need help.""

""Professor.... I feel there's a new nick name in there, but it makes me wonder if I'm gonna be calling you Mary Ann or Ginger."" Alex notes a tease in kind but doesn't remark about going back to her place, as it just may be friendly teasing on her part and he isn't one to push or jump right in on a potential 'hit'. 

Alexis giggles, ""Ginger of course! She's the movie star. 'Course, I'd have to dye my hair..and I'm not sure how I'd fair as a redhead."" After a bite of her food, she inquires further, ""So, what kind of movies do you like? Anything but horror, I don't like those.""

""I like old movies... you know, the sort that has 'va va voom' in them between dance numbers with Carey Grant and Katherine Hepburn. 'Bringing up Baby' is my all time favorite of that era. I'm not really big on all this CGI stuff with explosions and the lack of acting skills."" Alex answers reflecting to a time when running across a field with an actual airplane behind was how they did it instead of using blue screens and computer graphics.

Alexis smiles brightly, ""Oh my gosh, me too! Old movies are my favorite, with musicals a close second. Well, now you just /have/ to come over. No one else I know is into that stuff.""

Alex now sees she's serious with the whole 'movie watching' aspect which is a casual way of saying she's interested in getting to know him. At least that's his translation. He smiles and says, ""I think I just may take you up on that."" - Though, he could also show up and she have friends there that she's trying to set him up with, girls are still a mystery. He leaves it open, to feel her out and sees where she may continue. ""Just not to much Spencer Tracy, I can only take so much of him.""

Alexis chuckles. ""Alright. I'll go through my collection and pick out the best, then you can pick what you want to watch."" She nibbles another patoto chip. ""So, when are you off?""

""Off?"", Alex asks thinking of taking off to another dig site, then realizes she means off work, not something he's acostomed to being asked, ""Oh, off work."" he notes then follows with. ""I just teach in the mornings, not doing reasearch currently and labs are handled by the TA's. So anytime after noon I'm free.""

Alexis nods, ""Cool. Hmmm, I don't have any paper on me...do you? I can write you down my number and address."" She offers, licking a bit of mayo from her finger so that if he has a pen, it won't get messy. 

Having brought his pack, Alex pulls out a small spiral and pen. He slides it across and says, ""You thinking this week or next?"" asking just following up on the idea.

Alexis takes the pen and writes down her name, phone number and address on it before sliding it back over. ""Um, whenever really. This week is fine with me."" Not a slow mover, this one. ""How about friday?""

""Friday sounds good."" Alex notes taking the slid over pad. His eyes linger a moment more before shifting to the pad and then taking it to stuff within his pack.

And with that, connections and plans are made. Lunch covers other recent topics such as current events and her pursuit of acting. He doesn't know anyone in the region that caiters to that dream, but he's sure there are people on campus who can help. The drama department can be her friend. Soon, lunch will pass and the two will move on their seperate ways.

"event","Of this misadventure, today's encounter with a girl named Rahne has been the most... Just a girl that it'd be nice to run into again.

<LJ-CUT TEXT=""'Click to read.' [Rahne, Alex]"">


To his left, upon a small table, there is a cup of tea. That is the focus of his attention. Alex Masters leans toward the table while sitting in a comfortable padded wooden chair. His right hand dabbles with the spoon, stirring the liquid within. Upon his form, he wears hiking boots, jeans, a medium blue tshirt and a light colored sport coat. His hair is early 90's discheveled and he appears bored.

With the morning advanced enough that the majority of students have successfully been coralled into classes, Rahne is in search of a few moments to recover from waking up early enough to help in that task. The young woman, still a teenager herself, pushes the door to the room open with one hand and rubs the other through her spikey red hair. ""Och, I swear, they're goin' to drive me grey before..."" Her mutters are aborted as she realizes she is not alone in the room. She eyes Alex with all of the territorial skepticism that she can muster at the moment. ""Hello there.""

With her entry, Alex is taken away from his deep thoughts about tea with or without sugar, and just turning his head to notice the new arrival. It takes a second for him, as he made it a point today to arrive at the school extra earlty in hopes of finding his appointment. And within that second he blinks clearing his eyes and focus. Straightning up, he says, ""Hey.. lemmie guess, you're here to tell me that Dr Grey won't have time to see me today?""

A hand is raised and Rahne waves the palm at him, dismissing the assumption. ""Och, no, I'm far more like to demand you tell me if there is more tea somewhere."" She looks back toward the door for a moment, then her attention is returned to the apparent visitor. ""I haven't seen Je-- Dr. Grey yet this morning. Did you want me to go see if I can hunt her down?""

""Nah, I'm good. She knows I'm here, it's just a matter of time."" He reaches down onto the floor next to him, just out of sight due to other furniture fixtures and lifts a tray - upon which is a pot, cup/saucer, milk, and sugar. ""If you want some, it's all yours. I'm tea'd out. What's your name?""

""Where are my manners?"" She immediately brushes a palm against the leg of her jeans and offers it out toward him. ""I'm Rahne Sinclair. I'm sorry for acting a bit strange, I've been dragging kids about by their scruffs since seven or so this morning."" Rahne does her best at a smile, but considering the occuption she just shared, it is maybe a tad weary.

Standing, he places the tray on a nearby table and takes Rahne's hand, ""Alex Masters."" He introduces himself in kind and follows with, ""That's a great name you've got, right along with an accent, Scottish?""

""A pleasure, Mister Masters,"" she says, her smile warming a tad at the compliment. ""That's right, aye. I'm on loan for the time bein' to the school here."" Rahne eyes the tray for a moment before caving in and attacking it to procure a cup of the tea for herself.

After her break toward the tray, he takes a slight step back, giving her space and corrects, ""Alex, please, just as long as I get to use Rahne."" There's some favor in his tone, perhaps he's attracted to this girl who is far too young for him, and he knows it, but he's just a guy afterall. He then he sures up his statement with, ""Where in Scotland are you on loan from? I take it you're not a student here?""

""Alex it is then,"" Rahne affirms, but only after the first sip of tea. ""Originally, I was raised in Kinross-shire, but I've been living for years at my mum's institute at Muir Isle."" She chuckles lightly, a fond smile at this part of the tale, ""My mum's Dr. MacTaggert, that's how the school's managed to get me loaned to them. Enough of me, though. What brings you to our merry little madhouse this morning?"" 

""Dr MacTaggert, wow."" He recognizes the name, especially in light of his recent research into mutant affairs.  He motions to a nearby seat that would fall opposite to the one that he stands in front of. ""It's a long story, but I'll be brief. Join me?"" He maintains eye contact, watching, interested and curious. He's really easy to read.

""I notice you didn't leap behind a chair. I imagine that means you've yet to meet Mum?"" Her smile is broad and playful at that, but she nods her head and takes the seat she's gestured to, looking across at Alex. ""I'm not afraid of a long story, it'll keep me from a chore or two.""

""Not met your mom, but I'll be glad to keep you from your chores."" He says with a glit and smile as he takes a seat after she does. ""So, a month ago I was in Peru, I'm a geologist, working on a dig and got a call from a collegue about some tectonic activity going on up here. I was excited, jumped on the first flight I could muster. Well, after some investigation, I discovered it was mutant activity, not tectonic... rather, a mutant that could cause earthquakes."" He pauses a moment, mid way through his story, so as to give her space to interject if she wishes.

Oddly, the thought of a mutant who causes earthquakes brings a smile to Rahne. ""Ah, aye, I know one of that brand myself, actually."" She nods her head before taking another sip of tea, flagging that her interjection is done.

""Well, with no new projects on the horizon, I stumbled upon a job teaching at Emerson, got a place, decided to live in the city. Which sort of brings me to why I'm here. I've got an ability that I'm hoping Jean can help me control, get rid of, suppress, or just get it to where it doesn't require constant babysitting."" Alex notes with a regretful tone about his power. 

""I hate to burst your bubble,"" Rahne says, a little gently. ""But I don't think there is much hope for being rid of a mutation. Controlling, though, that is a piece of what this place is about,"" she explains, with a wave of a hand meant to encompass the entire school.

""Yeah, that's what I've been told. Oh well."" Alex is not inclined to want to dwell on that subject, he'd rather learn about her, ""So you teach here then?""

Rahne shakes her head, ""Oh, nah. I'm a bit young for that. I'm playing sort of assistant RA for the girls and a lab assistant for Dr. Grey and Dr. McCoy."" Her smile is a little smirky over the rim of her teacup. ""Between the two of them, they keep me busy.""

""So then college? When you're not working, or do they just occupy all of your time?"" Alex asks nodding and having sit back and slightly to the right in the chair he occupies. Leaning on his elbow  a bit.

A little shake of her spikey head accompanies Rahne's chuckle. ""This is mum's idea of a practical education before I settle on a career path."" She adds, ""It might also be trying to crowbar me into followin' her footsteps.""

""I'm sure, if you wanted, you could and more."" Referring to her following in those footsteps. He's got a clear image that she's not high school level though, so he's slightly relieved that his interest isn't along the lines of legal trouble.  He then adds, ""I graduated UC Berkeley a few years back, did a lot of traveling, even did some time in Ireland, west coast. Very interesting rock formations out there.""

Rahne produces another of those little chuckles, her cheeks reddened a hint at the compliments. ""I'm afraid I'm fairly clueless when it comes to geology. I don't think I would know an interesting rock from well, an uninteresting rock."" She looks fairly helpless with that horrible statement.

""Eah, it was one of the easier sciences. There's only three types that every rock falls into. Then it's just a matter of looking at the planet as one big rock slide, and well, there ya go."" Alex says with light tone and smile. Then he asks, ""So, I'm not all up on my mutant etiquette, is it allowed to ask what another person's talent it, or is that taboo?""

Rahne smiles as she nods her head to Alex's summary of geology. ""I have an odd perspective on the planet. Strange brain of mine, so I suppose that works."" Then she arches up a red brow. Her smile turns more encouraging, ""I don't think there is much of a rule laid down, really. If you're curious ask. I think I figure that if you're sitting in the living room of this house, there's no harm to be found in talking about it with you.""

A little relieved with the positive response of his tiptoeing around mutant subjects. ""I've just never been in such a place where such things are spoken of... but while we're on the topic, what is yours?"" Alex asks leaning slightly forward with a softer voice.

Rahne is not so much into tip-toeing. She shrugs her shoulders and says the following as if it were the most casual piece of conversation to be found. ""Basically? I'm a werewolf.""

There's a slight moment of reflection there as Alex furrows his brow reaching to visualize this. He's obviously not been exposed to to much in the mutation realm and tilting his head slightly to the side he asks, ""So, you transform into a wolf? That's, amazing."" He's actually impressed with the thoughts of it.

""Aye, I do,"" Rahne confirms. There is a sip of her tea that serves perhaps only to be ironic considering the fact she has just shared. ""There is a wee more to it than that, but that's the gist of it."" She looks to Alex, with an upward lift of her brows and a nod of her head. ""Your turn,"" she encourages.

Pulled from his imagery, Alex smiles and ""Oh, yeah, well from what I can tell. I absorb ambient energy and convert it to what I think is plasma, then project it. Not so interesting, I'd guess."" 

""Plasma?"" She asks, then she nods her head. ""I suppose I can see why you're knockin' on Dr. Grey's door then."" Rahne smiles, an understanding little expression over her tea. ""I don't think you could be at a better place, if you're looking for help with control.""

""Yeah, it gets a little out there sometimes."" Alex refers to the lack of control. ""This is a really interesting place. And very unique in light of the States' arguments against Mutant rights. Actually, I'm kinda glad it's here, giving all these young people a chance.""

Rahne certainly seems to agree to that. She does so with quite a conviction, ""These are good kids here. Right now, they might not be at their best, with the accident last week and all, but they're good kids. They deserve that chance and I am glad to be able to help give it to them, the same way Mum gave me my chance.""

""Your mom gave you a chance? Not sure I follow, seems like being one of the foremost authorities on mutations, there'd be no question there."" Alex queries about the irregular notation.

""She adopted me when I was a bit younger than these kids,"" Rahne explains. She leans back a tad in her chair, crossing her legs before leaning forward to rest elbows on them. ""I was raised in an orphanage, ward of the Church.""

Something he relates to. ""Oh Rahne, sorry. I know how orphanages can be. Spent a few years in on my self. I'm glad you found Dr MacTaggert though, I can't imagine what the church would think about what you can do.""

Rahne laughs lightly to that, ""Ah, kindred spirits, then,"" she says with a flash of a smile. A hand plays back over her spikey hair as she replies, ""Mum's done wonderful by me. She's as near to a saint as you'll find. But yeah, the church where I lived wasn't quite so keen on it. There was talk of exorcisms for a time.""

""Ouch."" he says in regard to exorcisms. But then Alex brings it to a lighter note, ""Have you been able to travel much? The way I see it, I'm pretty lucky, most of us Americans don't get out of the country. While Europeans tend to travel a lot.""

""I don't wager I've traveled half as well as you have."" Rahne sets her tea aside and then sits up straighter. ""I've spent far too much time learning to control the other bit of my nature and assisting around Mum's lab."" She looks curiously over at Alex, ""Just how far and wide have you traveled?""

He wonders about the 'other nature' but will not even go into it, instead Alex fields the question presented, ""Mostly the active tectonic regions for the geological studies, Hawaii, Easter Island, Peru, Japan, California - but that's where I studied and then did field work in New Mexico and Arizona. I spent a lot of time helping Archeological dig crews, pointing out good and bad places to dig, where might a tomb be located due to the density and hardness of rocks. Learned a lot on those. And now New York, my first experience here. What do you think of the city?""

Rahne plays Obvious Wolf. ""It's big,"" she says with a laugh. ""I've not spent much time in the city proper, honestly. I was just getting settled here when a trauma the kids needed a shoulder for happened, and now classes have begun."" She looks a tad remorseful, ""I really should get myself to the city. But och, I'd love to have visited even half of the places where you've worked. Do you think I could convince someone to send me to Hawaii if I picked up an interest in geology?""

Oh, there is such an opening right there, and he's not a shy one, ""I'd be glad to show you around Hawaii, rocks and all."". Somewhere inside that man brain of his, Alex was proud of that flirt, he even smiles some. 

Like a cobra, Alex strikes. And Rahne chuckles, her cheeks flushed a few shades. ""If you want to foot the bill, I don't think I could argue a guide,"" she says, her tone more playful than flirtatious.

There's so much more to say, to follow up on, but he's still testing the water and won't be pushy. He's made his point, and will back away just to allow it all to sink in. He'll note a, ""No problems there."" but then use the breath to continue with, ""I did a lot of surfing in Cali while I was there, and only got a few waves in Hawaii. They were amazing."" Just opening up other topics and giving the freedom to pursue other avenues.

Rahne laughs lightly, ""Surfing isn't something I've ever imagined trying. I worry the smell of wet dog could get a bit overwhelming."" She heaves a slow little sigh. ""I suppose I should get to those chores I am dodging, though,"" she says, climbing up to her feet and offering her hand again, ""It was nice to meet you though, Alex. I hope Dr. Grey can give you a hand. If you end up hanging around more, don't be afraid to look me up and tell me about rocks, aye?""

Alex holds back at her joke, just smiles, then notes as she is standing, he too stands to take her hand. There's a confident nod and a remark, ""I'm sure she can, and I'm sure I will."" answering both statement and question. ""Good meeting you. Rahne.""

After a shake of the hand, she heads for the door. ""If I spot Jeannie somewhere while I am in the halls, I'll yell at her to come down here quick as she can,"" Rahne promises before making her exit.

Alex watches her leave, then returns back to his boredom.

"event","First encounter of the day, a young guy named Tobias who could turn into fog. Interesting and very useful power. 

<LJ-CUT TEXT=""'Click to read' [Tobias, Havok]"">

Sitting in a straight backed, but comfortable chair of oak with heavy padding, Alex Masters is seen with a cup of tea upon a saucer in his left hand looking around the room. He currently wears hiking boots, jeans, a light blue t-shirt underneath a light colored sport coat. On his right knee is a napkin that once held a nicely cut triangular sandwich. Any rumors of his existence in the facility is that he's waiting on Dr Grey to get done with what she had been tied up with. And he's been here a while. It's a new day, and he's back, waiting more.

There has to be a place where someone can get a little bit of time to yourself around here, and Tobias Ryder is bound and determined to find it.  One of the new students on campus, Tobais peers into the room, large headset hanging around his neck and a book under his arm as he walks into the room.  He doesn't make it three feet before noticing the man sitting there.  Pushing up his glasses with his free hand, he sighs quietly, one is better than the handfuls everywhere else, and this guy sure as hell isn't student body.  The teen walks over to a couch and slumps into it, nodding to Alex as he opens his book to flip through the pages.

""Sup."". A common greeting offered by Alex as he's given the head nod from the youth who plops down on the couch. He turns slightly and places the teacup/saucer upon a nearby end table and returns to his normal silence.

""Reading,"" Tobias offers the obvious as he holds up his book, a thick Bostonian accent to his voice.  ""Looking to find a point away from the cloud hanging over the school,"" he remarks.  Being new, the death of the student here did not really affect him, which has put him a little distant from some of the more distraught students in the school.

Returning his attention to the youth, Alex questions, ""Yeah, I heard something bad went down. So what's up? Or can I ask that?"" - He takes the napkin from his knee and places it atop the tea cup. Then pulls his right ankle over his left knee to place his hands on either leg. 

And the book closes and gets dropped on the floor beside the couch as Tobias opts the put his feet on the end, looking at the ceiling.  ""Well, kid got killed by another one a few days back.  Some kind of a fight.  Whacked her head on a curb.  I didn't know her,"" he explains off hand.  ""Haven't seen you here before.  You teach?""

With a slight grimmace, Alex flinches at the thought of head trauma then recovering a bit he answers, ""Yeah, but not here. I teach at Emerson in the city. Just waiting on Dr Grey to get free. But I don't see that happening anytime soon with all that's been going on. Figured it was bad, but damn, not that bad. They get it all worked out with the authorities?""

Tobias shrugs in his utter lack of any real knowledge on the subject.  ""I hear the girl, well, guy, that did it got busted, going away for a while.""  The teen sighs and adjusts the headset around his neck as he's reclined.  ""I guess what I'm saying is that I don't know the whole story, just word about school.""

Offering a change of subject, as this one has come to a bitter end - just like the girl - Alex asks, ""So what are you studying? Or is this a general studies school, like high school?""

""I just take a little of everything,"" Tobias answers.  ""I like English a lot.  Poetry's pretty fun.""  He shrugs a little.  ""I already know what I'm going to be doing with my life anyways.""

""Oh yeah, what's that?"" Alex asks with some curiousity in tone.

""Hotel,"" Tobias says simply.  ""My parents own one back home on the Island.  I'm their only kid, so someone's going to have to make sure the place stays in the family.""

""So you're here to..."" given a brief pause to focus on the question, ""...learn about your abilities, get your studies done, graduate, then back to take over the family business? Or will you go to college for hospitality classes?""

Tobias looks over to the man for a moment, mulling the question over.  ""Pretty much.  I'll probably go to school for it.  Just for the degree.  Not like I don't have enough experience already.""

""That's kinda cool, inheriting and all that. Kinda like having it all laid out for you. Oh, by the way, I'm Alex."", giving afterthought to not having given his name, so Alex does.

""Tobias,"" he gives his own in turn.  ""Yeah, it's not so bad.  Not like I can say I dealt with much else.  Hell, talking to most folks here, my life is pretty sweet.""

He doesn't want to go back to the topic of /here/, as it's already established that this place is in a funk, so Alex notes a little about himself, ""I teach geology and geophysics, graduated Berkeley a few years back, did my time as a geologist in the field, doing lots of on site work, love it. Miss it even, cannot believe I ended up being a teacher. Probably won't do it for more than a year though, the city is totally not for me. But all in all, it's been a pretty good life.""

Tobias nods as he listens, only somewhat cataloging this for later.  ""So,"" he starts, eyeing the man from the side of his glasses, ""You got to be pretty mutant friendly to be so calm hanging around here.  Unless you are one.""

With a brief lopsided smile, Alex gives a chuckle and says, ""Mutant friendly, mutant, pretty much just want to get it straightened out. Hence the appointment with Jean. But yeah, it's all good. I just wish life was a little easier out there for mutant kind. I'm guessing you being a student here makes you the same?""

""Ayuh,"" Tobias says with small grin.  ""And believe me, I know what it's like.  I spent two years hiding what I was.  Course, even in a small town on the water, people around where I'm from love to keep their mouths shut about things?""

""So now, you're out of the proverbial closet?"" Alex lends a smile to the reference, ""I mean, I see how mutants are treated on a daily basis on the news, in public, etc. And dude (said like a surfer), I totally don't want to be on the bad end of that stick. It's like being black in the 40's, 50's and 60's. Or worse.""

""Pretty much,"" Tobias says with a nod.  Looking down to his poetry book, he grins a little.  ""And I think it's a metaphor, coming out of the closet, not a proverb,"" he adds, rolling back onto his back.  ""But yeah, I come from a pretty liberal place and all, but still don't talk about things like that.""

After a chuckle, Alex notes, ""That's why I teach Geology, not English. Metaphors, Proverbs, Nouns, all that is Greek to me. I'm glad though, that people like us have a place like this.""

""Ayup,"" Tobias says with a faint smile.  ""I was probably the only one in my school.  Glad they never found out, well, till just a week ago or so when I came here.  Probably would have been drummed out of the place.""

""That's what I'm thinking will happen if I'm outed at Emerson. I suspect that I'll be king of the blacklist."" Alex says in a sarcastic tone. ""Still, the more I think on it, the less I think I'll mind. I'd just go back to field work and other countries. The states are really fanitical when it comes to stuff like this.""

""What's it that you do?"" Tobias asks, looking over to the man.  ""I mean, I'd be booted pretty much because of what I can.  But I guess what matters is you having something to keep you busy.""

Alex asks for clairification, ""Power wise?""

Tobias nods.

""From what I gather, I absorb ambient energy, build it up, and discharge it in the form of what I think is plasma. All in all, it's pretty destructive, and I mean like blowing stuff up or vaporizing things."" Alex notes with a slight grimmace. ""Just looking to get it under control, cause if I don't discharge it on a regular basis, it sort of forces me to at the most inconvenient of times.""

""Wow.  So, yeah, you'd be a danger to the kids they'd say.  Lock you away like a loaded gun or something,"" Tobias says flatly.  ""At least I'd just get kicked out because people would say I was cheating by using my powers whenever I got a good grade.""

""So telepathic of sorts?"" Alex asks trying to narrow down Tobias' power.

With a snort of laughter, Tobias shakes his head.  ""Nope,"" he says, shutting his eyes as he decides to just show rather than explain.  The teen on the couch fades away into a smoky wisp.  A roll of fog moves across the room, building up a few feet away and reforming along the wall into Tobias again.  The teen cleaning off his glasses.  ""That.""

""Dude"", said in a surfer tone of amazement, ""That's sweet. I didn't say this, but like, the girls locker room would totally be the place to roll."" Alex showes his devious side and thinks how Tobias' power is far more useful than his. ""I've been amazed at some of the powers I've seen on the news. Heck, it was some guy up here who has seismic control which drew me up here in the first place.""

Tobias walks back over towards the couch again to sit, grinning slyly.  ""Yeah, had that one suggested to me.  Though I won't tell you if I have or not,"" he says with a short laugh.  The talk of seismic control gets a short shake of his head.  ""Looking for an assistant?"" he jokes.

With a chuckle, Alex shakes his head and says, ""Nah, more like ... well, it's just a long story. Suffice it to say, I came up here thinking there was tectonic activity, turned out it was a mutant effect. Ended up running into someone who referred me to Emerson, and well, there you have it, my story.""

Settling his glasses back on his face, Tobias nods a short bit.  ""So, you're here to see which student shakes stuff up?"" he asks, looking back over towards Alex.

""Nah, just here for me. If I run into him, cool, but I've already put that to rest."" Alex answers as he stands up and moves to look at something on a shelf.

Tobias ahs, nodding slowly.  ""So you're here for yourself, and waiting for Dr. Grey.  I get you,"" he says with a sly grin.

Alex glances back briefly, ""Well, Dr Grey is easy on the eyes."" Then turns back to the framed photograph. ""How many students are here, any idea?""

Tobias just shrugs and shakes his head.  ""I've been here a week or two,"" he says, ""I got no clue how many people I see come and go around here.""

Moving to a nearby window, Alex looks out, he's a little restless. His thumbs go into his front pocket corners and he looks for activity on the lawn. ""I think I need to stretch my legs."", is noted as a side remark letting the last subject go into the aether. ""Been sitting here for..."" checking his watch, ""More than an hour.""

""Have fun,"" Tobias says, reaching down for his book.  ""Good luck with the mope going down around here.""

""Thanks man, be careful out there."" Alex notes as he starts his walk through a door.

"event","Made it into Salem Center last night. I prefer the rail system of Europe over the States. It's a little more accommodating there and the seats are not made of plastic. I was referred to a local B&B that I signed into, slept like a king. That's one thing the east coast has that the rest of the world should try to emulate, a nice bed and breakfast. 

Today is not a day I'm looking forward to. Keeping a low profile, I've got to get through some picketers (if they're still there) and then onto the Xavier Property. Albeit I have an appointment, it'll still be 'exposure', something I do not want. At least I can still claim geological study and further investigation into the tremors of late, which is totally what I'm going to do if questions are posed. 

So, after breakfast, I'll be journeying that way. Time to shower."

"event","Shared a cab ride with a lovely girl named Alexis that works at a place called Bella's in the Village. Some place I should visit in the future. The unique thing about the cab ride was that it was the ""Cash Cab"" - some reality television program. Kinda cool actually.

<LJ-CUT TEXT=""'Alex's for the Win!' [Alexis, Alex]"">

Alex Masters is traveling northward and is currently in the Lower East Side of Manhattan Island. He hailed a cab. The yellow checker pulls to the side of the road where he slips into the back seat. (Giving time for Alexis to also enter the cab on the opposite side, not seeing Alex as he too got in.) 

Currently Alex wears hiking boots, jeans, a red t-shirt and carries a brown worn leather backpack. His hair isn't all that neat and his face seems to have a determined scowl upon it. He's about to give the location of where he's going...

Alexis hurries to cross the street with a brown grocery bag in one hand and a backpack slung over the opposite shoulder which falls lopsidedly onto her elbow as she moves quickly toward the cab that just pulled up. She opens the door, stuffing herself inside before she notices it was occupied. The girl, dressed in jeans and a fitted t-shirt that reveals a sliver of her stomach, looks over at Alex. ""Er...I think he stopped for me."" She says tentatively, not used to standing up for herself, even for the sake of cabs.

Alex turns to notice the new entry just as he was saying something about 5th and Vine and addresses the newcomer, ""You headed uptown?"" he questions with a slight pause, ""Cause it'd probably be cheaper to share."" 

The guy behind the steering wheel is a bald white male who mentions, ""More the merrier.""

Alexis settles her bag on the seat between them. ""Oh, sure. We can share."" She looks up to the cab driver, giving him the address of her own destination before settling back into her seat and stretching a little.

The cab is long, and shaped like a mini-van. There is a partial plexi glass screen that is open between the cab driver and the passenger compartment. Once establishing where his two fares are traveling, he pushes down the meter and as lights illuminate the ceiling and a brief musical noise is heard, he says, ""Welcome to the Cash Cab, where during your ride you will be asked questions. If you get them right, you can win money. So, you ready to play.""

Alex pauses a second, looks back at his travel companion, and then back at the cabby, ""Uh, yeah. I guess."" Then asking the girl, ""You in?""

Alexis chuckles. ""It's like a game show. Heck yeah, I'm in."" Amused, she glances from Alex back up toward the front of the cab, waiting and attempting to tug random trivia to the front of her brain.

The cabby puts the cab into gear and says, ""We've got 27 blocks to go. During our drive, if you miss any of the questions, you get a strike. Three strikes and you're out. So, let's get started. Question number one. On July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Indpendence was adopted. Who was the first person to sign the document?""

Alex notes half under his breath and says, ""I teach college geology, not history."" Turning to the girl he says, ""Hi, I'm Alex and all I really remember are Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Washington and John Hancock.""

Alexis is a high school drop out, so they're not starting out so well. She thinks back. ""Uh...I'm not exactly sure...I think it was John Hancock, 'cause he signed it real big right and then everyone else had to do it real small around his?"" Sounded logical to her but she still shrugs, leaving the official answer up to the man to give. ""Oh, I'm Alex too."" She says with a smile. ""Well, Alexis really.""

Settling back in his seat, Alex's former scowl has lightened some. He drops his pack securely between his feet. There's even a hint of a smile after the Cab driver says, ""John Hancock is absolutely correct."" Alex then notes, ""Right on.""

""Next question."" the cabby asks, ""Which is closer to the Equator, Easter Island, or the Hawaiian Islands?"" Alex interjects, ""I've been to both."" he notes mostly to Alexis who just introduced herself and he then follows with, ""Easter island is far south while the Hawaiian Islands are a little closer.""

Alexis grins happily as the first answer was correct. The second question draws a complete blank. ""Uh..."" But Alex saves the day and she nods to him with an impressed raising of her brows. ""Well, if you've been there, you'd know."" She replies, agreeable to let his answer pass for both of them.

The cabby chuckles and says, ""Yes, he's been there and he is correct.""

The meter on the cab shows positive money, it's gone from 25 to 50 dollars with no X's on the screen. Alex grins and then says, ""Alex, we're rollin now.""

Alexis giggles and offers her hand for a high five. ""Alex's for the Win! So what's next? I wanna see how much more pampering I can afford for a trip to the salon.""

A followthrough with the high-five is performed by the other Alex. Then, making a turn, the cabby navigates through heavy traffic and comes to a stop at a light. ""Red light double bonus question: What ethnic group was largely responsible for building most of the early railways in the U.S. West?"" Alex looks over at Alexis, ""I'm thinking Kung Fu.""

Alexis hmmms and looks quizzically over to the man, ""Kung Fu?"" She asks, way to young to remember that one. ""Uh, I dunno that one either, but I would've guessed Blacks. You think it was what, Chinese people?""

Alex chuckles, ""When i was young, Kung Fu was in reruns, I was a total fan. It was about this chinaman who walked the desert and there were thousands of chinese railroad workers that he helped out from the oppressive white man, so yeah, Chinese.""

The cabby smiles really big, ""Interesting approach to the answer to that question, which is totally correct!""

Alexis laughs, ""And people say TV makes you dumb...I knew it was all lies. Too bad there was nothing about the railroads in 'I love Lucy', then I might have had a chance.""

The Meter registers 100 dollars. The cabby notes, ""Now, we're moving into the round where you make 50 dollars per question.""

Alex smiles to Alexis's remark. Then states, ""Yeah, I remember nothing about Lucy other than stomping on grapes."" The cabby then steps up and asks, ""Next Question: Which two wicked cities were destroyed by God in Genesis?"" Alex gets quiet and gets a look of confusion on his face, ""Wicked cities?"" turning to Alexis.

Alexis chuckles, ""Seriously? Lucy and Mary Tyler Moore were like the best shows ever."" The teen pauses to hear the next question and smiles. ""Sodom and Gomorrah,"" She replies with ease to the driver giving Alex a confident nod.

Alex repeats her words and notes, ""Oh, duh, all I could think of was Babylon and Jerusalem."" The cabby then gives a nod as he's making another turn and states, ""The girl Alex is right. Sodom and Gamorrah are those cities that God wiped out.""

Alex chuckles and states, ""We make a pretty good team.""

Alexis laughs, ""I know. We totally need to go on the professional game show circuit. We could make a pretty good living.""

After a smile and a nod from Alex to Alexis, the cabby then questions after the meter registers 150 dollars. ""What planet in our solar system is closest to the size of the Earth's moon? Is it, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, or Mercury?"" 

Alex says the names back and then starts to rationalize, ""Jupiter is far to big, Venus is about the size of the Earth, and Mars is just a little smaller, it's got to be Mercury."" Turning to Alexis giving her a chance to interject if she has an argument otherwise.

Alexis thinks over his reply, nodding as it makes sense to her too. ""Uh...yeah, sure. That sounds good-Mercury."" This is by far the best cab ride ever.

The cabby says, ""Absolutely right, Mercury is the closest in size to the Earth's moon."" 

Over the next few minutes, several other questions are asked, giving Alex and Alexis a total of 550 dollars in cash to split between themselves. Getting out of the cab, the cabby says, ""You two did great, thanks for riding in the Cash Cab.""

Out on the street, Alex is dividing the money and he says with a smile, ""Hey, thanks, you really pulled us out of the fire on a few of those questions. And now we're super-mega-rich."" 

Alexis slings her backpack over her shoulder and then sets the paper bag on the sidewalk next to her. ""You did too. Wow, I can't believe we made that much money just riding in a cab. Are you sure you don't have somewhere else to go?"" She jokes, ""A few more rides and I could cover rent for the month.""

Alex hands over her half of the money and pockets his. With a smile, he notes, ""Yeah, I've got an appointment tomorrow up state that I really can't miss. But if you're ever in the geology department at Emerson, look me up, I teach there. Alex Masters."".

Alexis takes her portion and pockets it as well. ""A professor? No wonder you're so smart. Well, if you're ever in the mood for a drink, come down to Bella's in the Village. I work there."" She picks up her groceries. ""Nice to meet you Alex.""

""Good meeting you."" he says in parting, ""Take care."" - With that, he is off, walking north toward a metro station. Slinging his pack and suring up his walk, Alex fades into the crowd.

"event","Havok's Incredible Journey is in day 2 of this multi day event. Temporal mechanics be dammed!

The way it is working out is such that I (Havok's player) am unable to knock out the entire trip in one real life/time day. Havok is a moving scene, allowing the character to have multiple encounters as he crosses the city. Think back to the movie ""The Warriors"" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warriors_%28film%29 ; the main characters/street gang were/was moving from Harlem to Coney Island during a 4-8 hour period. During that time, they had many encounters. Most of them were violent. Don't count on too much violence here.

But like with any long scene, real life tends to move faster than the game, so Havok is stuck on day one, while the rest of us move on with life.

What I ask in this OOC notice is that during this week, I seek players who have characters which haven't been played in a while, could be out of time, or just able to be RP'able with a time stamp of yesterday (any yesterday will do).

So if you're up for this, see Havok online, and feel a little giddy, then please contact me and we can keep this scene ball rolling."

<LJ-CUT TEXT=""'It just doesn't have the same piss smell like in Phile, makes me home sick.' [Magnes, Havok]"">

9/5/2007

Alex Masters, PhD, steps off of a subway train onto the platform deep beneath the city. Admist a crowd of patrons of the subway system, he walks carrying a backpack of leather, wearing a red tshirt, jeans, hiking boots, and a scowl. He looks about the area, searching for an exit, trying to just get away from these people.

Magnes is also coming off the train himself, walking in rollerblades until he's completely off, bumping into Alex when someone pushes into him. ""Hey are you trying to kill me?"" Raising a fist at the other person, then looking to Alex. ""Sorry about that.""

Alex is already on edge, when he's bumped into, he turns and is ready to face who ever struck him. His turn is sharp and his fists are made. Realizing quickly, he sees that it's unintentional and hears the guy's words, then looks at the other person who pushed the person who collided with him. His jaw is tight, and this could be adding to his already 'bad day'.

""You alright? Being underground too long can be pretty stressing."" Starting to skate toward the steps and walking upstairs with the clicking of his wheels against the steps. ""It just doesn't have the same piss smell like in Phile, makes me home sick."" Talking to himself with a shake of his head.

Seeing how things digressed quickly, Alex turns and walks the same direction as the person on blades. He notes, ""Underground ain't so bad, it's all the people."" displaying some clausterphobia. ""Though, I doubt I'd be homesick for the smell of piss."" He too begins ascending the stairs.

Magnes laughs and looks down at the guy once at the top of the steps. ""When you've been in the city long enough, piss sort of becomes more like a background smell, hell as a kid I used to think it was someone cooking soup in the hospital."" Rolling in circles at the top of the stairs and waiting for Alex. ""What are you doing in the city anyway? If you don't mind me asking.""

Alex shudders with a slight grin at the soup comment, then with a shake of his head he notes, ""Aside from trying to get across town, getting pick pocketed, and just tired of people constantly on top of one another, I'm a teacher at Emerson University. How about you?""

Magnes bows with his right arm across his stomach, slowly rolling backward. ""Magnes J. Varlane, student at Emerson University. Only for one year though."" Standing up straight and skating in circles again, smelling the fresh air. ""You got pick pocketed? Sounds like you have one of those Homer Simpson curses with New York.""

With the words of him noting he's a student at Emerson. Then onto the other listing Alex pauses having reached the landing and looks about the city, reveling in the light and open space, ""Dude, you just don't know the half of it. But nevermind that, if you're into geology or geophysics, you may want to drop in one of my classes, least next semester. Alex Masters.""

""Well I am into physics in general, so I'll check it out."" Stopping and sliding his hands into his pockets, Magnes stares up at the sky, then looks back down at Alex. ""Where are you going anyway? I was thinking about calling this hot asian chick I met the other day, but I don't know I might find something else to do first.""

Distracted by the question, Alex grins and says, ""Stick to the hot asian chick, I'm not really going anywhere important."" He then looks down the street for a cab and waves to hail it. Turning back to his temporary companion, he says with finality, ""It was good meeting ya. Be careful out there.""

Waving, Magnes starts to skate off. ""Later! Don't get mugged!"" He yells back, dodging people on the street.

"event","<LJ-CUT TEXT=""'<< Rock, >> answers Jono. Hey, what's a geologist's favourite kind of- ow, bad pun, bad pun! ' [Jono, Havok]"">

9/5/2007

Alex just entered a subway train car. As with the rest of the morning crowd, he shuffled into the cabin and moved to the side. Slipping his leather backpack off the red t-shirted shoulder, Alex shoves his hand into his backpack and a lok of rage crosses his face. He looks sharply up and out the windows of the train. He yells, ""YOU LITTLE SHIT!"". 

Causing a slight disturbance upon the car. He shoves his way toward the closing doors and is stopped by the number of people and that the train starts to move. Outside, on the platform stands an oily looking shorter man of wirey stature (Toad). Alex watches, helpless, pointing through the door and mouthing something at the other man. 

Then in a huff, Alex moves from the door to a nearby chair and takes a seat <perhaps next to Jono> while opening his pack and feeling around. Keys jingle. He's pissed.

The skinny man Alex takes a seat next to moves just enough to give him more room to take inventory. Even on a mild September day, Jono is dressed in his usual black-on-black-on-black ensemble, complete with a thin scarf covering the lower portion of his face. << What'd he take? >> the telepath asks conversationally. It doesn't look like his mouth is moving under that scarf.

Alex is too busy sifting through his pack to notice the lack of mouth movement and answers in a pissed tone, ""My ibook."" And then says some label of a word that starts with an f under his breath referring to the Toad. ""Doubt I'll ever get it back, but if I find him..."" and he pauses looking over to his bench partner dressed in black. With a slight confused look at the garments he wears, but figures it's just part of the whole New York culture.

Jono is used to that look. It doesn't bother him. << Fucker, >> says the Englishman of the theif. Although part of him does sort of wonder what kind of person refers to their computer by its brand name. << Know how you feel though, mate. Just had someone break in to my place last week. >> Though his burglar had been a /moron/ and had passed over the beautifully restored vintage guitar in favour of the slightly shinier newer model worth less than half as much. Criminals these days- no taste at /all/.

""I've not seen so much crime and corruption since, hell, never. Shoulda stayed in Peru."" Alex notes and then turning his attention back to his pack, he zips it closed and rests it on his lap, he then asks, ""What'd ya lose?""

<< A guitar and some cash I had laying around. Coulda been worse- arsehole took the second cheapest one in the flat, >> he tells him. << Probably just some junkie. Gonna call the cops about it? >> he asks, nodding to the bag that had once held Alex's iBook. His tone-of-headvoice suggests that he does not find that option particularly effective.

With a slight shake of his head in disgust, Alex says, ""Cops got their hands full with all the other crap going on, they don't have time for a lost computer."" He flashes to the information on the computer, detailing his own life and nature of being a mutant. He hopes the cops never see the data. ""Nah, I'll just get another one. But you got lucky with the guitar."" He tries to move on and offers to change the subject, ""Where ya from?""

<< London,>> Jono says, then adds, because he's gotten used to talking to Americans << England, >>. Although this one said he'd been in Peru, so he may just be a bit more geographically aware than his fellow Yanks. << You don't look like a native of Peru. Unless I /really/ wasn't paying attention in Social Studies. You from around here originally? >>

""Alaska, originally. But I've been all over. Even spent a little time on your side of the pond, Western Ireland for a time. I'm a geologist. Alex Masters."" He introduces himself and continues, ""Currently I teach at Emerson over in Queens.""

<< Jono Starsmore. Figured you weren't a New Yorker- seeing as you're actually aknowledging my existence, >> he says dryly. << But you never know. >> A geologist and a former rock star meet on the subway. There's a joke in there somewhere, but Jono can't seem to find it. 

""Oh, and there's that. People aren't all that nice here either. Dude, I'd much rather be on the beach catching some sun."" Alex could have a touch of surfer accent in there too, but it's rare, he's just a little more articulate. He then asks, ""So what do ya do?""

<< I'm a musician, >> which may explain why he's /riding the damn subway/. << Getting more in to behind the scenes stuff now, though. Production, mixing, songwriting, that sorta thing. >>

""That's pretty sweet."" Alex notes shuffling his pack a little, eyes glancing out the window at the passing scenery <subway tunnels and lights> beyond. ""I seem to meet a lot of them in this city, that and students, teachers, and just joe normal that works at a local diner. What kinda music?"" 

<< Rock, >> answers Jono. Hey, what's a geologist's favourite kind of- ow, bad pun, bad pun! << Had an EP out a while back but- eh, you know how stuff goes. >> Your drummer quits, you explode on stage and cripple your girlfriend when your mutation manifests- shit happens, man.

""Yeah, shit gets in the way of life and fun. I know all about it."" He's still pissed about other things than just losing his computer, but that's totally for another time. The train is coming to a stop, ""Dude, good luck."" Alex notes as he stands, ""This is my stop."" -It's not really, Alex is just feeling a little closterphobic with all these people around, New York is too full of people for his tastes.

Try being a telepath in crowd. << Nice meeting you mate. Good luck with the computer, >> says Jono, giving the bloke a casual salute as the other man leaves.

9/5/2007

Subway System - Beneath Manhattan - Midtown Platform

Standing on the platform, Alex Masters is just another face within a sea of people waiting on the next northbound train. His hands are in his pockets, and he looks tired, weathered, it's been a long night, and he doesn't appear to like where he is going.

Despite the usual crowds of the subway, it still beats the packed sidewalks of New York's early morning meanders. The little, squat, sickish looking man is done up in a grimy long sleeved jacket, his trusty New York Knicks hat shoved up over green locks of hair that press flat against his oily forehead. He moves quietly, occasionally lifting a wallet from a pocket or a loosely slung purse. Each tidbit, whether money or as simple as house keys, are slipped into the many pockets of his cargo pants. Toad finally pats the latest little theft, a jump drive out of a computer case, and shuffles off to the side of the platform, away from the crowds.

Hiking boots, jeans, and a spotted, slightly wet red t-shirt covers Alex's athletic frame. He holds a leather backpack on his left shoulder. That pack seems to be the weight of his world right now, or a representation of what ever is upon his back that causes him to carry himself so low. Eyes narrow with a slight frown as he's bumped into from his left. Some 17 year old punk kid was dancing about with his friends, and inadvertently collided. 

Above, the flourscent lighting washes the room in a bluish tint, giving a flicker every 60 milliseconds. The hum that it gives off is only drowned out by the noise of the croud and various trains that come and go from the 4 adjacent tracks. 

Alex's leather backpack is slightly open and inviting, there may be something of significant value in there. Another train rolls in, not his, so he waits more, being bumped by the crowds as they pass him standing.

Toad's hands wiggle at his pockets. Two wallets, a set of keys, a laser pointer, and a jumpdrive are his spoils. He does not exactly need them, but the sport is intriguing, as is the chase. Toad scans the crowd, deciding if he should test his luck. Acting very much a concerned, humble citizen, Toad takes the two steps sideways without a single look to Alex's backpack. ""Yer know wot that last train woz?"" The small, yellowish man inquires to Alex in a rough British tone.

Not registering the question, Alex hears it as if he's in some tunnel. It takes him a second and then he turns his gaze to the smaller statured man. ""Pardon?"" he asks in return. Perhaps it's the accent, or that he was off in his own world.

""The train,"" Toad repeats, pointing a finger towards the tracks. ""Wot's that last train that came by, mate?""

Alex looks around for a sign like you would find in an airport, there are none. ""Sorry, no idea. I'm waiting for the F. It may have been the B."" Alex returns his attention to the guy. Noting the 'oil' of his skin/hair. Not frowning or showing reaction to it, just noticing. He pulls something from his pocket, a narrow sheet of glossy paper that has the train schedule and line drawings that cross town. ""This may help."" and he offers the sheet.

Toad bobs his head, eyes focusing in on the papers. ""Oi, brilliant,"" the short man hums happily, leaning forward to pinch the sheet between his fingers. The other hand makes to pat the other on his back. ""Thanks,"" he says and releases the stiff pat, hand making a skillful slip into the backpack, fingers fishing carefully.

Toad will feel the following within the large pocket of the backpack: Jeans, Tshirt, underwear, socks, a few loose DVD's, a small mac ibook, keys that jingle, a rock hammer, sheathed knife, and a few loose rocks. 

Alex doesn't notice the 'pilfering' of his pack, his attention turns back to the approaching train, reading the letter on it, he mumbles, ""B, that's my ride."" and will shift forward toward the red line.

""So it is, aye."" Toad sounds a little distracted, perhaps momentarily puzzled at the contents. The slick surface of the ibook is gripped with sticky fingers, a quick pull upsetting the keys like a trip wire. Toad backs up, catching his breath and hoping that the man thinks nothing of it. The ibook is tucked behind his back as quick as his reflexes recover.

Alex notices nothing (yet), he's already back in his world of reticentance. The train arrives, people get off, he and a few others shuffle onto the train. That's when he notices the 'lightness' of his pack. He slips it off his shoulder and reaches into it, suddenly realizing that the ibook isn't there. The doors close. His eyes immediately peer through the window out at the crowd, looking for the smaller man.

Toad is there. Of course, since this is a rare nugget of opportunity to bask in the thrill of his trade. The ibook is held up for Alex to see, a wide, yellow-toothed grin on his green face as his other hand wiggles it's fingers peevishly.

There's a sudden rage that comes over the face of Alex. Inside the train he can be heard yelling, ""YOU LITTLE SHIT!"" and he goes for the closed doors. The train begins to depart, the crowd is too thick, he cannot force the doors open, he struggles, his eyes peer through the doors watching the Toad as the train departs. He points and mouths something to the effect of, ""I'll find you.""

The contents on the hard drive are as follows: Journal (seen on havok's live journal) that lists the last 10 years of his life. Detailing his mutant powers, his resistance to using them, his life as a geologist, travels about the world. Further, there's information about his job at Emerson University, lesson plans, teaching agendas. Geological information, and in the web information, links to various geological web sites, etc.

Toad barks out into laughter, the people around him uninformed or uncaring to the situation. His prize is tucked under his arm and he turns, slipping quickly away from the crowds and subway in case Alex makes his way back any time soon.

8/8/2007

Alex is found dressed up today, at least dressed up for him. Wearing a polo shirt of deep blue, black slacks and shoes of the same color, he's noted sitting in the small coffee shop of the Guggenheim, it's toward the back of the museum, near the book/novelty/gift store. His hair is even slightly combed, but still not really neat, perhaps it's just the style of the day. Either way, in front of him he has a book that he's been reading for who knows how long, and to the left on the table is a cup of something.

Jean is carrying a second cup of something.  Her particular something is a latte, accompanied by a small plate with a pair of biscotti on it, and an attache case in the crook of her arm.  Neatly dressed for a day in the city, she's settled on a little black dress and a necklace of some silvery brushed metal in chain links flat and thick against the hollow of her throat.  ""Dr. Masters?""  she wonders, appearing at his elbow like something summonned.  There is, alas, a regretable lack of purple smoke.

Looking up from his reading, surprised by the sudden arrival, Alex closes his book and places it upon the table as he stands, ""Please, just Alex."" he notes with a warm smile which is followed by a, ""Thanks for coming, please, join me?""

""All right then, 'Just Alex',""  Jean awards, with a slowly blossoming smile as she sits, adjusting her chair with a shift of one hip and a brace of one leg to scrape it in closer to the table once she's settled.  ""And of course you'll have to call me 'Jean' in trade, but how are you today?""

""A little anxious actually, but you probably already know that."" He pauses, regretfully, 'The Girl from Ipanema' flowing in his head and then he continues with, ""So, I guess I'd better get started.""  He too takes a seat across from her, squaring off and leaning slightly forward while keeping his voice low as not to attract attention and a stray thought of how lovely she looks passes through his head before he refocuses on the point at hand.

Tall and tan and young and lovely-- Delicately, Jean raises one hand to her forehead and pinches at the bridge of her nose, a warding sign against mental elevator music to go with a more useful retuning of mental shields, before she awards Havok a smile, and notes that ""If you like, I'd be happy to send you some information on mental defense techniques for non-telepaths.   But don't let me change the conversation,""  she grants, and awards him an encouraging little twirl of her fingers.

After a reflective smile, Alex continues on, ""Ok, I'll just lay it all out. I've got a few things to cover, so I'll start at the beginning. I've got this ability. Had it since my teens and well, it's been a hassle for the most part. See, I seem to build up this charge, and if I don't expell it, then bad things happen. But, anyway, I figured you'd know what to do, or point me in a direction where I could get assistance with it.""

Businesslike, Jean meets this wall of words with nothing more or less than an attentive nod, and an alert narrowing of green eyes from over her coffee mug.  A sip taken, she sets it down and nods once again.  ""Have you had any tests done?""  she wonders, first and foremost.

""No. None at all. I've not even told anyone about it until you. Figured it'd go away one day."" Typical guy response. Alex pauses for a second and then notes, ""You know, the government and all that hostility toward people with abilities. And now that I sort of fell into this job back here in the States, then I figure it'd be best if I could just find a way to turn it off.""

Jean hums understanding at the mention of governments and hostility, lips thinning in a bit of negative reflection for a moment.  ""Understandable,""  she assures, voice a conversational murmur to ward off any curious set sof ears wandering past. ""I'd be happy to help you, Alex, but you do need to understand that it may not be -possible- to turn it off.  In most cases of abilities powerful enough to be noticed, control is the best we can hope for.""

There's a dissapointed look in this reluctant hero's eyes. A slight sigh and then a brief biting of the lower lip while he considers the 'control' option. ""Yeah, great..."" After he rubs his lips with his fingertips he then says, ""So, how do we figure it all out and what's it gonna cost me?""

""Cost?""  Jean blinks for a moment at this.  ""Oh, no cost, Alex,""  she assures.  ""The actual lab work, well, reagents for genetic and molecular work aren't horrifically expensive when you're using economies of scale, and we already -have- the MRI machine, whether you use it or not.""

""Oh."", he says, ""Well then. So, got any way to your lab where I won't be seen by big brother?"" - Alex is definitely wary of becoming marked as a mutant, it's been painfully obvious since day one.

""Well, -my- lab is in-town, but it's for my little genetics company, rather than a medical facilty.  I've used it before, though,""  Jean muses, pursing her lips and staring off into the space to the left of Havok's ear with an expression of elegant abstraction.  ""Gradient Genetech, up on the sixth floor of the McClintock Center. MRIs would have to be done at Lennox Hill, since I have some privileges there as a consultant... bit of a wait time.  If you could come out to Westchester, that would -probably- be ideal.""

""Yeah, that Westchester thing."" Alex says reluctantly then tosses in a new subject as he distracts himself so he can think about it and weigh the pros and cons, ""Question, I ran into one of your students, girl named Alyssa, she said that I looked like some teacher at your place, some guy named Summers.""

Jean first looks surprised, and then turns a considering look on Havok, mentally subtracting a few years and a pair of sunglasses.    Head tilted to one side, lips still pursed, she admits that ""I guess I could see it.  You have a similar frame.  Did she say why?""

""Nah, no such luck as to the why's. And normally I'd blow it off, but well, I was adopted, and I had a brother, I think. Never found him, and the way things have been falling lately, with running into a few Xavier students, you, Xavier himself, I just figured weird things like that run in flocks. Even though it's a total longshot."" Alex reflects mostly in his notations, giving himself a lot of time to try and remember, but he really doesn't. And though he could favor Scott, so could half the eastern seaboard. Alex shrugs and it just shooting in the dark.

""Did your brother have a name?""  Jean wonders, expression more vaguely curious than someone anticipating a miracle.  ""Scott was adopted as well, and I guess stranger things have happened.  Have you ever looked into one of those adoption investigation agencies?""

""I'm sure he does, but have no idea and well, still not even convinced I have one. I figured I just made him up to have an imaginary friend in the adoption center."" Alex notes with a shrug. ""Agencies never had the leads to follow up on. And never knew my real name.""

""Now -that's- a little odd...""  Jean murmurs, but, in a moment of late-breaking manners, doesn't pry beyond that.  ""Well, if you're the proud owner of an X-factor, there's a significant chance that your brother, whoever he is, would have one too.""

""So, when do you have time for me in Westchester?"" - Alex is feeling a little more comfortable with the whole thing, still he'll make a lot of precations when coming to the school to conseal his identity, but he's just being paranoid.

At last the attache case opens!  Although it's only so that Jean can reach in and pull out a small PDA, sleek and be-stylus'd.  Tappity-tap, and a scheduling application opens, rows of meticulously blocked off hours skimmed over in the search for something free.  ""Ahah,""  she murmurs, confortable in victory.  ""Could you make something on Friday morning?  Pass it off as a final look into the seismic activity?""

Accepting this, Alex will have a pen handy and write the appointment down on his hand. ""Sounds great. Thanks Jean."" 

""Any time,""  Jean assures, fencing with the PDA a little more before returning it to its nest in the attache case.  ""Now, I believe I have coffee to drink, and then a museum to wander around, since I made a donation to get in here.""

Alex will depart with a relieved expression and leave her to her day.

<LJ-CUT TEXT=""'Have you ever heard of Xavier's School?' [Alyssa, Alex]"">

8/1/2007

Knelt down on one knee, Alex Masters finds himself looking across a few spines reading titles of geological books. Currently he's dressed casually, blue tshirt, jeans, hiking boots, and hasn't bothered to brush his hair, or maybe that's the style. Near to him are tables, chairs, a study area, there are a few books of the geological kind on a nearby table next to a tattered leather backpack. 

Displaced, misplaced, certainly out of place: Alyssa drifts through the college library, occasionally taking interest in some subject; most of what she peruses pertain to art, but there are a few other subjects as out of place as she herself is.  She manders toward geology, a leggy brunette with shoulder-length hair caught up in two low pigtais, one on either side of her head.  She wears slightly worn jeans and a tank top, coupled with motorcycle boots.

Alex will, being a guy, notice the approach of the brunette. He glances up, will give a nod if eye contact is met. All the while he holds a finger on a book that he was about to pull. 

Aly, being Aly, notices the attention; her smile is bright, brilliant, and openly friendly.  She doesn't say anything -- at least, not yet -- but instead offers a little finger-wiggled greeting and a mouthed, library-appropriate, 'hello.'

Alex smiles, hard not to when someone else does the same and he pulls the book from the shelf to slowly stand up and clear the way for her passing if that is what she's doing. 

There's a long and lazy look as Alex stands up, down and then up, and up some more.  Her smile ramps up a notch or two, and mutant-bright (though carefully controlled) green eyes speak of nothing short of appreciation.  ""Thank you,"" she murmurs as she passes, though she stops just past him to turn around, and survey him again.  ""You from around here?""  Her voice hints that she isn't -- though a trace of New York has diluted her accent, it's still ovciously not local.

With her question, he turns slightly to address her with an answer, ""Nah, been livin abroad for a few years and before that Berkeley. You a student here?"" Alex follows with a question as he maintains the book within his left hand, poised to open it with his right.

""Naw,"" Aly admits slowly studying his face with more than a little attention to detail.  ""That's in California, right?""  She tilts her head slightly to one side, looking down a the book.  ""Geology, huh?  You got any family?  Brothers, anything like that?""

""Full of questions."" Alex notes with a slight smile and then gestures with his hand while answering, ""Let's see. Berkeley is in Cali, yeah, got my PhD in Geophysics there. Not real family that I'm aware of, but yeah, kinda family. How about you? If you don't attend school here, what do you do?""

""Not real family?""  Aly /is/ full of questions, but she manages to ask them with the sweetest smile and widest eyes: completely harmless!  ""So, like, adopted or something?  And I'm in advertising.  Work for a company in the city -- thinking about going to college, though.""

Nodding, Alex takes in her words and considers her current location, ""Yeah, adopted. So what about college? What do you want to study? More advertising or something a little more down to earth."" he notes the book he's holding with the free hand, showing the spine <Geological Survey of the Toba Caldera>.

""I'm an artist,"" Aly further elaborates, ""working in advertising.  I'd love to find some other way to apply it, or to learn more -- just for the sake of learning more.  I kinda decided to work straight out of school, 'cause I had this really sweet job -- and I might stick with it, because I'm good at it.  But it'd be nice to know if I could do more.""  She looks around, finding the nearest table so she can lean against it, hip-shot and with arms crossed.  ""You look a lot like someone I know,"" she finally explains.  ""And if you're adopted...""  She shrugs.

Alex nods to her artistic urges and then as she moves, he moves with her, only to the end of the stack so that he too may have his back to a surface, not to lean particularly, but to just be back against something and when she finds familiarity in him, he doesn't discount it, but says, ""I may be related to someone, but eah, who knows. I'm Alex Masters by the way, I teach here at Emerson.""

""Teacher,"" Aly says with a sigh -- that has nothing to do with Alex at all, really.  ""Of course you are.  I'm Alyssa Carter, but pretty much everyone calls me Aly.""  The teenager purses her lips for a moment, as if thinking, then asks slowly -- and more quietly, ""Have you ever heard of Xavier's School?""  He is not exactly a 'gifted youngster,' so she leaves taht bit out.

With her question, there's a slight look of confusion on Alex's face and then as it breaks, he gives a chuckle only to respond, ""More often than you'd know... do you attend that school?"" in a quieter voice.

""Went to work straight out of school,"" Alyssa reminds, without actually answering his question.  ""You've heard of it before, though?  From people, or--""  There's a moment of hesitation, a pained look that crosses her face before she continues, ""the news, and the papers?""

""Oh, my bad, I thought you were implying you went there. But yeah. I've run into a few people from it, even Xavier. And ya can't get away from the media."" Alex notes with a slight shake of his head and an almost frustrated tone with some ordeal.

""You know Xavier?""  This is a point in his favor!  She looks around the room casually, then leans forward and looks him dead in the eye.  When she's sure he's paying attention, her pupils contract into vertical slits, and a nearly-clear inner eyelid slides up to mute the brilliant green of her eyes.  She holds for a heartbeat, then two, then blinks her eyes back to normal.  ""Shoulda asked where I'd got to high school.""

As she draws near, Alex doesn't flinch. However, when her pupils shift his own eyes widen a touch and parting his lips he inhales a quick, quiet breath. More astonishment than shock. Then he smiles and says quietly, ""Now that's a definite give-away.""

""School was good for me,"" Aly explains, ""I can do it at will now, instead of just all the time, and it doesn't happen on its own unless I'm really freaked out.""  At this close, it's easier to tell that her pupils aren't /quite/ truly round, but not enough to draw undue attention to them otherwise.  She pulls back, and tips her head to one side.  ""You remind me of one of the professors there, in the--"" she makes sketchy motions to indicate his face.

Alex considers slightly as she implies that he looks like someone, especially that particular someone may be a mutant also. ""So this professor, is he a mutant?"" 

Alyssa settles for hopping up on the edge of her table, legs swinging slightly.  ""Sure,"" she says, then looks around.  ""But now's probably not the best time -- I should be going.  Um.""  She digs a pocket-sized sketchbook and pencil out of her pocket, flips to a blank page, and scribbles something down.  ""That's my cell number.  If you ever want to talk ... things.  Gimme a call, okay?""

Taking the paper, Alex nods slightly and says, ""I will, and thanks."" Retracting it he'll move to put it into his back pocket. With that, he'll grab his bag and say, ""Until then.""

Alyssa hops off her table, and offers Alex a wave in passing as she makes her way through the stacks, and eventually out the door.

<LJ-CUT TEXT=""'The illusions of the young!' [Xavier, Havok]"">

7/31/2007

The afternoon has dawned bright and hot, and the search for air conditioning is the order of the day, for those less inclined to stretch out in bikinis and shorts on the manicured lawns. In the bookstore, filtered air runs cold and strong; it bites through fabric and gnaws at skin, nibbling its way into bloodstreams and summer fever. There are few enough students in the store to appreciate it, beyond those browsing for supplies for the last weeks of the semester. Of adults, there is at least one formidable one.

Clad with propriety and elegance in a grey suit and blue tie, Professor Charles Xavier makes his way down the aisles in his wheelchair, accompanied by the solemn blond viking that serves as his attache. The deep-set gaze explores the stacks with mild interest, academic curiosity skating across the spines of books and, upon occasion, pausing on one. ""Ah,"" he says, plucking one off the shelves. ""How extraordinary. I haven't seen this in years.""

Walking through the stacks, Alex Masters carries three books, one of which he's half opened flipping through pages making sure he wants to buy it before he actually does. All three books are supplimental texts on Geology. Currently Alex wears jeans, hiking boots, a nice T shirt that's blue in color and has the 90's hair do that is inclined to him rolling out of bed and not brushing it. 

For the most part, Alex isn't watching where he's going but he's not in any hurry, so when he rounds the corner to be confronted by a viking an a man in a wheel chair, he's taken off guard, more by the viking than the man. His eyes are pulled from his book as it closes and he says, ""Oh, excuse me."" as he is only feet from collision coming to a full stop.

The tall young man is broad-shouldered and muscled, handsome in a quiet way, capable in a visible one. The blue eyes glance across Alex, immediately assessing; a silent intelligent moves behind them, skating across the other young man with immediate suspicion before veiling their expression in a glance at Xavier.

The Professor, his attention split between the back of the textbook and the abrupt apology, turns a distracted smile at Alex. It is the polite expression used in such casual encounters: civility without an invitation to intimacy. ""Not at all,"" he says, courteously. ""I'm afraid that I've rather blocked this aisle. If you will give me a moment, I can make a path.""

Alex takes note of the viking's expression but is distracted by Xavier's words. Looking down at the man within the wheel chair, it only takes Alex a fraction of a second to identify him - which causes him to stand up straighter and become somewhat anxious or disturbed. Mental images within his own mind quickly cover photographs of the school, Xavier, Jean, Kitty, Emma, Cassy, Andre, and Monet. Not all because he associates them being mutants, but they're the path he's followed to where he is currently, all starting with that school. And for a moment Alex would rather just distance himself as he says, ""It's all good, I can go around."" - In a brief second, Alex is all about turning and walking around, but then slows and turns back to the professor and asks, ""You're Charles Xavier, aren't you?"" - He already knows the answer, but it's just a way for him to start off this conversation.

The Professor settles the book in his lap, age-cramped hands folding gracefully over its cover. Eyes darkened by shadow turn thoughtfully onto Alex; behind them, disciplined shields shore up their walls, thickening in the wake of that barrage of imagery. ""Indeed,"" he says. His baritone is deep and cultured, Shakespearean in its richness and its malleable beauty. ""You have identified me correctly. I fear you have me at a disadvantage, Mister--?""

""Alex Masters. PhD in Geophysics. I teach here at Emerson."" He leans forward after shifting the books into his left hand and offers his right in greeting. ""What brings you all this way from your institute? Surely the books at this store cannot compare to the volumes you may possess.""

""Dr. Masters, then,"" Xavier amends, inclining his head in acknowledgement. Light spits off the dome of his skull, tracing its smooth curve into the hollow of nape and sagging jaw. ""I was here as a guest lecturer for Dr. Mitzger's civil liberties class. As I had some time remaining in my schedule, I thought perhaps to investigate the bookstore. I have fond memories of university bookstores,"" he adds, mildly. ""Although they come from a different generation, of course.""

There is some fear Alex is confronting by talking to Xavier. And he's still torn as to why he's even doing it. His eyes identify with the topic of civil liberties and there's regret in his tone when he says, ""I'm sorry I missed your lecture, it would have been an honor to hear you speak. I'll say though, those fond memories of university bookstores wouldn't have anything to do with the prices of books here. I've often felt that half my tutition went to paying for just the books."" He tries to make a joke at the expense of the bookstore while reaching mentally for the right words that he wants to convey. So he just juts it out there, ""I met Doctor Grey a few weeks back, charming woman, brilliant."" - He's going somewhere, but he's not sure where.

Nor is Professor Xavier. He attends patiently nonetheless, his expression inquiring. More familiar friends would recognize that hint of blandness in it: the tiny signs that the bulk of his attention has moved elsewhere, though his mask of civility is honed by decades. ""An opinion that I certainly sympathize with,"" he says gravely, humorously, answering the thought that he can at least share: Charles Xavier has never winced at the price of a /book/. ""I will be happy to pass along your greetings, if you like. Did you encounter her at Emerson?""

Lowering his left hand which still supports the books that he carries, Alex tends to motion with this right hand as he talks, gesturing with palm open and up. ""Actually no. It was in Salem Center, when I was up there investigating possible tectonic activity. She informed me that it was a mutant at your school that caused a local earthquake."" His index finger touches just above his right brow, amost scratching as his head slightly tilts. ""And since then I've been pondering.."" he looks right and left, seeing if anyone is close to hear what he has to say - identifying the coast is clear, he returns his eyes back to the professor and says, ""...to come and speak with her about my."" He pauses, not really sure how to say 'mutation'.

The Professor's eyebrows lift, inquiring. Inviting. It is Alex's decision to say the word: not his. 

""Mutation."" - There, he said it. Somewhere in him he's a little relieved with all of it. And with Xavier being involved with that school, perhaps Alex is safe in his mentioning of it.

""Ah,"" says Xavier, his attention focusing sharply on Alex at last, and stretches out with a small nudge of power to envelop them in privacy. A student bumbling down the crossing aisle swerves abruptly, drawn by a hitherto undiscovered passion for botany, and disappears to investigate a book of photographs down a different row. ""I see. You are certainly welcome to come and speak with her if you like. She has office hours. As do many of the other members of my staff. Our doors are -- usually open, barring security.""

With a slight frown and a shrug, Alex notes, ""Yeah, that's just it. I wasn't so sure it was good for my career. You know, blacklisting because I'm a mutant or even going to that place and being associated. So I've been rather reticent in making an appointment."" His thoughts are mostly concerned with being outed as a mutant and losing his job. He surely feels that the government is watching the location and if he were to walk up to the gates, he'd be marked.

Xavier's mouth curves slightly. ""An understandable concern,"" he allows, ""and there is certainly cause for it. A regrettable fact of life, I'm afraid, though Emerson is not so intolerant as all that, I believe. Nonetheless -- there are other ways to speak to Dr. Grey. While I cannot speak for her, necessarily, she has made appointments to meet in public, or in neutral territory, as it were. I'm certain she can find some method that would be acceptable to you both.""

Relieved, Alex nods thoughtfully and likes the words he's heard. He notes, ""Thank you sir. I mean, not like anything happened here, but you know. It's sort of a relief. I'll finally have the opportunity to better understand myself and what I can do."" He's talking like Jean will be able to tell him everything, he knows she's psychic and figures she will have all the answers. 

The illusions of the young! Xavier does not persuade him otherwise. ""If it would not make you uncomfortable, Dr. Masters,"" he murmurs with a delicate courtesy. ""Might I ask exactly what--?"" He leaves the question open, one hand gesturing at the younger man. 

""From what I can gather."" He pauses to glance around again, ""It's a form of firey plasma that I can emit. Very destructive and I have problems controlling it. Rather, I sort of have to discharge it every 16 to 24 hours. Or else I'll have a meltdown."" The imagery there in his mind is graphic, he visualizes things he's destroyed, cars, boulders, holes in the ground, etc.

""Ah,"" Professor Xavier says, and blinks. And adds with a mildness of voice that exacerbates understatement: ""How inconvenient.""

Alex takes that as humor and he smiles with a slight chuckle and nod, ""Oh yeah, really gets in the way of taking a cruise or long flights at inconvient times.""

""I can certainly imagine,"" the Professor says wryly, his pale gaze -- blue-tinged, a color caught from his tie -- regarding Alex with the harmless benevolence of an old man regarding a younger generation. Deceptive cover, that; telepathy ghosts across bared surface thoughts and emotions, recording knowledge to feed a sharp curiosity. ""How do you deal with this overflow currently? In a city as crowded as this one, surely there is a risk of discovery.""

""Sewer system."" He shakes his head with a slight cringe, wrinkling his nose, ""Not the nicest smell in the world, that or head down to brighton beach and hope no one is watching while I discharge it under water.""

The Professor's face registers humorous approval at this solution. ""I imagine the CDC would be rather grateful at the sterilization,"" he says with a dry note to his deep voice, ""given the sort of effluvium that finds its way to the sewer system. I daresay it is not necessary for me to warn you to be careful? Noxious though the tunnels are, there is a significant homeless population that uses portions of them as homes.""

Alex registers a new angle on it. ""I took a gas detector down with me to avoid the whole methane so I wouldn't blow myself up, but didn't see anyone right off hand. I'll be sure to check it out more clearly next time."" It would not be good to run into morlocks or what ever else lives down there.

Or simple, homeless homo sapiens. ""I am sure,"" Xavier says in a tone of voice that does not brook argument, ""that you do not intend to cause harm to anyone. An ounce of prevention, as the old saying goes-- but I will not belabor the point. I trust you know how to reach Dr. Grey? If you would prefer not to contact the school, you can always reach her at her laboratory in the city.""

""I do and I will."" Alex notes in the future of contacting Dr Grey. ""Thanks for your time sir."" He notes in realizing that it's best to close this conversation and move on before he realizes that he could be damaging the ozone too.

A matter for later consideration. For the time being, Xavier inclines his head politely, cordially, a smile once more warming his face. It is somewhat more friendly than the original specimen. ""Of course,"" he murmurs, while the Nordic assistant stirs and plants possessive hands on the handles of the Professor's wheelchair. ""It has been a pleasure, Dr. Masters. I hope all goes well for you in the future. I will look forward to meeting you again someday.""

Giving a nod and a ""Good day sir."", Alex moves on heading toward the exit and where to pay with his left arm and an IOU for his first born.

<LJ-CUT TEXT=""'Stop Plate Tectonics' [Andre, Alex]"">

7/16/2007

In an age where food increasingly becomes an experimental art form and movies propose that Anyone Can Cook and be a genius at it, Andre Harrison is still sitting in an IHOP. The percussionist, dressed in suitably casual jeans and a t-shirt that says 'Stop Plate Tectonics,' occupies one bench of a booth, facing the door and sipping coffee slowly. Menus, still closed, lay in the of the table.

From the door, crossing the room, Alex Masters comes strolling. Wearing hiking boots, jeans and a non discript t-shirt blue in color, he approaches and says, ""Dude, your mom musta given you that shirt."" with a broad smile of humor at the subject matter.

""Nah,"" Andre responds to the conjecture with a grin. ""I saw one of her coworkers wearing one at Cal, and I /asked/ her where I could get one. She found it, but I had to pay for it still."" He gestures at the empty booth bench. ""How's it going?""

Taking a seat across from Andre, Alex offers the glad hand in greeting, ""It's great bro. Your mom sends her best. So how you been?"" 

Andre shakes the offered hand, his grip firm but the shake easy and relaxed. ""She's probably trying to get me back to Berkeley sooner than later. I guess I'm just foolishly waiting for that plane ticket price to drop a liiittle bit more."" With his other hand, he indicates an empty cup and the trademark IHOP blue coffee pitcher. ""I'm doing pretty well - orchestra's been good, and it's good to have the summer off from all the morning rehearsals."" He sips his own coffee. ""What brings you to New York? Kind of less geology here than many places.""

Letting out a scoff with a slight roll of his eyes, Alex answers the latter of Andre's statement, ""Dude... So I'm down in Peru working a dig for some archeologist when I get a wire from your mom telling me that there was tectonic activity up here in New York. So, since things were wrapping up down there, and it'd been like 5 years since I've been in the states, I jumped on a plane. Took me a little bit, but finally found out what was going on. There's this mutant school up in Salem Center. They've got a mutant that was shaking the earth. Even got to meet this Dr Jean Grey who told me all about it. Sorta some mutant celebrity in her own right. Well, after a few days of floundering and not having another job to run off to, I ran into this lady, Emma Frost who pointed me toward Emerson University, she told me I should try to get a job there, did, and well, that's where I'm working for at least the next year.""

As soon as Alex describes mutant earthshakers confirmed by Jean Grey, some of the casual conversational relaxation hardens out of Andre's expression, in the form of raised eyebrows, widened eyes, and a slightly opened mouth. He anxiously taps a few fingers against the side of his coffee cup, which produces no sound. ""Some/one/ caused that quake in the winter?"" Surprise rings clear in his tone. ""I read about it in the paper, it shook Manhattan pretty good, but they said /not/ to worry about that kind of thing. 128th Street Fault, they said...""

Leaning back after his story Alex is pleased to have gotten that all off his chest, just because it's good to talk to someone he knows about this crazy world they all live in. He nods, ""Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking, 128th, but the USGS showed nothing going on with it, and now I'm convinced it was mutant related. Totally jacked up that someone would have such power."" - he's missing the Winter aspect of it all, to him this was more recent and local to Westchester county, but he's putting them all together since he's been out of touch with local and recent events (due to being in Peru).

""Well, if Dr. Grey told you so herself,"" Andre begins slowly, but the speed of his words contracts to something more normal as he continues, ""I don't think she'd make it up. She's been open about the school, and her own thing..."" Speaking of tremors, Andre's still speaking /with/ a small one. ""It's not really the kind of thing you'd think to make up..."" His fingers continue to tap against his coffee cup, and he looks at them for a few seconds before abruptly looking back at Havok, swallowing deeply before he asks, ""You going to, um. Get this guy to help you study how the, um, waves work? So people don't have to wait for the next real one?""

Alex isn't really following what Andre is saying, but he figures Andre is wondering if Alex will follow up with the study, ""Nah, I'm done with it. No good can come of getting in the middle of mutant affairs. I'm just gonna hang out at Emerson, teaching Geology or Geophysics, or do a little research if they want me to, and when my contract is up, I'll see where the wind takes me.""

Andre does not exactly have the best way with words when he's startled. As Alex pushes the subject away from Westchester's newly-acquired seismicity, though, some of the tension drains from Andre's posture, and his fingers stop their springloaded-but-silent tapping, now lifting the cup so he can take another sip of coffee. Once he swallows, his smile widens again. ""But seriously. Congrats on landing a job like that! I hear all these stories about people ending up being professors in someplace in the total middle of nowhere, but Emerson's a /good/ deal, especially if they let you run the course on your own syllabus rather than some 101-level rigid plan.""

After a slight interruption of ordering and getting a glass of water, Alex notes in return, ""Thanks bro. Emerson seems like a great place, but I'm way too cloistered there. Hell, I've not lived in a city for years, I already miss my wide open spaces, the desert. But you're right, I'm pretty lucky to have gotten such a cushy position. I think it goes back to that Frost chick, she's got some pull it seems. So what about you, what about this orchestra stuff. Are you doin any individual work, like some Beatles cover band or something on the wild side?"" 

Andre orders as well, then refills his coffee from the blue pitcher. He doesn't sip yet, though, but rather rubs the thumb and forefinger of the hand not holding the cup over his temples, snorting quietly and grinning. ""Oh ma-an, mom told you about the band, huh?"" He lowers his hand. ""We're pretty bad,"" the term is uttered affectionately, ""but it's a blast. So's the orchestra, and I'm thinking of maybe trying to pick up some private students if time permits - which it should, considering I still waste plenty of time on the internet!"" He shrugs and sips his coffee after all. ""And hey, if you stay at the university long enough and teach well, I'd bet they'll have you off doing field work and research and stuff. Maybe you can convince them to let you take a class to, I dunno, poke at faults.""

Alex smiles broadly, having shown his hand but proud of it. He kicks back a bit and nods at the poking at faults remark, ""I'd be totally down with that. Do a 6 week trip with a class of fresh minds anywhere would be great just about now. But tell me, where do yall play, got a gig or something going, I mean if I ever find some chick to take out that'd be a great date.""

""I'd be up for a trip like that, too. Change of pace and stuff. Though I'd pretty much guarantee you'd get no actual quakes if I went along."" Andre tips his chin down toward his shirt, then adds, a little more quickly than his previous speech, ""With my luck."" He looks back up and returns to his normal speech, ""You asking about the band or the orchestra?""

Not catching onto emotional or visual clues, Alex more or less brushes off any hints of reservation from Andre, he chalks it up to that the East Coast has affected the guy. Regardless, Alex notes, ""Either, but band would be more fun.""

Andre is still less East Coast than most! Or so he'd like to think. He squints toward the ceiling at the question, considering, ""Well, for the orchestra, I can tell you pretty much exactly where and when, but the band's far more sporadic. We had this gig on Halloween in Westchester last year, but I don't know if that was for a theme thing or what. They seemed to like us, at any rate, so I'm hoping it could be a repeatable venue.""

""Dude, it'll probably take till Halloween before I even meet a girl I want to hang out with. So I'll be all over it."" Alex notes with some interest in the whole 'seeing the band play' stuff. Aside from any of that, he's one to go into talking about Berkeley when he mentions, ""I've not seen a live concert since Berkeley. Speakin of, I know it ain't a money issue with you heading back, when you gonna get out to visit your mom?"" - Alex is adopted, so family is one of those things that mean a lot to him <andre would know about the adoption part>.

Andre laughs quietly, promising, ""I'll keep you posted on that, then!"" He shifts slightly in his seat, then brushes his hair back from his forehead and scratches idly behind one ear as he considers, ""Professional musician pay is hardly enough to be taking trips around the country and world! Though I'm looking at late August or early September. If anything, dad's been hoping to get me back there even sooner.""

""Well, I'm sure it'll all work out."", Alex notes in a supporting tone, hoping that Andre will get back to see his mom - mostly because Alex admires Dr Harrison. Then the conversations flow to topics of what either has been doing for the past years, humorous and light.

<LJ-CUT TEXT=""'Honestly? No, it is a discussion of my bizarre ability to draw men toward me who seem to think that they are funny, in spite of having the wit of a particularly slow pet rock.' [Monet, Havok]"">
7/9/2007

=NYC= Mason Quad - Emerson University

This area serves as the main quad for the college, although other, smaller ones dot the campus. Several species of trees planted here lend their aesthetic beauty to the wide expanse of grass, as well as providing shade on the warmer days for students who opt to do their studying outside. A few benches are positioned here and there, but most choose to simply flop into the bright green grass underfoot.

A number of buildings exit out onto the Quad, including Parker Hall, which is quaint and squat compared to other buildings located on the campus. Its landscaping consists mostly of tulips and cherry trees while the interior is slightly more modern and stylized. Within, Health Services and the admissions office can be found.
__________

Wearing hiking boots, jeans, a red t shirt, and slinging a backpack of black leather, Alex Masters walks across the quad holding a map in his right hand while slowing to glance around at the features of the area. Various students pass doing their own thing and he seems as if he's slightly lost.

Still riding high on the wave of celebrity in the wake of her return to civilization after roughly a month on an island in the South Pacific in the wake of a plane crash, Monet St. Croix is walking the quad for no reason other than to be seen. Her designer jeans are matched with a Beatles t-shirt. Coincidence guides her in the man with the map's direction, confidence oozing off of the young woman with every step. As she comes nearer, she eyes him speculatively, slowing a bit.

In his right hand, Alex holds that map and reorients it to the location he is within (north to north, building to building). As he does he gains a understanding look on his face as if he's realized where and how to go. He looks across the quad to his target then in his return to his own space, he catches the gaze of the girl, he smiles making a joke of it, ""You'd think they tossed the buildings up in the air and where they fell, they left them.""

Monet responds dryly to the joke. ""No, I wouldn't think that. I would think you likely cannot read a map."" There is a tiny hint of faded French in her accent, but nothing thick at all. With a sigh as if she were being truly tortured, she comes to a complete halt. ""What building are you looking for?""

Alex develops a slight smile on his face as he realizes something very quickly about this girl, he blows it off and says, ""Yeah, that's totally it. I get lost going from my front door to my car. Hell, I even ended up at the local Quicky Mart having to ask directions from Apu to find my left foot so I could tie my shoe. But I got the building. Thanks for your generous offer to help out.""

During Alex's rant, Monet narrows her eyes slowly. After another sentence or two, her lips push into a tight little smirk. ""I am glad you have that delightfully subtle sense of sarcasm to see you through your troubles, then."" A hand moves to her hip, resting there in a little fist. ""Do you have any other humor you would like to bludgeon me with?""

He nods with an assured answer as he offers, ""Yeah, those shoes you're wearing, Ellen Degeneres was wearing that same style last year."" Alex smiles, as he folds the map, sure he's about to be on his merry way.

Instead of rising to this insult, Monet peers down at her shoes. ""Really? I am scheduled to appear on her show Wednesday. Would you like me to pass along your compliments on her taste in shoes?"" The arrogance in claiming this is thick enough that her words drip.

""Really?"", Alex asks with enthusiasm, ""Is this the episode where you find out that your baby's daddy is really your brother who was thought long lost? Or do you find out that you were really born a guy?""

""Honestly? No, it is a discussion of my bizarre ability to draw men toward me who seem to think that they are funny, in spite of having the wit of a particularly slow pet rock."" Monet smiles sweetly with this, ""Do you usually walk around trying to pick fights with women?""

Alex places the map in his back pocket after it's been folded. His eyes maintain in hers, never flenching, this is a lot of fun to him, he's not had a good fight in months. ""Nah, I don't pick fights with women, just spoiled little girls pretending to be ladies. What about you, always start off a conversation with an insult?""

Monet rolls her eyes, looking up toward the sky. ""And surely, you are the authority upon what makes a lady. A man who does not have the social manners of a gnat."" She lets out a haughty laugh, that tight-lipped smirk returning. ""Are you always so sensitive that you cannot handle a woman teasing you without flying off off the handle?"" Her eyes fall very blatantly to Alex's crotch. ""What in the world are you compensating for?""

Alex smiles and shakes his head slightly, ""Nothing to see there, move along. It's tiny. I'm totally over compensating. Tell me though, did you learn those exceptional manners of yours at the School for the Social Bitch? Or do they just come natural?""

Shaking her head slowly, Monet laughs as she raises a hand to her forehead. With her fingertips resting upon her temples, her laughs takes on a definite tone of pity. ""It seems to me, my dickless friend, that you are incapable of comprehending the concept of dry humor. You made a joke and I was attempting to return it in kind. Instead, you have proven to be so bafflingly brainless that you've started slinging insults."" She lowers her hand, lifting her gaze once more. ""Just what are you out to prove? That you can browbeat a girl into submission? Is this some horrible attempt at flirting with me? If I am sure to tell the other girls at my table at lunchtime that you're kind of cute, will you go away?""

""Yeah, you're right, personal foul, five yards. My bad."" Alex retracts with a smile, he's enjoyed the fight sofar, but now she's turning it into something else, ""But you're way off base, this ain't flirting, this is entertainment. I've not had a good fight in months, it's too bad you're turning it into a boy versus a girl thing.""

Monet sighs heavily, her eyes once more rolling. ""Would you be more intensely satisfied if I were to punch you in the jaw?"" She eyes him, as if she were considering this as a potential course of action.

""Not at all. Are you saying you have some pent up aggression issues that make you want to punch me?"" Alex asks as he slips his thumbs into the corners of his pockets.

""I spent an entire month trapped on a desert island with a dozen other people, one of whom was the most intolerable bitch I have ever met in my entire life, including myself,"" Monet explains. ""I have enough pent up aggression that I considered, briefly, ripping Larry King's suspenders off in mid-interview and attacking his crew with them."" There is a shade of a grin this time. Monet is, in fact, trying to be funny.

""You shoulda done it, just out of principle. Suspenders and bow ties... what is he thinking, this isn't 1984."" Alex grins, offering some levity to her remark. 

Monet waves a hand upward with this, fingers wiggling airily. ""The man is clearly some sort of a robot. He serves no purpose but to prechew news for those who cannot bother doing something like reading a newspaper for themselves."" She lets out a heavy sigh, the sound of someone long tortured. ""I do deeply hope that the Degeners woman you invoked earlier isn't so..."" She looks downward at her own chest. ""Inclined to staring.""

Alex pauses a second before saying something, he's seeing how this island adventure that the girl mentioned isn't some made up story and he says, ""Hang on a minute, you're serious about all this. You were trapped on some island? And we ain't talking Gilligans, right?""

The exhasperation she has been to quick to jump to does not appear this time. That she likes the attention is a very safe bet. ""Do you follow the news at all?"" She asks, then without waiting for an answer, clarifies anyway. ""I was on United Flight 839, the plane that went down a couple of months ago? 365 or so people were killed."" There is a very genuine touch of sorrow to the death toll, but she tries to bury it.

""Oh crap, that's jacked up. I've been out of the States, missed it. But that's really bad, so are you cool, I mean, like you know."" Alex isn't sure how to approach this subject, he's never been exposed to such a tragedy, other than his own plan wreck some years back that he doesn't even remember to any degree of clarity. So he'll be struggling with the subject matter and trying to be sensitive.

""I am entirely fine. Myself and the other survivors were only minorly injured. One woman broke her arm, I had a very unsightly gash on my back, things of that nature."" Monet chuckles, though the laughter is not humorous at all. ""The discomfort came to an end, largely, when we were found. It was, however, the most interesting trip to Australia I have ever taken. Sydney is different when photographers and cameramen chase you around.""

Alex doesn't want to pry, as he doesn't even know who this girl is, so he leaves it at that, ""Well, cool, glad you're alright and stuff."" Still, little tact in his choice of words, but he's a guy and conveying a 'sensitive' message and showing said aspect of his personality. ""Oh, by the way, I'm Alex."" he offers trying to step away from her inner stuff.

""Monet St. Croix,"" she counters. She even goes so far into politeness as to offer her hand out to him. For some reason, there is a tiny, tiny smirk on her lips.

Pulling his latched thumb from his pocket, Alex takes her welcoming hand and says, ""Good to meet ya. I'd better be goin, got an appointment with a dean. Maybe we'll fight again.""

She is a very strong young woman, Monet is. She squeezes down on Alex's hand with force far beyond what her fairly slender arms should be able to produce, but she is not trying to do any real damage. ""Maybe we will, Alex. Give the dean that line about Ellen Degeneres and the shoes,"" she advises as she relinquishes her grip and turns to walk away.

With a smile, he lets her go and Alex walks away rubbing his hand reflecting on her strength for about 8 more seconds before his attention span wanders.

"event","It took some processing and lots of situating. But I'm finally settled. Dropping that Emma chick's name got me in square with this Emerson place. Seems I'll be taking up some light teaching and learning of their system for the rest of the summer and then full bore this Autumn. I secured a place just down the street, something temporary till I can get all my finances in order and have time to look around. It's not like I have much stuff to put anywhere, so I won't need much, but still, it'd be nice to have a solid roof and a bed that's not rolled out on a rocky ground.

I've not really had time to get to know anyone, but I've met several staff members and seen some students - all in passing. This university will be a nice change of pace and will give me some stability. I didn't realize how much I missed some 'stability'. Now it's just time."

She approached me in some bar up in Salem Center, started being all chatty, then said if I happened to be looking for a job that I should go to this place, Emerson University, down in Queens. I'm all about a new job, and teaching or research may be an option. So, I'm headed down there, the chancellor is the one I should speak to and drop her name, then I'll be in like Flint.

<LJ-CUT TEXT=""'That woman is /everywhere/ - Emma commenting about Jean Grey' [Emma Frost, Alex Masters/Summers]"">

6/25/2007

=WES= Harry's Bar - Salem Center

An old tavern that stands from Revolutionary Times, Harry's is a common hide-away place for humans and mutants alike, although surprisingly quite a bit of the latter can be found, for all of the owner's devil-may-care attitude towards them. Modestly furnished in dark woods, it holds a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere that appeals to many, although almost never crowded. Up against one wall stretches the bar itself with several red leather barstools stationed in front of it and an impressive selection, behind the counter. Most of the rest of the room, however, is occupied by a few tables and booths, for people to dine at. Definitely not any kind of white-collar establishment, but the company it keeps is good.

There is nothing unusual about cars in Salem Center, not even shiny black SUVs. Most don't have a driver, however, and most aren't pulled into the little hole in the wall that is the local institution of Harry's Bar. Inside, it's not difficult to figure out who it belongs to, even if Emma has opted for casual wear. Her choice of casual wear isn't especially casual. Loose, wide-legged sailor-style pants and a sleeveless tank top, and all in white, is asking for trouble and dirt in Harry's. Despite the usual lunchtime crowd, she's alone at the end of the bar, staring down at a basket of Harry's chili fries. You'll love them, promise!

Through the door, Alex enters. He wears his standard jeans, hiking boots, a cotton pull over tshirt and a light colored sport coat. He's not really dressed up, more dressed down. His hair is also all over the place, early morning rolled out of bed, the comb was frightened off 'do'. Taking a seat toward the middle of the bar, Alex has already noticed the blond, hard not to. He's a guy. What else is there to know.

Emma is used to the noticing, and at the moment, trying to ignore the majority of it. Besides, those fries are only getting soggier the longer she stares at them. So much for fits of nostalgia. She crinkles her nose and takes a bite of one. Hmm. Ok. Her attention finally drifts to the younger man.

A few words play through his mind, (wow, senic in this town, this is why I missed the States, Dr Jean who, amazing body). And then he's interrupted by the voice of the waitress asking what she can get him. He has been in here before - he orders a burger, fries, and a soft drink.
Yes. Yes. Shit. Yes. That woman is /everywhere/. Something familiar niggles at the back of her mind, but it is dismissed in favor of scowling at her basket of fries. She gives up and pushes them to the side, towards Alex. ""Take these. Please.""

From the corner of his eye, Alex notices the movement of the blonde and looks that way, his mind asks what, but his lips say, ""Cheese Fries?"" as his eyes cross over them and then into hers.

""Chili-cheese. Apparently someone"" she looks behind the bar accusingly at the waiter on duty, ""thinks these are good."" She slides off her stool and walks the basket the two seats over to climb back on the seat net to him.

""I'm sure they're chocked full of the 7 recommended daily vitamins and minerals, plus a ton of yummy goodness. Alex Masters is my name."" He swivels in his chair to face her and welcome her into his personal space.

She's sure he does welcome her. ""Masters... Any connection to the New England Masters?"" Emma examines the bar before reaching across him, ""Excuse me"", to the napkin dispenser and pulling a handful free. One is spread on the bar, and her elbow laid atop it.

Shaking his head, ""More like the Masters of Nebraska, I'm sure you've heard of them, they invented boredom, strife, and a terrible childhood. Luckily I'm adopted. So, you've got to have a great name."" In his tiny little male brain, he's going over how out of the ordinary it is for someone so amazing to look at has even started up a conversation with him. Ultimately Alex views himself with less opinion than others may, probably due to his 'adoptive status', perhaps because he was always a geek at heart, loves rocks, or that girls just don't approach him. Either way, there's some lovely specimen of a woman in front of him and he's trying to be cool.

Emma laughs on cue and hooks a foot onto the rung of his stool. ""Maybe we were long-distance neighbors."" Elsewhere around the room, others are discretely staring. Apparently, he's not the only one wondering.

Alex lends a smile and his elbow goes upon the bar leaning a little to the side putting weight on it while staying engaged. His mind wonders why she didn't answer his question, but it's just more of a challenge, he's also curious about her, so he follows through with the next question, ""Well, if we were in college, I'd ask, 'what's your major', but since we're out in the real world, I'll ask, ""What do you do and where do you do it?""""

""I'm in business,"" she answers coyly. ""Am I to take it that you're /not/ a college student then? What do /you/ do, Mr. Masters?""

""Geologist. Graduated Berkeley a few years back, been out of the States helping with various digs and some archaeologist buddies. Ended up coming back on the notion from a colleague that suggested there may be some tectonic activity up here, turns out it was something else."" He sort of quietens down with his last words while he thinks, (Whoops, may have said too much, no association with that place, no blacklist, need a job. Why am I still in this town if I'm not going to go to visit that school, am I really trying to live out some self fulfilling prophesy?)

""Tectonic activity? Really?"" Emma shows genuine surprise at the information. His thoughts filter easily through thinned shields. ""If it was something else, what do you plan on doing now?"" She crosses her legs, the one still on the rung, and her other foot swinging idly near his leg.

There's no pause in his voice as he answers, ""No idea, probably hit the net and look up the help wanted ads for geologists, there's actually a pretty nice network to help out the consulting or contract geologist."" Though, in his mind, he goes through questions, not full sentences, but most revolve around going to the school and asking Dr Grey for her help with his power, and then flashes to a slab of granite that he obliterated with a plasma discharge from his hands. He tries to get away from the topic at hand though, he doesn't want to sound too much like a 'guy between jobs', AKA, a loser. ""You married?"" is asked, out of nowhere, trying to find a new topic.

Emma rolls her eyes skywards as if in thought and drums her fingernails against her kneecap. ""Well... If things don't work out for you there, you might try Emerson. Teaching or research. I do have some pull there..."" Mutant. Of course. There are getting to be far too many running around. Really. It's quite ridiculous. The question pulls her attention back to his face and she laughs, lowering her lashes to slant a sly smile at him. ""You really have been out of touch. Why? You interested in the position?""

Suddenly confronted with her final comment and challenge of his question, he offers a lopsided smile and says, ""Oh man, yeah, sorry, that was totally out of left field."" There's a definite anxiousness to get away from that topic in his brain and he notes, ""But I'd be glad to take you up on the pull, I mean, this seems like a nice area and teaching would be a good change. Where's this Emerson place?""

""In the City. Private university. Surprised you haven't heard of them,"" she purrs, shifting forward slightly to pat his knee. ""And don't worry. The answer is no, by the way.""

(Brains and looks with pull, this girl is impressive - definitely out of my league. I must look like a total moron to ask if she's married.) Alex considers while taking in her words and grins at the whole marriage debacle. ""Nah, never heard of it, but then again, most of my life has been about rocks."" (rocks in my head) ""Thanks though, I mean, it's not every day that someone just says, 'Hey, go here if you need a job.'"" And in his head, he meanders over the blacklisting career ending mark that he may already have for associating with Dr Grey and all that mutant stuff.

Emma slides from the stool with a heavy-lidded smile and nods at the waiter, who pulls a receipt from a card machine and slides it over, along with a pen. ""Well, it's not every day that someone propositions me,"" Emma lies sweetly as she signs her name to the charges and pushes the paper back. ""If you do look up Emerson, mention Emma Frost to the chancellor. If you do, I'm sure I'll see you around."" She winks and heads for the door.

He nods, ""Will do."" and as she leaves, Alex doesn't even watch, he just lowers his head in shame shaking it slowly to himself with a hypocritical smile thinking about how much of a moron his mouth can make him look. And to think, he didn't even ask her to marry him, just if she was, shouldn't have even mentioned marriage at all.

"event","After meeting with Dr Grey, I took a walk to the public library to do a little research on the Xavier School and her involvement in it. I know, seems a little stalker-ish. Yeah, I totally agree. But, the whole mutant subject struck a nerve and considering my own dysfunction, I may find information or cause to seek out that school's help to get it under control. Regardless, that's not exactly what this entry is about. 

So, I'm surfing the internet for information and learn very quickly that Dr Grey is a telepath. Oy Vey! . I mean, holy crap. All of the things that were going through my head when talking to her. I'm surprised I didn't get slapped or kicked. Not like I didn't visualize her in compromising positions, but still, commenting aloud that someone is 'hawt' could be considered degrading when that someone has a PhD, MD, and what ever else she's got. Now if that someone is a stripper, that'd be a different story she'd want you to back that hawt comment up with a 20. Still, I'm a total jerkwad. ------------- Well, that's one tree I won't be barking up.

In other news. The school is definitely mutant in nature. There's a few interviews from students and a public announcement or two from the staff. I'm still under the impression that visiting the school, or even associating with them further would be career and social suicide. I do not want to be black listed as a mutant, another reason I've been so careful and far away from this country.

In closing, if I ever encounter Dr Grey again, I'm mentally humming the tune from ""The Girl from Ipanema"" and avoiding those stray thoughts."

I spent most of the morning interviewing random people asking if they had felt the quake or knew anything about it. The information I received last night from the USGS did not pinpoint the seismic activity to anything other than near Breakstone Lake. Since the lake is the result of glacial activity artificial sculpting, then I'm not certain it is anything tectonic in nature. 

In my various interviews, one young woman, Kitty Pryde, seemed initially forthcoming with information and quickly reticent. She however did mention that she would be calling me back after speaking with someone. There were a few others who thought they felt a tremor, but for the most part, people weren't interested in my questions or they claimed to know nothing. I suppose it goes with the territory, I'm an outsider and they don't know me -&nbsp; It's common with small communities. 

There's a nice little no name place hidden away that has this most excellent cherry pie. I'll be going back there this afternoon to try out their peach.

Afternoon - No Tectonics, just Mutants

I received a call from Doctor Jean Grey about the seismic activity - she was the 'people' Kitty was obviously talking about - that's some serious people. She wanted to meet for coffee, so we met at a local coffee place. This is the part where I try to put into words how hawt she is, but seriously, there are no words. So I'll move on. Turns out that she's working at a school called Xaviers. I'd read about this mutant school place some years ago and just now putting one and one together to realize it is the same mutant facility. Anyway, it ended up not being tectonic activity, but some mutant kid with the ability to shake the Earth. 

Well, this is now officially a dead end. Still, I've got to find Andre Harrison, it's been a while and it'll be nice to see what he's up to now days. Afterwards, my schedule is pretty open, maybe I'll see how the States have turned out these past few years. Though, in the back of my mind, I'm inclined on two things, going to the mutant school and seeing about my own abilities - and - seeing if that dr Grey is single. Surely not, but heck, what else do I got going?

Rethought - Hang on, that's just opening a whole can of worms. If I go to that school, surely the government is watching it. Then I may get associated with them and labeled as one. Crap, I'll bet they saw me with Grey. I'll never be able to leave the country now. It may be best to head back to Diablo, least it was quiet out there."

"event","Day 38 - Anderson Expedition - Machu Picchu - Early Morning

I received a telegram from Dr Harrison (a former instructor and colleague of mine from Berkeley). She wrote of seismic activity in the New York State area. She thought I would be interested in the possible tectonic shift. I'm totally interested. This expedition hasn't really used me in over a week and I'm just spinning my wheels down here - good money, but I'm really just bored. So I spoke to Anderson and he was all for releasing me. I'm on the next bus, llama, or bicycle out of here - which ever comes first.

From Cusco to Lima

I've been traveling for just over a day now and I'm just now seeing Lima again. It's been a hard trek. First the bus broke down 4 miles outside of Cusco, everyone unloaded their chickens, goats, and other relics and did the hike. We arrived in Cusco a few hours later and I barely caught the last bus to Lima. Ah, freeways, I sure miss them. I woke as the bus was pulling into the station and was able to catch a flight out of Lima. It'll hop me over to Rio where I can get a trans continental flight up to JFK after a stop in Miami.

Day 1 - New York - 128th Street Fault-line

Customs in Miami was a total pain in the. But I was able to get through without too much of an issue. These security measures are off the hook. And the flight from Miami to JFK wasn't bad at all, actually somewhat roomy. I've managed to secure a hotel room in the city near 128th st and 2nd avenue. I haven't heard anything about the specific location of the earthquakes and just assumed it was in this area. Either way, I'll see about contacting the USGS during regular business hours tomorrow and find out what they know.

-------

Day 2 - New York - 128th Street Fault-line

I contacted the USGS and they've no documentation on recent seismic activity on the 128th fault line but they did list activity north of New York. So I contacted Doctor Harrisson and it turns out that I was misreading the telegram (I was putting words into it that I wanted to hear). Between her and the USGS, I learned that the quake occurred within a community north of the city, Salem Center, Westchester County, New York. She laughed at me because I flew directly here without contacting her. I suppose I was really excited, or just ready to get out of Peru. 

Afternoon

I've reached Westchester County, a small town called Salem Center. I'll be placing a call to Andre (Dr Harrison's son - met him once at Berkeley, good guy) it turns out he's in the region, once I get settled, but first, pie. I've not had a good cherry pie in ages and I'll bet one of these small restaurants will have one."

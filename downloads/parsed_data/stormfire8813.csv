"event","well... first i feel like sharing a song, or rather my faveorite/the most meaningful parts of a few by one of my most favorite bands, The Spill Canvas...

How does it feel to know you're everything I need
The butterflies in my stomach
They could bring me to my knees
How does it feel to know you're everything I want
I've got a hard time saying this
So I'll sing it in a song
Oh I adore the way you carry yourself
With the grace of a thousand angels overhead
I love the way the galaxy starts to melt
~So Much~

And he can't understand
How everyone goes on breathing when true love ends
His mother whispers quietly...
Heaven's not a place that you go when you die
It's that moment in life when you actually feel alive
So live for the moment
And take this advice, live by every word
Love is just a hoax so forget anything that you have heard
And live for the moment now
~The Tide~

My secret is fatally gorgeous
I'd die for you
But in this Bonnie and Clyde kind of romance
Tell me what would you do?
My secret is fatally gorgeous
I'd die for you
But when your precious life is at stake
Tell me would you die for me too?
~Black Dresses ~

So tonight I'll sit and pick apart your pictures
And overanalyze your words
But the truth is that I've never fallen so hard
It's taking everything in me
Just to forget your sweater so far
I can honestly say
That I never, ever, ever felt this way
Your lips, your eyelashes, your skin
These are the parts of your body
That cause my comatose to begin
I will sleep another day
I don't really need to anyway
What's the point when my dreams are infected
With words you used to say
I will breathe in a moment
As long as I keep my distance
I wouldn't want to go messing anything up
So don't go worrying about me
It's not like I think about this constantly
So maybe I do, but that shouldn't affect
Your life anymore
I knew it the moment you walked into the door
I'll let you get the best of me
Because there's nothing else that I do well
I'll let you get the best of me
Because there's nothing else that I do well
I'll be the giver and you'll be the taker
I guess that's how this one's gonna go I'll be the giver and you'll be the taker
You've got me down on my knees and I proclaim
All hail the heartbreaker
~All Hail The Heartbreaker~

You're floating above my head
There are words carved in my chest
And they said...
""Could somebody show me the kind of affection
That you only see in the movies, you know what I mean""
I will suck the elixir from your fingertips
Until I feel my head start caving in
My mouth will overflow with your evil soul
And I'll be convulsing for days in this hole
Bubbling at the lips 
~Your Evil Soul~

ok, now that you have most likely overpassed all that...
~i am updating... yes, at this very moment i am rather sad, because i feel like the guy i like is going to find someone completely amazing, and he will forget about me... i really want to talk to him, but when it comes to this, i am a shy little chicken...
~theres this person... and they really like me... and i dont know what to do... im kindof confused right now...
~school starts in less than a week... oh joy...
~my parents have narrowed it down to 2 houses... im so excited
~so m just sitting here, listening to the sounds of the room, with a sad heart, soon i will be happy again, however currently the thoughts about this guy... they are very confusing, and i should stop thinking them... but i cant
~as cheesy and cliche as this sounds, i wish i could tell him how i really feel about him, like how i would do anything just to hear his voice, to see him, and to talk to him, but most of all... i want him to be happy, as hard as it would be to see him happy with someone else... thats what i want most...
~wow... i am a hopeless romantic

"event","you know how when you lose something you realize how much you took it for granted?

I had a room to myself, my own bathroom, beautiful surroundings, parents to drive me everywhere(even though my dad is a psycho and my mom is over emotional and i want to get away from them but i have them...) and sisters(though one was somewhere in another satate and the other was ... in watertown and such) and i had IM and a place to disappear to when i wanted the whole world to leave me alone... i had it, i was able to stay up on the computer because my parents didnt realize it, i was able to talk to the people i really wanted to when i wanted to... i had a signal(it wasnt the best, but it worked for txt messages) its all gone now...

we were packing, and the house was slowly being taken apart... now people... strangers... are going to move in, my room is no longer mine... theyre gonna kill all the spiders too... but it is no longer my house, it echoed when i was in there last, they move in friday, and where do we go? were at my grandmas right now... and we'll probably be here for a while.

there is one computer that everyone can see, one bathroom with 3 people trying to use it at the same time, i have no room to escape to... where it is mine, and it has my stuff... i have no place to run to when i feel like my world is falling apart... i dont have my music... i dont have a house, or a home... 

our stuff is in a house... one i ddint like at first, but it grew on me... all our stuff is in there and we were ready to settle in... but now we dont even know. my mom literally cant breathe when she is in there, everything is falling apart, i feel like i want to break down... from everything... school, this, people... but i cant, i have nowhere to run to, im right out in the open, no privacy... 

im at my grandmas house, and i know shes trying... but i just want a place to go... a room to call my own, its all so strange...

i just want a house to live in... friends to call without using my grandmas phone, AIM, my camera thing, my iTunes with all MY music, my stereo... with working radio stations, and a cd thing... i just want to go to a house, that is mine...

i also want a pet... not my dogs... a different pet... but that doesnt matter bc ill never get one...

ive been keeping everything to myself... because my friends have told me i just want pity... but you know, it is big to me... i have trouble handling things, biw they think i dont trust them bc i dont tell them... quite frankly... i dont trust most of them... not with my problems... i  need friends, that i can be with... just sit and talk, or watch tv, not feeling like you have to entertain anyone... but that will also never happen...

my dreams have crashed, i dont dream anymore, unless you count getting away from my family... but i dont, i have no dreams... everyone shot them down... i want to cut so badly... but i wont... i cant... i promised... but i want to... 

i guess i want a lot of things... and a few of them are actually material, i could live without some... but i want a house to call my own... and friends... that i can talk to without worrying about whether or not they will say im thrwing a pity party and just want attention... i know i have a few... shannon, sean, dave, liz... but idk... 

even though i know i have friends, and i know im not alone, i just feel so alone... i just feel like nobody cares... i just want a guy that will hold me... not want sex, not care about kissing... just a guy, that i like, and he likes me back, that im comfortable with, and that i see myself with... and... yeah, that one boy... ive just about given up on... sure i like him... i like him a lot... but i just dont care anymore... i just dont know anymore..."

Having your friend stop the ice cream man and you running in looking for all the change in the house

Go back to the time when

Decisions were made by going 'eeny-meeny-miney-moe'.

Mistakes were corrected by simply exclaiming 'do over!'

'Race issue' ment arguing about who ran the fastest.

Money issues were handled by whoever was banker in 'Monopoly'.

It wasn't odd to have two or three 'best' friends.

Being old referred to anyone over 20.

A chance to skate as a couple at the local roller rink was like winning the lottery.

Scrapes & bruises were kissed & made better.

It was a big deal to finally be tall enought to ride the 'big people' rides at the fair.

When playing Nintendo was the hardest thing ever.

When Ninja Turtles ruled the world.

When Lisa Frank was the raddest thing ever.

When a candy bar at the grocery store was the highlight of your day.

When coupons collected all year could get you a prize in your class auction.

When the only thing you cried over was your mom being late to pick you up.

When stress was addition and subtraction.

When friendships were as complicated as who's house to sleep over and who's to TP

You are elegant, withdrawn, and brilliant.
Your mind is a weapon, able to solve any puzzle.
You are also great at poking holes in arguments and common beliefs.

For you, comfort and calm are very important.
You tend to thrive on your own and shrug off most affection.
You prefer to protect your emotions and stay strong.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/worldsshortestpersonalitytest/"">The World's Shortest Personality Test</a></div>"

Not only that but Nadav got a job there in the warehouse and may eventually become a navigator. I don't work at the warehouse very often so I wont be working the same times as him. Prob better that way. School is nearing an end. Have a paper due way too soon and need to get my ass in semiotic gear before Fernando leaves. Fernando being my research supervisor and semiotic being a theory i will use for my paper. A really hard theory. Of course I pick the prof who is a semiotician but hes the besetest. So stress is my life as usual. On the bright side I will be in Europe soon. However that is also a source of stress. We have to figure out if we want to take the train to warsaw and have maciek pick us up or if we want to fly and wander the city for a day til he is done work. Oh, I cut my hair. Short!"

"event","So I got an office job at the warehouse of Mattress Mart. It pays more than at La Vie en Rose....so duh I took it and quit. As most of you know I already walked out of the st laurent lver store cuz of Erica and her evil-ness, meanwhile even though lynsey had a meeting with her and everyone else, nothing has changed...so glad I left. I got transfered back to the Rideau store and Francis seemed happy to have me but more money and a parking lot totally wins. So far I had one shift and it seems it will be fine as soon as I learn the comp system. My new term started. I have class at 8:30 am tomorrow! Ugh! So I ran into hellen and katrina at st laurent and they are just as miserable as ever (girls that worked with me). I gave Hellen the number for my work cuz they are hiring a full time admin person and no reason she cant do it. Nadav showed me some excersises with weights I intend to do. I dont want to build any muscle but it would be nice to just tone up a bit.
SO MUCH READING TO DO!"

I got an A on the presentation so it should balance itself out. We're gonna go out for dinner and drinks tomorrow night to celebrate. I cant drink though cuz of my stomach. Meanwhile my stomach hurts, lots, for about a month now. I'm tired of it...I'm also tired of work, i do not get paid enough to take anything seriously. Our store manager quit so now erica is the ""acting"" and we all know how much I love her. sigh. I'm thinking to try to stick it out til May but if Erica gets promoted to store manager, I'm out!"

Very passionate about what he teaches and knowledgeable but off the wall. He is the spitting image of Samuel L Jackson! I am definetly not interested in becoming as invloved here as i did at webster. maybe that will change but for now...Working at like vie en rose is interesting.

I am going to try to disinfect it but it will probably end in me paying some computer geek (cuz I have all the money in the world). I really need to buy shoes for la vie en rose but considering i have no money (thanks to tuition and car payments and phone bills and good old gas) we'll have to see when i do that.

That means the only part time manager who is responsible for opening and closing and the cash. I'm pretty excited. Its right at St laurent so you cant really get any closer than that. I wonder if I will ever stay at a job longer than 4 months hehehehe. I gave my 2 weeks Monday and Steve was very understanding.

I offered him a ridiculously good price for it and he pretty much told me to fuck off in not so many words. Back to school soon....scary. Got my nails done for the very first time ever.

"event","Went to see Eleanore perform for the first time last friday. Nadav and I decided to make a trip of mtl of it. We had a long weekend so why not. So Im not the hugest fan of her music, kinda jazzy, but she is so talented! Nadav likes the music and wants to buy a cd and all that. I'll buy one to support her but...shes an amazing singer and she wrote all the songs herself which is uber impressive. Saturday we hung out at the old port and then went out. We were supposed to have a barbq in honour of moi but robin was feeling depressed cuz her and anthony just broke up (yes katie, I am extatic about it)so we went out instead. This makes visit 2 that Mike didnt bother showing for anyting. Sunday was shopping day. I discovered a ""gay"" section in HMV. In honour of the outgames of course...not really sure what to say about that. Took Nadav to his first Shakespeare in the park. A monumous event! It was very well down and good times were had by all. Now Im back at work. sigh. Doing some oh so exciting database updating. At least its a break from leaving messages for people who never call me back.

Of course we didnt know that check out was at 2 so people are still on our site. So go off to Kemptville (yes its as small as it sounds) to waist some time. Some lame shopping and lunch later we head back. Duff sets up the tent and then we get down to the business of making a super awsome fire. I pretty much took on fire tending duties after that. It was too cold for swimming so we walked around the trails (after we put the fire out of course). We cooked dinner on the fire, had some excellent dark rum and just chilled. By the time it started raining too hard for our shelter to hold up it was late enough for bed. The tent was dry and we had a mattress so sleeping was not problem. When we woke up it was hot! We did more fire and went swimming and then home we went. Aside from the mosquitos and the bites all over my legs and toes it was excellent. It was about as rough as I am willing to go (running water) but I'll gladly go again. You may all be shocked now.
These mosquito bites are driving me up the wall!!!!"

Apparently it would just leave a big ugly scar (not sure how thats possible with a clean insision)and since its not infected they would rather leave it in. He even told them it hurt, a lie, and they still didnt want to. Meanwhile it doesnt bother him so we can just add this to the pieces of metal he has in his body (his ankle). Hes gonna be fun at the airport hehehe.

Last week i went to Hope volley ball and got burned. Sat Nadav and I went to Bluesfest. Very cool. Saw lots of random bands some good some not so good. I like 2 in particular. Danny Michel and Something Sexton (Michael I think). Also so Roseanne Cash who wasnt all that good. Anyway we spent the whole day outside and of course I got burned on all the places that werent burned before. I've decided I may want to look in to some sunscreen. My new favorite product is this solarcaine, ladicaine, whatever stuff (referred to as green goo) which makes all the burning pain go away.

Going to the Myers dealer today to meet the guy corey and dough referred me too. We'll see what happens. Work is retardedly slow today. NO ONE is here except me and Steve. Its so quiet its almost creepy. Garry and Bruce are on vacation, Robin is who knows where and Danielle is home with her sick kid. So alone....at least I have Cam to entertain me.

There is this huge GM sale going on and the car is selling pretty cheap. Now I have to decide wether I make the downpayment and hope I get some money back from selling the shit-mobile or if I try to sell first. I cant even advertise it until I get the breaks done on monday oy. Meanwhile the oil light went on yesterday. Ended up putting way too much in and had to get it drained. I went this morning to sunys (danielle recomended it) and they did it for free. I am definelty going back there for oil changes and whatever the warranty wont cover on my new car.

Robin was down yesterday and I she found an appartment. Finally. Its right on laurier about 5 min from the university. Guess where I will be crashing a lot. Wed the brat and I went shooting with with Graeme. Pistol. Havent doen that in a while, it was fun. Shot a 9mm which made my arms shoot up. I got the shell in the face and it hit me in the lip in 3 places.

So for those of you who werent aware, nadav is working contstruction. Its horrible, unsafe place. He is always getting injured and the tools they are given are old, rusted, and innapropriate for use. So 2 days ago hes using a hammer and a piece of it flies off and embedded itself into his left arm. Off to the hospital he goes and after 7 hours, and digging around in the hole in his arm then decide they cant find it. They give him an appointment for july 17 to meet the surgeon. The problem is the wound close us before then...sigh. Its prob not dangerous to leave it in bit he is not interested in having a piece of dirty hammer in his arm."

Hes also a pot head like everyone else in the roofing industry. We went shopping yesterday. He got some gift certificates for his ishgirlfriend and I wanted pyjamas but I didnt find any.

Robin is in town to look at appartments. Im gonna meet her after work. Shes only staying tonight. I have the house to myself this weekend...if I was 16 I would have a party. Anyway the brats in mtl and and rents are going to some cottage. Lauras going to TO tomorrow so corey and i will be left to our own devices.

So corey sat through the hebrew hammer last night. He loved it as i knew he would. He found it hillarious which it is. To any of you who havent seen it. Do so!

So Laura, corey, Nadav and I went to the trews concert at the tulip festival friday. It was great except it was outside in the pouring rain. 3 hours...so cold and wet. All of us huddled under mummys gold umbrella. They played well though. Then it was back to lauras for drying off and drinks

I kinda wish I had gone in after the class to at least check my email cuz there was so much work waiting for me!! Im still behind. Now way I will be caught up before monday...ggrrr. Met Mecha's sister 2 days ago. She looks and acts exactly like him!!"

"event","So we did the usual TO thing over the break. Included the New years at vickys. I noticed we do more eating of the food the day after for lunch and dinner instead of new year eve. I guess its just late to eat then. Whatever, the point is the food is excellent. Back at work now and busy as ever. But its good cuz you all know how i strive on boredom. Im in my new office which is lacking in windows and heat. I dont really mind the window thing but being cold all day sucks yo and i hate wearing a sweater all the time. At least when they put the general heat up my office warms up too. Mike gave me 60 bucks (cash) for chanukah for this blazer thing I wanted at the goth store. Of course they didnt have my size left when I got there so I bought 2 stp cd's and the cluless dvd for under 60 bucks. Yesterday brat and I went to this dress store on sparks which was owned by a sehr pushy indian man who kept telling us about how the stuff was from LA and blah blah. Today I went back at lunch and actually bought the dress I tried on. I needed something for Jamie's wedding in like 2 days. you know what else would help? A GIFT!! Im gonna have to go to a home something store tonight. So someone random person starts talking to me on msn yesteray. Turns out to be Paul Telner's brother! (none of you will know who that is but he went to borden with me and we were friends. Hes a comedian with his own show in the states now). Speaking of random....im sure we were. hehehe the ""we were""s lined up."

"event","So there are some good things about being a lonely Jew at Christmas. You get time off. You can actually rest during your time off cuz you dont have the holiday stress. You have way less people to shop for, therefore spending less money (says the Jew). And last but not least, you get lots of stuff from everyone else. Like I got some cookies, and bath stuff and chocolates at work. From Laura I got black silk pyjamas (does she know me or what) and I know Mike and Corey are working on my present. I got Laura a ""im not with stupid anymore tshirt, a cookie sheet and some shooters, corey got a cd of our songs, Mike got a flask with ""sunshine"" engraved on it, berube got a ""amature porn start"" tshirt and a beer mug from Laura and me and Mecha got an earing and bendy straw from Laura and me. 

So had my work xmas party on tuesday. Was at some golf club in aylmer totally in the middle of nowhere. I brought Mike, partly because he brought me to his, partly cuz I knew he was a good schmoozer and would be an appropreate date for someone on probation and partly cuz hes the guy Im dating now (not exclusively!) Anyway he played his part well...good choice by me.  From what kristine and Isa and Anne marie were telling me I expected everyone to be drunk and crazy....but no. Everyone was sober and tame. It was because we were in the middle of nowhere and no one could leave their car there to take a taxi home...even though the company would have paid for it. Meh, I was home by 11 which was just as good cuz we had to be at work the next day.

I now have a new office. The person replacing Natalie and doing the WNP is getting my office (probably cuz its closer to Dave) and Im taking Isabelles. I had to do all the moving stuff today and its still not done. I'm gonna have to finish it when im back and running around doing a million other things. oh well."

"event","Peterborough once again last weekend. Didnt see Donny at all cuz Laura was mad at him. He tried to see me alone but I figured my loyalties lie with Laura  and he was being a dick about it anyway. I dont respect the guy as a person anymore so no big loss. However there is some cute news. Lauras family took me to a christmas treet cutting down place (tree farm as I call it) and I sawed down a tree. And then i carried my cut tree all the way back to the car. I put together a fake tree and decorated it, managing to injure myself in the process (of course). Did a traditional post cutting down tree lunch with lauras extended family and then we headed back to Ottawa. Good times had by all. I have a feeling berube is starting to ignore us. I could however be jumping to conclusions as I tend to do. Oh, saw narnia in pborough too. Verry good. Highly recomended by moi."

"event","So I found a place that makes good kebab. The best since I left Vienna. In fact everything I've had here (known as shwarma) has been pretty awful. Im eating it now for lunch. I would love to actually have something to do during lunch time but Im  loser and a loner...oh well. Went to Peterborough on the weekend. Only  hung out with Donny and Martin. Donny's still hot but I my interest in him is gone. I just dont have any respect for the guy.....doesnt mean I didnt enjoy his hot company anyways. Meanwhile I've decided men are scum again. Keary brought her friend Eric out with us (Donny's ex's friend). He spent most of the time hitting on me. He was ugly and post (as in, dumb as a) so I didnt really care besides the attention, which is always nice. We meet up with Donny and go to crash at his place and leave Keary and Eric. Donny asks, were you two hooking up? No, says I. Well probably better cuz he has a gf, says Donny. What??? says I. Yeah, they've been together for like 2 years, says Donny. GGRRRR says I. Why are men evil?!?! Anyhoo I got about 2 hours of sleep sat night. Fun fun. Now Im at work and my shoulders are killing me, but not he usual pain. Wonder what I did."

"event","Meow! So work is busy. Really busy. I never get through even half of what I plan to do in a day...Im so gonna get fired hehehe. The people are really nice and patient with my millions of questions all the time. I feel bad but 4 days of training is nothing and if I dont know then i just dont know. I would rather annoy people then mess up. Speaking of messing up, I managed to put a virus on my comp yesterday. I opened an email that was not to be opened and boom. Why did I open this email? Because the subject was ""new email address"" or whatever and part of my job is update the member's info in the database. Anyway I called Keith to my rescue and he was not pleased. Lots of ""what did you open? what did you do? and DONT DO IT AGAIN!"" going on. He seems like an asshole but i think deep down hes not. I was warned about the wrath of keith and that it was only a matter of time before I did something to the comp and felt it...took me less than 2 weeks hehehe. 

So here I am drinking warm, flat, diet gingerale (yes its as apatizing as it sounds) and being exhausted. Thats what ive been for the past 3 weeks. Just wanna go home and sleep. I dont of course but thats what i would like to do. Its becoming evil winter and Im not impressed. nope nope. Plan to go to Peterborough again this weekend with Laura. I really dont understand why I do that but I do. Her mom sent me a bday card! I love her mom. Im gonna go get her a present at lunch time tomorrow cuz i love her."

Drove down friday with laura and denis. Saw jamie, steph, kemba, ilana and robin. Went to tokyo sat night. Laura and i picked out a sweater and jeans for denis to buy and he looked hot. Came back Sunday afternoon and got ready for my first day of my new job as membership coordinator for the CWTA (canadian wireless telecommunications association). My duties are as follows: update the website, convince people to join the association and be the director of communications bitch. Im an admin assistant again but at least this time I can say ""no, im too busy"" and I HAVE AN OFFICE! That means i can close my door!! The pay is better too. I only get this week for training so i hope i can pull it off. Im terrified of what happens after the woman leaves. Hopefully i dont get fired cuz after my 3 months probation i get full benefits."

I went to wone yesterday at an agency and the woman was so incredibly rude and condiscending I almost lost it. Its like a) your not much older than me b) who the hell do you think you are. Anyway I'll give it another chance and if she keeps it up I'll speak to her manager. Anyway I do like it here.

So sunday laura and I had our thanksgiving party. Consisted of 8 male guests (typical of me and laura). Marting and Donny, peterborough guys, came down for it. We made turkey, mashed potatoes, potatoe, squash, veggies, rolls and bought pumpkin and blueberry pie. Everyone loved it. Complete with endless praise from the guys about our cooking and thanks for inviting them. We also invited Denis from work. Did I mention Donny was the sexiest creature on the face of the planet (yes he is brat). After dinner we all went out clubbing. I was getting an excellent amount of attention from Donny and Mecha....really cant go wrong with that. The whole night was awsome...Im extrememly impressed with us."

So yesterday was Laura's last day and CNC Ajura. We all went out for lunch and it was sad. Then Denis randomly goes to us ""so what are we doing tonight?"" Buh??? Denis never hangs out with us (except when we are picking him up or drvining him home). So we decide to go out with him and his friends. We went to the drink where i had never been before. Denis is crazy. He was dancing on the speakers and all over the place and wow. I would have never guessed from how he acts at work. NEVER! But it was great and his friends are very cool too. Water cooler stories...hehehe."

"event","Yes, I went back. I would be lying if I said that Donny (no amont of words can describe his hot and sexyness)wasn't one of the reasons but not the only one. Laura and I were actually supposed to go to TO for Martin's bday but turned out he already did something there and wanted to go home (peterborough) that weekend so we met him there. Laura always likes to go home and since I was planning on going away that weekend anyway I decided to go too. We left friday afternoon with every intention of making it a chill night and saving the big partying for Sat with Martin. Didn't quite happen that way. We ended up getting good and drunk and hopping around to different clubs and bars. Started at the Vibe where Donny is a bouncer (did I mention HOT!!) and then he ditched us for Laura's ex...hardocre drama there, while we hung out with paul and kerry and various other friends of lauras. Some guy proposed to me at the bar. So after a kick ass night we get back to lauras late and pass out. Next day I start to get cramps. I assumed it was the usual PMS thing and tried to ignore it. As the day progressed the pains got worse and moved into my stomach. I watched nip tuck with Martin while laura did some stuff and he is totally awsome. We decided to be each others marriage back ups if we werent married by 35. That leaves us both 11 years hehehehe. Oh, hes hot too. Anyway we go out and meet up his gf and donny and i get progressively worse. Laura is tired too so we end up going home at like 11. We were supposed to visit donny at work and party there but it was not to be. I tried to sleep. that too was not meant to be. I threw up 4 times and tossed and turned in excrutiating pain all night. Finally in the morning when everyone woke I forced down some tea and laura and i hit the road. I took a gravol in the car and passed out. My stomach was better but i was so weak. Stayed up long enough to say bye to the rents and went back to bed. I couldnt go to work today cuz i still feel awful. The pain is less but im so weak and its jsut enough pain to keep me from being normal. I better be fine soon

So this is the latest at work. Ive been changed to receptionist for 3 months (may or may not be extended) while laura is taking my place as ""day to day basis"" instead of being just let go. I was supposed to start training today but obviously my stomach had other plans. I like working there but this is getting a bit ridiculous."

"event","Yes last night laura and I went to the concert. We had seats in the 300 level but then got upgraded to the 100 which is amazing. My old high school history teacher was a security guard there but I got his name wrong when I spoke to him...hehehe Im a loser. Anyway the concert was incredible. It was up there with smashing pumpkins. They sounded just like on the cds and amazing performers and energy. They really brought the crowd together. I got a super music high (by far the best kind). They played for about 3 hours straight. 2 hour show and 1 hour encore. When we got out it was pouring and we were soaked by the time we got to the car. We both went home and passed out.

So what made the concert better was that it was a spectacular ending to the shittiest 2 days ever. Thursday Dom (our boss) told us that one of us was getting laid off and the other could be a MOB (csr position we are hiring for). Basically it was our decision who goes and if we couldnt decide they have someone in mind. WTF! Ok so we spent the night agonizing....Friday we told him that neither of us wants to be a MOB so they are gonna have boot one of us themselves. Well it turned out to be Laura cuz she doesn't speak french. I get to be on a ""day to day basis"", one day on payroll, one day recruiting blah blah. So needless to say im looking for a new job. It really sucks cuz we really liked it there. Then we found out that we stay til next friday and they wanted to lose one of us tuesday just for the MOB start day but since thats not happening we stay til friday. Whatever, life is life na na na na na na"

"event","Ok so as most of you know by now I have a job. Im a recruiting administrator which means I screen people over the phone and invite them in for interviews for a recruiting agency. CNC Global Anjura. Laura actually hooked me up with this job. I was in for an interview for the position im screening for now and they decided to hire me there because they were getting rid of the person they had. Which is good but also means I have the added pressure of being better than the person they fired. I like the people there a lot they are super nice and fun. Working right next to laura is also awsome...we carpool and have lunch together. The place is exhausting though, no one stops for a second.

Went to the trews concert thursday with corey mark and laura. THey were really good. Corey knows them so he and I hung out backstage with them for a while. Hehehe Im all about the bands. I got free tickets from some guy for a concert tonight but its in barhaven so thats way too far. Im now just waiting for lauara so we can go for coffee and then to mechas party. Im really not looking forward to spending time with a bunch of stoned 19 year olds but whatever, maybe it will be ok. Corey and mark will either show up later or we'll go somewhere to meet them.

As far as how I ""feel"" good but not content. Marco's prfencing of his undying love for me really didnt help. I burst into tears and kicked him out of the house. What he was thinking exactly would happen who knows. Im not sure why he thought that after I told him I didnt want to be his girlfriend was a good time to throw that at me. We haven't spokend since (that was tuesday night). Im glad he ""got that off his chest"" but so not a smart thing to do.....oy."

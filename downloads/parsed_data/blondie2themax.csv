"event","so today my family was the top story on the news. See, my grandpa lives with us and my mom called the La Porte ambulance to escort him to Bayshore hospital.  They said they were full so they gave my mom a list of other EMS people to call. SO she called one and she said it wasn't an emergancy.  Anyway, so the place she called ended up not having a permit to come over to help laporte residents...so they got pulled over by a cop and one of the EMS guys that was coming to help my grandpa ended up being arressted for cussing at the cop..so yea, the bottom line is we didn't get help for my pe paw right away! So this morning I wake up to camera's and channel 11 news outside of my house!! YAY!! They interviewed my mom and it was tonight's top story on channel 11 news.  It is also shown in some newspapers as well..oh, and my truck was on the news!! YAY!! crazyness!"

I finished my course a long time ago, but in order for me to have an off period, my mom has to sign some paper in the office.  She went to the office this morning, so hopefully everything worked out!! Anyway, There's this website on Fight Club that I absolutly love.  Fight Club is my fave movie EVER!! Marla is my heroe.  They have soundtrack music you can listen to, movie trailers, funny stuff they play before the movie like Tyler Durden saying ""There are fire exits in the theatre, so in case of a fire, calmly move to the fire exits...(this is where the screen starts to fade yet tyler starts talking again the light comes back and he says...) Did you know you can drink urine? Oh yeah, its sterile."" and thats it.  I love the whole concept of the movie, their wording, and just EVERYTHING about it. sigh.  I wish I could star in it or something.  Go here to visit the site:

"event","Yesterday I was having a kinda sorta bad day...Kevin took me out on the cutest/sweetest date EVER...GLOW IN THE DARK GOLF @PUTTING EDGE! HE IS SO AWESOME<3! We always have so much fun when we're out together whether we're by ourselves or with other people too. After 18 holes of putting edge and me screwing up and laughing at Kevin kicking my ball into the hole...we went shopping! We went into Hot Topic and looked at a bunch of goofy glasses, alas I found some really cute black ones <3! I also found these black pants with a little gun on them with stars coming out rather than bullets..think what you want, but I thought they were adorable :D. Kevin says he wants to take me shopping for my birthday because I am in fact the ultimate shopper. HA. So last night I get home and my mom and dad ask me about glow in the dark golf, so I tell them every little detail because it was fun fun fun! YAY! Yesterday was really fun, but today I went to summer school and my HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY mood soon fled. My teacher was bitchy all day today. It made me scared to ask for help...but I did...and she made me even more confused..she yelled a lot too...I wanted to curl up in a ball and pee on myself...Which I most certainly did...not do. Anyway, Plato sucks! Alg2 B does too! I made a 90 on a test today<3! Anyway, Im scared that Im going to fail because I have 2 days left to get to 60% (which=passing!) So that REALLY made me upset. Then on my way to the hair place my mom told me she didnt want me to cut my hurr due to senior pics. So I was like ok cool I wont. We get to the hair place, I tell my pal Chris what I wanted to do...Platinum blonde, dark blonde, and a lighter blonde on top and leave my brown alone on the bottom. I took out the red from my hair though. So the guy who shampoos my hair starts talking to me about music and guess who we talk about forever, you guessed it, The Cure lol. He was a cool guy, he had blue and black hair. Anyway, so Chris blow dryes my hair and what not and I get MAD but I told him I liked it...My hair doesnt really look different at all. My mom is taking me back to get more platinum put in YAYAYAYAY we agreed on something SHWING! She said I could cut my hair next time too! YAY! Ok, I'm sorry if your eyes fell out from there sockets due to the fact that this entrie is longer than...mmm...OKBYE!"

I tried to introduce her to my kind of music(the cure, smashing pumpkins, the moody blues, radiohead and stuff)...but she prefers her music lol..ahwell. She likes the used and my chemical romance..so thats cool I guess. :]..oh, then we went and helped her dad work @ 230 in the am...then we came home around 4ish. I fell right to sleep as soon as my head hit the pillow! ahhh do I love sleep. No matter how many problems I have, sleep just takes it alllll away...and I love that.  Then I woke up around 2 in the afternoon, helped Danielle clean up the mess we made, got my stuff together, and headed back home.  My mom and sister were gone to the mall...wasnt that nice of them to invite me? Well, right now im having a hard time with some things, but it will all get better. Kay2thecore asked me on a date to the mall today, but it would have been very rude of me to leave danielle's to go to the mall, so I told kayla another time. Tomorrow(maybe), Kim and I are supposed to go on a hunt for clothing @ thrift stores n schtuff. Kim and I still talk all the time, but we havent had time to hang out ::sniff sniff:::[ last night @ like 11 Danielle, my brother Bryan(Blackwell) and I all went to wal mart! We saw my other bff ashley and her pal amber there with their friend jeremy, and then we saw Gabeatron aka Gabe m, davester, greg, javad, john, and blake there too! yay! Then we saw these guys in batman masks running all about walmart I was like woo thats cool! not really but ok..anyways. Kevin comes home from  his cruise tomorrow! yayayayay! I sure have missed him a lot. He called me and told me that there was this place in Key West called MALLARYS SQUARE(Mallary being spelt the improper way-->MALLORYS SQUARE)he took a pic of it for me :]! I love kevin..:]...but yes I feel like I have no friends anymore.  Its like the people that I talk to are only on the internet..which isnt a bad thing..I know I have friends but its like I dont really hang out with many people. Ah well...no one calls anymore...I shouldnt have to be the one to always call my friends to listen to what they're doing..im never invited anywhere anymore really. It made me so happy when Kay invited me somewhere today :*]! Well this is longer than a horse's...face."

I've gotten really into Jesus again..which is a good thing..there was this long period where I didn't quite care about so much and I was down in the pits, but I started praying a lot again and I've noticed that things have slowly been getting better. I decided I am going to try out for cheerleading again. All though I'm not doing so hot in a few classes...I only have 9 days left to get my grades where they need to be before the doomed report cards come out. Today at cheer practice Edgar (our coach from Hell who is usually mean) told me I was so funny that I'd make it to MadTV or SNL one day! I freaked out I was like that has been my dream ever since I've been a kid! (SNL not MadTV) lol It made my day!!!!!!!Anyway, I suppose that is all for now...Goodbye!! :-D Love, Mallary"

Chad and I made poo poo out of sand...don't ask...no really dont. Um we went to Goodwill and some surf shops for Tylers sake. Chad and I made a bet that I would/wouldnt go out in the water...I DID so I won..Of course. Then Chad pushed me in a shopping cart hahaha it was fun! After that we just walked around for a while and took pics and what not. Around 5ish we left because Danielle had to be home around 6 o clock. I had a lot of fun but I did get a wee bit of a sunburn :( I dont like Senses Fail (sorry to anyone who does..) Not my cup of tea.. And yeah thats practically ALL we listened to on the way there and on the way back..I was going insane..but Tyler was nice enough to drive all of us down there so I had to deal with his music one way or the other...Then we dropped Dan and ""Ass stain"" Astin off at her casa. The rest of us ate @ Gringos..I went home later on...showered...got on here as usual...then went off to bed! I loved going to the beach though. Its really quiet and nice like. Im ready for the summer..School can kiss my ass to the max! Today was fun! People complimented my hurr so I suppose that gave a little sprakle of fun to today. Then my mom checked me out of espanol due to a dentist appt.

I just want to see her again. She was such a good friend. Whenever it started snowing today, I got so excited but upset at the same time.  I know that she had something to do with the snow today...i went outside and ran around in it hahaha i=loser dork to the max!

""Life is full of chapters. The challenge is to appreciate each chapter for itself, and to refrain from judging any one chapter until we approach the end of the larger work that is our life. Only then can we really understand how each chapter contributes to the unfolding of the entire story. Only then will we have the proper perspective. There is need for tolerance, acceptance, patience, humility, humor, and, I think, an abiding faith that things are going to work out in the long run.""

So yeah yesterday I wrote an entry and it got erased which totally sucked. It wasnt anything important but I was EXTREMELY bored so I decided to write. Yesterday my mom told me that she found a bag with goat heads and chicken cadavers inside while she was cleaning the backyard. Can't you guys believe that? Totally freaky!! I think it was from my neighbors that do santeria. If I would have found it I know I would have freaked out. But yeah, I work this entire weekend and I feel like going out which really suxxxx. Ooooo, Im planning to get the drop for my car this Saturday. Hopefully my brother doesnt forget to order it even though I think he is more excited than me. Like him and his friends have plans for my car and I kind of him reminded him of something: IT'S MY CAR!!! But yeah Im also planning to get black rims to match its color. SO PIMP!!! The rims Im getting in March as probably a gift to myself for passing my 2nd calculus test :crosses finger:. But yeah I really feel like going out!!! Anywhere but preferably something fun. My friend was inviting me to go ice skating but Im not down with that. I want to go out somewhere were I can meet people!!! Club anyone????  I need to go work on my calculus and stats today cause I meet up with my tutor and I dont want to be completely lost tomorrow. Calculus was so confusing today. I was like WTF??? But apparently a lot of the other people in my class are lost too cause this guy in my class was like ""Did u understand anything of what he just explained?"" which of course I didnt and we both laughed. But yeah chain rule, slain rule, who gives a f#&k???? Any-who, I shall update later!!!"

"event","Ok so I just got back from work about 30 minutes ago. Work today wasn't bad. No angry or bitchy customers. One of of our regulars came in today and told us that there had been an accident near the McDonald's near my job. A 22 year old riding a motorcyle crashed into an SUV in front of him. Its weird cause I didnt even know this person but I feel extremely sad. He was so young. I passed by the street where it happened cause I have to drive by there to go home. I was planning to take the long way but I didn't think there were still gonna be cleaning up. There was still spots of what I'm guessing was blood in the streets. I felt like my heart stopped for a couple of seconds. I can just imagine how the family must feel. But yeah, change of subject. So I went to the mall to find the shoes that I had seen at Journey's yesterday. When I went to the mall yesterday my size had been there but I was with my brother's friend gf who was looking for flip flops so I told her that after she got hers we would come back for mines. When we came back, the lady right in front of me took them right in front of my own eyes. It was horrible!!! I mean I kept watching her cause she didnt seem too sure, and I thought she was going to put them back but she went ahead and payed for them. I stood there watching everything cause I couldn't believe it. I mean what were the chances that in those 10 min. that I was gone somebody was going to take the exact shoes that I wanted in my size? Close to zero!!! But yeah, I went to the mall today but of course they didnt have my size so I asked the guy who was working there if I could special order them and he said that he was going to check. So he gets my hopes up and tells me that it seems like he can. He asked me for my phone #, address, yada yada yada. I was so happy cause I though I was going to get my super cute shoes and then he tells me he cant order them cause they are all out. GOSH I was so upset after that. I also found this shirt with an owl on it which was super cute but I didnt buy it cause it just didnt look right. I mean it was just a t-shirt but it has to fit a certain way you know. So I didnt find anything at the mall I wanted except for my new bag for school which I had to get in another color cause the other color was sold out. Guess it wasnt my day for shopping. Tomorrow (or today, however u want to look at it), I am going to Best Buy to see what dvds I can buy. Im definetely buying Troy cause I really liked that movie. Greek history is so interesting. Brad Pitt looked extremely good in that movie even though I wasnt rooting for him. Well, I shall update later!!! This entry turned out to be longer than planned....."

"event","Well, well, I hope everyone had a good Christmas this year!!! I hadn't been able to update because I've been working like EVERYDAY!!! I had to work Christmas Eve, thankfully during the morning, and I had to work Christmas Day which totally annoyed the hell out of me. I finished my shopping around Wednesday. Gosh I spent a lot of money this year but I think it was worth it. So anyways, on Friday my store got robbed and I was actually there through the whole thing. It was a little bit before 1 p.m. and it was these four old guys. YES, OLD GUYS!!! Everyone always blames young people for everything and it is so far from the truth. But yeah, it wasn't at gun point or anything they just ran out with a bunch of DVDs. They even laughed at my manager's face when she went outside to I guess try to do something. While the whole thing happened I was completely speechless, which is so funny cause people always wonder what they would do in situations like that and when the moment comes you are just shocked that is happening. So we were able to get the license plate number but that wasn't useful at all because of course the license plate was stolen!! Gosh I was so pissed off!!! And hear this: we called 911 like 10 times and they wouldn't pick up!! We called the police and their fun was busy!! I mean HELLO how about if it had been something worse? I think they finally did call back like 15 minutes later but the policeman didnt show up until like 2 hours later. So yesterday, like I said before I had to work and I was completely annoyed because my family was going to my grandma's house and I wanted to go. Usually I wouldn't care about working on Christmas day since we usually celebrate the night before but since my family was going to my grandma's house I was completely annoyed the whole time I was at work. There were some highlights during the night though: first of all the MOD told me that the guys from the robbery had gotten caught at another store which was absolutely hilarious. The policeman that had made the report the day before had told him that they were gonna bring by the guys so that we could identify them but that never happened. I asked the MOD if he thought the police would be ok with us laughing at the thieves faces since they had been laughing at us the day before. Ok so the 2nd highlight of the night was that I saw this kid I use to have a crush on, and I guess I still kind of so since I got so nervous when I saw him. Like my heart actually jumped when he called my name and I turned around and saw him. Gosh he is so cute!!! But yeah I said hi back and that was gonna be that but he actually gave me a kiss on the cheek which totally caught me off guard so it made me more nervous and the only thing that I was able to say to him was ""Wow I haven't seen you in a long time!"", which is not really true cause I did see him in school but I didn't say hi cause I got way to giggly. Gosh!!! This always happens to me!!! I mean honestly I need to stop being so freaking SHY!!!! I didn't even wish him a merry christmas. Im such a loser when it comes to these stuff. So yeah I wasn't on register but the MOD told me to get on register for a little while and he was still on the line and he was next and I was suppose to take care of him but the MOD came back. Only time I wish I had been on register the whole night. But yeah he left and he said bye and I said bye back and one of the guys that was working with me started bothering me about that and I was all like ""no he use to work here"" thing when in reality I wish it was all like that. But yeah he is absolutely adorable and he is so nice you guys!!! But enough about that. The third highlight of the night was when we closed early since it was a H-O-L-I-D-A-Y. But some customers refuse to understand that and we had to tell a bunch of people that we were already closed while they begged to let them pick something really quick. Well too bad!!! They should have been there earlier!!! It's like people don't think we have families too that we want to go home to. How inconsiderate. But yeah that was my night with of course the nicest thing was seeing him. Of course I do still think all guys are jerks but that would be another entry. I shall update later!!!!"

When I got out of there I felt like screaming at the top of my lungs but of course that might have looked weird to some people so I ended up walking around with a smirk on my face until I got in my car and finally let out a semi-scream. I did really good in my French final considering the fact I barely looked through my notes. I have no idea how I did in my other finals but I hope I did good. Im just glad is over. I have nothing to worry about for 3 weeks!!! That feels so good!!! So Sat. I had an extremely long day!!! I woke up at 9:30 to finish studying for my test. I took my test from 2-3:50 and then at 6 I went in to work. It was extremely busy and I had to be on register the whole night except for the last hour and a half since the manager told me to start fixing up the store. Gosh people are so messy. I though it wasn't going to be that bad since one of my co-workers that had left earlier said she had fixed it up but NOOOO!!! Customers are so inconsiderate. Honestly. It took me a while to fix up the store and then I had to run a bunch of stuff out. We didnt get out of there till 2:20 AM. My whole body was aching. I was suppose to go watch Ocean's Eleven with KK but I cancelled. IM SORRY KK!!!! I know you were mad girl but honestly I felt so tired and I wasnt gonna call you at 2 AM to tell you that I wasnt up for it since you told me you were probably gonna be sleeping. So anyways, my plans for today are to relax. I want to go to the gym, bake some brownies, and watch movies. Can't Wait!!! I haven't been able to relax in a while and today is my only day off off. I work every single day after today except that Im on call on Friday. If they call me I am gonna be realle pissed off but whatever. Ok I shall update later!!! This entry was a little too long...."

I wasn't really worried about any of my finals until I started to think about them in my last class. We have covered so many subjects and it feels as if I'm not gonna have time to review all of them. I work this entire weekend except for Sunday and I haven't seen next week's schedule. I need to learn how to manage my time better!!! And there is so many movies I still haven't seen which I have to turn in tomorrow so that is also holding me back from studying. Yes, putting off school to watch movies...I do this all the time!! NOT GOOD!! So, enough about that. Today in my LEI class my professor was kind of summarizing what he wanted us to take from his class and something he said really makes sense. He told us that life is fool of risks and chances. We shouldn't be afraid to take a chances in life because if you think about out everything you do is a risk. Whether is deciding to watch from the sidelines of the game instead of actually playing the game and being part of it. Some risks just seem to be riskier than others in our minds and we are afraid that if we take the bigger risk we will fail. He told us that its really important for us not to be afraid of failing every once in a while and taking a chance. I really want to apply this to life cause I feel like I always take the ""safe"" option. Man, I'm really gonna miss that class. It really made me think of a lot of things...Well, that's enough for today!!! Ta-Ta!! Until later!!"

The march itself was exciting but also a little disappointing, with not nearly as many people as at previous marches I've been to. There didn't seem to have been much publicity, and there was a big march in Washington the previous day. What was gratifying however was to see all ages represented, from little kids to college students to middle-agers like myself to senior citizens. After the march itself ended various groups had information tables set up, and one of the most powerful parts for me was when some people from Iraq Veterans for Peace were solemnly reciting a seemingly endless list of names of American soldiers killed in this war--and if they'd included the names of all the wounded as well, and all the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis wounded or killed, the recitation would still be going on now. <br/><br/>This administration seems intent to keep the blinders on and to continue stumbling along in the same manner with this war, but if enough people keep protesting and voting and donating time and energy and money to stop it, maybe someday we can actually make a difference.<br clear=""all""/>"

So yesterday I went to the Humane Society and came back home with this new cat. The name they gave her there was Josie but I don't like that too much and since cats doen't really respond to a name anyhow, I'm thinking of changing her name. Last night I came up with Kerry......I'd just finished reading a wonderful novel about Ireland (At Swim, Two Boys by Jamie O'Neill) and have been thinking Irish thoughts. And three years ago right about now Durly and I were in County Kerry, so Kerry Cat sounds about right. I'll try that out for awhile and see how it goes.<br /><br />Whatever her name, she seems like a very sweet cat. The info from the Humane Society said when bringing a new cat home to confine it to a small area for the first few days. Well, I closed off a few rooms for the first few hours yesterday, but she was enjoying exploring all through the house and didn't seem to be having any new house anxiety, so now it's all hers. This afternoon she discovered the same shelf in the bedroom where Bigley liked to nap, and she's been crashed there for the last few hours.<br /><br />I *never ever* was a cat person before Bigley adopted me and he's the only cat that I'd ever spent much time with, so it's interesting now to see the differences. This new one (Kerry.....?) is much more solid, and she's also quite playful, and instead of meowing, she sort of squeaks. Apparently she's only been an indoor cat before, so the mailman can probably breathe easier. I'm looking forward to her companionship. But, me with another cat.....who woulda thunk it??<br clear=""all"" />"

"event","A yoga studio that some of my friends attend was having some free intro classes yesterday so I decided to try it out. Since my back injury a few months ago I've still been feeling kind of stiff at times, and thought this might help loosen things up. It was a pretty basic introduction and we only did simple moves, but it went for almost 2 hours and I'll tell you, it was tough at times, and I'm feeling sore today! I'm not ready to commit to a whole series of classes yet, but I may start attending one session a week for awhile just to see how it goes. Things have been very stressful at work lately too, so hopefully yoga would help me deal with some of that as well. But I'm definitely not ready to buy any of those new age-y yoga outfits just yet--hopefully shorts and a t-shirt will be fine. Ommmmmmmm"

"event","Happy Holidays everyone! I was down in CT visiting my parents for a few days. I'd planned to drive down there last weekend to celebrate Chanukah with them, but my car was in the shop getting its fuel and brake lines replaced, so the trip had to be postponed.

My Mom had a list of chores waiting for me, mostly little minor repairs of various things around their house, and I kept pretty busy for the whole two days I was there. I was feeling pretty depressed on Sat, thinking about their declining health as well as how many things in their house seem to be falling into disrepair. Nothing major, just wear and tear from the 50 years since they built the house. Time is catching up with everything and everyone, I guess.

On Sat afternoon I made a trip to the recycling center with lots of newspapers, bottles, and cans that had been piling up for awhile in their cellar. Drove back to their house along some back roads that I haven't been on in years. I'm glad not to live in my hometown anymore, but it's somehow comforting and nostalgic to drive on those roads again -- names of family friends and people I went to school with coming back to me as I passed their old houses: Bachiochi, Satkowski, Mordasky, Skopek, Ducharme, Campo, Baldracci, Fontanella, Goltz, Warrington, Trempko, Palacko, Pokorny, Dadalt, Hastings.......Many of those people have moved away or died, and one of these days my family will only be a memory in that town as well.

It wasn't all depressing however--I enjoyed cooking and baking for my folks and joking around with them, and playing with their crazy dog Sadie. But it was nice to get home last night to spend a relaxing evening here drinking tea and reading some short stories while sitting by the fire. No White Christmas or Chanukah here this year--it's been up in the 40's, 50's and 60's during the last few weeks, and we've only had a dusting of snow that was gone by the following day. I can hear a steady rain falling outside right now--sure wish it were snow instead! This afternoon I had a nice phone call from Durlx--always good to hear from him. Unfortunately I had to cut our conversation short when some friends from out of town showed up unexpectedly at my front door--they were passing through town on their way home after visiting relatives who live near here. I've enjoyed having a nice long weekend--not looking forward to going back to work tomorrow. But there is another 3 day weekend for New Year's, yeeha! Happy Happy to you all.........."

"event","I called the vet a little while ago and I'm schedule to bring Bigley there in about an hour to have him put to sleep. He's had ups and downs over the past week or so, but he's hardly eating anything these days and he's lost a lot of weight and more importantly, he's lost that spark that he used to have. I've let him out of his bathroom confinement a bit more these last few days and he slept on my bed last night and then as I was waking up he came over and lay on my chest--a little morning routine that we'd developed but hadn't done in awhile. I talked to him (even though he's deaf) and asked his permission......I'm sure he understands on some level.

Tonight I'm leaving to spend Thanksgiving with my parents, and a friend was going to come here to feed him while I'm gone. But I would have had to keep him confined to the bathroom again and he hates being shut up in there. And I hate the thought of him being miserable for two days, especially when it was only going to be postponing the inevitable till next week anyway. I'm going to be a wreck at work today--already cried when I called to say I'd be in late, and probably I'll start bawling every time someone askes about him today. Man oh man, it's never easy, is it? 

I'll be back here Fri night or Sat. It's going to be sort of a bittersweet Thanksgiving, but life goes on."

The friend who looked after him while I was away on vacation told me that she was alarmed at how much water he was drinking, and that's continued since I've been back home. And, related to that, he's been peeing a lot--often not in the litterbox. A few days ago after he peed all over my firewood and fireplace gloves and carpet I finally brought him in to the vet. After various blood tests they determined that he has rather advanced diabetes and a related urinary tract infection (which is causing all the peeing in inappropriate places.)<br /><br />  Treatment for the diabetes would mean giving him insulin shots  morning and night every day for the rest of his life. I don't think that I could deal with the needles, and since I go away fairly often, it would be tough to ask someone else to do that twice a day whenever I'm away. And, not to sound heartless, but there's also the cost to consider--the insulin itself adds up quickly, but there are also regular visits to the vet to test and regulate the medication. The other option is to treat this current infection with antibiotics and then just let nature take its course, and I think that's what I'm choosing to do. The vet said that he could do more or less OK like this for awhile still, though I realize that we're just buying time right now.<br /><br />  So since Friday I've kept him closed up in the bathroom, with his food, water, and litter box in there. At first it seemed like prison, but now I'm thinking of it more like a hospital room. He's hardly eating or drinking anything, and mostly just sleeps for hours and hours. Hopefully  when the infection is cleared up I can let him have the run of the house again, but for now I can't risk having him pee all over things again. And it's sad thinking that this is the beginning of the end for him. Before I got him (or he got me) 5 1/2 years ago I never was at all a cat person, but he's really grown on me and has turned into a wonderful companion. I know that it's going to be hard when the time comes to make that decision, and I'll just have to take things day by day until then. <br /><br />  Time to go sit with him for a little while.<br clear=""all"" />"

"event","So the post-election euphoria is still here this morning, and damn, does it feel good! Yesterday at work everyone was all smiles, staff and customers alike. I was on the phone when the news about Rumsfeld came, and I heard all these whoops and hollers coming from the front of the store. Good riddance Rumsfeld, sorry it took this long. I turned on the radio for a little while to hear Bush's news conference and it was great to hear him squirming. I probably shouldn't be gloating so much, but it's been a long time coming. Here in Massachusetts, the bluest of blue states, we actually elected a Democratic governor for the first time in years. Deval Patrick is a true progressive and hopefully will be able to make some real positive changes for this state. And for the first time in I don't know how many years (maybe the first time ever) every single candidate that I voted for won. Woohoo! Sure, some people are going to say that before long it'll be back to politics as usual, but with the Democrats controlling Congress, at least now maybe we'll have some accountability. And it's not going to be perfect, but it sure is a step in the right (left?) direction. Now it's up to all of us to not let these new leaders fuck up. We've got to keep after them and not become complacent. But for now, let the giddiness continue!"

"event","I got home late on Friday--it was a fun trip, but it's good to be home again. Somehow I managed to throw my back out--noticed it the last morning I was at Assateague. Drove 4 1/2 hours later that day to get to my sister & brother-in-law's and sitting in the car seems to make it worse. It's been mostly just sort of a bother since then , but then yesterday all of a sudden I started getting muscle spasms and could hardly walk or move without pains shooting through my back and hip. Didn't sleep much last night because I couldn't find a comfortable position in bed. This morning I'm doing the heat/ice routine again along with taking some tylenol and it seems a little better. Guess tomorrow I'll call the chiropractor. I've had various back problems over the years, but it's been a long time since I've had anything this painful. Maybe my days of making long drives are over.

Aside from all that, it was a good trip. Assateague is beautiful at this time of year and not very crowded. I shared my campsite with wild ponies, deer, rabbits, a resident crab under the picnic table, and lots of birds and butterflies. Spent part of each day wandering aimlessly along the beach, watching the waves and dunes and sky. Also hung out at the campsite a lot, caught up on lots of reading. After a rainy spell one afternoon I emerged from the tent to see a rainbow stretching from the bay side of the island across into the ocean. Lay on top of the picnic table that Sat night and watched meteors streaking across the clear night sky.

It was nice to spend some time with my sister and brother-in-law too. They moved to VA about 2 years ago and this was the first time I'd been to their house and seen their menagerie. They have 4 horses, 4 dogs, and one cat. I had to admire Anita's dedication to her animals--each day before and after work, she spends hours with the horses--lots of work! Three of the 4 dogs are rotweillers, but apparently they haven't heard about the breed's reputation for being mean and scary--all of them are big babies, and very friendly. I left there on Thurs morning and drove all day-- back north over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, up through Maryland and Delaware, and ending up in NJ where I spent the night with a friend. Then drove back here on Friday, missing an exit after the Tappan Zee Bridge and taking an unplanned route through the SW corner of CT before making it to the road that would take me back home to this corner of Massachusetts.

Later this week it's......vacation time! On Thurs I'm driving down to Assateague Island off the Maryland coast. I'll be camping there at the National Park camping area just over the dunes from the ocean, falling asleep each night to the sound of the waves. It's been years since I was there last, and both previous stays were around this same time of year-- looking forward to being back again. It's one of the barrier islands, and the beach literally goes on for miles and miles. The weather report says that it should be in the 60's or so--and hopefully warmer than here at night! I'll bring plenty of warm clothes just in case. Probably I'll stay there for 3 or 4 days, then I'll head down to visit my sister and brother-in-law near Norfolk,VA for a few days. It's going to be a lot of driving, but it'll be nice to get away.

"event","Lousy wet miserable weather today. It was nice to sleep late this morning, and I spent most of the day inside doing cleaning and other fun stuff. The rain stopped for an hour or so this afternoon and I took advantage of that time to go outside and clean the stovepipe for my woodstove. The pipe comes out of the house about 6 feet off the ground, so I have to balance on a stepladder to remove the cleanout cap. I shined a flashlight up into the pipe and things didn't look too bad, so I tried to lean out of the way while sticking my arm up into it with a brush. A fair amount of ash and soot fell out, but I couldn't reach very far with the brush. While trying to think of what I might have that would reach further up into the pipe, I remembered that there was a flexible metal thing down in the cellar, maybe used to clean out pipes? It's about 15 feet long and has a piece on the end that looks sort of like a citrus reamer. Turns out to be the perfect tool to reach way up almost to the top of the stovepipe, and I sort of rattled it around from side to side and for my efforts got quite an impressive amount of soot and ash falling out. Maybe I should get a job as a chimney sweep--I certainly looked the part, arms and face all covered with soot. It was all pretty dry stuff, not the sticky kind of creosote that causes chimney fires. After washing up a bit I came back inside and took apart the woodstove and gave it a good cleaning. So now whenever it gets cold enough that I finally can't hold out any longer, the woodstove will be all ready to go, yeeha!"

"event","Last weekend was Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year. Yesterday my sisters and I received this email from our Mom:
------------------------------------------------------------------

 L'Shanah Tova to y'all...The new year here started with a bang! 
     Last night, a little after 9, I was reading in the living room, and Dad had gone to his room to start getting ready for bed, when I heard a terrible crash--never good news. 
     I ran in, and found him  in the wheelchair, which thankfully was upright, but he had overturned the desk that the computer is on. Big mess, with the computer, printer., papers, desk drawers and their contents, all over the floor; the front edge of the desk resting and tilted against the computer and the shredder. 
       Apparently, Dad had decided to open a window behind the desk, and instead of calling me, stood up and braced himself-- not against the desk, which is stable, but on the half-open drawer we jerry-rigged to hold the computer keyboard, so everything toppled. 
      There was no way I could right that fairly substantial piece of furniture, or lift the computer,so over his objections (he kept saying he'd take care of it!) I called Mike H. and asked him to get Dave K. too. It took the two of them to get the desk upright, then Dave worked to  get all the computer cords and plugs back where they belonged, and they stayed while I made sure the computer could work. (Dave was in his pajamas--he said he'd been practicing his guitar.)  
       Things never get dull here. 
        I woke about 6 a..m. in a puddle of perspiration.  The thermostat was set at 60 last night, but something must be off either with the thermostat or the furnace, because the thermometer at that point was 81, indoors,so I toddled down to the basement and turned off the furnace, and called the heating repair place.  We're waiting now for the guy to come to check it out.  With the furnace off, but the sun coming in, the temp now is down to 75, so we're still sweltering. 
      Aside from which, nothing doing--Love--Mom 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Luckily, my parents have very wonderful and helpful friends, and it's also good that they keep their sense of humor--though I'm sure that my Mom was swearing at my Dad when it happened! Oy, this getting older stuff isn't easy"

Last Monday all my firewood was delivered, finally. I wanted to get 2 cords this year, but it's a tight fit getting into my driveway, and the truck that can hold 2 cords won't fit into the driveway. So I got 1 1/2 cords (in a smaller truck) and hopefully it will be enough to get me through the winter. Since my yard is so small, the only place for the wood guy to dump all the wood is right where I usually park my car--so that's good incentive for me to get it all stacked. I took a couple of mornings off from work last week to work on it and did a bunch yesterday, then a bit more this morning before it started raining too hard. Certainly getting my exercise--I haul it one armful at a time into my back yard where I dump it in a pile, and then stack it. It's a lot of work, but satisfying to see a nice neat stack growing back there. Hopefully I'll finish it in the next few days. 

Yesterday morning when I went out to work on it, I noticed that my car had one totally flat tire. That tire has had a slow leak for the last few months, but it sure wasn't slow this time! I've had this car for 5 years and have never needed to change a tire, so I wasn't even certain how to use the jack. It didn't help that my neighbor (with whom I share the driveway) was having a tag sale right next to my car, so I provided everyone with some free entertainment as they watched me struggle with the tire. It was stuck somehow--probably rusted into place-- and I tried various methods but couldn't move it, and finally my neighbor offered me a sledge hammer (he called it The Persuader) and a few whacks with that did the trick. I put my little mini-spare tire on and made it to a tire place just before they closed for the day. Turns out there was a nail in the tire, but they fixed it up and sent me on my way. When I got home I started in on the firewood, and so that was the entertainment for the tag sale customers for the next couple of hours. Always happy to keep people entertained--though tires and firewood  don't seem to pay as well as my, ahem, lucrative career in folk music!"

This time it was the Champlain Valley Festival http://www.cvfest.org up in Vermont. The festival takes place at a beautiful state park that's right on Lake Champlain, with views of the Adirondacks off in the distance. It's a tiny festival compared with Falcon Ridge a few weeks ago, but each one is a lot of fun in a different way. The entire main stage including all the audience seating at Champlain fits under a tent  that's about the size of just the dance tent at Falcon Ridge, and there are about 5 or 6 other concert and workshop stages nestled throughout the park. This photo shows the view one morning from the lakeside stage, in between concerts. <br /><br />The weather couldn't have been more perfect--hot and sunny all weekend, but with none of last week's humidity. Camping was in a farmer's field about a mile away, and the group of friends I was camping with managed to set up our tents along a tree line that provided morning shade--usually the tent turns into a little oven as soon as the sun hits in the morning, but the shade made things much more pleasant. During the day  whenever it got too hot after hours of great dancing, we'd all just dive into the lake to cool down. And both Fri and Sat nights after the dancing ended around midnight, a whole bunch of us tromped down to the lake for some skinny dipping under the stars. Sorry, I didn't get any photos of that...........<br /><br />It wasn't easy to leave there late yesterday afternoon to drive back to the ""real world"" but today I still have the sound of fiddles and guitars and accordians wafting through my memory. And so what if I was a zombie at work today--that's what summer is for, right?<br clear=""all"" />"

"event","Well, I certainly picked the wrong weather to schedule having my car at the shop. Living here in the Northeast, all the salt that's spread on roads to melt ice in the winter really does a number on cars, and both of my rear wheel wells are completely rusted out, since that's where the salty slush accumulates. The back bumper isn't actually attached to anything on those sides anymore--not a great safety situation. So last week I arranged to drop the car off at a body shop for a few days, and I planned to ride my bike back and forth between home and work.

My commute is about 4 1/2 miles each way, and it's not too bad a ride except for the hill from hell that awaits me on the ride home. Yesterday was hot but not unbearable, and I huffed and puffed my way up the hill before staggering onto my front porch. Today, however, the temps were up in the high 90's with almost 100% humidity--the air is painfully thick and heavy. And tomorrow is supposed to be the same. So when some friends offered me one of their cars till mine is fixed, it didn't take long for me to accept. They dropped it off at work this afternoon, and so tonight I drove home in a big honking Toyota Highlander. Actually, it's not as big as some of the obscenely huge SUV's out there, but it's massive compared with my little Honda Civic. And though I did feel guilty driving it, it sure was nice to not have to bike up my hill tonight in this heat. Hey, I'm Jewish, I'm used to guilt! By the way, it's almost 11PM and it's still just under 80 degrees outside, and almost as hot and muggy inside. Oy!"

"event","The lack of sleep from this weekend is catching up with me, even though I slept in this morning and took most of the morning off from work. The festival was wonderful, as usual. There were about 45 people sharing our huge campsite, coming and going, hanging out together and sharing many delicious meals. One of the dishes I contributed to Fri night's meal was a  decadent and delicious strawberry tiramisu, which proved to be a big hit. With all the dancing that we do over these four days it doesn't really matter what we eat, since we just dance it all off. Sounds reasonable, no?

I didn't get to the concert stages very much, but there was plenty of great music there all weekend long as well. And at one point late on Sat night we had our own private concert back at our campsite when 3 musicians from some of the best contradance bands in the country stopped by to play tunes together for an hour or so. They're all friends of various people who were part of our camping crowd, and knew that we had a good spot for jamming. Then around 12:30PM we all slogged through the mud to the dance tent to get in another couple hours of dancing to yet another wonderful band. Go, feet, go!

It wouldn't be a folk festival without rain and mud, and both were quite well represented. On Sat afternoon a huge storm blew through with torrential rain, along with plenty of wind and thunder and lightning. I was dancing at the time (surprise!) and on returning to our campsite found that there had been about 4-5"" of water that had flooded through and that many of our tents had literally been floating. Mine was relatively dry inside, and a bunch of us moved up to slightly higher ground, since more storms were predicted for later that afternoon and evening. I emptied my tent and dried things out as much as possible, and felt only slightly soggy that night. All the roads and paths had turned into mud pits, but my Crocs were the perfect shoes for walking and sliding through all that-- tonight I just threw 'em into the sink and scrubbed them clean, and now they're good as new.

Definitely past my bedtime now--maybe by the time I head up to Vermont for the next festival in two weeks I'll have caught up on sleep! G'night.........."

This winter I managed to avoid getting sick, and now here it is July and I'm stuck sniffling and coughing and drinking gallons of hot tea. Go figure. Last night at around 2AM I got up and took some nyquil type stuff that helped me to get some sleep, but today I have no energy and just want to flop down on the couch all day. Not fair, because after all the rainy weather, it's finally a beautiful sunny dry weekend, perfect for hiking or biking. Not for me, alas. Oh well, hopefully in a few days things will be back to normal. Till then, cough cough, sniffle sniffle..........."

"event","For the last week or so it's been hot and wet wet wet here. Even when it hasn't been raining, the air has been heavy and muggy, and things have been feeling mighty tropical. A few days ago I noticed quite a few little black ants in one corner of my kitchen. The I noticed some more along another wall. And more along the bottom of a cabinet. And inside the cabinet. Now, I'm the type of guy who often captures spiders and various other buggy creatures and then lets them go outside, but there's something about lots and lots of ants that makes my bug empathy disappear. 

I stomped on a fair number of them, but there are always dozens more crawling around to replace their fallen comrades. The short term solution is just to take off my glasses so I can't see them, and try to forget about them. But then when I got home late last night Bigley's cat food bowl in the living room was swarming with ants, which really freaked me out. After a fair amount of swearing, I dumped the whole mess in the trash, cleaned out the bowl, and moved on to Plan B. Years ago after an ant invasion in my old apartment, I bought some of those round ant traps that have some kind of poison in them, so last night I found the one remaining trap and set it near a particularly busy ant intersection in one corner of the kitchen floor.  

Well, tonight there seemed to be just as many--or more-- ants in various locations throughout the kitchen, dining room, and living room. I did another round of the stomping dance, and  also spread some borax along where the floor and walls meet, remembering reading somewhere that borax repels ants. But later I vacuumed it all up when Bigley started sniffing at it, not wanting him to get into it. So I guess that tomorrow I'll buy some new little poison-filled ant traps and hope for the best. And in the meantime I'll keep my glasses off when I'm in the kitchen."

I was a bit apprehensive going into it, but it was really good to spend that time with him. And now I also have even more admiration for my Mom, after experiencing just a small sample of what she does day after day after day. He can get out of bed and into the wheelchair by himself and he gets around in the house OK by himself, even though everything takes forever because of how slowly he moves. (But hey, he has no reason to rush, even if he could......) But if he spent a long time in the bathroom I'd find myself worrying and would knock on the door just to make sure that he was OK.  And it was awkward for both of us when I had to help him fasten his Depends--but you do what you gotta do.<br /><br />One afternoon I got all butch and spent a couple of hours down in the cellar building a small ramp so he can wheel himself onto the screened porch off of the living room--he hasn't been able to get out there in over a year. The ramp certainly isn't the most well-built object around, but it's at least functional. And I got to use power tools, yeeha. (Well, one electric saw, anyhow.) Probably the biggest project I've ever done since 8th grade shop class. Some of those items--a breakfast tray, a shoe rack, a step stool-- are still down there in the cellar, lo these many years later.<br /><br />Another afternoon he wanted to visit the cemetary where his parents and aunts are buried-- I hadn't been there since my grandmother's funeral about 22 years ago. After he got out of the car and into the wheelchair, I pushed him over to the section where our relatives are buried. Some of the gravestones were getting overgrown with grass, and the inscription on my grandfather's stone was partially obscured by lichens, so I spent some time cleaning them all off. He said he was OK there, so I wandered off for a few minutes, looking at various names that I recognized from the synagogue when I was growing up. At one point I looked over and saw him sitting there in his wheelchair, lost in his thoughts and memories on that cloudy afternoon, and I felt such tenderness for him. Before we left he asked me to put pebbles on the gravestones, which is a Jewish custom for remembering the dead.<br /><br />But mostly we just spent the time there at the house. He'd sit and read the paper or watch TV or doze, and I kept plenty busy with the daily chores and projects--including trying to better house-train their new dog. We talked on the phone each day with my Mom, who sounded very relaxed for a change. And on Sun morning my younger sister got there for the changing of the guard, and I headed home that afternoon. Didn't realize how exhausted I was till I got home that night, but it's a good exhaustion. And now I'm also happy to be back here in my own house again, and back in my own routine. Good for all of us to have that change of pace once in awhile, I guess.<br clear=""all"" />"

"event","Tomorrow night right after work I'm driving down to CT to Dad-sit for a few days. My older sister in VA had the idea to fly our Mom down there to visit her for 5 days, to give her a bit of a break from her daily routine. She turns 87 in a couple of weeks and takes care of our Dad all by herself, 7 days a week. Luckily she seems to have endless energy, but I don't know how she does it--or how long she'll be able to manage like that. So I'll be there Thurs/Fri/Sat taking care of Dad, and my younger sister will get there on Sun morning to take over for a couple of days. He's in the wheelchair all the time and can manage some things by himself, but it's not safe for him to be alone for more than an hour or two--especially since he's rather stubborn, and *thinks* that he can do more than he actually can. One day when I called last week my Mom was exhausted from pushing him back up their driveway--he'd rolled himself down, but then couldn't manage to get back up by himself. Oy. 

At some point he'll probably have to move back into the nursing home for real, though at least for now it seems like they'll be able to continue like this for awhile. I wish that they/we could afford in-home care, but unfortunately it's simply too expensive. So it's going to be an adventure for the next few days--wish us all good luck!"

I drove up near the summit of Greylock and then hiked down a few miles (hmmmm, that seems backwards...........) to get to March Cataract Falls. Lots of wildflowers blooming all along the trail, and near the falls it was nice and cool with plenty of shade and spray from the water. Along the trail to the falls I stopped and dug up a bunch of ramps at my favorite spot where I've gotten them for the last 17 or 18 years, and my backpack was good and aromatic for the rest of the hike.<br /><br />Heading back up to the car I was getting pretty hot--still no leaves on the trees up that high, so there was no shade. Temps were up in the 80's. Hard to believe that only a week ago it was in the 30's and 40's and I had the woodstove going. <br /><br />At one point as I was walking along, 2 fighter jets went zooming loudly overhead, presumably on some training exercise. They were soon gone and I continued hiking through the buccolic woods, but it made me think of how terrifying that sound must be for so many people in this world, people who can't just go on with their peaceful walks in the woods. On this Memorial Day weekend, my thoughts turn to all those who have died in wars, military and civilians. Human beings, each and every one, with families, friends, dreams........As the song says, when will we ever learn?<br clear=""all"" />"

"event","Another cold, rainy weekend. Other than one partly sunny day this last week, it's been raining almost non-stop for the last few weeks. Starting to feel just a bit waterlogged. This afternoon I spent about an hour working out in the garden while getting rained on, but I picked up a few new perennials at yesterday's garden club plant sale, and wanted to get them in the ground. I also pulled up lots of spearmint and peppermint, both of which are starting to take over the yard. Nice plants, but they spread like crazy and are too much of a good thing. The spearmint originally came from my Mom's garden, and some friends gave me the peppermint a few years ago.

This spring I've been frustrated by some obnoxious neighborhood kids who go tromping through my garden looking for the ball that they keep hitting there. I've tried talking with them and with their parents, but without much success. The houses and yards are very close together here and there's really not enough space to be playing ball. I don't want to get the reputation as the crabby neighbor, but I'm tired of seeing my garden trampled. I've been thinking about maybe planting some poison ivy in that area, hehheh......

The temperature outside was hovering in the low 40's all afternoon, and it's about 42 right now. Cold and damp enough that I've had the woodstove going all day--it's nice just to take the chill off things. Big vase of purple lilac on the dining room table and the woodstove going in the next room. Welcome to spring in New England."

I arrived in Kona on a Wed night and felt totally out of it when I got there. Possibly that was related to the 16 hours of traveling and the fact that it was about 2:30AM my time, but who knows......<br /><br />That night I stayed at a hostel in Kona which was populated by the usual eclectic mix of characters found in hostels. I shared a bunk room with two other guys--one was a hot 20-something German guy who, on Thurs morning, stripped down to his shorts and proceeded to rub sunblock all over his body as we carried on a conversation about traveling. I should have offered to help him, but being the shy and retiring fellow that I am, I missed my opportunity.<br /><br />After breakfast a bunch of us from the hostel walked down to the bay and jumped into the water--nice way to start off the day! Most of the others went for a serious swim, but I was content just to splash around there by the beach for awhile. I wandered around Kona for a couple of hours, bought some bananas at a farmer's market and had my first cup of Kona coffee, and then eventually walked back to the hostel, packed up the car, and started heading south along the coast.<br /><br />It was sunny and hot when I left Kona, but it got more and more cloudy as I went south, with on and off rain showers through the day. Driving along, I was constantly amazed at the landscape of ocean, palm trees, lava fields and steep mountains, all so completely different from this corner of New England. My friends live near the town of Naalehu near the southern tip of the island, but they weren't going to be home till late afternoon, so I drove down to South Point, which is the southernmost point in the US (despite what Key West might claim!) Later I read that rental cars aren't supposed to be driven on the road to South Point. Oh well...... By the time I got there it was incredibly windy and the rain was coming down in sheets, but it was still an amazing view, with waves crashing onto the black lava cliffs. Glad I had my raincoat!<br /><br />During the next few days my friends were great tour guides and we drove around to various spots to see the sights. A major storm system seemed to be parked right over Hawaii, so unfortunately it was cloudy and rainy for almost the whole week that I was there. Luckily though, the Big Island didn't have any major flooding like what took place on some of the other islands, especially Kauai. One day we did actually have some sunshine as we drove up north of Kona to the town of Puako, where my friend Laura's brother lives. That afternoon we did some splashing around in a little cove--we'd planned to go snorkling, but the water was too choppy. Just being in the Pacific was enough for me though! It was clear enough at that point that we could look out to the northwest and see Maui off in the distance--I thought of you j2!<br /><br />That night we had a picnic supper along the water while listening to a concert of Hawaiian slack-key guitar music at one of the resorts near Puako. Each month on the Sat night closest to the full moon there's a program of Hawaiian music or storytelling or other cultural event, and we happened to be there on the right weekend for it. Quite a magical and relaxing evening, listening to the lovely music, watching some women get up from the audience to do hula dancing (no men doing it, dammit!) and listening to the waves rolling onto the lava beach.<br /><br />Since it was so late when things ended, a neighbor of Laura's brother offered us the use of their guesthouse for the night so we wouldn't have to drive the almost 3 hours back to Tom and Laura's house. It was a lovely spacious house right on the beach, and probably worth well over $1,000,000--and we had it to ourselves for free--how cool is that?? I sat out on the beach for awhile that night, looking out at the Pacific as the waves crashed in, phosphorescent in the moonlight. The next morning we ate our breakfast out on the beach too, and saw a whale way off in the distance, surfacing and diving, surfacing and diving.<br /><br />More traveling around during the next few days, up along the northern coast to the Pololu Valley Lookout, more amazing vistas at every turn. The next day we headed up (in altitude) to Volcano National Park, but unfortunately the clouds were so thick and it was raining so hard that we never got much of a view of the craters, steam vents, or active lava flows. My friends, however, assured me that they really do exist. Hmmm, not sure if I believe them. Same as I don't really believe everyone who said ""Oh, this weather is really unusual!"" The day I drove up to Hilo was pretty much a washout, with virtually no end to the heavy pouring rain, so I decided not to bother heading north of there to see the waterfalls and valleys that are supposed to be so scenic. But despite all that, the views were still always incredible and it was great just to be there, soaking it all in.<br /><br />Next time I'll definitely have to plan to stay longer, and I'll also try to reserve some sunny weather (and see some of those hula boys!) But in the meantime, I'll drink another cup of Kona coffee and say a fond aloha to you all.<br /><br />(Some of you have already seen the photos that I put on Snapfish, but if you haven't, let me know and I'll email you the info for it.)<br clear=""all"" />"

"event","Tomorrow night after work I'm driving down to CT to stay with my parents.  Since they live about 50 minutes from Bradley Airport,I won't have to get up at some ungodly hour on Wed morning and drive there from here.  I leave Bradley around 10AM, fly to Chicago, then LAX, and finally arrive in Kona about 9:30PM their time. That's 2:30AM my time, so I'll be pretty zombied out by then. That night I have a reservation at a hostel in Kona, then on Thursday I'll drive down to the southern tip of the island to where my friends live. When we talked a few days ago they said it's been raining every day for the past few weeks, and the weather report says that it's supposed to rain pretty much every day for at least the next 4 or 5 days. But, hey, at least it'll be tropical Hawaiin rain! Talk with you all in about a week and a half!"

He had a big tumor in his mouth and it was getting more and more difficult for him to eat, and he seemed to be in pain. I visited them this past weekend and he was still eating OK and acting pretty normal at that point, but my Mom said that he got much worse in these last few days. It's always such a hard decision to have to make-- we get so attached to our pets. Jack was around 11 years old, and especially during the last year and a half as my parents have had their own health problems, he was a real comfort and companion for them. We're all going to miss him. Hope he's happy and comfortable now up in that big dog house in the sky..........<br clear=""all"" />"

"event","This morning I got to experience one of everyone's favorite activities..........I had a dentist appointment. Now, I'm not lucky like Pebs to have a hunky looking dentist-- mine is sort of obnoxious and ugly and has a big paunch. Usually though, he only sees me for about 30 seconds anyway, and the hygienist does all the real work, so it's OK. Today I had a new hygienist and she was quite pleasant, and more importantly, she was very careful--not like the Hygienist From Hell who cleaned my teeth last time. That time, my teeth and gums were sore for days from all of her sadistic poking and jabbing with sharp objects. Today's hygienist used some new fangled ultrasonic tool for the cleaning--better than the scrape scrape scraping with the evil looking tool that they've always used in the past. I'm such a wimp when it comes to pain and dentist chairs, but today wasn't too bad. Worse than the physical pain though was when I had to pay the bill. I don't have dental insurance, so three cheers for the Visa card!

And my Visa card has been getting quite a workout lately. I recently made vacation plans--one month from right now I'll be in Hawaii, yeeha! Some friends of mine moved there about a year ago and they have a guest room, so I'm taking them up on their offer of a place to stay. I found some ""cheap"" airfare through Travelocity and booked my flight a couple of weeks ago. It's going to be tough to miss a week of New England mud season, but I'll try my best to enjoy Hawaii. Since I'm going all that distance I wanted to stay for longer than a week, but unfortunately the cheap airfare wasn't available on the other dates that I checked. But even a week in paradise will be a treat.  As I'm typing this it's 17 degrees outside and I just heard a snowplow drive by. My friends sent me a guidebook for the Big Island to peruse, and it's been fun to look through it on these cold winter nights. Anyone want to stow away in my suitcase.....?"

It was just a few of their friends and my aunt & uncle, along with a decadent  chocolate cake that I baked. He doesn't get out of the house much these days except for doctors' appointments, so he enjoyed seeing everyone. When I got home last night he'd left a message on my answering machine thanking me and saying ""See you here at the same time next year""--awww, brought a tear to my eye.<br clear=""all"" />"

It was a big crowd of people mostly from the contra dance world, and it was a relaxing way to spend the afternoon. Plenty of delicious food, and it's winter so it's OK to eat lots--we have to stay warm, right? A couple of friends were playing tunes on fiddle and guitar, and I was kicking myself for not bringing along my instrument. This morning I felt too lazy and didn't want to spend the time tuning it. Oh well........<br /><br />We got a few inches of snow during the night and it was beautiful driving up into the hills today. I was mostly on winding backroads, passing through some of the little hilltowns that I used to live in over the years, so my mind was filled with memories of the past as well as those ""OhmyGod it's really 2006!"" kind of thoughts.<br /><br />Last night I went to a small party at some friends' closer to home. We spent the evening eating and singing and playing music (hence the out of tune strings this morning.....) No one was watching the clock, so midnight somehow snuck by without our noticing. But despite the belated Auld Lang Syne and champagne, 2006 seems to have started all by itself.<br /><br />Happy New Year to you all!<br clear=""all"" />"

Granted, when you scoop a big blob of cement onto the trowel, there's inevitably going to be some that slops off, but she seemed to show quite a lot of glee every time blobs of cement splatted down onto her big brother who was so very kindly helping her out that day, hrumph! <br /><br />As you can see, there's still a LOT of work to go, but hopefully the whole house will get at least the first layer of cement on it before winter weather stops the work. Unfortunately I probably won't be able to get out there to help her again for awhile, but eventually it's going to be a really cool house.<br clear=""all"" />"

OK, no jokes about the 3 little pigs and huffing and puffing and blowing the house down. This is one solid house, or at least it will be once it's finished. It has a wood frame sort of like most conventional houses, but then the spaces between the framing are filled with stacked straw bales, which are then covered with layers of adobe-like cement. I was there to act butch and help slather cement onto the walls. Yeeha!<br clear=""all"" />"

"event","We got almost 6"" of rain here in the last few days. It rained steadily without stopping all day yesterday, and there were quite a few torrential downpours at various times. Late in the afternoon I noticed that water was starting to collect in my cellar, which happens every so often. The front portion of the cellar has a dirt floor so whatever water collects there eventually is just absorbed back into the ground. But it was raining so hard yesterday that the ground was totally saturated and the water was seeping and pouring into the cellar from various points in the stone foundation. I keep some plastic milk crates down there and turned them upside down, using them as stepping stones to get to the back part of the cellar, which has a cement floor and is about 8"" higher up, and was still dry at that point.

A few hours later though while I was making supper, I heard a strange noise coming from downstairs--turns out it was the sump pump which is in that back part of the cellar. In the 6 1/2 years that I've lived here it's only gone on once before, and I hadn't had reason to look at it recently. Ooops, that was a mistake, because there was a split in the hose, so every time the pump went on, water was spraying everywhere. After carefully unplugging the pump, I wrapped the broken part of the hose with duct tape (where would we be without duct tape??) and started it back up again. By then the water in the dirt-floored section had risen to about 3-4"" and it was getting near the hot water heater, so I took out a portable sump pump that I'd never used before. Unfortunately it needed a hose and a heavy extension cord, so I jumped in the car and rushed off to Walmart (boo, hiss.......) Not where I'd like to be on a Saturday night, but the other hardware store was already closed for the night. Some of the roads were flooding but I splashed my way through, and before long I was back home with both pumps running, and after an hour or so it looked like a cellar again instead of a swimming pool. The automatic pump kept going on periodically all night long, but eventually the rain let up, and by this morning things didn't look too bad down there. Anyone want to play in the mud?

Luckily this was just an inconvenience and not all that serious, though it did get my adrenalin pumping. But thinking about all the damage from Katrina and Rita, the earthquake in Pakistan and India, and the flooding in Guatemala, I have nothing to complain about-- I can deal with a soggy cellar."

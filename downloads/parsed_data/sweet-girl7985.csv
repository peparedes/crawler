anyway, I am trying to figure out how to write a spell for memory lose. Its to damn late to write it now though. 

Lately more things have been comming true then ever and it scars me so badly. I know I have had an ability sense I was 10, but the last few weeks have been wierd. I need more medatation... 
Its so freaking hard find a good time to do that though sense we have such load fucking drug addicts that walk up and down the stairs every hour going to my naighbors house to go get them. 


I know I am tired but I really need to say something before I go to bed. I am bothered more and more about why Tom doesnt trust me. He has no reason to not trust me. I have never fucking done anything behind his back. And I was talking to crystal about it and she told me maybe its guilt. I am wondering more and more about what I found in my room about 4 -5? months ago... 
And its been really fucking getting to me because of Toms attitude. 
Candi Told me not to worry about it. I have not done anything and wont. And she was completely honest with me when she said this: If he has not trusted me after 2 years he may not ever trust me. And you know what... I am glad that I have someone that is honest with me and does not suger coat everything. 


I hope this all made sense.. I might be back tommorrow to write out more.. never know."

I found out that Tom does not hate Onna after all. He just knows that she has had druggys around there and does not want the same thing to happen that happened with Kristen. I see so many diffrences between those 2 its not even funny. Well she is going threw alot right now and I tryed to give her some advice but I dont think it really helped. The only thing is is I dont know if I wanna get to close to her because I have the worst luck with friends my own age (except crystal and richard and jacki) all the rest have burned me so badly. Thats why I dont like to be around to many ppl my own age around here. Anyway I just hope that Onna does not turn out to be like someone that is going to lye and steal from me. I hope that shes honest with me thats all I ask in a friend. 
Something (among the many) I relized last night was the fact that I HATE being by myself for a long period of time. I fucking hate it. And I know that when I am by myself for a long period of time I go nuts and thats one of the reasons I flip out on Tom so much. Cause I have a lot of pent up emotions when I am alone. And I think alot. More then you would know. And I dont like that. I like talking to ppl, I love being around them if its the right ppl. 
You know next to Jessica, my best friends are in there 40s. And tom asked me once why. And I said I want nothing to do with ppl my own age cause 99% of them do drugs. And no I am not exagerating. Well I gotta go."

I'm not a perfect person
As many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
and the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new

I can't stop thinking bout you
My head is spinning round

And everyminute of every single day
I'm dreaming of how it could be
And everynight before I go to sleep
I'm praying that soon you'll be here with me

I don't know what to do
I hold my pillow but I wanna be holding you
And when close my eyes I always see your face
I know my happiness is only kiss away
And every hour here in the dark
Everyday of my lonely heart
Tells me that I need to be with you
Heaven oh heaven what can I do

Heaven, heaven oh heaven can't you help me
I'm giving my love for eternity
Heaven oh heaven can't you help me
I'm down on my knees help me

Girl I'd give anything if you were here with me
Give anything you want and anything you need
I never thought that I could feel the way I do
But now I wanna spend the rest of my with you
And every day that we are apart
I'm shedding this love here in my heart
And everynight before I go to sleep

And I hope that when I go to my apointment that he can actually help me, because I am tierd of not having a full time job, I am tierd of being used like a dog like Lana is. I need to find something. And if and when I go to shrinners I am nervious about what they have to say about what can be done with my back. 
I want to be well, I dont want to have to wake up and be sore and be in pain. Its been about a year and a half now sense I have been in pain everyday, and its getting harder and harder to remember what its like to not be in pain. 
I hope that I can get the help that I need. 
Well I have desided that I am probably not going to delete this journal, just modify it a bit. Delete some of the entrys that I find shouldnt be on the internet anymore. I might create another journal, but I dont know what about yet. I am almost certain that it will be an online B.O.S. because I really need to start practicing and studying again. I feel happy when I do, and feel a hell of a lot better about things as well, meaning when I meditate. Anyway, I have rambeled on a bit, so I am going to go and check out whats going on with the Zen Hex for a bit. 
Peace"

I graduated High School with a little less then a 3.0, I am still with Tom, and I have my family still. Yeah thats about all I can say thats actually really good things. Oh and a new kitty cat.
The Bad: 
I got fired from 3 jobs, none that were my fault, and no I am not JUST saying that, ask me later for the full story. 
Yeah theres more but it would bore the hell out of you so I will spare you. 
I really just hope that next year I will get to acomplish these things:
Get my fucking drivers license FINNALLY! 
Get married to Tom, FINNALLY! 
And find a good job that I can actually keep.

"event","Man I wish I could explain how my mind is working right now. Yesterday I started having flashbacks (Good ones)of some memories that I couldnt remember tell now. Its a very fuzzy memory though. But I know it happened. I just cant remember how, before or after. Or who I was with. And then today I started having some memories come back to me that I had forgotten about an X friend that desided to FUCK ME OVER badly. But thats not the point. The point is that I remember then now. 
I remember how me and her used to write combining storys all the time, and whatnot. It may not be anything exciting, but its something. 

I did though have one of the worst fucking dreams I have had in about 2 months. I was in my old house in Arizona, and it was part house, part shopping mall. Well in this scene, I am with some friends (dont know who) and there are some people out side our door (Mall) and they want to kill us. There was this awful gun fight, and I got shot in the side of the head, But then the next thing is that I was trying on clothes when someone said they were back. So I had to put the tank top down, and ran upstairs (ecalator/stairs) of the house (Mall) and go to my paents bed room and grabed my gun. We all had to be quite and I looked at the mirror that was behind the bed, and my face, my face had a a bullet hole that healed over. Its the wierdest thing, I cant desribe it. 
and then the killers came and we had to anialate them. I and I think 2 others survived. 

I was really scared when I woke up. Why the hell do I have these fucking dreams? There terrorizing me. Really terrifying."

"event","God I cant fucking believe what I did at work today. Our dishwasher broke, so we have to do everything by hand. Well I was adjusting the buckets of water and I actidently slamed the diswasher door on my finger when I moved the bucket, jaring the door. It was gushing and I was in agony. I used 5 bandaids in less then 20 minutes it was so bad. I looked at my finger more closly later and saw I tore something in side my finger open. Its had it explain. It looks horrable. I cant even fucking move it.
Sorry I am cursing so much, but it hurts more then my back does on most days!
Anyway, I cant get this dream out of my head and I dont know what it means. I was in this house that was 4 stories tall, and I think it was right across the street from my old house in Arizona. Well I am on flat land, while this house is on a hill. Well, I am the house that I used to live in, and all the sudden I hear a warning to evacuate the street because a earthquake was comming. 
Well it sure as hell hit. I am feeling the earchquake hit, while I am screaming at the people to get out. I cant see inside the house, like threw the walls, watching this family screaming in terror as they come down the hallway. The house is commin apart with them in it. The wierdest thing is the FIRST floor comes apart while the family is still on the second. They get out as the whole house is falling right down the side of the hill. And this house is the only one on the street to fall or hit. 
I dont wanna go on. Well that was just the first of a number of dreams I will put in later. Gotta go."

Hello. Welcome to The Complete and Utter Idiot's Guide to Making a
Baloney and Cheese Sandwich. Ready for Lunch? Good! Let's begin!
We're going to start our journey by assuming that you already possess
each of the individual items you'll be needing to make this sandwich.
It's a bit of a stretch, I know, but Lord knows we don't have time to
take you shopping.
So, that said, the first thing you're gonna need is a place to make
your sandwich. My suggestion would be a plate. So reach into your
cupboard and grab a plate. Any will do. No, that's a bowl. Plates are
flat. Right, yes, that's flat, but it's a cutting board. Plates are
going to be round. Yes the bowl is round, but it's not flat, is it?
Just.. Christ, forget it. Grab that cutting board you had in your
hands. Perfect. Put it down.
On the counter, not the floor.
Much better. Alright, you're ready to start. You need bread.
Personally, I prefer either wheat or sourdough, but you might prefer
white, rye, pumpernickel, a French roll...you're just staring at me.
What do you mean you don't have any bread like that? Like what? What
kind of bread do you have?
Wonder. Fine, it's pre-sliced.
Take out two slices of Wonder Bread. Two. More than one, less than
three. That's three. Put one back. Perfect. Place your two slices of
Wonder Bread on your cutting board. See how easy this is?
OK, you need some sandwich ingredients, open your refrigerator.
Your refrigerator. Big thing in your kitchen. Stores food. Yes, and
beer, too. That's the one.
Take out the cheese, the baloney, the mayo...you're giving me that
look again. Let's stop there. Cheese, baloney and mayo. Mayonnaise.
It's a sandwich spread. White. No, that's Miracle Whip. Yes, it's a
white sandwich spread but.. fine. Miracle Whip will do. Put it on the
counter next to the bread.
OK. Now we...where's the cheese and baloney? Didn't I just say... uhg!
Go back to the refrigerator and.. no, leave the Miracle Whip where it
is, just go back to the fridge and open it. Good. Grab the cheese. Any
kind will do. Oh Jesus, just pick one!
No, that's brie. It doesn't go well with baloney. What the Hell are
you doing with brie?
How about cheddar, do you have cheddar? It's probably orange. Yes!
That's cheddar! Bring it to the counter next to cutting board. Now go
back to the fridge. I'm sorry, are you getting dizzy? It can happen,
get used to it. Open the fridge again. You're looking for baloney. God
willing, it'll be pre-sliced. Baloney. It's meat. You're looking for a
package filled with slices of meat.
That's bacon.
Yes! That's the baloney! Very good! Now bring that over to the food.
No, we're done with the fridge, you'll just throw out whatever you
don't use, I can't bear to go through the fridge disaster again.
OK, now you're ready to start making a baloney and cheese sandwich.
Open the Miracle Whip. Open it. Twist the lid off of the jar. What do
you mean it won't come off? Twist the other direction. There ya go!
Now you need a knife.
Oh God.
You don't need a sharp knife, you just need a spreading knife. Dull.
Very dull. The duller the better. No! Not that! Put that down before
you kill someone! Try to find a knife without a wooden handle. No,
that has a wooden handle doesn't it? That probably means it's sharp.
Don't test it to see! Just put it down! Find a dull, regular, boring
knife!
OK. Perfect. That's a nice simple spreading knife. Dip it into the
Miracle Whip. Now lift it out of the Miracle Whip and spread it on the
slices of bread. Carefully. Not too hard, you'll tear the bread.
Harder than that. The knife has to at least touch the bread to leave the spread.
There ya go. Now do the other slice of bread. Perfect! You're a
regular Julia Childs now!
She's a famous cook....nevermind.
Now your bread is spread. Quit giggling. You are going to place a
slice of baloney on one piece of bread. Open the package. No, this
package doesn't screw open. Just pull the back end away from the rest
of the package. See how it's opening up? Excellent. Take out a slice
of baloney. Place it on one of the slices of bread. No, you don't need
the knife for this.
Good! You're almost there! Now it's time to cut the cheese.
I said stop giggling.
The cheese is unopened? OK, don't panic. Take the dull knife.. the
other end, grab the other end of the knife! Slice the package of
cheese open. Just jam it in there and.. don't worry about hurting the
cheese! Just slice the damn thing open!
Very good, you're getting to be really good with the knife. Lord help us all.
Now take the block of cheese out and lay it on the counter. Just lay
it on the counter, who cares if it's dirty! Like you're gonna be
living long at this rate anyway! OK. Again with the knife, cut
yourself a few slices of cheese. Thinner than that, you want more than
two slices out of your block. Thinner. Thinner. Thinner!
Just...measure with your pinky! Your pinky should be at least two
slices thick. What are you...DON'T SLICE YOUR PINKY!!! God!
You know what? Forget it! Throw the cheese away. Throw it away! You're
just having a baloney sandwich today, I can't deal with this. Don't
look at me like that, throw the cheese in the garbage!
Now pick up one slice of bread and put it down on the other. Miracle
Whip-side down. Well turn it over, you can't eat a sandwich with the
Miracle Whip side facing out!
Because I said so!!!
OK. Pick up the sandwich.
Congratulations! You've made a Baloney Sandwich! Dufus."

So anyway, Last night I started crying because I have been getting wierd thoughts in my head, and everything kept going a million miles an hour. And I didnt know how to stop them. I took some deep breathes but that didnt help. I dont know why. I keep thinking on all the reasons I am starting to go threw this shit again with my head. Its like a battle with myself and I dont know why. I guess because I am depressed about getting a job, and thinking that Tom doesnt care, and all this shit. I got that feeling last night when I started to talk to him about it but he just went right back to the computer. I started curseing the computer because its all he fucking cares about when he is on it. I mean am I supost to just say nothings wrong when I am asked?
Here I go again! This is just mior to the things that go threw my head now. I really need to find something to help this. Maybe anxioty pills or something. God I just wanna think about my classes that I am going to start next week. That will take my mind off of a lot. Well anyway, gotta go back to filling out this paperwork."

I am going to take the office classes so I can find a nice office job, and then hopefully I will take classes for computer design along the road. I need to find out the first classes also that I need for that to prepare. 
But hey I hope it works out. I really want this currer, something in the technology field.  I just dont like putting all the pressure on Tom becuase I have no job. 
I was PISSED 2 days ago, he told his aunt that he already asked his boss for a second job. Why would this piss me off you ask? Because his body can barly handle the one job hes got, how the fuck is he gonna come home, rest and then have enough engery to work again at night? HE FUCKING CANT! 
And that would make me feel like such SHIT you dont even know. God I am trying, but I am never chossen because of my lack of experience. God what the hell am I supost to do? We probably wont have money for anything next month except our bills and then nothing for the rest of the month. And he owes his mom or Dave 100 dollers he borrowed this weekend. 
Yeah I feel horrable."

But hey who knows. I couldnt sleep for shit last night which is no suprise. I cant keep taking these damned sleeping pills eaither or my body might start to depend on them to get to sleep and I dont want that. I just wanna fucking go to sleep and not wake up tell morning. IS THAT SO MUCH TO ASK?
I guess this is Gods way of saying HA HA fucker! 
I am getting depressed again, and I dont want that either. I just wish that I knew how I can talk to Tom, he is so impossable sometimes it drives me crazy. I just dont know why its so hard for him to just tell me how he feels sometimes and just open up. I guess its a lost cause for now. But how long will it take for me to get shit threw his head? 1 month? 1 year? 10 years? 
He mentioned me getting a job, it was more of a joke, which is hard to explain, but something clicked and I started crying. I cant stand this anymore. Most of the time I wish I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth. Doesnt everyone...
Well I gotta go get ready for this fucking class."

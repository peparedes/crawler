"event","Hey everyone, I guess I should start out by telling you all a little bit about me. My name is Kasey Sheridan, I'm in the group dream. I replaced Melissa, and I'm so happy that I can be part of this group with three amazing girls. I have 2 old sisters and 1 older brother.  There isn't really a lot to tell about me, I mean, if you want to know anything, just ask.

So right now I have no real dramatic things happening in my life, which is a good thing, I hate people who overstress their lives with drama. It's just stupid. In life you're supposed to have fun, not be filled full of hatred and drama.

Sorry this update was short but I don't really have anything to write about right now. So yeah, hit me up <b>CrazyKaseyDream</b> and comment this. Welcome me :-*
<3 Kinky K (Haha, right Dirrrrrty D?)"

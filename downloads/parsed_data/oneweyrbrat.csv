Niklo sighs happily as she watches Tzivya and her lifemate leave the sands, then goes back to watching again. Overhearing Kamia's comment the girl grins mischiviously. ""Guess ya wouldn't say that if y'got trampled by one, eh?"" She winks.

Kamia blinks in shock at the little dark green. ""Right Naurimeth.. we better get you something to eat.. why are you laughing at me?"" She can't help it though, she smiles, breaking the ranks to move to dragon.

Tolemic spares a moment from his own sands-watching to study Madge and her nibbling. ""You're all right,"" he offers with another quick grin. ""Just keep your eyes open and your feet moving."" Which his own are doing, shuffling deeper into the little hollow he's already created.

Nolee shakes her head again, missing the hatching and moving about of the brown dragon with the attitude. ""Noo, noo. Not just before the humming. Ages before. We've been on our toes, you know."" She nods importantly, then just looks confused by his pretend-pride. ""Um...yeh."" The girl finally agrees, her eyes scanning over the candidates. ""Aww, was that another one paired?""

K'ylon tugs himself into a semblance of dignity and steps toward Kamia. ""Naurimeth is it? Well done, Kamia, follow me."" He leads the newly impressed pair to the corner.
<b>
Opening Night Jitters Egg trembles and twitches repeatedly, moving about in its raised mound of sand. A small fight, and soon a lanky, egg-goo covered bronze hatchling tumbles forth. He blunders along in his search for the right one, owlish eyes blink almost comically as he makes a serious consideration of a short, roly-poly girl with brown hair, snorting thick mucus all over her robe as he prods her tummy. And passes her by. Then a sudden shriek, and he launches himself at a tall, blonde-haired girl...knocking her down and barely missing stepping on her as he falls face-first at the feet of that handsome, arrogant youth from Nerat. Draconic eyes look up in adoration, and the boy appears stunned and disbelieving as he steps forward, murmuring soft words to his new weyrmate.</b>

Amira shrugs at Kaelana. ""They were the ones being indescisive. Those are the ones I think are dangerous."" She now also keeps her eyes on the brown, as he starts getting ready to move.

Tannim now stands semi alone the girls on either side having both now impressed green. The look on his face however is one over joy, ""Kamia, she is beautiful. Oh I am so happy for you.""

Madge eyes Tannim, her thumb pressed in between her lips. Removing it, she speaks. ""No thanks. Just fine over here."" And not over /there/, thanks, where people are getting plucked up and carried off like fish from a pond. Tolemic's advice is heeded, but her eyes have dropped to his own feet. ""You're gonna bury yourself."" That said, back to fidgeting, her eyes on Kamia and her new lifemate.

Kamia places a hand gently on the dragon smiling a goofy amused grin as she walks with the dragon. ""K'ylon knows where the food is.

Kamia walks down to the far end of the Cavern.
Kamia has left.

Naurimeth walks down to the far end of the Cavern.
Naurimeth has left.

Illatus grins as the Headstrong green seems to have decided to chosen. He lets out another encouraging whoop, ""Yay, Kamia,"" he calls out to the girl, returning his eyes to the eggs just in time to see the bronze hatch and impress. ""There's a bronze,"" he comments.

K'ylon walks down to the far end of the Cavern.
K'ylon has left.

Balinne walks over from the far end of the Hatching Cavern.
Balinne has arrived.
<b>
The Powdered Wig Egg shudders lastly, sending up fine dust from a shell fairly disintegrating from around a curled green form within. Though all of the commotion her egg's undergone was only the result of her stretching limbs and nudging nose, it takes her a moment to realize her freedom and, blinking, step free of her gooey confines to consider the new world revealed.</b>

<div align=""center""><b>                          Lively Alpine Meadow Green                          
</b></div><b>The vibrant green of a grassy alpine meadow paints this dragon evenly from her pert muzzle to her long, agile tail. A swath of iced sage crests under her neck, then fans out into splatters along her slender underbelly. That same paleness, the color of the snowcapped mountains, dapples her peaked neckridges and highlights petite, rounded headknobs. Beneath neatly defined, frosted browridges, close-set eyes often sparkle with friendly wisdom. Her wings are like mountains themselves, though verdant instead of snowy; the spars arch high even when folded back. Translucent sails descend from them in gracious, windswept falls that play warm or cool, sunny or icy, according to the nature of the light shimmering through them. Her lean muscles ripple with the promise of strength. Lithe and graceful, she is all clean lines and kinetic energy.</b>


Tolemic looks at Niklo and Madge as Kamia's escorted off the sands. ""That was Kamia, right? What'd she say her green's name was?"" Trust him to remember the name of a girl.

Niklo's words ae no sooner out of her mouth than the very person she's speaking to Impresses. ""Well,"" she says, snickering softly, ""Guess you won't be gettin' trampled this time around. Way t'go, Kamia!"" Hopping from foot to foot excitedly, she nods to Tolemic. ""Kamia, yup! And Naurimeth!""

Fadra watches K'ylon take the green away with a quiet twist of the lips, content to let him go and instead watch the prowl of that brown, whose curiousity in the candidates has her bouncing just on the balls of her feet, on edge.

Kaelana nods, the comment deemed appropriate, ""I don't think much of them are ones for decisiveness, but it's good to be on edge. I agree."" She takes a shuffle to the left, the wince returning as the sand in her sandels scratches over now raw feet.

Illatus watches as the powdered wig egg hatches into another green, ohing at the grace of the creature as she breaks free of her shell. ""Such a pretty egg, that was,"" he says, grinning around him, ""Guess beauty breed beauty, eh?""

<b>Shrewd Savannah Brown is pacing the line, a slinky prowl with his head low to the ground and his hindquarters bobbing slightly as he wanders around the people. Why are they in his way? Well, maybe this will move them. With a baring of clean, white, still-formidable baby fangs, the brown snarls towards his opposition. He stalks back and forth, looking for a through-way, stopping only once, to look perturbed, before heading back the opposite direction. There's got to be an exit somewhere.</b>

Tannim watches as a bronze finally hatches and as quickly as he does he has found his lifemate. He cheers for the candidate who had bunked next to him and smile, calling over congratulations. He shrugs towards Madge then, ""Ok, suit yourself."" His attention though is once again drawn back to the eggs as another green emerges.

Balinne returns to the Sands, looking a little drunken. She's not, of course, drunk. But she is still grinning like an idiot.

Madge will suit herself, thank you very much, and remain right /here/. And completely miss the brown's fang-baring, though the reactions of others draw her attention. Her expression is one of bemusement. Why're they so scared? Why is /she/ so scared? No! Nervous. Right. With a decisive nod to finalize that inner outcome, she resumes nibbling away at her fingers.

Fadra looks at the returning Balinne with a quiet smirk. ""I bet her glee is just /paralyzing/,"" the brownrider murmurs, craning her head around her approaching staff to narrow her eyes at the brown. ""Watch that one,"" she warns the candidates in a tone so low they'll likely not hear her.

<b>One by one the lights that glare all over the Thousand Burning Lamps Egg go out. Wink after wink leaves the shell in increasing darkness, its gloss fading beneath a thin layer of leaking egg-goo, its source a crack growing at the eggs odd apex.</b>

Amira smiles at Kaelana. ""And it helps you know if you've Impressed sooner."" She laughs and turns back to the hatchlings. She stops short as she sees the brown snarling. ""Yeah, dangerous.""

Tolemic huhs? over at Madge. ""Bury myself? Oh hey, look at that brown."" He misses the bronze's hatching and Impression to watch the irritated brown, even going so far as to step forward, out of his sandy depression. His stillness lasts for only a few seconds before he's shuffling again.

<b>Shrewd Savannah Brown looks beyond frustrated - with his neck arched, he looks down his nose towards the band of white-things blocking him in, and then back towards his parents. Must I /really/ go on with this nonsense? Then, suddenly, his head jerks back around, to the side he lingered at only moments ago. As though he's attached to a leash that's been suddenly tugged, he slinks closer to the candidates, stopping in front of a girl with dark shaggy hair and brown eyes that hold the same sharp glint as his own.</b>

Brighid's eyes widen and she almost takes a step farther back from the snarling brown hatchling. Visibly steeling herself, she streightens her shoulders and holds her ground, obviously determined that she's not going to show just how scared she really is, though she looks ready to bolt at a moment's notice.

""I think it was - and there, another,"" V'lano replies, distracted for a time by the movements of the brown who's taken so much longer than his hidemates out of these shells have done to choose. The weyrleader does lift a lazy hand to flicker fingers by way of an indicative point. ""Oh,"" he adds then, drawing the hand back to shield his eyes from glare, even with Volath's shadow there to help. ""It's my favorite."" Wry, that.

Madge holds no ground against this sudden invasion. Powerless, unsuspecting, she's well and truly caught by the brown dragon, small and fierce, that's claimed her. Her hands fall to her sides and she stares. A wince, her face pinching, and she doubles over. ""Takavath,"" is her gasp, her arm around her middle while her other hand reaches for him. /Him/.

If it were dignified, Fadra would fall over. ""Oh, Faranth. What'd I do t'deserve this class? Am I a bad person?"" she asks of no one in particular. And her gaze flickers away from Madge and Takanath, to V'lano. Affecting a migraine, massaging her temples, Fadra glances at Bali, who has barely made it back, to say, ""Would you /please/ take them away? I nay think I can do it safely, right now.""

Balinne face is, once more, in shock. But, it only lasts a moment before, as with Tzivya, she's moving before Fadra can, this time towards Madge. When she gets there, she pauses to look down at the brown, and then the new weyrling. ""This way,"" she says tightly, turning on her heels to lead the pair away. There is little, or no, expression discernable.

Illatus glances over at Amira, ""I'd have thought impressing at the end would be better, then you know who you're going into weyrlinghood with."" He sighs and watches the brown and green as the move about the sands. A look of shock crosses his face at the choice of the brown, before says, ""Congrats, Madge and Takavath,"" with no hint of insincerity.

Tannim stands near motionless lost in his own world of the eggs and hatchlings now. He watches as the brown snarls, he himself, for some reason unfazed by him. His eyes follow him as he suddenly changes directions returning back towards him and past to Madge. He jumps this time out of the way more than anything. ""Congrats Madge.""

Madge can only look up at Balinne, desperate, and follow.

Niklo seems to have caught on that the young brown in one to watch, for her gaze keeps flicking back to him and just happen to be on him when he picks his lifemate. ""Madge?"" the girl repeats the name, blinking. ""Oh. Well, congrats!"" she cheers, despite not having met the other candidate before.

<b>In the Spotlight Egg tips. It's a thoughtful little move, as if the egg is just considering this whole hatching business that has taken its siblings by storm. For a moment it seems that's the only move this dark egg will make. But then the rocking starts - a heavy sway that shifts its base in the sand and sends fissures and canyons running through the darkness to converge at the white-lit apex.</b>

Madge walks down to the far end of the Cavern.
Madge has left.

Takavath walks down to the far end of the Cavern.
Takavath has left.

Fadra , bored and no longer amused, flutters away to find something that will better hold his attentions.

Kaelana agree's, replying with a frown, ""I think the hatchlings run around for a while to put us on edge, wouldn't you think?"" She gives a small laugh, eyes still surveying the impressee's going about.

Tolemic's eyes remain on the brown despite his earlier words to Madge. When he Impresses, Mic laughs a short, breathy laugh. ""Nice brown,"" he calls after the ex-Guard. ""She's going to have her hands full, I bet,"" he adds more quietly to Niklo.

Fadra is not bored, for the record. And is still standing there, massaging her temples, watching.

<b>Lively Alpine Meadow Green hops along on a cheerful path toward those white-robed figures. Not wanting to be late for mealtime, she holds her head up high, taking confident action before she loses her nerve. Her long youthful limbs tangle in one another as she trips. For a moment, her balance is unsteady and she flails, snow-capped sage wingsails held aloft, and in the next moment, she's having her very first meal: a tongue coated in sand.</b>

Amira nods and shrugs. ""I think they do, but I know that they probably aren't. They just don't know where to look."" She warily watches the hatchlings that are searching the sands.

Illatus grins as he watches the green moving across the sands, smiling as the poor thing falls and flickering his eyes between the other eggs, lingering his gaze on those that seem to be on their way to cracking.

Nolee frowns and chews at her lip. ""You're not supposed to have favorites. It's bad for the weyr. Isn't it?"" Meanwhile, she's standing up on her tiptoes, leaning side to side, trying to see who it was. Drat, missed it. ""That girl? That other girl? Oh."" Dejected. ""One of the fighting ones?"" Sigh.

<b>The crack at the top of the Thousand Burning Lamps Egg grows wider still, glimpses of color within not badly matched to the hue of the shell itself. One last shudder and that shell breaks apart, revealing a shining new hatchling, eyes whirling, head lifted in curious enchantment.</b>

Balinne returns to her spot, her lips tight. ""I'll kill her,"" she decides, though who?
<i>
</i><div align=""center""><i><b>                             Enchanting Amber Gold                            
</b></i></div><i><b>Part dazzling fantasy, part regal dignity, one thing to be said about this queen is that she puts on quite the show. With snout down-curved and prominent, from some angles it would seem her muzzle's too strong, but the bold features of the rest of her face would be unbalanced otherwise. Dark, heavy browridges arch imperial over ingenue eyes; pale blond headknobs sweep back toward a long and sinuous neck. Resplendent in clearest, pure amber gold, her hide varies most in its reflection of light, glossy over the haunches and back and matte in the shadows of underbelly and paws. She wears her wings like a luxuriant coat, spars arched and long, translucent sails finely stroked with varying shades of umbers and ochres like a feline's fur. Though slight of frame she possesses a grace of movement and musculature, sinewy and slender, not a pound of excess.</b></i>

Tannim recovers from moments earlier edging closer now to Niklo as he feels all alone. He shudders as the poor green falls muzzle first into the sands, ""Eww I bet that doesn't taste all that good."" He says to no one in particular, maybe to the green?""

Kaelana hmms at the gold, ""So Niklo was right on that one, good call I say."" She gives a small titter at Amira's comment, ""When you impress, you should ask your dragon and tell me! I'd be interested to know.""

Tolemic bounces up onto his toes once more, craning his neck at the steadily-diminishing number of eggs and hatchlings. ""Where's that green going? Are the eggs all hatched ye... Oh hey, a gold!"" For no readily apparent reason his attention swivels up to the galleries again, wide grin on his face.

Illatus ohs as the gold appears out of her eggs, he watches her a moment, echanted by the movement and looking over at Niklo, ""That was your other bet?"" he asks before looking back to the green lumbering around. No sense in him watching a gold, is there?

Brighid, contrary to her actions toward the savage brown that just impressed to the former guard, takes a half a step toward the fallen green before catching herself and stepping back into her little depression. Her attention is caught by the sudden hatching of a shinning beauty, her eyes wide at the golden hatchling's appearance, ""Oh...""

Niklo bobs her head in agreement to Tolemic's words, grinning at the older candidate. ""Better her than me!"" she replies, making a face. ""Even if he has a real nice name."" When Tannim moves closer she reaches out to brush his arm comfortingly, and then-- ""Gold! A gold! I was right!"" The girl bounces in place, cheering. ""Only one week's chores!""

""I misspoke, then,"" murmurs V'lano with a careless wave of one hand, dismissive. ""Not a favorite. A hunch."" Just then he realizes the golden egg's split is yielding its somewhat predictable payload, and at this he smirks a little, with an approving nod of his head, else silent on the matter. ""Yes, one of the fighting ones. But not one of your candidates - if I mark my bet right, Madge hasn't been in candidacy long. I saw her a seven and some ago - and she was supposed to be dry for the time after that."" Brows twitch, but he just puts up a hand on Volath's haunch and leans, eyes thoughtfully merry.

<b>Lively Alpine Meadow Green is undaunted by this setback, and handles it with grace by licking herself down the haunch, spreading the sand. There, soothed the itchy spot, really! She next dips her head, investigating an abandoned bit of eggshell. Gathering her courage, she creels encouragingly to herself, and stands upright, wobbling. The eggshell bit is now stuck on her head, framing her face like a wimple as she blithely returns to her quest.</b>

""I am a bad person,"" Fadra confirms for herself. ""There's nay /any/ way this could get worse.""

Amira gasps, loud. A gold? She takes a step back from the new hatchling. ""If I Impress. And if you do, then you can askand tell me. Maybe you'll get her."" She points at the gold, grinning.

Tannim looks to Niklo whom he is now standing next to and smiles, ""Oh a gold! You called that one huh?"" He grins then leans away as she starts to bounce all over the place. ""careful you may just have all the hatchlings jumping on us.""

Balinne shares a look with Fadra, and shakes her head. ""You're not bad.. but you're probably in trouble."" She doesn't even grin at that. Her arms fold over her chest, and she appears content to remain that way for the rest of the Hatching. Not even the Gold gets her to smile.

Illatus smiles at the green hatchling, ""Definately confident,"" he says, glancing at his fellow candidates and shuffling his feet. His eyes flicker between the other eggs, for a moment linger on the gold, and then return to the Meadow Green.
<b>
The last crack of the Spotlight Egg breaks it in half, black curtains splitting up the middle and shattering the pale cap into so much shining dust. What is left, sitting between the two broad curves of shell, is a green hatchling still tucked into a ball as if she doesn't yet realize the constricting walls are gone.</b>

<div align=""center""><b>                         Beguiling Sunlit Satin Green                         
</b></div><b>This shapely green wears the two-tone glow of dark satin and warm sunlight with all the sensuality of a negligee, as though she revels in the feel of her own hide. A gleaming yellow spreads here and there about her healthy form, that light radiating from the curve of her jaw, flickering along her feminine shoulder, accentuating the round line of her haunches and lending definition to her already curvaceous build. Her limbs are delicate, with small and slender daintiness to her paws and the translucent webbing of her wings. Filtered hues of sunlight and verdant boudoir chiffon are strewn across her wingsails like a flimsy peignoir held by her fine spars. Her headknobs and neat little neckridges have a certain sparkle - a tiara unwound to trace down her spine. That soft flicker of silken light gathers around the base of each elevation along her slender neck and offsets their dark green glint. Her faceted eyes have heavy lids and arced ridges, tingeing her draconic expression with a languid ease.</b>

.
Ista's Weyrlingmaster looks less amazed than everyone else, at the hatching of the gold. Her face betrays distress, and she stalks away from where she's taken up post, closer to V'lano. ""/You/ did this on purpose!"" Her accusation is dark. ""You /knew/ this was going t'happen. I nay know /how/ but you /did.""

Balinne stares at Fadra, eyes wide. ""She's gone mad,"" she says to the air. Her attention goes back to the Hatching - /someone/'s gotta look out for the weyrlings.

Tolemic turns back, his eyes going straight to the Alpine green and missing the hatching of the newest green. ""Huh. Bet she's going to rethink eating that sand later. Wonder if she even knows she's not supposed to be eating it?""

Kaelana sighs, seeming to have had -this- conversation more then once, ""Let's just enjoy this momentous occasion and -not- worry about me. I daresay they are more worthy candidates for your sympathies."" About the hubbub, she mutters, ""People seem to have a thing with shiny things.""

Nolee just stares at the Weyrleader; he always speaks in riddles, and her puzzlement is clear. Brushing candidates? Dry candidates? ""I don't recognize her,"" Nolee admits quietly. ""But I hope she's bathed recently at least. With water. Wet water."" The hatching of the gold goes unnoticed as she watches the still form of the latest green. ""Get up,"" she urges. ""C'mon, up."" Then she's half-hiding behind Volath, watching the ire of Fadra with fascination.

Tannim watches the gold then notes as spotlight egg breaks open to reveal another green. He nudges Niklo and smiles, ""Oh look another green, have any bets on that one?""

Niklo just bobs her head cheerfully. ""I guessed it, yup!"" she confirms proudly, as though she hadn't been wrong on her first guess. A slight smirk, but she stops bouncing, instead going back to watching the dragonets more carefully. ""So many greens,"" the girl comments softly, ""I guess I could get lucky, eh?""

V'lano, distracted from his conversation with Nolee to receive Fadra's frustration, replies with smirky grin and a tip of a nod, as though he accepts - admits - her accusations. ""I allowed her,"" he murmurs. ""And I knew this would happen, too."" He casts another little fling of a hand out to gesture at the sands at large, encompassing. It's distant and arcane knowledge, kept for only the most adept of weyrleaders to know - but when there are eggs, often there tend to be weyrlings, in time."" His tongue parts his lips swiftly, then he glances back at Nolee, hiding in Volath's shadow: ""She won't bite. Not with me watching.""
<b>
<i>Enchanting Amber Gold picks careful, prancing steps away from the ruined remnants of her glorious shell. Petite paws splay wide over the hot sand, a study in contrast, gold on black. She makes it only a few meters from her birthplace before realizing the wonder arranged before her: so many people, both those robed in white near enough to focus whirlingly on, and those higher and farther up in the stands. All these she regards in a sweep of her head, chin up in careful consideration.</i></b>

Amira sighs and shrugs. ""It might also be that they're more rare than any other color. Though people do like shiny things."" She shrugs, watching all of the active hatchlings.

Illatus eyes the next green to emerge on to the sands, ""Well, there's certainly a lot of greens,"" he comment, looking back at the one that is away from her egg. His feet shuffle at the heat leaking through his sandals.

Nolee folds her arms and stares bovinishly at Fadra, not liking this all that much. ""You do know she's--well, she got in a fight with one of them, right? I heard all about it."" Apparently, only half about it.

<b>With a few more impish, precise steps the Lively Alpine Meadow Green prances up to one last candidate for her consideration. Delight warms the eggshell-starved red that swirls in her eyes, and with a careless little flutter of her wings she steps one more pace forward, putting herself in inviting reach of a tall, brown-haired girl. There. All taken care of.</b>

Kaelana just has to ask Amira, a near whisper, ""Do you think people would be offended if I put my hand over my face like so-"" She lifts a hand up over her eyes, ""- and yelled 'Ah, my eyes! The shinyness hurts'?"" She gives a little laugh, though how much of the comment was in jest she's not saying.

""I know,"" V'lano remarks, only, in a droll, low rumble.

Brighid tears her gaze away from the young gold and back to the greens, ""No, Brighid. She'll pick someone else. Don't think about her..."" Only those nearest might be able to hear her muttered words as she shifts again. A look of determination on her face.

<b>Tulle on the Twirl Egg has spent a whole lot of time doing absolutely nothing. Now, all at once, it makes a sickening sound, and a canyon of a crack appears. First a snout, then a pair of paws, all cornflower blue, stick through the crack, pushing and shoving and twisting until, in a tangle of limbs, the blue within is released and lays flat on his belly in the sand, looking indignant at his ungraceful arrival in the world. To his feet in a second, not to be caught on his belly long, the blue begins pacing around, embarrassed, before suddenly some /tug/ gets his attention and he hurries away from his cracked shell to boldly enter the mass of candidates. He skids to a halt in front of a tiny boy with blonde hair, cocking his head at him before nudging him demandingly. ""C'tram? Erm...Prelth? Ohhhh..."" It all dawns on him at once. ""Oh, of course you're hungry...we'll, um...we'll get you some food. Right now.""</b>

Amira suddenly freezes and starts to sway on the spot. Finally her eyes lock on the Lively Alpine Meadow Green and she falls to her knees before her, whispering something. She gently strokes the greens eyeridges and repeats what she wispered at the level of a shout. ""Myrienth!""

Balinne has relaxed a little.. maybe. Enough that she's smiling when she approaches Amira and her green. ""Congradulations, sweety,"" she says with a smile. ""Come, this way and we'll get her fed. Mind her steps.""
Amira looks up at Balinne. ""Food? Oh, right."" She stands and follows Balinne, watching her green- her green- follow.

Fadra deadpans at being mocked. ""Y'know well 'tis nay what I meant."" She points, now, accusingly, at Volath. ""/He/ told ya. Ugh."" Shaking her head, until the dark spikes that are her hair wiggle her consternation as well. And being so distracted in her wrath at V'lano, and Volath, even, the Weyrlingmaster misses Amira, leaving her staff to pick up the slack At least /someone/ is paying attention. Thank Faranth for Balinne. Fadra even has the grace to look mildly embarassed when Bali steps forward, and so she steams from near the Weyrleader, arms crossed and gaze hooded as she watches the progress of that Gold.

Tannim casts a sideways glance towards kaleana as she puts hand in front of her face, not sure exactly what she is doing. As he is watching he sees one of the greens come up to Amira and he smiles as she confirms his name. ""Oh Amira, she is lovely."" His eyes return once more to the other green as a blue appears and quickly impresses.

Illatus looks at the Meadow Green chooses her lifemate, the cheers, ""Way to go, Amira. Myrienth, you've got a good one there!"" He says, looking to the dragon before his eyes move back out onto the sands, a cheer errupting for C'tram and Prelth as well.

Amira walks down to the far end of the Cavern.
Amira has left.

Myrianth croons to her new partner, encouragingly, then flapflaps along after her toward the promise of food.
Myrianth walks down to the far end of the Cavern.
Myrianth has left.

<b>Beguiling Sunlit Satin Green blinks a faceted eye open and only after she's had a look around does she begin to uncurl from her egg-shaped position: a leg straightens, a wing stretches, her tail uncoils from around her side. She's slow about it, deliberate, batting her heavy-lidded eyes around the cavern, taking it all in as she finally rights herself and stands up on her unsteady legs.</b>

Tolemic leans over to confide to Niklo, ""Course you can get lucky. I'm safe, though - no bronzes. I -told- Seliene I'd be back at the docks. You and your dragon can come visit me, 'kay?""

Niklo overhears Kaelana and raises an eyebrow. ""Mmhmm..."" she mumbles to herself, turning when she hears more calls of congratulations. ""Oh, Amira!"" Recognition, and a cheer. ""Green! That's great!"" At Tolemic's comment the young candidate laughs. ""Still eggs out there. Who knows?"" A smirk. ""Y'might get green, an' I'll be left!""

""He did not,"" remarks V'lano, with a fond glance up at the bronze whose attention is now cruelly divided between his daughters golden and green out on the sands. ""What trouble is it to you, Weyrlingmaster? Whomever she's with will need to learn all the same things you teach any other, well - most of them, and then some. You wouldn't have wanted an incomplete experience, I'm sure?"" Poke, poke, poke.
<i>
<b>Enchanting Amber Gold inclines her chin once, turning her head a little aside as though sharing some splendid secret with the watching crowd. Now prepared, she sets out toward what remains of the semicircle of candidates, eyelids slowly shuttering and re-revealing her deep, thoughtful gaze in a series of comely blinks. Coming up short on a first investigation she doubles back for another, pacing fitfully along the line of white robes, glancing at a short pudgy girl from Keroon here, a taller one there. Only glances - nothing more.</b></i>

Kaelana looks put out at her companion having left as if the green impressing was Amira's fault. She lets out a hmph, but still calls out a congratulations to the other girl.

Illatus grins over at Tolemic, ""You're mighty confident of yourself, expecting a bronze,"" he says, chuckling before returning his eyes to the Satin Green. ""Well, she's a slow one.""

Nolee continues to hide out behind the clutchsire, curious about what's happening between V'lano and the Weyrlingmaster. ""You can't fight here,"" she hiss-whispers. ""People can -see- you!""

<b>Discarded Bubblegum Egg has, discreetly, been gathering quite the collection of cracks. And now, amongst the chaos of its siblings hatching, it feels the distinct need to do the same. It neatly falls apart, spilling a moist and creeling green onto the sand, where her smooth, bright hide becomes positively plastered. Dragging herself to her feet, the doll-like hatchling wanders, crying, directly to a young girl from Telgar Hold, hiding her head pathetically in the crook of her chosen's arm. The young woman looks stunned, her mouth becoming a small 'o' as she stares at the dragon in front of her before she assures, somewhat shakily, brushing sand away from her lifemate's hide with unshaky hands, ""Etteth, you look fine.""</b>

Tolemic says complacently, ""Nothing wrong with greens."" Which reminds him... ""Hey, who'd she look to? Amira? And has that gold done anything?"" He looks for her, only to have blue eyes caught by the shameless dark green. Lips purse in a soundless whistle, and he misses Etteth's Impression.

Tannim turns to Tolemic and nods at Illatus's comment, ""Nothing wrong with being confident now."" He looks as another green emerges and finds herself a lifemate. Very few eggs left he thinks to himself looking out over the remaining candidates still standing on the sands.

<b>Beguiling Sunlit Satin Green leaves the goo and shatters of shell behind her, though they follow the trail of her tail in a sticky line. To feel the eyes of the cavern on her makes her tuck her head to the side, coy and shy, and yet she doesn't hesitate as she heads towards the mass of white robed candidates. She cants her head at one, drops her chin at another and draws away from both and keeps searching.</b>

""We aren't fighting."" V'lano turns a blind side to Fadra to tell Nolee this through a grin.

Volath, for his part, bends his muzzle down and fixes a gaze on Nolee with one whirling, curious eye - not for long, though. She's permitted her hiding, so that the bronze can keep his attention on the sands.

Niklo grins, nodding at Tolemic and Illatus. ""Nothin' wrong with green a'tall!"" she agrees, then shrugs, looking around. ""An' the gold... she seems t'be jus' wanderin' around. Like most of 'em."" Sage nod. ""Still there, though. See?"" The girl guestures in the general direction of the young queen.

Illatus smiles at Tannim and nods, ""Certainly not, but a bronze is not better than any other colour,"" he says to his fellow, looking at the Satin Green. ""Take her for instance, certainly confidant, very pretty."" He shrugs, ""All the dragons seem pretty... must get it from the mother? Or father?"" He shrugs.

<i><b>The Enchanting Amber Gold makes one more approach, regarding again the white-robed offerings provided for her selection. Her eyes whirl slowly, hunger plain in their rich burgundy hue, but she keeps calm: this one thing must be done first, above all else. One last glance-over and her head goes down at last, neck arching low to express obeisance and love for just one green-eyed, honey-skinned girl.</b></i>

<b><i>A breeze wafts over your skin, but it is not the stagnant, oppressive air of the hatching cavern. No, this is a different feel, like the sweet breath of a buoyant day from a high precipice with all the world stretching below. The sand beneath your feet seems to sink away, draining from your awareness along with the rest of the cavern. Fabric rustles, light, smooth curtains that blow in that enchanted wind and obscure your vision, your senses. Silks and satins, fine linens of vibrant, festive colors, move around you, enveloping you, taking you away. &lt;&lt; Niklo, &gt;&gt; A voice so rich and melodious that it sings your name. &lt;&lt; I am Eviath. &gt;&gt; Those drapes of color part and the cavern comes back into focus as love rises in your chest. &lt;&lt; I am yours and you are mine. Together. &gt;&gt;</i></b>

Balinne walks down to the far end of the Cavern.
Balinne has left.

In the Pit Egg strains, pulls, and whistles until finally the shell has had enough. With a trumpets blare, In the Pit Egg shatteres, spilling a bewildered young blue onto the sands. With a frightened chirrup, he scrambles to his feet, wings and tail going wild. In a tripping rush, he takes a leap forwards and lands nearly atop a frightened boy from Harper Hall. The squeal of surprise is quickly turned into a squeal of delight as the young boy leans down to help up his lifemate. ""His name is Berth!""

<i>Niklo's flopping hand freezes, then drops to her side and she tips her head, blinking. ""W-what?"" the candidate says aloud, staring at the young dragon that seems to have chosen her. ""I... oh, Eviath."" A smile begins, small but growing quickly, ""Together. Yeah... I like that. A lot.""</i>

Tolemic throws his head back and all but crows, ""Niklo! Told you you and your dragon'd get to come visit me down at the docks! Eviath's /lovely/, Nik. She suits you."" The other green, the blue, the last of the eggs, are all nigh-forgotten as the last of his neighbors Impresses right beside him.

Tannim nods to Illatus in agreement, ""No of course not and they are all lovely, or handsome as the case may be."" he turns his attention then back to the gold and green, watching as the gold walks over to Niklo arching her neck towards her. ""Oh my! Niklo Congratulations, you got the gold!"" he starts to shake again now as another blue impresses leaving, how many eggs?

Fadra holds her breath - and then barks a laugh. She can't help it, and whatever anger she had for V'lano is disappated when the gold picks her lifemate. If only to get away from the clutchsire and his /dispicable/ rider, Fadra reaches into her pocket to wander closer to the newest goldpair. ""Niklo,"" she says, ""and Eviath. Follow me, then."" And she's striking a path in the direction the other weyrlings went.

Illatus's eyes move to the gold, when the gold stops moving, and then up to her chosen lifemate. ""Niklo?"" he mutters, questioning it himself, before exclaiming a louder, ""Niklo! Way to go!"" Clapping his hands.

<b>The Beguiling Sunlit Satin Green spots the one. The one for her. It is an obvious relief for one who was so stranded, so adrift in the world all alone. She sighs a heavy breath as if she could not have stood to be alone for one moment longer. It lifts her head with rapture and her body goes soft towards the man with short dark curls.</b>

V'lano laughs, turning around as Fadra leaves him in this strange defeat. ""Oh, fantastic,"" rumbles the weyrleader then, stepping over to Nolee's hiding spot - it's not like she's well-hidden - to watch the rest of the hatching from there. ""What do you think of her,"" asks V'lano sidelong, of Nolee presumably, ""Weyrwoman?""

Brighid's breath catches as Niklo impresses to the little queen, ""Oh, Niklo! Congratulations."" She almost sounds like she's going to cry now that the gold is no longer hunting and forces herself to focus on the remaining hatchlings and few eggs.

Niklo looks on the verge of tears, but she manages not to cry -- just yet. ""C'mon, Eviath,"" she says quietly, not quite trusting her voice, ""Let's getcha somethin' to eat, eh?"" Reaching out to brush her fingertips against her new lifemate's golden neck, she slowly moves off to follow Fadra.

You walk down the stairs, emerging into a corridor only lit by evenly spaced glowbaskets. As you walk down the corridor, one thing noticible is that there are no branching corridors off this corridor. You emerge on the Hatching Sands. There is no turning back now.

<b>Hatching Sands(#1296RJqs$)
This huge cavern arcs high overhead, a volcanic bubble in matte black rock left open to the wide sky at the top. The black sand of the Istan hatching grounds reflects less light than a paler sand would; as a result the cavern is darker than most, particularly when the sun's not directly overhead. Tunnels lead off to the bowl and the queens' quarters to southeast and southwest. Tiers of galleries provide seating for spectators, while ledges above offer perches for dragons.

Besides the span of the galleries to the south, one can head over towards the entrance to the hatching grounds, or into one of the Queen's tunnels to the southeast and southwest.

The people here on the dark sands are Illatus, Nolee, Tannim, Kaelana, Tolemic, Amira, Madge, Kamia, K'ylon, Balinne, Griere, V'lano, and Tzivya. Dragons here include Aerianth, and Volath.  
Sandy Mound, and Glowbasket are lying around loose on the dark sand.
Obvious exits:
Dragon Ledges  Main Entrance  </b>

Fadra comes out of a yawning tunnel onto the Hatching Sands.
Fadra has arrived.

The candidates shift uneasily on the hot sands, eventually being herded into a loose semi-circle around the eggs. Nolee waves her arms around, leading them in a quick respectful bow to the clutchparents before the blonde scoots over to the edge of the sands.

Volath's eyes whirl a little speedily and he angles his snout around his mate to get a glimpse of the doorway through which he's accustomed to the white-robed humans appearing. His eggs are shaking: Where are the candidates? Their arrival earns from him a long, pleasant whuff of satisfaction, after which he draws new breath for more humming.

""There we are,"" V'lano says, more simply, watching his weyrmate with the mother queen.

Aerianth flutters her wingtips, hardly a small motion for such large pinions. Her hum grows stronger, excited to see the herd of candidates arrive, watching them without the usual wary reservation.

Balinne tip-toes her way on to the Sands, looking a little sweaty. She finds a comfortable spot near the Weyrleaders, and turns a wary eye towards the clutch. ""Just be ready to grab 'em when they Impress,"" she mutters to K'ylon. She scans the arriving candidates, smiling for a few, shaking her head for another, and then nearly doubles over. ""Madge?"" she all but yelps, her face suddenly expressionless.

K'ylon nods solemnly to Balinne, ""Aye."" He, too, scans the faces of the gathered candidates. ""Wonder which will be ours.""

""Oh, you nay knew either?"" Fadra says dryly as she moves closer to Balinne and K'ylon, taking up post there and crossing her arms. ""Well, at least I know 'twas nay some underhanded trick. Aye, that's Madge. I nay know where she got permission, but there she is. Splendid.""

<b>Overstuffed Wardrobe Egg quivers, its lumpen surface expanding in rhythmic contractions. A sudden crack along one edge of its sandy-brown patch, and then a tail-tip shoves through with brute force, quickly followed by two short forelegs on the opposite side. Out splays the compact, well-muscled form of an ochre-toned brown. Red eyes whirl speedily as he claims his feet, which then conduct him along with surprising steadiness as he immediately makes his rounds of the white-robed candidates. The brown seems to stare fixedly into many of the candidate's faces, and one very foolish, very daring teen steps out of the semi-circle, and promptly gets trampled as the brown rushes over him, in favor of the short, shy young girl hiding just behind him. Ista's off to a running start with young Pressa calling out, ""Um... Dorsoth's hungry!""</b>

Balinne grits her teeth, still a little hard to read, expression wise. ""Oh, I have a sneaking suspicion I know who."" But then she's quiet, just watching.

""Then she must have managed the whole sevenday,"" remarks V'lano, casting a sidelong glance at the weyrling team, one brow arched and quirking twitchingly. ""Dry. May I assume as much?""

Tolemic gasps a bit as the heat hits in a wave. ""Shells!"" The halt in momentum is only temporary, for he winces, lifting his feet up higher, and moves over to join Niklo. ""That was fast - Niklo, d'd you see that brown?""

Illatus steps onto the sands with the other candidates and follows the bow of the junior queen riders, then moves along with his fellows to stand around the cluster of eggs, his face grimacing at the heat of the sands. He looks rather pale, quite understandable in the situation really. He's shocked at the speed of the first impression, barely blinking as the girl impressed to a brown. He glances to his friends. ""Wow.""

Kamia shifts on the sand, startled, eyes wide as she watches the first impression, the scariness of it all starting to finally sink in.

Amira sidles along the semi-circle toward Kaelana. Her breathing is shallow and her face is pale as she keeps her eyes on the eggs that will decide her fate. ""It seems like there's so many more from down here,"" she says nervously to Kaelana, wringing her hands.

Fadra's fine dark eyebrow arches at V'lano, even as she gestures B'ryce away to collect thier first weyrling. ""She'll be dry a fine time longer'n a sevenday, if'n she comes out o'this with a dragon,"" Fadra says. ""I hope someone warned her.""

Nolee claps her hands together as the first dragonet emerges and claims a lifemate right away. ""Jays!"" she hollers. ""Remember to watch out, beware, mind the claws, all of those things and--oh dear. Healers already? Is that trampled one all right?""

Niklo wanders out between Tolemic and Tzivya, as if surrounding herself with older candidates for security. Or something. But at all the excitement she just shrugs. ""Yeah,"" she grins slightly at Mic, ""'Nother hatchin', more babies.""

Tannim starts to shift from foot to foot almost immediately, his eyes go wide as the brown breaks from his prison egg and quickly finds his lifemate. He smiles at Kamia, ""Are the all that fast?""

Madge is a new development and she certainly looks the part. Tugging on the hem of her robe and shifting in sandals that don't fit as well as they could, she casts wary, nervous glances this way and that and stands apart from the other candidates. Should anyone give her any looks and she catches it? She'll be giving them very /what/? looks in return.

K'ylon is uncertain what Balinne and Fadra and V'lano speak of. Instead, his attention wanders to more familiar faces on the sands. He's doing a little skip-hop himself. Nervous.

Tzivya gives Fadra another cold look, though it briefly turns sad before she turns away and moves with the candidates. She settles into the semi-circle, and smile to the first Weyrling pair. She settles in next to Niklo, grinning to her friend. ""No, some take a lot longer. It all depends, y'know?"" She glances to Madge. ""Madge!"" She calls to her. ""Come stand with us, hey?""

V'lano, attending mostly to Fadra's words, does nothing more than lift a slender, tanned hand to shield the side of his face, as if by so doing he might deny the Istan tradition - or whatever it is that causes candidates to get bloodied on these sands. ""I warned her,"" he notes, droll.

<b>Red Velvet Swag Egg shudders once, and then a series of brief, but intense heaves shake the ovoid, as it refuses to be silenced. Back and forth along its long axis it rocks, disturbing the fine, black Istan Sands it's mounded upon. A sudden pitch sends it careening over the lip of its home, reeling and spinning like a drunken sailor, until gravity brings it to rest far from where it once sat. A teeter-totter game ensues, this time rolling the egg along its shorter sides. And then, with a giant shudder, it comes to rest...a hairline crack tearing a jagged line across stately, scarlet draperies.</b>

Tolemic boucnes a little on his tows, sweat flying already as he shakes out his hands and arms. ""These are sure different from down here than up there, huh?"" he asks Nik, nodding toward the Stands. As if cued, he stops paying attention to the eggs and even the hot sands to scan the galleries.

Kaelana gives a faint wince from the heat of the sands, fitting in near the edge of the semi circle. The comment from Amira gets a twist of her heard and a hike of her robe, as she replies, ""Not to worried about that, thoguh they could've at least made it a bit cooler in here."" She gives the sands a small kick, wincing as some lodges in under her sandel.

Balinne is trying very hard not to bore holes into Madge's skull - can she feel the heat? ""At least it's going quickly,"" she mutteres towards K'ylon, her own feet still.
.
Kamia shakes her head up at Tannim, shaking a bit now. ""No, not all of them will..."" She mentions timidly, her eyes darting to Tzivya's egg to see what happens.

Illatus looks over at Madge, slightly shocked to see her there before his attention turns back to the eggs. He shuffles his feet in the heat, then looks over towards Niklo, the only other candidate near his own age. ""You allright, Nik?"" he asks quietly of her, before quickly looking back to the eggs.

Fadra looks positively thrilled. ""And we're starting off well, too. Lookit that, healers already."" Something suggests that maybe it's not /all/ sarcasm in Fadra's voice, but she crosses her arms and considers the goings on. ""Though, I imagine we can find her smashed later this eve, if'n she /doesn't/ end up with a dragon. Who knows.""

Niklo gives in a little there, nodding. ""Yeah..."" she says at last, ""Guess it is pretty different, eh?"" The young candidate bites her lip at Illatus's question, takes a deep (and perhaps a little shuddery) breath, then nods. ""Yeah."" Pause. ""Yeah! I'm fine."" A grin.

<b>From the Rafters Egg gives a little wiggle, barely enough to get noticed. Did it move? Maybe it was just a shadow, for now it remains perfectly still upon the dark Istan sands.</b>

Madge's reaction to Tzivya's beckoning is met with hesitance. Er. But, after weighing the odds and having seen a bit of a trampling already she decides the odds are in her favor the more people she has around her. So, with little sidesteps that mince and skip she shuffles over to the other candidates and balls her hands around her robe. A grunt of a greeting is all they get.

Amira nods, shuffling her feet because of the heat and nervousness. She keeps her hands clasped together to keep their shaking down. Her eyes dart quickly over each egg that moves.

K'ylon murmurs to Fadra, ""Aye, and it's a normal enough reaction."" Still he guesses something else is at play, and sets to watching this unexpected candidate just a little bit harder.

Tannim smiles the newly arrived candidate not having seen her before. he gives a varied look towards Tzivya but his attention is soon caught back up in the eggs and all that is going on before him. One noticible change though from when he walked is is he is no longer shaking.

""Well, would you have done any better?"" V'lano arches the other brow at Fadra now, which makes the twitching constitute waggling, and after a last long glance of his dark merry eyes he crosses his arms and turns to the scene, attentive to hatchlings and candidates.

<b>Stage Fright Egg lies in quietly, barely giving the occasional tremble. It draws worried looks from many, and speculation that it will not hatch successfully. And then those apprehensions are allayed as, without fanfare, the shell pops and out flows the form of an ultramarine blue, like a seamonster emerging from the waves. Forward he moves, towards those white robes, his movements hypnotic, graceful. Unlike some of his brethren, this particular hatchling seems to know early on who will fit him perfectly - and exactly where they are. A soft snort, and he nearly scampers up to a rail-thin, tall young woman who wears sorrow on her face like a mask. A sudden gasp from her, and she falls to her knees, tears trailing off her chin, spattering onto the upturned muzzle of her lifemate.</b>

Illatus smiles and nods to Niklo, but keeping his attention on the eggs. He lifts his eyes for a moment to glance over the galleries, searching for any familiar face, before lowering his eyes back to the eggs with a slightly dissapointed expression and catching the impression of a blue, clapping and shouting his congratulations.

Tzivya gives Niklo's hand a squeeze and the girl a shaky grin. ""Not so bad, see? Can barely tell there's a thousand people watching our every move!"" She looks to the girl on her other side. ""Not met you properly. I'm Tzivya, Balinne's niece!""

Tolemic leaves off studying the stands to look sidelong at Madge. ""Hey,"" he offers with more than a touch of confusion when she joins them. Then a flash of blue catches his attention, but by the time he's whipped around to look, Impression's already taken place.

Kamia starts to get even more nervous now that none of her closer friends have impressed, and she looks at the other Candidates worriedly, 2 eggs down... only so many more to go.

Nolee watches the Stage fright egg, her hands up over her mouth as she stares, sighing relief as the shell breaks open. ""Oooh, that one's very pretty. That's right,"" she helps, pointing wildly at the pair to follow a member of the Weyrlingmaster's team off the sands. ""Food's that-a-way.""

<b>Rocking heavily, the striated curves of the Red Velvet Swag Egg heave and ripple, much as its dam's belly once did in laying it. One fissure, then two, spread longitudinally over its surface, quickly webbing into an intricate maze along its western face. As more cracks force their way deeply through the shell, a goo-encased head shoves partially outward, punching viscerally against its confinement, seeking to win free. And suddenly, there is an explosion of shards that litter the black sands with memories of a none-too-comfy prison - and in their wake, a long, tall wilderness of green hatchling struggles to her feet, tossing back her wobbling, shell-crowned head, and giving a stuttered trumpet to announce her arrival.</b>

<div align=""center""><b>                             Stately Forest Green                             
</b></div><b>A variety of forest hues drench the bright hide of this tall, long hatchling, a progression of verdancy from new leaves to rich viridian to darkest olive green. Her legs are strong but subtly so, tipped with darker paws and dangerous, sturdy talons. Possessed of a taut, streamlined body, ready muscles in her haunches and back hint at strength not entirely evident in her generally sleek shape. A lithe and frisky tail balances perfectly a willowy neck and sensitive muzzle, all held just so. Lofty sails of translucent pine descend from darker, thickset spars sprinkled with a dusting of fey silver. Elongated, argent headknobs, paler at their peaks, lend her head a sense of length, while lustrous and subtle eyeridges lend expression to large, intense eyes below. She holds herself with a regal poise and a controlled demeanor, all self-certainty and lightweight confidence.</b>

Balinne jumps, one hand on her heart. ""Faranth, forgot how fast it was,"" she says, spying the green straight away. There's a softer look for the dragon - biased? - and she says, ""Pretty thing, hm?"" to K'ylon, sparing in a tight-lipped grin.

Tannim is started as the egg shatters sending him jumping backwards none to noticeably. A flush comes over his face, possibly from embarrassment or maybe its from the heat of the sands. He ohhs nudging Kamia, ""Look a green.""

Niklo had been doing just fine until Tzivya decides to mention the audience. Then she seems to choke, shudder, and starts to say something... and then the Red Velvet Swag Egg hatches. ""Look!"" All nervousness is forgotten. ""Look, that's my favorite! A green, look! A green!""

Kamia oohs quietly over the green.. her eyes blinking a bit at the deep colors and her size, looking around the other Candidates, to see if she finds her match among them. ""She's a beaut...""

Kaelana looks half bored and half watchful, not stupid enough to let her disinterest get her on the end of a hatchlings claws. She glances at her friend and asks, ""Whats up with you? Nervous or something?"" She doesn't comment on the newest dragons, but is wary of them nonetheless.

K'ylon ayes softly to Balinne. ""She's a looker alright. Delicate."" His words are sparse now that there's work to be done, and impressees to take care of.

Madge glances over at Tolemic and lifts an eyebrow. ""Madge."" And then, again, for Tzivya, ""Madge."" At least she has that part down. Every crack of shell and new name called out has her twitching, then looking irritated with herself for being startled; her feet shuffle around constantly.

Illatus's eyes are drawn to the green that seems to be taking her time. ""How pretty,"" he says, glancing at the other eggs and shuffling his feet in the black sands. He glances to the candidates around him. Looking at Madge, ""Nice to hear your name,"" he says, grinning to her.

<b>From the Rafters Egg wiggles again. It's first attempts is more practice than anything, as it attempts to figure out this rocking thing. Shimmy. Shimmy-shake. But it's not quiet got it yet. Maybe a little bit more of a /rocking/ motion will work?</b>

Tzivya grins at Niklo, ""Maybe she's for you?"" She says, in a hopeful voice. She looks back to the green appraisingly. ""Though, she's got a serious look to her, probably not so good for you. Madge gets a warm smile. ""Relax, it'll be easy, hey?""

Volath rumbles a note of approval for the first green out of his clutch. Well, he would. He bends down his head a little for a better look at her silver-tipped shape, the thoughtful notes in his throat resolving soon into more egg-encouraging humming.

Tolemic nervously licks his lips and swallows, blue eyes flashing over the twitching eggs to linger on that green. After a second they flick up to Aerianth, then Volath, then again over to the stands. ""Madge,"" he repeats, sparing the attention to peek over at the new Candidate. ""I'm Mic."" Then he's back to the green and the eggs, watching them with all the skittish intent of a bovine at dragon feeding time.

Amira smiles at the green's entrance. ""Nervous? Of course I am. I've never been this nervous in my life!"" She takes a deep breath and doesn't comment on Kae's lack of a reaction to the hatching. She instead watches the green, as it might prove to be dangerous.

<b>Script Egg isn't moving; its probably rather impossible, really, with the way it's been more than half-buried, with both apexes concealed beneath small mounds of sand. To compensate, however, it's tapping. Tap. Taptaptap. Excuse me? Is anyone out there?</b>

Kamia tilts her head confused. ""Why hasn't she found her match yet?"" She looks over to Tannim worriedly, an looks at the other eggs, then the green dragon again.

Illatus looks over at the tapping eggs and frowns in concern, before turning his eyes back to the green admiringly. He glances at Kamia, ""She's taking her time, knows what she wants,"" he says, smiling and looking back to the young dragonnet.

Balinne spares a moment to wipe at sweat on her forhead. ""Forgot how hot it was,"" she notes, rolling her eyes. ""You OK?"" The question is posed to K'ylon, and she gives him a curious look. ""Breath.""

Niklo gives Tzivya a half-nervous, half-hopeful look. ""I... I dunno,"" is her only response, eyes still fixed on the little green. As for all the introductions being made here, of all places, she just plain ignores them. Plenty of time for that later! Now there's room for only the eggs, and the dragonets emerging from them.

<b>Stately Forest Green heaves herself upright, her eggshell 'crown' spinning crazily upon one headknob, until a regal toss of her neck sends it flying. Yes, much better now! A soft, disdainful snort, and her strong, supple form gives a huge stretch, her carmine gaze taking note of the noises and things around her. And with a huff, the proud lady reorients her eyes on those white-clad, pink things some meters away, and takes her first, sure steps. And promptly spills face first into the Sands.</b>

Tannim steals a quick glance up towards the stands to see if his family made it by some off chance. He doesn't look long, not wanting to miss anything down here lest he get trampled or mauled or something. He grins at Kamia and shrugs. ""Must be picky, has to be the perfect one."" He shifts from foot to foot, sweat starting to run noticeably down his forehead.

Madge's lip curls at Illatus. ""Uh. Yeah."" Her name is good. It doesn't change or jump out at her. Tolemic gets another look, then Tzivya, and finally she nods and takes a deep breath. Oh yeah, breathing. ""Easyeasyeasyeasy."" When in doubt, stick to a mantra. When the green topples she winces. Ow.

Kamia whimpers at the poor Green, wanting so much to go help her, and so worried that she is ok. ""It's ok beauty... take it slow"" She encourages at her distance, not wanting to get in the way of the dragon's other half.
<b>
Rocking, rocking, rocking, poor In the Rafters Egg still can't seem to get the hang of this 'birth' thing. It lies still again, resting, perhaps. Just when one might suspect it had given up on life, its shell bursts with a startling *SNAP* sound, shattering into a million fragments. With a startled squawk, the Headstrong Stone-Wrought Green Dragonet is spilled out onto the dark Istan sands, breathing her first breath of life.</b>

Kaelana does look nervous on closer inspection, but it's not likely for one to take the time away from the stumbling dragonet or the shaking eggs. ""Well, hopefully your nervousness is from optimism and not... well, hopefully -your- dragon is out on these sands.""

Nolee overhears Kamia's question in the midst of shifting from foot to foot to ease the heat even at the edges of the sands. ""Some of them take a little while. Hopefully not too long. But a little while."" She looks back in time to find the dragonet flopped over, and to tilt her head, puzzled. Oops.

</div>She's like a gemstone, this robust young green, chiseled rough from the earth by willpower alone. Her deep malachite color grows darker down solid legs, nearing black at trim, blunt talons. Marbling of beryl cracks like the veins in granite down her sides, angling across her haunches and spreading throughout her broad, opaque wingsails. Her head is long, her eyes wide-set, but her muzzle is tapered, delicate and feminine. Her slender neck slopes into graceful shoulders, where sinew lends her body a potent hardiness that is softened by a shapely tail. Not as delicate as some, she's got more strength than grace in a form sculpted by well-defined muscle. She may not be the biggest green, but she promises to be powerful.</b>

K'ylon remembers to breathe -barely. A smile flits over his lips as the regal green trips. ""Remember that, Bali?"" He relaxes somewhat.

Kamia her eyes dart to the newest arrival, completely and totally feeling out of the water now, taking a few steps back to relieve her feet and get a better view.

Fadra gives a slanted look past Balinne to K'ylon, looking momentarily bemused. ""If'n y'faint on me, K'ylon,"" she warns (though maybe she's bantering?) you'll nay like where y'wake up - nor what you'll be wearing.""

Illatus looks at the green as she tumbles, and then at the newly-hatched one, smiling at the creatures. He spares another glance and Madge and frowns, ""Don't remember me, huh?"" he asks, shuffling and hopping between his feet. ""They all come at once, don't they?"" he says, to no one in particular.

Balinne snorts, but there's a curious uplift in her mouth. She's finally starting to enjoy herself again. ""I remember. Didn't think I would, but I do."" She chokes a bit of laughter at Fadra, and spares the Weyrlingmaster a look. For now, she'll pretend they're friends.

Tzivya slips her hand free of Niklo's, focusing on the eggs shattering around them. Her eyes are wide and her breathing is fast as she watches the hatchlings find their partners in life. She glances over at the weyrling staff on the sideline biefly, especially Balinne, but she can't be distracted long from the winged beasts being born.

Tannim winces as the green falls over his healer instinct wanting to go help the poor thing but better judgement prevails as his attention is shifted to the new arriving green. He winces some as sweat stings his eyes, wiping it away with the back of his hand. he motions this time to Tzivya, ""Oh another green.""
<b>
Dramatic Mask Egg gives a wiggle, gives a shake, and tumbles off its mound to roll to a halt at the base, where it cracks open and spills a distraught looking brown onto the sands. He rises, spreading out his wings for an examination that concludes with an approving grunt, before throwing himself into a hunt for something only he knows. He's woven in and out of the candidates three or four times, nary stopping to look at a one for longer than a second, when he suddenly gives a little shriek of surprise. Spinning back around, the brown catches his own long tail between his claws and comes spilling to a halt no where near anyone. It's when a tall boy from the Harper Hall steps forward and kneels next to him that the brown stops bemoaning his own injury to look contently at his chosen. ""His name is Copaeth,"" the boy tells those closest to him, ""and he says he's fine.""</b>

Amira grins at Kaelana's words if not at her as she looks out at the green- no two greens- that populate the sands so far. ""I'm nervous because of everything, I think. And maybe your dragon is out there, too."" She glances quickly at Kaelana.

Tolemic's feet shuffle on the sands, absently scooping and kicking out a little hollow. ""Watch,"" he tells himself, or perhaps just the air. A short little whistle escapes his lips at the sight of the newest green, but he's looking over at the other eggs soon enough, missing the first green's faceplant. ""Hey, that brown moved quick. They move faster'n you think, don't they?""

Madge, after looking at Illatus again and more intently this time, does remember him. ""Oh. You."" Did he expect something other than nervous recognition? Apparently she only has one mode right now, and it's anxious. Wiping her sweaty palms up and down her robe she mutters, ""Sorry. I ain't all that-"" Twitch. Another dragon.

Niklo doesn't seem to notice when her friend's hand slips from hers. Nope, she's playing it cool. Mostly. All her attention is on the young dragons wandering, and the eggs unhatched as she unconsciously shifts her weight from foot to foot on the hot sands.

<b>Script Egg has, somehow, made a space in which it can wriggle. So that's exactly what it does, in what seems to be futile attempts to dislodge itself completely. The tapping from within has lost it's rhythmic quality and yielded to a staccato beat of impatience.</b>

Illatus grins at Tolemic and nods, before quickly looking back at the dragonets moving across the sands. He smiles at Madge, grinning slighly and murmuring, ""Yeh, I guessed,"" as he watched the brown impress, ""Yay, first boy to impress,"" he says, chuckling to himself.

Kaelana lets out a strained laugh, deciding on her response. ""If K'ylon isn't a liar, then maybe you're right. I don't know enough either way to guess if he -is- right, so i'm just going to go with my gut feeling and root for those who actually deserve it."" She takes a small shuffle, the heat of the sands slowly seeping through the thin soles of her sandels.

Tannim nods agreement to Tolemic as he over hears his second comment. ""They sure do, no wonder they say be vigilant."" He sighs as he is blinded from the stinging sweat in his eyes, grumbling to no one in particular. ""They should have us wear head bands or something to stop the sweat, I can't see now.""

<b>Stately Forest Green lurches to all fours again, pinions working to pull her free from the groud. I meant to do that. Roughly snorting accumulated sand from her nostrils, she takes a moment to gather herself, then sets off once again on her adventure. Hmm, no, not that one... Nor that one. No, not even /that/ one. She seems to know what she's doing, taking her time in rejecting one Candidate after another as she strolls by with wobbly grace.</b>

Kamia relaxes as the forest green dragon seems to get her feet under her, and settles to watch the dragons again.

Illatus lets out an involutary giggle at the way the Forest Green appears to be dismissing the candidates she passes, ""Definately knows what she wants, doesn't she?"" the boy says, apparently becoming more at ease with the whole process now he's survived the first few minutes of the hatching. Something he didn't really expect to happen.

Amira nods once, in agreement. ""If you do, then you'll be rooting for yourself. You were Searched, so you deserve it."" She crosses her arms to better keep them controlled and follows the hatchlings with her eyes.

V'lano, after a moment checking on his weyrwoman to be certain she - and Aerianth - are all well, edges around to Volath's shoulder and leans there. Volath looks down at his rider for a moment, 'hm?' but receiving no feedback, goes back to watching his daughters (and his sons too, sometimes) while humming encouragement for those hatchlings still shellbound.

Nolee notices that V'lano is over yon leaning on dragon shoulder, and she slowly and carefully makes her way over to him, her eyes on the dragonets much more than the candidates. ""They're all alive!"" she comments. ""Well, so far, anyway."" Obliviously, she sighs. ""Hot day, isn't it?""
<b>
Script Egg's wiggling about has done little to help it; on the contrary, it's now deeper in the sand than when it started, and the hatchling inside seems terrified at the prospect of being buried alive, as the sand trickles back to fill in over it's shell. The egg gives a jump that could be frantic, and when it lands the shell spider webs neatly, but doesn't fall apart as such. It's a flurry of shards, most of which end up clinging to his hide.</b>
<b>
</b><div align=""center""><b>                             Shrewd Savannah Brown                            
</b></div><b>At first glance, it's hard to notice anything about this brown except for his unusual build. The outline of his full form is bold and bulky rather than long and lean, excepting the sharp feature that is his muzzle and the whiplike length of his tail. His musculature is a promise of endurance and strength, if not excessive speed, tightly wound cords that ripple beneath the sepia of his hide with movements even as miniscule as a turn of his head. He's of a dusky coloration, a burnt shade of umber that maintains a relative uniformity over his hide. In contrast to that darkness, a brighter shade of ochre brushes along his shoulders and chest, accentuating their burly strength. The same color can be seen sparingly on other parts of his frame: dominating the tip of his tail, and patches of worn suede at each joint. His girth and darkness lend him a surly confidence.</b>

Balinne murmers, ""Get ready,"" to no one in particular. She's anticipating something, but whatever it is, it's interupted with the hatching of a brown. ""oh. Well, Nevermind."" Hm. More waiting.

Kaelana raises a brow, seeming to have had this conversation before, ""I think the time to dicuss the validity of my claim would be once all the dragonets have cleared the sands, wouldn't you think?""

Tzivya glances over to Illatus, ""Taking her time finding it, though. Maybe she rattled soemthing when she fell over?"" She says, with a small laugh. Her cheer is forced though, and her humor fake. She glances up at the stands a moment, searching among the people there for familiar faces.

Madge sticks close to Tzivya, just shy of grabbing the other girl's hand. She's too proud, and possibly too paralyzed, to do so. But the closeness is appreciated, the sheer reminder that she isn't alone. Fingers flex and feet twitch and sand is sprayed from sandals and all is generally in motion.

K'ylon silent urges the hatchlings towards their lifemates, whoever they may be. And if he has favourites, he can be forgiven. At least he isn't holding his breath anymore.

""Always hot on the sands,"" V'lano replies, though after this he straightens and lifts a lazy salute to the junior weyrwoman, glancing her way once before looking out at the sands again, only to find a brown hatched in his brief distraction. ""There's another live one,"" the weyrleader observes. ""Beefy little brown. Must have had a rich egg. How did the candidates turn out for you? Everyone combed and brushed and -dressed- quickly enough for your liking?""

Amira grins. ""That's the only time it can be more than speculation for -any- of the candidates. Not just you. Oh, look another brown."" She points out the newly hatched... hatchling.

Niklo is beginning to settle into all this, hot, audience, everything. That is, until she spots the Script Egg hatch. ""Oh no!"" the youngster groans, smacking her forehead. ""A brown... I was wrong. Uncle might be right... bettin' ain't for girls."" Sigh.

Fadra tilts her head off to the side at the browns hatching, and her gaze flickers up to the ledges, where the bulk of her lifemate sits, no doubt. ""Aye, they are handsome,"" she agrees with no one, or perhaps that someone she's trying to spy, before calling to Niklo, ""Oh, Niklo? I do believe that's /one/ week o'chores.""

Illatus frowns at Tzivya, ""No, they always fall over a little, don't they?"" he asks, his eyes moving to admire the brown as he breaks shell. ""He's a little bit... out of shape, isn't he?"" the boy asks. ""Looks a little, y'know, bulky?"" Illy shrugs. He looks over at Niklo, ""Where'd you get marks to bet with?""

Tolemic rises up onto his toes, stumbling a little before he manages to catch himself again. ""S'that a brown? Whew, he's a sturdy looking one, isn't he?"" Back onto his heels he goes, craning his neck to search out the other free hatchlings. ""Has that green chosen yet?""

Tannim doesn't see the brown hatch as he is still wiping his eyes. When he finally does get them clear he sees what the other are talking about with the green but his attention moves quickly to the brown. In his shifting he inadvertently nudges madge and whispers an apology, grimacing slightly. ""Sorry bout that.""

<b>Headstrong Stone-Wrought Green sits among the remains of her egg. With a start, she jerks her head back and peers around her. Eggs. White-things. Hm. With a determined snort, she rocks herself up onto all fours, but though the motion is self-assured, her balance is not. With a startled squeak she tumbles tail-over-head and lands in much the same position she started out in, following in her sister's motions.</b>

Kaelana grins, finally letting her attention rest of the little dragons storming about, ""Maybe I'm not as bad at this candidate thing as you all give me credit for then?""

Griere seems intent on ignoring any and all conversation. Well, perhaps not -all-. Every once in a while she gives a silent little nod that suggest her queen might have her ear. While Aerianth might be pleased to have the candidates around, her lifemate's eyes are still sharp - sharp as new dragon claws on an unwary candidate, perhaps.

Tzivya looks over to Niklo, ""What'd you bet, anyway? I Haven't had much chance to catch up with you lately."" Fadra's voice reaches her and she winces. ""Oh. You bet with /her/. Well, you get what you get then, sorry hon."" She glances at Illatus. ""Did her chores, I expect. They pay pretty well, really.""

Niklo forces a weak smile at Fadra's call. ""I know... I know,"" she nods grudingly, then shoots Illatus, and Tzivya, a look. ""Naw, not marks... chores. A week's chores."" The girl bites her lip. ""If my other guess's wrong... ugh, don't wanna think 'bout it.""

Amira shakes her head quickly. ""If you mean that you have as much of a chance as anyone else, yes of course. But you didn't do to well with the rules of candidacy."" She grins at her friend.

Balinne leans over to nudge K'ylon gently. ""Brown,"" she says, and points at the most recently hatched one. ""And the greens sure look haughty, don't they? Definitely Aerianth's clutch.""

Illatus grins over at Niklo as he watches the hatchlings warily, shuffling his sandals in the sands. ""What was your other guess, then?"" he asks, grinning and glancing up at the galeries again before lowering his eyes back to the sands with a soft sigh.

Tolemic looks down at the much-smaller Niklo. ""You were betting chores?"" he echoes. ""For what? And you're paying attention to the hatchlings, right? Like they told you?""

K'ylon chuckles low, the sound breathy. ""Aye. They are hers alright. And taking their time, too,"" he murmurs to Balinne.

Tannim casts Niklo a sideways glance and gives her as much of a conforting look as he can at the moment, ""Thats why I wouldn't bet, even with you.""

Kamia shifts back and forth, moving closer to Tannim.

Balinne snorts, and her smile is wry now. ""Yea. Probably picking out the ones that are going to give us the biggest headache!"" She sighs, and rubs her own head in anticipation.

<b>The Stately Forest Green strolls along unevenly with unhurried determination as she finally picks up this walking with six limbs thing. No one has yet met her high standards, and so it seems her quest will continue. Red eyes whirl frantically as she deigns to peer at another candidate, then prowling past in a huff as that human yet again fails muster... Wait. Ah, there! Finally. In her excitement she temporarily forgets her manners, hurling her body forward to claim her prize with a proprietary snarl.</b>

Fadra says with a snicker, ""I've got a headache already.""

K'ylon shakes his head. ""Like I said, I probably deserve it.""

Niklo nods, then smiles adorably at Tolemic. ""Yup, chores. An', yer much taller, so s'long as you keep an eye out, an' I stick close t'you, I'm good!"" Perfect logic. Even if she is watching too. To Illatus: ""You'll see soon 'nuff, I'm sure."" A slight frown.

Tzivya shifts her weight, suddenly painfully aware of the heat of the sands and how long it's been since she moved. She's turning back to the hatchlings just in time to catch the Stately Forest Green's eyes, and her own eyes turn into wide saucers of shock. ""Feryth? You're Feryth?"" A wondering hand reaches out, caressing the little green's head with a shuddering sigh. ""Forever, yes, definately forever!""

Balinne jumps, as the dragonet does. ""There we go!"" she says, grinning. ""There's another one, finally."" She's squinting now, peering through the haze to try and see who it is... ""Tzivya!"" Before anyone else can move, she's on her way out there, grining like an idiot. ""Tzivya!"" she says, softer, but none the less excited. ""Come, follow me and we'll get her fed.""

Illatus watches as the green launches herself towards her intended lifemate, letting out a whoop as he realises Tzivya is the intended, ""Way to go, Tzivya,"" he calls out, cheering to her and smiling. He grins at Niklo, ""I'm sure I will,"" he replies.

K'ylon cheers softly. ""Yay Tzivya!"" But most of his attention is upon the remaining dragonets - it'll be his turn soon enough!

Kaelana gives a wry twist of her lips, for once not responging to the comment with a snide comment. She glances across to Tzivya and gestures for Amira to do like-wise, just saying, ""My point exactly.""

Tannim is started as the green lunges towards his position choosing Tzivya next to him. His face lights up in a bright smile as his friend calls out the hatchlings name. ""Oh Tzivya, congrats. See I told you.""

Madge's rock is stolen! The green is given a strange, crinkly look, one that's both irritated and curious, and she's shuffling away from Tzivya to be apart from the others again. ""Um. Good for you."" She'd attempt an awkward pat on the shoulder or something but, well.

Fadra's short stature isn't helping her now - this newest Impression, with that picky green, has her standing on tiptoes. She even lowers her pride enough to put a hand on K'ylon's shoulder, to help her balance, her chin tilted up. ""Who is..."" and then she's flat on her feet again, saying, ""Oh..."" She doesn't even have to tell anyone to go. ""Quick, she is, hmm?"" Fadra asks of K'ylon. ""At least /I/ didn't have t'get her."" A mutter, and Fadra's trying out, ""Feryth. Fer-yth. Feryth. Not bad.""

<b>Powdered Wig Egg shivers, freeing nearby grains of sand to trickle downward from its built-up mound to join their brethren below, then the egg slides to one side, wobbling wildly, the hatchling within unable to bear the stillness of confinement for too long. The grayish flecks on the shell seem to vibrate, losing form like the plucked string of a guitar.</b>

Tolemic takes several hurried steps back as Feryth comes charging. ""Feryth? She's lovely, Tzivya,"" he says, grinning at the sight. ""See, Nik? Gotta stay on your toes. --Say, have you seen any bronzes yet?"" He cranes his neck again to look.

Amira has been watching the greens closely, so she catches when one of them finds Tzivya. ""Tzivya! Congratulations!"" she shouts to her secret buddy. She smiles widely at Kaelana. ""That's one of my friends down.""

Kamia smiles finally at that, but doesn't allow it to distract her, she keeps her eyes on the hatchlings for her safely.

Niklo glares at Illatus, but her expression quickly becomes one of surprise as her best friend Impresses right next to her. ""Tziv!"" the girl gasps, ""Y-you... oh, Tziv."" She grins, voice softening. ""I knew y'would. I knew it!""

Tzivya looks up at Balinne with a mute nod. Her friends, the crowd, the sands - none of them exists. ""She's hungry, so very hungry."" A hand falls to her stomach. ""We are. She is. I mean..."" She confusedly trais off, and then is off after her aunt, with the little green beside them towards where she can be fed.

Illatus also returns his eyes to the other green and the brown lumbering about his sands, his eyes also flickering between the eggs. Time to concentrate now. His sandals shuffles on the black sands.

K'ylon murmurs to Fadra, ""Aye. Not a bad name at all."" He grins a little at the balancing act.

Balinne walks down to the far end of the Cavern.
Balinne has left.

Tzivya walks down to the far end of the Cavern.

<b>Headstrong Stone-Wrought Green snorts determinedly and, with another uplifted jerk of her head, rocks herself back onto all four... and stays upright! With a triumphant little whistle, she takes off towards the row of candidates. Her steps are sure, even in her baby-stage, and though she stumbles now and again, she's quick to recover. In fast succession, two, three, four candidates are passed over with a haughty snort towards each.</b>

Brighid has been here the whole time, almost hiding behind some of the other candidates. She smiles her congratulations to the newest pairs and shifts uncomfortably on the hot sands. Nerviousness radiates from the girl as she watches the eggs and hatchlings.

Nolee shakes her head, leaning into the shade provided by Volath's mass. ""I didn't brush them. They might've brushed each other, though. Mostly they were too busy fighting. Or kissing. Or being contrary. Or all of those things."" A shrug: what can you do?

<b>Shrewd Savannah Brown snorts his triumph at what remains of the nuisance that was his egg before casting a keen eye around the Hatching Sands. All these admirers, these loyal subjects, here to see him? You shouldn't have. But something says he's plenty glad for the observation, even as he stands on legs that are wobbly with the stiffness of being curled. Taking a half-step from his mound, he languorously stretches out his back legs - then his front, and then his wings, all in turn. With all limbs in proper order, he has the good grace to turn around. White. What is all that /white/?</b>

Illatus smiles as his eyes follow Tzivya and her lifemate off the sands, then revert back to watching the green lounging past a line of candidates and the brown getting his feet underneath him. ""They go so quickly,"" he says, glancing at the unhatched eggs.

Kamia can't help it, she lets out a tiny giggle, her hand brushing Tannim's lightly. ""Aren't the sweet?"" She does have the ood sense to remember they are dangerous though, and stays relaxed enough to getout of way.

Madge has taken to biting on her fingernails to keep herself from fraying her robe to pieces with worrying. Every now and again she'll spit, just a little turn of her head and a *ppt*. Her feet seem to be moving of their own accord and she squirms in place, sweat trickling down from her temples and along her cheeks.

Tannim shakes his head at Mic's question, ""No bronzes yet that I have seen."" he gives the older candidate a shrug before noticing Madge has moved away some again. He quickly motions her to rejoin them, ""He we wont bite."" he calls over to her his eyes darting from her and back to the eggs and hatchlings.

""Kissing?"" V'lano has been grinning a pleased smile for the latest impressions, including Tzivya's to that green his Volath was so interested in - but now he glances a more bemused look over at Nolee. ""Fighting? They had wits about them to fight and make up even while the dragons were humming?"" Faux-impressed, the weyrleader looks out at the sands all over again, brows up. ""Well, maybe they're fit for our wings after all, then."" Teasing, mock-serious.

Kaelana shrugs, her good deed of the day (in her opinion at least) ends up unrewarded, the girl already having been watching the greens. She does ask, though, ""Liking the greens are you?""

<b>With a final snort, Headstrong Stone-Wrought Green Dragonet seems to have found what she's looking for. Making an abrupt U-turn, she comes face to face with a strawberry blonde girl, plops herself down, and claims her for her own.</b>

<b>Candidates' Quarters(#1299RAJs$)

The barracks of Ista Weyr are crowded almost Turn round with the Candidates for its queens' Hatching. Cots line both walls and even the space in between. All the cots have a small press at the foot of them for  than most, particularly when the sun's not directly overhead. Tunnels lead off to the bowl and the queens' quarters to southeast and southwest. Tiers of galleries provide seating for spectators, while ledges above offer perchesCandidates' few belongings.
You see several Candidates getting ready for the evening chores and meal.

V'lano makes his way in from the lower caverns.
V'lano has arrived.

Evening, after supper for most, free time; sunset imminent. ""It might be cool enough by now, anyway,"" echoes a voice from just outside in the east cavern through the entrance to the candidates' quarters. There's laughter, merry and bright, then footsteps, then a presence in the entryway: V'lano, putting up one hand on the wall, putting up dark brows, grinning like it would save his life. ""Anyone for a dash into the hatching cavern before it's dark?""

Tzivya, as usual, is laying on her cot with her most recent batch of letters from her friends in distant Weyrs. At the Weyrleader's voice, she quickly scrambles to her feet. ""Sir!"" She says crisply, the closest to him in the cavern. ""Touching, you mean? That would be a lot of fun, I've watched them lots and have been hoping we would get to!""

Amira looks up in surprise. She's sitting cross-legged on her cot, mending a tear in her shirt. Understanding lightens her eyes and she quickly stands and heads toward the entrance.

Free time is well and good when you have something to do, but Niklo, it would seem, does not. The girl is on her back staring at the ceiling, slowly starting to drift off thanks to the somewhat overindulgent meal she recently had. The sound of first V'lano's voice, and then others responding to his inquiry rouses her and she sits up, rubbing at her eyes. ""Uhm... huh?"" she asks, tilting her head. ""What's goin' on, now?""

Brighid looks up as the Weyrleader enters, her eyes widening at the prospect of actually going out on the sands, even if it isn't time for the hatching yet.. The drawing she'd been working on while sitting on her cot forgotten. Neilan chirps questioningly and the girl shushes him while waiting for the answer to Tzivya's question, ""No, Neilan. You're staying here.""

""Touching them, yes,"" allows V'lano. ""Clothes and shoes required. I assume I'll meet you all in the stands in a snap."" A waggle of black brow and he turns his back on the quarters, taking off at stride.

V'lano has left.

""You know,"" Tzivya says, giggling. ""It worries me that he has to point out that clothing is required..."" And with that she turns towards Niklo, ""Nik! C'mon, we can go together!"" She offers the girl a hand, ""Been waiting for this since Kintryth did this to me!""

Amira grins and waits by the entrance for her friends, since she's all ready to go. ""Come on, you'll miss what you've been waiting for."" She gestures toward the doorway impatiently.

Niklo starts to make a face, then shrugs. ""Shoes... shardit, shoes..."" the girl grumbles, dropping to her knees beside her cot and peering underneath it, ""I get why, but... well, they're somewhere under 'ere..."" Groping about wildly she finally pulls out a pair of worn rope sandals and ties them on, hopping from one foot to another as she stumbles to follow Tzivya. ""Lead on, I'm comin'!""

Brighid scrambles off her cot, tucking the half finished drawing into her press so that the little blue can't ruin it while she's gone. She slips her feet into her boots, pausing only long enough to tie them. She giggles in agreement with Tzivya's comment and nods. She apparently is trying to keep it together and only marginally succeding.

<b>East Cavern(#1092RJLs)

This cavern continues from the rooms curving away to the west, and curls slightly around to the south-southeast as it heads towards the tunnel leading further into the Weyr. Open-top glass globes of glows are spaced between every other curtained door that lines the northern and southeastern run of the cavern. This busy cavern passes through a narrowing corridor on its southeastern curve. An archway on the easternmost side of the southern wall leads out of the Weyr.

The cavern narrows to the southeast. On the northeastern wall, a narrow archway opens into the Meeting Room, another archway to the south leading to the Bathing Pools. Nearby, a curtained entrance leads into the Candidates' Quarters.

The sunset bathes the northeastern side of the bowl in red light.
The wet summer season oppresses the island with high humidity and sweltering temperatures. As the sun sets, clouds interrupt the sky and a nice, light breeze carries the scent of sea air.

It is enormous to say the least, and the gentle breeze blowing in through the entrance behind you, to the southwest accentuates its size. Spreading around the back side of the grounds itself are the Galleries, where guests can sit and watch the action and quietly cheer candidates on. Below that is the black sand itself, where the candidates stand.

Twin arches lead out into the expanse of the bowl. Ledges overhead provide space for winged creatures, and a set of stone seats begin nearby.

<b>Hatching Galleries -- Ista Weyr(#1300RJQqs)

The galleries provide more than adequate seating for guests who have been invited to watch a hatching. There are ten tiers, that arch in a semi-circle from the southwest to west side of the black stone cavern. Stairs lead down to the entrances, which are visible beyond the large gaping opening leading to the Senior Queen's Weyr. You have a view of the Hatching Sands as well as a clear view of the ledges up above you.
The people here are V'lano, Caitlyn, and Amira.  
Scattered among the smaller perches are firelizards, including Fuzz, and Infelice.

Tzivya comes in with the other Candidates, grinning widely and bouncing along as she walks, holding Niklo's hand tightly. ""C'mon!"" She says, speeding up as she sees the Weyrleader. ""This is gonna be great! I want to see that pink one, and the red one, and that other one I like!""

V'lano, having no shoes to pull on and a head start, is waiting in the stands as the evening's selection of candidates begin to arrive. The weyrleader holds a pose on the landing just above the stairs that lead down to the sands, one hand on the rail, hip leaned against it; in the other hand, a drink, mixed, sunset yellow and red and gold with a sliver of citron floating in it. Prepared, then. He waits for arrivals to stop before he looks up into the group and begins. ""The rules for the sands tonight are simple: no pushing, no shoving, no running, no roughhousing. If I ask anyone to leave the sands you come up here immediately, no questions until you're in the seats - and if Aerianth becomes upset, I send you all home. Otherwise we're here 'til it's dark. Any questions?""

Nearer the back of the Galleries, a short, tanned female form is splayed lengthwise over one of the many long benches, clad only in a swimsuit and sarong. About her prone, deeply napping form are gathered stray puddles of seawater - likely byproducts of the soggy outerwear - and a loose scrap of hide is tossed over her eyes and forehead. Above the top of her brunette head are a loose stack of some other hides, and from just beneath that small hide scrap over her face drifts up a chorus of soft snores.

Niklo doesn't look quite as energetic as the rest of the candidates - or at least Tzivya - but allows herself to be dragged along just the same. ""I'm comin', I'm comin'!"" she replies, rolling her eyes just a little but amused nonetheless. ""The eggs ain't goin' anyplace yet... an' even if they are, we'll know about it."" When V'lano begins to speak she falls silent, nodding understanding even if he probably won't see it amidst the others.

Amira grins, coming in behind Tzivya. ""That other one? I thought that if you liked something, you knew how to describe it."" She calms down as the weyrleader speaks and nods solemnly in compliance.

Brighid follows the other candidates up, looking increasingly nervious about being so near the great golden queen. She nods and quickly takes her place with the other candidates, her hands folded neatly in the folds of her skirt.

Tzivya nods distractedly, the nod of someoen who has heard this speech, or one like it, at least a dozen times. ""Yes, sir!"" She chirps in a similarly distant voice. Her eyes and attention are focused on the target of their evening, the eggs on the sands. ""Well, see, I like them all, and I just haven't decided WHICH one I wanna see after those two!"" She replies to Amira. She points to the Dramatic Mask egg, ""Maybe that one!""

Snores do not qualify as questions and apparently bypass the Weyrleader's notice. ""All right then. One last thing - advice more than instruction - I suggest you touch several eggs, as many as you can. On the other hand, if you feel a real pull to spend more time with a given egg, do so - just don't prevent others from having a turn."" A pause, eyes glinting up at the faces of the candidates waiting. Then he shifts his hips back to stand flush against the rail, clearing the way to the stars so they'll have to file by him to go past. A gesture of his drink welcomes them: ""On you go.""

Amira waits for several of the candidates to pass before starting toward the stairs, so that she doesn't contribute to clogging.

<b>Hatching Sands(#1296RJqs$)

This huge cavern arcs high overhead, a volcanic bubble in matte black rock left open to the wide sky at the top. The black sand of the Istan hatching grounds reflects less light than a paler sand would; as a result the cavern is darker than most, particularly when the sun's not directly overhead. Tunnels lead off to the bowl and the queens' quarters to southeast and southwest. Tiers of galleries provide seating for spectators, while ledges above offer perches for dragons.

Besides the span of the galleries to the south, one can head over towards the entrance to the hatching grounds, or into one of the Queen's tunnels to the southeast and southwest.

The only person on the dark sands is Tzivya. Dragons here include Aerianth, and Volath.

Amira walks down from the galleries.
Amira has arrived.

Tzivya has released Niklo to her own devices; in fact, noone else seems to exist in the little world she lives in now as she power-walks across the sands towards the eggs. Sure, they were told not to run, and she is carefully obeying that while going as fast as she can. The Dramatic Mask Egg is her goal; in contrast to what she said, she goes for the last one to be on her mind. She stops next to it, then looks up at the clutchmother nearby. A niggling in the back of her mind has her curtseying to her politely before turning back to the egg. Finalyl, her hand reaches out, delicately caressing the top of the dark orb before her.

V'lano walks down from the galleries.
V'lano has arrived.

Niklo follows Tzivya onto the sands, bowing rather awkwardly to Aerianth first of all and then moving to one side, letting the others spread out while she watches. It isn't until everyone else is absorbed with the eggs that she finally moves towards one, the very large, very soft-looking Red Velvet Swag Egg.

Brighid walks down from the galleries.
Brighid has arrived.

Amira sidesteps as soon as she gets to the sand and looks around cautiously. Her eyes linger on the gold, and she bows respectively to her. Then she heads toward Tulle on the Twirl Egg. Her hand hovers over the laced egg for a moment before settling lightly on it. The second hand joins it, and together they carress the hardening surface.

V'lano now gets to do a great deal of not much. He checks, of course and first, on the queen; having ascertained she is unlikely to express disapproval -too- soon, he retreats to a spot where he can lean against the wall below the gallery rail and observe the candidates at their 'work.'

Tzivya's eyes are wide and her breathing is fast as she touches the egg. Carefully she kneels beside it, her hands never leaving it's surface as she explores every inch of it's midnight surface. ""It's so warm, and not at all like how I was expecting it to feel. Not quite leather, but... I can't compare it to anything!"" Who she is talking to is anyone's guess.

Niklo brushes her fingertips over the egg, lightly, then wrinkles her nose. ""Ain't so soft as it looks,"" she comments quietly to herself, though she can't help but grin lopsidedly. ""Still real pretty, ju's the same..."" With that she lets her hand flatten, so palm and fingers are pressed lightly against the shell. ""Real pretty, sure.""

Amira takes a step away from the egg, her hand lingering on it as long as possible. As soon as she no longer feels the egg, she turns her attention on A Thousand Burning Lamps Egg. She keeps her eyes on the shining egg as she walks toward it, stepping lightly as the heat penetrates her shoes. She runs her hands over the new egg, then puts an ear next to its surface. She grins to herself.

Brighid follows the others down, bowing respectfully to Aerianth, and just wanders among the eggs for a few minutes before finding herself standing before the Thousand Burning Lamps egg. She reaches out hesitantly toward the hardening surface, her hand pausing a moment before she allows herself to touch it, the tips of her fingers barely brushing the shell.

In the galleries, A firelizard sneezes.

Tzivya's attention wanders and soon she is darting away. Now her list is remembered, and as Amira moves away from the Tulle egg, she passes Tzivya who is on her way to it. Tzi gives a dazzling smile to her friend before she turns towards the other egg. She again kneels, and this time can't help but press her ear to it, trying hard to see if she can hear anything stirring within the near-mature egg.

In the galleries, Yes, ignore that vagrant snoozer behind the curtain...or something. The woman continues to rack up the z's - likely too tired, or too something - to let the minor hub-bub of some Candidates awaken her. The whole atmosphere around them inside the Hatching Grounds is humid, too-warm, cloying.

Niklo hovers over the richly colored red egg another moment, then steps back to watch two girls at the Thousand Burning Lamps Egg. A shadow of a smirk crosses her face, then vanishes as she turns and stars walking across the sands from where she currently is, sights set on the In The Pit Egg.

Amira looks around the egg at Brighid and smiles. ""This is a pretty one, isn't it?"" She rubs the egg a little before starting away. Her sights are set on From the Rafters Egg, and soon she is kneeling before it, going through the motions that the earlier eggs recieved. She slowly gets through a good number of the eggs as time goes on.

Brighid nods, suddenly very shy toward someone she's spent day and night with for the last month or so. She only lingers for a moment, not even letting the plam of her hand touch the egg before she practically flees. She continues her aimless wandering, doing her best to avoid the other candidates while randomly brushing her fingertips against a few of the eggs before winding up t the In the Spotlight egg.

""This is an awfully quiet group,"" V'lano says. To no one. Nobody at all. Back to the galleries, elbow against the wall, drink being sipped from moment to moment. Casual as anything.

Whatever Tzi hears or doesn't hear brings a pleased smile to her face, and she's up in an instant and padding off. She passes by the In The Pit egg and grins to her adopted sister there before moving on to Red Velvet Swag Egg. Her turn to run fingers over the richly colored oval. She looks over towards the Weyrleader as his voice carries in the quiet room. ""Candidates should be seen and not heard, we've been told!"" She offers with a cheeky grin.

In the galleries, Trace has been here a while, serving a punishment of some sort or other and having been cleaning some of the benches in the stands in prepartion for the recent Hatching...now that Trace truly cares about that. But, he still serves his time deligently, reaching the last tier section he's to clean, staring at the bucket of water he carries with a rag. He's already spent so much time here...and he had to come back tomorrow anyways...so would it really be so bad to cheat on this one? Deciding in the end that it would not, and without looking at the place he's tossing it, he lifts the bucket and with a grunt he heaves the water out of the bucket and along the section, down towards benches from above. Unfortunately, he notices only afterwards, that it's directly where a person is actually...sleeping? Poor Caitlyn.

V'lano gives as good as he gets, a master of cheek: ""Well, you -are- all lovely to look at."" Brow-twitch, sip, glinting wink at Tzivya. ""Probably another quarter-hour or so until dark,"" he adds in a broader tone for the benefit of the whole group.

In the galleries, Nolee hears the splashing, probably, of the water across the benches, and that draws her out from where she'd been leaning -- hiding? No no, leaning, of course, against a back wall area. She giggles, then winces as the water trickles downward possibly toward the sleeping someone target.
.
Niklo doesn't avert her course, but it becomes a slightly less straight one as she weaves from side to side to press her palm against the eggs on the way. V'lano's call, however, gets her back on track and she picks up her pace a bit and finally reaches her destination. ""There,"" the girl sighs at last, outline a splotch of color on the egg. Then, wasting no more time, she moves on to another egg.

Tzivya stands up straight, striking a dramatic pose for V'lano; appropriate, considering the environment. Then she dissolves into giggles, leaning a bit on the egg next to her as she indulges in the mirth. But the leaning reminds her of why they are here, and she is quickly distracted and off again. Volume over quality seems to be her theme, fingers brushing over a few eggs as she passes them on her way to the Makeup Spill Egg.

In the galleries, There's a rather loud sound resembling a firelizard's SQUAWK!, and Cait's prone figure jerks upright - her entire form now liberally splashed with dirty water - her startled features quickly transforming into something more resembling a volcano about to blow. ""What the SHELL?!!"" she calls...and suddenly realizes where she is. Her lips clamp shut, but her eyes bug out slightly as she fixes her livid gaze on...Trace. Ohh, the anger... Which only increases as she gasps, and pivots on a hip to stare at her pile of hidework...the ink now spattered and sprayed into illegible blots. ""trACE!""

A soft sigh escapes Brighid's slender form as she finally rests both hands on the warm surface of the In the Spotlight egg. She closes her eyes and seems to be trying to listen to the egg, the girl leaning forward and almost putting her left ear on the shell. After a moment she sighs again and goes back to wandering, soon finding herself beforethe Powdered Wig egg. She repeats her actions with the In the Spotlight egg, gently running her hands over the Powdered Wig egg's surface.

In the galleries, Nolee's wince deepens, much exaggerating the already-pronounced lines in her face, and she puts her hands up to cover her eyes as though that would make Caity's horrible ruined hidework go away and reappear all better. She peeks through her fingers, softly makes an oops noise, and watches intently to see what will happen next, heedless of the moving bodies out on the sands below.

Niklo is just passing the Opening Night Jitters Egg when she hears a yell and promptly looks up, recognizing both voice and name. This time she really does smirk, but only briefly, as though such amusement at someone else's expense might offend the clutch parents and the young, unhatched eggs. Instead she turns to the egg she's about to pass and gives it her full attention.

V'lano chokes a bit on a sip of his drink, then turns around to eye the galleries - his gaze is swift to find the source of the racket, and down on the sands, Aerianth is aware, too, a low murmur her first signal that she might consider this a little excessive in the noise department. The Weyrleader huffs a laugh at Caitlyn and Trace, then turns around again to face the eggs. ""All right, say your last good-byes and pack it up. I'll be in trouble if I keep you out too late."" The jovial tone in this last bit makes it sound a bit like a joke, though the initial command is serious enough.

In the galleries, Trace's eyes slowly grow rather wide as Caitlyn gets hit by the water and seems rather...umm...upset. The young boy drops the bucket as she says his name and looks like a deer in headlights, wanting to run, but frozen in the spot. This isn't good...

A furtive glance around, and Tzivya leans down to the egg. Perhaps to listen, perhaps to smell... Or perhaps she gave it a quick kiss? It's hard to tell, as quick as the motion is. And then she is skipping off across the sands towards the Galleries, her eyes going to the stricken bluerider and her tormentor. A light laugh escapes her as she calls out to her friend, ""S'what you get for sleeping in the galleries, ma'am! Oughta know better by now!""

In the galleries, Caitlyn is in 'mood' right now, though she tries not to let the suddenly noticed Candidates and Weyrleader far below hear the brunt of her furious tirade. Good luck, since her voice keeps rising and falling in timbre and volume as she fights for control of it. Her entire form heaves up from the bench, and is inclined menacingly over Trace's - though they don't differ too much in height, really. The bluerider's aura of towering (rage) likely comes from some other, more inward source. A long finger stabs out like a dagger at the youth, while her teeth clench and eyes continue to bug. ""What. The. SHARDS do you think you're doing?!"" Caity is almost gagging on her efforts to keep her volume down. ""Look what you did to meEE!"" She glares down at her filthy form, then stabs that finger over to her ruined hides. ""WORSE! Look what you did to *all* my *work!""

In the galleries, Caitlyn GLARES down like a wildwoman at Tzivya, and it seems to channel much of Fadra on a very, very bad day.

Brighid glances up at the galleries only for a moment as she moves on, stopping short when she hears V'lano's order to leave. She pouts a little, obviously dissapointed that they can't linger, but nods anyway, ""Yes, sir."" She pauses once again beside the Thousand Burning Lamps egg, giving it a farewell caress and murmering something uninteligable to the baby contained in the hardening shell, before making her way back to the galleries and the confrontation going on there.

Sighing softly as she gvives the egg one last pat... Niklo seems to cheer up considerably at all the yelling going on. ""Lil' runt,"" she mutters under her breath, ""Guess I ain't the only one he's gotta watch out for."" A snicker, and she starts to make her way across the sands to the exit, seeing as she's about as far from it as she can be at the moment.

In the galleries, Nolee can't help it: Caitlyn looks like a wet feline, and eventually her bubbling up mirth must out itself. It does, in a burst of giggles that push her hands right away from her face with the force of the laughter. Immediately she's apologizing for finding humor in her friend's unfortunate situation, adding an earnest, ""He didn't mean to, really.""

""All right. Everyone up into the galleries and steer clear of the bluerider on your way by."" V'lano waves them toward the stands and steps back, so they can file past him. ""Any favorites - ?"" A question asked for answers along the trip, evidently.

Tzivya falls into step with the Weyrleader, and grins brightly. ""I like them all, but I think the pink one is nice, and that pretty dark one I looked at first."" If she's being GLARED at, she's oblivious. Or maybe not, as she sends the bluerider a cheeky smile as she climbs back to the galleries. ""They are /all/ lovely, though!""
Niklo catches up with most of the others, so she blends into the middle of the group and isn't last. ""Dunno how anybody could pick,"" she comments, half in reply to V'lano's question and half to herself. ""They're all real nice. But..."" a grin, ""Don't matter so much what's on the outside. The inside's the real important part!""

V'lano climbs to the seating tiers from the sands.
V'lano has arrived.

If one didn't think Trace's eyes could get bigger...well, obviously they're wrong. The go so wide it's a surprise they don't pop out of his head. ""I...I didn't mean too...I'm sorry."" He stutters out, trying to take a step back to get away from the angered rider. If he was smart he'd turn and run, but his body won't let him. ""I'm really...really...sorry."" He says, swallowing quickly.

A meek nod greets the Weyrleader's question, ""The Thousand Burning Lamps egg is very pretty..."" Brighid carefully avoids Caitlyn, giving the wet bluerider a wide berth, ""I just hope that they all find who they're looking for when they hatch."" Seems the girl is a little overcome.

""Well, the point of a touching is to see if you can get some sense for something on the inside,"" V'lano grins in Niklo's direction. ""Although the legitimacy of that kind of thinking I wouldn't myself put all of your faith in - I am rather fond of the pink one myself, Tzivya,"" he adds, turning that way for a sip of his drink to cheer her with a merry glance for her flattery. ""But the gray one is -my- favorite.""

Caitlyn is like a laser, in both sights and heat. Her wet, dishevelled form smakes about like a predator, buggy eyes fixing on Nolee just above and a little beyond her - the bluerider's face now burning crimson from embarrassment, in addition to the heat of her anger.... Even more so when V'lano says *that*. In a fit of towering pique, her hand snags a ruined hide next to her, and hurls it towards the laughing and apologizing Nolee. And back again Cait pivots - GLARING at Tzivya as she passes - and raising a fist to shake it at the Candidate. Back to Trace she rounds, the short woman venting even more: ""You *slob*! Didn't you even take the time to /see/ me up here?! I layed in plain-sharding SIGHT! you *don't* SLOP the stands! You WIPE them DOWN!"" her finger stabs back and forth between the boy and the granite.

A moment, and then with a glance for Caitlyn and a subdued, barely-interruptive-of-flirting, ""Oh, my,"" escapes the weyrleader's droll mouth.

Nolee is still giggling, though the sound's turned to that hiccoughing noise that suggests there's an iota of difficulty with that whole breathing thing. She's just about managed to get it under control when a sloshy hide is incoming, and she ducks it, leaving it perfectly clear to flop right over her head and onto her back, where it drips onto her blouse, conforms, and clings in place. She stands back up, ""Ha's"" as she thinks it missed her cleanly, then gives Trace a sorrowful face. Girl has a point.

Tzivya is unrepentant under the bluerider's glare, seeming to grow more amused as the woman's ire grows. But she keeps silent on the issue now, instead turning towards V'lano, ""Really? Most boys don't seem to like pink things, something about it being too girly, but I guess a bronzerider can get away with it cause they have a dragon to prove their manhood for them!"" She glances to Nik and grins more, ""And true enough! Bali says she doesn't even remember what Zelieth's egg looks like, she was too busy loving her to notice which it was!""

Trace continues to stare at Caitlyn, bug-eyed and with his jaw moving up and down as he tries to say something...anything more...but no words come out as the rider continues to vent at him, leaving him no room to get in a word edge-wise. About all he manages to squeak out is another tiny, soft, ""sorry"". He doesn't even turn to look at those coming off the sands, or Nolee who did attempt to at least try and ease the anger. He's afraid he'll lose his head if he looks away.

Niklo conaiser's the weyrleader's words, then shrugs. ""I dunno... I know there's somethin' inside, but I don't really think it's 'cuz I touched the eggs, y'know? More that I already know there's babies inside."" A little sigh. ""Jus' goes t'show how much I know, even bein' at a weyr my whole life..."" All the commotion, however, keeps the girl from getting too down about the whole thing.

A dark brow arches at Tzivya. ""I could name a handful of pink things I rather like,"" draws out the weyrleader, eyes mischievious. ""But my weyrwoman might not thank me for sharing."" Back to Niklo then - ""I'm inclined to agree with you, just so you know. If we were innocent of the ways of dragons, would this be mysterious - or just a bunch of eggs?"" A gesture of his drink at the sands they departed; then V'lano tips off a little salute, tilting his head first to Niklo, then Tzivya. ""Ladies,"" generous term in at least Niklo's case, ""If you'll excuse me?"" He hits his stride after that evidently, moving with greater speed up the stairs.

Caitlyn doesn't even waste a second looking towards Nolee to see if her hide connected - she's focused on Trace - still trying to rein her temper in. ""YOU. *pant* YOU. Will stay HERE. *pant* And rewash this *ENTIRE* row *pant* of Benches! The PROPER way! And i'll be coming back to inspect you work! If I see... *pant* even a dram of water... OR DIRT.../anywhere/, i'll have your hide over my KNEE!"" Oh the outrage! And, her fit of anger managing to grow to apoplectic dimensions as she takes stock of all those gathered about - gawping at her - Caitlyn suddenly grabs up her sodden pile of useless hides, and storms off like a tornado - avoiding touching anyone.

As her form disappears though the exit, a sudden bellowing howl can be heard - rising into a screech of fury.

Nolee continues to gawp, especially as her usually jovial friend remains so sour, even to her departure. ""Er,"" she starts, shrugging helplessly at Trace. ""Guess you have to clean again."" A pause, thoughtful, then ""Wonder if she'd do it, really?"" Rather than embarrass Trace further, she heads down the steps as well, taking care after she trips once. A few, ""'scuse me's"" take her past the candidates, though she pauses a moment to regard the eggs, as if just noticing them there at all, before she goes out.

Tzivya looks after the Weyrleader and turns a bright, beet-red color. ""Oh."" She says, simply. Then Caitlyn is stalking off, and things seem to be relaxing. She nudges Nik and mutters to her, ""Gonna head back into the barracks, I need to write Loree a letter tonight before she finds me and spanks me. See you later sis!"" And she's off towards the stairs out, not quite fleeing.

Trace stares at Caitlyn as she gives her instructions of cleaning it all....again?! Well, he's not about to argue. Instead, he waits until after she's gone before sighing heavily, his eyes losing their buggy look as he turns his attention to the work he has to re-do. He ignores everyone else in the stands at this point, simply looking sad and a bit upset, likely wanting to be left alone.

Tzivya walks down the stairs towards the entrance.
Tzivya has left.

A blinkblinkblink at V'lano and Niklo just grins, shaking her bowed head to hide a faint blush of embarrassment. She climbs the stairs in silence, careful to stay near Tzivya, as though the older girl will protect her from the 'excitement' that's going on . Not that she's scared! Oh no. She's just too familiar with the participants and would rather not be noticed. ""Right,"" she mumbles when her friend head off, suddenly looking a bit concerned. ""I... I'm gonna go to back too, I think,"" the girl says a bit louder to no one in particular. ""Bedtime..."" Inching away a few steps, she turns and walks - quickly - back to the barracks.

<b>Ista Weyr Living Cavern(#1100RJMs$)
The hot midday sun shines into the living cavern here through the bowl entrance, on the northwestern wall. This huge cavern is filled with tables, and an occasional rider here or there for the midday meal. Four large hearths line the northern wall, all actively preparing for the evening meal, leaving the cavern uncomfortably warm. To the west, a large tunnel leads out of the cavern, connecting it with the rest of the lower caverns.
Several huge tapestries, many of them ancient, are hanging on the stone walls. One particularly glorious one looks to be a study on the finger rock. You also see several 'places' to sit.

The Living Cavern is mostly empty, as it's not a 'normal' eating time, but it's a time after Trace has completed his newest set of chores brought on as another punishment for some mischief, and it can be shown by the dirt smears on his face...apparently is was a bit muddy wherever he was. He now sits along at a table, the young boy with a plate of food and a glass of juice, both of which he seems to be going through very quickly.

Arms crossed, eyes narrowed, and otherwise pleasant face wrinkled inward thanks to a scowl, Niklo enters the living cavern surrounded by her own personal stormcloud. ""Lousy good-fer-nothin',"" the girl grumbles, gallomphing over to the spread of food on the table and beginning to fill a plate, ""I used up all my good spare time, an' whadda I get? Nothin'!"" A meatroll is mostly squashed in one hand as she picks it up just a little too roughly.

Trace continues to go through his food at a rather good pace, though it's about right since he hasn't eaten all day and it's already going on into the afternoon. As Niklo enters his eyes raise to blink at her curiously, chewing his food as he watches her in all her grumpiness, and he watches curiously as she squishes the meatroll. That's not nice. He doesn't say anything, but continues to watch her blatantly, taking another bite of food. Interesting...

Funny how being angry makes you especially observant, and Trace isn't really trying to hide anything anyway. Irritated by her now-squished meatroll (nevermind that it was her fault to begin with!), Niklo turns to take it out in the easiest and closest way. ""Jus' whadda ya think yer lookin' at?"" she snaps at the boy about her age, taking a menacing step forward. ""Huh?""

Trace doesn't seem in the bit frightened or disturbed by the anger or menacing look. I mean, really, you're talking to the one who gets it all the time from riders and people in charge as he's always pulling pranks and getting in trouble. It just...doesn't have the same effect anymore. ""You."" The simply and honest statement is spoken before he takes another bite of food.

Niklo's expression lightens up slightly when her mood doesn't affect the boy, but her tone isn't any lighter when she replies, ""Well, knock it off 'fore I decide to help ya."" The threat in both tone and words isn't very great, however, if the white strand through the knot on her shoulder means anything to her. She does glare in Trace's direction and then turns back to filling her plate.

Trace doesn't stop, but in fact is really quite enjoying this...after all, all he does in life is cause trouble...He doesn't say anything more, however, but simply raises an eyebrow and continues to watch Niklo, taking yet another bite of his almost empty plate.

Niklo completes her food pyramid, as suggested, with a sweet -- carefully balancing a bubbly on top of everything and, acting as though she doesn't see Trace watching her, takes a seat right next to him. Then, still pretending not to notice the boy, she proceeds to work on her pile of food. Bubbly, of course, first.

Trace takes a few more bites until his food is gone, plate nicely cleared, and yet his eyes never leaving Niklo even as she sits next to him. He continues to watch her, quite amused and intrigued by the girl, and still remains silent as he watches...and waits.

Niklo finishes off the bubbly and licks her fingers with slow, deliberate rudeness. Then she picks up a thick slice of bread, uses her fingers to spread the lump of butter on it around, and pauses to lick her fingers once again. The whole time she pointedly ignores Trace, not so much as glancing, let alone turning, to take note of him.

A battle of wills, is it? Well, that's even more interesting...except that Trace isn't really interested in it. Instead, after a few moments of her pointedly ignoring him, he reaches over to try and snatch a bit of bread from her plate. Hey, he's still hungry...and he's been doing chores all day...he doesn't want to get up to get more food when it's so close at hand.

And that's the beauty of playing the ignore game. Either the other person gets bored and goes away... or they do something to warrent a reaction. What's the result? Why, a win-win situation, of course! ""Hey,"" Niklo's voice is mild but her reaction is not; a tightly balled fist smashes down on the table where Trace's reaching hand is, or, should he not move quickly enough, his hand itself. ""Mine.""

Trace blinks and withdraws his hand quickly as she attempts to smash it, grinning mischeviously, then putting on his best sad, puppy-dog eyes and all look. ""But...but...shouldn't you share?"" He asks, managing a little sniffle at the end. Oh yes, he's good...but a little overboard at the moment.

Niklo still doesn't look at the boy, so she doesn't spot the grin, or the eyes, or any other expression he makes. She does catch the sniffle, but all the earns is an eyeroll and a flat, ""Nope."" Then she goes back to laying bit sof cold wherry on the literally hand-buttered bread.

Trace's grin turns into a frown at her single word. Why...she's just heartless! Trace tries again, giving a soft whimper. ""But...I might starve..."" He says, putting as much sadness into his voice as possible.

""An' I care... why?"" Heartless indeed! Niklo sounds almost bored as she says this, brushing him off lightly and taking a large bite out of her open-wherry sandwich. Chewing slowly she adds, ""'Sides, if yer so hungry go an' getcher own food. S'right over there. Even some'un as pathetic as you should be able to make it."" Another bite of her sandwich.

Trace pouts a bit at the harshness of the heartless one. ""Yer not very nice."" He states blandly then, just staring at her now.

Niklo turns, still chewing, and smirks. ""Aw, really? I'm so sorry, yer absolutely right! I shoulda jus' letcha steal food off my plate without even askin'. Where *are* my manners?"" The girl swallows, then snaps, ""Ask next time, an' mebbe I'll letcha have somethin', dimglow.""

Caitlyn walks in from the bowl.
Caitlyn has arrived.

""Dimglow!?"" Trace says, looking a little taken aback, ""That's really not nice."" He retorts, then snorts softly, ""Fine, I'll go get my own food then."" He stands from the table the two of them were sitting at, taking his plate and going back to begin putting more food on it. Stupid girls...

Caitlyn ambles into the cavern, an armful of hides tucked under her left arm, a slightly relieved look on her features. The woman moves to the serving tables, and cautiously pours herself a large mug of citron juice, then peering out at the assembled masses of Weyrfolk - trying to find a table that isn't already stuffed with people. Ah...there's one. She strides over to the table that houses Niklo and Trace, and mumbles, ""Mind if I join you?"" A purely polite and rhetorical question, since Cait begins to seat herself.

Before Trace is entirely finished speaking Niklo begins clapping loudly. ""Now yer learnin'!"" she calls patronizingly, settling back in her seat to watch while finishing off her sandwich. That is, until Caitlyn arrives and makes herself at home. ""Oh, 'ello,"" the girl greets the rider with a lopsided grin. ""Help yerself.""

Trace looks back and narrows his eyes at Niklo as she calls out and he frowns at her a moment...then his eyes lighten a bit as he gets an idea. Within moments he has a plate of food once again and a cup of juice, and moves to sit back down next to Niklo, placing both on the table in front of him. Settled, he reaches towards the cup as if he means to pick it up...but instead tips it over and it falls off the table upside down...into Niklo lap. ""Oops."" Trace comments simply, then turns back to his plate.

Caitlyn give Niklo a smile, settling that stack of hides onto the table just a little bit away from her, polpping her rear onto a seat, and taking a deep draught from her mug. ""Hey, you're...uhm, Niklo, correct?"" the bluerider must've remembered her from the previous night in the bathing pools...and Cait suddenly remembers details of *that* - a slightly pensive look slipping over her face for a moment. At Trace's sudden overturning of his drink into the girl's lap... Well, she peers with a little surprise over at Trace, then back at Niklo, slightly curious as to their interaction...then decides to let them handle it.

Unfortunately for Niklo, she sees the cup tipping. Yes, she sees it just fine, which makes it all the worse when she can't move fast enough to stop it and ends up with a lapful of sticky juice. Immediately she's on her feet, chair toppling over behind her, one hand slamming down on the table. ""You little..."" she snarls, hand not on the table trembling in an effort not to reach out and grab the boy by the shirt -- or better yet, the throat. Somehow she manages to restrain herself, though Caitlyn's words are all but forgotten. ""Yer gonna get it, runt,"" the girl threatens, shaking her fist at him, ""Jus' you wait 'till the hatching's over. Then I'll be free t'letcha have what's comin' to ya...""

Trace goes about munching on his food non-chalantly, as if the juice tipping was no big deal. And then at Niklo's words, Trace just shrugs as well, taking another bite before saying, ""S'okay, you couldn't hurt anything bigger then a grub anyways.""

Caitlyn groans inwardly at the ruckus taking place in front of her, her peace all-too-fleeting. Her mug it thunked down onto the table with some force - sending a little slosh of juice over one side - thankfully not the one her hides have been placed on - and she grumbles to Niklo, ""Candidate, restrain yourself. You're making a scene."" And to Trace, she grunts, ""Put a sock in it, Trace."" great, now someone is slightly grumpy.

Niklo begins to reply to Trace's comment, but cuts herself short as Caitlyn speaks. Instead she reaches down to pick up her chair, setting it upright again and plopping grumpily onto it. ""Yes'm,"" she says quietly to the rider, going back to her food. But even more quietly, to Trace, she adds, ""You go ahead an' think that, runt. But watcher back after hatchin'...""

""I'm not scared'a you."" Trace replies back to Niklo just as quietly, though he does sober up a bit at Caitlyn's words and turns back to his food, falling quiet then and paying no mind to anyone else...just his food.

Caitlyn lets Niklo's extra little comment pass, though her brows scrunch together a little more at Trace's - giving the boy a glower. Damned kids. She carefully picks up her mug, and takes another few hefty swigs from it, trying to clear some unpleasant taste from her mouth, then setting it down. A sudden thought, and the woman snags her voluminous hidework from the table's surface, depositing it on the seat next to her - and pulling it away from the table. Better prepared than...angry. Nope, not saying anything right now... Just trying to garner some peace.

Niklo doesn't say a word for a long moment, collecting herself. And then she just grins at Trace's comment, letting that be her reply and say all she needs wordlessly. With that she goes back to her food, taking a bite out of a slice of cold herdbeast and turning to Caitlyn in an attempt to change the subject. ""So... uhm..."" the girl searches for a topic, but comes up empty-handed.

Trace catches the grin, and can't help but smile slightly himself as he continues his meal. He blinks suddenly as a small brown flit appears in the air above his head, winging in to land on the table next to Trace and, with no preamble, snagging a chunk of meat. ""Well fine then, eat."" He mutters to the creature as it takes the meat a little ways away and begins to devour it.

Caitlyn peers over at Niklo, her expression mostly bland, awaiting something more lucid from the girl's mouth than that previous comment. There's something...odd in the bluerider's eyes, a sneaky little glint that refuses to be hidden beneath her mostly polite demeanor. Could it be that Cait is taking some inner glee in Niklo's discomforture? Eh, whatever...she gives a glance over to Trace and his brown firelizard - and a small smirk actually cracks her frozen features. ""That's the one you Impressed from Little Sock, right?""

Niklo finally closes her mouth and gives up. She can't figure out what she's going to say... and besides, that juice is getting sticky. That stormy aura from earlier returns and, jaw set, the girl stands and turns to exit the cavern since she's obviously not having a very good time here. ""Gonna... go clean up,"" she mumbles, leaving the half-finished plate of food and moving quickly to get away.

<b>Hatching Galleries -- Ista Weyr(#1300RJQqs)
The galleries provide more than adequate seating for guests who have been invited to watch a hatching. There are ten tiers, that arch in a semi-circle from the southwest to west side of the black stone cavern. Stairs lead down to the entrances, which are visible beyond the large gaping opening leading to the Senior Queen's Weyr. You have a view of the Hatching Sands as well as a clear view of the ledges up above you.
The people here are Fadra, G'tive, and Kaelana.   
Stairs to the southwest lead out of the hatching grounds. Please type '+viewhelp' to see information on checking out the clutch.

The people here are Fadra, G'tive, and Kaelana.   
Obvious exits:
Main Entrance  Sands </b>
 
Standing as close as she can get to the hatching sands and still be in the galleries is Niklo, her gaze fixed on the eggs nestled in their own little hills of dark sand. The girl squints, as though that might help her see each one better, and murmurs under her breath, ""Right, now, that one's jus' gotta be a brown in there. An' that..."" an audible sigh, ""...Well, still ain't got no idea 'bout that one. But there's time. An' that...""

Fadra climbs the stairs silently; they're familiar, and her her booted footfalls make little noise as she all-but sneaks up the stairs, a redfriut in her hand. Propping herself against the railing, the brownrider bites into her snack and chews thoughtfully, listening to Niklo's ongoing commentary with silent amusement (but never a smile, oh no) before pushing away from her post and striding closer, making no effort to conceal her steps now: ""Care t'make a wager on that?""

Infelice emerges from *between*, looking around discerningly.
Infelice has arrived.

Not long after the brownrider ascends the stairs to the galleries, Kaelana trudges up to the seats with a brooding expression set clearly on her features. Raising her gaze from the floor to the seats, the sight of others elicits a frown and mumble from the girl, her stride halted. Pondering the best course of action briefly, Kae decides to sit near the back, away from the voices and people. The brooding expression soon returns, the girls thoughts elsewhere.

Infelice hums almost thoughfully as she appears from cold *between*, her winter cornfield hide picking up snowy glints from the strategically places glows. Peering about her as she hovers, the young one takes stock of the brooding, somnolent Aerianth and her clutch of eggs - and makes a smart decision to avoid them - making a beeline for the small group of gathered humans.

Niklo is far to engrossed in staring at the eggs and doing her best to determine what color dragonet waits within. Still oblivious, she bursts out, ""An' I'd bet two weeks chores that'un there's a gold!"" A little grin crosses her face, though it vanishes as she catches Fadra's footsteps and whirls to spot the brownrider. Instead of pleased, her expression becomes just a tad guilty, as though she shouldn't be so presumptuous as to make guesses of golds. ""Oh, uh, a wager?"" The girl blinks at the question. ""I dunno...""

Kamia climbs up some stairs into the seats.
Kamia has arrived.

Gob has arrived.

Infelice zips down, and backwings to land on the Gallery railing, rustling her wings closed, and chirruping softly. Blue eyes whirl lazily, giving all those assembled the once-over. Taking note of the arriving Gob, the young queen peers upward at him, whistling a light query.

Fadra snags another bite of her fruit, regarding Niklo with hard eyes, evaluating her closely. ""Eh...well. If'n y'think y'know so well t'bet two weeks chores on what's coming outta that there egg..."" and she points not at any one specific egg but at the entire sands, ""then you have nay any reason t'be...oh...tentative."" 

Dropping into the nearest seat, Fadra assumes a lazily bored position, one arm crooked over the back of the seat behind her, for easy eating of her fruit, the other stretched straight across the back of the seat on the other side.

Kamia slips in quietly, having worked to hunt down the secert of where Niklo was.

The darker mottled blue pops into the gallery area, chirruping his arrival. At the beckoning of the queen, Gob wings lazily over, playing coy.

Infelice is too young, and too wise, it seems, to play anything but who she is, for now. Gob is again invited to perch next to her with the gentlest of welcoming trills.

Kaelana remains inconspicuous, a faint tilt of her head towards the two by the edge the only indication of anything other then being utterly lost in thought. At the mention of 'wager', her head swivels ever so slightly to cast a watchful eye on the pair, attention perked.

Niklo only stiffens under the scrutinizing gaze, drawing herself up and pretending to be far more sure of herself than she really is. ""I ain't... ain't... tena-whatever,"" she replies, head high. ""I know fer a fact that that'un,"" a finger is pointed at the Thousand Burning Lamps Egg, ""has got gold. And,"" the girl adds daringly with a gesture to the Script Egg, ""that there, that's got a bronze."" Her shoulders square and she grins. ""Two weeks chores that both are right.""

""Mmm,"" Fadra says, flicking a piece of apple to the floor. ""Two weeks chores nay means much t'me."" A glance over her shoulder, and she catches Kaelana in the corner of her stare; it's just enough for the petite woman to mention, ""If'n y'want t'join th'conversation, do it. I nay take well t'eavesdroppers."" A pause before she adds, ""Don't y'agree, two weeks o'candidate chores means not much t'a brownrider?"" Another look at Niklo. ""After all...y'can nay do /rider/ chores without a dragon.""

Gob's interest is piqued, and he backwings just behind the railing. In a moment of suaveness, he reaches delicate talons out and just grasps the rail, a little click-clack noise and a repeat chirrup marking his arrival.

Kamia grins at Fadra. ""But she could do chores for you. Clean you weyr, do your mending, some other distasteful tasks?""

Infelice offers Gob a short croon, those wise eyes looking over the blue as if she might see within him. Her own silvery talons flex once upon the rail, securing her perch - her long tail also curled once about the thing.

Kaelana's head is raised in surprise, clearly not expecting to have been noticed. After the surprise fades, she drops her head with the return mumbled into her lap. Though any listening extra closely would catch what sounded like, ""more the reason...""

Niklo eases a tension she hadn't realized was there at the brownrider's words, barely managing to avoid breathing a sigh of relief. A small shrug. ""Chores're 'bout the best I can offer,"" the girl replies, ""Ain't got a full mark t'my name -- yet. Only got five eighths saved, an' yer bound to got more'an that, bein' a rider an' all..."" A funny expression crosses her face at Kamia's addition, but she just nods a Fadra. ""Guess yer right, bein' a rider an' all you gotta be real used to washin' yer dragon, runnin' errands, an' whatever, all yerself.""

Gob turns a slow circle on the rail, his wings extending to provide extra balance, showing his acrobatic skill to the young queen. He pauses when his more 'aesthetically imperfect' patterned side is in view, and he flutters his wing demonstratively.

Infelice appears...rather underwhelmed by the display Gob seems to be putting on for her. She politely watches for a few moments, yes - those blue, multi-faceted orbs following his gyrations with a little befuddlement - but her concentration is mostly given to other, new things around her. Like those eggs. *peeeer*

""It's never all yourself,"" Fadra says mildly - it's probably one of the few times she's ever mild. Maybe it has something to do with the apple. ""Y'always have a dragon t'help, or t'laugh at y'while y'work."" She shrugs, her eyebrow raising before she returns to speaking to Kaelana. ""What's that, Candidate? I can nay hear y'properly when y'mutter under your breath."" And it's not a question; it's a demand for repetition. ""Well, then...what d'ya get if'n y'win? Hmm?""

*""Well, then...what do I get if'n I win? Hmm?"" This back to Kaelana, with that same lazy glance passing her and going towards the firelizards.

Kamia is just watching now.

Gob completes his slow, careful circle and his wings sag deflatedly. Dejected, he deigns to refocus his whirling orbs on whatever that golden girl is studying...hm, eggs. He lifts off the railing, hovers, his gaze darting about to check for the dam's presence, then he dive bombs an egg.

Infelice is rather shocked to see Gob...attacking?! one of the eggs - and the golden firelizard lets out an ear-splitting shriek, which echos around the vaulted chamber. Her eyes whirl a speedy, uncertain yellow as she tosses herself into the air - giving Gob the harangue of his life.

Kaelana stands slowly to her feet, walking with purposeful steps down the rows of the galleries, her destination the pair by the edge. Stopping just short of Fadra, she turns up wide eyes at the brownrider, voice dripping with sweetness, ""Candidate."" She echoes, tone almost spitting out the word, ""Are we really as insignificant as you make it sound or should I start packing right now?""

Niklo begins to reply, thinks the better of it when Kaelana makes her way down, and falls silent. At the older girl's words she can't avoid cringing ever-so-slightly and looking away, suddenly very, very interested in the eggs on the sand. ""Oh... shards..."" the young candidate mumbles, biting her lip and bracing herself in case of a storm.

Gob pulls up short of the egg, winging a sharp and showy circle in the air and sets up a raucous chittering right back. Despite his visual derring-do, he retreats to a ledge above, where he keeps up the monologue.

Infelice ceases her upset barrage of sounds as soon as Gob breaks away from the egg, her eyes quickly returning to something closer to relaxed blue, though they still bear the occasional flecks of yellow. The little gold takes up her previous perch, but her eyes are cast upwards, keeping close watch on the nefarious Gob, still chittering away above.

Fadra is normally not as calm as she is right now - so, in a way, it's not really surprising what Fadra does. Her attention falls on Kaelana, who is now standing just in front of her, and now the smile that camps on her face is...annoyed. ""Candidate,"" she repeats. ""As in if'n y'want t'pack your bags, I'll help. Because if'n y'Impress...you'll think th'way I said that was praise compared t'the way they'll call y'/Weyrling/. I dare ya t'talk t'the weyrlingmaster staff like you just did me. If'n y'have things t'say, nay say them under your breath. That's cowardly."" A beat. ""Was there anything y'didn't understand that time? Anything else that needs clarification?"" She stands. ""Shall we go stuff you're belongings in a bag and move y'out? 'Twill only take a few moments, trust me; and then I'll have t'go report t'Griere that one o'our Candidates though t'twas appropriate for her to...remove herself...from th'honor o'standing.""

Kamia just stands there horrified, her jaw dropped.

Gob ceases his noise as Fadra's calm voice echoes forth, and he ducks his head beneath his wing, feigning sleep. His breathing is exaggerated, his whole chest puffing out, his head bobbling around on his lithe candywrapper neck.

Infelice is not fooled, not in a heartbeat. The vigilant little one watches Gob as if he had disturbed her own nest - but oddly without leftover anger. Just keeping track of the fiesty blue.

Clearly not one to be phased by any sort of verbal rebuttal, Kaelana actually tilts her head and puts her hands on her hips before replying, tone still saccharine, ""Maybe I wasn't muttering at all, you seem to have not heard my question. People seem to find the right way to treat their future is with disdain and it seems od that nobody has noticed that yet. You were a candidate, every person on a dragon right now -was- a candidate, so why treat us worse then the leftovers of the corrals after a flight?"" She pauses, her words having dropped the sweetness to be replaced by a slight vehemence, ""Thankfully since I live here, my stuffwont't have far to go, but since it'll make you think your threats actually have an effect on me, I think I'll be keeping my bags where they are."" And with that, she gives a small spin on the spot towards the exit, skirt dusting along the floor before she strides out of the galleries, giving no time for a reply.

Well, it went better than she'd hoped... but Niklo still remains quiet, hardly daring to breath lest she draw Fadra's attention to herself. Which isn't exactly what she's looking for at the moment. Instead she listens to Kaelana's reply with wide eyes, and then watches the older girl boldly walk away, hardly believing it. Part of her is, unfortunately, impressed, although the other part is horrified.

Fadra is too cool, too in control of herself to follow Kaelana. No bludgeoning candidates, no no no. Reassuming her lazy posture, she watches the girl go - though not without glaring daggers into her back. Luckily for all those involved, no real daggers come into play. A flick of the wrist sends the remainder of Fadra's apple skittering after Kaelana, with no intentions of actually making contact. Unluckily for Niklo, with Kaelana gone there's only the lizards and her to keep Fadra occupied. Guess which one our brownrider picks? ""So. About that wager.""

Kamia carefully starts to back away from the others, heading quietly for the stairs.

The little blue remains where he settled for a few moments, but upon Kaelana's exit, he wings toward the bowl, chittering over his shoulder, his head turned enough that he almost skims the wall in his haste.

Infelice gives a soft chirrup of satisfaction as Gob exits, her wings flicking primly to her sides as she makes sure he's well gone. Once she feels certain, the little gold relaxes once again, now peering over her shoulder at the duet of Fadra and Niklo.

By some miracle - or perhaps she just doesn't think fast enough to actually react - Niklo manages not to flinch away as Fadra turns on her. ""Wager,"" despite herself, she squeaks slightly as she says this, clears her throat, and tries again, ""Right, uh, wager. I thought... chores didn't mean much t'ya?""

Fadra flutters her fingers in a vague gesture. ""They don't,"" she concedes. ""So I ask again...if'n I win and you do two weeks o'extra chores...what do you get if'n you win?"" A short pause, in which she considers the departing blue firelizard and regards the remaining gold with a return peeer. ""I mean, 'tis nay a fair wager if'n y'nay /win/ anything.""

Kamia runs as soon as she's far enough away to not hear anything.

Infelice seems to find Fadra's peering almost hypnotic, somehow. The young gold rearranges her long frame with careful clicks of claws so that she's now facing the brownrider - unabashedly staring into the woman's eyes. *peeeer* Is it curiosity, hunger, or pure stubbornness?

Niklo's curiousity gets the better of her, and her fear of the brownrider dissapates for the moment. She shrugs. ""I dunno, mebbe... an even trade? I do two weeks chores if I lose, you... uh, you do two weeks chores if you lose?"" A lopsided grin for a moment, but she catches herself and inquires, ""But... why ask if it don't matter?""

Fadra gives another vague gesture, this one even more so than the first if only because Fadra's engaged in a staring contest of titanic proportions. ""What're y'staring at?"" she wants to know of Infelice, though obviously without expecting any sort of answer beyond a chirp. If that. Instead, she lets her glance flick away, for two whole seconds, to regard Niklo and make sure she's not attempting to flee. It will not do to terrorize all company away. ""I can nay do two weeks o'your chores. I've got watchrider duty, 'n' messenger duty. Your things need t'be done before I'm even through with m'own chores."" She hmms thoughtfully. ""How many marks did y'say y'had?""

Infelice doesn't chirp, but instead trills softly to Fadra's 'staring contest,' her young form mince-stepping a little more forward on the thick rail to bring her a little closer to the brownrider. *peeeeer?* Seems she's at least curious, especially from the way her head quirks to one side.

Niklo sighs at the truth of the brownrider's words, giving a small nod. ""Y'got a point,"" she agrees, and makes a face. ""Not even a whole mark. Jus'..."" A pause as she does some figuring in her head, and then replies, ""Well, got 'bout five eighths, an' another three 'fore the hatchin'. Hopefully I'll get a whole'un by then, though I dunno if it'll do me much good to bet with by then."" The girl sighs. ""So, five eighth-marks.""

Fadra's brows go up, in an affected expression that belongs to one who doesn't deal with children or animals often or well. It fits her face perfectly. ""Whaaaat."" That's to Infelice, and if she backs down a little at the little queen's approach, well...so be it. ""What d'ya want? Hmm? I nay have any food. Are y'bored? I mean, I've got three lizards that'll keep y'company. Okay, well..maybe nay Oracle, she's a bit of a twit, but th'others..."" To Niklo: ""Well...what say you t'this. If'n I win, y'get two weeks o'chores; if'n you win, I'll give y'whatever finishes up your mark, and then another whole. Sound fair?"" Maybe she's not all bad? Perhaps her demon has a passionate side. Or maybe Sully is speaking through her.

Infelice now quirk her head to the other side as Fadra addresses her, clearly concentrating on the woman. A low thrum from the gols expanding chest, and she suddenly takes to the air, to cheep almost aplogetically...and tries to land on the woman's shoulder.

The young candidate can't help but grin at the little gold, despite her attempts of late to pretend she doesn't like them. But when Fadra mentions having three of her own, the girl can't help but sigh wistfully. ""Oh... three? An' I can't even get one..."" Niklo says softly, but shakes her head as if to clear it from those worries. Instead she focuses on the brownrider's words, and blinks, surprised. ""...Really?"" She clears her throat. ""I-I mean, sure! Er, rather, um... ah, yer on!"" The girl can't help but grin a little.

With three, it's not hard to guess that there's padding in the shoulder; still, Fadra ducks slightly when Infelice takes flight and tries to land on her shoulder. And land she does, which gives Fadra the perfect vantage point for a sidelong LOOK. ""I'm nay your friend,"" she warns. ""I'm nay even /friendly/ and y'need t'be friendly t'have friends. So. Don't think this'll be a regular occurance."" And that's that; Fadra doesn't shoo Infelice away, but instead shifts just so she's comfortable too. Even small, they're big. ""Y'don't want one,"" she says t'Niklo. ""If'n y'don't believe me, I'll make Tod pester you. He's part o'her clutch."" A jerk of the thumb in Infelice's general direction. ""You'll be payin' me t'take him back."" Now, though, a wager made, Fadra leans forward, looking towards the eggs and saying, ""Now, which is gold and which is bronze. If'n e'en one hatches that colour, 'twill be your win.""

Infelice feels the love in the air, as it were, and cheeps brightly over at Niklo as the girl focuses on her. But then, she's back to business: At Fadra's own 'look,' the tip of her nose touches the woman's own nose as she again peeers at the brownrider. And then she slowly lifts her neck and head away, to stare pointedly out at Aerianth's eggs. And then back to staring at Fadra again.

Niklo smiles faintly at Fadra's suggestion that firelizards are as pesty as everyone says, but she doesn't reply - she is, after all, not supposed to like them anymore. As if remembering her new stance on the little creatures she purposefully ignores the gold now on the brownrider's shoulder and points. ""That bright'un, there,"" the girl points to the yellow-gold egg that's hard to miss in the dark sand, ""I say it's gotta be a gold. I mean... jus' lookit. An' that, the one that looks kinda like some'un scrawled all over? S'gotta be bronze."" Sage nod.

Fadra is also very deliberatly attempting to ignore Infelice. It must be easier for Niklo; every few seconds Fadra's eyes dart to the gold perched on her, but only long enough to confirm there is no imagination involved in the weight on her shoulder. She instead is peeking at the eggs more, regarding them seriously. ""P'raps...p'raps. I can see where you'd see that...but I personally think, that one there is going t'be a brown."" This of the scrawled egg. ""It's too grand t'be anything else.""

Infelice appears patient in her attempts to try and communicate with Fadra. A point out the the eggs, and a point back to Fadra. Point-point. Get the point? It must be important to the wee gold, since she's keeping to it.

The girl considers, tipping her head to one side for a moment, then nods. ""Yeh, I guess I could see a brown too,"" she agrees at last. ""But I still say it's bronze. Too many others I think're like to be a brown. An' they can't all be brown!"" Even as she says this she can't help but notice the gold firelizard's actions and looks at first Infelice, then the eggs, and then back - but she promptly remembers she's supposed to be ignoring the 'lizard, and stops trying to figure it out.

Fadra doesn't speak firelizard. Or sign language. Or lizard sign. She's barely good at communication with people of her own species. Hear the accent? Understand what she's saying? So, when she finally turns to Infelice, her expression is long-suffering. ""What?"" She points out towards the eggs herself, saying, ""What about them? Hmm? Whaa? You're going t'jerk your head outta th'socket, I'm warnin'."" -- ""O'course they can nay all be brown. 'Twould be the perfect clutch; we can nay have perfection, or th'world will tear itself apart at the seams.""

Infelice gives a frustrated little cheep at Fadra's thickheadedness, and suddenly launches herself from the woman's shoulder, once again taking to the air above the dragon clutch. Swirl-spiral-circle she goes, around and around the large eggs, giving a worried whistle. For a few moments, she darts outside the 'Grounds, and soon enough zips back in...another worried whistle applied.

Niklo just grins at the brownrider's obvious bias, then shrugs. ""Well, dunno if it'd be perfect..."" she begins carefully, ""But it'd be a good clutch. Browns've got the best of both types, when y'lookit the other colors. They got decent agility an' they got the stayin' ability. "" The girl nods. ""I'd not be bad a'tall."" And then, completely breaking her attempt to ignore Infelice, she watches the gold launch itself from Fadra's shoulder and then flit about. ""...I don't... get it,"" the girl says, looking to the woman. ""...D'you?""

Fadra is, for once, short winded. Shaking her head slowly, she says, ""Nope. Nay one bit.""

Infelice is rather beside herself for so young a creature. Her worry-whistles and flutterings continue for another minute, as do her zips in and out of the 'Grounds. And finally, a little tired and at her wits end, the wee gold again perches on the railing - her chest expanding hugely, breathing in and out deeply as she stares out at those eggs...her eyes yellow-flecked blue.

Niklo grows more concerned as she watches the poor gold, so obviously distressed. As her concern mounts, her conviction to pretending she no longer likes firelizards is forgotten. ""Wh... what's wron?"" the girl asks, stepping forward to get a better look at where the little creature's looking, ""Is somethin' wrong with the eggs, or what?""

Fadra's own concern is better concealed; she lets Niklo do the talking, though she doesn't lean back into her seat again. Instead, she stands and walks towards the railing, leaning against it and glancing towards Infelice. ""Okay, so. Eggs. Got that. What else. Cause, if'n you're just trying to show us they're there....we knew.""

Infelice again whistles low, this time to Niklo, fluttering those diaphanous wings lightly, and then peering...up? And if one cares to look, the wee gold is seen to peer up in the general direction where Gob once perched. Up on that ledge. And then peering down at the eggs again.

Niklo blinks, following the gold's gaze as she looks upward. A skeptical look crosses her face. ""Um... it's gonna rain?"" she guesses, looking back at Fadra for help. Going with that idea, however, she turns to face Infelice again and shakes her head. ""Don't worry, a lil' rain won't hurt the eggs. S'why they're smooth, see? Water jus' slides right off.""

Fadra's eyes go upward. ""I'm nay going up there."" That's her two marks.

Infelice cannae take annahmore, you thick-headed, addle boobies of humans! With a screech of patience brought to its utter end, the little gold makes one last circut around the eggs, then flits out of the Grounds...this time for good.

Infelice flits down from the galleries towards the entrance.
Infelice has left.

Niklo watches the gold fly off, blinks, then shrugs. ""Mebbe it'll rain?"" she questions, wrinkling her nose. ""Weird lil' bugger... are they all like that?"" The girl shakes her head and looks back towards the eggs on the sands. ""I do hope nothin' s'wrong with 'em, though...""

Fadra watches Infelice go with a confused blink after her. ""Hmmm...I'm going t'go...get Griere, I think. If'n there is something with th'eggs...y'know."" She shrugs and before leaving, turns to say, ""Nay forget our bet."" And then she's disappearing down the stairs.

Fadra walks down the stairs towards the entrance.
Fadra has left.

<b>Candidates' Quarters(#1299RAJs$)

The barracks of Ista Weyr are crowded almost Turn round with the Candidates for its queens' Hatching. Cots line both walls and even the space in between. All the cots have a small press at the foot of them for Candidates' few belongings.
You see several Candidates getting ready for the evening chores and meal.

A curtain leads out into the east cavern.
Contents:
Kaelana
Brighid
Candidate Cot Chart
Obvious exits:
East Cavern  </b>

Candidate she may be, but old habits die hard. Even if they're supposedly hated chores. Sitting cross-legged on her bunk in the back corner of the candidate's quarters is Niklo, a partially completed basket in her lap. Beside her is a cloth with what appears to be her dinner, a slice of bread, a chunk of cheese, and a redfruit -- all of which is untouched. In another basket, finished and obviously waterproofed somehow, is whatever's being used to make the basket, soaking in water.

Brighid enters, a fair sized satchel slung over her left shoulder and a tiny blue firelizard perched on the other, tail wraped around her neck as the hatchling balances. She scans the room breifly, smiling in silent greeting, before carelessly tossing her belongings on an empty cot near the other two girls, ""Hi there."" No shyness in this girl.

Niklo is used to people coming and going and all the while paying little or no attention to her, so when Brighid enters she doesn't so much as look up from her work. Though today the basket she's set on completing is a bit trickier than her usual fare, being a loose but complex weave that's easily more for decoration than practical use. Her food lays thoroughly forgotten beside her.

Kaelana, however, isn't immersed quite enough into her journal to avoid the greeting given. She shuts the book with a small snap before raising her gaze to the new girl. Without a look or care, the book is absently lobbed into the open press as Kae regards the newest member of this cavern with interest. With upturned lips, she replies, ""Hey there! I don't think I've seen you here before...new?""

Brighid nods and scritches Neilan under the chin, ""Just came in earlier today. M'duk and Draeth asked me to stand."" A bright smile gracesher features, ""I'm Brighid. R'mal's sister."" She leaves her things on the cot, the firelizard swaying and almost loosing his balance as she moves a little too quickly, and walks over to stand a little ways away from Niklo, ""Not hungry?"" She looks at the basket curiously, ""That's really pretty.""
Brighid pages to Kaelana and Niklo: Danged 'a' key. That was supposed to be R'mel.

Niklo can't really pretend the other girl's not there when she's talking right to her. Doesn't mean she's gotta look up, though! ""Busy,"" the weaver-girl mutters, fingers not so much as slowing as she twists and turns, loops and tightens the strands that are slowly building up the basket. A shrug to the pretty comment. ""Guess it is."" Very, very carefully she avoids looking at the firelizard on the other girl's shoulder.

Buccaneer climbs down from Kaelana's cot.
Buccaneer has arrived.

Noticing the small blue on the other girl's shoulder, Kaelana gives a low 'ohh' and asks, tone polite, ""Did you get him at that hatching the Weyrleader had at the beach? I left early 'cause I don't want another little 'lizard."" At her mention of her own one, Buc pokes his head out from her light blanket he was so recently sleeping in and blinks slowly, regarding the little one with interest.

Brighid shrugs and turns to go back to her cot. Neilan, however, peers at the weaver and her work in progress. At Kaelana's question, the girl grins and nods, ""Uh huh. I think I probably came out after you'd left."" She reaches up to give the little blue a scritch, earning a contented warble as he leans into her hand.

Only when the other girl turns away does Niklo stop weaving, laying her basket aside and wiping her nose with the back of her hand. A quiet sniffle, which she attempts to stifle, and she quickly wraps the half-finished basket and puts that, along with the one soaking her materials, under her cot. Her food is wrapped up and put there as well, and she flops onto her side, carefully facing away from the two girls.

Kaelana looks from one girl to the other, brow raised with little understanding of the current situation. She gives a small shrug before reaching into her press and retrieving the journel, propping it open in her lap yet again. She gives Buc a little poke and he returns to the blanket, his curiosity sated. As before Kaelana begins scribbling furiously again, writing what? Nobody knows.

Brighid glances over at Niklo at the sniffle, concern writ plain on her face, ""Are you okay?"" No thought apparently given as to whether or not the other girl would want to talk.

Her voice thick with effort it takes not to cry, Niklo manages to get out a snappish, ""Why d'you care?"" that's tinged with both anger, and doesn't roll over to face the other girl. ""J-jus'... jus go 'way.""

Neilan croons softly, leaning far toward the other girl, as Brighid blinks, taken aback, ""But why wouldn't I care? Aren't we supposed to look out for each other as candidates?"" The girl seems utterly confused.

Niklo somehow manages to match Brighid's confusion with her own frustration and anger, despite the other girl having nothing -- or very little to do with it. In one quick motion she rolls and sits up, face in the blonde candidate's face. Her eyes are red and shiny with tears that she refuses to let fall. ""Get *that* 'way from me!"" A short nod to the 'lizard on Brighid's shoulder. ""Now.""

Brighid blinks, her eyes wide with shock as her hand goes to the little blue now trying to hide behind her neck, ""What's wrong with Neilan?"" She is utterly confused as she disengages the 'lizard's tail from around her neck and tucks him into the crook of her arm, comforting them both.

""Everythin'!"" Niklo snaps, sitting back on her cot so she's no longer in the other candidate's face. Looking at the back wall she snorts softly and then adds, ""I... don't like... firelizards."" One can almost see her jaw set. ""They're nothin' but stupid, annoyin' lil' pests. So,"" she looks back to Brighid and glares, ""you'd better keep that thing 'way from me.""

Neilan hides his head in the crook of Brighid's arm, chirring quietly and almost sounding like he is weeping. The girl still looks taken aback and confused as she gently strokes the little blue's back, ""No they're not. They may not be as smart as dragons, but they're not stupid."" She makes small shushing noises at the hatchling and rocks him gently, ""I'll do my best to keep him away, but I still don't understand.""
                   
Niklo smiles, but it's a bitter one. ""Fine then, they ain't stupid. Feel better?"" Her expression holds, though only because it's pasted on, and her eyes are cold. ""They're still pests,"" she adds, ""An' you can't deny that. Annoyin' lil' pests. Clear 'nuff?"" Near the end of this, however, the younger girl's voice breaks and she turns away, face in hands. Yet still she makes no sound, so if she's actually crying it's hard to say.

Brighid shakes her head in confusion and mutters just barely audibly, ""They're only pests if they haven't been trained properly..."" She does, however, take Neilan to the cot she's claimed and deposit him on the pillow with a firm command to stay. As though to proove Niklo's point, though, the blue just can't seem to mind and is soon perched on a cot not far from the weaver. Brighid doesn't notice as she is already back there and sitting on the edge of an empty cot, ""Why don't you like firelizards? Aside from the fact that they're pests."" As bad as a canine after a bone, she is.

Jascela pages: Then a bigger ring to wear in private, if she's with a partner who appreciates it. :)
Carefully keeping her face from being seen, Niklo laughs at the other girl's question. ""Funny you should ask somethin' like that..."" she says slowly, her voice low. ""Real funny."" A short, barking laugh escapes her and her then she croaks out, ""I don't dislike 'em. I love 'em. Or,"" her voice goes cold again, ""I did.""
Long distance to Jascela: Niklo nodnods.

Brighid now looks more confused than ever, ""What happened? Why don't you like them any more?"" She doesn't seem to see anything funny about her questions. Neilan continues his creeping up on his friend until, unnoticed by Brighid, he is sitting on the cot beside her.

Niklo's voice retains its coldness as she replies with, ""S'called 'disappointment' and 'losin' hope'. Both real good reason's to not like 'em anymore."" The girl turns to face Brighid, and surprisingly her face is neither tear-streaked nor red as one might expect had she been crying. Instead it's almost expressionless -- all that can be recognized is something far too old to be seen on so young a face. She waves a hand dismissively. ""Ever wanted somethin', but time after time couldn't get it? So ya finally jus' decided to stop gettin' yer hopes up an' hate it, to make it easier?""

Brighid blinks and shakes her head, a look of pitty in her eyes, ""No I can't say that I have..."" She looks down at her hands folded in her lap, ""I'm sorry you feel that way..."" She's suddenly very meek at the though of such dissapointment.

The hand that had been waved a moment ago hits the cot, and hard. ""Don't!"" Niklo snaps, getting to her feet. ""Don't go feelin' all sorry, or pityin' me!"" The girl shakes her head, sending strands of her dreadlocked hair flying. ""Ain't gonna help anythin', ain't gonna make you or me or anybody feel better! Jus' wasted energy. Go... go 'way an' play with yer stupid 'lizard. Leave me alone.""

Brighid again looks taken aback and looks down at Neilan as the little blue chirups, ""Sorry to bother you."" She scoops the 'lizard up and stands, giving up on trying to be friends with Niklo right away and walking back over to the cot she's claimed. The hatching is again deposited on the pillow and the girl begins unpacking the satchel and stowing her things in the press.

Niklo lets out a 'hmph' at the other girl's apology and plops down on her cot once more, facing away from the rest of the room and crossing her arms. Eventually she lays down and buries her face in her pillow, but en then she remains quiet, only her body shaking slightly to give hint to what she might be doing.

Brighid looks over at the other girl every few minutes, concern in her eyes with each glance. Only half finished unpacking, she flops down on the cot and scoops Neilan up, whispering to him and cuddling the blue, an almost sad look on her face as she loves on the 'lizard. Neilan, meanwhile, seems to be thuroughly enjoying the attention and rubs his head against his friend's cheek, crooning happily all the while.

Niklo keeps her face burried in her pillow, arms over her head and covering her ears so she can totally block out the rest of the candidates as they trickle in settle themselves for the night. And to their credit, no one comes to bother her or ask if she's well. Which is probably, in the end, all the better.

Brighid firmly puts Neilan on the pillow again and makes her way back over to Niklo, and, amazingly, this time the little blue stays where he's put. The girl clears her throat, ""I know it's not much consolation, but I'm sure you'll Impress a firelizard someday."" And with that she goes to finish unpacking.

While Brighid is near the younger girl doesn't so much as twitch, remaining completely still and silent until she's alone once again. Then she lifts her head and sniffles, wiping her nose with the back of her arm. ""Right,"" she whispers to herself hopelessly, ""An' I'll live to see Thread fall again..."" Shaking her head, she reaches under her cot and pulls out her food, taking the chunk of cheese from it and chewing absently on it.

Brighid looks over at the other girl and shakes her head a little as she refolds a tunic and carelessly crams the garment into a corner of the press.

<b>Candidates' Quarters(#1299RAJs$)

The barracks of Ista Weyr are crowded almost Turn round with the Candidates for its queens' Hatching. Cots line both walls and even the space in between. All the cots have a small press at the foot of them for Candidates' few belongings.
As it's the day hours, only a few Candidates can be seen here.

A curtain leads out into the east cavern.
Contents:
Illatus
Candidate Cot Chart
Obvious exits:
East Cavern  </b>

Illatus sits on his cot, near the door to the baracks, staring at the half-written letter infront of him and frowning, unable to think of what more to say. With a roar of irritation, he slams the writing pad down on his cot and stands up, bounding across the candidate quarters. ""Sharding letters,"" he mutters.

By herself in the corner is the bunk that Niklo has claimed, and at the moment the girl is kneeling by the press that accompanies it, with her meager possessions spread out before her. ""Lesse,"" the girl mumbles to herself, sorting through things as she puts them one by one back into the press. ""Didn't forget anythin'? Don't think so..."" With other candidates coming and going, she doesn't bother looking up every time someone moves, and therefore doesn't notice Illatus.

Illatus's swearing rampage calms and he glances around the quarters, he'd thought it empty for the time of day, but he sees Niklo kneeling by her press and shouts over to the girl, ""Sorry, Niklo,"" and groaning. ""You got the day off too?""

Hearing her name, Niklo looks up to see who called it. It's not a difficult feat -- there may well be people in and out all day long, but most don't stay, so it's easy to spot Illatus. ""Oh,"" the girl calls back, ""It was you makin' all the racket, then? Didn't know one person could be so loud!"" She grins, but it doesn't last long. ""Got today off... only 'cuz I've been doin' more than my share. Stay away from Nolee, if you can work it!""

Illatus grins and nods, ""So far I've managed to do just that,"" he says, lazily making his way across the candidate barracks towards the young girl. ""I haven't actually had a single conversation with Nolee yet, so I think I'm doin' well enough."" He winks. ""Managed to avoid a duty on my first day as a candidate, gotta be a good omen to how the rest of candidacy will be, surely?""

Niklo groans, gathering up what's still on the floor and pushing it under her cot for now. ""Better not be an omen,"" she replies, making a face. ""I got dragged into candidate work 'fore I even got Searched!"" Sighing, she plops down on the cot and grumbles, ""Mebbe I'll get lucky an' it'll switch our luck, eh?""

Illatus frowns slightly in confusion, ""How'd that work out?"" he asks, tilting his head at Niklo and grinning at his fellow candidate. ""Shells, I sure hope not, I like my time off. M'duk told me I'd get very little of it, maybe this is his idea of a practical joke, putting me into a false sense of security with the chores.

Niklo gives the boy a wry grin. ""Nolee."" Her reply to his question is short and sweet. ""Like I said, you value yer free time, keep away from her! She's real nice, but she'll rope ya into work soon's she sees ya. I wasn't even a candidate -- yet -- an' she got me workin' with 'em!"" The girl tries to frown, but can't through her grinning. ""She's havin' way too much fun bein' in charge...""

Illatus nods for a moment, and shrugs, ""I guess that it's good practice for a gold rider to boss people about, get us used to following her orders now, and then whichever ones of us actually impress with have it ingrained into our personalities by then."" He smiles at Niklo, ""How'd your uncle take to you not being able to just work on his baskets anymore?"" he asks.

Raising an eyebrow at Illatus and his reasoning, the girl just rolls her eyes. ""Naw,"" she says with a small grin, ""she just don't like doin' work. Of any kind. Bein' able to tell the, uh, us candiates--"" her expression goes funny as she remembers she's one too, ""--what do to do is her cup o' tea. Anything she don't wanna do, we do for her! Which... is everythin'."" A full-blown grin.

Illatus frowns again, ""Surely she doesn't fob everything off on us, I mean - delegating all those tasks must be some amount of work on it's own,"" he says, looking slightly confused as he perches on the end of an unused cot near Niklo, ""There's only so much she can have us do, really - and there aren't that many of us yet.""

Niklo laughs, but shakes her head and shrugs a little. ""I dunno,"" the girl says, ""But don't seem like that much work to just call any candidates nearby over to... say, sort out ropes or somethin'."" She tries not to grin again, but it's a losing battle and she only manages to add, ""The fewer of us there are, the more work for each of us. An' trust me, she'll find stuff she don't wanna do. Easy."" Then she has to turn away.

Illatus nods to Niklo, sighing, ""I guess you're right - you'll know a lot more about it, of course, I only got searched yesterday and haven't had to do much work since then. Has been nice having a day off from the kitchens, but I'll probably be assigned to help out there with chores, knowing my luck. And they always make the candidates work harder. I know! I was told to make sure they did by one of the aunties,"" he groans.

""Naw, not a lot more,"" Niklo shakes her head, ""Jus' sayin' what I've seen, though. 'Course,"" she goes on, expression going odd, ""It does figure, don't it? I was bein' all smug 'bout not bein' a candidate and gettin' outta all that work. Then, I get dragged into it anyway. And then,"" the girl grins, ""I get Searched right after! Faranth, next time I'll be more carefu!"" She sounds quite positive she'll escape this time.

Illatus chuckles, ""Yeh, life works little tricks on you now and then, doesn't it?"" he says, stretching out his legs and stifling a yawn with the back of his hand. ""Anyway, I'm glad you're a candidate, Niklo, means I'm not the youngest,"" he says with an impish grin. ""All the others seem much older than me, t'be honest.""

Niklo smiles at this, nodding a little. ""I know the feelin',"" she agrees, sighing. ""An' part of me wishes I'd said no. At the time it seemed like a good idea, with three dragons starin' at me, but now..."" The girl shakes her head and looks away, ""When I don't Impress I'm never gonna hear the end of it from Brother. An' I already know he's gonna come watch.""

Illatus lifts an eyebrow, ""When you -don't- impress?"" he asks, ""Surely you've got as much chance as anyone... and three dragons searched you? That's gotta put the odds on you slimmer, hasn't it? Not that I claim to know a whole lot about betting, but, y'know,"" the boy shrugs and smiles at his fellow candidate.

A small laugh. ""Never said t'was three dragons!"" the girl exclaims, amused. ""One was Nalaieth, Nolee's gold. She was just there. But Draeth and Riaceth were both interested in me, for some reason."" Niklo shrugs. ""But I ain't gonna Impress, I'm sure of it. Not me. 'Sides, I dunno if I even wanna dragon!""

Illatus frowns, ""Isn't the more relevant aspect whether a dragon wants -you-, and not the other way around?"" he asks, ""And why wouldn't you want a dragon? Get all the benefits without the hassle of threadfall that most of 'em have to go through."" He smiles, ""Sounds like a rather sweet cup of klah to me.""

Niklo considers that and sighs, realizing the truth in what Illatus says. ""Guess I didn't think of it that way..."" she mutters, nodding. ""But dragons are a lot of work! An'... an' they make ya crazy. Ain't you never noticed how all riders are so crazy? S'cuz of the dragons."" She nods sagely. ""That wouldn't change, even without Thread around.""

Illatus frowns and nods slightly, ""Yeh, actually, most of the riders I've met do seem a little... unbalanced,"" he says, ""But I think that's probably because most of the riders I've met have been drunk."" He shrugs and grins at Niklo. ""Maybe you're right though, I don't know to be honest.""

Niklo can't help but laugh, telling the boy, ""You really need to get out more."" She grins, shakes her head slowly, and then questions, ""Ever seen 'em go all... glazed over and far-off? They're talkin' to their dragons in their heads, somehow. An' the dragons kinda take over the way they feel an' act, too. You've seen flights, right?"" A shudder. ""I'd rather act the way I wanna act, without some voice in my head.""

Illatus raises an eyebrow at Niklo, ""I get out plenty, thanks very much,"" he says, frowning slightly. ""I've seen flights, yeh, but from what most riders I've talked to about it says, they're one of the most fun things having a dragon does for them. And it might be nice to have a voice in your head, y'know. You'd never get lonely and such.""

Opening her mouth to say something, the girl seems to think the better and closes it again, just smirking instead. ""I'll jus'... take yer word for it."" More smirking. ""But like I said, I'd rather have control over myself. How I act, feel, an' 'specially think."" Niklo makes a face. ""Which means no talkin' to voices in my head. If I get lonely, I'll go into the livin' cavern! There's always some'un there.""

Illatus nods and shrugs, ""Yeh, but in the living cavern you get some crazy people, and they're not always riders. Some of 'em are just weird."" He shrugs, ""Weird in a scary way."" He smiles at Niklo and stands from his perch on the cot, ""Anyway, I'm gonna go for some dinner,"" he says, smiling, ""See y'around. Enjoy the rest of your day off.""

Niklo shrugs. ""Weird as they are, 'least they ain't in my head!"" she replies, shuddering. But then the boy's getting up to leave and she nods, grinning. ""See ya later!"" is called after him, ""Watch out for weirdos!"" Then she's on the floor again, pulling her things from under the bunk to finish sorting.

Illatus grins and leaves the candidate barracks, a lazy wave of his hand being his farewell to Niklo.
Illatus pushes aside the curtain across the exit to go out into the east cavern.
Illatus has left.

<b>Ista Weyr Living Cavern(#1100RJMs$)
The cavern is filled with people, rider and nonrider alike for the evening meal. The reddish glow of the setting sun filters in through the large bowl entrance to the northwestern wall. Through the constant movement of drudges to and from the northern side of the wall, you can see the four large hearths there, each put to the task of cooking the large Weyr meals. An occasional drudge filters in and out of the entrance to the Lower Caverns entrance on the western side of the room. New riders and others are still filtering in through this entrance as well, leading out to the rest of the lower caverns.
Several huge tapestries, many of them ancient, are hanging on the stone walls. One particularly glorious one looks to be a study on the finger rock. You also see several 'places' to sit.

Two people enter the living cavern; the first a tall-ish man in his mid to late 20's, giving the place a skeptical once-over and the second a girl of about twelve turns, looking more than slightly upset. Of the pair it's the latter who belongs at Ista, while the former is merely visiting -- and it's a good thing as well, since he looks less than impressed with the accomadations the place has to offer. ""I'm sitting,"" he grunts at last to the girl a few steps behind him, ""Get me something to eat, right?"" Sighing quite loudly the girl complies, moving away to do as asked. Or ordered.

A plate of food and some quiet solitude are but a few of the things to make a nice meal and Kaelana happens to be taking advantage of both, nibbling slowly in one of the quieter corners. She still seems interested in the going's ons within the caverns however, and her gaze surveys the room restlessly. A slow sip of juice is taken before she returns to her seemingly purposeless vigil.

Balinne walks in from the bowl.
Balinne has arrived.

Carelessly piling two plates with food, the girl picks them up and then scans the room in search of the man she entered with. It takes a moment or two, as though she's not completely used to picking him out of a crowd, but she finally spots him and makes her way over, dropping a plate loudly in front of him. ""There,"" Niklo tells him in a very low, emotionless tone. ""Eat up."" She then puts her own plate down and sits, picking at her food and looking around the cavern -- anywhere but at the man stitting across from her.

Balinne walks outside, into the bowl.
Balinne has left.

Kaelana's somewhat nosy listening to all those about seems to be a positive thing in this case, the girl noticing Niklo's current plight. A slow bite of *something* is eaten before a small wave is given, to be accepted or declined at will. She doesn't look overly concerned at the other girls predicament but still throws a smile along with the silent invitation.

Nolee has arrived.

The wave and smile that Kaelana offers might, in most cases, have been missed by Niklo if she hadn't been frantically trying to find something else in the cavern to look at. As it is, however, she manages to catch both and quickly excuses herself with nothing more than a grunt of irritation from her former 'company'. Picking up her plate, she moves to where the other girl is sitting and manages to grin lopsidedly. ""Heya. Uh, mind if I sit 'ere?""

The commotion near Niklo is enough to draw Nolee's attention, and the brown-eyed woman looks up from a rather scrabbly-looking set of hides spread before her on the table to blink curiously at cavern's inhabitants, her gaze holding momentarily on the strange thing Kaelana's eating before noting Niklo's arrival. Abandoning her hides, Nolee scoots Kaelana's way. ""Me, too?""

Looking between the two recent arrivals to her so recently empty table. The young girl was expected, the weyrwoman was not. ""I...umm, Sure!"" She greets the arivees with a pleasent nod and grin, taking another bite of her dinner. She adds with a little chuckle, ""S'not my table, eh? It'd be nice to have some company, too much silence starts to get to ya.""

It's not just Kaelana who's surprised by the appearance of the junior weyrwoman herself. Niklo, too, is surprised to see Nolee and she makes it very obvious by the way her jaw draps and her eyes widen. She quickly collects herself again, though, and grins. ""'Ello,"" she greets the young woman, giving her a polite nod as she plops down in a nearby chair. A quick, ""Thanks,"" to Kaelana and she settles down to pick at her plate of food.

Nolee shrugs happily as she pulls up a chair and plops unceremoniously into it. ""That's for sure. Too much noise does too, though."" She glances at Niklo's former companion, then nods and smiles brightly, not at all aware of any discomfort her job title might cause. ""Ugh, hides are smelly,"" dismisses them. ""Wouldn't that be funny? If tables had names on them? Or better yet, if chairs did. You could search all mealtime long for the right one.""

Kaelana's not one to be surprised by anything for long, but even she'd look dumbfounded at the weyrwomans comments. After a moment, however, she manages to clear her face to a more friendly smile, responding with, ""They are? I agree?"" She looks confused, though this isn't an abnormal look for her, ""It would be funny! Nobody would follow it though, probably just be a novelty for a coupla seven-days then everyone would forget."" She adds, as a quiet aside to Niklo, ""No problem, It's nice to know my company is valued over at least one other person.""

Niklo has a nice pile of some sort of nuts, or seeds on her plate and is crunching away at them while the other two converse. Then she swallows and pipes up in agreement with Kaelana, ""I wouldn't bother with names, I sit wherever I wanna!"" The girl makes a rather wicked face, something between a grin and a smirk, ""I'd take whatever seat I want, an' if anybody didn't like it they'd have to kick me off it!"" She grins, then shrugs at the last comment made, ""Brother. He's visitin', to see the eggs on the sands. Trust me, nobody'd want near 'im.""

Nolee looks around the room absently before returning her focus to the group. ""The old ones are, like those. They smell musty."" She points at the abandoned ones. ""Sometimes it seems like there are specific tables for certain wings or for candidates or things, but every time the Wingleaders switch around, people do forget. Which is good for me because I'd never remember."" The gossop catches her ear, however. ""Why not? Does he,"" she leans over, ""smell?""

""I just sit where Iwanna too it seems,"" Kaelana nods in agreement, ""But thats mainly 'cause I come here for dinner later then most...so it's usually pretty empty."" She lets out a silent giggle at Nolee's remark, quickly rearranging her face into a serious expression, ""I sure hope he doesn't?"" is as much asked as stated. ""I'll stay away from 'im then, thank you very much!""

Niklo can't help but make a face, trying to to laugh at Nolee's question. ""He don't smell... but he's pretty rotten."" She winks at the weyrwoman, then pops a few more of whatever she's eating in her mouth, crunching away. ""Sendin' me off do do whatever he says to do, like I'm his personal servant or somethin'. I don't owe him nothin'!"" The girl takes a deep breath, grumbling, but shakes it off visibly fairly fast. A not at Kaelana. ""Eatin' at odd times sure's got persk, eh?""

Nolee joins in the soft giggle, bemused at the idea of arranged seating and of smelly brothers. ""There's scented soaps you could use...maybe they could help freshen up his inside, too. Hm. Later than most,"" she repeats, her brows furrowing. ""Jays. I think the things I'm working on are due. Somewhere. I should probably finish them."" She rises and cursties awkwardly and foolishly, then thanks them for their company and for, ""The respite from the smelly hides,"" before heading back to collect them and to bustle out of the cavern.

Kaelana opens and closes her mouth a few times, thinking of something to say as the weyrwoman dashes off, before turning to the other girl and asking at her sweetest, ""Was it something we said?"" In response to her own question a high laugh is given and she adds, ""It does. I'm out for most of the day with the fishing fleet so when we get back the cavern is almost empty. Sometimes the food is a bit cold though..."" She tactfully avoids the issue with Niklo's brother however.

As the junior weyrwoman hurries off Niklo gets to chance to say any sort of farewell, though this doesn't seem to phase her in the least. She just laughs at Kaelana's response and shakes her head. ""A bit... flightier than I would've thought a goldrider'd be,"" the girl comments with painful bluntness, ""but real nice."" A smile, then she tips her head to one side. ""Oh,"" she asks, looking impressed at the other girl's explanation of why she often eats late, ""You actually sail?""

Kaelana nods briskly, grinning happily, ""I sail most days unless it's too hot for the fish to be really biting. I've been getting alot of days off in the peak of summer beacuse of the heat."" Further excitement shines in her eyes as she adds, ""But I probably won't be back fishing 'til the eggs hatch because I got searched yesterday!"" She grins happily at the other girl at this last comment.

For as much interest as she shows about how Kaelana does more than lakeside or beach fishing, Niklo can't help but grin at the girl's excitement as she makes her announcement about having been recently searched. ""Glad it pleases ya,"" she tells her, knowing that while she might have mixed feelings about the idea that other people do not, ""Where was it? An' who chose ya? An' how'd it happen?"" Her questions are genuine curiousity, even if she herself wouldn't be as excited if the same had happened to her.

Kaelana happily obliges with the request, beginning in her best story telling voice, ""I was at the pool in the garden you see, then my brother on his bronze...R'layn and Talurith, swooped in an' went for a swim. Me and R'layn talked for a bit then Talurith came up and -breathed- on me, can you believe?"" She pauses to take a long drink of her juice, ""An' I guess he told R'layn that I would do good on the sands cause here I am, right? I can't wait to see the little dragonses up close.""

Niklo's eyebrows go up at the mention of R'layn and Talurith, and the girl's jaw drops for the second time this evening. ""He... he's your brother?"" Incredulous, she shakes her head. ""Whoa, you..."" a sigh, ""...sure are lucky."" A small smile and she nods, popping a few more nuts/seeds in her mouth and chewing carefully before swallowing hard and answering. ""Well, with dragonridin' in your family, I'm sure you'll Impress! I'm real glad for ya.""

Kaelana's expression reverts to one of confusion, for definately -not- only the second time this evening. ""Why'm I so lucky? He's a great brother...yah, but?"" She can only shake her head. Kae has since finished off her dinner and has set to nursing the quarter cup of juice, which she lowers to gaze at the other girl, ""You...you really think so?""

Glancing over her shoulder at the man, still wolfing down the plate she prepared for him earlier, Niklo gives the other girl a wry smile. ""You can say your brother's a great one,"" she replies, jerking her thumb at her own. ""Can't say the same 'bout 'im. Jus' the opposite, really."" Shaking her head, she sighs. ""Though, he's only my half-brother anyways."" The girl shrugs, then grins and tips her head a little to one side. ""I do think so, though. Really do!""

Kaelana nods sagely, finally understanding. ""But you don't see him very often I'm sure, right? I don't think I've seen him about before?"" A comforting smile is given, though it looks strained. She does, however, manage to hold back her own excitement to see if she can help, ""He's only here for a short time to see tha eggs too, right?""

Niklo smiles vaguely and nods, her lips pursed for a moment before she answers verbally, ""Yeah, since he left me here, 'bout two turns ago, he ain't cared what happens to me. Jus' came to see the eggs."" A soft snort, ""Prob'ly be back for the Hatchin'... but naw, don't gotta worry 'bout 'im too much."" She grins. ""What color would you Impress if you could pick, eh?""

Kamia enters from the narrow corridor.
Kamia has arrived.

Kamia slips out of the kitchen from her shift of tuber peeling like a good candidate. Truthfully, she was actually pretty fast, even if her humming was off key.

M'duk has arrived.

Kaelana's advice probably isn't the best, but she offers it anyways. ""Maybe get people to act really bad around him so he doesn't want to come back? That could work!"" Whether or not she actually thinks it's a good idea is left to the imagination. ""What...colour? I...I never really thought about it. What do you think?""

The other girl's suggestion brings a laugh from Niklo, and she has to cover her mouth quickly to tone it down a bit. ""Oh!"" she giggles, once she's collected herself a bit, ""You've got no idea how much I'd love t'pull somethin' like that on 'im!"" A grin at Kaelana. ""Been wantin' to do somethin' like that forever. But soon's somethin' bad 'appens I'm the one he blames, so it'd prob'ly not work too well."" A shrug. ""S'a great idea, though."" Still grinning in amusement, she lifts an eyebrow questioningly. ""I dunno! C'mon, you can't tell me you ain't never thought what color dragonet you'd like findin' ya on the sands?"" If she notices Kamia emerging from the kitchen, she makes no sign of it.

Kamia spears herself a slice of roasted herd beast, and adviods the tubers she helped to peel. She piles on some greens, and some sweets. It's alot for a teenage girl, more like a teenage boy. She also grabs some chilled juice to chase away the heat before making for a table.

M'duk is standing near the serving line talking with a few fellow riders. He laughs as he scans the room, taking in the crowd around him. After a few more words, followed by a few more laughs, M'duk parts ways with the riders and gathers himself a plate of dinner. Once he seems satisfied, he's moving for a seat with another wave of farewell to those he was talking with minutes before.

Kaelana's eyes sparkle with laughter at the response to her suggestion, however much help she actually intended with it. ""It'd be good wouldn't it? We could scare him far away from here!"" She gives an exagurated grin, ""Ideas are what I'm good at!"" The talk of firelizard colours make the girl adopt a thoughtful expression, hand against her chin, ""I never really wanted a certain color, they're all good, you know? With things that are so rare to begin with you can't just pick an' choose. Though I already have a cute little blue firelizard, I think he's sleeping out in the sun right now.""

Nolee walks in from the bowl.
Nolee has arrived.

Still amused, laughing softly every now and again, Niklo just shakes her head. ""If only he scared so easy,"" she replied with wry grin. ""An' if only I wouldn't get in trouble! But if I ever figured a way,"" a nod to Kaelana, ""I'd be sure to ask you fer help. Fer sure!"" As the other girl mentions a firelizard, she perks up. ""Firelizard, eh? You got one? Where?"" Wrinkling her nose in amusement she adds, ""How 'bout a blue dragon to go with a blue firelizard?"" A giggle.

Kamia grins as she spots her favorite friend in the whole wide world right now, balancing her plate lightly so she can wave at him. ""M'duk! Have some mashed tubers, I made them myself!"" She's got a sunburn over her face now, starting to peel, shimmering with the oil on it to make it softer and soothe it.

Nolee's entry is swift, especially for the young weyrwoman. She carries a large, overfull box, and from it snakes multiple tendrils of color that shift back and forth when she moves, as though they're alive. Peering over the top of the box, she scans the cavern. Resting the box edge against a table frees a hand to gesture to M'duk. ""Draeth's,"" she calls toward the poor guy who has just filled his plate.

M'duk smiles, and is just about to reply to Kamia when his name is called by Nolee. He steps toward her with a salute, ""Yes Ma'am?"" He asks, looking at the box with slight amusement. ""Rope drill?""

Kaelana gives a glance to all those walking in before turning back to Niklo. ""I'd be happy to help free you from an overbearing half-brother...It's my specialty."" She snickers lightly before tilting her head at the other girls interest of her firelizard, ""I think he's out at the beach somewhere. You can meet him later if you want?"" She considers the comment about dragon colour before shaking her head softly, ""I've had enough trouble with a little blue firelizard, let alone a giant blue dragon.""

Niklo gives a little nod and her trademark grin. ""I'm much appreciate the help!"" she replies in a thoroughly heartfelt tone. She's about to say more when she notices Kaelana looking elsewhere, and follows the other girl's gaze to spot M'duk, and then Nolee. Fortunately both appear to be occupied, which means she can go back to her conversation without interrupting it. ""I'd love to meet 'im,"" the girl nods vigorously at the mention of meeting Kaelana's firelizard. ""'Been wantin' one for awhile. I think they're great lil' critters."" A grin. ""Though, I do hear they're a lotta trouble. But I think..."" her grin broadens, ""Any dragon'd be a lotta trouble. Not jus' blues. I mean, think about the golds! They're huge!""

Kamia blinks confused as she sits her plate on a table, unsure of what's going on, watchin poor M'duk be picked on, and sort of glad it's not her.

Nolee nods as M'duk approaches. ""How'd you know?"" she looks genuinely surprised. ""Jays, one of the wings is scheduled to fly using these ropes, and the ones Nalaieth dragged out, and they're just a tangled mess."" She scans the cavern furtively, brown eyes lighting with the idea. ""I don't suppose you--oh! and the candidates would help separate them."" Then a bigger smile. ""That'd be perfect! You, over there!"" A gesture to the trio chatting nearby. ""Could you all give me a hand? I'm in need of some help.""

M'duk laughs. ""Just took a guess is all."" He steps back as Nolee starts calling out to those she's pointing at. He stops a drudge walking back into the kitchen and hands her his plate, ""Take this, please?"" The drudge takes it on the walk, and M'duk mutters to himself, ""Probably won't be needing that anymore...""

Kaelana hear's the word candidates and frowns, swiveling in her chair to look at the two who happen to be addressing her. She whispers across to Niklo with a raised brow, ""Do they want us over there or are they coming here?"" Her head turns back to the weyrwoman and rider, brow still raised as an indication of confusion. While waiting for an answer, she replies softly, ""A gold? One of those would eat me in one bite, ohhh no.""

Niklo's reaction to the word 'candidates' is the exact opposite of Kaelana's. ""I dunno... did she want me? I mean, I'm not a candidate or nothin'..."" As she says this she fights off grinning, laughing, even smiling. After a moment or two of intense struggle, she manages to straightfacedly mutter, ""Mebbe you should go ask?
Kamia looks at her hard earned food longingly for a moment as she heads forwards without hesitation to help with the ropes. Mentally she kicks herself for being amused by M'duk's misfortune.

Nolee picks up the box again and calls over her shoulder before she heads outside and toward the Northwestern bowl area, ""Yep, that's right, you three there. If you'd please follow me?"" Without waiting for their reply, and certain that helpful M'duk will trail her, she heads back into the bowl.

Nolee walks outside, into the bowl.
Nolee has left.

M'duk calls over Niklo, Kaelana and Kamia with a gesture of his hand. ""There's work to do, would you mind helping, Niklo?"" He awaits their approach.

Kamia just pouts, rubbing her poor grumbling stomach, she grabs two sandwiches, and her juice and trails after M'duk, handing off one to him.

And alas, Niklo gets her answer -- but not from Kaelana. Put in a rather tight situation to back out of, the poor girl can't really say no. So, as everyone apparently expects, she simply forces a smile and a nod to M'duk, pushes herself to her feet, and shuffles over to the brownrider. ""Atcher service!""

M'duk smiles as he accepts the sandwhich. ""Thanks."" He gestures the three towards the exit into the bowl. ""Hurry, we don't wanna keep her waiting.""

Kamia walks outside, into the bowl.
Kamia has left.

M'duk walks outside, into the bowl.
M'duk has left.

<b>Ista Weyr Bowl -- Southeast(#900RJMs$)

Clusters of dragons group around the large entrance to the living cavern. Smaller entrances line up to lead to the lower caverns and the infirmary. Smoke issues forth from square holes cut into the mountain high above the living cavern. The bowl extends to the northwest, and high above, the southernmost points of the spindles reach for the sky.
The sunset bathes the northeastern side of the bowl in red light.
The wet summer season oppresses the island with high humidity and sweltering temperatures. As the sun sets, the sun shines from a clear, blue sky and the air hardly moves more than a whisper.

Weyrs and entrances to the lower caverns are visible on all three sides of the Weyr walls that bound you.

Nolee arrives from the living caverns just as Nalaieth does, though the dragon has nudged over a number of crates containing mixed up ropes of many colors. Nolee upends the crates, starting with the one she's carrying, and begins sorting them from one another as Nalaieth stretches out her smoke-golden form and twitches her tail lazily back and forth. ""Jays, thanks!"" She hails as they arrive.

Draeth has arrived.

M'duk enters the bowl with Kamia, Kaelana and Niklo. He points to where Nolee is now standing. ""Alright, we're gonna be working over here."" As the group exits the living cavern, a brown form glides down from the skies above, landing about 20 meters away.

Kamia follows after M'duk, chewing on a sandwich as she heads over to Nolee to help with the sorting, having had to compermise on her dinner with something she could eat and work at the same time.

Trailing along behind the other three, Niklo can't keep her eyebrows from lifting slightly at the sight of the crates. All of them. So much work and... she isn't a candidate. Or a rider. Why should she have to help? But the girl keeps her thoughts to herself and, despite trailing behind, tries to maintain her cheerful attitude. ""Righto,"" she nods to M'duk.

Once all of the crates are dumped out, the 'easy part,' Nolee stands up and stretches her back side to side. She notices Jozell and waves, ""Hi! Don't look so glum, the sunset's beautiful! Though it makes it harder to see the tangles."" She surveys the scene, quite a mess it is, and smiles warmly at her helpers. ""If you help me with this, I'll give you each a sixteenth, and I won't tell Sulizath's either. She's the other organizer of the chores you candidates get to do,"" she blithely doesn't notice Niklo's absence of a white knot. ""and I get to organize them, too."" Delight! Her own private workforce.

Jozell sighs and looks up at Nolee. ""That's easy for you to say, your whole family hasn't tured up missing."" He snarls slightly before sighing again and looking back down at the floor.

M'duk laughs. He now lets the work force walk infront of him as the near the tangled mess. ""Is this fresh paint, Weyrwoman?"" He asks of Nolee. He sees the landing of Draeth, but does not pay him much attention. ""I don't want to get the jacket you gave me dirty."" A grin.

Kamia perks at the idea of an extra sixteenth... that would buy her some extra sweet grass for the new thing she was trying.... and quickly settles in, sandwich, juice, and starts to pull some the ropes towards herself, making sure to leave room with her for M'duk to sit down.

Riaceth sits up and bugles a welcome to the queen and the brown, then turns her head to examine the colored rope, seeming to know just what is going on. ""Hey -- company,"" Tegara says cheerfully. ""Hey there, Nolee,"" and the Junior Weyrwoman gets a quick salute, then a nod for her wingmate M'duk. ""Getting ready for a rope drill?"" stating the obvious, then jerks abruptly in Jozell's direction. ""What's the matter?"" her voice all concern now. ""I think you need a hug.""

Niklo hardly looks excited, even with the incentive of being paid. This shouldn't be her work! Protest, protest, protest! Yet while on the inside she's scraming 'unfair!' on the outside she smiles pleasantly and nods, plopping down on the ground and, gritting her teeth to keep her smile in place, picks up a tangle of ropes and begins unknotting them.

Jozell gives Tegara a gentle hug as she comes over to give him one. ""Neela has gone missing, with Neethell and his sister too."" His voice about breaking as he gets the statement out.

Nolee puts her hands on her hips, frowning at the paint, but then smiling at M'duk's spiffy jacket. ""Jays! You still have it. You must take good care of your things. Oh! And I think it's dry. Long dry, but maybe they were put away partly wet and stuck that way. Ohh, that's just the way. Thanks ever so much,"" she gushes to smile-pasted Niklo and eager-ish Kamia. Then Jozell's tone catches her attention, and she sombers. ""What's the trouble, woodcarver? Vanished?"" Though as Tegara's hug is better comfort, she falls silent to listen.

Draeth bugles back to Riaceth, continuing to lumber around. His rider, M'duk, nods back to Tegara, and grabs some of the rope himself and begins to pull, dry paint cracking along the way. ""Not a rope drill quite yet, just preperation."" He grins, looking back and forth between Kamia and Niklo. ""We enjoying our work?""

Every now and then a tangle of rope will still be damp at its very center where the ooeygooey colors stuck...be careful!

Jozell says softly. ""She left with the kids from her parent's place over a month and a half ago..She's over due by three weeks."" He says softly.

Kamia looks up, mouth half full, hands all full of ropes, watching Jozell for a moment as she untwists things in her hands. She looks up at M'duk. ""I enjoy anything that'll let me get what I need to make something for Daerth.""

Thanks to her experience weaving, Niklo has very little trouble with getting the ropes untangled, and doing so with fairly decent speed as well. As long as the ropes are dry, at least. The parts that are wet require a bit more attention, and the girl frowns as she hits these places, digging her fingers in with little thought or worry whether or not she'll get paint on herself. At M'duk's question she gives him one of her forced, pleasant smiles. She doesn't trust herself to say a word... especially when she's listening in on the conversation going on around her.

Nolee makes a halfhearted effort to separate some of the tangled ropes, tugging rather uselessly at one end, pushing haplessly at this or that knot. Occasionally, a rope actually separates from the others and falls to the ground, surely a fluke. She bites at her lip at the seriousness of Jozell's situation, but pretends not to be listening in too much. ""Good job!"" she encourages Niklo and Kamia instead.

""Hey Joz -- if you ever need me for anything just let me know. Maybe I should send Laz to stay with you for messages and I can sneak a bit of searching in whenever I can."" This last remark draws a bit of a snicker from her. She lets go and turns to the convoluted mass of ropes. ""Hmm,"" she muses, ""maybe drop some of them in a mass maybe, make 'em act like real Thread -- or so I've heard that Thread acts."" In the meantime Riaceth seems to be taking quite a shine to Nicklo, whom she watches intently, her eyes shining with the blue-green of intrest.

Jozell nods his head slightly to Nolee. ""Thanks for the offer he says softly."" His eyes are filling with tears again.

Draeth croons as M'duk relays Kamia's comment with a smile. ""That's not necessary, but you can if you'd like."" He nearly sticks his hand into a very wet part, but pauses at the last instant. ""Close one."" As he hears the situation Jozell describes, he leans in to whisper to Tegara. ""You know, I can talk to G'tive about sending out the Search and Rescue team?"" As he suggests this he turns to see what his brown thinks of the idea, but he's busy. Busy following Riaceth, busy approaching Niklo?

Kamia leans on M'duk's shoulder for a moment, smiling. ""You know I like doing it, like half your weyrling class has gotten some at some point in time. I just need to know what kind of scents you and Daerth like."" She goes back to eating and unknoting, intent on her food and money.

Jozell shakes his head and turns and starts to head twords the weyr, it seems he is having a hard time currently and moves off to be alone.

Reaching a part of the tangle she's working on that's simple, Niklo glances up just in time to watch Nolee make a rather pathetic attempt at working on the knots, giggles softly to herself, and goes back to work again. Okay, maybe she really does to be doing this... If the girl notices the dragon -- dragons? -- she doesn't make it obvious. Too busy working, too busy pretending to like it, and too busy snooping. Discreetly snooping, of course.

Nalaieth is fascinated by the other dragons being nearby as well, and her many-faceted eyes whirl as she watches them. She watches the humans, too, and periodically claws a strip of rope, tossing it around in leonine fashion before growing bored of it and letting the evening breeze carry it before it fwomps to the ground again. ""Draeth likes what?"" Nolee catches some of Kamia's words. ""Ooo, do you make scented things too? I like lavendar."" She watches Jozell move off with a sad shake of her head.

Kamia she nods at Nolee a bit, blushing despite her sunburn. ""Yeah.. I sunburned pretty bad my first year hear.. I started learning how to scent lotions and oils so I don't smell offensive. Then I started making them for friends dragons caused the dragons liked the pampering...""

His shoulders start shaking slightly after only a few steps, his head bows as he suddenly drops to his knees. Jozell crumples into a sitting position, sitting on his lower legs, his head bowed almost into his lap.

As the multi-colored pile begins to be seperated, Tegara pitches in as well, Riaceth watches with a sort of disinterest of intrest -- but most of her attention is fixed on Niklo. Something about that girl fascinates her, and her reaction does not go unnoticed by her lifemate. A quick glance at the green is all Tegara needs to understand what is going on.

M'duk shrugs at the mention of desirable smells. ""I don't know what we'd like, not yet atleast."" He untangles a large knot and tosses it to the ground. As Tegara and Riaceth become roused, this provokes Draeth even more. He half circles around the back of the group, stopping nearest Niklo. The brown looks to M'duk, then Riaceth, then back to Niklo. His rider, seeing something grab Tegara's attention, then turns around to Draeth. He cocks his head as a serious look takes over his face. It's clear to him as well, and he turns first to look at Tegara, Riaceth, back to Draeth, then Niklo.

So many people, and so many dragons, and so much... going on. Niklo wrinkles her nose and hunches over, focusing on the work she was sort of volunteered for. Someone's got to do it, so she might as well! It's not that she's not a chatty person, but all this talk of smelly things, and problems just isn't her style. So she concentrates on what she's doing instead... though she has this really odd feeling of being... watched? Naaah.

Nalaieth raises her head Kamia's way. -She- likes the pampering! Where's her oil? Her tail lashes slowly back and forth, leaving little cleared trails on the ground like a triangular tail-angel. Nolee chews at her lip, focusing on the knot untying for a long moment as she casts quick mournful glances Jozell's way, perhaps being the one of the only creatures there not staring at Niklo. At least, not until she notices that the dragons are. Even Nala picks up her head to watch. Ooo, interesting. What is it?

Riaceth stands to shuffle around to join Draeth behind Niklo, her head positioned so that she is literally looking over the girl's shoulder. ""What is it, Ria?"" her lifemate asks.

Kamia grins abit at Nalaieth's antics. ""Ok, ok.. shards.. I'll make you something pretty smelling for you so you can smell pretty and not get cracks at the same time... great for all those itchy spots."" She scratches her own itchy nose quietly.

""Pretty shi--"" Niklo starts to mutter, practically cringing at the idea of all this fancy stuff. She cuts herself off abruptly, however, and sits up straight. ""'Kay, this's gettin' weir..."" Looking around to see why on Pern she might be feeling like something is breathing down the back of her neck, she turns enough that Riaceth can be spotted from the corner of her eye. ""Oh!"" she exclaims, letting out a long sigh. ""Hey there. Need somethin'?"" the girl asks the dragon, smiling genuinely for the first time.

M'duk, looking at Draeth, answers Tegara's question faintly. ""They want her to stand..."" He says with slight shock in his words. He looks to Niklo with a smile, but does not say anything yet.

Jozell shakes his head, quietly after sobbing to himself for a short bit. He then /slams/ his fist into the ground and forces his way to his feet and moves himself twords the living cavern. He weaves slightly undeady on his feet.

Tegara turns from M'duk to Ria to Niklo and back again. Ria? she mouthes, and the green gives a soft snort. ""Uh, Niklo?"" she asks hesitantly as she rises from the ground. ""I think you'll want to stand up right now -- I have something very important to tell you."" Riaceth pulls back, with something that could be described as a smug grin. ""You are now a Candidate at Ista Weyr, and will stand for the clutch hardening in the sands.""

Nalaieth whuffs softly, stirring the ground up and blowing some of the ropes about helpfully. She, it seems, gets no such tingles about anybody and is therefore much more interested in the promise of lotions and oils. ""I think Nala was hoping you'd make it for her..."" she starts off with a small giggle, then is raptly focused on Niklo. ""If she agrees!"" she pipes up. ""She hasta say yes first. It's in the rules!""

Jozell walks into the huge living cavern.
Jozell has left.

M'duk smiles and adds after Nolee speaks. ""Congratulations Niklo."" He looks to Kamia, ""He only sees the best."" A grin takes over and he stands formally, looking at Niklo again, awaiting an answer

Kamia smirks up at M'duk, but grins at Niklo. ""I guess you were doing the work for a reason after all!"" She laughs happily at that.

Tipping her head to one side curiously, Niklo begins to question why she would need to stand up, until she catches the last part of what Tegara says -- important. Not just to give the lovely green scritches, but important? She stands, looking to the greenrider expectantly, and then... blinks hard. ""Wait, *what*?!"" the girl seems to choke, listens to everyone around her, and then begins to stutter. ""Y'mean... I... ya couldn't... I--"" Pause. Deep breath. ""Really?"" Shock and disbelief written all over her face, the girl looks from one rider to another, questioning. ""Ya mean it?""

Tegara nods. ""Sure as the sun rises, Niklo. I had a hunch that this would happen the first time I met you, and Riaceth has shown it true. So, what is your answer -- yea or nay?"" But she has a good idea as to what the answer will be.

M'duk nods along. ""Sure. It is now on you whether you stand or not."" He smiles, looking to Tegara as if to say: Like she is gonna say no.

Nolee nods her head slowly, almost wordlessly. ""This is fun,"" she comments. ""If she says it, she means it. Especially with them both here, like this. Ooo,"" she claps her hands together, dropping the ropes. ""That would be a mean joke, though. We could play it on your brother. Well, Nala could. What do you say, anyway? You get to do more than chores if you say yes. Well, heaps of those, too.""

Wide-eyed and shuffling her feet at being put on the spot so suddenly, Niklo can't find her voice at first. She bites her lip, swallows, opens her mouth and squeaks, closes it to swallow again, and then... ""I-I guess... I mean, it don't hurt to jus' stand, right? An' I'm gonna be doin' chores no matter what,"" glance at Nolee, who isn't really helping things, ""So, uhm, alright?"" Again, more certain this time. ""Alright. I'll... I'll do it. I'll stand."" A decided nod.

Tegara smiles warmly, fleeting memories of her own Searching flashing through her mind. ""Then Stand you shall, but in the meantime it's chores and chores and chores. But just remember that all of us dragonriders had to go through the same thing."" Suddenly the image of Nolee cleaning latrines flashes through her mind and she starts to giggle hysterically.

M'duk nods as Niklo confirms that she will stand. He looks to Tegara. ""Would you like to get her situated in the Barracks, or would you rather I do it."" He turns to Niklo, ""You are going to need to move all of your belongings from your normal cot into the Candidate Barracks."" To Kamia, ""It seems as if they are filling up, no?""

Nolee smiles brightly, encouragingly. Girl might as well get a new knot for her trouble! Nalaieth, meanwhile, has put her head down, claiming some of the ropes her paws have dragged close as a makeshift pillow. ""Could hurt a little; sometimes they attack on the sands, but,"" she reassures, ""I haven't seen anyone die yet."" She looks sadly at the ropes, realizing she may be about to lose a worker. ""Hm. Well, I'm one of the organizer people, so if you have questions, I'm here to help. Hope you don't have many belongings; it's close in there. But fun, mostly.""

Kamia nods her agreement at M'duk. ""But are we ever going to any boy canidates.. I know people keep saying the shiny egg is a queen, but there's probaly atleast one bronze!"" She grins a bit, since she's been leading the gossip over the eggs at times.

Despite her shocks, Niklo can't help but smile a little at the mention of moving all her things into the Barracks. ""Finally,"" she sighs, ""A good reason to move outta Uncle's place..."" A hesitant grin, as she slowly comes back to herself, and she winks at Nolee. ""Been watchin' Hatchings since I was a younglin'."" As if that was so long ago. ""Ain't see anybody die either. 'Course, I might jus' be the first, but..."" Her grin broadens. Yup, she's back folks!

Tegara nods to M'duk's question. ""I can take care of it,"" she says, giggles subsiding. ""Nikro, would you like to gather up your things and move on over to the Candidate Barracks?"" the answer now being shown as a very strong positive. ""It's gonna be cramped and noisy, but like Nolee said"" and a smile and nod are sent her way, ""there should be enough fun to ease the burden of chores."" She shoos off Riaceth and waits at the girl's side.

Nolee nods complacently, pleased for the girl she saw being smacked by said Uncle just sevendays before. ""That's very good indeed! Chores will seem like nothing in comparison. I promise I don't smack, either, but I can't say anything for Sulizath's. She's grouchy sometimes."" Her head tilts, and she ooos. ""It'll probably smell less if you don't get any boys,"" she confides quietly to Kamia. Nala bugles, then, brassy, jazzy approval of Riaceth and of her own offspring, Draeth, and their evening's work.

Draeth apparently pleased with their work as well, bugles loudly as he takes to the air. Spins soon follow as the brown gets the excitement out of his system. M'duk smiles as well, nodding to Tegara. ""Very well. Good luck throughout your Candidacy, Niklo."" He smiles, ""But I'll most likely be able to say that to both,"" he nods to Kamia. ""Of you as you work the living cavern shifts.""

Kamia smiles up at him. ""I'm used to it, I've been working in the lower caverns since I moved here, remember?"" She chuckles at him. ""Yeah, boys smell, but we still need them.""

Niklo just smiles widely at Tegara, then shakes her head. ""Don't care 'bout cramped,"" is her quick reply, ""or smelly boys, neither,"" she adds for Nolee's benefit, catching her quiet comment to Kamia and grinning. The girl gives a little half bow, half nod to M'duk, murmuring 'thank you' and then looks back to the greenrider standing near her. ""You ain't got no idea how glad I'd be to move. Soon's I can, too."" Sage nod. ""Definitely.""

Nolee goes halfheartedly back to work untangling the ropes, though by this time they've actually managed to make some headway. The wing that's suppposed to drill with them on the morrow seems to have sent a few stragglers their way, as well, and they're working on some of the more spread out ropes, leaving the suggestion that they might actually finish their task someday. ""You get your own cot, too!"" she enthuses. ""And a press!""

M'duk goes back to work as Tegara takes over. He picks up the rope again, shaking his head. ""I remember my first rope drill. Smacked dead in the face by red rope. Tasted horrid."" Another shake of his head.

Kamia snickers softly, leaning into him again. ""Finish your sandwich M'duk."" She fusses a bit as she works a tangle out.


<b>Ista Weyr Living Cavern(#1100RJMs$)
The cavern is dim now, the only light provided by the night hearth, on the northern wall near the large bowl entrance, to the northwest. The one or two drudges on duty now amuse themselves by playing little games, or checking the food kept warm in the one lit hearth. A small uncovered basket of glows illuminate the entrance from the rest of the lower caverns, to the west.
Several huge tapestries, many of them ancient, are hanging on the stone walls. One particularly glorious one looks to be a study on the finger rock. You also see several 'places' to sit.

It's a pleasant respite from the public bustle of the living cavern to the west.
The cavern runs south, along which you can see many rooms opening out into the rock. East are more rooms, and the archway to the Living Cavern to the west.

Discussion on work, betting, and craziness persues.""><b><br />Ista Weyr Beach: North(#522RJMs)<br /><br />Sunset at the beach: as the cool wind blows in from over the waters, the sallow sun slips below the wave-tossed sea that fades from green to black. The light of Rukbat washes the beach, the forests to your south, and the great black rock of the Weyr behind you in crimson light. The stars climb up over the Weyr and the plateau to your east, rising above the mist cast by the dancing waterfall that glows in a million firey rainbows. The black sands of the beach stretch for kilometres to the north and south, following the shoreline of the plateau. Below the pastel beauty of the blue-green sunset sky to the west, the dark smudges of the Ista Isles float on the sea, like the coils of some mythical monster.<br /><br />The wet summer season oppresses the island with high humidity and sweltering temperatures. As the sun sets, clouds interrupt the sky and a nice, light breeze carries the scent of sea air.<br />To the northwest, a bridge arches over the stream. To the south, the beaches continue to where long docks stretch far into the bay.<br />Contents:<br />Seliene<br />Nolee<br />Obvious exits:<br />Plateau  Docks  WaterFall  The Sandbar  Sea  </b><br /><br />The summer evening during Ista's wet season brings some to the beach, the soft wind still pleasant enough for outdoor resting. A few people walk back and forth, some aiming for the water, others for the Sandbar, one grizzled sailor for the docks. Nolee's seated on the beach, a wide tangle of woven rope crossing and crisscrossing across her lap. She's retying and mending segments of what could be a cumbersome and gap-laced blanket, but is more likely a large ocean-fishing net with a few unraveling strands. One bit twists over another with some grunting noises, and arms and legs cross over one another to hold the dratted rope still.<br /><br />Seliene makes her way up the beach, her attention seemingly fixated on the docks in the distance. She appears to be looking for something - or someone. She's so engrossed in her 'mission' that she fails to see Nolee in her path and almost trips over her. Almost. She stops herself just in time, stumbling a bit and managing to fall out of one of her sandals. ""Shards..."" she mutters, hopping around on one foot.<br /><br />""I ain't too young to be bettin'!"" Just in front of the Sandbar stands Niklo, being lectured by a hunched old man who's busy waving a finger at her. The girl looks as though she's barely paying attention, too busy protesting. ""Aw, c'mon Uncle. I earned them marks, fair! I should be able to--"" she's promptly cut off by a sharp slap, and hissing angrilly she turns and runs for the beach.<br /><br />Nolee the Net Monster pokes her head up through one of the large gaps in the net, and she blinks, wide-eyed, at the bright blue-eyed girl. ""Jays, watch it! You were almost my first catch of the day, tangled up in my net, the way you were walking all wobbly-like."" Her eyes knit, and she squints at Seliene, assosciating her with the voice from the direction of the Sandbar and figuring her stumbling must be related to proximity to liquor. ""It's a little early to be in your cups, wouldn't you say?"" The slap makes her wince, however, and she of the short attention span is raptly fascinated by the running figure just beyond. ""Ooo, that sounded like it hurt.""<br /><br />Nolee's citron-enhanced highlights offer brightness to hair of dishwater blonde. Of medium-length, it curls at the ends in a helmet-induced tidy flip, but is held back by a pink and tan braided headband, its decorative beads drawing attention to her arched brows and large, expressive brown eyes. Her hands are marred with a crisscross of tiny white scars, and neatly manicured nails sport a pale pink polish but are showing signs of wear.<br /><br />A comfortable distance away from her great-uncle, Niklo slows her breakneck speed so she doesn't do just that -- break her neck by losing her footing in the sand. Instead she trudges along, hands clenched into white-knucked fists at her sides, cursing under her breath. If she notices the other two young women nearby she certainly doesn't show it.<br /><br />Nolee sits up, straightening her posture even while she tugs on the net round her neck, trying to remove it where it's lodged over her ear. ""It isn't dark!"" A quick glance around moves the net to and fro, then she sighs. ""Well, it wasn't when I started, anyway."" Her arm goes through another hole, tugging at the woven rope even as she's gazing off into the distance again. ""What's at the docks? Besides smelly men. Especially today. Shipment in, I heard."" As Niklo comes closer, Nolee raises her voice to tactlessly call, ""What'd you do?""<br /><br />Still cussing, the girl looks up at Nolee's call, a bit startled. But she recovers easily, and a slow, bitter grin crosses her face. ""Be born a girl, that's what I did,"" Niklo replies, a odd note in her voice. ""Don't bother yourself with it."" Beginning to turn away, it's only then that she recognizes Nolee and immediately she's whirling around again, apologetic. ""Oh! I-I'm sorry, I didn't realize... I mean, I didn't mean to be disrespectful... please don't be angry... too...""<br /><br />Nolee purses her lips as her first question isn't answered directly, but her focus wanders back to her work as a patch-rope is woven in. Then she's blinking, puzzled, her head tilted sideways. ""Can't've helped that. Being born a girl, I mean. It's not so bad, really. Others will usually help with work if you look like you need it. Were you trying to get out of work? I can teach you some hints if you were."" A pause, then deviously, ""If you weren't, you could help with this. It's itchy. Oh, and why would I be angry too?""<br /><br />Seliene looks toward the docks, having been momentarily distracted by Niklo. ""I was...looking for a friend of mine. He works on the docks."" She shrugs and reaches down to brush sand from her dress.<br /><br />Niklo smiles faintly at the young woman, then shakes her head. ""Y'know the dragon clutch?"" Pause. ""Oh. Well, 'course you know it. But, well, anyway,"" the girl takes a deep breath, then sighs, ""Since the flight I've been doin' some extra stuff, savin' up for bets, right? But Uncle don't think girls should bet."" She makes a face. ""He don't think girls should do nuthin'."" An eyeroll, though she does tip her head to one side and eye the net Nolee's working on. ""Never worked a net a'fore. S'it like weavin'?""<br /><br />Finding a little success as one end of the patch rope goes where it is supposed to, Nolee grunts, then grins. ""I used to know someone who worked down there pretty well."" Niklo's topic brings the end of the story as well, ""But then he Impressed,"" her voice turns wry, ""And became the Weyrleader at that Fort place."" Hmph. ""I hope your friend bathes at least,"" is offered to Seliene before she pats the rope and nods to Niklo. ""Like knitting but with big ropes and your hands. And that's silly. Heaps of girls bet. Like uh...well, heaps of 'em.""<br /><br />Seliene smiles a bit wistfully. ""He smells nice enough,"" she notes, looking down at the net as Nolee pats it. ""Knitting, eh? Some of the old aunties have been trying to teach me to knit. I think I've finally shaken off the family's domestic craft curse - I'm actually getting the hang of it.""<br /><br />Niklo raises her eyebrows at Seliene's reply to Nolee, then wrinkles her nose. But somehow she manages to hold her tongue for once, and instead looks back to the Junior Weyrwoman. ""Well,"" she begins with a shrug, ""I ain't never knitted, but I've been weavin' baskets since I was five. If you want help, I'll give what I can.""<br /><br />Nolee smiles brightly. ""I can knit! Really fast, too. Or so some of the other girls have said. Jays, that's something I don't see boys doing much, knitting. But if they did, they could mend nets as quick as me. Well, the smaller ones, at least."" The big ones are some trouble, as this one proves, but she's resolute. ""You will? Thanks! Say, how about grab that blue-marked part of the rope over there and put it through this opening?"" One is held still. ""Then through this one.""<br /><br />Seliene folds her legs and sits down nearby. ""I can knit, but not very fast. My first project ended up be wider than when I started out. But, I've gotten better!"" She eyes the net carefully, however. ""I'd offer to help but I'd hate to screw it all up for you.""<br /><br />Niklo nods faintly, doing ask asked, while looking to Nolee and commenting, ""Mebbe not knitting, but I see a lotta boys in the kitchen, or the infirmary."" Her nose wrinkles. ""Seems strange, but whatever."" The girl looks the rest of the net over and then frowns at the goldrider, ""You were gonna fix this whole thing yourself? That's crazy."" Pause. ""'Course, riders are always crazy, but even so.""<br /><br />Nolee shakes her head. ""Mending them is easy. If it goes wrong, just cut off the bad and put a new patch in,"" she reassures. ""What did you knit?"" As the rope passes through the opening, she allows it to close, then takes the rope's loop and gives it a twist before tucking the end through another part of the large knot. ""Boys in the infirmary. Now that's trouble."" Then a shrug. ""I don't mind it. They're easy enough. Beats wherrybutted record copying.""<br /><br />Seliene snorts softly, poking at the sand with her index finger. ""It was supposed to be a scarf for my brother. It ended up looking like a cape. I scrapped it and started over. Maybe he'll get it in time for his next Turnday."" She smiles a bit. ""Crazy is a prerequisite for becoming a rider, I think,"" she murmurs.<br /><br />As Nolee works the younger girl watches her intently, as though trying to memorize what she does with the rope. ""Hm,"" she murmurs to herself, ""So that's how ya do it..."" Falling silent to observe, Niklo doesn't pay attention to the conversation until Seliene speaks, and then she's suddenly alert to the other two again, grinning. ""I dunno, seems like dragons make folks crazy,"" her opinion is voice. ""Which is why I'm much rather have a firelizard.""<br /><br />Nolee concentrates on the knot, smiling satisfied once it's secured by a few more mysterious intertwinings. ""Capes can be nice, too?"" she offers, smirking at the idea of a boy wearing a knitted one, then twisting her lips in a vague pout. ""I'm not crazy."" Then Niklo's words are seized upon, ""Jays, that must be it. Dragons are heaps of trouble. Though, firelizards are plenty of trouble of their own."" She rolls her eyes, then starts on another part of the net patch.<br /><br />Seliene rolls her eyes. ""Firelizards are more work than dragons, if you ask me. And they make a lot of noise, for no reason in particular, from what I've noticed."" She starts drawing figures in the sand - sand doodles, if you will. ""Hard for me to say, really, about the whole crazy thing. You see, everyone in my family is at least a little crazy and only half of them have Impressed over the Turns.""<br /><br />Niklo sighs heavily, making a face. ""Well, firelizards might be pest, an' they might be trouble, but I still say they don't make ya go crazy like dragons do! All that... that talkin' in yer head, an then how riders act during flight!"" At this she can't help but grin a bit immaturely, though she quickly wipes the expression off her face and pushes onward, ""I wouldn't want it. I like actin' the way I wanna act, thankyaverymuch!""<br /><br />Nolee snorts unabashedly. ""Not more work, noooo. Dragons are huge! Especially when you're looking over their tall back with a scrub brush."" A headshake. ""At least Nala's befriended a whole heap of firelizards to help with her baths."" Said Nala is fairly far off in the distance of the ocean, youthfully rolling around in the dark in the water. ""Ugh, yah,"" is her agreement. ""But there's nothing but rules all over. No escaping them, unless you go hide in the jungle. Which isn't very safe. Or comfortable.""<br /><br />Seliene shrugs. ""Most of that craziness is just the true rider's personality coming out to play, during flight's and all. My father used to pick fights during flights. Normally, he wouldn't hurt a vtol. He's even afraid of tunnelsnakes - still is, judging by his reaction the other night when he thought he saw one."" Seli rolls her eyes at the memory.<br /><br />Niklo can't help but giggle at Seliene's story, but remains steadfast in her opinion. ""I wouldn't make a rider, then, cuz I ain't got a personality to act like that!"" Vigorous headshaking. ""An' I wouldn't want a voice in my head all the time. That just seems..."" she trails off, not quite sure what to call it. ""Not good."" Yes, that's the technical term. ""'Sides, my momma couldn't have wanted Brother's dad. He *was* a tunnelsnake. Or worse. That was jus' the dragons messin' with 'em, right?"" The girl looks to the older girls questioningly. ""...Right?""<br /><br />Nolee's nose wrinkles. ""Eeew, tunnelsnakes."" She reflects on this topic a moment, then shakes her head, which is finally free of the net. After a few more pushes, pulls and tugs, the unraveled portion of the net seems mostly mended, and Nolee folds her arms across her midsection, something there between a frown and an expression of consideration. ""I don't know about all dragons, but mine picked someone at least nice last time? And having her voice in my head is only annoying sometimes. Mostly, it's helpful.""<br /><br />Seliene shrugs, getting to her feet. ""I wouldn't know, myself. I think I've only had Jakenath's voice in my head once my entire life. Pleasant enough - and it didn't make me crazy. Or crazier, as the case may be."" She glances off toward the docks again, brushing sand from her skirts. ""Excuse me but I'd better get moving. Nice talking to you and all that.""<br /><br />Seliene heads to the south end of the beach and Ista's docks.<br />Seliene has left.<br /><br />Her question not really answered, Niklo doesn't push the matter further. After all, she might not really want the answer after all. ""Well..."" the girl begins to say something, stops, and instead watches Seliene get to her feet. She grins at the older girl, nods as she announces her departure, and then waves after her. Only then does she speak, more a mumble, ""My mother was a goldrider,"" then louder, ""What's it like being a goldrider?""<br /><br />Nolee shakes her head uncertainly. ""Not like it spreads like the sniffles or anything."" A soft sniff accompanies Seliene's exit. ""Hope he's clean this evening at least, whoever he is."" She allows a little smile, then pushes the net aside and stretches her legs in the sand. ""Like?"" The pear-shaped girl strains sand through her fingers. ""Lots of names to remember. Too many. And boring hidework. And you have to be polite. But my weyr's got its own bath! And a slate board where Gree-r leaves my schedule."" Slump; work, ugh.<br /><br />Niklo bites her lip, then covers a giggle at Nolee's comment, quickly going serious again, however. But not for long. She tips her head to one side, studying the young woman carefully for a moment or two, then blurts out, ""You don't like work much, do ya?"" Tactful she's not. ""Most of it sounds like... bein' a holder. Rules an' manners an'..."" She makes a face. ""Bein' a holder sounds like a lotta work from what I've heard. Sounds stuffy! Bein' a goldrider ain't like that, is it?""<br /><br />Nolee smiles brightly, not minding at all the identification of one of her weaknesses. ""Nope! Avoid it all I can. Hard to sneak off anymore though; people recognize me too easily. That's the worst of it. And then if I do foolish things, they tell Gree-r."" Poor thing. ""Exactly! Just like being a holder. Except..."" she turns thoughtful, pensive. ""Nobody hits me if I mess up. So in that way, no, it's not like that.""<br /><br />Grinning now, amused, and her worries quite forgotten, Niklo queries, ""But you got a dragon, don'tcha? You don't gotta hide 'round 'ere, you can go..."" a shrug, ""anywhere!"" Considering this, the girl half rethinks her strikes against being a dragonrider and adds one to the pluses. ""I wouldn't mind goin' anywhere, that'd be great. An' ridin' a dragon's fun. A little scary, but fun. Though,"" she grimaces, ""Goin' *between ain't fun at all.""<br /><br />Nolee looks up from her sand-grain sorting to peer fascinatedly at her companion, getting through part of an answer before she's distracted. ""But the dragons talk to each other, so they know I'm coming. And Nala's big; she's hard to hide. And between's not so bad, once you get used to it--Say, why don't you brush your hair? If it's too much knotted, Gree-r has nice lotions and things that can go in it. They help make mine all shiny."" She folds the edge of the net forward out of her way, semi-tidying it, then fluffs her hair. ""Cept I get the color other ways.""<br /><br />Niklo doesn't seem terribly bothered by Nolee's rapid-fire topic changing. She just shrugs to the first part, then shakes her head violently. ""Nope! Nope, nope, nope. S'too shardin' cold, an' nothin', an'... ugh."" The girl shudders. ""No way I'd get used to it, never!"" Her emphasis on this is interrupted by a grin, as the goldrider changes topics and makes her laugh. ""Nobody brushed my hair when I was a younglin', so it did this,"" she gestures to her mop of hair, ""only it was thicker pieces. So I ripped it apart into the strands, then rolled 'em and now it's stuck like that. S'real easy to take care of."" She wrinkles her nose. ""'Sides... what good do the Weyrwoman's nice stuff do me?""<br /><br />Nolee jumps back and forth with Niklo, comfortable answering the comments and questions alike. ""Get thicker leathers. Besides, it's nowhere near as cold as some of those snowy places. And it only lasts a few seconds, despite the feeling something's smushing up your chest."" She watches the other's hair move, or not move, as it's gestured at. ""It did?"" Her nose wrinkles too, though very different is the cause. ""That's just...jays, you could be carrying insects in there. Larvae and everything! Or else, maybe a baby tunnelsnake. Or a vtol nest!"" After a few more guesses, she finally answers, ""Well, you'd get a nice brush out of it, if nothing else. And a new haircut.""<br /><br />Making a very unpleasant face at Nolee's description of between, Niklo shakes her head. ""A few seconds is a few seconds too long, thanks."" A quick shake of her head. ""Nope, not for me. Nope, nope."" Her usual grin returns the moment the older girl suggests what might be crawling in her hair. ""Naw!"" she scoffs, still grinning, ""S'not like I don't keep it clean. 'Sides, if there was anything in it I'm pretty sure I'd notice. An' then I'd get rid of it."" Sage nod. ""But,"" her expression goes a bit wry, ""I couldn't talk to the Weyrwoman. Why'd she wanna talk to me? An' more, why'd she wanna help me out?""<br /><br />Nolee peers more closely, not trusting of this reassurance. ""But how could you tell? It's all twisted up and tangled. Things could easily hide in there."" Unconsciously, she scratches at her head, reflexive itching. ""She likes to help people,"" Nolee brightly replies. ""And she worked with making herbal things before she was you know, as fussy as she is now.""<br /><br />Niklo points at Nolee, scratching her head. ""Like that,"" is her reply, a nod accompanying it. ""I'd itch. 'Sides,"" the girl grins wickedly, ""Even if there's stuff in there, s'long as I don't noticed it, I don't care. It's welcome to be there!"" At the goldrider's comment about Griere, she blinks hard. ""...Really? I didn't know."" A sheepish look, though she she smiles lopsidedly. ""But I don't want a haircut. I like my hair.""<br /><br />Nolee kicks her foot out, further folding over the mended net onto itself, then tugs her toes back into her lap, knee bent, while she rubs at the now itchy place. ""I guess you would."" She watches intently, as though Niklo would start said scratching any moment. ""I had to cut off my hair when we moved into the stinky barracks, but so did everyone else. It would've been coated with...things anyway, if we hadn't. Have you been flying much?""<br /><br />Not itching, though watching Nolee do so with great amusement, Niklo shakes her head at the question which sends strands of knotted hair bouncing about her shoulders. Eek, it moves! Oh noes! Still the girl doesn't scratch, or even act as though she's considering it. ""The only flyin' I've ever done was with my brother, about two turns ago. When he brought me 'ere.""<br /><br />In the air overhead, Riaceth soars out of the bowl proper, and out over the corrals.<br />In the air overhead, Riaceth heads towards the lagoon of the pool and garden area.<br /><br />Nolee reaches out, unable to restrain the impulse. ""Can I touch it? It looks like it would feel like porcine fluff."" Her fingers pause midway outstretched, however, to consider this. ""You haven't? But I thought you said your mum was a rider. Didn't you go with her places? Or did you get a wetnurse and a fostering instead? I can't imagine a weyrwoman having time for a squalling babe."" Another simple and somewhat disgusted headshake. ""I don't know how Tansith's does it.""<br /><br />Niklo shrugs, ""You can if you want. S'a bit courser, I think, but a lotta folks tell me that."" She sits still so the young woman can touch her hair. At the questioning of her mother, however, she can't help but smile. ""Neither, actually. She died givin' birth to me an' my twin brother. S'prob'ly why, twins are hard sometimes, I've heard. My half-brother an' his dad raised me mostly, then brouht me 'ere to my great-uncle."" At this last part she makes a face.<br /><br />Permission essentially granted, Nolee's fingers contact the unusual hair. ""Coarse. That's a good word for it. Like if a runner had curls, but different."" Her hand snakes back to her lap, her mouth twisting awkwardly in the 'oops, faux pas' shape. ""She did? Jays, I'm sorry about that. My mum's still around, here even, getting into my business and--well."" She breaks off, considering. ""He's the one who,"" and a gesture to her cheek.<br /><br />""Everybody's sorry 'bout it, when I tell 'em,"" Niklo says, obviously not phased in the least, ""but I never knew her. I never knew my dad, either, an' he offed 'imself when she died. They were my parents, but that don't mean a whole lot to me, y'know? Strange, but... eh."" A shrug, and then she purses her lips, giving a small nod. ""Uncle. He ain't... the easiet person to live with. Brother said he's to look after me, an' then I'm to look after 'im, so I'm stuck for now. 'Till he kicks it.""<br /><br />Nolee nods slowly. ""Sometimes I think I wish I didn't meet my mum again, after she and pop went their separate ways."" Her lips wrinkle. ""Then other times, I'm glad to have someone here I know."" Her brown bovine eyes widen. ""He did?! Aw, that's heaps of awful. You could lose him with some of the old Aunties who sew or knit, maybe. The healers help tend them some so you can slip away. I could show you a good hiding place; no one ever found me there."" She puts her hand over her mouth, holding the rest in before she spill other treasured secrets. ""But it was a kid's place.""<br /><br />Niklo grins wryly, ""Brother's heaps'a awful. S'just the way he is. But Uncle,"" she rolls her eyes, ""He's usually not too bad. S'long as I come up with reasons not to be nearby, I'm alright. It's pretty easy to stay on 'is good side, long as he doesn't catch ya doin' somethin' he don't approve of. Like... gamblin'.""<br /><br />Nolee stands up slowly, stretching out her legs as she does so, then gradually tugging the ends of the large net so that a set of blue-banded ends of the rope are vaguely visible in the darkening night. ""You could try to apprentice someplace? Or maybe see if someone would take you on somehow; then you'd have a good reason. Unless you already did that. And besides,"" she tosses her hair, a new gesture by the awkwardness of it, ""Gamblin' should be fine for boys or girls.""<br /><br />""I plan to,"" Niklo replies with a sigh, ""But still... can't bring myself to leave the wherry-brained old man alone. He'd hurt 'imself an' I'd be to blame."" The face she makes at this is ruined by a jaw-snapping yawn, and she quickly catches herself. ""Ugh. S'gettin' late. I'd better get outta 'ere an' back, 'fore I get myself into more trouble."" She smiles genuinely at the goldrider. ""Really good talkin' to ya. Never guessed I'd have a real conversation with a weyrwoman without makin' myself look like a real fool."" A grin. ""Or more of one than I usually come across as.""<br /><br />Nolee considers this new information with her brows wrinkled, torn between saving the old guy from himself and her personal desire for freedom. ""That's good of you,"" she finally decides, erring on the side of propriety even if it might not be her personal choice. ""I should, too, now that we're done with this."" As if on cue, the large smoke-shimmering form of Nalaieth emerges from the water into the air, huge wings beating gingerly to minimize sand spray as she comes close enough to pick up the net's carefully set out pieces and fly off with them. ""Good evening, then. And I'm Nolee, by the way. Have a safe walk up; that path's not always the steadiest.""<br /><br />Niklo unconsciously sighs at the sight of gold dragon, though she quickly recovers herself and grins. ""No worries, but thanks for the warning!"" the girl replies, already on her way back to the path. She pauses to wave, as an afterthought, then turns and picks up her pace to what might almost be a hurry? Nah.<br /><br />Nolee offers a wave as Niklo does, and a wry hmph for the departing dragon who seems to be leaving her to walk home as well. ""Ingrate!"" she calls Nala's way, then starts her own trek up the long walk to the plateau.<br /></lj-cut>"

"event","11   V'lano            Fri Dec 15 19:54 2006 The basket of yarn

Word has it that the weyrleader has been recently spotted carrying around a basket of yarn - first in the gardens, later in the living cavern at the supper hour; on another day he was carrying the thing through the bowl on his way, ostensibly, to check out storage rooms off the weyrling barracks. Despite repeated rumors over the turns regarding his drinking choices at the Sandbar, few would be the souls who would accuse the man of having a knitting habit, so the reasons he's carrying the basket around have varied with each telling of the tale. But after a day in which the yarn was left unattended for a couple of hours by a hearth in the kitchens, a more reliable story's come out - there are firelizard eggs in there with the balls and skeins of yarn, and often as not a cheeky and clumsy little gold brooding around them. 

The eggs will hatch at some point in the near future. In the meantime have a look here and there - you never know where Vel might leave that basket so he can sneak away for a few minutes' peace!

"event","<lj-cut text=""Aerianth's Clutching"">Hatching Galleries -- Ista Weyr(#1300RJQqs)
The galleries provide more than adequate seating for guests who have been invited to watch a hatching. There are ten tiers, that arch in a semi-circle from the southwest to west side of the black stone cavern. Stairs lead down to the entrances, which are visible beyond the large gaping opening leading to the Senior Queen's Weyr. You have a view of the Hatching Sands as well as a clear view of the ledges up above you.
The people here are Tzivya, and R'tran.
Stairs to the southwest lead out of the hatching grounds. Please type '+viewhelp' to see information on checking out the clutch.

R'tran gives a little wave and grin before turning his attention to the sands.

Amongst the excited members of the Weyr's population filing into the galleries for the forthcoming show is two young women - Tzivya and Niklo. Excitable at the best of times, the older of the two girls is bouncing along next to her young friend, her expression a wide smile and her posture tense with excitement. ""See? SSaid it would be soon! And now they are coming, and there'll be candidates and weyrlings and it will all be very exciting, a good distraction! And this is your first one here, isn't it, Nik? So it's extra special! Where do you wanna sit? I say up front if we can find places, so we can see as best we can!""

From the sands, Aerianth, gravid queen that she is, chooses to make her entrance in a leisurely fashion, though already the tremors of delivery shudder along her pale sides. As the weyr is quick to gather for such momentous events as a new clutch, the galleries are already dotted with people and the gold turns to whirl an irritated eye at them.

Meandering steps mark Nolee's ascent of the cavern's steps, as though she might be lost and just happening in at this particular moment. A bowl is in her arms, soon revealed to be filled with rather hot and fresh cookies, judging by the audible 'ow!' as her too-eager fingers are singed. ""Stupid cookies. Ooo."" It occurs to her to look around, and does a great job of blocking the stairs as she blinks, wide-eyed, at the goings-on.

R'tran waves to Jenna and M'yr as they arrive.

Another mating flight, another clutching -- and before long another hatching. Same ol', same ol'. Niklo just grins as her best friend pretty much bounces up the stairs of the gallery, shaking her head a little. ""I know, I know, Tziv!"" she laughs, ""An' yeah, first one here, but... can't be all that different from High Reaches, right?"" A small shrug.

Caitlyn scrambles in and up the steps, knuckle-rubbing at tired eyes still shadowed by sleep as she peers about to find a place to seat herself. Overhearing Nolee, the bluerider gives her a short wave, diverting steps to head in the junior goldrider's direction.

V'lano climbs to the seating tiers from the sands.

Griere climbs to the seating tiers from the sands.

From the sands, Volath emerges from the tunnel leading to the Weyrwoman's Weyr.

M'yr literally trots up the steps, thoroughly familiar with the steps under his feet and it shows. Beaming, he tugs Jenna along with him, waving widely to those he knows. ""Greetings from Fort Weyr, Istans!"" he calls out with that bright smile. ""Heya!"" A wave to R'tran is added also.

Jozell comes walking in slowly, his hands behind his back. He sighs slightly as he moves twords a place to sit.

Tzivya rolls her eye and gives Niklo a poke in the side, then grabs her hand to drag her towards the front of the galleries. ""This the same girl who spent how much time and energy looking for firelizard eggs? These are much grander! Besides, I love all the new people we get cause of them, new friends to be made!"" She finds a place for them and settles into a seat, though she is not remotely sitting still.

""I don't know why she waited so long,"" Griere grumbles, half to herself and half to V'lano as the pair make their way along the galleries. ""We're probably lucky that she didn't start dropping eggs on the ledge."" Despite her tone, there is a tease of a smile in the corner of her mouth, proof that she's excited about the clutch no matter how Aerianth might be going about it.

Jenna tags along after M'yr, absently adjusting her hair as she's tugged along, and letting M'yr do the formal greeting for the two of them. She's not really watching where she'd going, and M'yr's enthusiastic greetings insure he's not watching her steps either. As a result, she all but plows into Nolee, where the junior weyrwoman's stopped on the stairs with her bowl of cookies. ""Shells and shards! I'm /so/ sorry...""

Niklo laughs all the more at her friend, ""Leave it to you to think of it that way,"" she comments dryly, but her grin keeps it from being serious. Letting herself be dragged onward, she wrinkles her nose and adds, ""Besides! Firelizards are a lot easier to take care of, an' they don't make you go crazy like dragons do. They're worth the time and energy...""

""She beat me."" That's V'lano, speaking to the weyrwoman who accompanies him by one arm; the other arm carries a basket with yarn in it, or with something in it at any rate, little colorful lumps. And he nods to something on the other side of the crowd, something it's possible only he can see, something no doubt insignificant. And then, only then, does he start to get a sense for the number of -people- here, and really turn his attention to the matter at hand, and to Griere's remark. ""Maybe she's... shy."" Around that he twists a merry grin.

Kaelana ambles up the steps, quick on her feet, making sure to keep out of the way from swarming residents of the weyr. The glance given the stands by the queen elicit a faint squeak from the girl, a stumble imminant causing a small furrow in the flow of ascendants and a silent cursing from the man behind. A brusque apology is ofered before she scampers of towards a few familiar faces, twisting amoungst the earlier guests towards the front.

Nolee hails Caitlyn's sleepy wave with a wave of her own, tipping the full bowl in an offering to share. ""Careful, they're very fresh. I swiped them,"" she proudly announces, then oofs as the Fortian Weyrwoman near-collides with her, managing for once to retain her balance and to smile cordially to their Fortian visitors. ""Jays, you almost sat right on my lap!"" She squints, then ooos, recognizing her. ""Did you bring the little one? I've got cookies!""

Tannim settles himself into a seat off to the side of everyone else. He is watching the Queen with wide eyes evidently unaware of the gathering crowd about the stands.

Tzivya's head is darting hither and fro, bouncing lightly in her seat as she watches all the people streaming in to watch the clutching, and for the all-too-imminent eggs. When she spots Kaelana, she offers an energetic wave, ""Kae! Over here! Room for you with Nik and I!"" She looks back to Niklo, ""Do you mind if she sits with us? And they don't make you go insane! People just get insane as they grow up!""

Caitlyn manages to notice a few others, though her height puts her at a certain disadvantage in the growing throng, hopping up and down a couple of times to wave at Jenna and M'yr. Luckily, the woman manages to avoid the pileup of weyrwomen as Nolee and Jenna crash together, giving a rueful little smirk of wry humor to both of them as she pulls near. The duet of V'lano and Griere are given a jaunty, tossed mockery of a salute.

Potikanda watches the throng of people around her with wide eyes as she takes a seat close to the edge of the ledge. She wonders if anyone she knows will appear for the clutching.

From the sands, Aerianth wastes little time. She rumbles to Volath, a vocalization that starts out tender but turns strained as her body reminds her of the task at hand. She goes about looking for the area of the sands that seems right, pawing here and smoothing there, but the trembling grows stronger and it soon seems like just right where she is will just have to suffice.

Niklo plops down heavily beside Tzivya, amused at the older girl's excitement and energy. At the question she just shakes her head that she doesn't mind, though it's doubtful it would matter even if she objected. ""'Sides,"" the girl points out, ""Dragons make people *more* crazy than jus' old crazy!"" Sage nod.

Caitlyn peers down into the bowl Nolee offers, blinking thickly as she examines the contents. ""Huh? Wha?"" is her none-too-lucid reply - fingertip rubbing the sleep away from one eye's coner.

M'yr's hand is jerked from Jenna's, surprise registering as the grin fades to a distant smile. Trying a clearing of his throat, he is just about to reach out to steady Jenna, realizes she's still on her feet, then quickly avoids eye contact with either one. ""Cait! Where's Gus?? How have you been? It's been... Hey. Griere! V'lano! How good to see you both! And... eggs!""

Makeup Spill Egg
From the sands, A collage of color washes over this glowing orangey-tinted egg, leaving stripes of ocean's depths blue, wilting foliage brown and rouge-kissed red amid scribbles of feature-defining black curlicues. Smears and smudges mar any particular shape from standing out, instead resembling a spill across the egg by a rather limited artist's palette. The wider end of the egg even appears to have been stippled with a sponge, leaving a menagerie of hue and value to create the illusion of an artificial beard's waves and depths.

Jenna recovers from the pileup relatively well, muttering apologies as she does. ""No, it's past his bedtime, I'm afraid, Nolee."" She gives a belated wave and nod to R'tran, now that she's not in danger of falling on anyone. ""And Fort's duties,"" she offers around generally, with a rueful smile. She moves to a seat, glancing out at the sands. ""Looks like we made it in time,"" and with an amused smile at M'yr as she settles next to R'tran. ""He'll be like that until he settles down. He really should visit more. Then he'd babble less,"" she confides to her clutchmate.

Tannim finally tears his eyes from the sands for a moment to look around the stands and is somewhat surprised to see all the people assembled. He looks about for any familiar faces. He spots Niklo and Tzivya further up front and thinks twice about going to join them as the older one seems way to energetic for him at the moment. He looks about some more and not seeing anyone else he immediately recognizes goes back to raptly watching the now emerging eggs.

Nolee is all cheer and smiles, perhaps because it won't be her turn to sit out the next sevendays and beyond sitting the eggs on the hot hot sands. Unphased by Jenna's proximity or her presence, she shrugs sadly at the absent little she could've gotten sugared up, then smiles beyond to M'yr the shifty-eyed, then shrugs haplessly. ""It's cookies, Kintryth's. Hot ones. I swiiiped 'em. Oh! And Ista's duties, all around.""

From the sands, Volath's barely down onto the sands by the time that telling rumble speaks to him, by the time he realizes what his task here is meant to be. He pauses, one paw lifted like a hunting hound, muzzle pointed toward his queen. The telling ripples of her sides delay him further, but in a few moments he slinks out onto the sands, wings sleeked back, and begins -his- work: moving around with tail slowly swinging across the sand beneath him, laying fresh sand up for Aerianth's consideration.

Tzivya squeals as an egg makes an appearance, and her friends are utterly forgotten as her focus locks onto the ovoid object. ""Ohh! interesting colorings on that one! Nice and birght and cheerful, though those dark marks are worrisome, I guess?"" A shrug and a grin, and she squirms in her seat. ""See? Better'n any lizard egg!""

Kaelana seems all too pleased when one of her 'familiar faces' turns about and hails her over. Jumping over a few people, it seems she's more jumping over people then around, whether this happens to be the case or not. Arriving at the destination, she gives an effusie grin and sits down beside Tzivya with a small wave, seeing uncaring about the possible consternation her entrance may have caused for those behind. She,for once at least, makes no remark and gazes raptly over the sands at the newest arrival, eyes glimmering.

Caitlyn takes peripheral note of M'yr's vocalized welcome, giving the tall Fortian a wide, though still slightly bleary grin, calling back to him in a voice more fit for a larger person, ""Gus is in hiding, probably! And i've been swamped with my duties!""

""I can't imagine that anyone really wants an audience when something is being expelled from their body,"" Griere sniffs to V'lano. Thankfully that discussion is cut short by M'yr's greetings. The Istan Weyrwoman puts on a smile. ""M'yr, Jenna,"" she offers dutifully. ""Speaking of eggs, there's one now..."" The short woman presses to her toes, reaching out to use V'lano for balance as she tries to get a better view of the egg.

Jascela climbs into the stands well after the majority of the audience arrives. She carries a small blanket-wrapped bundle in her arms. She finds a seat well back from the sands and settles down to watch quietly.

Niklo grins, waving a bit at Kaelana heads over, but is quickly drawn back to the sands at Tzivya's squeal. ""Wha-- oh!"" She turns around fully and squints at the egg, trying to make out details. Then she shrugs. ""Colors are jus' colors. Don't mean nothin'."" A half smile. ""Pretty, but I still say no better than a firelizard's eggs!""

In the Spotlight Egg
From the sands, Dark enough to nearly be missed against the black Istan sands, this egg is only distinguishable by it's glossy sheen, and the bright white splotch at it's top. Like a beacon in the night, the white fades down across the shell, disappearing into the darkness at the egg's base. It's rather unremarkable besides the path of white, it's only other features being the rough texture and ovoid shape that define it as an egg.

M'yr takes note of where Jenna is, sends her a handsome smile, then turns to walk closer to Caitlyn. And Nolee. As he approaches them, handsome turns beaming, back to his initial expression when he arrived. ""Heya, Nolee. Good to see you."" is genuinely offered. ""You've been well? Oh, look! Another egg!""

Tzivya gapes at her friend. ""See? You're perfect for being a rider, you're already crazy! And you'll get scolded if the riders hear you saying that!"" But then the darker orb is there, and she is ohhhing again and looking with wide eyes. ""Lookit that one, Kae! Almost can't see it!""

R'tran sees Jascela arrive and quietly makes his way toward her, seating himself at her side with a rakish grin and a moment's coo at his new son.

""Weyrwoman."" That's V'lano, to Jenna, with a deep nod and deeper grin, dark eyes twinkling; let M'yr go on by and greet Nolee, and the Istan Weyrleader will somehow manage to overlook any better greeting for -him- than a glance and a grin before going back to fixing Jenna with that merry, too-pleased smirk. ""Such a pleasure."" Aside to Griere, just a waggle of brows: ""She's had a little practice at it by now. But this is more crowd than we've usually got, isn't it? And more - "" Back to Jenna, that smile. ""Varied.""

Nolee steps aside at last so the flow of visitors can progress more smoothly up the stairs to the tiers beyond, and she leans against the rail, relaxed for the moment. ""I have been! No stuffing in my nose or anything."" She looks him up and down appraisingly, then nods approvingly. ""Nice leathers! That's a very becoming color. Would you, ah, like a cookie?"" Caitlyn's given a re of the bowl as well, then she squints sandsward. ""Oh, really? I missed it -- where's it at? Jays, it's so ...white. Is it healthy?""

Niklo laughs at her friend, grinning wildly. ""Naw, s'exactly why I shouldn't be a rider! Jus' think how I'd be if I was crazier! Not good."" A wink at Tzivya, and then she blinks as another egg is suddenly on the sands. ""Shards, is that really an egg? You can barely see half of it!""

Jenna inclines her head to Griere and V'lano. ""I'd heard it was a good flight. And a clutching's always a welcome diversion."" She gives V'lano's feline-that-ate-the-wherry-chick look a warm grin of her own. ""I only wish I had more time to indulge in a longer visit. Niyath loves the heat.""

Stage Fright Egg
From the sands, Swirls and eddies of dusky brown and beige drift swiftly along and around the contours of this egg. The flowing whirlwind of shifting patterns accented even further by barren valleys and hills following the violent lines of motion. Buried partway in the black sands, this egg gives the illusion of a shimmering orb, its focus centered on whatever gaze wonders at it.

Jascela smiles over at R'tran as he joins her then carefully passes the bundle over to him. ""Want to hold him while he naps?""

Kaelana can't help but look across Tzivya at Niklo with a raised brow, the girls comment enough to assume what warrented it. She gives a small cough of disbelief before turning back to the sands, the sights and sounds of the cavern seeming a bit overwhelming. ""They're so pretty."" Is all she whispers back to Tzivya.


Late as usual, Zyllia hurries up to the gallery and takes a seat quickly, not wanting to interrupt anybody, and not wanting to miss more of the clutching than she has to. She finds a seat near the railing and smiles to those she knows, bobbing her head to those she doesn't.

M'yr accepts the offered cookie, tasting it approvingly after a glance down at his clothing. ""Thanks! Nice of you to say so. You're looking great! I miss the warm weather. It's too bad you were sick and couldn't join us when we came to visit."" Dark eyes flicker about the area, noticing R'tran and Jascela. ""Is that his child? I didn't realize..""

R'tran returns Jascela's smile, his eye meeting hers for a moment as he takes Celaran into his arms. He fumbles with the infant's receiving blanket, settling the child in his embrace.

Caitlyn gives a sudden, hard yawn as she regards Nolee and the arriving M'yr, shaking her head once to try and wake up more, her grin still plastered to her face. ""You speak the obvious, good Weyrleader,"" is her good-natured jibe just as he turn to speak to Jascela, her dark head then turning to Nolee to nod enthusiastically, fingers plucking out a couple of those cookies. ""Ah, thanks Nolee! I could use some sugar to wake me up..."" *munchmunchmunch* Cait, too, moves aside to allow more people by, taking a seat just next to the small, gathered group on the nearest stone seat.

Griere's slim brow is quick to cock at V'lano and Jenna and all those curious grins, a sidelong view catching the pair of them. Her fingers, still resting on Vel's arm, give him a quick squeeze and the she steps away to move a bit further down the aisle where she might be able to see Aerianth's newest accomplishments better.

Tzivya grins to Kaelana, ""Yes, they are! Always love seeing them, every one unique and beautiful. Never seen two that looked the same!"" She turns her gaze on Niklo with a laugh, ""You'd make a good greenrider, they're the craziest anyway!""

Jascela looks down toward M'yr and laughs quietly, nodding. ""I'm afraid he's the only one I can think of who could be the father."" She glances over at R'tran and grins as he takes the nearly newborn infant from her.

""Aerianth's flights have all been good."" And V'lano would be the expert, then, or lifemate to the expert, and feel no apparent need to be any kind of humble about it. He turns a nod toward Griere, focusing -her- in his too-pleased regard for a moment to add, ""It's my theory the weather here does something for our queens. Makes them spirited, among other things."" But the Istan Weyrwoman's off toward the rail, and he just nods after her to let her know he's marked her destination and might join her there soon, then looks back at Jenna. ""Small wonder, if I might be right, that Niyath would like the heat, then.""

G'tive makes his way up the steps, two full skins of wine hang over his shoulder while a large basket rests in the crook of one elbow. Nods and smiles are given as he makes his way through the crowd, acknowledging people but not stopping to chat. When he's finally in front of his Weyrleaders he stops, grins slightly, and slips open the lid to the basket to reveal quite the assortment of wine glasses. ""Either of you care for a glass? I've got a fruity red and a semi-sweet white.""

From the sands, Aerianth shifts about, turning to inspect the last egg and to nudge it a bit closer to the previous one. She mounds the dark, sparkling sand up around them, protective and cozy. With her wings low like shields, she finds the right spot to deposit the next one.

From the sands,
Overstuffed Wardrobe Egg
From the sands, A number of colors swath this lumpen shell, though it's dominated by antique creams, olives and drab burgundies. More noteworthy is the appearance of texture, as if this patch here - a sandy brown in hue - were shaped from rough canvas, while the patch beside it, dark blood-red, might have been fashioned from fine crushed velvet. Misshapen as it is, there's a sense of having been dashed together in a hurry about this poor egg, almost like a heap of clothes and fabrics were dumped in a pile, and the pile - inspired - took on the form of life.

R'tran casts a grin M'yr-ward, cupping the baby's head gently and raising it so that the Fort weyrleader can see his boy's face. ""M'yr, meet Celaran. Celaran, M'yr,"" he whispers, his voice heavily tinged with paternal pride.

Niklo just grins at Kaelana's look, giving a small shrug. But to Tzivya she replies, ""Yeah, right. An' maybe I'll Impress the dragon in that egg,"" a nod at the recent arrival on the sands, ""An' it'll be green, an' when she rises I'll drive everbody in the weyr crazy with my own craziness!"" Gesturing wildly, she suddenly remembers how many people are here and bites her lip, shutting up and putting her hands on her lap. ""Ahem.""

Nolee smiles warmly and nods, her large brown eyes earnest. ""I was mad at you then, too, but I'm more happy for you now,"" she states in her simple, oblivious manner. Her gaze follows his and she oohs. ""Good idea, sweetening's just the thing to clear the sleep. Oh, that's right. She had a little one, Caity, did you know? Is that one of your riders, M'yr?"" Yay, gossip! She looks over R'tran, then at the baby, then at other unfamiliar-ish faces, fascinated more by the crowd than by the eggs.

Another egg, another squeal - Tzivya is slowly creating a cleared space around her and her friends as people try not to be at ground zero of her excitement. ""Ohh, I like that one! Very colorful! I like the ones with lots of different colors on them more than the ones that are all one or two colors. Which do you like best so far, Nik?""

Jenna smirks faintly at V'lano. ""Well, you'd have to go all the way back to Kyriath to find Istan blood in Niyath, she's more Igen and Fort stock. Spirited... well, that's more her rider, I'm afraid. She's my calming influence,"" she trails off and nods towards the sands and the next egg.

Moving past, Griere overhears Niklo's proposals and turns to eye the young girl. The weyrwoman's cool eyes flick over her with a displeased expression, but as the eggs keep coming Griere doesn't linger for long.

From the sands,
Tulle on the Twirl Egg
From the sands, This egg is covered entirely with a fine web-work of tulle. Pale, whisper pinks layer over soft ivories in a decidedly airy and feminine arrangement. The delicate laces gather densely here and ruffle into each other there and seem, in general, to be twisting upward towards a white apex as if the whole egg were frozen in the midst of spinning.

M'yr reaches in to grasp a glass from Gus, klinking it against another on the way out of the basket. ""Drink with you, Gus? Absolutely!"" To celebrate that, he lifts the empty glass high and nods emphatically. ""So how's V'lano treating you as his Second?"" In a lower voice, he leans toward G'tive and whispers with a grin, ""He was my best teacher, you know. Or at least the only one who'd put up with me!"" Straightening, he catches Nolee's smile, returning it. ""I'm glad, Noles. And yes, that's R'tran. Heya, Celaran! Well met! R'tran, he's a fine lad. Congratulations!""

Kaelana gives a little shake, her eyes losing the glazed expression she had so recently adopted, her lips curving up at the corners to form a excited little grin. Turning to Tzivya, an eye still trained on the sands, ""I wouldn't know, don't get to see many clutchings. But I'll believe you this time."" She lets out a little laugh and says across to Niklo teasingly, ""But who'd notice the difference?""

Caitlyn overhears Tzivya's comment about greenies as she chomps those cookies, abruptly spitting a small spray of crumbs as she chokes and sniggers at it. A slightly askew look is momentarily given to Niklo, golden-brown eyes once more settling on her companions. A small, rather surprised shake of head to Nolee, then to Jascela - followed by a smaller grin. ""No, i've been so busy, i've not kept up with much of anything! Congratulations, Jas.""

Niklo doesn't notice the negative looks she gets from her little outburst of sarcasm, just wrinkling her nose at Tzivya and shrugging. ""I dunno, I like the ones with jus' a few colors. Seem more organized. But none really caught my attention so far..."" The very pink egg that appears next gets a mock-gag from her, ""'Specially not that one.""

Jascela smiles down at Caitlyn and nods to her, swinging her always-present huge earrings against her neck. ""Thank you, Caitlyn."" She glances over at R'tran, watching protectively.

""Then bring her for a nice long visit some time,"" murmurs V'lano, voice deep and rich just now, just for this. He turns, following Jenna's nod, to (supposedly) look out over the sands. But still he speaks to the Fortian Weyrwoman in that rumbly tone: ""I'm sure the distance from your duties could provide calm if she chose to take a break from it. - Oh - "" As if he's just realized something. The Weyrleader lifts his head, sending a gaze out across the crowd. ""I need to go round up a runaway."" Timing is everything. ""You'll excuse me?""

From the sands,
Dramatic Mask Egg
From the sands, A dark and foreboding egg lies separated from the rest. It rests deep in the sands, as if it wishes to escape from view. The base color of the egg is an intense black, darker even than the sands it hides in. However, on the side facing up is a bright white oval with eye-shaped 'holes' in it, making it seem like a large mask has been forgotten out on the sands.

Tzivya, in contrast to Niklo's gag at the bright pink egg, gives a much louder - and more piercing - squeal. ""Ohh! Pink! I love pink! Not as nice as purple, mind you, but definately mmy second favourite color!"" And another egg hot on it's heals. ""Ohh, and that one just looks menacing! That's /gotta/ be your green, Nik!""

Jenna nods politely to V'lano, lips curving in an understanding smile. ""Of course, Weyrleader. In case we don't speak later - it looks like it's shaping up to be a lovely clutch.""

Nolee nods to M'yr's introduction and she scoots into a row, leaning back to admire the baby from a pretty good distance, smiling politely, supressing an 'ugh' face then getting hollered at for blocking the view, Nolee finally squishes her ample backend between a few other people to make a spot for herself in the rows of people. ""I wrote about the baby being born in my records. Hope I spelt his name right."" Her gaze follows the squeal as she winces, then she supresses a retort by stuffing a warm melty cookie in her own mouth.

Niklo just laughs, shaking her head at Tzivya's new squeal. ""I should've guessed..."" she sighs, still grinning. But her expression visibly brightens as she spots the newst egg, a look of consideration crossing her face. ""Well,"" the girl admits after a moment or two, ""That one ain't bad at all. I like the dark ones.""

Griere seems to have found herself a good spot to view the new eggs, though she does look towards V'lano in regular, idle glances. But she's still within earshot of Niklo and Tzivya and whoever may be sitting near them. It makes her let out a big sigh.

G'tive laughs as M'yr grabs one of the glasses out, mock threatening to snap the lid closed on his fingers. ""Hey, no breaking those, I had to wrestle them out of the kitchen."" Another glass is removed and set on a seat nearby so that Gus can fill it p easily, then offering to fill the glass in the Fortian 'Leader's hand. ""White or red? And Vel, he treats me well, if you don't count him constantly trying to give me a heartattack. How's Fort treating you? Finding any extra grey hairs yet?""

""They always do,"" purrs V'lano. ""I'm so glad you've come to see."" And then he's off, around and up the aisle, behind most of the crowd, across toward the very end rail, where there's a small golden firelizard playing balance-on-toes on the wood.
Currently she's got her tail up and wings windmilling, like she might fall. She squeaks a peep when the Weyrleader scoops her so unceremoniously up and deposits her in the basket he's carrying, but that ends his 'round-up' and afterward he wanders down to a spot with a better view, nodding at newly entered spectators along the way.

From the Rafters Egg
From the sands, A band of latticed darkness wraps around this egg, the glows of the cavern shining on it giving the illusion of bright lights hanging below it. Staring too long at the surface may give one a sense of vertigo; shadows and shapes meld together and take form, giving a sense of depth as though yards lay beneath the dark band. A sea of dots that could be faces stretch out and disappear under the sands that nestle the egg and a stage takes the center, it's glossy wood floor waiting for the cast emerge.

M'yr's other hand reaches into the basket to pull out another glass, laughing at the Istan Second's attempt to catch his hand. ""Red for me!"" he replies quickly then glances over his shoulder toward Jenna. ""How about you, Jen? Red? White?"" A rakish smile comes. ""Both? If you get white, you can have some of mine to taste both."" Temporarily snared by the newest egg, he grins broadly. ""I do like the darkness of /that/ egg!""

Tzivya laughs and nods, ""Well, good you like it then!"" Still, as the eggs pile up, some of her enthusiasm does wane; the approaching finish is already weighing on her. ""But still, they are /all/ nice. Just some are nicer than others!"" She glances at Nik sidelong, ""You know I like pink! How could I not? Babies are pink! Well, some of them, but still!""

From the sands, Aerianth swings around to greet her new children with a wuffle of breath that blows grains of sand onto the wet eggs, glittering the shells and pools of goo with little black fleck. She looks to Volath, lifting her head proudly, but she barely has time for more before another wave of muscle ripples along her flanks.

Jenna considers M'yr for a long moment, and then rises to prowl to him. ""White. I always prefer the white. But yes, I'll claim a bit of your red."" Distractedly, she glances out at the sands. ""How many eggs so far?"" The question is put to all available ears.

G'tive obediently pours a glass of red and one of white for M'yr. He switches the wine on the chair for the basket and repositions the skins to the other shoulder, seemingly for comforts sake. A sip, a grin, and a sigh; must be good stuff. Looking over the rafter gets pursed lips. ""I dunno, maybe a little blotchy or something...""

Kaelana probably isn't the only one wincing at the girl beside hers squeal. No comment is forthcoming however a pained smile in Tzivya's direction is her tactful way of sending on a hint. While the even -does- stretch on, she props up her elbows on her kness and leans on her knuckles, eyes glazing over yet again.

From the sands, With so much of the sands lain bare and fresh-turned for his queen to peruse, Volath has a moment to return his queen's look with one considerably less arch. It might be considered affectionate, even, and that impression's doubled by his approach and gentle whuffle at her foreshoulder, careful to keep clear of the eggs freshly placed before her.

As her lifemate keeps moving around the sands, Griere is forced to move, too. She turns to offer a smile to the girls she's been eavesdropping on, perhaps a slightly warmer smile for the compliments she's overhead. But then she's slipping back towards Jenna. ""It seems to be progressing quickly,"" she says offhand, eyes mostly on the sands.

From the sands,
Discarded Bubblegum Egg
From the sands, While this egg retains the proper ovoid shape of an egg, it's texture and color seem to be trying to fool the eye into seeing it as a more shapeless blob. A dull pink that is tinged with grey, the surface of the egg seems to have a sticky, malleable quality to it. Smaller than the average egg, it lurks amongst some of its brethren as if waiting for someone to accidentally discover it.

Caitlyn hasn't given the arrival of Aerianth's eggs much thought, as of now - distracted by the company about her - people she hasn't seen much (or any) of in months. The lurid pink of the newly arrived ovoid, however, captures the short woman's attention...and Cait gives the thing a frank appraisal and a small sound. ""Ugh!""

Amira hurries to the galleries, looking all the time at the sands. She spies Tzivyaand hurries toward her. ""What have I missed?"" she asks, still looking at the sands.

Nolee realizes belatedly that she's stolen someone else's spot, as the round-bellied woman returns, holding her back in pain, and Nolee makes a little oops face and makes room by moving down the way, ending up someplace just behind the squealers and the suffering Kaelana. ""Want a cookie?"" she whispers to the latter, foisting out the bowl. ""Good for earache."" She made that up.

""Well, I know you."" That's V'lano, at Tzivya; his lazy saunter along the rail takes him to a spot from which she's visible. ""And you."" That's for Niklo. And then he glances down at the basket (queen-covered) in his hand; then back up, perhaps significant, at the girl. Then he puts an elbow on the rail and leans, one foot crossing the other at the ankle, half-listening to or watching the young women, half attentive to the sands.

From the sands,
Opening Night Jitters Egg
From the sands, Flickers and flecks of exuberant colors - red, yellow, green, brown - skitter across the shell of this largish egg. No one hue stands out from the others to provide a moment's rest for the eyes or jangled nerves. Instead each new shade - ruby, olive, violet, fawn - simultaneously blends into and sparks against the next with an eager excitement.

Tzivya returns Griere's smile with one of her own, excitement for the woman's dragon clear in her expression. Her gaze is drawn to V'lano then as he speaks to them, and she lets that smile grow to include him. ""Weyrleader."" She says, excited voice still managing something approachcing politeness. THen Amira is speaking and she is distracted, grinning to her, ""Eggs! Bunches of them, all lovely! Well, not sure about that second pink one, seems a bit... Squishy... But the rest are nice!""

Jenna nods to Griere. ""Niyath's last one was like that. Not like the pass,"" she flashes a quicksilver smile at the other Weyrwoman, ""with twenty, thirty eggs.""

The whispered comment breaks Kaelana's self-induced intermission, only able to respond with the ever graceful, ""Huh?"" Her brain quickly sorts through the question and the mask of confusion flows off for one of ,perhaps forced, gratitude, ""Yes, Thank you."" And a hand is extended to take a small one, the girl nibbling on it apathetically.

Amira nods, still standing and looking out at the sands. ""How many do you think there are?"" She calms down and looks around for a seat. ""I would have gotten here sooner, but I didn't find out for a while. I was working in the Resident Dorm.""

Niklo grins back at Griere, a bit sheepishly, and then tries to disappear into her seat in embarrassment as she realizes exactly who had been watching her rather exhuberant antics. However, she can't help but giggle a little at Tzivya, wrinkling her nose. ""What, you don't like that one?"" a gesture to the odd pinkish egg, ""It's pink! And actually... it looks the same shade of pink a baby is."" Her grin brightens, then fades abruptly as she catches sight of V'lano, becoming a friendly smile instead. ""'Ello, Weyrleader."" A polite nod accompanies this.

""Nine or ten?"" Griere answers Jenna, her brow creasing as she tries to get a count. ""She doesn't seem done yet. Should be a decently sized clutch, I think."" That last part is mused mostly to herself. ""It seems like most queens have been producing little more than a dozen lately. How many were in Niyath's last?""

""Uh."" Tzivya replies to Amira, ""I didn't een think to count! Maybe ten or twelve so far? A good sized clutch, at any rate!"" She looks over to Niklo, ""And it's the right color, but I dunno. It looks like it's melting, and eggs shouldn't melt, cause they're eggs and supposed to get /harder/.""

M'yr leaves Jenna to her discussion with Griere, though he does wiggle his fingertips free of the glass he holds to wave them toward her before taking a few steps toward V'lano. ""Dashing collection of eggs Volath has sired, my friend! Soldreth feels he's a kind of uncle, in a way.""

Nolee stuffs another cookie in her own mouth, munching contentedly in a vague companionship with her fellow cookie-consumer. Then there's Amira, talking about work, of all things. She makes a face, swallows the cookie down hard. ""Ugh, work,"" she manages, licking her lips and trying in vain to swallow all the cookie bits with her throat dry. ""If you weren't so good at it, you wouldn't have to do so much,"" is her cheery advice to Amira, then she frowns at the squishy pink egg. ""Is that one healthy? It looks smushed.""

From the sands,
In the Pit Egg
From the sands, Despite the shroud of darkness covering this egg, action is not entirely hidden from sight. Hints of color can still be seen; the muted skin-tone arrow of a cellist's bent arm points upward, several irregular spots of white cover the middle, fine shirts under black suit jackets. Just below the bent arm a reddish-brown glow of dark wood, caught in the light of a stage light can be seen, and a three-quarter turn reveals bright patches of brass.

R'tran ooohs in appreciation of the latest egg.

Caitlyn manages to sneak fingers over into Nolee's cookie basket, and snags a couple more of them, grinning at the other woman as she then lets her gaze rove over the growing arrangement of eggs. ""Hmm, there's lots of black and white...and PINK in this clutch,"" she observes, rolling her eyes a little. ""Only brighter colors in variety I've seen so far are on *that* one..."" the bluerider gestures to 'Night Jitters' egg.

Toril sneaks in amid the oohs and ahs and chatter, looking for a good vantage point. With a few muffled ""'Scuse me...sorry...beg pardon...""-type comments, she wedges herself into a spot and shrugs out of her jacket, surreptitiously absorbing the warmth of the gallery. ""They beat poultry eggs all hollow,"" she comments.

""Couldn't say,"" V'lano says to Amira, then a nod to Tzivya's effort at a count. Niklo gets a warmer smile, and a less merry-mischief one - though that one comes back right quick, mind you, when M'yr's address breaks through the flirting to find its target. ""Oh, does he? I think this will be our best clutch yet, though don't let Gus hear me say so. For that matter, don't let Soldreth hear me say so!"" A wink for that gest, even, and a good chance to miss out on Nolee's use of the word, 'smushed.'

Jenna takes her glass from M'yr, her expression faintly distracted as she responds to Griere, ""Twelve. I was surprised it was that many, but Soldreth did very well. I think the most she ever laid was thirty three."" She rolls her eyes faintly. ""/That/ was chaotic on hatching day,.""

Niklo giggles at her friend's description of the strange pink egg, ""Well, I don't think it's actually meltin'. I mean, they look like all sortsa things, but they just look that way. Doesn't mean they are that way!"" She considers for a moment, shen shrugs. ""'Sides, I think their momma'd react if there was somethin' wrong with it... don't you?""

Amira looks quickly at Nolee and smiles. ""Sorry, Ma'am. I can't help it. I'll try though."" She looks down at the latest egg. ""That's an interesting one.""

Kaelana refrains from commenting on the healthiness of the clutch, really having no clue herself. Instead, the cookie is given rapt attention and seemingly enjoyed immensely. She looks out over the sands, eye's looking over each egg with interest, the expected end enough to bring back the spark of excitment.

M'yr laughs, nodding as he lifts his glass in a non-verbal toast to V'lano, ""I won't tell him you said that."" His elbow juts out, slowly heading toward the Istan Weyrleader's ribcage for a light impact. ""You and Griere are doing well? It does seem like it..""

From the sands,
A Thousand Burning Lamps Egg
From the sands, The most obvious thing about this medium-sized egg is, inescapably, its shine. It glows from every angle, each glance yielding a new glare of brilliance, as if myriad crystals hang from golden wires among a thousand burning lamps, each filled with amber oil. Darker spots of burnt umber or warm shadow grays appear and disappear among the light, reflecting the black of the sands nearby, especially around the top of the shell. These mock-shadows create a sense of depth, suggesting a structure not solid, but made of many complex parts - like a chandelier, ready for glorious hanging.

Nolee tips her head, considering Amira's words, and the overheard ones from Niklo thoughtfully. ""Nalaieth keeps secrets, though,"" she murmurs. ""I bet Aerianth does too, when she wants to. But maybe a sick egg would be enough reason to tell."" This musing softly voiced, Nolee goes back to people watching -- after all, the eggs will be there for ages and ages. ""Learning to rest is just as important as learning to work,"" she tells Amira sagely, with only a slight giggle on the end. Then a disheartened sigh. ""Another white one.""

""Well, yeah, I guess so, but still. I guess it /is/ pink..."" But her attention is drawn in by the new egg, with wide eyes, ""Ohh, see, now there's a pretty egg! That will draw attetnion, you can be sure!"" She giggles and gives a loud clap of her hands in excitement. ""It's a lovely clutch, no matter how many colors it does or doesn't have!"" [Tzivya]

Toril squints down at the unexpected brightness of the newest egg, lips pursing in a silent whistle. ""Are they s'posed t'*glow* like that? Or has th'queen been eatin' odd herdbeasts?""

""Thirty three,"" Griere says with an appreciative breath. ""I cannot even fathom how uncomfortable that must have been for her. Aerianth's belly only starts to get really cumbersome just before she clutches. I'd imagine with thirty three would be quick a nightmare.""

Niklo looks toward Nolee as she comments about golds -- she would, after all, know these things. Looking a bit concerned at the prospect of something truly being wrong with the egg, she bites her lip for a moment. ""But surely she'd tell someone if there was somethin' wrong... I mean, that's important, ain't it?"" Sighing, she just shakes her head and turns back to the sands, spotting the new egg that Tzivya thinks is so nice. And this time she can't help but agree. ""That one *is* lovely. It's so... bright? Stands out real nice on the dark sand, don't it?"" A bit of a smile.

Script Egg
From the sands, The nearly white, matte surface of this rather large egg is liberally peppered with semi-glossy, midnight characters of every seeming shape and size - a veritable field of nonsense words and symbols penned by some unknown hand. As one more closely studies this ovoid for any semblance of meaning to the calligraphy. Whatever work this egg brought forth upon its smooth surface, unfortunately remains hidden and indistinct - subject to individual interpretation and the whims of light and the moment.

The ribbing is taken as lightly as M'yr meant it - but V'lano transfers the basket containing the now-drowsing firelizard and the balls of yarn into his other hand in preparation to clear an elbow to come back at the Fortian weyrleader. ""We are doing marvelously, my friend, I assure you. I've invited your weyrwoman for a rester here, though, should she like to take the time. Perhaps you could convince her, if you were to come along with - ?"" Now there's an invitation M'yr might never have expected.

Jenna confides softly to Griere, ""Niyath was an absolute terror to live with. I'm /so/ glad that's behind us. The smaller clutches are easier to manage. Easier on the staff too.""

Toril smiles sidelong at Niklo. ""Won't be too hard t'find come Hatching Day, will it? That dark one might get lost, but everyone'll be circlin' around that one, hpoin' for a sparkly glowin' dragon.""

Nolee nods Niklo's way; no need to alarm the girl, after all. ""Sure, yeh, sure!"" she enthuses. ""After all, M'yr's Soldreth's egg looked terrible sick. Like a rotted out wherry egg. And he turned out fine! Well,"" she takes on a momentary look of consternation, ""Mostly fine.""

Kamia slips in quietly, rubbing her hands on her apron, having rushed to finish some work and get to see the hatching, but still late and frazzled looking.

""And easier in the barracks once they hatch,"" Griere adds. ""Weyrlinghood is difficult enough without sixty beings all breathing and snoring away all night. Perhaps if there had been twelve eggs when I impressed, I'd have had a better chance of sleeping as a weyrling."" That doesn't really convince her though. She cranes her neck to watch the latest egg for a moment and then turns back to Jenna. ""It is good of you to come. You should visit more often.""

Tzivya grins and bounces more, the prettier egg restoring some of her spirits from the more drab balck and white eggs. She grins over at Toril, ""Yeah, it'll be fun to watch when the hatching comes! Looks lke it will be a good one this time, too! Lots of nice eggs, and lots of bets to place!""

M'yr's brow arches, curious smile playing at his lips. ""Well, I just might take you up on that!"" Another tilt of his glass in silent toast given to his friend, then his attention turns to Nolee. Seems the word 'Soldreth' caught his attention. ""It was a rotted green color, with these horrid bumps all over it!""

Niklo grins at Toril's comment nearby, nodding vigorously. ""I'd bet my money on a metallic there, for sure!"" the girl replies, then pauses. ""If... I had any."" A shrug. ""Oh well...""

From the sands,
Powdered Wig Egg
From the sands, Curls and tufts and clouds of white swirl into a melange of whites; bluish white, saffron white, tufted white, gray-flecked white; all these and more wait to trick the eye. This egg is where the pure unfettered blanched hues meet the dirty messy flecks of powder that seem to speckle this egg from top to curled, er, rounded, bottom. It almost looks as though this one is wearing a precariously balanced powdered white wig, resting on the peach-toned shade of the egg below the pristine white canvas.

Kaelana tries to ignore the conversation about her involving a possible sickish dragon, though a faint look of worry tinges her features. She instead looks down at the last two eggs, both seeming to garner her interest more then the rest combined. She breathes out slowly, trying to nudge Tzivya, murmuring, ""Look at -that- one."" Of course she doesn't specify, but it probably doesn't make too much difference either way.

Caitlyn chortles at Nolee's remembrance of Soldreth's egg - the circumstance much prior to Cait coming to Ista. ""I remember Kint's egg looked angry...but with that perfect, serene jewel floating inside it... Just like me."" Seems like she too is reminiscing.

Jenna chuckles to Griere. ""It's a conspiracy. V'lano was just saying the same thing. I admit, it /is/ tempting. Ista's a wonderful place to visit.""

""Bet when y'got marks,"" Toril advises Niklo cheerfully. ""'Till then, just make a lot of guesses, then tell everyone when they hatch that y'knew it all along. That's worked for m'brother a time or three."" She resists the urge to watch the Wig egg and see if it tips over. ""Hope I'll be here t'see if you're right when th'Hatchin' comes.""

""You're always welcome,"" Griere adds. ""Of course, V'lano and I have not been to Fort nearly as often as she should, either,"" she admits. She spots the latest egg from the corner of her eye and double takes. ""And there's the gray one,"" she says with a sigh.

Nolee tries to join the reverie, looking thoughtful and distant for a moment, all wispy-eyed. ""Nalaieth's looked...like an egg. I don't remember its outside. But I remember the inside!"" Thoughtful a moment, she regards the white egg, then shakes her head. ""Three white ones! At least Nalaieth's had some color."" Let's just not mention the short, low flight and the small clutch there either, eh? ""It makes you wonder, doesn't it? How much they match what's on the outside, and how much they don't?""

""Soldreth's egg - "" V'lano turns alongside M'yr now, to face Nolee, a grin crooked on his mouth. ""I couldn't say. It was interesting."" Now his chance to elbow his former 'second in the ribs, a little more soundly than he was elbowed at first.

Tzivya laughs, ""Yeah, always a few people who say they knew what everything would be! But they never do, it's all just guessing in the end. Still and all, they are lovely, if monochromatic!"" Ohh, big word. ""Can't be many more coming, though, after all clutches should be pretty small, right?""

Red Velvet Swag Egg
From the sands, It's a large, solid egg, with a shell that undulates slightly across its big broad sides. The color might make it look more dominating, too; it is an undeniably red egg, a rich, dark velvety shade of dense pile and glistening sheen. The combination of rubies and wine and that odd uneven shell gives the hues a gathered look, like material strung up in luxurious swags.

Caitlyn smiles up at her friend, nodding, and chortling softly at Nolee. ""Yeah, i've wondered about that, too. And yes, Nala's were very colorful! A painter's pallate-worth."" As she again peruses he eggs visually, Cait's head quirks to the side, level brown gaze giving Aerianth's offspring the once-over.

M'yr's hand instinctively grabs at the offending elbow still connected to his friend - perhaps not for long? Quick laughter overtakes him, the wine sloshing in the glass so much he downs it quickly. ""All right, wine is finished, time to go home!""

Niklo grins wildly at Toril's advice, head bobbing. ""Good plan!"" she agrees, glancing at Tzivya, ""Hear that? I bet a metallic in that egg."" A nod. ""And... a blue in that one."" A finger points to the prominantly white egg that was brought forth. But then she sighs and nods, starting to add to what the other girl said when she spots the newest egg on the sands. ""Oh!"" the girl exclaims instead, ""Look at that! How beautiful! What a gorgeous shade."" A pause and she sighs heavily, ""That one's my favorite, Tziv. For sure. Shards, what a beauty.""

Jenna arches an eyebrow at Griere, as she takes a sip of her wine. After she swallows, ""Gray one? I take it there's one in each clutch?""

Kamia watches quietly, edging her way up into a corner to watch the clutch, tilting her head abit.

From the sands, Aerianth lets out a relieved heave of a sigh and stretches from neck to tail before she is ready to give her happy new family their first survey in full. She nudges the last of the eggs, gently grouping them all together, along with some extra slopes of sand, and then settles down beside them and warbles happily at her mate.

Nolee sighs a moment, recalling that the last one on Ista's sands was just so, rather small. Then she's remembered the cookies, and has polished off another one of them, her expression turning toward that of one who has overdone it with the sweets as she swallows hard and tries to pass the bowl off to anyone who will take it.

Zyllia slips out, having had her fill of egg watching for the time being.

""Troublemaker,"" V'lano sidelongs to M'yr, but the word - low and chastising as it might be - is fond. Distance, you know, makes the heart grow fonder, or at least makes the fingers less inclined to try to wring a rival's neck. Then he's shifting around M'yr (trying to steer clear of retaliatory elbows) to reapproach his Weyrwoman, and the Fortian one as well. Because he's overheard... ""If there's only one in -this- clutch that's right unfortunate. Volath might be losing his touch.""

Tzivya ohhhhs in awe and nods with Niklo, ""I might have to agree with you there, Nik. That's got a lovely hue to it, reminds me of some of the drinks down at the Sandbar. And compared to the others, it really stands out, doesn't it? It's like the others are there just to make it look good!""

The rich, resplendant red egg *does* finally give Caitlyn her first cause to emit a deep sigh of wonder, ""Ooh, that one's lovely...""

Amira has found a seat, but simply sits quietly and unabtrusably in it, looking over the eggs and listening to the other girls' chatter. ""There's some color for you,"" she says to Tzivya and Niklo, nodding toward the latest egg. ""I think that's all."" She falls silent, still looking at the eggs she missed earlier.

""In Volath's at least. I guess Josilina blamed him for the gray one that Lliannoth had when Volath sired,"" Griere explains. ""Or I think that's how the story goes. And there has been at least one in each of ours. Soldreth came from one. that was an odd egg. We were all relieved when Soldreth came out with all his limbs intact. I'd rather hoped maybe it was a fluke, but... it's seeming to be a trend just as Josilina predicted."" Griere gives a shrug and then catches sight of her lifemate settling in. ""Oh, she appears done.""

Kaelana, oddly, notices the weyrwomans predicament and offers a hand to take the offending bowl away. She offers a sweet little smile, gaze half on the matter at hand and half roving the crowd to gather information for what ever reason she has. Her surveying happens upon Amira and a friendly wave is given with her other hand, a cordial smile given.

M'yr attempts a whooshing palm, aimed at V'lano's side, his own being the playfulness of one who is fond of the other. Smacking both hands together, he places his glass down on one of the benches, casually making his way toward Jenna and the Istan leaders. ""I wasn't kidding. At least not then. Unfortunately I do need to return back to Fort. It's been a pleasure. So good to be back. Thank you.""

Niklo just grins like a fool, obviously pleased with what appears to be the last egg of the clutch. ""Perfect!"" she tells the other girls nearby, ""What a perfect ending, eh? All those plain-ish eggs, and then... then *that* one!"" A shiver of excitement, and she giggles at Tzivya. ""Fine. I've never seen a firelizard egg I liked as much as that one. You win.""

Jenna's head jerks back to look at the sands, making a tally. ""Fourteen. Very goodly sized clutch. and Niyath's last was so colorful, I'd have liked to see some gray ones in there. Though,"" she casts a speculative glance at M'yr, ""I'd like to hear more about Soldreth's egg being.. unusual. Like M'yr though,"" she says louder, ""I also should be getting back.""

Toril counts rapidly, managing not to count the sparkly egg or the rich red egg twice. ""Fourteen. M'mum says that's not bad, for an Interval. An' if we make any bets on them, we maybe won't lose *all* our marks.""

Caitlyn pipes up as she overhears the Fortian leaders, ""Hey, good to see you, M'yr, Jenna! Fair Skies! And don't be strangers, hear?!"" A broad wave and a flashing, even grin are given to the pair.

Tzivya grins and hops to her feet as the event comes to a clear end. ""A great size! And /I/ don't plan to lose any marks! I'll get them all right!"" She grins to her friends, ""And Nik, don't think I won't remind you of that! Now, we should hurry out cause there's always really good food after these, and if you wait too long the really yummy stuff is gone before you get to it!""

Nolee smiles gratefully Kaelana's way. ""Thanks! Should've grabbed an older bowl of them; the fresh ones are too hard to resist."" Passing off the bowl leaves her free to wave in an unladylike but exuberant manner to Jenna and M'yr as they prepare for departure. She echoes Caitlyn's words with, ""Yep, don't be strangers! And bring the little one so he can have cookies!""

Griere puts on her gracious hostess smile. ""And I should be getting down to the sands. ""Thank you again for coming,"" she says to Jenna, turning to include M'yr in that. Her eyes then seek out V'lano and the tip of her curly head hints that it's time for them to check on their lifemates and get a good look at the new eggs from up close.

V'lano is almost, not quite, unaffected by that whooshing palm. He manages not quite to cough, and recovers with a merry grin, bending just enough to put down the basket with the lizard in it by his foot. ""Jenna, it's been a pleasure,"" he rolls out, rich and low, straightening and putting out a hand to offer for hers. ""Bring him back some time. Like I offered, if you have time, maybe."" Brows up, eyes bright and dark. Sparkle. And then, icing on the cake, a glance snuck at Griere, as if he's crafty.

Amira catches Kaelana's wave out of the corner of her eye and smiles to her. ""You go on, Tzivya. I'm going to make sure I look at the ones I missed."" She waves at the cheerful girl

Niklo laughs and nods vigorously. ""Agreed! I've seen enough clutchings and hatchings -- I should do pretty good this time!"" The girl grins assuredly and gets to her feet as well, to follow her freind. ""Alright, food sounds great about now. Real good!""

Toril looks really, truly wistful at the mention of food. ""I've got t'find th'Headwoman and make m'self known,"" she says regretfully. ""Once I find a bunk t'tuck my bag under, maybe I can come back an' try some of that stuff."" Perhaps she might make herself known here. ""M'name's Toril--da's a guardsman up at 'Reaches Hold, mum's a bluerider at 'Reaches Weyr. Happy t'be here, and t'meet you all."" She bobs something like a curtsey in the Weyrleaders' direction, then hurries out.

Tzivya grins to Amira with a nod. ""Aye! Imagine we'll all spend some times getting better looks at them, once things quiet down. We'll save you a seat though, so look for us when you come in, ok?"" She grins and turns, ""C""mon Nik! Best bubblies are out now!""

M'yr catches Griere's smile, that gesture not unusual to him, chuckling to himself before clearing his throat. ""V'lano, we should toss down a few at the bar sometime soon and remember old times, hmm? Fare well both of you, and congratulations on the new eggs!"" An arm is held out to Jenna, smile sent to Nolee and Caitlyn. ""Good to see you again, Noles and Cait.""

Jenna crosses palms with V'lano, smiling, ""I'll do my best."" She takes M'yr's arm and offers, ""Good night everyone. Thank you all for your hospitality.""

R'tran waves to Jenna and M'yr as they depart.

Saluting, Niklo grins and moves to follow her friend out off to the living cavern for food. ""Yes ma'am!"" she replies, ""Bubblies, ahoy!"" And the two girls wind their way through the crowd quick as they can, trying to beat the rush. Hopefully.

"event","9    Griere            Tue Dec 12 12:37 2006 Gold in Flight, One Crazy Night

In the dead of night, Aerianth blooded her feast and only Volath was witness. By the time the other dragons of the Weyr woke to realize what was going on, Aerianth was taking to the sky, leaving a number of confused riders standing in their pjs staring out into the night after their lifemates' hasty departures. 

To make the turn of events even more unusual, neither Griere nor V'lano were anywhere to be found! A brave soul reported that they were not in their weyr even though a handful of people had seen them leave the Sandbar, supposedly heading home. The chasers' lifemates waited with added anxiety to think that their dragon could win with the weyrwoman herself absent. 

The flight concluded with Volath as victor and the two dragons were later seen returning to their weyr with their riders astride. By the following morning, rumors were running wild in the caverns. Had V'lano secreted the weyrwoman away in an effort to secure his position? Was this Griere's way of refusing any other partner? Do either have any explanation of their whereabouts? While it seems a sheepish V'lano might be available for questions, Griere is, as always, to be approached at your own risk.

On an OOC note... Write some eggies! The theme this time around is ""On the Stage"". What does this mean? Anything that has to do with theater can be turned into an egg description. Spotlights, audience faces, chorus lines, make-up... You name it! We're looking for descriptions of 4-6 lines by December 27th. Please include your inspiration when you send them to Griere and V'lano. We can't wait to see what you come up with! :D

"event","<lj-cut text=""A half-turn after arriving at Ista, Niklo finally ventures out and meets a bronzerider on the beach."">
Settled into the dark sand of the beach, though well away from the water, a small figure sits bent over something intently. Nearby is a water-tight basket with a cold stew of water and flexible reeds, and every so often a hand darts away from the child's lap to dip into it, pulling forth a dripping reed and seemlessly moving back in to work once again. Slowly but surely what looks like a basket is forming beneath delicate, long-fingered hands that move with experience winding and twisting and weaving.

Powerful wings fling up sand some metres from the child upon the arrival of a bronze dragon, who's backwinging to land wth practised precision on the beach. Almost as soon as he's touched down, his over-eager rider vaults from his neck to his leg, sliding down an extended limb to thump into the sand boots first. The young man starts to pull off his riding gear, jacket and shirt first, but is interrupted by a polite snort from his bronze and a meaningful look in the young weaver's direction. ""Sorry about that! Hope we didn't disturb you!"" R'layn calls over, stepping forward and tripping on an errant shoelace on his half undone boot. ""Oops!"" He stumbles, then gives in to gravity's pull and turns as he falls to land on his back.

Niklo looks up sharply at the sudden movement nearby, and yet somehow the basket continues to take shape beneath those fingers, which move as rapidly as before without falter. That doesn't mean the young weaver doesn't react to the dragon suddenly plopping down out of nowhere, however! Green eyes widen slightly in surprise, but that's quickly replaced by a reserved curiousity, delicate facial features drawing into a frown. The child sighs, puts the basket to one side, on a stained cloth laid atop the sand, and stands a bit stiffly, careful not to scatter sand everywhere. Their head tilts to one side, thick braid falling to the left. ""No--"" the voice cracks and they try again, clearing their throat, ""No problem."" The child's voice is low and bland, almost surprisingly so for one appearing so young.

Talurith shakes his wings out and his eyes glitter unusually for a moment, a snort emerging sharply from his nostrils. You can almost hear him saying 'R'layn!'. Then the bronze is wading into the sea, laying his wings flat on the water's surface as he begins to swim lazily in the warm waters. His rider, meanwhile, is picking himself up and brushing sand off his trousers. Once sufficiently dusted off, he looks up at Niklo with a smile, though his eyes flick over the child curiously. ""Ah, okay. I hope Tal didn't get sand on your stuff. it looks very nice."" He peers at the object Niklo's been working on. ""A basket?"" He asks hopefully (did he get it right?)

The faintest hint of a smile crosses the child's face, but it quickly vanishes again. ""A basket,"" R'layn's guess is confirmed, ""Brother made me leave mine at home, so I needed a new one for here."" As soon as this is out, the youngster bites their lower lip as though having said too much. A quick headshake, which sends the braid swaying. ""Nevermind."" Visibly gulping, Niklo avoids looking at the bronzerider's direction and instead glances off towards the water at his dragon. ""What's his name?""

R'layn assumes a lop-sided grin as he spots that hint of a smile. ""Weaving's fun...makes me fingers hurt though."" His grin is replaced then by a half-frown, of concern rather than anger. ""Your uh...at home? Uh? Um."" He continues to look worried, but goes with the change of subject rather than pressing for details on what looks to be a sensitive issue. ""He's Talurith."" And there's pride in his voice - the pride of a rider for his dragon. The man's gaze turns to look at the bronze, too, where the dragon swims around smoothly. A glimmer of green eyes is seen as he looks back at the shore, sensing the attention on him. ""He loves the sea; can never wait to get in it."" A shuffle-shuffle of feet, and then Ril asks, ""What's your name?""

Niklo's nose crinkles at the mention of weaving making for hurting fingers. ""Yeh,"" comes a quick agreement, ""But I've been doin' it since I was five, so it's not so bad now."" A pause and again that poor lip is chewed on, this time more vigorously than before. Ow, that's gotta hurt! ""Home... I just came here. Brother brought me. Said I was too much trouble."" The child snorts softly, mumbling, ""I ain't trouble, he's just lazy..."" This is cut off by another quick shake of the head. ""Talurith,"" the dragon's name is repeated louder instead, and the youngster can't help but smile this time. ""Good name for a bronze. Strong name."" The smile becomes a full-blown grin. ""Oh, I'm Niklo. You?""

R'layn nods, tanned skin at the corners of his eyes wrinkling. After a moment's decision, he flops down with his legs sprawled out in front of him, looking up at Niklo. ""Five? That's pretty young. You, uh,"" he eyes the basket. ""Are pretty good at it though. It shows."" He offers a reassuring smile, not missing the child's discomfort. ""How long have you been here?"" He asks gently. With a smile, R'layn squints slightly, then looks at Niklo again. ""Talurith says thank you. And he's sorry he didn't warn you that he was going to land, as well."" The bronze can be seen flapping sparkling water up from the ocean. ""I'm R'layn."" The rider sticks his hand out automatically, then pauses, starts to withdraw it, but keeps it out, should Niklo wish to shake hands.

Broad shoulders shrug, their owner's expression becoming unbecomingly tired for one of such an age. ""I had to learn a lot real young. Brother's lazy,"" the comment is repeated again, no accusation in the low voice, just stating a fact. R'layn's question makes the child pause thoughtfully, considering. ""About... half a turn, I think?"" A slight smirk. ""'Mh'lar has far more important things to worry about now, and doesn't have time for a troublesome girl like you!'"" Niklo's voice raises to a squeak as she obviously imitates someone. Another shrug. ""I live with my uncle now, here. But it could be worse."" Glancing back towards the dragon, then looking directly at R'layn again, she smiles. ""Nice meetin' ya. And like I said, no problem!"" Cheerful now, for some reason, the strange girl reaches out to grab the rider's hand and shake it firmly, without hesitation.

The concerned expression makes a return for the almost aged appearence of the girl, as well as what she has to say. ""That's brothers for you,"" he tries that out, wrinkles returning. ""Half a Turn? That must feel like a long time?"" The impression gets just a small smile, in case the rider comes off as rude. ""Who's your uncle? If you don't mind my asking,"" Ril hastily amends. Talurith is making a show of swimming now, dipping under the surface to emerge and spout water everywhere, along with much flapping of sodden wings. R'layn seems cheered by Niklo's firm handshake, squeezing back a bit as if to test her strength. ""Nice to meet you too! I can't say I've seen you around, so it's nice to see you. And your work."" He smiles, nodding towards the basket.

Niklo doesn't seem offended in the least by the conversation - in fact, she almost appears relieved? ""It doesn't matter,"" she replies with a sigh, ""I didn't really feel like home was anywhere. What's the difference here?"" Turning away briefly, the youngster picks up the basket she'd been working on and dunks it into the larger one full of water. ""He's my great-uncle, really, but his name's Dharmed. He's a healer, though probably not for much longer. And, 'course you haven't seen me around,"" the girl grins wildly, ""I don't like meeting new people.""

R'layn watches the process of basket-dunking with interest, his hands playing idly with the black sand. ""A healer, eh? Good...good craft."" He blinks at the latter comment as to Dharmed's position. ""He's...going to a different Weyr?"" He asks, brows meeting in an earnest expression. He's not going to be for much longer for a good reason? ""You, uh, don't come out and meet us, huh? We don't bite,"" he flusters along. ""Well, not much."" A somewhat un-mannish giggle escapes his mouth. Talurith wades out of the water and flops down beside his rider leisurely, stretching his head out towards Niklo before laying it on the sand, sighing tiredly. ""Good swim, huh buddy?""

An almost evil expression crosses the girl's face and she shakes her head at R'layn's question. ""Nope. He's gonna keel over any day now. Betcha ten marks it'll be in another turn or less!"" Niklo starts to laugh, catches herself, and clears her throat. Figuring the basket is soft enough again, she takes it out and begins weaving again. ""I'm not so worried about biting,"" she replies, giving the bronzerider a sideways glance at the last bit of his comment, ""But if you meet people you get attatched to them, and then you don't wanna leave. You'll have to someday, though. Nothing lasts forever. Right?"" She looks up at the dragon as he flops down, not stopping her weaving but watching him nonetheless.

R'layn blinks. ""What're you gonna do if- when he does? Do you have any other relatives here?"" The rider barely even notices the fact that Talurith seems to be ready to fall asleep, the bronze's eyes slowly lidding over, another sigh making his chest heave. The water on the dragon is evaporating off in the heat already, though he's still shiny with wet in some places. ""Ah...you're thinking of moving on?"" R'layn stabs at a guess, looking at Niklo sympathetically. Talurith's nostrils twitch as he naps.

Niklo shrugs her strangely boyish shoulders. ""I don't wanna move on, but I guess that's what I'll do. Dunno where I'll go, though. Brother don't want me, and everybody else'll be dead that I know of. I guess I can try to settle in at a hold or something, maybe try becoming a weaver."" She wrinkles her nose at the through. ""I'll figure somethin' out! Maybe I'll get lucky and I'll lose my bet long enough that I can do what I really wanna do."" The girl grins at R'layn, then looks towards Talurith, her expression softening to a smile.

""Hrmm."" A tricky situation. R'layn's making little mounds of sand on either side of him with his hands, pushing the stuff around. ""Well, you've got the talent and experience to be a weaver. A Hold'd snap you up, I expect. And you're...young? Able to do whatever you want."" He looks at the girl studiously, trying to ascertain her age. ""Yeah, you probably will...bet?"" Blink-blink. He notes Niklo looking at Talurith then, and grins. ""You can touch him, if you want. He doesn't mind...he's half-asleep anyway. Loves the heat.""

The 'young' half-question seems to bring the girl back to herself, and she draws up as if to make herself seem taller. ""I'm almost eleven turns,"" she replies, as if that's very impressive indeed. Not ten, but *almost* eleven. Niklo manages this all of five seconds, then catches the offer and promptly forgets acting mature. Her basket is in the water once more and she's on her knees, peering at the dozing bronze eagerly. ""I..."" carefully, cautiously, she crawls over to the dragon and looks him up and down, ""I really want to be a dragonhealer someday..."" she whispers, reaching a hand out tentitively to touch the creature's shoulder. ""My dad was one.""

R'layn beams broadly. ""Almost eleven? You're a charming young lady, then,"" he adds. The brief display of maturity earns a lingering smile, and he watches Niklo crawl towards Talurith to touch him. The dragon doesn't move a muscle. Instead he takes a deep breath, letting it out in a long, warm, contented sigh. ""I think we have a young lady who's a dragonhealer...or training to be...around here. Alexiel, I think her name is? You could ask to work with her, if you wanted to see what it's like? sounds like your dad was a good man."" Ril's getting up now, brushing sand off the back of his trousers. ""It was nice to meet you, Niklo. I'll leave you with that happy lump-"" a nod to Talurith - ""for now. I need to go review some things with my Wingleader. Hopefully I'll see you around!"" With a cheery wave, the rider jogs off, in half-open boots, towards the plateau.

"event","This is Niklo's history, as written for my residency application at Ista Weyr:

Losanda, Niklo's mother, was a goldrider at Fort Weyr. Her first child, Mhalar, was the result of a mating flight, though her real love was a man named Nikolo, a dragonhealer. For a long time she had nothing to do with him, far too dedicated to the weyr, her dragon, and her son. But after many years her son was Searched and became a rider himself, and she found her resistance weakening. She gave in to her love of Nikolo, but the result of this was a second pregnancy - one her body couldn't handle. Twins at any age presented problems, but she was past her prime and it took its toll. During the birth she had a son and a daughter, but only one survived. The living child she named Niklo, after its father, and passed away before she could learn that it was her daughter that lived.

Stricken with grief and wanting nothing to do with a daughter to remind him of what he had lost, Nikolo poisoned himself to be with Losanda and their son. Niklo's half-brother and his father saw the girl as a bother, but cared for her until she was ten turns of age. Then, finally tired of her, Mhalar, by then Mh'lar, took her to Ista Weyr and put her in the care of their mother's uncle.

Niklo is an eager, intelligent girl, who's used to working hard and getting little to no thanks for it. That's her life and she's fine with it. She tends to be a bit unsure of herselt at times, due to the way she's been treated in the past, and she's wary about becoming too attatched to people after being uprooted from her home at Fort. All the same, she adjusts quickly and makes the best of the situation, settling right in and getting what needs to be done... well, done. When it comes to parents she's not really upset by the lack of hers - she never knew them, so why should she miss them? All in all, she's a good little girl, domestic as they come, molded to be that way by everything around her. Inside there's something wild, something spirited, but until she comes into herself that bit is locked away.

At the moment Niklo is ten turns, though in another month or two she will be eleven, as she's so fond of telling people.


ETA: While this is the original history, it has needed to be corrected due to conflicts with High Reaches being a PC weyr. For this reason Niklo's background takes place, instead, at Southern Weyr. All else is the same."

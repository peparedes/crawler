"event","Howard Stern was picking on Gabourey Sidibe on his show yesterday, talking about how overweight she is.  ""There's the most enormous, fat black chick I've ever seen. She is enormous. Everyone's pretending she's a part of show business and she's never going to be in another movie,"" he said. ""She should have gotten the Best Actress award because she's never going to have another shot. What movie is she gonna be in?""  He and co-host Robin Quivers went on to discuss the impossibility of Gabby finding any work in Hollywood after 'Precious.' 

""And Oprah's lying and saying you're going to have a brilliant career,"" said Robin. 

""Oprah's another liar, a filthy liar,"" said Stern. ""She's telling an enormous woman the size of a planet that she's going to have a career.""

If you don't know who she is, Gabourey Sidibe was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress in the film Precious.  

Okay, yes, she needs to lose weight; the pounds she's packing now are obviously unhealthy.  But, everybody deserves some respect, no matter how heavy he/she is.  

Poor Gabourey stuck out like a sore thumb amongst all the anorexic actresses out there - easy pickings for someone like Howard Stern.  It's unhealthy to be a size zero too, but for some reason, it's funnier and more popular to pick on people who are overweight."

Sorry, but if she'd said she supports gay marriage, every single right wing Christian in America would be screaming that she shouldn't be Miss USA because she doesn't support &quot;family values,&quot; or whatever else they could come up with.

It was a bad question for a pageant.&nbsp; She might as well have been asked&nbsp;about her religious beliefs and whether she believes a muslim should be president or some other sensational nonsense...it was a question clearly designed to create the divisiveness that Perez Hilton is complaining about...

I'm tired of the way everybody in Texas seems to have a country twang voice. 
I'm tired of how the IT guy asks me &quot;Whatcha eatin'?&quot; every time I happen to be chewing something. 
I'm tired of hearing my alarm clock&nbsp;go off 5 days a week. 
I'm tired of people looking me straight in the eye while they lie to me and I know it. 
I'm tired of hearing the phrase &quot;Good Morning.&quot; 
I'm tired of listening to people small talk about the weather and what they did this weekend. 
I'm tired of spending almost my entire life doing things I don't want to do. 
I'm tired of being a slave to bills and rent. 
I'm tired of never getting enough sleep and waking up 10 times a night. 
I'm tired of being stressed and depressed and having to take pills for it. 
I'm tired of people telling me I should go to church. 
I'm tired of hypocrites who go to church and claim to believe but have nothing to show for it. 
I'm tired of hearing the phone ring.
I'm tired of people who are full of shit.
I'm tired of people who abuse animals.
I'm tired of having nothing to look forward to.

I get this same thing every Monday morning....&quot;How was your weekend?&quot;&nbsp; 

Ferfuksake people, do you truly care what I did over the weekend or at Christmas?&nbsp; What's wrong with not saying anything to each other about shit that we really don't care about?&nbsp; It is so hard to just be around each other in silence...do we HAVE to constantly have sound waves traveling through the air to break the uneasy feeling of standing next to or walking with another person in silence?

So, for those of you who have played the game....I've contracted porphyric hemophilia (vampirism) and I'm on a quest for the cure.  In this game, it's NOT cool (IMO) to be a vampire, because you'll have to spend the rest of the game finding people to feed on or else you won't be able to go out during the day.  Oh and a pack of wolves killed my horse yesterday.  Yikes.  For my race profile I chose a female Dark Elf, and I'm born under the sign of the Thief.

And when I say swarming...I mean SWARMING.  This morning, I was walking the dogs, and I looked down....I was COVERED in mosquitoes....I must have looked like a damn fool screaming and slapping myself all over and running towards the house with the dogs in tow.  I bought some Deep Woods Off and used it for their afternoon walk, and it seemed to work pretty good.  The dogs have their Revolution on, so they should be protected as well.  Anyway, at night, I don't want to get sprayed down with Off...it's kinda stinky and sticky and I'm about to get into bed....so I put on long pants,boots, a shirt and a sweat shirt.  I'm making darn skippy those little suckers don't have a chance in hell to bite me.

This past Friday, a secretary who works with me admitted that she took a letter from my filing to make a copy of the letter...and then lost the letter before she could put it back where she found it.  We need this letter as an exhibit to file a Motion to Compel with the court this week.  All this crap went down late Friday afternoon, and I told her I would go ahead and call the person who sent us the document on Monday morning, to see if she would resend it.  

So...guess who calls in sick today?  Yep, the secretary who lost my letter.  Lucky for her, I got in touch with the letter's originator, and she faxed me the letter again this morning.  Long story short, Miss ""I'm gonna call in sick and let Candace catch hell"" is lucky I was able to get another copy of that letter, because I would have gladly thrown her under the bus for calling in sick today, so that I could handle her fuckup.

"event","A few days ago, a murder was committed in my back yard.  A murder of monstrous proportions...a heinous crime....not against nature, though.  Heh.

Looking out the back door, I could see Pablo busy getting after something under a bush.  His entire body was wagging and shaking, so I knew it must be something alive.  I opened the back door and went to investigate...as I got closer, Pablo decided to grab his prey and run...it immediately started screaming wildly....I couldn't figure out what the hell it was because Pablo moved so quickly, thrashing his head all about, and he wouldn't drop it.

It only took Joel a minute to come outside to see WTF all the commotion and ""NO PABLO, STOP NO NO NO NO!!!!"" was all about.  As soon as Pablo saw Joel coming, he dropped the...*gasp* baby bird, and hunkered his guilty little body down, as Joel picked him up to be deposited inside the house.  In the meantime, the baby bird was screaming in agony and pain.  Its body was crushed and bleeding from Pablo's sharp canines and all the shaking and thrashing that Pablo had inflicted on it.  Joel grabbed a big stick and immediately put it out of its misery.

So there you have it.  A murder in my back yard.  And Pablo is as pleased as punch about it.

Just fyi (in case you don't already know this), Pablo is a rat terrier...and terriers are bred to kill. Period.  It was quite amazing to see Pablo's instinctive prey drive in action.  While I don't condone killing baby birds, Pablo was doing what comes naturally to him.  That baby bird was doomed either way, having fallen from its nest at such an early age."

"event","so, christmas vacation for us pma girls is officially started, thank god. one more day of weird girls and polyester skirts and i might have gone insane. i got an e-mail from my guidance counsuler saying that i got an almost perfect score on my PSAT's. i kinda laughed since that.. is practically a miracle. apparently i outscored everyone in my school. weiiirdddd. im glad schools over, since im fighting for practically everything that i have, its a relief to get a break from it. i just pray i dont have to leave this school, i honestly love it. i understand taking away practically everything, because in their eyes, i suppose i am guilty, but im honestly not. i guess i can live, but i just want to be able to play lacrosse and be in nhs. everything else i can deal with. beleive me, i will fight for those two. i know jim's dad will fight for the lacrosse part, because he knows how much its a part of my life, so hopefully he has some influence on the administration. school is just so.. complicated. mraw.

as for newspaper, here we go. so stephen and i met for dinner tonight. i know that i went in with a bad attitude about it, and i know i probabably shouldnt have been so icky, but i was pissed and was ready to made my point known. i know im a very emotional person, and if im mad at you, your going to feel my wrath. after 20 minutes of complete silence, he appologized for his jerkish comments, and everythings pretty much normal. it just annoys me because i know that his whole heart isnt into this, and it should be and its not going to be the best that it can be if im the only one giving any effort. i still havent seen any of his feedback,and its frustrating. but... with vacation here ill basically force him to do it, otherwise were out of it, and im not quitting. i know its not just his fault, so we both need to work harder on it, i need to ease up on him, and he needs to give me reasons to ease up on him. boys will be boys i suppose. 

so jackie called me and informed me that she leaves tomorrow for georgia until january 3rd. sooo umm.. theres my vacation. our friendship has been so icky latley. its seriously because we aare wayyy to much alike. and i know thats why we are best friends, but it also gets us in trouble when it comes to issues. i love her to death, its just frustrating because i know her so well, and i dont know whats going on. we had made plans for some one on one girl time, since we hardly ever get that, but well catch up when she gets back. as for now.. im left with todd haha. i watched the mighty ducks tonight, it was enlightening, fo sho. todd makes me laugh because everything is either 100% jackie, or 100% hockey. i love him because he does amazing things for my best friend and i know he loves her, its so cute, honestly.

as for vacation, i have no idea what is going on. i know tomorrow for the first day of my glorious vacation i have to help move 100 bales of hay for my freaking horses. butttt.. the advantage of having a best friend with an amazingly strong boyfriend, is that i get help moving those 100 bales of hay in exchange for homemade cookies. help means, that i get to tell him where to move it, while, todd moves it. it was pretty hectic making the cookies though, i burnt 4 sets of them, then my mom told me that i was making the house black, so she did it. i honestly love my mom, shes amazing. she even made me some sugar free cookies, i think she feels bad since she denied her diabetes stricken daughter soda, and tried taking it out of my hands and spilt it on my white shirt that is now ruined. yeah, i almost made her walk home for that one. poorrr stacey. so when i moved into this room, i had a box on my bed in my old room, that was supposed to come here, considering it had 2 christmas presesnts that are virtually irreplaceable, and i left that box on my bed, so paul would realize that it was important and wasnt to be thrown away. but, when i went to wrap the box today, it was no where to be found, when i asked paul about it, he informed me that he thought i wanted it thrown away. noooo.  you do not understand. that box had ""do not throw away"" on it in big black letters on it. and i wouldnt be nearly as mad if i could actually go out and buy these presents, but i cant, since its not able to be purchased, i only got it because ive been working on it since last july, and of people who my mom know. and i wouldnt be nearly as mad if it wasnt for the most important person in my life. sooooo.... im out of those presesnts. my mom said that she can try and get replacements, but its not like shes going to get them before christmas. imm sooooo screwed. but as for replacement presesnts, i have no idea what to get the person,  because i dont know what he would want/like. gooddd im screwed. buttt.. pauls even more screwed since im extremly pised at him. he can walk to and from work and school. i know he threw that box away on purpose. sooo something he would do. mraw. 

im so sick of people and opening their mouths. honestly. watch what you say, because 9 times out of 10, it will come back to bite you. ooorrrr.. something you say not meaning it, will hurt peopple. my sisters a freaking weirdo. ""apparently i got all the beauty in this family""... yeah.. apparently i got all the brains. ""incompitent teenager""....""you dont deserve it because your not thankful, and your ugly""... sue me bittchhhh, literally. yeah nice sister, i know... my favorite was ""you think your so cool just because your legitimate.""..... god, i did get all the brains."

"event","well yesterday i figured out that when you dont talk to people for 6 years, they basically change. its just weird because i know stephen as  this little kid with the funny voice and over-achieving qualities that made you want to put gum in his hair in kidnergarten.and now, hes just... different. sometimes it doesnt even seem like he cares about this article and what its for, im the one that always has to start everything. but, i guess people always change. I guess I've changed too. for instance, i dont have overly large ears anymore, and i dont watch gilligan's island after school anymore,haha. but as for todays entry, im not very pleased with stephen, and his ass hole qualities today. i soooo wanted to put gum in his hair, or throw a brick at his face, either or. i think this was the whole point of doing this article, you find out that you cant stand people. I think I've just figured it out early. As for now, me and stephen arnt talking, and we still have 5 weeks together. tomorrow should be pleasant. god i hate boysssss.

as for the rest of my life minus stephen and his sarcastic remarks, i started christmas shopping today, only to realize that i dont know what to get anyone. i've done all my moms shopping for her, now i just need to get a move on mine. gooodddd.. christmas is so commericialized now, it makes me want to.... banish christams. bah humbug."

"event","my newspaper thing sucks. i havent even started it. soooo wich means i need to spend 16 hours with stephen in the next 5 days. yeahh sweet. at least its with someone i actually like. if i had gotten stuck with anyone else it wouldnt have been so good. buttt.. i can actually stand him so its all good. it would have been easier if i had picked jackie.. we spend 16 hours together in a day.. haha <BR>
<BR>
i think that i have too many horses. i end up bringing them home from work for  a week or two then i cant get rid of them.. i need to stop. i think ill just end up keeping my orginal 3.. only its really 2 since i cant have killean back for 4 months.. poor baby. i swear that horse is my soul mate, i love him so much. yeah, if you met him you would too. i rode guy today and it was fun, i got bucked into a gigantic pile of snow.. sweet life, i think im still kinda frozen. buttt.. whatchagoynnadoo. i hung out with jackie and todd today. todd's like.. back for the week days then he'll go back for the weekends which ends up being pretty good since im there every saturday at least. this whole driving to plymouth for paul thing is sooo ridiculous. its not that long of a drive, but its like.. almost 4 times a week. i dont mind on weekends, but during the week its hard. i ended up driving ben last saturday to my aunts for this sleepover thing..and i stayed at a hotel so i wouldnt have to deal with all the.. kids. bens ok.. but hes only one kid, not 6. interesting night.. tons of fun. haha <BR>
so this OAR concert is one month from tonight. im pretty excited. me and jackie are supposed to go. we have a third ticket,and unless things dont work out todd or sean will probably go and well end up spending the night there. itll be pretty cool getting away from massachusetts for a night i guess. its just weird being that far away from home. i cannttt wait though. or jody really wants to go so maybe just me and him will go? who knowwssss. fridays aprils birthday and the partyy thingy. i probably wont go since im all like.. not partyish anymore. its just easier and not worth it. as for the rest of the weekenndd... who knows. me and jackie will probably end up sleeping at todds for the weekend. should be funn stuff. katherine needs to hang out with me but shes always working... grrrrrrr....."

"event","well.. i have this gigantic newspaper thing comming up in a few weeks.. and i need to publish my thoughts publically.. so why not on livejournal.. sweet dude i know. well... as for my life, me and katherine went to the OAR concert Thursday night. I wasnt orginally supposed to go with katherine.. but whatever crap happens.. we had an amazing time. except for like.. everything went wrong. I got home late because my mom decided that she needed to come home from the hospital 2 hours before i was supposed to leave, so i ended  up picking katherine up a good 2 hours later than originally planned. well.. once on the road to umass, which was the longest ride possibly ever. the exits were like.. an hour apart and it was wicked sketchy. once we got off the exit we saw a sign that said cocktails. i thought it was amusing at least.  asking for directions to the hotel was sketchy considering the kid we asked was a little eccentric.. rushhellllll. oh boy. after arriving at the hotel.. me and katherine decided to go to applebeas for dinner and i ended up spilling water on my pants in the bathroom.. looking like a pee stain, but i think i was pretty discret about it lol. we got to the concert and got searched? ha. we found our seats then decided to walk around, to see the sights? the only thing i saw was half naked girls and drunk/high people everywhere, pretty gross. so the opening band was pretty amazing. the kids we sat kinda near were pretty funny, poster boys for prozac. i ended up having a horrible night,and once OAR got on stage.. i was pretty much done with the whole concert thing. but having the amazing katherine with me, she made me laugh and i got through it.i was just.. not happy. we ended up getting second-hand high because of all the pot smoking that was going on, and for the rest of the night i couldnt stop laughing. after the concert, we went back to the hotel and hung out with a friend of katherines. after he left, we went to bed and talked about how our relationships sucked.. and then fell asleep as i remember. <BR>
<BR>
when we woke up, situations hadnt gotten any better so i was still in a crappish mood, and we left and started going home. OMG. we ended up getting extremly lost.. like no kidding we ended up on this wicked sketchy road called coonleyville road.. only there were at least 8 coonleyville roads. basically.. if you ever want to make a texas chainsaw massacre movie in massachusetts.. go to coonleyville road. but then it wouldnt be texas anymore? w/e. i ended up hysterically crying we were so lost. once we got on the road we were supposed to be on, we were fine and then we got a flat tire. it was horrible. neither of us knowing how to change a tire didnt handle it well.. and it was just a mess. 2 state police ended up comming, and katherines dad, and this weird blue car...? the whole way home things were just soooo ridiculous.  i cried the whole way home lol. once i got home it was basically worse. i get in the house to my grandfather reading the box of a porn movie at the kitchen table. ""teen sluts from czechoslovakia"" to be exact. gooddddd i dont know lol. im just glad to be home. i think? haha"

They wait a while now don't they? Um... school holidays drives you insane sometimes... Need to do science homework. Can't be BUGGERED! Like i can ever be buggered...

Anyone have any suggestions on what i should write? Anything at all. ANYONE! Fine. Go to hell. It's not like i care... 

Well my brother had his birthday. The screams of little boys shall torment me for like. I want Lor to hurry up and get her ass on google talk but she won't! Cruel! CRUEL! Well.. ah... bugger. I'm home alone right now until eight so theres not alot to do when you're stuck out in the middle of NOWHERE! At three i need to go and get jester and do all the chores around here and clean up crap and coruption. That gives me about 40 minutes of bored time. 

Maybe i could do karioke with the broom? hehe... I was saving that for later when i'm bored again. I'll wait. Hm.... What's on the television tonight? Crap, crap, crap and more crap. Exciting stuff.  

Thats it! I'm gonna go be nosey at others journals. ADEOUS AMEGOS!"

She sat at her desk gazing over at the clock. Slowly it ticked towards the desired number where all was free for the weekend. Next to her was her friend hurriedly tacking notes so was not to forget anything for homework. Another girl in front of her was practising holding her nose higher than anyones. It glistened off of the light hanging above her as if she had spent all night polishing it just to get the right gleam. Next to her was a boy picking his nose in a horrid fasion. The girl screwed up her face in disgust and moved her books to the other end of the desk. Finally the teacher stood up and held a book in her hand as she read a couple of lines and tried to get the thick heads in the front row to understand. They merly went back to passing notes and day dreaming. The girl just shock her head and gazed back at the clock. She was deparate to go home. Too bad it was only first period."

1. From when i was about eight you controlled my life and made me follow you like a sheep. Thank god that only lasted a year! I was there for you and was everything a good friend should be but you always saw me as second best. I'm glad i don't have to see your ugly face ever again. 

2. Your blind as a bat, you can't distingwish a broom from a person yet i love you all the same. I just wish you were a little more... obervant.

3. To be honest i love you more than anyone in the world yet i'll never amit it.

4. I used to be scared of you. Shocking i know but at least your getting better.

5. Your as bad as number two. Try to read other people better before you open your trap and say things. I still love you though.

6. Your complaining drove me up the wall yet i still care. 

7. We use to be best friends but we drifted apart. My worst regret is letting you go.

8. For countless years we were best friends but we drifted apart. The thing i'll never tell you is that I'm worried because of the split with your folks.

9. I just plain hate you. best friend or not, i just hate you. To be honest i was happy when you went to a different school yet i still have to go to your place all the time. P.S. you can't play guitar or horse ride so don't try. Plus your rats suck.

I can't dye it black (stupid mother. it's just the teen rebellion talking but when i get out of her reach i swear i'll get a tattoo just to piss her off!) so i reasoned with her to let me dye it blond with black streaks. Hey it's better than brown! I also convinced her to paint my room. For so long i have been stuck with the PINK room that i have hated with every fiber of my being and now she's letting me paint it. The world is save! Haleluya! It's only cream but still NO PINK! God i can't wait until she loses control of my life. Then it is mine to mold! Mwahahahahahahaha! 

I never got to ride Jester today like i planned. Hey! Maybe if i paint the hallway i'll get some money to go on my way. Aren't i brainy! What? They were going to paint it anyway! I better go get dressed soon. God it's hot today. Black is not a good colour for summer. Remember. So i might as well start the list of jobs:

1. Paint hallway
2. wash truck and cars
3. Do any little chores around the house
4. Sell stuff on trade me
5. go through room to sell stuff on trade me
6. Clean water trough (okay maybe i'm not that desperate)

Okay so today was mufti. Every person i walk past thoguht they were oh so origanal and coughed 'goth' when they walked past. No shit you idiots. There was this huge thing at lunch were this group of goths got in a fight with some dipshits, i don't know what happened. This is why we have uniform. Cause assholes can't keep their pride and act together. There was a rumor on the bus i heard (kinda not hard to miss since it's thew only thing people are talking about) that one goth boy stabbed another boy with some cheap knife of sorts. I think its just a bunch of idiots thinking their all superior and spreading wild fire. Well the whole school was at this one place like a bunch of sheep trying to get their noses in other peoples bussness. I went cause friends made me. Wow, the thrill of my life! Nothing was happening except one goth boy was really worked up. And so if the rumors true then so what? I have a friend who bites people and leaves huge scars. Now that's vicious. 

So what else happened in my day? Instead of stupid stories, goth remarks, friends trying to pair them up with their crushes (don't make me gag) and cold weather, nothing really happened. Why do mufti days always show peoples real colours? Snobs rain down on unsespecting passers by, punks being as loud as they possibaly can, goths hanging in their own groups, loners being loners, boys being idiots, girls being air heads and normal people getting swept up in all the comotion.

please rosie, speak to me?
i thought what we had was special
SOB
:(
:(
;(
okay, im going. dont 4get 2 ask ur mum about party. u can be dropped off here if u want

The funny thing was that my mum was on the net at the time so lor was practcially talking to herself! HAHA!

So what happened today. Firstly last nights play list consisted of Simple Plan over and over and over again! Geez i wish simple plan could blend like buddy. Can't get blend buddy on so your stuck with homework. Today was boring. Was late for Art cause stupid librarian held me up. You could litterally see steam come out of the srt teachers ears! God she was pissed with me. Oh well. Can't please everyone! 

Lor also got me this badge that says 'sell me drugs.' Very nice. Air is a drug people. We are addicted to it, are always taking it and can't live without it cause we're addicted. Come on people, the first step to succsess is amitting your problem.

My form teacher decided to read out over due library book as well. I was so happy that the whole class found out that i had five over due books, including such as william shakespere (the biggest bloody book i've ever seen). So at library duty today i returned them all and got out five more. 

Also i wrote this little story while i the computer room about how the stupid computer wouldn't work (including swear words) and accidentaly handed it in. Oh crap! I hope the teacher see's the humor in it. If not then i'm in shit. 

Nothing else to say. Need to find Lor and tell her i was not ignoring her. Later."

"event","Just for the fact Lor I do NOT have my period. (Pokes tongue). Anyway last night i watched half of my big fat greek wedding. Then mum told me to go to bed. I couldn't sleep so i put on my earphones and listened to music and read a book. I read one chapter until the book got boring and just listened to music. I got through the whole cd of the rasmus, twice the whole way through of Simple Plan (the cheerist music i could find), parts of nickleback (cause some of the songs are calm) and some radio (ads eventually drove me up the wall). By that time i was bored again and glanced at the clock. Big mistake. One in the morning! ONE! So that was it! I forced myself to sleep after a while. Today still groggy and keep getting head aches. DAMN YOU.... WHATEVER THE HELL YOU ARE! I-need-sleep!

Still haven't done homework. Oh well. Hopefully i won't have to since i missed the days you where suppose to hand it in. Maybe i could do more if i don't sleep tonight. Really i don't care. Okay down to horse show. It was fun. A total of three people fell off their horses, heaps got disqualified for three refusals, one got disquilified cause she went before the bell and two ran straight through jumps. Very entertaining. Lindersfarm won though. Only one of our teams got anywhere and that was 6th. The bottom of the barrel. A friend turned out to be there as well. 

What to say now? Nothing really. I feel like frying buddy today. Tomorrow hopefully i'll get to blend him. Fun. Still no lepricorn. Don't ask me where he went."

"event","Well what happened since the last time i wrote in here 7 hours ago? It turns out that the fish net hoop was throwen away so instead i just put a bucket on top of the ladder and threw it into there. The bucket kept falling down though and making this huge noise but who cares? Didn't do homework either. Oh well. Have day off tomorrow so can do it there i guess. Teenage rebelion must be showing.

Got one review for the songs i put up which was another one called My Home Life of Imagination. Not the other one i put up. Also Lor got me something. God knows what. She says it's small and black. Another candle? Beats me! Any suggestions? Nope since this things deserted. I don't care though. If i did i would have stopped writing ages ago. Journals are meant for things you would write that you normally wouldn't say publicy, not some thing where other people are suppose to go on about how tradgic their lives are for attention. 

What else to say? Oh tomorrow's weather is suppose to be like a small tornado which will be lovily for being outside. People competing in the show better get ready to fall off their horses cause they are all bound to be nuts cause of the weather. At least i don't have to deal with jumps. I get to write down scores. Yay!

Something must be bothering me if i'm not getting sleep. Maybe it's cause Lor's moving away? No don't think so. Hormones? No. School? No. Boys? Hell no. So wha could it be? Hm. Maybe it's just that time of month. I don't know! Whatever. My brain hurts!"

I think i'll got outside and play basket ball with the cheap fishnet hoop. Still can't think of what i was suppose to do. Horse show tomorrow. Put two of the songs i wrote on fictionpress. Put the 'project' on hold as i have lost interest for the time being. 

That's about it i think. need to get off soon so little bro can go on for reasons i don't know. I have been really tired and out of it lately but don't know why. Hm....

Got pulled up for nail polish AGAIN! Test run didn't work. Got report. Alright i guess. Today i had guitar which was alright. Stupid thing is trying to  kill me. 

Right now i'm just blah. i blame hormones. Damn mood swings. you would think choclate would help but NO! You just feel more blah. Oh well. Liveliness is not in my vocabulary today. Neither is happy. I feel like sleeping too. Got little sleep last night. Talking to Lor but not really paying any attention. Just writing hm everytime she talks. 

Tonight i feel like relaxing with candles. That sounds good. Better kill the smoke alarm some time."

"event","I'm planning about tonight. Tonight is the offical test run of my 'project.' It's perfect because Mum's away at Wellington and Dad's off at a fishing meeting until ten so as long as i palm my bro off to bed and supposedly go to 'bed' myself then no one should interrupt me until ten! Dad'll just come in to check up and thhen go to bed. When that man's asleep nothing short of an earthquake can wake him! 

Last night i spent so long researching. I bet you tonight i will have no sleep with the amount of stuff i have to sort out. I should get off and do homework. I'll do it during everyone hates chris. Stole a box of matches from one of the draws in the kitchen so i can finally light my candles! Happy! Will have to start closing the door though. Setting off the smoke alarm is NOT a good idea. 

Lor brung her tarot cards today and was reading peoples futures with them in the library. P.E. teacher pulled me up for black nail polish! DAMN YOU BASTARD!!! I'll put it back on soon and just put my hands in fists when he's around. Lor's getting pissed cause i won't tell her about my project. Oh well. I'm surprised she hasn't figured it out! I guess it's so different that it's hard. SWEET! Now if you don't mind my cat won't shut up and i need to gag him. See you next time. The lepricorn sitting on my bed says hello.

I did find a source that could help me and emailed them but the email didn't go through! Luckily i got mum to delete it before she read it. If she did then i would have been in deep shit! Luckily she didn't. THANK GOD!

So there's another clue for you Lorren. Another is look at the supposed amount of entries i've writen today and the amount your aloud to see. Yes! Ones private! See if you can figure it out. See ya!

Here I am - this is me
I come into this world so wild and free
Here I am - so young and strong
Right here in the place where I belong 
It's a new world - it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of a young heart
It's a new day - in a new land
And it's waiting for me - here I am
 

This Is Where I Belong


I hear the wind across the plain
A sound so strong - that calls my name
It's wild like the river - it 's warm like the sun
Ya it's here - this is where I belong
Under the starry skies - where eagles have flown
This place is paradise - it 's the place I call home
The moon on the mountains
The whisper through the trees
The waves on the water
Let nothing come between this and me
Cuz everything I want - is everything that's here
And when we're all together - there's nothing to fear
And wherever I wander - the one thing I've learned
It's to here - I will always...always return


I Will Always Return (Part One)


I hear the wind call my name
The sound that leads me home again
It sparks up the fire - a flame that still burns
To you I will always return
I know the road is long but where you are is home
Wherever you stay - I'll find the way
I'll run like the river - I'll follow the sun
I fly like an eagle - to where I belong
I can't stand the distance - I can't dream alone
I can't wait to see you -Yes, I'm on my way home
And now I know it's true
My every road leads to you
And in the hour of darkness
Your light gets me through
You run like the river - you shine like the sun
You fly like an eagle
You are the one I've seen every sunset
And with all that I've learned
Oh it's to you - I will always return



I Will Always Return (Part Two)


I hear the wind call your name
It calls me back home again
It sparks up the fire - a flame that still burns
Oh it's to you I'll always return
I still feel your breath on my skin
I hear your voice deep within
The sound of my lover - a feeling so strong
It's to you - I'll always belong
Now I know it's true
My every road leads to you
And in the hour of darkness darlin'
Your light gets me through
Wanna swim in your river - be warmed by your sun
Bathe in your waters - cuz you are the one
I can't stand the distance - I can't dream alone
I can't wait to see you -Ya I 'm on my way home
Oh I hear the wind call your name
The sound that leads me home again
It sparks up the fire - a flame that still burns
Oh, it's to you - will always return



Here I Am (Part Two)


Here I am - this is me
There's no where else on earth I'd rather be
Here I am - it's just me and you
And tonight we make our dreams come true
It's a new world - it's a new start
It's alive with the beating of - young hearts
It's a new day - it 's a new plan
I've been waiting for you
Here I am
Here we are - we've just begun
And after all this time - our time has come
Ya here we are - still goin'strong
Right here in the place where we belong
Chorus
Here I am - next to you
And suddenly the world is all brand new
Here I am - where I'm gonna stay
Now there's nothin standin in our way
Here I am - this is me"

"event","I thought I saw a man brought to life 
He was warm 
He came around like he was dignified 
He showed me what it was to cry 
Well you couldn't be that man I adored 
You don't seem to know 
Seem to care what your heart is for 
But I don't know him anymore 
There's nothing where he used to lie 
My conversation has run dry 
That's what's going on 
Nothing's fine I'm torn 

I'm all out of faith 
This is how I feel 
I'm cold and I am shamed 
Lying naked on the floor 
Illusion never changed 
Into something real 
I'm wide awake 
And I can see 
The perfect sky is torn 
You're a little late 
I'm already torn 

So I guess the fortune teller's right 
Should have seen just what was there 
And not some holy light 
Which crawled beneath my veins 
And now I don't care 
I had no luck 
I don't miss it all that much 
There's just so many things 
That I can touch I'm torn 

I'm all out of faith 
This is how I feel 
I'm cold and I am shamed 
Lying naked on the floor 
Illusion never changed 
Into something real 
I'm wide awake 
And I can see 
The perfect sky is torn 
You're a little late 
I'm already torn 
Torn 

There's nothing where he used to lie 
My inspiration has run dry 
That's what's going on 
Nothing's right I'm torn 

I'm all out of faith 
This is how I feel 
I'm cold and I am shamed 
Lying naked on the floor 
Illusion never changed 
Into something real 
I'm wide awake 
And I can see 
The perfect sky is torn 

I'm all out of faith 
This is how I feel 
I'm cold and I'm ashamed 
Bound and broken on the floor 
You're a little late 
I'm already torn 
Torn.."

"event","So to report on what happened at horse of the year. It was fantastic! Bri was acting like a all high and mighty so naturaly i followed. I had no idea what i was talking about so half way i gave up. Bri didn't though. She was forgetting she's still a beginner and not a expert horse rider. Well yesterday she got knocked down a few noches. She fell off Jester (long story. Not his fault. He was nervious cause he got caught in the electric tape the night before so was nervoius. Anyway mum told her to not trot today. He stopped o0n her and she fell off. There's more to it but am too lazy to type it all!) and was complaining about a sore shoulder. She went to the hospital and got an xray to find it was just spraned. She's got it in a sling and a week off p.e. Anyway the horse of the year was great except for the drunk idiots who ruined the whole thing.

Yesterday i went with Lor shopping and brought a jacket (cheap $20 job), a chinese lantern, a bag, subway and other bits and bobs. I did get something for my 'project' but still need more things. Also got subway for lunch. The whole time lor and i were on highs! We watched Underworld and the pireted copy of the second underworld. We went to the heroworth fair today and tomorrow i have a dance practise with steph for a dance thing she forced me in to cause they were short of people. 

So now i'm sitting here trying to thing of something entertaining to do. I have maths to do but that shouldn't be hard. Tomorrow i also need to get going on the social studies project. I feel like being creative. here's a random piece of writing:

The air grew thick and she breathed in the little remaining oxegen she could save. The world grew small as a pang was felt in her chest. No more than a pang, a great cut leaving her standing there to bleed her heart to death. Her future grew blank as a single tear rolled down her cheek as she struggled to come to terms with the horrifieing truth. Her knees grew weak as jelly as she fell to the floor, her eyes never leaving the horrible twist of fate that was unfolding in front of her eyes. She could hear her own heavy breathing and the beat of her broken heart ringing deafening in her ears. Her eyes followed as her dead lover fell to the hard, cold ground. It seemed to take an enternity as his body made its desent to the horrible misfortune of death and the floor with his killers own two feet stayed planted, unmoving and uncaring. He held the knife in his hand tightly so his nuckles turned white as his anger still lay over boiling point. Soon he hit the ground and his lifeless body lay there for both to see. The young woman stared at his wound until the reality hit her. Tears spilled out of her eyes as great sobs leaped from her throat. She held her dead lover in some failed hope that if she did he would never truly leave her. His blood cover her hands and torso as she muttered and whispered messages. She did this so quietly like they were sharing a secret that would stay between them and never leave. A secret that made them both smile and laugh. But there was no laughter or smiles here as she let her tears and sobs make her dizzy and sick. Seeing all this the killer dropped his knife as all his anger disappered and guilt finally came to him. He quickly ran outside and violently vomited into the bushes. He wished he could change it all but the horrible dead had already been done and there was no going back.

Is that any good? Dad just came home from his fishing thing so better go. See you!"

So my day was normal once again. Very boring. Tomorrow is horse of the year. Yay! On Saturday i've organized a day with Lor in either Hastings or Napier. Hopefully Napier. While I'm there i should pick up some things that i need for my little 'project.' Mother still isn't home. Takes her a while to get here i guess but she's certainly taking her time.

Well i better get off. I have heaps of research to do. And i mean alot! Why did i have to chose a hard project. It could have been something as simple as painting my room! That's the next thing. I HATE PINK!"

Well not alot to say. I signed up to S.A.D.D. (Students Against Drink Driving) and am the youngest member! Go me! I also did stupid library duty. I only signed up cause we get first pick at the new books and i get to go up in the senior section. And it's working! 

Theres nothing else to say. Oh, Lor don't read or i'll make it a private journal! No wait you have to get one of these things and then i'll keep it open to you! Got it? I hope so. MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH (Breathes) HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm done. Anyway Rata asembily was the freakest thing in my life. This total stranger came and sat next to me. Okay that's normal and alright but the freaky part was he kept staring at me! I had all that i could take half way and shot him a 'piss off buddy!' look. He looked at the wall for the rest of the time! HAHA! Serves him right. I am in no interest for boys. There all stupid, fat, rude, horrible, cruel creatures that i wouldn't touch with a barge pole! So let me make this clear for the record: ALL BOYS ARE SELFISH PIGS AND ARE INCOSIDERITE, INTORIBALE THINGS OF PURE UGLINESS! I HATE THEM AND PLAN TO BECOME A SPINSER LADY WITH HEAPS OF CATS! If i didn't make it clear: I HATE BOYS! 

Didn't get a hint? You're lost. I must say though a few of them make great friends but the rest is like i said above.

Now to go off the subject and do homework."

Okay today wasn't exciting again. Yesterday Bri came. I tried my hardest to tell her, ""I have homework!"" But she came for the night and then invited herself to stay longer and to the horse of the year with us. Joy! Jeez some people can't take a hint...

Still have that English essay. Am getting off straight after this and am doing it! Can't wait until horse of the year. I wish bri wasn't coming. The fun of it is watching it without someone constantly talking in your ear. Maybe i can lose her in the crowds? Go hide in the pub! That place is always packed! Don't worry i'll order a orange juice. I love the jumping though. Thats cool! Maybe i can leave her in the pub...

Anyway it's annoying me. Dads away all week for some fishing crap. Mum's thinking of seeing if she can find some dumb shit and swaping the ugly deformed thing for something worth showing. And bro is... watching t.v. Exciting! GREEN DAY ROCKS!!!!!!!! Well maybe i'll update later when i have something to talk about. Well what happened today Rosie?

Well... 

If you knew the boerdom then you would die. Believe me. I've already died. Well i think i have. I think the lepricorn  sitting on the bed has saved me. ""Thanks Mr. Green Guy!""

""You're Welcome! Now burn things! BURN!""

Okay. Scary..."

"event","Well i finally got some drama in my life and its something i'm not happy about. It's not involving me but my friend Lor. She's moving soon to Chrischurch and that's sad and all but its not why i'm writing this. Here's the story in a play-by-play from what i heard. I'm doing it like this cause i feel creative:

Lor turned a corner searching for her father. She had a question for him that was very important and needed an answer. You see her friend Eli's birthday was that weekend but it was the time of month when her family had no money and was egerly waiting for the pay check next week. Knowing this she preceded to ask her father if there was any money in the bank.
""Of course there is!"" he told her slightly stressed with his new job buisness.
Happy she went and sat down to watch t.v. with her mother. While watching t.v. she discussed with her mother what she would get Eli for her birthday.
""How can we when we have no money?"" her mother asked her strangely.
Furious with her fathers discet she aproced him furious.
""Why did you lie to me?"" she asked.
Her father ignored her unhappily.
""Why did you lie to me?"" she asked again.
Still silence. She became mad with her father to almost boiling point.
""Why did you lie to me?"" she asked once more.
Stressed he snapped and threw his keys at her face. Luckily she dodged them by jumping behind the door.

That's all i know but am very scared for Lor. This guys a big man and lor already hates him. He makes her cry and god i hate him too. And not just because he can't cook. 

Anyway I'm probably paranoid. Anyway lets see what's going on in my life. I signed up for a horse show to help out of course. We had atheletics. My nana came who is the most boring person on the face of the planet. She's starting to show her age and treats me like a seven year old. Plus she's a neat freak. I know she mean's well but i can't stand her! 

My life is still boring. I keep thinking of running away and going on an adventure. Normal life is just too boring. How do people live?! I know it will always just be a fantasy but it's so exciting to think that one day I'm going to run away from here and live my own life free and as happy as can be. The thought has crossed me 'why not just imagine but do it!' What would i do? Where would i go? Where do i get the money? What of my education? What if i'm found? What about my friends? I just can't leave Lor even if she'll leave me soon. No i can't let this stupid fantasy be thought of as reality. But it's been my stupid fantasy for two years soon to be three. No i won't think of it as serious. Still dreaming isn't bad is it?

Whatever. Lor needs one of these journal things. This journal is getting too private. I need to cut it off from any groups. Making it a private journal is not an option right now. I'm thinking of forwarding this to Lor. She needs to see what i've written."

"event","so yesterday at the library, i get a text message from drew and apparently plans for boston are a-go. as in we will be in boston october 16-19th. we were planning this all via text message as he was on the water and i was in the hush-hush library pouring over math that i have no idea how to solve for the gre's. 
anyhow. to edit out the mess inbetween and leave half of me out of this, i just got off the phone with meg and it looks like i'll be staying with her. my meg! MY MEG. i am going to bring us tea and booze and ill finally get those severe shoes back that she has in her possession. but most of all and all in all, the most important part in this equation is <b> meg </b>. 
complications wont be mentioned, but they still exsist, but are put on hold because all i can think about is meg and then drew being in the same city and meeting. after what, almost THREE years? please please please go alright and please please please fall into place. its wonderful planning and if worse plans come to worse, i will spend the days with drew and then the nights with my lady(ies). 

oh my god, who knew this much trouble would come up from ashes and basically from no place at all?"

"event","my grandfather is drunk all of the time which is cool when its 12:30. reeeedic, actually im torn between ambivilence and abject anger. not because he is drinking, but because he is so annoying. he calls and leaves 3 minute messages on the machine, then calls me and tells me the same thing in slurred words and THEN the next morning doesnt even remember saying them. which you know, is totally forgivable behaviour, but after years it gets super old. and sad too cause nobody likes a drunken grandfather. 

i am also going to columbus to see various randoms from forever ago and will be driving for 2+ hours. im stopping at teh record store before hand obviously. hopefully steve wont be working because he always recommends the worst bands ever and tells me that i will love them. snob!

you are a wonderful wonderful clam and i am glad we are friends and so so style. we have matching clothes not even when our buyer make us wear nipple shirts. we share elfshoes and skirts and i bet our closets are like same :(. 

i wish you, the love of my russian life every bit of happiness you deserve and hope that all works out with xxxxxxxx. you are like a blooming russian flower and dont let anybody tell you otherwise. you are so smart and lovely and duh, instead of french, WHY NOT RUSSIAN? MMMM? do you want to be america?

no on serious note i love you very much and you can always have my clam hairs because i am so much prettier than you. OK FINE. but the clam offer is still good. you are like sunshine on a cold day in minsk. 

i know things are veryverycluttered in your life, but girlie, nothing is going to stop you and even if old navy stock goes down a few points, its okay because people will always buy shiny cargo pants. 

and i promise this to you : our marc jacobs shoes and pointy toed heels and even ballet slippers will always always be our signature style. 


love with all love,

1. M A R Y L A N D ! ! drew has the nicest family in the world and his grandmother gave me a jar of her pickles. UNFORTUNATELY SAID JAR WAS STOLEN. met really nice kids and all in all maryland was beautiful. 

2. black eyes show! met so many nice kids including kid named bonner who drew me a picture and whose name KEEPS coming up on my cell phone list. will remove name shortly. 

3. on the beach with drew was nice due to weather being beach weather and wading in the water JUST enough so that the bottom of my skirt got wet and then sitting in the sun reading a zine from the night prior. at some point drew got out of the water (he was swimming) and was drying off and i looked at him and said that he looked like a boy straight out of a paul bowles book. he did! 

4. singing along to music on the highway on the numerous drives and listening to bluegrass as we drove home from his mother's house. 


however. i am sunburnt, blistered, weary and constantly holding my phone to my ear far to much but its an affliction."

2. amazes me with songs and words even though half a world away. killlller mind. 
3. funniest and one of the most creative stars i know...things will work out because you are so incredibly sweet. together we tried to tame a fish... 
4. extremely talented, disciplined and beautiful- both inside and out. i wish i could convey this to her because i dont ever think she will realize it! 
5. fucking brilliant designer whose work i proudly don and get compliments on every time
6. oh this boy! i want to do dirty things with him. in multiples. he knows it and chooses not to care! also is extremely sardonic and witty...and a boy
7. one of my best friends and its weird to say that we have so much in common and i think we can chalk up so much of our friendship to aim even though weve known each other for so long. i honestly am grateful to be able to have a friend like her because not only is she divinely talented, but also has a heart of gold. 
8. letters always get written, but always get returned for some reason? i lean on her and vice versa- we share two friends that we laugh at often and im glad she is finally getting some much deserved happiness. she is one of the few that deserve it. 
9. i maybe-not-so-secretly admire you very much- the writing , the style, the life. she is glamorama and stunning- when you publish something, i will be the first in line (probably after the stalkers). 
10. i miss you very much and you havent been around for months. i do do love you and adore you quite possibly more that most people. we share so much in common that you are always in my thoughts. i hope i reach you soon.
11. has a tender heart and a creative mind. not just in music, but clothes (which people always remark upon) and a loving boyfriend that deserves every inch of her. 
12. i do not know him too well, but we share a friend who is MIA because of her dumb boyfriend. tell her tatu4life.
13. projects and music and photos need to be seen by world as they are obviously already a hit with your friends...me included even though we know each other more through comments than anything else. 
14. speaks german and english and i try to do my best to understand them both. it will be a pleasure getting to know her more. 
15. true fashionista in every sense of the word with an unhardened heart. i wish i could see the world through your eyes because you see it all! you are gorgeous and i would love to walk in your shoes. literally ! 
16. oh my. i think of the tapes you made me and how often i still listen to them and how i still have the bracelet you sent me and your sweet little voice! i miss you because we dont talk that often, but i think where you were over a year ago and smile because you are so much further. 
17. sweet hot thing! i wish i could come up with a new word for you, because darling, you sizzle! young little thing but your time is now and will still be there when i am old and dead.
18. you sir, are so far away but i love reading your updates and getting news on your various encounters and your life. 
19. i saved perhaps one of the best for last because i do do do adore you greatly and that is not a secret. you make me smile at work! and i write you obsessively, but that is because one day this summer we shall talk , drink, and excess together and still manage a bit of debauchery. considering living a life of debauchery is your norm and i love hearing every word and im glad youre back (not that you were ever gone). 
20. sheeesh this girl doesnt even read my livejournal because she is too too busy in france with her lovers and her wine vinyards and i dont mind because she leaves me hilarious im's to return to when i get home !

so. the debauchery begins. we head back to megs place, enjoying each others company and having pre-evening cocktails when we got a call from cheryl calling us to go out to a club. i know. so, figuring it was one of our last nights together, i eagerly agreed, having no idea what to expect. they rushed us girls in and instantly my eyes had to adjust to whatever lighting there was and the people people people that were there. i sort of wished i had known this place would be our eventual place as i felt a bit uncomfortable. ah well. so cheryl looked fucking smashing and sean was there with many of his friends and it seemed like i was shaking hands or hugging with half of the people present. so, wanting to explore, i went off by myself and on the way, had a few drinks...vodka and cranberry juice here and a drunken shirley temple there. it was enough (which is technically too much). 
<p>
by the end of the night, i got talking to d., which was super strange because i had 'known' him since 1999 via his radio show and newsletters and it didnt click until about ten minutes into us talking. it was strangely odd but quite funny as well. so grateful i was that he, like me, was not quite up to dancing so we sat there shouting into each others' ears. attempting at any semblence of actual conversation that went beyond 'WHAT?' 'WAIT, I DIDNT HEAR THAT LAST PART'.
<p>
then as the club was closing meg came over and suggested our best bet to get home was to start looking for cabs. luckily d had a car and drove us both home in no time. meg left for her apartment and d and i had a drink at my place before eventually closing my eyes at 5, knowing that that same day had a grueling 10 hour drive back home. i will probably never see or speak to d again, because not only will i only be returning to boston for weekends and graduation, it was one of those encounters that stand for themselves alone.

so i guess this has become, not an entry about drew, but people who i intensely care about. i would just as soon use that voouture to see my meg. and to say that drew is a meg is a big step for me but the difference is that i dont kiss meg....at least not on a regular basis.

i feel as if i have been a shady friend to her and everybody else. i have not been in the mood or state of mind to see them. i would have been a mess if they had seen me. i guess it is easier to hide behind a letter? that is why i am such a fan of them? eh? i dont know, i wrote one to drew tonight, which is illegible and a mess of chemical words and drunken advices. but its okay and it will be okay and no matter what <b> you </b> report or say to him, things will work themselves out. bother yourself with your own life before meddling in mine, K THX>>>>>>

P.S. WHILE I AM ON THE SUBJECT OF MISS JERALYN EVE MASON.....ISNT SHE THE MOST FANTASTIC CREATURE EVER TO HAVE EXSISITED? I KNOW I THINK SO <3333"

"event","paul died. he was my friend or whatever in hospice whose room i ran to when mimi died. i visited him the day of her wake and brought him flowers and easter eggs that i had made. we talked for a bit and i concluded at that time, that he had lou gerhig's disease. i found out in his obituary that he did. the last thing that he said to me was that he would tell mimi that i said hi. 

i wish things would just stop going so horribly horribly wrong because until this stops, i know what i must do every night or end up not sleeping. i am over my grandfather's when i am not at home. he is so alone for the first time in his life that i cant even think about it without honestly crying. he doesnt deserve this- paul didnt deserve to get such a heinous disease and fuckyougeorgebush for being antistemcell research which could have saved his life in another time. i find comfort in very little and dont even care about the things i once did very much. im not taking the blame, just cutting my losses. 

im going to boston tomorrow for a few days, packing my things and leaving. forever. i dont want to call meg. i dont want to call jackie. i dont even want to go. i want to just rid myself of everything that is there or has some connection, however vague, even if it is a killer pair of stilletos from england."

"event","i am super obviously irritated, or ""irate"". i give myself four days before i start climbing the walls. i swear off midway through day three and fall apart on day four in a state of anger and just frustration. i have not talked to meg in nearly too long and im tired of writing letters to an empty box. i did write to dan yesterday and im excited for him to receive it as i cant quite remember what i put in it other than the best elvis card ever. i am sick of being home with nothing and yet having things to do, but accomplishing none of them. graduate essay, what? applications? gre prep? <p>
i need to decide if i want to move down to washington dc in the fall. this partly depends on whether or not my internship could POSSIBLY a future job, in which case i would defer going to gradschool until winter. either way, i wont start school in the fall, but prospects for a job in cleveland are less than promising and ive heard washington dc is an alright shot. but i dont have any friends there and god knows im not going to single handedly h a n g onto drew for dear life. that would be not only horrible pressure, but surely detrimental to both parties involved. im just stuck and not particularly happy about any situation.

"event","it is entirely safe to say that sorting through my grandmother's things resulted in a treasure chest of medicinal benefits. i am venturing out tonight with heather and a few other various randoms. lately it seems like evenings are the only time i get any relief. this will soon change as work ushers in a new exsistence. <br> i feel really super something lately. and its amazing how many things can superficially change, but underneath, they really havent. part of me wants to settle into a new life, but then part of me is still sending letters all over the country trying to get a hold of something. there is such a beauty in letter writing and knowing as you write each letter and word that the recipient will be reading and holding the same piece of paper. i think its romantic and i like choosing each word and having as much time as i would like to pen each word. the only downside is not knowing  the immediate reaction. even more so, getting no reaction. 
miss sarahjean will be getting a letter soon. shhh. she is my furthest away penpal and one of the best <3. ive been writing to heather the longest. the letter for MOST letters in volume goes to meg or steve. letters of importance...that goes to drew. if you would email me your address, i would love to write you a real letter. seriously. im hoping dan will next."

science        = B-

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

i got new dance shoes they really nice. 

now i have to go to summer school math GRADE 8
that pissed me off.
but i learned that if i pass it they will bump me up a grade in math. so when im in the 7th grade i will have 8th grade math. finally i wont be considered an idiot.

im sick of every one hating me. ive never done anything to them. every one still hates me, its the way its always been. my so called ""mother"" hates me too. she takes so many of her problems out on me. she yells at me for no reason. so i have become ""mute"" around her. so she always asked me questions of what has happened to her ""sweet little girl."" she dosnt realize that im not her ""sweet little girl."" she hates me any way. why does it matter? 
im hidding to many things. im always about to cry. before i came to SASA everything was perfect, looks didnt really matter. my ""mother"" wasnt lesbian. i mean i dont have a problem with her being lesbian it just that she had boyfriends and she liked men. and BAM when she gets out of colledge SHIT SHES LESBIAN. 
and im not preety so to hell with a guy liking me.
 why is everything based on looks?

cause now this one kid knows.

i think i failed my art test too.
damn.

i hate my mom right now.
she yells at me and stuff, but that dosent bother me.
its when we get into an argument and she start going off and then i go off and shit. and then im the one i troble for no fucking reason.
i was getting ready to go to my dads and she started yelling at me for something i dont remember what. and then i a whole bunch of shit happened. and then i couldnt go to my dads.
she started to go off on me again. about how im grounded and that im not helping myself. I'VE BEEN GROUNDED SINCE SEPTEMBER! how can it get better? my life really sucks.

i wish i would run away. maybe move to new york. 

naw.wouldnt work. they would stop me then take me back. no matter what i cant get away.
only at school i am.
im starting to like school for some odd reason.
its the only place i can be myself.

i wish i was addopted. or had a brother or sister, then i wouldnt get blamed so much for things i didnt do.
she blame things on me. things i didnt do. things i dont know about. things that i couldnt do anyway. nope. i still get blamed.

i cant wait till the summer.
then i can go outside till 11:00pm and when i get home just do whatever and not have to see all these people.

not get blamed.

i cant deal with all of this stuff. its too much.

i cried for so long last night.
i dont remember why.
all the problems are too much.
its all too much.
everyone thinks im a happy kind off person.
no one realizes all of it.
i learned one thing, to keep your problems to yourself.
if you tell people things then they tell people.
and they dont understand.
no one understands."

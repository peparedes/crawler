Sam wants to hoover his room..... even though he has a cleaner to do it! Mad!"

One Hour Photo is on tonight. I've never seen before, it looks, well, weird really. Worth a watch though. 

Darrien and Holly won strictly Dance Fever!!! =D Hehe. I'm not sad, i just love dance. I wanted Holly to win from the beginning, she was always absolutely amazing. I can't wait until September where i can dance again!

I need to post Sam's good luck card, i was supposed to today but i got lazy, and now it isn't going to arrive in time. =(

The Spanish is going well, i got 90% 27/30 words. But i don't really feel like i know anything. I can say i don't like cheap wine and that i have a great house on the beach (only one of those is true) but that isn't really helpful for day to day conversation. But it is a great learning method the way they do it. 

Tomorrow i really need to get up and go to sainsburys and exercise or something. I know i wont want to do it when morning comes though.

"event","Why am i still so stressed and on edge? I didn't sleep at all last night, just kept tossing and turning, so in the end i watched repeated episodes of buffy. So now i am really tired, so i have been laying in bed going mad since 5am. Up at last, but still in a really bad mood. I was suppose to go shopping today, but i really can't be bothered as it will probably stress me out more. 

I'm really scared. I need to stop buying things. I don't have enough money. Having an overdraft really kind of makes you think you have more than you actually do, but i still have to pay that back. 

I feel ill, stupid stress. I need to calm down, but i don't want to, i do, but grrrrr. I feel really sick and on edge. I keep snapping at people. My poor mother is really getting the brunt of this at the moment.

This is suppose to be a relaxing holiday, but it is stressing me out so much!"

"event","So stressed! This total lack of interaction with people is really getting to me. I'm on edge, i'm fidgety, i'm crying for no reason half the time. I hate not talking to people. Either people have gone home or are revising for exams. I have things to do, but i can't be bothered to do them. 

I feel really happy about the rest of my life, but this is seriously fucking me over. I have had a permenant headache since Sunday and my face hurts from the tears. I was really sick yesterday, so i couldn't go see my Dad. I haven't even unpacked, so my room is making me more stressed because it is a total mess. 

GGGGGRRRRrrrrrrrrrr AAAARRRRHHHHHHGGGGGgggggggggg

I'm getting myself into debt because all i have to do at the moment is go shopping! I keep buying clothes that i don't need to cheer me up. Even Sam has started to notice my huge increase in new clothes and accessories and shoes. 

I've had so far 17 rejection letters from local schools to help out. Applied for so many jobs with no reply. I've emailed Artemis every day and nothing from them. I feel totally useless. 

I just want to go to sleep and it be June 10th or the beginning of July. I actually can't wait until next Friday when Mum comes up. She's the one i talk to the most, how sad is that?!

Rant over, didn't help one bit. =( I am happy, but this is driving me insane!!!!!

"event","Being back feels really strange. I've realised that i do not get sun in my room during the day, only early morning. so annoying.

Had a really nice walk through Hyde Park this morning. It was so hot, and lots of people were out. Dragged Sam out of his room for lunch on the grass, which was lovely.

Being back in this flat isn't too bad. Stu got serioulsy pissed off with Lira earlier because she wouldn't let him fry the beef until after they had all eaten the noodles and salad, as she can't stand the smell (stupid vegetarian!). He was really annoyed, and a TOTAL IDIOT! Why not just cook it. She should learn to put up with it, it is a very selfish trait. I would always cook it if she was in the kitchen when i was wanting to cook, it's a communal space. 

Really struggling to find a job here. And Dad is being non-existant like usual, and it's really getting to me. I want my father back."

I'm considering hypnosis, but it is just so expensive. I don't even know if it would work. Part of me would spend any amount of money if i knew it would help me. I really really want to be able to eat vegetables. I want to chomp on a carrot, eat a potato, eat tomatoes. Go on holiday to Asia or South America and actually be able to eat the foods. I hate this. It is really getting me down now that i have realised it is affecting my health. I don't like being ill. =(

They take their time replying to emails, which is very annoying when you are waiting with huge suspense, like when you wait on results day. As i will not pass this  year (officially) and will not be put in for the exams, i am waiting to hear whether i am aloud to stay here next term or if they are going to kick me out/make me withdraw. 

I don't want to go home, i'd just argue with my mum all the time. I know i hate it here, but as dad said, it is only money verses sanity. Do i go home and get my fees back, or stay here and have my sanity? The problem is that it isn't my choice anymore. And they haven't let me know yet!!! I hate waiting!

I have told Lira, and all she could say was ""poor Cherrie"", not 'poor cleaner' as she is the one who has to deal with their mess! It is Lira and Stu's own fault that Cherrie got shouted at.

I don't want to clean everything, as then they would just assume that i will give in and clean it every time. I will not! But i can't cook in such a kitchen, i couldn't even get to the oven/hobs yesterday.

"event","The state of our kitchen is too disgusting right now. I haven't been here, so i cannot be to blamed. There is dirty cutlery, pans, plates and hte like everywhere. There are tea towels which are just going to make things dirty again when used for drying. The bin is overflowing and has really made the room stink! I am sure there is something bad with that kettel, never been cleaned and i'm scared to drink the cup of tea i've just made. I actually cannot cook in that kitchen tonight, and i fear the cleaner will refuse to clean it again with that much mess. 

Sam came over on Wednesday and was somewhat horrified by the state of it (and that was without the bin being so bad). He piled everything into one corner.... i'm too scared of breaking things to do that. 

I am really concerned of getting ill from this kitchen. I know students are suppose to have messy kitchens, but it is just so unhygenic! You see all these shows like ""How Clean Is Your House?"", i bet if this kitchen was put on that show, they would have so much disgusting things to put into those round dishes! 

How on earth do you make people clean up after themselves?!?!?!

Rant over."

"event","Well i think i have chosen a 1000 word essay experiment, one on tarot cards. Now i just need to work out a way of critically appraising it. 

The 4000 word essay is pretty much a lost cause, even now i've changed it to language, the only new research out there seems to be sciencey rather than englishy!!!  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! I HATE THIS COURSE. You can't babble for 4000 words like you can for 1500. I don't think i can actually write 4000 words on this subject. 

My lab, still haven't started it. But i have a first in it now, so no longer need to put too much effort in.

Sam with tutorial essays. 

Getting frustrated with people over holidays, i don't particually want to plan another one (when i have so much work to actually do!), so that it just gets turned down again. So, i will put in my two pence and let them organise something. I have work too, and i find it a lot harder, and i HAVE to do it otherwise i will get chucked out. It is hard to even write a crap 4000 word essay if you don't understand any of the topics available to you!!! People don't seem to understand that. I may not care about the course, but it is still fecking hard work.

This wasn't suppose to be a rant. I need to get away from london. just for awhile. But i don't want to go home. 

It's been a long day, i haven't really done much, it's been more of a stressful/down day. Strange."

Going to start cooking nice fancy food now i have decided. I will be cooking a chicken and boursin (sp?) wrap, then the next day i will have rosemary lamb with herb or cheese polenta.

Aims for the year:
Go to one of the best (or best) University in London. 
Learn to drive and pass. 
Go on holiday. 
Eat more things. 
Get a job for a bit. 
Start to learn a language (Spanish) if possible.

Can't think of anything else.....

I feel a bit ill now. Not the greatest start to the year, but oh well. Do i have food poisoning? Hmmmm.. i've only eaten Oli's food, so who knows.

So definetly will not be going to Club Sandwich tomorrow night after the party, as he will be there wanting to buy me a drink. He creeps me out. Will avoid at all costs. He kept asking why i'm leaving, why don't i like it. Crikey. Not up to playing any sort of game with this guy, will just avoid and ignore. I cannot be bothered with him, even if he just wants to make friends now he's moved onto campus. I don't want anymore male friends! =P

Got the highest mark in an essay this week (not as good as Harry) but 65% (Upper second). I think it's great as i hate this course, damn proud of myself, and Sam for cutting my word count and explaining the science to me.

"event","Does anyone detest me applying for Fashion Management??

So much for proper degrees like everyone else, i gave up on that idea, they are all so dull (no offense).

Not likely to get accommodation though, but it is the only place that does it (London College of Fashion that is). It seems like such a great degree. It is management but without the dull parts and put into fun terms. Like when you explain something like a maths equation using how many pairs of shoes, instead of numbers. It is just like that! 

Or there is Public Relations at London College of Communication. Sam said he saw me in PR.

I don't know where to live though. =|"

"event","I am back home now, and it is horrible. Well, it's weird, room is empty, etc. But the horrible thing is, Mum is so proud of me for getting into Goldsmiths, she has been telling everyone and she just wont stop smiling when she mentions it. And i am about to break her heart and reapply through UCAS to do another degree, and it really hurts me to have to lie to her and tell her everything is okay, when its not. I don't even know what i want to do, i am thinking of english/linguistics, sociology, not really sure. Need to do my research. But i don't want people to think less of me because i'm going from a respected uni/course, to maybe not so. Sam used to always look down on sociology as if it were an easy subject for people who want to flunk.... but i find things like that interesting, does that make me not want to work? Hmmm. Madonna has told me over and over again, don't let myself be socialised by those around me into thinking some degrees/universities are not as good as others. I know she's right, but i don't want to let people down. Maybe UCL will take me, but they'll interview me and i'll screw up... so will i end up in a degree which offered CCC. Gah i hate this. I don't understand how people know what they want to do. I enjoy maths (but i didn't do A Level) and Communication Studies, but there is no such degree, or it is too media specific. Figures crossed Peter Symonds will let me take AS Maths in January, just for fun. Does that make me sad?

My comma has fallen off again. It is 11:30 at night and i am so tired. Hopefully tomorrow will be amazing: cinema and meal out with Sam, then meet Eddie for drinks in the evening. 

Need to do my lab report tomorrow! Hope everyone is having a fantastic time at uni.

I have made a few friends, Yan, who is sitting opposite me, is great to talk to. Lira - is an utter two-faced bitch. Gave me a hug this morning and asked to borrow more Friends DVDs, yeah right! I'm not being judgemental either (like Sam), but she is, she makes fun of me because i'm feminine! Great excuse. Otherwise, next door flat people are great to hang out with, much more friendly and lively - i would suit that flat more, but that doesn't matter. 

Findind the course SO hard. The only thing at the moment i am enjoying on the course is at the beginning of each chapter there is a history bit, today i learnt about Descartes philosophy of science and religion - that was interesting! I like taking part in others experiments, did a tarot card reading test today, which was so weird. 

Have a skittles vodka brewing in my room, and waiting for Sam's friend to teach me how to torpedo (sp?) a Reef. 

Bad chest pains, so going now.

Settled into my flat nicely, most of them are really nice, two sometimes three seem to be pretty absent most of the time (two being american, so with their american friends). Saturday night i went out with Sally (ed likes her) and Stu and met some people. Sunday i went out with Yan. Monday i went out with Yan, Stu and Lira. Tonight.. who knows.. maybe Yan and Rachel. Nice people here.

Eddie came up to see me for like 20 minutes yesterday, which was nice but hurried. Maybe i will see him tomorrow. But Sam is coming up tomorrow to see me, so i am very happy! =D I don't really have much to do during the day as people do their own things. But i have tried to have 3 meals a day, going well so far. Sam seems to be on a one meal a day diet, very bad for you!

Just in an internet cafe as i didn't want to go to the library on my own, but Yan and Rachel are here with me. It took me 3 hours to enrol earlier!! Talked to an American girl in the first hour long queue, but for the rest the two people next to me where on their phones/mp3, stupid antisocial people!!!

Hope to see you all soon!

Hehe. So, as soon as possible, we should do it again!!!!!!!

I am not really excited yet, just nervous and tired and sick. Wish it was another week away, but i guess i just have to get it over with. I'm not really looking forward to never having any alone time, i like my alone time, i am so going to have to have hour-long showers to get time on my own. At least after a week i get to go see Daddy and my brother and sister, a proper meal and my old bed; also pick up the more homely things that will make my room nicer. Will stay over Saturday night, as a Kanye West album launch party is really not my thing, however many freebies you get. Katie is not going to like this. Will get someone to pick some up for me to send to her.

Harry, you have to keep this LJ up if you can at Uni, so i get to read about how things are going with you. 

You know you love me x x x Don't know when i will see you after tomorrow though. =("

Sam gave me food poisoning (he denies it) yesterday, so i'm still a bit iffy today. Sam has ""man flu"". Not fair! This is my last week at home, i want to see him. Get out of bed lazy boy.

But there are so many clubs i want to join! I want to do this volunteering thing called open book, as working with people with mental problems would be great experience for a Psych student. I want to do skiing, absailing (if it actually is included in the climbing), jazz (but costs a bomb, need gym membership for it), radio or magazine, maybe some random society. So much!

My room is a total tip! I was asked to sort out clothes, but there is no room to even unpack the shopping i did on Friday.

I need boots!!!!!!! I have searched everywhere for a nice pair. May go on a new search for a black pair, i do have brown boots. I want a pair to actually wear all day and all night, not having to hobble home with aching feet after a long night out. Flat boots that i so utterly comfy.. come here.. i need you."

I want to go home, i will tomorrow. Sam may not be coming back until Tuesday now, as he may have to go overland with Tom. That ferry from Greece to Italy takes forever if they are going that way!

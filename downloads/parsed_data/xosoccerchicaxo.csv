[Liliam Worte the rest of this]
Anywayz Cynthia and everyone else think it was funny that I cried yesterday, Because of a Soccer Game.  But when i called Tori she said that she had cried as well.  Then we started talking about the game, my mom thinks its funny cause whenever Tori and I talk its either about Manchester or soccer related.  But I almost started crying when we were talking about it.  But yea....

But it was great!  Her name is Adrianna but i call her Adri.  She is only three months older than i am.  I am going to her Quince on April.  Mine is exactly three months after hers!  So if you wanna come, then send me and email at RonaldoxBeckham@yahoo.com or on First Class.  You can also talk to me on AIM (XXSoccerchica8XX).

Well i was happy talking to my cousin cause we have been ""BEST COUSINS"" for ever. That is what we used to call each other cause we would hang out 24-7!  She doesnt like Green Day, Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, and My Chemical Romance.  I think they are the bomb.  But like I fond out that she likes Chad Michael Murray.  



LOL well lets see i also found out that my dama dress is also the dress that my cousin, Adri is using.

Well Albert isnt here and Cynthia wants to go to my Quince with Josh."

When we got to the mall we went to see what movie we were gonna see, we decided to go and see Boogeyman.  Well it didnt start till 7:15 so we went to the mall and hang out.  We went to eat at 7:55 and then we saw Mr. Kimball.  Emily wouldnt say hi to him but whatever.  Well when we got back to the theater, the line was really really long.  So we missed the movie and so we bought tickets for 8:15.  Well we went back to the mall and we we went to claires, and i got a charm bracelet and two charms for it and then we were gonna get this best buds forever necklace for me cynthia and emily, but we decided that we should wait until cynthia is there so we can all choose together.  Well then i got this keychain that said soccer on it.  Well then we went to Hot Topic and we bought a book from the happy bunny. Well then we went to the movies.  But we went ran into another problem, there wasnt enough seats.  So we sat seperated during the previews.  and then she came and got me cause there was an empty seat next to her.  Well basically everyone and the whole damn theater were screamin!!!!!  It was hilarious cause they were mostly blonde!!  not saying anything about blopndes but like the snobby blondes!  anyways it was funny."

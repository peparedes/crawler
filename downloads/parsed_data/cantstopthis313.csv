"event","Well things have been alright. Been working a lot lately. Tomorrow is my last day of work until sometime after christmas which will be a nice little break. Work is boring but i need the money. Haven't been up to much at all hung out with john a few times and that is pretty much it. I kind of miss the batting cages the one place where i wasn't worried about anything that was going on in my life.It was just me concentrating on the ball an the only sound of naggin or talking is when the ball an the bat connected. Only place where you could swing you anger off. I kind of need that right about now. It is weird it is always when something falls apart in your life everything decides to fall apart at once. First your car breaks,your realtionship breaks, and then friendships start to break. But i guess that is life. Got to have a curve ball in there everyonce in a while to keep you off guard. Kind of makes me wonder what lies around the next bend in my life.Well i hope everyone is doing well. Peace"

I am going to school this winter at schoolcraft which should be fun except not really. I am just taking two basic classes. Besides that everything has been going well. I got raises at both of my jobs which i was happy about cause i honestly could use the money.I need money for school and my tires on my car are bald which mean me an snow don't like each other.I hope everyone is doing well.

because i need you more than you need me
because i want you more, i know

because we move too fucking fast
i think i really had to wish to make this last, i know

i'm sorry please forgive me, believe me if you would

because i cared way more
because i really felt that you felt so much more, i know

i'm sorry please forgive me, believe me if you would
i'm sorry please forgive me, believe me if you could

"event","This is my second update for today. i have something on my chest i have to get off an since i can't say it to this person i will put it in here. I forgive both of you. As quick or sudden as that sounds i can mean it. Though i was hurt by it I am not longer hurt by it. An my anger has greatly dropped. An me being mad at either one of you will do nothing for me it only hurts me. I want everyone to start moving on with there lives and i can't watch people being hurt or still hanging on to this. Truth is i got off the easiest between me an ashley. But I believe that i need to move on an i can't if i still hang on to this. Though i won't forget what happened i am not longer hurt or angry at you. This is not an invitation to start a friendship again or anything like that this is just letting you know i made peace an time to move on. Maybe sometime in the future we will run into each other again but this whole thing has just caused a lot of problems. Maybe i am being to nice of a guy but it is not worth someone hurting themselves or stopping there life over this. Am i saying what you did was right, no but you can't hang on to it anymore. It happened it is over time to move on. So thank you to everyone who helped me and hopefully next time we meet it won't be like this again."

"event","Well this definantely has not been the best of weeks but i think i can finally say i am doing alright and moving on. An i am happy about that. That means i can finally start getting on with my life and i know in time i will be over this. But on that not this is my last thing that i have to say about this whole situtation.

GONE

Kind of messed up how you can only say sorry on-line.
Can't call or say it to my face, can't take that time?
Whatever time I Move on with my life.
I can't win them all, I can't always be right.
An sometimes we all must loose.
Especially when someone can't stay true.
But I'm not complaining you taught me a lot.
I need to choose better and thats all you taught.
An if i may give ou a word of advice.
Before you date anyone else make a sacrafice.
An speaking of true, what about your best friend.
She's the one who got screwed over in the end.
But now it's time that i move on
AN ME & YOU ARE NOTHING BECAUSE... I'M GONE!


Thats all i got to say. Thank you to my friends who were there for me i really appreciate it. An i will not forget what you did for me. An i guess this is a lesson. Next time i will be more careful and take people's warning even if i don't like what they have to say."

So i don't get asked anything just me an shannon are not together and if you want to know why ask her. It is amazing. I am a really nice person and i have never hated anyone in my life but my rage and hate has taken control of me. THough i know i am only hurting myself by hating her i can't think straight. I obviously was wrong about her. God.. what the fuck did i do to you? I wish i never met you and that may just be the rage in the mood i am but i didn't want none of this bullshit. I don't deserve it an now you just fucked up everything. How am i suppose to trust someone else. I can't even feel bad for you. I am just glad it is not on my concious."

They laeft pretty early and then i went over ashleys to hang with her,mike and shannon. Kind of spent the night and went home the next morning. Then friday i slept a lot and then fixed my car and then me and shannon, matt, and mike went to a few party's. That was a ton of fun. Saturday i worked and hung out with clarey who is doing well. Definantely going to go visit him up at MSU. Then sunday i hung out with ashley and mike and shannon again.

"event","Well i guess i have been alright i just need to blow off some steam. Like i am not mad but i am frustrated. On a happier note me an shannon made it offical but anywas i am just frustrated that tonight was a waste and i guess it is no one's fault just really shitty communication between everyone. See me,greg,ashley,an shannon were suppose to hang out tonight. SO they got done with there stuff about 7:30 so i call them and we were thinking of stuff to do when mike calls and says you want to go bowling and pretty much we thought from what we were told that it wouldn't be to later so ashley told greg a later time an they ended up going earlier. So then we started to make plans between us and decided that us four would just go and we were going to go to merri bowl but just about the time we were suppose to leave shannon got sick off something she ate so she went home sick and i guess i am just frustrated cause i really wanted to do something tonight but that all got ruined so i ended up not doing anything for 2 an a half hours. Not much you can do by yourself when your car is broke so i had to get that out cause it just really frustrates me. Cause i work all day and i was looking forward to tonight and nothing happened. My dad always made fun of me cause i never get excited about things but i am not very optimistic. But that is just me. But i don't want anyone who reads this to think i am blaming them i am just blowing off some steam. Cause no where does it say someones name and say it is there fault. But that is it."

But luckily it wasn't really obvious on me. My cheeks weren't really puffed out so i could talk fine. I pretty much slept most of friday and later towards the night mike stopped by an i hung out with shannon. Then saturday my sister got proposed to so she is now engaged so congrats to her. It was also my uncle's b-day so i went over there with mike and saw the rest of the family. Then later that night me,mike,ashley,and shannon hung out. We went to starbucks and then greg and ashley went there way, mike dropped me an shannon off at my house and we just hung out. Today i am not to sure what is up. I should probably be constructive but i won't so if u want to do something hit me up. later"

I was mowing a lawn and found so high school kids wallet with like 400 dollars in it so i decided to be nice an return it to him and he tips me 100 dollars so i was like kick ass. I mostly worked all day friday so that really was the only high light i had. Yesterday was  homecoming and i went with shannon which was fun. Not a fan of bahamma breeze though i was not really impressed but it still was fun going there. The dance was fun to though they didn't start playing good music til like 9. afterward me,greg,ashley,an shannon went to some sushi place where they had karaoke and that was funny to watch. Ashley and shannon singing ""I'm a barbie girl"" that was to funny. I was doing so well that night to with not making a mistake and then i went to pass shannon some type of sushi and i spilled it on her leg and thank god just missed her dress but i felt really bad about that. Afterward we went back to ashleys and watched a movie for a while then i had to go home an sleep and now i am here. All in all it has been a great week. hope everyone is doin alright."

Then we went to the reception which was alright. Cause i am not big on dancing but i did a few times. I left about 12:30 so i could get some sleep. An today was totally awsome. I went to work then left and went with Kim to battle of the bands in detroit. her friends were performing in it and then ended up winning which was really cool. i just had a really great time with her. She is a lot of fun is not the person i thought she was which is a good thing. She has a great personality and has a good heart and honsetly past is past nothing you can do to change it an i know myself am not perfect and i sure as hell wouldn't want my past to be held against me. But i just had a wondeful time with her and i took her home and i am hoping to hang out with her later. This last week just talking to her and getting to know her just made me realize sometimes first impressions may not be good but you have to get to know the person before you can really tell. Cause i thought she was this crazy, partying, easy girl but that isn't who she is really. I mean she is crazy but not in a bad way and she does party but not every single day and she isn't easy. But anyways i am just in a great mood."

"event","Well last week was definantely rememerable and sad. Spent most the week hanging out with mike which was cool we did a lot of different stuff an saw a lot of people i hadn't seen before they took off to college. Friday was by far a crazy night for me. Went to robin's and she had like a little get together. I got totally trashed it was horrible. I had 5 smirnoff twisted, two shots of some 50 dollar tequila, two shot of vodka, and two beers. I threw up everywhere which i felt bad about but i definately didn't know my limit. I decided to a break from drinking. 

Saturday there was another get together so i went there and decided to stick to water lol. It was still a crazy night. I met this girl named kim and i must say she is definantely crazy. Didn't even know this girl and ended up seeing her naked but i ain't going to go into detail. She ended up giving matt her number to give to me. 

Sunday i didn't do to much at all. I mostly rested and later hung out with matt. We stopped by Casey' cause john left monday so we were saying good bye before her left. I am going to miss him. He is awsome. Then we stopped by Young's party for a very short time. We ended up hanging out at matt's girlfriends until matt got in trouble so it kind of cut our night short. 

This week is busy. Thursday i have to pick up my tux for my cousins wedding then i have to go to a party for my cousins fiance then i have to stay the night at my sister's to watch her dog. Friday i have the dinner rehersal. Then saturday is showtime for my cousins wedding which will be fun.

I love my girls they are so much fun and i know they support me on everything i do which is all i need. Like my dad said all you need is the love of your true friends, your family, and god. An i agree i don't really consider people friends when i barely know anything about them and have barely known them. So if people wonder how i can just drop friends like that it is because i don't consider you a friend. As harsh as that sounds all my friends i have know i have known at least a year. Most of them i have known 5-9 years. 

I am just glad this weekend is over cause i feel this week is a fresh new start you know. What is in the past is in the past. An that is how it should be left. ""Everything happens for a reason, even if you don't know the reason"" but i am just hoping everything is dropped on both sides and we can just go our seperate ways. Leave it at that.

Michelle probably had it the worst but i wasn't to thrilled either but life is to short to be mad sometimes you win sometimes you loose i will just add another one to lost but i still have her as a friend so. 

My win and lost record is starting to look like some of my high school baseball records =P. Tuesday was alright wasn't very productive just sort of driving and talking and hanging around so not a ton to talk about there. Today i still haven't really done anything except get stuff ready so i can leave friday for up north and maybe some time alone will give me a chance to just get my mind off things and just clear my head some. Cause right now i don't want anymore drama for me or anyone around me i just want to relax and have fun. 

So i am fine though not hurt or anything like that got to learn to deal with things you know. If you can't learn to deal with things you will never move on with life you will stay stuck and that is not what i want. But hopefully everyone is doing well and i hope everyone is enjoying there summer.

"event","Well tonight was definantely and intresting night. We decided not to go to the huka lounge but to bring the huka to one of kyle's friends house. so we get there and we are smoking the huka and stuff. It made me really sick. Though it was fun over there i mean Amber and Michelle were a fun show to watch ;). We all pretty much just sat there wathing the movie which was fun while others passed the huka around.

Well me an amber so i could take her home. Well just about the time we get to amber's michelle called. Not good new i am not going into detail but her and kyle got into a fight and she didn't have much gas, or money, or know how to get out so me and amber raced back there. Amber drove the car and i gave the girls gas money and it was just not good so the night ended on a rough note.

But i want you girls to know that i am always here for you and there is nothing i wouldn't do for you. If you need anything or need help just call i will be there as soon as i can. An i felt bad cause michelle was really upset and hurt. An i want Amber to know that if i ever did something like that to kick me as hard as you can. I want you to know i really do like you and there is nothing i wouldn't do for you. I am here for both of you."

"event","The last two nights have been great. Last night i hung out with Michelle and Amber which was great two girls and one guy =P. We drove around everwhere looking for a movie we couldn't find. AN then we stopped by my house and michelle fell in love with the romantic pond area. Than we hung out at ambers which was fun. I had my plea out to women..well there is only one i was pleading to;). Than i left there and went to bed. 

ANd today me michelle kyle and amber hung. we drove to the factory and it was creepy cause we saw this car when we passed and we like went like around a corner and turned around and it was gone when we came back. Then we went driving around and it was cool cause the moon was a weird color and heat lightning was everywhere. AN it was nice just riding around especially with amber. Got lost a little but found our way back and now tomorrow we are suppose to hang again.

Hope everyone is having a good summer."

"event","Girl I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream (my dream)
All, anything to have you on my team (I don't care baby)
All, baby girl I'd trade it all (I'd trade it, yeah)
Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring (oh yeah)
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl I'd trade it all


I agree what the point of having that all if you don't have anyone to love. I would rather have someone to love than have all the money in the world. The way i see it all i do is go to work. I have money, i have a car, but really if i had the chance and found a girl who loved me as much as i loved her i would get rid of it in a second if i had to.Just don't get it. I just can't seem to catch a break anywhere. Me and women go together like the  KKK and a NAACP convention. Just doesn't work out. Can't seem to find that girl that wants to hang out or showes me she is intrested which sucks. I feel just like no matter what i do or what i don't do things just don't go my way. 

Anyways last two nights have been pretty boring. Met Michelle's boyfriend and his friend mike which are cool but i really wanted to do something. Tonight went by Amber's but she was busy going to a movie so i just took michelle and kyle and mike to her house and she took them home and now i am here. Tomorrow i will go to work til 8 than just go home. Just not in the best of moods really. 

Whats The Deal:

I can't seem to smile there is no one in my arms
There is a hole in my heart and a empty seat in my car
There is no one to rush to, there is no one to hold
So i stand out by myself in this bitter cold
No one rushing to kiss me and say i missed you
Just the real world saying this is life go get a tissue
I just don't get the issue, what's wrong
Can't anybody just come along
If you need money i got it
If you need a ride jump on it
If you need love just come to me
If you need a good time come to me
But things just never come to be
My only love is the chain of the bills
That takes my money and gives no thrills
On;y dishes out that cold bitter chill
SO i stand in this cold waiting for a sign
As there goes all the time 


well that is all i have to say. nothing really that great to reflect on. oh yea my b-day is next sunday. yay (sarcasm) well later"

"event","Wow definantely has been an intresting week. I got wrote up at quiznos. Supposidly some lady came up at like 15 minuets to close and she complained that we looked closed and i we rushed her through the line. Funny thing is WE NEVER HAVE A DAMN LINE!!! An the fact it took her two days to file to complaint all i can say is what a BITCH! It is all cool though my work was dumb and left out her name and phone number =P.Anyways besides that have been really busy with work. Been hanging out with amber lately which i have no problem with. Though it is a little bit of a drive it is worth it. I really feel like playing baseball. I miss it so much. But i missed all the summer leagues so i have to wait on that. Really haven't keep in touch all that well with everyone. Chris leaves tomorrow for Indiana. So that kind of sucks. Though monday was fun when we traded sub boxes. Lets just say no way in hell is my new sub box coming back out. that is one tight fit. But i hope everyone is doing well and there is only 11 days til my b-day. Yay! Peace out"

"event","Well this week has been crazy. I have had a lot of work to do but not a lot of free time. Though the radio hasn't been to much help. You listen to all these people talking about dating and relationships and you get the songs like Frankie J ""How To Deal"", Miriah Carey ""We Belong Together"" and Bow Wow ""Let Me Hold You"" kind of depressing for me. I don't know i am just realizing i haven't met anyone in a long time and believe me where i work there is no one so i guess my question is how am i gonna meet someone?

I mean it is not like high school where you get new classes or new friends and meet someone new it is the real world. I guess i am just afraid that I won't find anyone for a long time and god knows how shy i am. Not like i am just going to go up to a girl and ask for a number. A lot of people are also busy. haven't really hung out with a ton of people. Just the same old same old really.

Well i should hit the hay seeing how i have to be up at 8:30. Yea it blows but i could use the money. Hope everyone is well and call me sometime.  (313) 530-8114."

"event","I was sitting down the other day and i was reading someone's journal and they were talking about how they hated being single and how they wanted someone to like them for them and didn't want to use them and wanted to find that someone. An how no matter how they looked they couldn't find them.

That got me thinking that someone is already in front of us. Think hard about all those friends and people you talk to that are always around you. If you look twice you may notice things like how they liked you at some point or how what you seek in the oppoisite sex that they have a lot of those characteristics. If you ever noticed most of your friends have the same traits and personality characterisitcs that you seek in someone.

See i know my problem when it comes to that is not that i can't find those traits but it is the whole package i can't find. I don't just want someone who likes me for me and is kind and funny but i also want someone who i am attracted to and have a connection with. When we say all we want is someone to like us and appreciate us it is not true cause i know in everyone's life we already have had an encounter with someone like that or still do what we really want is the whole package.

Sure someone can like you for you and want to be with you but it is that connection which is key to all of that. It has to be the all around package not just the small things. 

Probably wondering why i am talking about this. Well see i just want to open people's eye that even though they may have all those things your looking for the key is the connection or the chemistry between the two for better words. That is the key to finding someone is the connection. It doesn't matter what music they like, there movie choice, there clothing style, but the connection between the two. If there is strong connection than all of that is pointless.

Anyways besides that life is going good i am alive and taking life one day at a time. besides that i have nothing to say so take it easy."

"event","Well i wouldn't say this summer is great so far has been quite boring really. Same routine and i can not do the same thing over and over it is to boring. I have called so many people just no one i can seem to get a hold of. Abby i have called the last three days so either i mad her mad or she is busy.

I don't know i just feel like the only time i am happy is..... never actually. I just don't see a reason to smile and be happy. I could careless i got a lot of money no offense i am thankful but what does money get you. The subs are fun to pound to but what fun are they by yourself. I guess all i want is to be with my friends and be doing something.

I don't know really i don't even know why i am typing this most everyone is busy. I guess it is a way for me to think and bitch to my self and get it off my chest. But i hope everyone else is having a good summer."

"event","Well things have been going alright i guess. My grad party was fun i guess thanks to all of you that came i appreciated it. I don't know i feel like down some what.I feel bad for abby cause her dog got hit by a car and ryan told me that they had to put it to sleep so i feel bad for her. But i don't want any drama this summer so i am going to try my best to advoid it but my nature won't allow that.

i seems to get really upset very easily. I just don't want to put up with people who claim to be friends and you have to hunt them down to get a hold of them or they blow you off that i won't put up with this summer life is to short to wait on people. I hope everyone is doing well and has a great summer. I am going to try to keep in contact with people but i make no promises.

Well I am out best of luck to you all"

"event","Well it has been a while since i updated. I am graduted and no longer in school which is good and bad. Good cause i can finally do what i want and enjoy things bad because there are people i don't get to see to often that are still at school. I went to the spring banquet on monday and it was by far the best one for me. I won four awards. I got best offense, coaches award, mvp, and 1st all confrence. So it was an exciting night for me.
  
   Everything is still the same old same old though. Have been working and trying to enjoy these summer days though they are pretty hot. Luckly i got my pool open. I really don't have much to say really. So i guess i will end with that.

"event","Wow it has been crazy since thursday. The last walk was sad but i didn't cray i held that in. I miss people except Abby cause i have hung out with abby more these last five days than i usually do which has been fun. Friday night went and saw longest yard which was pretty funny. Saturday i went to the batting cages with a whole bunch of people. It was funny cause after we were going to go to a place for ice cream. So Garrison called ryan and was like why don't we go to Big Boy's or cold stone. Well ryan heard it as why don't we go to big boys and get some coleslaw. That was pretty funny.

Sunday i had people over my house and we watche whit noise. It was an intresting movie. Monday i went to my uncles for a bbq. But i wasn't feeling the greatest so i went home and got some sleep. Than tuesday was districts for basebal.. We lost and that is when i cried. Last time i will ever play for clarenceville again or Mike,Josh, and Jason. But i was the only player to loose it. After i dropped off abby and went to L. Georges for dinner with them. Than went to john's and watched cadddy shack. I also got to see Andrea yesterday which was nice.

"event","I don't get it. Why do people always want to try and change you? They are always complaining about something you do or a habbit you have or you outlook on things. I am sorry if i am not optimistic like a lot of people i know. I am sorry my experiences have shaped me to be negative. But that is from my EXPERIENCES. That is what shapes us. Our experiences, our up's and our down's. 

I can not say i had great high school experiences at all. Matter fact i would say my senior year is the only year i like. I do think a lot and yes i am usually not the happiest person but that is me. I don't see what everyone else see's. If you can except that than don't be my friend. If you can't just like me for me than all your doing is wasting your time. It took years for me to have this view your not going to change it in a matter of days or minuets. The only thing that i liked most through high school was baseball and writing. Besides that really there was only a few people i could stand.

People just need to see i am what i am. It is not like i was happy all the time and went to being sad. I have never really been all that happy. The only time i am happy is when i am either fishing or writing or playing baseball or around certain people i know that don't mind me. All i ask is if you are my friend than except me for me. Unless i come to you and ask for your opinion or your help just keep it to yourself. An i mean that in the nicest way possible. I didn't write this as an attack at anyone or any person but i have been hearing it to often and i don't want to hear it anymore.

God made me in his image. THis is what i am now so except it or leave it. Cause I know true friends can and others can't. And if you can't than obviously we weren't meant to be friends.

If Nobody Believed in you

I watched him take the two strike call:
He hadn't tried to swing at all.
I guess he'd had all that he could take,
He walked away, for goodness sake.
His father's voice was loud an' mean:
""You won't amount to anything.""

That little boy quit tryin',
He just walked away.
There were teardrops on his face.
Tell me, how would you feel?
You'd probably give up too,
If nobody believed in you.

That old man said: ""One more try,
""I know I'm not too old to try.
""I promise, son, I'll do my best,
""This time, I'm gonna pass the test.""
""Give me the keys, Dad, an' get in.""
His father never drove again.

That old man quit tryin',
He just turned away.
An' there were teardrops on his face.

We take His name out of schools.
The lawyers say it breaks the rules.
Pledge of allegiance can't be writ,
An' under God, should not be said.
I wonder how He will take.
I just pray it's not too late.

What if God quit tryin',
He just turned away?
There were teardrops on his face?
Tell me, how would you feel?

Well i have been in alright moods since my last entry. I am still on the team and things have been working out. I decided not to go to prom. I am not big on dancing and i saw no reason to really go. It is over rated.
 
I really didn't do anything this weekend. I just kind of worked and helped my family out. I am not sure if i am going to go on senior skip day or not. i want to but i am not sure at this point. 

I got to thinking last night. I was reading Cathryn's journal about true love. How do you know when you find it and what if you passed it up. Got me thinking. But i know the best way to find it is to take chances and take risks.I always know though that something will some around or look up.

I am so glad school is almost over. i really just want to leave and than worry about missing it once i am out. But that is all i have to say."

"event","This has probably been the worse week in a long time. I will try to make my reason as clear as possible. It all started with baseball. As most of you know i have a job which requires me to work. Well on occasion i have to work on the same day i have practice. What does this mean? I have to usually leave work about 5 o' clock to go to work. which also means i usual miss about a half hour or hour of practice. Well that happened on thursday so i was benched along with jason who also has work. Now i am not one to usually get mad but a player who's mom told him he wasn't suppose to play cause of his grades and the coach knew put him into pitch when me and maples who are both pitcures have to sit. That was one thing but then when he put in a new pitcher to relieve cody who had just got done pitching wednesday and who;s arm was dead that was the line. Now coach claims he has strict rules yet most the players who do get benched for missing practice, doing something ignorant, or bad grades usual at some point in the game get put in but me and maples who have to leave cause our parents don't pay for everything get punished. I was humiliated because my whole family came to watch me play and coach saw them and would not put me in. After all the things i have done for him, all the hard work, and this is how he re-pays me. So now if coach is not willing to allow me to leave early once a week for work and will keep benching me i will have to choose between the sport i love or work and sadly baseball will not win. What a great coach huh?

   And i am just not listening to people anymore. People like to talk and get your hopes only to be disappointed. Just remember if you hear something from someone else don't believe until you hear it from the persons mouth. Like if someone says they think a person likes you don't believe unless you hear it from that person a piece of advice to keep in mind. I don't know it just seems to me girls just want to be friends and they don't understand why guys get upset about it. Well after hearing that time after time when you like a girl it is not exactly what you want to hear you know. I just do not like that phrase maybe cause i hear it to often. An prom i have decided not to go. I just think i would be happier that way. I am like my father he never liked social gatherings or dances or dancing in general so in a way i am like him. Not much to highlight things have been pretty rough on me. An i am looking for the positive but it is kind of hard to see right now. I have high hopes things will turn out better.

   Tomorrow is my sister's b-day so i get to go to a family bbq which is fine by me. But this has been a pretty bad week and weekend. I thought it be great seeing how i got work off but i guess not. Hopefully everyone else has had a better week."

I failed gutman's class this card marking. We are struggling in baseball but hopefully we can get going. I am not to sure if we will have a game tomorrow it is hard to tell with all the SNOW?! Last two home games are 4-29 and 5-4 so you better some or else i will hunt you down. I am still unsure if i am going to prom I asked someone but they have yet to give me a definate yes or no so i am not sure at all. THough i am thinking about going just to see kurt dance lol. This weekend has been pretty busy. I got some new clothes and shoes which i needed really bad and watched some really weird western movie last night. I tell you what is was about but i am not sure. But anyways that is all that has been going on.

More love to you than walking into a pole."

I got to meet amber on thursday and she is a really cool girl. We have been talking lately trying to get to know each other which is nice. Than i pranked called someone on thursday which was funny cause she got all scared cause she thought it was a real teacher and found out it was me so i had a good laugh. Other than that is has just been work and baseball.

Yea i was talking to porter last night and realized something.... i still have feelings for cathryn which means that sadly i can't be friends right now i need time. i felt bad telling her that today just looking at her and knowing that i had to say that it was hard. But i know time heals all an i know eventually i will be able to move on an maybe we can be friends in the future. I don't know though only time will tell. Well i am pretty tired so i am going to hit the hay and will talk to ya'll later.

I concluded my week working and watching family guy along with going to greg's b-day party today which was fun. I don't want to go back to gutman cause well IT IS GUTMAN! Baseball all this week which is going to suck along with work and  homework but hey let us see how well i can do.
But i am not mad anymore i am like a woman i go through mood's but i am good now so it is all good.

I stand here by no one's side
I stand here ready to cry
I stand here with a hole in my heart
I stand here by i don't know why
I stand here can't say good-bye
I stand here as you walk away
I stand here all the day
I stand here our last spot
I stand here with no motivation to move
I stand here because i lost you
I stand here not knowing what to do
I stand here not knowing which way to step
I stand here cause fear got the best
I stand here waiting for someone to come my way
i stand here for that special day
I stand here for someone to come a new
I stand here for someone true
I stand here waiting for the one to stand next to me
So i can move just her and me.


Wow not bad writing this in only five minuets. Sometimes i amaze myself

[Intro - 50 Cent]
Ahh man
You know where the niggas be at right?
Take me to 'em

[Chorus- 50 Cent]
All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin'
I'm supposed to die tonight
niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay
I'm down to ride tonight
We crawlin, whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm down to ride tonight
We smokin', straight locin', locked and loaded
Somebody gon' die tonight

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
This is nothin' new, I been in the position before
Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door
Different day, same shit, old mac, new clip
Thirty two hollow tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin', I have 'em tongue kissin' my tec
Wanna come test me, pussy boy don't try
Police responds, never fast enough, the shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' wit son
'Fore we find out where ya bitch gets her hair and nails done
Its elementary, life is but a dream
You know row, row ya boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper, you take a life or ya life get took bitch
Sometimes, I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel

[Chorus - 50 Cent]
All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin'
I'm supposed to die tonight
niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay
I'm down to ride tonight
We crawlin, whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm down to ride tonight
We smokin', straight locin', locked and loaded
Somebody gon' die tonight

[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall, I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that keflon vest shit, that wild wild west shit
And eighty one 1 carrot stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make mothafuckas wanna kill me
Every projects and every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, had my mom been with me
You could bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin' on me will shorten your life span
Hold the mic with my left, the knife in my right hand

[Chorus - 50 Cent]
All through the hood, I keep hearin' niggas sayin'
I'm supposed to die tonight
niggas come put a hit out and they talkin' like the shit okay
I'm down to ride tonight
We crawlin, whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm down to ride tonight
We smokin', straight locin', locked and loaded
Somebody gon' die tonight


Well this week has really opened my eyes some. I have been having fun but it makes me look and see who is really there for you and who is there for you when they need you. Every ask yoursefl are my friends really my friends. Well can you answer these questions with a yes or no:

They call me usually on a regular basis to hang out?
They call me back when i call in a reasonable amount of time?
They usually never ho you out?
They usually keep in touch with you?

If you can answer these questions with a yes they are probably your friends if not maybe you should start questioning yourself. There are Aquantices and friends, friends are all yes to these questions and aquantices are mostly all no's. I sadly can't say all my friends passed this test. I don't know anymore i just don't care. Let me make my money, play my sport and after that i really don't care about school work and friends. If you don't show me you care i don't care.

""Sometimes, I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel""

John mooned all the girls which was hilarious. Than saturday i was baptised and my sins where washed away. An i saw it as a new start for me. So i vow to try to be more optimistic and i am not going to give up so easy on things or people. Maggie, Porter, and Cathryn came which made me happy. I don't know eveyone is talking about prom and i am just kind of hoping something happens and i find a date. Since many of you failed to do my survey i am going to post it again. Now GET ER DONE!

I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you
Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

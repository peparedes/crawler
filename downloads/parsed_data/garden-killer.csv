All I've been doing is attempting to unpack all of my shit in my room. For a while it seemed like it was exponentially growing throughout my room like a sea of boxes. But anyways, its gone now... sort of. I actually have a whole box of ""black dress shoes"" waiting to be unpacked. This makes me feel a little like a JAP (Jewish American Pricess for those who think I'm a racist).

Other than the massive unpacking I have been helping my parents alot. I went in and played with the 2nd graders in my mom's classroom for a few days and at nights I've been helping with the family coffee business weighing and packaging coffee. I've come to the realization that as an adult, I  now have more chores than I did when I was a kid. I now cook dinner for the family, serve it and then I do the dishes afterwards. I feel like the maid. Another JAPpy moment. I'm sure some of you do lots and lots of chores. I remember feeling very fortunate as a child that I didn't have many chores. It does feel kind of nice to have something to do with the business though because for so long it was just something my parents did without me since I don't drink coffee and have no desire to drink it. I think its repulsive. But this is something I can totally do.

For now I'm watching Cocktail on TBS. I fucking love this movie and I fucking love Tom Cruise. Though I should specify, I love young Tom Cruise the most because he's so adorable and sexy in a kind of naughty way. Id totally do him. Now he's a little strange and extra excited. He has aged well though, I just read his interview in DETAILS. No one can wear a drenched T-Shirt like Tom. I think his brain has gone a little scrambly though. Oh well.

Why is no one posting on their journals lately?

"event","I think that I am now ready to write you guys. I have finally recovered from the grueling packing and moving process. I packed for 2 days and then moved everything downstairs into my living room and waited for Thursday. Kevin and I then loaded everything into the UHaul and then unloaded it and then re-loaded it into the storage facility. The whole process took from 9am-5pm. It was endless. After that I drove down to Seattle for dinner with my bestest friend and then drove the rest of the way home to Portland. Of course my car was literally JAMMED full of shit. I'm talking there was not an inch in the car that didn't have stuff in it. I had all the seats down and stuff piled even in the passenger seat. I could see out of my left mirror and that was it. I felt like one of those dangerous woman drivers who can't see anything and just merge blindly. Not to mention the car felt like it had been lowered. Shockingly the fish survived their harrowing journey from Bellngham and have lived to see another day. The car however looks like shit. It needs to be vacuumed or something, it seems like there is dirt everywhere. I woke up on Friday after getting into Portland at 1230am and my legs were literally covered in bruises. I counted 31. I look like my boyfriend beat me up which could have completely happend because I have come to the realization that the moving process is like a fast-track to divorce. Nothing brings out the fighting like trying to carry a queensize mattress down narrow, winding stairs. I don't think Kevin and I have ever been so nasty at each other and at the same time so effective as a team. Though I believe that it was probably me who was nasty, I was a little aggrivated by moving and sometimes when I get frustrated I get nutty.

In other news... wait there is no other news.

I drove the UHaul all by myself! The little sucker was admittedly very difficult to drive. The whole time I kept drifting in and out of the road and lane and some guys in Ferndale (hickville) actually pointed and laughed at me. Whatever. I'm just excited that  I drove it.

I have to take some CPR/First Aid class which I hate. Obviously its for camp, they want to make sure if someone has a seizure that I know what to do. I dont know how much good this stuff does though since basically, its all about instincts when it comes down to it. I know that in case of an emergency I won't know how many thrusts and breathes I'm going to need. But I do know that ill know enough to dial 9-1-1 and get someone who does. I guess there is always that one person who really hangs onto that shit. I think those people become lifeguards.

So now I'm just lounging around the house getting yelled at by my parents who believe that I am still 10 years old. I think they don't realize that I live on my own all year long and manage to clean myself, wash my clothes, and make it out the door all by myself. I think that I'm pretty self-sufficient. I do stuff on my own and get stuff done that needs to be done. Maybe its just part of the growing up process.

It's getting late, I guess I will update soon."

"event","I just finished my final exams. You're the first one I told. Right now, at 1:09AM on Tuesday morning, I am finally done. I finished my two papers for my Queer Studies class and now I just need to hand them in tomorrow by noon. That shouldn't be too hard now should it? Two years down, 1 1/2 to go. Early graduation, bitches!

On other news, my boyfriend Kevin hit a deer Saturday night on the highway. Don't worry, he's fine. The deer didn't make it, sorry to all those animal lovers out there. Kevin's car doesn't look too pretty either. Though Kevin seems to be holding up fine as if nothing happend, I think that I have post-traumatic stress syndrome or something. I just keep seeing the accident over and over in my head whenever I close my eyes. I wasn't even there! WTF is that? Somebody please tell me how this can go away.

I guess I don't really have any other events going on in my life.

I'm starting to get a little sad about leaving the world and going to the woods to camp and then to England. I realized that these next few days that you talk to me on AIM or MSN are the last times we'll talk until I come home in January. How the world may have changed by then. I hope that the relationships I have with people don't change that much though because I feel really good about them. I finally feel like I have all my relationshps in order so that I have a support system. I'd hate to think I'd lose that just because of difference. I worry that my friends, even those I just chat with online about nothing, don't realize how much these little interactions mean to me. I hope that all of you will email me and let me know what's going on with you.

Awww. This is sad. 

Keep it real,
Robin"

"event","Hello Friday!

I'm so glad that it's Friday and I can do the Shabbat thing and feel like I'm doing something nice for myself. If only everybody took a day off from all the shit in their lives to  have a day of rest and relaxation, the world would probably be a better place. Even better, if our culture could let people take that day off. It's so unfortunate that we can't even let our lives stop for a measely 25 hours. What do we think is going to happen?

Side note: I think that I might have semi-webbed toes. I've always kind of considered it, but at this angle they really look like they might be webbed. Or at lesat a little too connected to be normal. 

I had the shittiest day. More like the shittiest experience. So today was going to be the most excellent day because I'm going to finally get contacts so that I can wear my aviators and be able to see clearly. So I drove 30minutes down to Burlington to see my eye doctor and when I got there the secretary told me that I didn't have an appointment. I freaked out because obviously I did have an appointment since I was there. And it was written in my day planner, which means I wrote it down. Where would I have gotten this from if I didn't have an appointment. So I was arguing with this woman and she was getting more and more bitchy at me and insisting that she didn't have me on the books. I was so frustrated; in my head I began to panic and wonder if I had forgotten something or if I had made this up. Sometimes I have trouble with keeping dates and times straight but since I've gotten the planner I haven't had so much trouble. Internally, though, I know I can't always trust my mind and my memory. For some reason though I KNEW I had an appointment so I kept pushing it. And then a security guard came over. In a moment of clarity I realized that if I didn't leave I was going to attack this woman or cry. So I decided to leave and write as I'm leaving I caught my Dr. Scholls sandal on the metal bar on the doorframe and slipped and fell on my back, knocking the wind out of myself. Then, and here's the brilliant part, the fucking door actually hit me. I let the fucking door hit me on my way out. That was it, I burst into humiliated tears and fled to my car and sped out of the parking lot. I was just so enraged for some reason, I can't remember being so ANGRY. I decided that it was probably unwise of me to get in my car and get back onto the freeway in my hostile state because I might freak out on the next guy who cut me off or something so I pulled into the parking lot at the outlet mall and shopped off some steam for two hours until I felt sufficiently soothed enough to operate large machinery. At least I got a really cute black halter top for my pain.

So that was it, I not only have a bruised ego but and bruised ass. How humiliating. And then Kevin laughed at it. Frankly I was a little surprised and concerned about how angry I felt. I don't usually have a temper, I find myself to be pretty easy going. Maybe it was just an isolated incident but I don't think I've ever felt so angry at one person in my whole life and it's not like she did anything too grievous. I'm almost fascinated by it. It's emotion that I'm so unfamiliar with indulging and experiencing at it's fullest.

Thankfully I came home and found my new L-Word DVD in my mailbox from Netflix. As much as I find this show to be really boring, I'm a little sucked in. I get very attatched to characters. I feel like that sometimes when I read a book. At the end of an incredible book where I really felt for the characters I'll feel so sad that they're gone. I want to know what happens next. I'm sure everyone feels like that a bit. I'm sort of looking forward to really reading again. I can't believe it's 10:00 already! What have I done with today?

I have another predicament: my fish. So in a fit of mothering instinct I decided I wanted to ""nurture"" something so I bought these fish who ultimatly died. But before they died one of them gave birth to a bunch of little guppies. The majority of THEM died as well except for these two who live pretty peacefully in my bright orange fish tank. Except sometime next week I have to drive all my shit down to Portland and assuming they live until next week, I suppose the fish have to go too right? I feel like they may not take the 5 hour trip to Portland very well. I also don't want my car to reek like fish tank forever because the water splashed around at 80mph. My dad's solution was ""can't you set them back into the wild into the river or something?"" Um, these fish came to life in my tank. I don't think they'd take too well to the real world. No, these are definitly domesticated fish who are used to the good life of premium fish flakes and plastic plants. Sending them into the wild would mean almost certain death which I just can't do in good conscience. You see, I have this little, weird, issue with death when it comes to my fish. The mother of my fish, the fish I originally bought at PetSmart, used to be a little aggressive and let's just say she had a little habit of eating all the other fish I brought into the tank for her. Everyone kept telling me that she was a ""bad"" fish and that I should flush her for the sake of the other fish. Kevin's theory is that she has already committed the crime of murder and it's simple justice. But when I looked into the little fish's eyes I could see that really she just didn't know how to communicate well with the other fish. And then she got pregnant and I couldn't very well kill a pregnant fish now could I? I don't know why but I just can't bring myself to the idea that I should play god like that and decide who should live and who should die. Some pro-choicer I am. 

This little dilema I have with killing the fish, while admittedly fucked up, has made me reevaluate my political and moral stances in the real world. I mean these poor little fish, they wouldn't even know what hit them. It probably wouldn't even hurt. I hate to simplify the issue, and I'm sure I'll get some sort of hateful letter about this, but I am starting to feel more and more like this when it comes to abortion. I have a hard time reconciling myself to the idea that a fetus isn't actually a person waiting to happen. Even my own faith stands behind the idea that a baby isn't a baby until it takes its first breath so I know I can't be going all religious. I don't ever feel like I could personally do that to a fetus, for the same reason I couldn't do it to the fish, because I don't feel like I have the right. But then, who am I to say that others shouldn't have the right? I guess that's why I'm still pro-choice and diligently using birth control. 

And don't even get me started on Terri Schiavo. 

I'm beginning to like more and more this LiveJournal thing. I don't feel like I'm writting to anyone in particular so I don't have to censor my thoughts for that specific person and at the same time I'm not really writing to anyone but myself. I guess it helps me clear my head and explain myself to myself. All this stuff that I don't think anyone would care about or want to discuss. At the beginning of these entries I always fill in some sort of mood but then by the end the mood is always sort of the same, ""content and relieved.""

Alone with my thoughts,
Robin"

"event","I got so much done today, I felt like I was some sort of machine. 

10:00 Geology Lab Final-- not as easy as I imagined, didn't do as well as I imagined

12:00 Went to the U-Haul place and reserved myself a U-Haul, they actually asked me to sit in the U-Haul truck just to make sure I was big enough to see over the steering wheel.Then the guy said the most ridiculous thing to me ""Well, you know, it drives just like any other truck like a Ford or Dodge or sumthin'."" Do I look like the kind of girl who drives a truck? No. So I told him I had never driven a truck and he looked like I'd just told I didn't have a driver's liscence. Him and his U-Haul buddies just giggled to themselves and then he said ""yeah, girls like you usually get their husbands to take care of this stuff."" Jokingly, I asked him what did he mean ""girls like me."" And he said, and I'm not making it up, ""you know, blonde... good-looking...little."" So apparently not only was I helpless and stereotypical, I'm a stereotype that needs a husband. Fuck husbands. I rented my fucking U-Haul and I inted to drive the thing all by myself. Even if my boyfriend is going to help me get the boxes inside it.

3:00 Had 2-hour board meeting with my new Co-Executive Director of Hillel, a member of the community board, and the Director of the Shalom Center (the interfaith center Hillel is in). I'm not sure why, but Hillel meetings are SO long. Everything about Hillel takes so long. Is it really awful that I'm relieved to leave for London so I won't have to do this anymore for a while? I AM very glad to be sharing the responsibilities with someone. Like AJ said, delegation is key. This is my new effort for this year.

5:00 Went to the gym and lifted for an hour and then walked on the treadmill for another hour. Two solid hours of ass shaping. Though I should say ab shaping because I got a little carried away with the sit ups and now I feel like I wont be able to digest food because my muscles are all tight and squeezed together. In some weird way, I've kind of embraced the pain and like it. I love that feeling of energy and accomplishment afterwards. Even though my inner thighs hurt so bad I don't think I'll be walking down the stairs anytime soon.

Well I guess I haven't been TOO productive compared to others but to me, it was impressive. Somwhere in between the U-Haul place and my meeting I kind of started a fight with Kevin. I feel bad about it now. It was about him not coming down to help me move when it was convenient for me. I guess its too complicated to explain here, probably too boring too. In hindsight, I think I'm just pissed that I'm dependent on my boyfriend to help me do something that I should be able to do myself. In reality, I really do need his help moving my stuff from my second floor room into the moving van and then into the storage locker. We are talking about a queensized bed here. I just want to be an individual and self-sufficient a little more. I want to be a woman who doesn't need a man around to help her do shit. I want to be a woman who WANTS a man to help. Even better, I want to be a woman who men WANT to help. Yeah, thats it. Kevin just didn't seem to want to do it with me. I can't really blame him, it's my house and I don't even want to do it but I just thought that maybe he'd want to feel like he could help out. I thought guys really liked to do manly stuff like that. Maybe it would be an ego boost, feeling like your girlfriend needs your big strong self for something. Whatever, with all this weight lifting I bet I'm strong hardcore enough to move my own self out. Husband shmusband.

Definitly looking forward to going home and sleeping in my own bed. Like one where my roomates aren't having sex constantly right down the hall. Seriously, all the time. It's like a one house brothel or something, you can always hear someone moaning from somewhere. And furthermore, they're always naked. I'm afraid to turn the corner in my own home in fear that I'll encounter naked people in sensitive positions. Not that I'm abject to those positions (see previous entry), I just don't want to know or see it. Yesterday in a Lunesta-induced stupor I tried to find my toothbrush and found my roomate and his boyfriend making out right outside my door. At least someone's getting laid all the time. In turn I'm just watching a lot of CNN to tune it out. Thank god for Ted Turner.

And the moaning continues,
Robin"

"event","<P>I'm so excited, I have 5 more days until the end of school. That feeling that I spoke of last year, that suffocation, I haven't really felt that as much. It more feels like a slow death to the end of this year. I'm in such and excellent mood! I took my new sleeping pill last night and practically fell into a coma until exactly 10 this morning when I woke up refreshed enought that I could have taken a run. But I didn't. Because I was late. Like always.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Today for the THIRD day in a row we've been talking about domestic abuse in my sociology class and its starting to make me feel really depressed. Before this was rape and then marital rape and then now the domestic abuse. Seriously, I don't know how much more of this I can take. I feel really guilty about feeling like that though because I know that it's a really big deal and that I should be really educated about it. I just can't think about this anymore. </P>
<P>Even more depressing, I'm reading this book called <U>Schoolgirls</U> which is about girls in middle school and how they learn these certain behaviors that essentially lead them to be really fucked up. One point that they're discussing at length is the idea of sex in middle school and how more and more of these kids are becoming sexually active and mostly in terms of oral sex. I can't even imagine being interested in that when I was 11. Can you? The thing thats most disturbing is that these are first hand interviews with these girls about the circumstances of this and how clearly they associate sex with being appreciated by men. At the same time they associate girls who have sex with being ""sluts."" How unfortunate that we send such a mixed message to girls about sex when they're so young. I dont even know the answer though. Maybe we're not informing kids <EM>enough</EM> about the actual emotional consequences that can come from sex. Maybe we need to include that in all the information we give them about condoms and AIDS. I'm starting to see why people think the sex-ed programs in this country aren't complete enough.</P>
<P>Hmmmm, for being in a really good mood, it seems that I have a lot to be contemplative about.</P>
<P>I have speant the past two days watching episodes of Showtime's ""The L-Word"" for my Queer Pop Culture class which is a show about the lives of lesbians. At some times, it's pretty hot to watch. For the majority of the time, its kind of boring. The plotlines are kind of slow and very....sensual. Sometimes I'd just like of like to watch them get it on. I can't believe I'm saying this in a public forum. It just seems so interesting, I'd kind of like to see how it's different. What I have noticed is the <EM>way </EM>in which sex is shown in this lesbian show is very different than the way sex is shown in heterosexual shows. There wasn't so much of a focus on the actual sex acts like there&nbsp; is in shows like ""Sex and the City,"" it was more focused on naked backs and legs and kissing and blah blah blah. Ok, it's still kind of boring. Maybe that's why it's not so successful of a TV show with the lesbian or heterosexual audience. There's just not enough pussy for any of us.</P>
<P>And with that, I will leave you.</P>"

"event","Good morning friends.

I realize it has been a long time, for that I deeply apologize. You see, instead of publicly displaying my emotions online I've just been festering. Fester fester fester, that has been me. But no longer, the fester is over. Besides, when I go to Europe in the fall I'll need this to communicate with you all so you can know all of the minutiae of my life. And I'll be gone all summer so I figured I should start now and alert the masses that I am going begin to tell you about my life again. 

It has been exactly a year since I last updated, ironic? Probably not, more like coincidence. Isn't that right English nazis?

So you'll notice it's like 3am on a Monday and I'm still awake. The answer to this is simple: I am an insomniac and terribly bored. On Friday my doctor FINALLY succumbed and prescibed me the ""good stuff"" so that I can fall asleep and possibly find myself refreshed at 8am the next morning. For now, I'm trying to lull myself to sleep with activity.

Do you know what has been bothering me? No one has honest good convorsations anymore. Everyone is so guarded and afraid. No one confides anymore, they just inform. I think it has to do with us as people,  maybe in this time of our lives. We're in our twenties and we're trying to convince ourselves we're invincible so we build up this shield around us so nothing can penetrate. When I least expect it though, I find myself within someone's shield. I had a convorsation with someone about 3 weeks ago like that. It felt so raw and real... I wish I could get that feeling all the time. We need to stop being so guarded, I feel like I'm the only one who is wide open. 

It's 330 and I suppose I should go to sleep and turn off CNN for the night. Instead I'll just lie awake, angry at myself for being awake. Or even worse, angry at myself for not being awake for my life. What the hell am I going to do with my life and why does everyone seem to know but me? Why do I look back on high school with such pleasent nostalgia and at the same time a feeling of lonliness and pain? Why do I even give a shit about that time in my life? I think it has to do with the fact that I feel like I can't remember a meaningful time in my life, a time when I was supposed to grow up and the fact that I don't remember the process of growing up makes me feel like I never did. Or that I'm unsure of how I got here. People don't completely understand because if you did you'd stop pitying my pathetic memories and give me more of them. I have albums and albums full of photos of my teenage years but I can't seem to remember when they were taken. And what of the memories that I don't have photos of? Those are the most scary to me. What if they disappear? What if I never truly remember? What will happen to that moment? Chew on that for me.

And with that, I leave you.

I have to write a few papers and then I'm getting the FUCK out of here. It's not that I don't love school. I do. I just can't stand being here any more. I must leave. I don't really think I'll miss it all that much either.

I feel like I'm swimming underwater and I can see the other end of the pool but I know that if I breathe at this point in the race, I'll drag a few extra seconds that might cost me the race so I keep holding my breath. But now I'm starting to get that pinch in my throat that says if I don't breath soon, I'll pass out. That's where I am in the year. If I don't breathe soon, I'm gonna pass out and die.

I'm obviousy in an analytical mood of some sort.

I am really excited to seen my friends. I haven't seen Jess since Thanksgiving where I saw her for a day. I just realized that a few days ago. I never think it's been that long because when I talk to her it feels like I'm there. I miss that little bitch. I was never really close to any friends from school but I've seen that change a lot this year. I think I might have strengthened some bonds with some old WHS friends and I'm looking forward to the summer where I might be able to cultivate that a little bit, even if I'll only be at home for a week. 

So that's my bit for the day, more to come I'm sure."

"event","So I know it's been a long time. I've been really stressed out latey. I speant the last weekend at BB Camp, my job this summer as Arts Director, sorting through massive amounts of art supplies. I found the most random stuff like 5 gallongs of acrylic paint thinner and one teensy weensy bottle of acrylic paint. It's really awsome being the first arts and crafts director to ever have this new space. I love to organize, I know it's nerdy but I don't care.

While I was at camp, the USY Regional Convention was this weekend in Vancouver. I wish I could have gone, I would have really liked that. This was the last generation of USYers that I really cared about. It made me really nostalgic of my old USY days. I even included a picture of me in this post of me as a USYer back in the day. This was at International Convention in the winter of 2001. It seems like it was so long ago, Kevin and I just met at this convention. He's in like everyone one of the pictures from this convention. How'd he get so popular?! USY was really one of the best times of my life. I don't think I could have been happier than I was when I was with all my friends. It's too bad that all of us haven't stuck together as much as we should have. I never even talk to Jay anymore... well I guess we didn't talk much when we were on board together either now did we? And I wonder how Helen did this year as MemKad? It's really nice that Kevin was in USY too, at least I have someone to reminisce with. Bar none, though, Jess is the best person to talk USY with because no matter what I did in USY... she was always there. My partner in crime. I think that's what your best friend SHOULD be afterall.

I just looked at the rest of the pictures from that convention and I realized that was the convention I hooked up with Max. What a cute kid he was. He's turned out to be a really good guy too, even if I didn't do anything but corrupt him. My roomate and I were listening to Garth Brooks today and came across the song ""That Summer"" and we were like, ""This is the grossest song... its about some guy getting with this older, more experienced woman! Who does that?!"" Damn. Me.

And on that note, I need to do real shit."

"event","I'm sitting on my bed, gorging on flax chips (like tortilla chips but without wheat flour) and thinking about how pathetic I am. Sad. So I decided to go tanning this week if I ever find the time. I feel like even though I'm taking less credits than last quarter, I have absolutly no time to do anything. Less than winter quarter! It shouldn't be like that at all. I got my QAF DVDs in the mail supposedly but they're holding them at the post office until I come to get them. No idea when I'll be able to do that, but whatever. At least they're in the US. Tomorrow I dont get out of class till 5, the post office is open till 5:30. My only window is to go between Jewish American Studies and History. Hopefully it doesn't take me that long to get the package. Whatever. Anyways."

"event","It's really late, but I thought I might update this a little bit. I'm at home in Portland. Portland always makes me reminisce a little bit, like I'm sure it does with everyone else. It makes me think of high school especially. What a waste. I feel like I should have gotten so much more accompllished in 4 years, and maybe I would have if I hadn't been so caught up in dealing with my own shit. Alas, thats the Catch 22 (never read that book btw) of high school. You have all the resources to get stuff done but you can't figure out how to do anything so you do nothing. When I think back on the luxuries of washing machines and a big refridgerator (don't even get my started on that fucking midget fridge of doom)and the cleaning lady who came every 2 weeks, I cringe a little. 

Another thing I regret is not having been friends with enough people. I've kind of decided that there must have been something wrong with me in high school, I was the person no one wanted to be friends with. I wonder why. I felt so depressed sometimes that I didn't have the energy to go out and meet new friends and people who showed interest in me usually go shut down just because I was afraid of the hurt. I should have introduced myself more...

I went through all of high school feeling so worthless when really there were people I could have been friends with all around me. Across the fucking street even! Maybe I should have talked to Sophie Johnson instead of being a little scared of her. She just seemed so free and artistic and worldly, I was afraid she would see all the wierd things about me. She always seemed like such an incredible free spirit.

I'm really lucky that I found Kevin when I did. I'd like to do a little ode to Kevin, I never talk about him like this anymore. Right when I met Kevin I had a revelation. That winter I'd gone on a convention and met this guy from Spokane who I liked and thought was cute and made me feel kinda nice. We hooked up a little but then he never really seemed intersted again. I felt so betrayed. It would be nice to blame it all on him, but really that was like the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back. I felt betrayed by ALL the guys I had hooked up with, gave a part of me to, or at least shared some connection with and whod broken my heart a little. Eventually it felt like I just had this huge broken heart because of all the chips these little incidences had caused me. 

And then I met Kevin, right when I felt the worst. I don't tell him enough that I love him. Or at least not sincerely. There's the obligatory ""I love you"" before good-night. It's not the same. I think love is something that is different for every couple and at different times. When Kevin and I first fell in love we had a loud, adoring kind of love because we were always in the spotlight of USY. Two  years later, we have a quiet kind of love. A love that grows on a sunday morning when the sunlight wakes you up, curled up naked next to each other in his bed when his parents are gone. It's the kind of love that is shown in the familiarity (but never the predictability)of the way it feels to hold hands. The kind of love that endures the LUSH soap store for a half an hour while I make him smell every soap in the store. Two years ago I never could have known to wish for it. I thank God that I got it anyways, even without asking."

"event","Having kind of a spacy day. I woke up at noon because I didn't want to go to my Jewish American Studies class. .That class can be so annoying because the rabbi who teaches it is such a dickhead. I probably shouldn't say that on the internet where he could read it. Oh well. Rabbi, if you're reading this, you're a dickhead.

Anyways, I went to my band class today and I was the only person from the first flutes there today, of 5 people. Of course that meant that we had to play all the pieces with solos in them. Presumably, if I was a good player, I would practice EVERYTHING just in case the two people in front of me got hit by a bus or something on the way to the concert. Since I'm not a good player, I don't practice at all. It was total and utter humiliation. I did however get a new permenent solo in this Gershwin peice from Porgy and Bess. The only thing is that it's really swingy and jazzy and anyone who knows me knows that I am neither swingy nor jazzy. I could use rythm help. Obviously I also need spelling help, but what can you do.

So it's Cinco de Mayo, I should probably be downing Corona's by now. A few of my music g eek friends are going to a composition concert down at the PAC at 8. I personally am going because there's a really attractive trumpet player playing in a brass nantet (I think thats how you say nine brass players). So what if he's only still in high school, no touchies anyways. He'll be nice entertainment through the bizarre 20th century music. God help me if Kevin is reading this. 

Kind of quirky mood. Hmmm. College girls are easy. Yes, yes they are."

I wish I could just look the other way when I see it on the stand. But I can't because it's too goddamn funny. With that said, I think I finally saw an article that's the tip of the ice berg for me. I finally found an article that is just SO awful, it's not funny... it's sad.

How pathetic is that? The worst one is the last one. Guys are real quick to sign their girlfriend up for a Brazilian bikini wax, they've never felt the pain. I'd like to see a guy get a bikini wax, he'd probably cry.

"event","This afternoon I skipped my sailing class because it was raining and I really don't feel like going and sailing in the rain. For sure I'll get some awful disease from that and die. In any case, instead of sailing I did all the stuff my parents have been nagging me to do like go to the scholarship office and financial aide office. 

Apparently my parents make too much money for me to get any money from the government and the scholarship I got this year isn't renewable. So basically I'm more fucked next year than I was this year. Essentially the only way I can get grants from the government are if I'm an independant. The only way I can be independant are if my parets are dead or I'm a veteran or I'm married. So basically I will be holding interviews for the position of ""husband"" shortly. Applicants inquire ASAP.

Ugh, today has been so BLAH. The only saving grace is that I'm leading a cooking class tonight at the Hillel. I miss cooking soooooooooo much. I'm so excited when I move into my apartment that I'll get to cook all the time. So I prepared a few recipes to do tonight. I'm teaching a French bistro inspired meal of Vichysoise (a creamy potatoe-leek soup), a baby-greens salad with raspberry balsamic vinagrette, and toasted pepper breadsticks. I used to look at people who were naturally good at things with such contempt because I didn't ever think I was naturally good at anything. That is, until I started cooking. Don't believe me? Come over for dinner. 

So I'm embattled with the hard reality of trying to write down my recipes. So hard since I dont usually think about that. Damn a key on my computer is coming up. Fucking computer piece of shit. Anyways, muse get on that since I only have an hour to do it in. Damn."

"event","So I dont know the rules to these things but I'm wondering if its tacky to update your livejournal twice in one day. Whatever, I don't so much care. 

Today I got my HIST 113 (Western Civ from 1700-present) midterm back. Can I just mention that I'm so fucking pissed that everyone is talking about their finals weeks and I'm just getting back my midterms that I took a week ago. 4 more fucking weeks. Yes, it is appropriate to use profanity when discussing the length of school I have left. Anyways, as I was saying, I got my midterm back and I got a 93%! It's actually the highest grade in the class... the class of 200. I called my mom up to tell her and she was really excited but do you know what she said to me?

Mom: ""Maybe when you got your brain illness and you had to relearn everything you relearned a whole new brain or something.""

Thanks mom. My dad was even worse...

Dad: ""Yeah good, so did you go to the financial aid office yet? How about the health center?""

Thanks dad.
 
In any case, I'm pretty proud of the midterm since I think that seals my spot on the Deans List for the third quarter in a row. I never used to be good at school at all in high school. I remember being really jealous and angry at the Adam Cohen's and Jennifer Stocks's and Alex Rodriguez's that all set the curve really high and did really well. I'm not sure what they're all doing now, I assume they're all doing admirably well like they always did, but now I feel an extra bit of pride knowing that if we ever met again I'd feel like I was on the same level as them. I always thought they were like gods of smartness. 

So while I've been at school I've picked up some good habits, like getting good grades and also having a social life at the same time. However, I'm very interested in these bad habits that I've picked up. 
1. DRINKING: Do you think its a requirement that you drink in college? I don't know, but I NEVER drank in high school. What can I say, my social life revolved around a Conservative Jewish youth group. Though I did smoke some pot at the end, it was only because my best friend was sleeping with a drug dealer from Wilson. Now that I'm in college I drink almost every weekend, maybe I should stop that.
2. HYGIENE: Let me preface this with saying that the washing machines at Western only take these cards and the cards only take $5 bills at a time, so I never have enough money to put in the machine even though I have the $1.25 to do the actual load. I don't know if that makes sense, I hope so. So I never wash my clothes anymore. I'll wear clothes until they either reek or are so dirty they can't be worn anymore on a good conscience. And speaking of clean, my room used to be clean. I vaccuumed yesterday for the first time in a month. I own a fucking vacuum, how hard could that be?
3. POP MUSIC: Maybe it's Kyle, my gay bestest friend (who I affectionatly call my Faggy Friend) and his love of Britney and Christina. Maybe it's Betty, my roomate, and all the goddamn Disney (I guess thats what I get for playing all my wierd Jewish dance music). Maybe I just dont have the energy for deep poetic music anymore but all I seem to listen to is mindless music. Damn. I need to get some taste back again.

I'm so sad, I just figured out I'm not going to be here for Kyle's junior clarinet recital. I really wanted to go, apparently he's really good. He practices all the time so he sure as hell should be by now. On a better note, I think I'm going to get to be the flower girl in a friend's wedding. You might be asking yourself, ""but aren't flower girls 5 year olds?"" Well you would be wrong. I'm a midget, the least I could do was volunteer to be flower girl.

Ahhh, alas finally the end of the day. Day 18 since I ordered Queer As Folk from Ebay, we'll see if it ever gets here. I want it by Friday, I'll tell you that much.

Nite nite."

"event","Right off the bat, I'd like to say that the title is misleading since I've done this before. Don't worry though, I'll be gentle with you ;-) Anyways, like I was saying, I had one of these when I was a freshman in high school. I don't think I wrote about anything important, however I'm sure at the time it was all very dramatic. Ah high school... whoever said it was the time of your life was a LIAR. College is where it's at, which is where I got my title. No longer a drama queen, I will try to write about intelligent and/or interesting things. Or maybe just whatever I'm doing. So what am I doing...?

Well, I just got back from Canada for my boyfriend Kevin's birthday. So we've been dating a little over 2 years and this is the 3rd birthday we've spent together and this is the only birthday that I think I really got right. Yes, I still waited until the day before to get him a gift, but this time I got him a GOOD gift. I bought him a back massager for his car and I took him on a tour and tasting of his favorite brewery. What I didn't anticipate was that they woud give me 4 whole glasses of beer and I'd have to drive home. Bummer.

I break to tell you my roomate, a chemistry major, is close to tears over a double compound. Fortunatly, I am blissfully ignorant as to what that is all about. Being a history major rules. 

Finally, dinner. Olive Garden, the home of all things suburban and bourgeousie, here I come.

Ciao for now."

Family screaming....I sit quietly trying to pretend i don't hear anything......razor blade just laying there....and i stare at it..... willing myself not to pick it up......but i pick it up anyways. I hate EVERYTHING."

"event","I told my boyriend about my cutting problem. He took it extremelly well. He just said ""it's no big deal"". And at first I thought he didn't care if I cut or not, but he explained in a letter that he does care. He's so sweet. I'm so glad I told him. Now if only he can find more time to spend with me.....^.^ He has wrestling every day after school. I'm trying to figure out if I can ever see him on the weekends. What do people do on weekends anyways? Go to the movies? I don't know....maybe my mom will let me go to his house to hang out for a while. Hmmmm....I'll have to do some begging. ^.^"

"event","I'm having trouble with my boyfriend. He doesn't know I cut and I'm trying to figure out how to tell him. I've known him since October 15, I started dating him November 16. So....I've been dating him for almost 2 weeks. He doesn't know a whole lot about my family life, but I've been filling him in. I havent cut since I started going out with him, until a few days ago. I slit my wrist and did a few other cuts on my arm. I'm tired of wearing long-sleeved shirts when I go to school. But I'm really tired of hiding all of this from him. He has no idea of what is going on. I want to tell him, but don't know how. HELP!"

"event","I'm so very bored today. I hate thanksgiving break. All I've done all week is sleep, play on the computer, eat, and sleep some more. Oh yeah, I've bled to. Nothing like slitting your wrist to start the boring weekend. My poor mom. She doesn't know what to do with me. She found me in the bathroom, right after I had cut. I was still bleeding everywhere and she just barged in. *Sigh* I'm so sick of living this way."

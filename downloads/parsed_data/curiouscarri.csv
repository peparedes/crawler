"event","hello out there. whats up everybody? tonight sucks. i just got back from a funeral. RIP Sigung-James Whitney. i love you like a father and i will never forget you. he was my Kung Fu instructor since i was 7. im glad i went tho becuz i saw all the people that used to go too the Kwoon(temple) with me. i saw alot of faces that i missed. all of these people decided to make another school in honor of him and of course i will be a part of it. this was a very hard night for me so if there is ever a time where you think you cant make it thru a death like this, you can. just try and remember all the good times you had with this person and never forget them. its very hard to let go but we all kno that they would just want you to be happy and they wouldnt want you to cry. so everybody just keep your chin up and be strong and dont take the love of others for granted becuz they wont be around forever. all of us that were there tonight were just over whelmed becuz he was just such a strong man and we never thought we would lose him, but we did. we kno in our hearts that he is smiling down on us gracing our presence, and being proud that those of us that showed up were strong and kept our heads up. ok im gonna end this now. I LOVE YOU JAMES A. Whitney RIP."

"event","Hello my friends. i didnt go to school today. i dont feel good. ya im pretty bored. me and michelle need to chill sometime. ya she's great. Last night was fun....i guess. i had to wash my step-dads truck. i love washing cars. i like to play in the hose. my best freind is grounded for a month. that sucks. she skipped a week of school and stayed at my house cuz her mom thought it was spring break. but her school called and she got busted after spring break went perfectly. at least she didnt get busted in the middle and ruin our plans. ok good bye to everybody!!! bye michelle!!"

"event","<P>Hey everyone, it's now Wednesday, at like 10:00 pm.&nbsp; I'm just trying to get logged on to my livejournal, but it only takes like 20 minutes, lol.&nbsp; Today in Creative Writing we did a little poem thing.&nbsp; Well, I'm gonna give everyone the opportunity to do the poem as well, soon enough anyway, since I have to write the code for it and everything, lol.&nbsp; It's a Mad Libs poem, so fun isn't it?&nbsp; Tehe...</P>
<P>If anyone wants to try it, let me know by commenting on this journal, or e-mailing me or somehow getting in touch with me.&nbsp; I love these little games, lol.&nbsp; I hope you will enjoy them too.&nbsp; I'll add the poem soon enough, but for now, I just want to talk about the day.&nbsp; It's been such a quiet day, aside from the ""tropical weather,"" lol.&nbsp; I'll be back to report about the day later, but until then.&nbsp; Lata.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~Jon-Erik~</P>"

Anyway, just testing out my journal to see how it's workin' out, and hopefully a get at least one comment in the first 3 weeks of this date, lol. Today is the 25th of February, 2004, and it's Monica's and my and my anniversary (8 months :-D) yay!!!!! I just finished typing up all of my creative writing entries for the final literary fair tomorrow, hell yes! It's all gravy. Yesterday, I continued my game, Metroid: Fusion aka Metroid 4, for gameboy advanced SP. It was great! I beat the game in a total of like 4 and a half hours. I don't know how I did it, but I did. Lol. Anyways, this is my journal. And I hope you all like it. Please comment on my entries. They are fun entries :). Tehe. ~JE~"

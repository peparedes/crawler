"event","i'm tired of this.
i'm tired of being away and this happening every minute of the hour.
you can't do whatever you want and expect me to fall back wearing a smile.
it doesn't work that way. if you want this to work you need to grow up.
if you expect me to want to talk to you, dont be immature and don't try to get me mad.
i know you dont like when i'm mad and i don't like to be mad.
you can't be mad at me for turning down an offer to go have fun with another guy.
if you want to keep me you need to realize what you have.
it shouldn't have to be this hard.
you can't let it be this hard.
today i'm tired of convincing you i miss you and i'm sitting home alone.
i don't like to sit around and do nothing but i'm doing this for you.
i won't fuck up.
so dont be a fuck up."

"event","I think i've definetly had like 8 livejournal accounts in my lifetime.
i always use them for like a week ocd and then i forget about it.
and then when i go back to use it, i either dont remember the name or the password. 
i need to start being consistent with everything. 
schools starting up and i need to do my homework. everynight.
and i need to do drivers ed. after i finally get my permit (a little overdue? maybe.)
i need to make an effort to keep in a semi-constant contact with my out of towner people. i always talk to them alot and then i dont for a while and then we talk again. i dont want to lose contact. i dont want to be one of those people who talks to them when its convenient. 
from now on, consistency is going to be a priority. it has to be.

it's so strange how a something can bring back memories of people who used to mean the world to you and who are now either non-existent or whose location is unknown. a simple picture can just make old conversations and promises pour out of the back of your head. it amazes me every time.

"event","It's only been 8 hours. i miss my crew.

this can be the cause of my insanity and the death of my sweet dreams.
sleeping won't do me good because i did all that in the car.
i want to go home but people suck and my mom wants to lock me in the dungeon.
dungeons are cold and dark and for black people.

i'm not black. and i'm not down with wet chilly basements.
so if you could just kill off my family and get the fucking bugs out of my house and off of my keyboard we could be friends someday soon."

so here is a temporary backround until one of our 'journal modification techinicians' (joey or jerry) gets a free second to <strong>FIX THIS SHIT.</strong>
ATTN TSLJ MEMBERS: this journal needs immediate attention or i fear the worst could happen."

"event","OH. okay.

lets clarify a few things:

jerry isnt the ringleader. there is no ringleader. theres only three people. and me and angela have been here since tslj was BORN you cant just take over tslj.

but angela just because you have like_breathing now doesnt mean you can just toss tslj to the side like an empty bottle of rash cream.

and nobody wants you out of tslj. i dont at least. so lets just forget this ever happened and next time we have a tslj chat i think we'd all appreciate it if you wouldnt abandon it.

oh and joey.... let me just quote you from a MONTH ago... "" [18 Feb 2003|03:09am] 
<strong>Its time to put some effort into this TSLJ.</strong> The name that is. The start of it all is <strong>now.</strong> Its an all on war. Everyone just wait for it, youre time is soon...""
joey, my question is- what happened to your love and dedication to tslj?"

Wafflebites: shes on the phone
Wafflebites: with JOEY probably
moonsxovermyhamy: what a sucker

well actually i was on the phone...but not with JOEY. i mean...jerry i knew you wanted to take over, but i never thought kristin would join forces with you. i mean, wasnt it you two who said:

Wafflebites: angela jerry just informed me that he is the RINGLEADER of tslj
Wafflebites: isnt that fascinating
moonsxovermyhamy: im the ringleader
moonsxovermyhamy: the leader of the pack

im disappointed...in the both of you."

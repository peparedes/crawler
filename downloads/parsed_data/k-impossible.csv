"event","A couple nights ago I watched a video of the Harvard commencement speech given by J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series. I wouldn't say that I'm a big Harry Potter fan, but I will admit that it was an amazing speech. One of my favorite quotes was: 


""Some failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case, you fail by default.""


After I read that quote, I minimized my screen only to see the desktop image on my laptop: a white background with simple cursive text stating ""failure is impossible.""

Finding irony in the situation, I realized that failure is both inevitable and impossible. We will never be the best at everything. Consequently, and unfortunately, I don't think we can always meet our own expectations. We cannot always be satisfied with ourselves, and in this sense, failure is inevitable. This point of view also uncovers the beauty in failure, because it forces us to imagine better and motivates us to work toward a goal, bettering ourselves.

This cycle of failure and progress defines us as people. How hard we work after failure, when we're not sure that we even believe in ourselves, sets us apart from our peers. We are defined by our ability to ""bounce back,"" so to speak. In this case, failure (as people) is impossible. We cannot fail through our misfortunes, but only learn."

"event","Ok, so I rarely post blogs. If I do, they're never a reflection of my true self: a convoluted maze of thought that dead-ends or perpetually aspires into a magnificently beautiful sense of enlightenment. This spiritual awakening through my journey to enlightenment is so much like the most complex maze that the mind could possibly conceive. We truck tirelessly through this maze, not knowing how long we will travel, or if our efforts will ever be returned in the form of an elusive conception of happiness and fulfillment. We truck tirelessly knowing that the reward in which is desire is solely to understand that the maze doesn't exist at all. The ground upon which I am present does not exist. The tears that I have cried through my frustration of the journey, they do not exist. My body, to which I am so materialistically attached, does not exist. It is merely a bridge, connecting my soul to my perception of the material world. All that exists is my journey through the maze and the universal knowledge that I obtain through my travels. Beautiful. Amazing. Divine perfection.

As we travel through this maze we hit dead-ends. We tire. We grow exhausted. We feel as though we can not possibly thrive until the end. It is in these moments where we find the absolute beauty in life. We sit in front of a brick wall that merely hinders our travels. It is in this moment that we realize that we are nothing. Or that we are everything, depending on how you chose to decipher it. Whichever way we chose to look at it, we realize that we are either the same amount of nothing, or the same amount of everything. We are all the same. We are transcendentally ""put in our place,"" so to speak. This is the moment of helplessness in which we realize that we know nothing, but spiritually have everything, more than we could ever ask for.

If what I am trying to say has no resonance with you, worry not; it's only a matter of time. Or perhaps my words are failing me. Established language does not remotely compare to the magnitude of spiritual thought, and therefore this thought cannot be explained, but merely described.

Selflessness. What an amazing, over-powering, and almost opaque concept. This is where my words will truly fail me. How beautiful the day that one can put his brother before himself. Or even recognize the man beside him as his brother at all. Such a simple sentence, yet the most complex of ideas. ""I am my sister, my sister is me, and we are Him."" After we realize that we are Him, we begin to understand the true magnitude of how deeply we have been blessed. We weep for the not yet knowledgeable, that they do not have this understanding of  spiritual fulfillment. A fulfillment that comes only by being materialistically completely empty. Irony. This is definitely a topic that cannot be explained."

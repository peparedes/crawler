"event","i hate life.  i hate you especially.  i think you are so fake.  i worry about you becuase i don't think you realize your faults and so you're going to end up in the same trouble and it makes me sad when i watch people in situations that will make them unhappy.  you worry too much.  you choose to make yourself as unattractive as possible (which is probably for the best).  i am always amused by you but worry about us being friends.  you are my favorite person in the world and i would do anything for you, eat onions, throw up, not wear a bra, poop in public, go to school naked, stick something in my eye, live without air conditioning. i hate when you write nm.  i hate eating food and feeling sick.  i hate being fat. i hate that you are better than me, even though i don't think you are and i think i am being judged unfairly.  i hate that i could have been everything you like about her but i wasted my time being with you.  i hate this.  i hate here.  i hate that this is happening.  i hate papers.  i hate deadlines.  i hate you.  i hate you a lot.  i hate gainesville.  i hate right now.  

i really want to shave my head because im angry and hurt and i dont want to be pretty and i want to tell myself that the reason im unliked is my hair, and i can comfort myself by telling myself over and over that you're being mean to me because you only liked my looks and i fucked them up.

oh, and i wish this all weren't happening.

and one of my tamagotchi's is ugly.

i hate that no matter what i do it all ends up the same.  i wish i could really believe this and stop killing myself for your sake when you're just going to ignore it?"

"event","should i shave my head again and claim to be a really big brittany spears fan?  

i mean, i did it already and everyone knows.  and i know i JUST got a nice haircut, but i could just get a reallyr eally really tacky wig.  like a pink one or something.

plus, i cut my hair so that when it grew out things would be better than they're probably worse.  plus, i want people to like me for my boobs and my wit, not my hair.  hair is soooo shallow.  

and um, it looks real bad and i like it."

"event","stop lying to yourself/the rest of the world.  grow the balls to admit what you think.  we're all mean.  we all know that.  tell someone that they're unattractive, don't try to convince them you're not their type.  if someone tells you you like them, don't say aww how cute, say 'you don't have a chance'.  if you don't want to hang out with someone, don't make excuses, just be like bitch you suck.  get over yourselves everyone.  really.  please.  i'm so sick of everyone ever and their fucking mildness.  

i'd almost prefer the shit talkers because everyone is shit, and maybe we should be talking about that.

i love how i know i'll spend my night doing nothing and then regretting it later."

someone tell my why i shoudl stay in gainesville.

someone tell me why i can't just be happy with brooke, and caitlin, and dylan, and marli.  why i can't let myself be friends with people and be happy.  why do you have to ruin it all and make me feel guilty all the time and make me wish i was someone else that i don't think is as good as me?

all i wanted was a clean apartment, to be skinny and have everyone like me, and have a girlfriend.  why is that so difficult."

"event","it doesn't matter what i do.  because no matter how hard i try it all goes back to every regret i've ever had and no matter how long i go, you'll still expect today and you'll never believe otherwise.

everything before today doesn't matter, all that matters is today and i'll hear about today forever, and things will never be okay, in this town, in this city, in this state, in this country, in this lifetime.

i tried so hard and i can't be more than myself, and i'm just not a good person.  deep down i try to escape myself but i can't.  i'm done trying to escape, i can't.  i just wish i could get away from this.  

i'm not supposed to exist and my whole life has been a reflection of that.  

and all i can think right now is that i'm so semantically challenged because there are no words to express how hopeless and pointless and worthless i am.

can't someone just come and take my life?  all the parts they'd want and leave the rest with me so i could feel like nothing was wasted.  all the moments with richard can go to some lucky girl, and any other random spec of goodness can go to random friends, and i can be left with right now and all the bad parts of my whole life and if by chance a moment of goodness occurs i can give it to someone who really deserves it.

and right now all i can think of is -- why can't you like me? whats wrong with me? im fairly pretty and i know im smart and witty and i know im sad now, but im okay around you and i could be okay and i just dont understand why you -- you specifically can't like me.  what's wrong with me.  why am i not good enough, and how could i ever be?"

"event","i hate that i couldn't do anything.  that im basically not allowed to miss or care about you for fear of causing drama.  i hate that i met you.  i did nothing but take away from the shortest most unfair life ever, and if it weren't for me, so any things would be different.  if i had just stayed away from you, richard would have never gotten in any trouble with his parents and maybe he could have been somewhere better now.  he could be happy, and with someone far better than me.  i wish i had just not gotten in trouble and never gone to richard's movie night.  i wish i never took anything away from you, from richard, from everything you guys had. 

i wish you guys could have led happy catholic lives and i could lead my happy super liberal one, and i wouldn't feel like i ruined so much.  i know i effected something, and im so sorry for that i guess.

i wish i could be somewhere else and had never met any of you and didn't have to feel like i caused so much damage when all i wanted was to be friends with you and spend the rest of my life with richard.

and i just want to go back to high school because at least then i had this dream that things would get so much better, instead of the reality that everything is completely fucked up and the future will only get harder."

"event","i worry that i'll never love anyone as much as i love the feeling you get when youre all singing the same song in the car and you love the people you're singing it with and its late at night but you're not tired yet and the song makes you think of when you were a kid and it was exciting to be in a car without your parents.
or certain foods when you're really hungry, or foods you havent eaten in a long time and really wanted, or breaking in shoes, or getting packages, or taking polariods, or getting lots of messages or when youre favorite teacher stops in the middle of class to ask you about the motivation of your hair cut.
i had a lot of moments today and yesterday where it wasn't about a 'relationship' with a person, but instead either this small t quirk of friendship or things going smoothly or pants fitting or finding socks.

and i feel like maybe the world wasn't built to save me, and i was just built to save it, and maybe i was never meant to mix with someone else the way i see other people and the way they do in movies.

i want to volunteer at the CMC.  meet beautiful activist straight women.

maybe it's time to properly embrase my introversion and save my extroverted moments when i was really meant to be social.

i remember looking at you and thinking how beautiful you are and how much it hurt that i finally recognized that i thought more of you than i'd ever thought of anyone and i've never wanted someone as much as that moment and i worry that i'll never really want anyone again like that."

but alas i do not.

i do have a lot of boxes, $250 worth of food, 254 kitchen appliances i had never heard of, a couch, the sniffles, cable, quarters, and an extra entertainment system.

im actually really excited about unpacking/eating/not being bothered by worring about whether you are home or not and if you are coming home and what you are doing and if i even cross your mind anymore.  

i love you : ashley, ashley's pastor david, arielle, alex, leah, phil, marli, richard, for either helping me move or visiting me while i was moving and offering stuff and being amazing and awesome.  i owe all you guys food with my crazy kitchen appliances.

am glad that i saw it, but wow.  im actually watching a screen that says exit music, and that makes me not know what to think.

i just hate that part of history so much.  find it so not worth making a movie of.  and its only worthwhile when it's more offensive, and then only minimally."

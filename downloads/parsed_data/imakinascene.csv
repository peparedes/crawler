"event","<p>So the days are numbered and my fathers wedding approaches. I try to be happy for him, but sometimes I just get so angry. How dare he marry that woman.&nbsp;<br /><br />I know momma's hurting. Not because she loves him, but because karma hasn't come for him yet. He just got a big deal promotion while we can barely afford to get our cars fixed.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have to stop tormenting myself, but I really don't know how I'm gonna handle this wedding. It's supposed to be a joyous occasion yet it feels so....morbid.&nbsp;<br /><br />Kind of ironic my dress is black. </p>"

"event","I thought I was starting to settle into a groove in Barnesville and maybe tough it out through the&nbsp;next year(s), but then I realize no. This place, these people are just too diifficult. Is everyone in society this difficult or is it just the whiny ass bitches at Gordon? I miss home. I miss church. I miss my old grooves. I miss the dirty couch. I miss &quot;scandalous&quot; being lesbian leg holds in drama. I miss my nemesis being Stone and the norm...not the group of people I voluntarily surrounded myself with. It'll be nice to leave Gordon, Barnesville and never look back.&nbsp;Thia is a&nbsp;time I &nbsp;just want to forget. I love&nbsp;Sarah Beth and Kristen and I suppose this time down here was just Gods way of showing me how truly blessed&nbsp;I am to have such amazing, amazing friends who would never treat me the way these so-called friends treat me. They are the real things. The true girls who have my back. I am forever greatful to have them in my life. I doubt I could go on without them."

"event","So this morning was simply horrible. I learned that some very very dear people in my life would be leaving shorting. Including Charity and Judah. So I was very melancholy all day long. And on top of this I still held all the feelings that I talked about in my previous post. You may imagine now how tragic I was.

So I went over to Toni and Carls to hang out, but they just wanted to watch TV. We all know how much I love that...:/

When I got back to my dorm I had a message from John. I called him back and he asked me why I was so sad sounding so I told him about Jay and Dawn moving to Texas and Father David Jones and Pat going to Louisianna. He tried to cheer me up by saying maybe its better for them and I should be happy if they are happy with the decision. *groan* After that he said well put on a happy face and let's go drive around. (he got a new car)

He ended up taking me to High Falls State Park and we played on the rocks and rapids, I'd like to add my pedicure stayed perfectly in tact.

It was really nice. And he really cheered me up.&nbsp; Maybe I'll keep him. :)"

We all played poker(I didn't know what was going on). Then we played checkers with shot glasses(of course I drank the ""bitch beer"" cause I didn't wanna get fucked up). Anyway one thing led to another and we started kissing. I have to say it was nice, but I felt really skanky. He told me he liked me, I thought it was the alcohol talking, but his friends all said he liked me and he took Sarah aside and was like ""I like your friend"". So now comes the part where I turn tail and run because now I'm all freaked out. I've sobered up and I just wanna like run to the other side of the world."

One was a solid blue Dumbo that smelled like blueberries; the other a yellow(gold) Lady(from lady and the tramp) that smelled like citrus. It was so exciting (cause blue and gold are thespian colors). So Sarah suggested we buy them for each other as Thespian Pres and Vice Pres gifts for one another. Then we went to Best buy so I could get the Imogen Heap cd and I saw that they had the Office Space soundtrack, which Sarah has been singing a song from for the past....forever. So I bought it for her as a ""Christmas"" present lol.

One of them we...Sarah, had met two years ago at one act competition. I was there too, but that was one of my awkward years where I was scared of everyone and just wanted to hide behind my hair.

So I went to Chili's last night to eat some chicks with Sarah Beth. We were soo pissed because of a certain person(who I'll not mention for arguements sake). But then the waitor cheered us up AND we ran into Whitney Ray. I love her. So we made friends with the waitor then he sat and talked with us it was funny. Then Whitney and her beau came and ate with us for a while. I swear the alcohol off her breath was getting me tipsey(very pleasing)lol. Then the waitor gave us a free dinner. 

OH! and during Maureen's proposal in Rent Katie proposed to me!! LOL it was hilarious so I guess we're married by common-law now. She is however having an affair with like 6 other people including some marines in Iraq. ;/ but of course I have my mistress as well.

Dr. Love thinks a relationship might work out between Maureen Johnson and Joanne Jefferson, but the chance is very small. A successful relationship is possible, but you both have to work on it. Do not sit back and think that it will all work out fine, because it might not be working out the way you wanted it to. Spend as much time with each other as possible. Again, the chance of this relationship working out is very small, so even when you do work hard on it, it still might not work out.""

"event","Today began simply awful. I awoke thinking it was gonna be a fun day with the kids and my best friend and because of the rain it all went to shit. I moped around for a few hours feeling like i had just ben shat on. I decided to get on my instant messanger and see who was on; my dear ""sister"" Jana was on and we talked for a while then I went to take a bath and shave my legs. Well she calls me right in the middle so naturally I answer and tell her what's up. We have a good laugh about her timing and talk (while I shave my legs). She tells me the horrible news about one of our Christ the King members and practically the backbone of our church. Her father had died suddenly the night before, no warning no nothing. One of the healthiest guys you could meet. Then her husband got in a car accident this morning. THANK GOD he was alright. I would have been devastated if anything happened to him(and no doubt poor Mrs. Donna). So after Jana had told me all this I suddenly felt guilty. My day had been dampered by the rain and yet I bitched and moaned about how my life sucked. And yet during those very hours and wonderfully sweet woman lost her Father and could have lost her husband...and she's hanging in there. It really put me into perspective. Spiritually I've been trying to get closer to God, it's my goal to reach as far as I can spiritually with him as I can. This was just another one of those life lessons that help you out. Unfortunately it hurt someone in the process.

Convocation is this week(June 1st,2nd, and 3rd). Bishop Halloway is doing the sermons and he was talking about how God is a jealous God, but not in the way we think of. In a loving way. He loves us so much and what's to be with us so much that he'll remove those obstacles in our lives that prevent us from being with him. My Father was one of those obstacles. I'm starting to really understand alot I didn't before.

After the service tonight most of the folks from the percentage of folks who came to CTK for convocation all met up at Stake and Shake for dinner. I was invited through Deacon Tony(another dear friend) he and his sweet wife are life family to me. I simply adore them. Anyway Tony offered to take me up there since I had no other ride. And God bless him he even bought my dinner. Well me and Father David got into a discussion about being Slain in the Spirit. I had told him I was having trouble believing alot of the Charismatic happenings hat had gone on to night(due to some unfortunate events occuring earlier in my life with a dreadful pastor). Now I trust and believe Father 
David more than I trust my own family, so when he tells me something I will believe. He has never in all my 17 years of life given me a reason to distrust him. He's one of the few men in my life who have backstabbed me. So I knew I could confide into him my issues. He helped me clear them up and then we joked around. His tapped me up on the head mimmicking what a father/canon/bishop/deacon(not sure which) had done to him when he was slain to give an example of the pressure(to prove it was real ya know) anyway my natural reaction was to pop back and I did. Took him by suprise. So the entire evening we had a little competition going. And when people asked we just replied ""We're trying to see who goes down first"" in reference to being slain. Some may see it as sacreligious, but thier uptight needle butts. So screw 'em!!! lol j/k!!

Anway, i had a wonderful day and I can't wait for tomorrow's sermon and hopefully after party. 

Peace, Love and God Bless"

"event","I personally don't believe in soulmates(I use to). One thing I believe is that one of the main causes of divorce is the belief in soulmates. Many people divorce because things get hard and they don't want that so they assume they weren't 'meant' to be together. They weren't soulmates and they should go there seperate ways so they can find their true partner. I think that's bull. I think there are various people who are more suited for each other. To steal from someone elses quote. I believe you fall in love, you commit to a relationship and you work hard at your relationship. Some days you work harder than others at it. After all why would the marriage vow say ""For better or for worse, till death do us part"" if marriage was expected to last a few years and be a happy lala land?"

"event","ELEMENTARY BIBLE SCHOOL TESTS

PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE WORDING AND SPELLING.
IF YOU KNOW THE BIBLE EVEN A LITTLE, YOU'LL FIND THIS HILARIOUS!

IT COMES FROM A CATHOLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEST KIDS WERE ASKED QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS. THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE BIBLE
WERE WRITTEN BY CHILDREN. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN RETOUCHED NOR CORRECTED.

INCORRECT SPELLING HAS BEEN LEFT IN.


1. IN THE FIRST BOOK OF THE BIBLE, GUINESSIS. GOD GOT TIRED OF
CREATING THE WORLD SO HE TOOK THE SABBATH OFF.

2. ADAM AND EVE WERE CREATED FROM AN APPLE TREE. NOAH'S WIFE
WAS JOAN OF ARK. NOAH BUILT AND ARK AND THE ANIMALS CAME
ON IN PEARS.

3. LOTS WIFE WAS A PILLAR OF SALT DURING THE DAY, BUT A BALL OF
FIRE DURING THE NIGHT.

4. THE JEWS WERE A PROUD PEOPLE AND THROUGHOUT HISTORY THEY
HAD TROUBLE WITH UNSYMPATHETIC GENITALS.

5. SAMPSON WAS A STRONGMAN WHO LET HIMSELF BE LED ASTRAY BY
A JEZEBEL LIKE DELILAH.

6. SAMSON SLAYED THE PHILISTINES WITH THE AXE OF THE APOSTLES.

7. MOSES LED THE JEWS TO THE RED SEA WHERE THEY MADE
UNLEAVENED BREAD WHICH IS BREAD WITHOUT ANY INGREDIENTS.

8. THE EGYPTIANS WERE ALL DROWNED IN THE DESSERT.
AFTERWARDS, MOSES WENT UP TO MOUNT CYANIDE TO GET THE TEN
COMMANDMENTS.

9. THE FIRST COMMANDMENTS WAS WHEN EVE TOLD ADAM TO EAT THE
APPLE.

10. THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT IS THOU SHALT NOT ADMIT
ADULT ERY.

11. MOSES DIED BEFORE HE EVER REACHED CANADA. THEN JOSHUA LED
THE HEBREWS IN THE BATTLE OF GERITOL.

12. THE GREATEST MIRICLE IN THE BIBLE IS WHEN JOSHUA TOLD HIS
SON TO STAND STILL AND HE OBEYED HIM.

13. DAVID WAS A HEBREW KING WHO WAS SKILLED AT PLAYING THE
LIAR. HE FOUGHT THE FINKELSTEINS, A RACE OF PEOPLE WHO LIVED
IN BIBLICAL TIMES.

14. SOLOMON, ONE OF DAVIDS SONS, HAD 300 WIVES AND 700
PORCUPINES.

15. WHEN MARY HEARD SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF JESUS, SHE SANG THE
MAGNA CARTA.

16. WHEN THE THREE WISE GUYS FROM THE EAST SIDE ARRIVED THEY
FOUND JESUS IN THE MANAGER.

17. JESUS WAS BORN BECAUSE MARY HAD AN IMMACULATE
CONTRAPTION.

18. ST. JOHN THE BLACKSMITH DUMPED WATER ON HIS HEAD.

19. JESUS ENUNCIATED THE GOLDEN RULE, WHICH SAYS TO DO UNTO
OTHERS BEFORE THEY DO ONE TO YOU. HE ALSO EXPLAINED A MAN
DOTH NOT LIVE BY SWEAT ALONE.

20. IT WAS A MIRICLE WHEN JESUS ROSE FROM THE DEAD AND
MANAGED TO GET THE TOMBSTONE OFF THE ENTRANCE.

21. THE PEOPLE WHO FOLLOWED THE LORD WERE CALLED THE 12
DECIBELS.

22. THE EPISTELS WERE THE WIVES OF THE APOSTLES.

23. ONE OF THE OPPOSSUMS WAS ST. MATTHEW WHO WAS ALSO A
TAXIMAN.

24. ST. PAUL CAVORTED TO CHRISTIANITY, HE PREACHED HOLY
ACRIMONY WHICH IS ANOTHER NAME FOR MARRAIGE.

25. CHRISTIANS HAVE ONLY ONE SPOUSE. THIS IS CALLED MONOTONY."

You give directions starting with, ""Go down Peachtree"" and include the phrase, ""When you see the Waffle House.""

You only know their way to work and their way home. 

You only drink Coke or Diet Coke - drinking Pepsi is blasphemy.

You know to wear sneakers to the airport.

The 8:00 AM rush hour is from 6:30 to 10:30 AM. The 5:00 PM rush hour is from 3:00 to 7:30 PM. Friday's rush hour starts Thursday afternoon, and lasts through 2:00 AM Saturday.

You use ""Sir"" and ""Ma'am"" if there's a remote possibility that person you're talking to is least 30 minutes older than you are.

You can Ponce De Leon Avenue correctly.

The falling of one rain drop causes all drivers to immediately forget all traffic rules.

If a single snowflake falls, the city is paralyzed for three days, and it's on all the channels as a news flash every 15 minutes for a month. All the grocery stores will be sold out of milk, bread, bottled water, toilet paper, and beer. 

If there is a remote chance of snow, and if it does snow, people will be on the corner selling ""I survived the blizzard"" tee-shirts, not to mention the fact that all schools will close at the slightest possible chance of snow.

If you are standing on a corner and a MARTA Bus stops, you're expected to get on and go somewhere.

Construction on Peachtree Street is a way of life and a permanent form of entertainment, especially when a water line is tapped and Atlanta's version of Old Faithful erupts.

Construction crews are not doing their jobs properly unless they close down all major streets during rush hour.

You never go 55 on ""The Watermelon 500 or the Georgia 400.

You know you're not allergic to pollen, because if you were - you'd be dead already.

You've never gone around the block and ended up on the street you started on.

You know where 'Butthead' and 'F*ckhead' are, and it's the same part of town.

ou haven't been downtown at night in years

You've woken up at 4:30 am on workdays to beat the traffic to work, intending to leave work before 3 pm to compensate.

You know at least five different ways to get to work, none of them ideal

You know what ""sunshine slowdown"", ""auto-flambe'"", ""topside"" mean, and what color a H.E.R.O. is.

You know where PIB, JCB, FIB, MLK, PDK and ""Grady curve"" are, and you try to never go there during any of the nine hours of rush ""hour""

You've thought about getting a blow-up companion for the front passenger seat

You hope you are the one to spot the vehicle that is the subject of the latest ""Amber Alert"" which has been flashing for ten minutes on the DOT message board exactly 13.5 feet above the hood of your SUV

You've been in traffic on 85, 75, 20 or 400 (choose one)  - wondering if your fuel, your cell-phone battery and your bladder will make it to the next exit, just 1/2 mile ahead

It's 4:30 pm Sunday, you're stone-cold sober and you've just finished the last left-over hot dog when you realize that in exactly 12 hours you have to get up and go to work - again

You actually get these jokes and pass them on to other friends from Atlanta.

I put a blanket over her and Ryan, another little boy I sit for, came over and asked why my belly was so big. I said it's not my belly it;s Peyton. He didn't believe me till I showed him it was so funny."

"event","I had the most amazing weekend evver! The only thing that could have made it better would be Matt Hardy and/or Amy Dumas making a random guest appearance. 

I'm a Thespian...I do it on stage(wanna watch?) lol

Anyway Friday and Saturday was the Georgia Thespian Conference; picture it hundreds maybe thousands of highly dramatic higherschoolers all in the same building. It was the most amazing thing I'd seen since last years Thespian Conference...only this year was even better.

I made lots of friends and ran into others from last year and other drama things. I have some awesome pictures I'll share when Sarah Beth gives me copies.

Note: I dunno what it is about thousands of theatre kids coming together, but everyone is so friendly. You just randomly go up to someone and start talkin the next minute your like best friends. I was walking to one of the workshops and a group of guys were going to the same class so I asked if I could walk with them. One bore a striking resemblance to Cuba Gooding Jr. Anyway I hung with them for a few hours. Another dude just made a comment about a balloon creation I was making and we hung out the entire day along with a numerous amount of people including one girl I met last year that I was excited to see again.

Mama Yeye's dance classes were sooo much fun. I had to come home and soak with incense, candles, and bath salts just to get back to normal from that vigorous workout. lol. Mama Yeye is soo nice too, we ended all the workshops singing a song that I cannot spell, but if you heard it you'd know it.

The 3D class wasn't so much 3D as it was absolutely fan-effing-tastic. BABIES!! Picture it, strobe lights, black lights, weird painted sheets, many many baby dolls...and umbrellas. Throw it together with the man inside my head and you've got the greatest workshop ever.

Physical Comedy and this Mime class was done, by the same teacher who is awesome. I learned how to make a balloon tomahawk and tie a rope not with one hand. I remembered the teacher from last year, when I took his physical comedy class. He's very funny and entertaining to watch. Also very talented.

Anyways I'll have pics later. THESPIANS RULE!!!"

"event","Hmm...something really out of the ordinary happened to me today. A boy, that's right a boy...and not some creepy stalker type if you're wondering, asked me, yes me not some of girl named Jaye...to prom.

I was a bit stunned at first and just kinda nodded my head and then regaining my realization of the fact that this was real and no this wasn't some sick practical joke I said yes. 

I don't think I like the guy, but we've been friends for a few years so that's cool. I don't think I can like another guy until I get over...well we're not going to get into that. I personally don't wanna like a guy. I just wanna escape adolesence without hurt. 

It's enevitable that I'll eventually have to deal with it...so why not push it off till later. Right? Right!? 

Of course right."

"event","So...Xmas break is over and I reenter the halls of McIntrash tomorrow. I wake at 6 or 7. I rush around getting ready. I get my schedule. I go to class. I sit around listening to a teacher drone on. I receive my grades. I fail. I go home. and all along I'm apathetic.

It's sad that the stress of school has made an empathetic, sympathetic, sensitive girl grow cold and apathetic about anything the involved school. That it makes a girl just wanna run away from everything and fuck herself over. 

And I guess maybe it's not just school I loathe...maybe it's many parts of my life in general. I've got it pretty good I think. I'm not poor, I'm not starving, my father and mother love me dearly...but I dunno...I just find myself miserable sometimes."

"event","OMG! Beau especially you listen up!

I was digging through my closet and I came across my Noose! The Noose! The Noose of Life. I was super pissed that Stoner fucked it up and so it sat in my closet for months on end waiting to be fixed, but I was too afraid to tamper with it. I didn't wanna ruin it anymore. So last night I found it and was like ya know what, I'm gonna fix my noose and then cherish it. SO I FIXED IT! AAAH! I actually fixed something I was soooooooooo happy. My momma's gonna by some hooks and my uncle is going to help me hang it in my room(but he don't know that yet HA!)

Random Fact: El cousin...neice...whatever the fuck she is to me *cousin/neice/thing slaps me* j/k we've decided on cousin. Anyway she's learning all about my life right now. WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

Anyway back to Noose of Life. I'm happy lalalalalalalal

Random Fact: Best Site ever: www.happytreefriends.com

Yeah that's it WEEE

Thanks again Beau for El Noose of Life"

"event","Maybe this Christmas will be different...maybe I'll get what I secretly desire most. Probably not, but no harm in hoping right? I feel so ridiculous...so lame...so pathetic...Sometimes it's really hard with mixed emotions about him. I don't want to like him 'cause I know he has no feelings other than maybe friendship towards me. I want to move on and get over him...maybe lust after another. All my life I've been attracted to the celebrities and it wasn't difficult in knowing I'd never have them...it was obvious. I know I'll never have him, but he's so close so...near my level that my subconscious keeps me chasing. I've tried different things to maybe catch his eye...even this lame ass book about how to ""Get his Attention and keep it"" Psht! Didn't work and I waisted like 6 dollars. I've come to the conclusion I'm just not a datable person. I mean i look around me and yeah i see girls not dating, but it isn't because they can't it's because they don't want to. The only offer I've received is from some creepy, horny nerd. If that's any look into my future I'd rather someone go ahead and shoot me. Ya know this is the first guy I've ever been heartbroken over...the other guys it was just like 'meh who cares'.Before him I didn't ever think I'd ever even want to date. I was too tough to submit to the traditional role of the girlfriend where it's always 'OMG me and Johnny went to the movies and he asked me to where his pin'. Now I'd love to be able to say that...well maybe not the johnny part or the pin...but you get what I mean. And it sickens me! I mean honestly WHAT IS THE DEAL with these retarded-easy-bake-oven-fantasies?"

There's just one thing I need
I don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true...
All I want for Christmas
Is you...

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you...
You baby

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You...

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need -
won't you please bring my baby to me...

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is
You..."

"event","Kris- Everytime I see you I see nothing, but a beautiful girl who won't let go of her childhood innocence. You such a kind and caring person. You have an elegance about you that I just don't see anymore. I think that makes you just so beautiful. In a world full of loose morals and cold hearts you stick to your beliefs and don't settle for the norm. You're going to go so far, whether it be that you're a historical traveler or a stay at home mom you're going to make a difference in so many lives. You've already affected me positively. Thanks love.

Sarah- I don't know that many people out there who are like me in the energetic department, but I'm so glad I found you. Suddenly I don't feel so isolated. You're alotta fun(By the way the moms at my church said you did a great job saturday). I love taking G-rides with you we always seem to do something totally stupid. No one else seems to have the same sense of humor as you do...it's amazing when I hang out with you I can be entertained by a branch. You've really helped me to just let loose and be stupid without feeling selfconscious. 

Bryan and Louis- You've made me realize that maybe there are good boys out there who do care. When my Dad left I was broken hearted. I didn't trust men very much before, but after that I became angry with them. I felt that the male gender couldn't be trusted. The way you treat Kris, Louis has made me rethink that, and Bryan the way you've always been such a gentleman to me and Katie and just everyone it gives me hope that maybe it's not a dying thing. Maybe there are some moralistic guys left out there. I can only hope.

Danni- You're crazy, but I love you anyway. You have you're own world and you're own opinions and I respect that(maybe not the kid thing, but that's okay)You're a super wonderful friend and always amusing to talk to. I know you're going to be whatever it is you wish to be. You're stong and unrelenting to you're beliefs. Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something.

Allison- We've had our ups and downs and I'm glad we're on an up. I miss our time we use to spend together when we'd right our fics and argue over who was hotter(Matt or Jeff lol). I still have that keychain you gave me. I remember when we'd go down to the creek and catch Saly's; you, me, and Vanessa. Or when we'd have those parties in your basement and play on the treadmill. I miss hanging out (and watching you fall off the trampoline). Be Happy Ally, I hate to see you so sad. You know if you need me I'm only a phone call away.

Beau- You're insane. I really use to hate you, but seriously you've grown on me. And even when you piss me off I can generally shake it off. I wish you the bestest in Nola or wherever ya goes. Don't forget all us Starbuck lovin, golf cart ridin, ghetto fabulous, Peachtree City kids. And always remember, Shut-up Butthole!"

"event","Well it all really started Thursday night after our heinous performance of Sorry, Wrong Number. I had this positively cruel headache that wouldn't cease. I was exhausted from lack of sleep and stressed to the point of tears(had been in tears all week). I could feel Flu season's icey cold hands slipping around my neck and woke up friday morning feeling simply dreadful. I beseeched my mother to permit me to stay home so that I would be in adequet condention to babysit that night. So sick, tired, and emotionally unstable I stayed home friday to clean my room, do my laundry(which had been piling up all month) and try to unwind my nerves. I felt a little better by the time I went to babysit and had about ten kids(luckily I had a partner). When it was over I went home and couldn't sleep so I dillied on the computer till 1 am before I finally decided to go to bed. I didn't fall asleep till almost 2 and I had to wake at 7:45 to babysit for 6 hours. SARS was with me and made my job alot easier(she's alot more energetic than the girl the previous night). We had 14 this time and one with a fever(101.7). He's usually one of the most active and you could see how bad he felt in his lethargia.(I saw him again Sunday and he seemed to be alot better) Well by the end of the six hours I felt so sick I didn't think I was going to make it to the play that night. I was sore all over, my throat felt raw, my head pounded like a thousand drums, I coudn't breath through my nose and man was a ever tired. Mom gave me som Tylonel and Zantac and Patrick picked me up at 5:30 and we headed to Crabapple. The performance in general was better than Thursday, but my energy was dead--six feet under--though after the performance my energy seemed to have picked up and we all went out to dinner(Thank you oh loving Rapson parents). The me and Patrick went to SARS' to start writing the script to Spazical!: Spaz! the Musical. It's going to be the most random masterpiece ever written! so I went home at 12:45 and slept soundly(ish). I got a call at God-Knows-O-clock in the morning from Katie asking me if I wanted to get some revenge. I open my mouth to speak and this rock some how found it's way into my throat. I was tired, hurting, and began to sorta cry. I can't remember what I said, but I think it was something along the lines of 'What the F is going on--OW!--I am hurting--F off! I'm tired!' and I think she got offended so I went back to sleep. I rewoke at 9 to get ready for church and we went. It was nice, church is always my high of the week. I came home played on the computer and watched Celebrities baddest moments. I realized I was bored so I went to Wal*Mart bought some hairdye and dyed my hair red, while I watched I love the 90's(97 and 98). Once I was finished with my hair the moment I had been waiting for all weekend finally arrive: History Channels 'Witch Hunt' came on at 8 o'clock. It was amazing! Totally made my day. It's monday night and I'm feeling...okay. It was a rough weekend, but that Witch Hunt was the perfect way to end and so I leave you with this.

Silence

A dreary evil silence
The loudest noise of all
Vengeful rappy, hateful tapping
Like the clanking chain and ball

I'm drifting into madness
I hear a whispered sigh
Stop teasing me oh Spiteful One
Unless you bid me to cry

Now he mocks me, can't you hear?
Laughing, laughing, laughing
Stop it! I cry: Refrain! Refrain!
I'm gasping, gasping, gasping

Silence...such an evil foe
He returns to torture taunt
To him I'm nothing, but a toy
Just a toy is all he wants

Have mercy heathen silence
Have mercy on my mind
And if you won't, I'll slip away
And ne'er will anyone find"

And of course I had to play poke-the-desk.Then I counted the ceiling tiles and drew a pretty picture. Finally Ms Stone sent some work(had that done in about five minutes). I gargled my saliva and watched the nice people come to deliver work for the other students. I was really hungry and I had planned to eat my snack, but another kid got yelled at for eating food...so I ate paper instead. Not very fulfilling. Welp only two more days..."

"event","It's so very difficult talking about sex. It's a topic that 'decent' people are suppose to pretend dosn't exist. All though my family isn't the bible thumping types, I was still taught to keep such things private. So I was far older than I should have been when I finally figured out sex and all the related things to it. Even though I pretend to be a blushing innocent, I'm far from it. Being far too curious for my own good and a very healthy sex drive kept from actually being that way.

I'd still be mostly in the dark if it wasn't for the 'net. All though actually learning anything was hard, since for every decent page out there, there are five billion mindless porn sites. So I decided to throw in my two cents. This journal will cover my person experiences past and present. I am happy to discuss anything here, but I will make this very clear right now:

<STRONG>I am not looking for cyber sex. I won't even respond to such requests.</STRONG>

Anyone is welcome to friend me, but if you don't have a age statement in your journal profile, I will require one posted here before I will friend you back."

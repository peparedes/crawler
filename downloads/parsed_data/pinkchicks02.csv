"event","Yes i know i made the decision to break up with zach hes an awesome guy , he just is to busy for me and as all you should know i love alot of attention.  Its not his fault no one should ever blame the other in the relationship.  Things just didnt work out.  And you know how guilty you feel after a break up? Yeah it sucks cause you feel like you have crushed someone elses life. My school also kinda was neglected which sucked. It just wasnt somting i just thought one morning when i woke up. I thought it long and hard. Anyway this happened like 4 hours ago lol well then i went to my schools game we kicked ass like no tommorow(oops sry randy) ha ha. (ace) That was alot of fun saw some old friends and saw some enemies...err. Oh well thier loss. Then how cool are me n nat we went to a bowling alley after...... It wa like cosmic so it had like music and lights and stuff.Which some pretty cute guys were next to us and so we kinda exchanged a few  smiles and stuff. Kindergarden stuff lol.I have always been so flirtatious even when i was like 2. We talked and bowled for a little then we left it was fun.  Me n nat probably have the most fun doing the lamest things ever.Whatever were 14 (almost 15 yay)were allowed to be immature.  My birthdays soon im taking some friend to universal which will be cool.Im so excited. I hope me n zach still stay friends , it sucks i always have to be the one breaking up with boyfriends and i always end up feeling like im the bad person , which i cant conrtol it well anyway im going to watch some quality Dr.Phil --i offically love tivo.( nat you should too) inf act everyone should.Im reading the great book that is liek aguide to reading mens mind which is pretty accurate.Its called  ""hes just not that into you""   so you will know if hes turely into you or just messing around.What else can i say.IM getting better i have had a cold n other problams but im in the clear now lol. yay! Me n my firends are going to he pumpkin patch tommorow then nats game on sunday to keep me busy and distract me.  Yeah i am so excited.  My friends are glad to have me back so all my attention goes to then now until someone else comes along.Wont be for awhile tho , im taking some time for myself.  I dont see how my cousin and her boyfriend stay so happy and there going on like a year and hlaf good for them they make me proud to be thier cousin(soon to be cousin in law) lol anyway i really better go my moms awake pace love and lammas.

"event","hey guys i know i havent written in a little while..Nothings really up just kinda been busy with school and homework and stuff.  For the weekend i did a few things i helped out at a special ed dance for kids that are ""special"" it was alot of fun cause the ppl there could care less what everyone thought of them and it just made them so happy to know that they have friends to talk too.  They are just so greatful to not have ppl judging them everywhere they go.My friends nat and heather came with me and we got all dressed up which was fun as well.Then at the dance this girl had a seizure and that scared me to death so now i just count  my blessings just that much more because i dont have to go threw all the things that poor girl has to go threw.  Everday is a blessing.  Then i went up to oxnard and saw my baby doll.Yesterday was our big week anniversery , lol its not that big but its nice to know someones thing of you that much more. We spent most of saturday on the beach and just enjoying eachothers company , went to a seafood fesitival (yucky) it was fun tho just to walk around. Then sunday Shawn and his girlfriend heather aka a good friend of mine came up and zach me christine shawn and heather all went to a flea market and looked around at some intresting stuff.Then we went to downtown ventura and walked around looked in a few stores then sat under a tree  and soaked up the sun until my mom called us and told us to start driving home. We dropped zach off at home and we left for home.That was my weekend , i miss my little sweetheart already.

Happy Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipper.


peace out my loves.

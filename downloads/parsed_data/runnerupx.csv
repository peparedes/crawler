"event","It's thursday and I stayed home from school because i stayed up way past my bed time last night. Weak.. eh? Well Valentines day is coming up on Saturday, and I hope everyones happy, especially all you good people who deserve it. I don't think anyone should be sad, but sometimes you can't help that. I want to write down as much as my feelings as possible without making someone uncomfortable.. so here goes.. Last night I just got out of a 6 month relationship. It was really tough and I am really confused about everything. I guess it wasn't meant to be and in the long run things will work out for the better, i hope. Part of me is so happy that me and her are still friends, but the other part of me just cringes inside of me and is like ""seth what the fuck are you doing, this girl is yours man, shes perfect for you."" I would rather be hurt than have her unhappy being with me. So my heart goes out to her and wishes her the best. Shes a great girl and I dont want anyone to think she isnt, because she is truely a wonderful person. Well thats all i can think of right now. I hope everyone has a good day. <3


PS.

And you were the outline
of everything you would become.
The keeper of these hands.
To hold you now
it is a far cry more than anything that I deserve.

I'm waiting to give you whatever the world may bring
I'd give you my life
cause I don't own anything.
It seemed like the bottom was all that I had until now
I'd give you my life
if you'd give me yours somehow."

"event","I thought everything was back to normal again but it was really just a false alarm. I am really confused right now about everything in my life. I'm growing up and I'm going to have to start making some big decisions. That scares me, but its life, everyone has to go through it. runnerup is playing a show on Sunday at the forest grove firehall, you should all come out to it, its gonna be good time, it starts at 12:30. Its getting pretty late...

""ill wait untill tomorrow maybe youll feel better then maybe well be better then, so whats another day when i cant bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you, this mood of yours is temporary, it seems worth the wait to see your smile again."""

"event","i honestly dont know where to start... i believe that last night my dreams came true. I am not just saying that either. The love of my life is back in my life and everything is on the right track again. I was really lost without her as you could see in my last couple posts. I just feel so complete again, its truley amazing. I love her with all my heart. I just want to let everyone out there  know.. dont let go of anyone that you truely love. It will be one of the worst mistakes of your lives. I just want to keep this one short and sweet.... until next time."

"event","For all of this... I'm better off without you. I wish i could say this, and i wish it could be true but thats not the case. I just want to say thanks to everyone that has replied to my last entry. It really means alot to me. More than you will probably know. Anyway.. I ran into ""her"" at the mall the other day when I was working. It was really awkward, I didn't know what to do but it worked out well. We exchanged our hug's and i miss you's. I called her the last few days, and we have talked a bit. I don't really know where we stand in our relationship and that hurts me. For all i know she could be out with another guy as i sit here alone or on the other hand she could be thinking of me and how she misses me. Time will tell all."

"event","I'm new at this thing. It's a little past 1:00 and I didn't go to school today. I didn't really feel to well. Well actually I haven't been feeling to great in a long time. I'm not looking forward to anything anymore. I have to work tonite and I am actually looking forward to that. I guess it takes my mind off of somethings. Has anyone out there lost a best friend? Someone that was so close to you that you didn't know what to do with yourself? I can't really explain how i feel, i wish i could  because then i would understand my situation a little better. I guess Time heals everything. I went to Club laga last night to see Story of the Year, and Letter kills and i was just crushed with a million memories of that one person that i was with for over 5 months. When you spend so much time with one person, and lose them, its just rough... a bad rough. I haven't talked to this person since sunday and it feels like its been forever. This is so messed up."

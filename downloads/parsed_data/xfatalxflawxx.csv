"event","so this weekend was very fun... the end of spring break tho... that kinda suck that i have to go back tomorrow. 

Friday:
so what happen was that we ::which was hannah chelsea jesse martin and i:: got to Dick and Karen's we got there before ian and family. so we just chilled... then when they got there ian had brought his friend shaun ::who was pretty cool:: so we went out side played a couple games of SPUD :: which was changed to SPUDSO for jesse:: we eat pizza and we crashed for the night after trying to teach shaun how to play mao

Saturday:
woke up kinda early eat breakfast than went out to play some more SPUDSO than played Truth or Dare ::which soon just became Dare... the funny thing is that i was wearing my D.A.R.E. shirt hehehe:: any ways which involved a lot of feet licking and eating things than for some reason we decide 
to go for a walk in these woods, and we were going to make a fort in there but chelsea was freaking out because all of the bug ::there were bug i've never seen before in there:: so we walked along the railroad tracks then on to this road that lead to another road that lead back to the house. we got a lot of honks and some lady offered us a ride and we were like no!so when we got back we thought we were going to go swimming and the guys ::martin and shaun:: started to get every thing together and asked karen but forgot to ask my dad so he got mad 'cause he heard from karen that we were going to go swimming... then we got in an argument i cried and in the end we didn't/couldn't go...

Sunday:
we had the regular breakfast ::which was kinda gross:: then we go ready for the day and got a big game of kickball going including the some of grownups but it went wrong with martin being athletic and crashing ito charlie trying to get the ball and sue getting way over protective storming off and martin feeling really bad... me and chelsea went to comfort him and than we had a all you can eat somore (sp?) extravaganza we played one last game of SPUDSO
and we went home!

THIS WAS MY VERY EXCELLENT WEEKEND!!"

"event","wow it has been a long time... nothing  is really going on i have been babysitting this adorable little girl maddie (i know i used to hate her but i dont see her every single day so it is different) any ways i have babysat her for the last two saturdays and im going to again thursday and saturday... a great way of earning money!!!

oh and on the ginny plateau it is getting to be like hell! i guess it is too early for them to be so... i dont know lovey dovey and i kinda feel bad because it feels like i am the only one that feel that way (except for kayla who is taking it hard to because my mom was like her mom!)... but also there are other factors... like her always putting in her two cents

so i guess that is all i cant wait for tomorrow im going to play the SIMS 2 and hopefully it is going to be better and my male wont be blind as a bat!"

so after that we went to go watch a movie... (Life as a House) and died because of the sexiness of Hayden Christensen(sp) and than kinda went to bed but more like chelsea keeping us awake with her blabering!and we were sleeping on a twin bed so we had to switch so our feet were hanging off the end (4 girls does not work... Me chelsea kayla and kaity!) so then we thought chelsea had to go early so i went down stair to wait with her and her mom didnt actually come, but asked my dad to take her home.
so the rest of the dad we just chilled and we are dog sitting hurley my friends dog and he is howling... he is a beagle

so this (or last) weekend was pretty fun... the first night was just us (here it goes... Ian, Frank/Kory, Alex, Chelsea, Jesse, Martin, Hannah and MUAH!!) and we just sat and talked... we also watched the Borne Identity... which was all good! but then we had to go to bed at 1 a.m. because our curfew which stink but we didnt really follow... 
then on saturday we mostly chilled when we were supposed to be cleaning and then the party came and all the ""young adults"" stayed upstairs and out side in the 20 degree weather! here is were it get interesting... i was standing out side waiting for chelsea because she said she would come out and when she didnt i went inside... about 2 or 3 minute after i came in alex or ivan (i cant remember who) run in the and said ian got hit in the head by a two by four.... and man did he have a hugh bump... he got hit by a 6 year old trying to protect his older sister
sunday morning we had our usual huge brunch and then went home on the way me ivan and chelsea took some pictures and jesse kept doing ""silly"" thing to get us to take picture of him...

So that was Part 2!

"event","ok... so I'm getting kind of mad at hannah right now... I think she is faking sick (and it is not out of jealousy because she get out of school)... here how it goes; soo she came down stairs and was like ""dad do i feel hot?"" and he was like ""omg yeah"" then he took her temperature and it was only 97.8.... also me and Kaitlyn have always had that theory because she would be like all ""sick"" in the morning and than hyper in when I come home... I'm feeling the same thing as she is and I have had it for longer!!!
second reason I'm mad at hannah.... so she had this play (romeo and juliet) and she was Friar Lawrence ((sp?)) and my dad took it ALL serious and invite everyone and mad this big deal of it... but the point of this little story is that I have done soo many plays and dad just pretty much comes in watches it and say good job in a voice like he doesn't want to be there like he was just there to pick me up... also I did romeo and juliet in 6th grade and he probably doesn't even know it or how many plays i have done (which is 5) times like these I wish my mom was here I was her favorite!

now on to maddie (who is this 2 year old that my dad does day care for) ... I did not realize what a little ice queen she is.... that might be a little mean but it is true! she was eating this string cheese and I got fruit loops and she was like let me have one and i was like not until you finish your string cheese and she was like DAVID FINISH MY CHEESE!!! and he did and he gave her the fruit loop how poo is that!!!! oh and I was trying to put on her shoe and she was wiggling and I do not feel good so I was like  maddie hold still! and she started to cry in to my dad and he looked at me like why did you do that... I hate this...

the goof thing is that I am hopefully going to go see Harry Potter finally!!!! I cant wait, I have been waiting for this for sooo long!!! AYA!"

"event","So, this is my first entry! yay! uhh yeah... 
Sunday I went to this eight year olds birthday party (which is kinda sad... not gonna lie) but he had a reptile man there and it was pretty cool. We got there late and we missed the aligator (shucks) but we got to see cool, really big snakes and lizards but then he called me up and told me to stick out my hands and close my eyes I was really scared and then he put a tarantula on my head OMG! I kept freaking out and then he put it on my hands and I couldn't look at it but then it was over. But the rest of the party was cool cuz I got to kiss an aligator and hold a really chunky frog. 
the end. 
hahaha and I'm done."

"event","This is the basic story line to FF7, there is also another debuger for a game shark. So check out this site I found.

The Story 
You start the game off as Cloud, a mercenary who is doing a job for, and with, the rebel group Avalanche. 
After you finish your first mission the plot of the game becomes more clear, the goal is to stop Shinra from destroying the planet with their expanding industrial influence. It becomes apparent that the story does not stop there. As it progresses you learn of Sephiroth and Jevnova, two powerful beings that wish to destroy the planet to reach the ultimate power. 
Recieving the help of six other characters, and two secret characters, Cloud must stop Sephiroth and Shinra at any cost to save the planet, and in doing so, help himself realize just who and what he is.

-----
Thats the basic story from that site. I don't want to write up myself cause well....its really a long story and one that might be mistranslated."

"event","From what I heard just know, there might be a flash back of Aerith being laid to rest. There is some girl in a cloud in one picture on the new teaser. I am not sure what that will unfold but there might be something about Yuffie, Tifa or Aerith. It scared me for a while wondering if they were going to make a second one. But now that the movie is coming out I thought they picked the right path for the series. 

Now they need to remodel it, make it clear. 

So now I am going to inclose some stuff.

"event","...I'm tired....i'm so tired....of being a storyteller...and of being a lousy friend

i've come to the conclusion... i'm a jackasshole! because i'm a control Freak in the rpg world...even though i have no intent to be one....

The Reasons be because ....@_@ whenever i was involved in a group rpg...i was looked at as the storyteller or starter...hardly once ever got to follow...  always headstrong about the plot...and not enough on Character Development...ignoring... *sigh*

I've been going through this all day...and i feel like i've been bad-- well who am i kidding...Read what i call myself...and you can hit on me for calling myself that.  my only regret is that i didn't have the balls to call myself...or even talk this out...

><...i can't go any further..because i hit a roadblock in a brain...and i wasted the day thinking this negativity trying to formulate it on this site...when all i really wanted was to say this to the Very important ppl in my life...my ...i couldn't even do my crafts thing today...because of this haunting my brain...okay maybe some think this no big deal...but when i feel i wronged someone...i can't stop thinking till i've right the wrong...   hate me if you think i'm bitching over nothing...hate me if i being too senitive.....i don't care...i just don't F**king care...b ecause Many OCs i really liked..i will never see again..and i have myself to blame...


  I only rp because it was the only time i felt free...i could connect with others...and i could let Creativity flow...but i got carried away...and Look where i am now..."

"event","At this moment after my first post...i have to get this off my chest...Am i burden..?   i feel like i am all the times...because i attack myself for making mistakes...no matter what the size....  and the fear of failing...  I have a love/hate relationship with myself...  i ask myself to go a day without fouling this up...sounds easy....not in this life.. there are times i am optimistic...and times i feel weak inside...but i usually mask it..because i don't want to rouse worry...but somehow, someway...they know...  They know

  Whenever i shurk ((however you pronounce)) my choirs from time to time..i get a look..and i feel guilty..because i didn't live up to my responsibilities.  or even when i do manage to do it...i feel bittered...giving bad blood when i shouldn't...  

back to mistakes. whenever something breaks...i do the wrong thing by accident or i forget to do a task when asked...i punish myself by belittling my self worth...up to the point i can't be trusted to do anything.

 In College work, i bitch to myself whenever work comes out crap..or is not up to par....but that's just life in general.., i couldn't even balance being a full time student and a part time job..because the classes required more of my time.

here is the skinny...i'm afraid of being trouble to anyone around me...and i can't help but try to set things right when i shouldn't stress...i can live with being not perfect..but i can;t live with myself that i did wrong..or hurt someone in any way...So i go through life trying to helpful...carrying this weight of the world on me...been doing this since Community college... If i get crushed by this weight..it's shame on me...but i won't drag anyone i care about into messes or my self pity...even though in the end i have to come to terms with matters that i do help with...be it family or friends, or God...or love.. or all of the above.

I thank them...but i still ask..why would anyone put up with someone who has hardly any love for himself...and can be consumed with negativity just by one bad thing.....  do i even deserve to be cared about..even if at the moment i'm thinking myself a Jackass of all trades?.. i try to let go of what bad happens; even most of everyone says don't stress it...but mental reminders...or a relapse of the thing..returns to haunt me... i feel there's little escape...and i feel i'm gonna do something i'll regret

Then say once you've hit the bottom...there's no where else to go but up.  i give some good advice to others from time to time...even help.....so why don't i help myself or practice what i preach...?  I have to know....Am i Burden? Would everyone be better off without me?  Worse?  .....?"

"event","Have you ever had a moment you try to do something right and it comes out wrong?  Well that's happened...again><.   I try to do something...and i blow it...because i'm a damned control freak...i jump the gun...and i have this unconscious pulse to save lives..in rpg wise..   Again...i ruin an idea...  i really tried not to wreck it...my g/f Neko had an idea for a Code Lyoko rpg...again somehow i blew it by trying to play hero...-_-  ...this WAS her char...And HER Char's history  Dammit!  


What Drives me...to do this ...?  Because i become what i hated.....   a hog..  before i met my love..i was in rps...where i've seen certain players try to take control of the story..with their chars being unfair to the other rpers....doing things such as attacking the enemy..and being a one person fighter...not letting anyone else get their two cents.   It was a crapshoot...and various rpers, who were also my friends...weren't gonna take it.  so we tried to do rping without them...and yes..even evade them...but they found a way to keep getting in...>< ...Aim, Yahoo, MSN...you name it..they've broke the code...So i make sure i don't be like them...

And now..here i am ..  Right up in theirs...  because i say the wrong thing at the wrong time..and it f**ks the idea up....and i find out this too late.   and i end up self bashing myself and whining.    What i've done is done....i can't change that....I have to remember...the limelight is for everyone...even neko (ari)....and waiting should've been good as well.   What i really should've done is a) control what i was doing.. B) possibly NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK about the Char history.  C) Look before leaping.


What good is rping if i'm just in it for attention or Recognition...?  To anyone that reads this...and is a fellow role player....don't make my mistake...   Be aware of the people around you...you can still have a good time..without being the center of attention"

"event","Have you never had a moment...you felt you made choices that through you in over your head..  i feel like i have...that is why i'm writing out what i'm feeling now...T_T...because i feel like crying.  when i first started my new semester...i had 18 credits...and i was hoping i would be able to manage them myself.....but when one of the classes required more attention...i was forced to drop that class....it was an art class...and was the only thing non computer related, and i liked it...however...i had to plan ahead in order to stay on campus...and not get kicked out...so..i went and withdrew...but..that wasn't the only thing i was forced to drop....because of my time trying to salvage art...i neglected my queuing course..((that involves math and computer science..)  so i had to drop that@_@...

Another thing in my mind is...whether or not my heart for a group rpg..still beats within me...  at the time i came back to college...i went back to the group life...to rediscover some things....everything was going smoothe...until posting came at a fast pace...and because my college life came first...i feel like i've neglected to look after went fast pace...and even i wasn't able to keep up...but i tried...and i even tried to help others into the rpg...one being Neko-ari-chan (My beloved)...and others like Julie and Dale...  i thought i was attempting to help by trying to slow the pace....however...what i was trying seemed more harm than good...  So right now....i'm taking  a hiatus of the group...until i feel i sorted myself out..because part of is to blame...for everything

I know everyone tells me NOT to beat myself up...but that's what happens when i feel i did wrong...i feel i gotta fix it or things will just get worse...and then i stress myself all over again..or worse...whichever comes first...   That's why i owe it to myself...my friends, family...and even my love...to stop doing the blame game...because unless i do...i'll always be ruled by self blame."

Her Differences..  it's the very things she does that makes me happy to be with her.  Even if others don't see her the way i do...then they really don't SEE Arianne.  because i see someone who is beautiful inside and out.  who shines bright in my eyes.  
Who i would choose over and over again^_^.

To My one and Only...Arianne-sama  **blows a kiss to her**   I love you.. always and forever

"event","Humm well today pretty much sucked..I cleaned my room for like 2 freaken hours. But oh well at least now ppl can come over and it will be hella clean..Like cathy she comes over and I have to throw everything in the damn closet. (because clothes are JUST for clothes) <--- huh fcathy! Jerms called me while I was cleaning and said he was gonna stop by WHICH HE NEVER DID! Humm anyways, this weekend me, fCathy, Jerms and Marcus are suposed to go to the movies AGAIN! We went last weekend but I was being a tease and I didnt do anything with fcathy. She was getting pretty pissed about it..in fact I think she is going to hold it against me 4-life. Oh well I'll have to make it up to her some how ;)! But geez, I couldnt do anything in kali's (my friend from -SLO-) car. It just felt weird, plus kali was in the car with us it would have made her feel uncomfortable and I wouldnt wanna do that to kali.:(!! But I think the funniest part of the whole night was listening to kali talk ""drunk"" the whole way back home, and watching her ""rock out"" to her ""TNT"" song by AC-DC! But hopefully this weekend it will be better huh fcathy!! Well that is IF i dont go out to glamis...which might happen because I didnt go last weekend! I'm sure my dad wants to go out this weekend! Oh man and for Valentine's Day it's going to suck because my dad is makeing me go out to glamis so now Me and Miss. fCathy arent going to beable to spend it together :(!!.... ~*Ash*~"

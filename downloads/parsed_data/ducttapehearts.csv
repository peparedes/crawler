"event","Dear Robert,

you shouldn't be concerned. i can handle my own life. im not jelous of you by far, because your letting yourself go. you write such pretty words, but life's no story book. Love's an excuse to get hurt and to hurt. im not ready to be in love again. but im happy you've finally moved on. i am no longer in love either. i dont like the person you've become, and i dont like how you treat others when your around alicia. you are not the person i had been in love with. 'do death do us part' and i think you died when you started taking those pills, and i died when i left you. but coming alive again isnt has hard of a task. some times its hard to breathe without you holding my hand, but i can just grab someone else's and breathe just as well. pretty much this is a RIP (rest in peices) because nothing can be solved and nothing can be forgotten.

'hit it and quit it' well thats happened with me and all the relationships i've ever had except one. have i learned? FINALLY. i know. im so dumb. was at wendy's last night, she is such a great person. she told me alot, and really helped me think things through. a really great pick-me up. ive been extremely depressed lately though. for no reason at all, its crazy. ive been going through a ton of stress lately, rochelle is no more. she is a crazy bitch and i want nothing to do with her if she can forget a friendship that has been going on for 6 years in one week. Shawn has been talking to me alot lately =) which makes me smile. i'd really like to get to know him. school has sucked. honors chem. phys. is soooo hard. and so is honors english. my 2 hardest classes are after lunch, how dumb is that. i never pay attention in the afternoons. but luckily my classes are to boring, my day goes by pretty fast. tomarrow we get out at 11:15!!!!! im so excited, im going to beg stefano to take me with him to shanna's tomarrow. now off to do homework. =("

will you come home and stop this pain tonight

"event","yay! we had late start today! which rocked more than you know i rolled over and got up at 8! that felt so good. i loved it. usually we start at 7:45 which means i have to get up at 6 which is such a drag so that was awesome. so sheida picked up me and rochelle and then we went and got jenna. and we went to Einsten's Bagel's. and i got yummy chocolate chip bagle and green tea! the whole freaking highschool was in Einsten's this morning so there was like no where to eat and we had to wait. so we ended up being late, by like 10 minutes. 

so i decided to be a good girl and check in through the office and get a pass. which i found out i totally didnt have to do because my teached hadnt even taken roll yet! so because we had late start our class time was like 30 minutes, i didnt do anything except talk to Brittney about her litature book she choose, and we ended up choosing the same one so we can help each other. brittney fucking rocks. 

so then geometry which was a complete drag. stupid notes and i got counted off for my homework. 

3rd period-spanish. a really easy quiz over the stuff ive been learning the past 2 years. easy a. then we did book work =/ 

4th period. lunch! yay. except i got in a fight with robert because he didnt even call me when he went down to shanna's last night. how mean, so i yelled at him. and then dawn and him were all over each other. gross... its okay though cause i got her back after school <3 being mean to mean horriable people doesn't feel bad at all. Dave didnt talk to me. =( which was semi-dispointing. boys. ugh. mike and i broke up 2 nights ago..found out he was cheating on me the whole time. big disapointment. no understanding from anyone. 

5th hour- honors english. really hard vocab test which i got like a b. so yay for me and i didnt even study. 

then 6th period. honors chem. phys. went over some stuff found out i am not good at crossword puzzles and i cannot complete tonights homework. when i bell rang i picked up all my stuff and went to get up and Sean walked in!!!!!!!!! the only other freshmen that was at stefano's costume/aliayh's birthday party on saturday. i was really drunk and i made a fool out of myself, but i think i kinda like him. =) he sits right in front of me, except the period after mine! how sad i know. 

then dance where we just got hassled about selling stuff for the dance show and watched the spring show from last year. =) not to bad of a day."

////////
im going on a family vacation to visit family tomarrow morning i leave around 11ish to fly on a plane at 1. =( i get IHOP in the morning and i get to fly with my mom. But in my head all the negitives are out weighting the positives. i haven't seen my mom, really for the past 2 weeks, we finally got together yesterday and saw a movie. 

Mike hasn't called, and i don't think he ever will. i'm falling so fast. i'm just scared because when i hit the bottom will he be there? i've called today, twice. i called his sister, i even called will. i'd really like to see the boy that makes my face my hurt from smiling before i leave. i see him almost everyday and he leaves about 20-30 minutes away. =( i hate waiting by the phone.

i really can't wait to see my cosins, one in particular, paul, the cosin who is around 3 or 4 years older than me, because it seems like last time when we really started to talk it was the end of the trip, like we really could get along. In the past we haven't been close at all because of my cosin Micheal, 7 years older than i, but he is not even coming to see everyone so i guess i really don't care. I hate starting trips out with regrets of things said and prescriptiopns for anxiety. I don't want to go because im afraid if i leave there will be nothing to come back to, so i won't ever really come back but just float around in my world for the rest of my life.

so in the end i'm leaving on a jet plane tomarrow and i'm not when (or if) ill be back. i'll be back...*this up coming saturday* but there is no way i will be getting online, i get back and im going out. to see mike <3 i hope."

so i leave on a jet plane on monday at 1:20. wish me not so dead. i hate planes. i miss mike so very much. i went to his show last night and it was the best thing i have seen in a bajillion years. i snuck down to see him, and then we both snuck up and i woke up on his sisters floor all alone and i was sad. i was supposed to go with him tonight to where ever he is going, but i cant because his parents will be there and i am the biggest secret of your life. <3"

With Shanna's abortion which i do not support one bit, my belly button getting infected, Mike, and the chance that i myself am pregnant. i wanna scream. today was supposed to be the day of the abortion but Kim had to fuck things up and shanna changed her mind and got it scheduled for tomarrow. well we rode around in the car for a million hours, smoked alot of cigarettes felt really gross, and naustious. keep in mind that i spent the night at ""allys"" last night and i got about 3 hours of sleep because mike kept me up. so i get up early for absolutely nothing and i miss the early mike hours which are extremely fun because he's so sleepy and peaceful. and we ride around me, grumpy as fuck, feeling morning sicknessy, and completely exhuasted. so around 4 everyone decides that we should go to my house. so we do. and it was fun. and now i am so exhuasted. kim broke something.... and i felt like shit all day long because ive had absolutely no alone time to reflect on the fact that i could be having a baby. oh and today they drove me down to liquid karma where i got my surface pericing done and the guy that did it totally denies that he peirced me, and how that the barbell i have in is completely wrong and hows it curked and ""rejecting"" which is really nasty, so i took it out. but its not what i needed today at all. so im completely overwhelmed, i have a huge lack of sleep, and the only person who can make me feel somewhat good right now can't or doesn't want to see me...man i feel like shit. how could i ever have a baby. a fucked up mother i would be... the babies dad could be out of 2 guys, i smoke way to fucking much, i have an infected belly button, no job, no money, i just wanna scream.....

"event","so leigha and i went shopping last night.
bought undies. then walked like a mile to go see stephano<3. he took brake and we hung out, i finally got to see his car while i was sober. haha.
my dreams scare me considering, Leigha, Rochelle, Rob, Lauren(<lj user=alovelybride___>), Scott Stuck (kevin's friend who i havent seen since school got out), and Stephano.. so Lauren and i traded shoes, she had chucks and they were teal! and i fell in love with them. Rob was all over leigha and i was getting pissed? *hidden feelings?* but she insisted...maybe ill get over it. i sure to god hope so. and i want denny's so bad right now. haha i called stephano cause he woke me up when he got off work last night at like midnight so i called him at 8 his morning. 

so i have found the reason i have been cranky for awhile. the birthcontrol was making me a bitch. and i really dont know who i am anymore. i was living off of guys and i continue to do it... but im finding myself in the places i never thought looking. 

rochelle is out of town for 2 weeks.<3"

today was cigarette romance in the shade of a thousand lovely trees in rich neighborhoods. today was the afternoon break self-discovery of a boy who would do anything just to fly away. today was one, two, three drags you're in: into a world of smoke &lighters &incent smelling boys. into the addicting equation of lips plus cigarettes.

&how could i start something so beautifully ugly? how could i pass my addiction from my slender fingers to his? his lips never touched poison until they touched mine. yeah, i'm his tar princess; his <b>nicotine queen</b>.

but at least he'll be tangible.</lj-cut>"

"event","i never thought i could ever feel this way after rob.
its amazing, and the fact is im falling for a boy who gets a new girl every 2 weeks...do you think i could ever change his mind if i wanted to?
and why is it that boys never call?

so i went to rob's on sunday, my dad dropped me off. we talked. well he talked and i balled. i cried for like 2 hours. i feel so much better. we are no more. and that is a great thing to say right now. i am for sure. there is no liz and rob. no bad feelings nothing. a friendship indeed. i really hope rob chooses kim over patty. patty is way to plastiky for me. =). for now, i believe rochelle is mad at me. or semi-mad at me because ryan kissed me, and i kissed him back.....

wow. its like fireworks all over again. i am spinning in a world i havent existed in for awhile."

"event","okay, so i seriously think this is the first time i've been on livejounal for hm....maybe 6months? minimum.  well i just got the  internets back and i'm trying to catch up with everything i've been neglecting for so long.  For a start, i'm finally moving out of the student/real ghetto and into a really nice apartment in portage by myself(not really by myself, but anyhoo..).  I'm working a great job at milwood animal clinic, i get to play with puppies all day long!  i should be getting my first kitten here in the next couple of months, i should start to load up all the pics from my camera since the last few months here, so if you have me on myspace or facebook, you'll get to see those before too long.  I've gotten fat,(and happy!!)but me and the bride(elise, she's getting married in august...and i'm in it) are getting on a hard-core work-out/diet routine so we can be hot by the wedding, so problem solved.  also i'm about the happiest i've ever been with where i am in so many aspects of my life.(it's just that pesky career thing getting in the way) I have the most amazing person in my life who has made a world of difference in how i live and think everyday.(his name is nick;).
    honestly, i don't think i've ever had life this good.(knock on wood!!)  so now that i'm able to actually keep up with everybody it will be even better!
love you all!!!"

"event","okay, so i feel that this is update worthy.
last friday night we all decided it'd be a great idea to drink.  of course it was a great idea until it turned into ""let's get em as drunk as humanly possible"" night. after four shots of vodka and five smirnoff later, i had to be told the story of the night.  not only had i already drank too much, i continued to drink more with my friends, but my friends decided to take shots of water while mine were vodka.  i was unaware of this. next thing i remember i'm crawling in the grass outside getting rained on.  this kid nick had to come out and carry me inside. after this i'm blank again.  i spent the whole night puking, dry-heaving and passing out in the bathroom.  my lovely friends who got me so drunk were the ones holding my head inthe bucket 'o puke for more.  they stripped me of my pants(this i remember) then put me to bed on the floor next to Gina's bed.  they put up couch cushions on either side of me so i wouldn't roll over and choke on my own vomit.....i will reiterate this...they baby-bumpered me!!!
to any of you who have drank with me before that i brag of never having hang-overs.
fuck that!!!
i woke up the next morning(probably still drunk)in the worst pain of my life! headache, stomach ache, all i wanted was water and coffee.  so i have water.  i puke up the water.  i go to sleep.  i wake up thirsty.  life's a bitch.  i can't keep anything down and i had to work in two hours.
so i hop in the shower, but i could't stand up, so i laid down for a while. next thing i know it's a half-hour later and the steamy shower is ice cold. -that's right, i passed out in the shower.  so they can't find anyone to work for me(boss was drinking with me night before, knew how bad i was, but couldn't find anyone for me) so i still had to go to work.
talk about the worst night of my life. there were only three of us and we were busy. personal hell
so i ate ice cubes all day, and the lack of coffee made my headache worse, but if i were to have any, i'd puke.  vicious cycle. i couldn't eat until 9 that night, and it was a fucking peice of toast!
so ended my day of horror following my night of (apparent) fun....those bitches are going to get it

to all of you....i'm not an alkie"

i'm in kzoo now for the year, so come see me!  my place is pretty cool, but the color of the carpet in my room sucks, so i can't paint  it the color i wanted to...i'll probably just leave it, oh well.  it's a bit angled in places, but for the most part it's awesome.  i actually like my roommates, and i'm not paying $275/mo to live in an ice box on the first floor.  i'm paying $200/mo to live in a quite cozy little nook. i'm thrilled.

anyways, i guess i'll check y'all later!"

"event","so, nothing really too special happening here.  just working a ton and trying to enjoy my summer.  i'm coming down to kzoo next monday and i'll be there till wednesday. can't wait to see my kzoo crew!!!  i'm hoping to be able to work at super 8 doing the afternoon or night shift at the desk, that would be sweet.  i would still hang on to the large boy and work there on weekend mornings if i can, but i need something else a little more reliable.

i've been fighting with my sister a lot, but we make up pretty quick.  she tells me i was stupid and i tell her she was a bitch and then, other than a constant mutual annoyance, we get along okay.  i'm still not going to let her touch my car though.

i'm getting physical therapy for my knee, apparently my patella is all sorts of fucked up as well as possibly some cartilege damage.  we're waiting a month before my next check up and then if it's not better with the pt, i'll go in for an MRI.  we'll see.  for now i go in and he plays with my knee for a bit, puts on a battery powered pain medication patch and i go on my way(with exercises to do on the side). i've only had two appoinments, so there might be a bit more to this than just that, but we'll see.

well, there isn't really much else up, so i will see all you bitches in a week!!!


ps..maia, do you know if angie has trashed the place??  she still hasn't contacted me or paid me back for the consumer's bill....i'm not thinking that will happen....tire slashing may be required....or maybe AIM would take it out of her security deposit......not really"

"event","so recently life sucks for me hardcore.  something new every fucking day.  so you all know how i was working two jobs and shit, well...  father's day was the busiest day so far at applebee's and the kitchen was slow as hell.  the customers were mad, the managers were mad, and generally, eveyone was pretty irritable.  the way the managers are there is, they either love you or hate you and that's how they get by their busy days.  they yell at the one's they don't like because it's easier than yelling at the ones that deserve it.  mitch, the store manager was there and he was pissed as hell at the kitchen. my friend steve walked into the kitchen to see where his food was(perffectly normal) and got screamed at.  he later was written up, put on probation, and if he screws up in the next month, he gets suspended for a week.  then there was me.  three days shy of not being the new girl anymore(the first month they can do whatever they want with you and get away with it), they give me the option of a demotion to hostess.  
i have never been told i wasn't good enough before, that hurts. one may ask, ""why would they do this  to you?"" well i had a table that waited forever to get their food, and then when they did, one of the steaks was cold and they wanted it taken off of their tab.  somehow this was my fault and i was told i was stupid and couldn't handle it.
so with the offer of the new position, i said fuck it, i quit.  and i did.  i won't work in a place where my job is completely dependant on whether or not the manager got laid the night before.
so i went into my other job and talked to my boss, she promptly gave me a promotion.
i still won't make as much money as i would with two jobs, but it's something.

i figure, with the level of karma i'm attaining i'll win the fucking lotto.

and katie....go for it baby!"

"event","okay, the last two days have been hell...i mean HELL!!!!!  so yesterday started at 8am cleaning rooms, not as bad as usual.  i was optimistic for the rest of the day.  this is where old testament God (jew God) comes out instead of new testament God(nice and friendly).  I go to work at applebee's and my first table walks out without paying.  it was a $33 bill.  usually they would make me pay that out of my tips, but i got the good manager, and he comp'd it for me.  after that it was all downhill.  my tables sucked, the kitchen sucked, and the managers sucked even worse.  i was on the verge of tears for about three hours straight.  

the other day, i got a notice in the mail from consumer's energy saying that we never paid a bill from april for about $228.  this is due on the 20th or else my credit goes up to shit.  i JUST paid my rent from about two weeks ago(i talked to them, they understood)  and now i'm stuck with this bill for an extra $57.  this has to get in the mail in the next two or three days for it to get there on time.  i'm fucked.

to put the icing on the cake, i'm due for my depo BY the 16th.  so i went to the health department the other day to get it and it just so happens that the RN is out of country for the next three weeks and i can't get it done there. my only option is to go through my insurance, sure, no problem.  so i call planned parenthood in kalamazoo for help and they called in a prescription to rite aid and i went to pick it up.  turns out my insurance doesn't cover it if it's not a mail-in order. the price? $175.  needless to say, i don't have an extra $175 and $57 laying around the house let alone the cost of having to take that prescription to the doctors and having them inject me with it.
why the fuck do they make it so hard for someone to get bc?  what if i were a teenager scared to death to get on it in the first place and they made it this difficult??? that's why this town has so many damn babies with babies.
anyways, i'm not afraid of having babies, i'm afraid of what my body is going to do.  if i don't get something, this will be the first time in 5 years i haven't had estra horomones in my system.  i'm going to be even more fucked up emotionally and not to mention have my first period in two and a half years.
the only plus side to this situation??  weight loss.  ...hmmm yup that's it

i'm so pissed off right now, i just want to know what the fuck i did to deserve all this shit."

i think i might start plotting how, when, and where to kill my sister and where to dump the body within the next few weeks.
I AM NOT A TAXI!!!!!
i hate when people take advantage of me.  maybe if you weren't such a bad driver and rolled your car you wouldn't be in this pathetic position!!  and suck it up and get ajob!! even if it is cleaning rooms, i know that it's below you, but there's nothing else here for you unless you feel like working at mcdonald's!!! fuck you!!!

"event","so, i don't know what the hell has happened.  the last few days have been such a blur.  i ache.  i find myself crying at work when i'm looking for a peice of paper, i cried making a bed.  i should say work is a blessing, taking my mind off of things, but it may be worse, i might be too distracted.  i'm so confused right now, and i'm really scared for next week, my mom and my sisters will be gone for four days and i'll be alone, just work to occupy me.  i go on an emotional roller coaster every five minutes.  someone will make me laugh and i'm happy, and then i think of who i'm not going to see the next day and i crash.  i can't tell if i'm smart by looking ahead, or extremely stupid for panicing.
i doubt i'm making any sense right now, because i don't even make sense to myself.  i need to talk to someone, but no one seems to think i need it because i'm the one who started this whole mess...maybe i deserve it.  i hate hurting people

ouch.  

but i may even get some money before too long.  i still have to pay rent and pay a $50 energy bill all due on the first. i'm not going to have any money for another week and a half, and i won't have enough money for all of that for even longer.  i'm going to call AIM and explain the situation and maybe they'll let me pay a little bit late.  if not i suppose i'll have to suck it up and ask if i can get a loan from my mom.(if she even has it)

"event","so...i feel loved.  the other day, (friday) i left my cell phone with my sis as i was at work and thought that would be a great idea.  so when i finally got back, me and my sister left straight away to go and rent some movies and were gone for a considerable amount of time.  so i got back and i saw that i had over twenty-two messages from elise and other various people of the same group trying to call me.
...so i call her back.  she tells me promptly that i was supposed to be over at her house for a party.

this is where it is important to note that she had told me a week before that on friday night, i was hers.  this part i remembered clearly.  my problem was that i thought it was thursday.  upon this realization i uttered a swift ""oh shit"" and got in the car.

when i got there(almost midnight), there were streamers, balloons, and everyone shouting ""surprise!"".  i was late for my own surprise going away party.  letting that be, i still had a great time and had a few cosmos and hung out with some people that i'm really going to miss.

this brings us to today, my last day of work.  i was covering a shift for another girl and was working mine, which made my shift an 8-8...ouch.  i had about an hour long window at about 3 oclock where i was planning on going to tan so i could feel something good(my knees were killing me and we were crazy busy).  HOWEVER!  as soon as i got my cleanups done(which took forever) and was off the clock, i was called to the back for a second.

imagine something large and white in the hand of a girl so sweet she'd give you a toothache.
then imagine this large and white thing coming closer and closer to your face.
slow motion as her sweet face turns to a grimace.
you've just been hit in the face with a pie.
yes.
i said pie

as soon as the shock wore off...i attacked.
the second big boy whip cream fight(that i've started) ensued.
people later expressed shock that i had retaliated with the whip...i told them they need to hang out with me more, and then they'd come to expect it.

all in all, these were two great sending-offs showing me people really do care.

i'm going to miss it here."

SINGLE SPACED!!!! who the fuck does that???  so that one grade brought me from an A to a C.  a fucking C in african religions...because of a book review??? don't you think the grade in the class should be based on things more like, how much we actually know about african religions?  fuck. this. shit.  i'm not happy.  fuck mirzeler and his single spaced shit. fuck his teaching method that teaches us nothing about african religions, but about african history....okay, this i can understand to a point, becuase to understand the religion we have to understand the culture, but there was nothing following the history lesson to even resemble religion or ritual!!! fucking a."

"event","i hate/love this time of year.  This has been one of the best years of my life.  I've made so many new friends who care about me and who i can talk to, i've always had that, but i never had the confidence that i could actually go out and make new friends by myself.  I have so much more self-confidence, even though i think i'll always be insecure. that's what western society does to girls.  
i've had a few tiffs with roommates, had more laughs with friends, and a couple of different jobs.  I've had some stressful classes with stressful profs, and some really funny ones.  i hated my room, my house, and my bills.  i've had a car explode on me, and i've wanted to explode on some people.
the place i'm living in next year is amazing, and so are my future roommates.  It's even a possibiliy that the people living in the first floor will be some of my awesome friends.
so here it is that i end this year with some finally paid bills, some friends left behind, and a HUGE anticipation and excitement for next year.
i'm going to enjoy the next twelve days i have here by getting some books and laying out in the sun in the grass.  that's one thing about here that you can't do in the soo....i'll miss that

however there is the potential problem of finding a job in the soo when i get there, because as of now, i'm still going to have to pay rent. and when i finish at big boy on the 7th. i'm unemployed with no money.  that'll give me about two and a half weeks to come up with $275....eek.

for now, i'm going to try and not think about that at all, and just chill.  all else fails, i come back, and that's not so bad, now is it?

i love you all and i hope you have great summers.  come and see me if you get the chance!!"

I wanted to get up early for all the shit i have to do today.  I try to read a book that is due back today because i can't not finish a book.  turns out it stressed me out more (the devil wears prada...all about a super stressed-out assistant)  didn't finish it.  i'll be late.  so then i look at accounting that's due tonight at 6:30.  stumped.  flat-out stumped.  can't do it.  called roommate, doesn't know how to do it.  e-mailed other guy in class, doesn't know either.  I'm still fucking stumped.  so i don't do it.  I also have a paper due tomorrow i haven't even started, and i have to pack for tomorrow as well....there will be no sleep tonight.

went to campus to print out stuff for other teacher and to turn into mailbox.  i left the other papers i needed at home.  had to go back home to get papers, return to campus and turn them in.  by this time, tank is on E and need to get to gas station.  decide to go to cheaper ones on westnedge.  light isn't on yet, so no problem.  get on the ramp from 131 to 94.  car dies.  car fucking dies....and oops!! turns out i forgot cell phone at home.  the one...fucking...time.

so there i sit, waiting for cop or good samaritin feeling very vulnerable and lost without cell phone.  wait for about half hour.  it's rush hour. dozens of people speeding past. they stare, but don't stop. no cops either.  no fucking luck.

after half hour, and i swear, not three minutes after i said little prayer, lady pulls over in tan minivan.  me, overcome with gratitude.  i cry, she hugs me....strange what people will do with complete strangers.  she offers to take me to get gas.  i leave sticky note on windsheild with hopes that cops NEVER pass by and tow me or ticket me.  we talk, and listen to Christian rock.  lady tells me God made her turn around to check on me. (to all you non-religious people, go ahead and roll your eyes, i don't care) lady takes me to her house, we pick up a gas can, fill it up and head out to my car.  thank God it's still there!  i say my grateful thank-you's and she says God bless, and we go our separate ways.

what is the first thing i hear on the radio?.....calling all you angels.

you all know that i'm not normally and outwardly religious person, but days like today remove all question for me."

"event","okay, so kalamazoo is getting awesome right now.  the trees are budding and there are flowers all over the place.  true, i'm stressing out like crazy for finals, but everthing else is doing awesome right now.  i don't want to go back to sault ste siberia where life is going to suck again.  there is no nice place where i can just plop down and read all day, there are no places to go and putz around except wallmart, and my old friends from high school are still in the same place they were when i left.  they'll always be there, with the same job, probably married to the guy they've been with since high school, and the same circle of friends who do nothing but gossip about who's pregnant now.  there are people i love there, but the stress and the lack of money-making ability is astounding.  i've decided kalamazoo is home for me now, this summer will only be a visit.

isn't it strange how our self-conscious can adapt to new situations and how we change as people over a short period of time?  I truly beleive i am a very different person than i was, and i might not be done changing.  rewind two years and i was happy as a clam in the soo, and didn't want life to change too much...well, life changed a lot without my permission and here i am.  i am completely torn between the two lives i have.  i know the other isn't the one i'll keep, so why do i go back?  promises and loved ones.  On one hand, i have the choice, but to my sub-conscious, i don't.  

there's nothing but drama up there, and i'm about to trow myself into it.  don't get me wrong, because there's plenty of drama here too, but there it's the same thing over and over again.  my body can't take that much draining.  i don't want to go to my mom's fourth wedding, i don't want to work shit jobs to get enough, and i don't want drama!

i just keep looking at the calendar and see that i only have so much time left and i panic.  how will i say goodbye to everyone i need to?  how will i feel that it's enough?  i won't see these people for months!  i won't be able to afford the gas to come down often, if at all.  i filled up yesterday and it cost me $50.  That's $100 round trip, not including food and such.

i'm going to miss everyone and everything so much.

"event","Once upon a time, in a land far away,
a beautiful, independent, self-assured princess
happened upon a frog as she sat contemplating ecological issues
on the shores of an unpolluted pond
in a verdant meadow near her castle.
the frog hopped up into the princess' lap and said:
sweet lady, i was once a handsome prince,
until an evil witch cast a spell on me.
one kiss from you, however,
and i will turn back into the dapper young prince that i am.
then, my sweet, we can marry
and set up house in yon castle
where you can prepare my meals,
clean my clothes, bear my children,
and forever feel grateful and happy doing so.
that night, dining on a repast of lightly sauteed frogs' legs,
the princess chuckled to herself and thought:
i don't fucking think so.

"event","okay, i'm going to say my piece.  if you don't want to hear it, move on to the next website in your itinerary.  I realize that I'm not there, and it's not really my business, but when it's one of my friends getting harassed for standing up for her boyfriend, i have a problem.  even if it is with my boyfriend.  some shit happened.  the way it was explained the first time, i would be upset too(and am). I would be, and am upset at the second telling of it.  there are a few people changing stories and some people blindly taking sides. it's only been a couple of days and people keep freaking out like it's the end of the world for christina.  this will be resolved. it may never be the way that it was before, but it will get better.  forgiveness doesn't happen overnight.  it took me well over 5 months before i could forgive her before.  she may be sorry, but that doesn't take it back.  for me as well as katie, there was no excuse for what happened.  drunk or not.  you don't attack your friends out of anger..ever.  i especially don't appreciate people posting mean, name-calling comments(gender specific), katie is not a fucked up woman and i don't beleive women have fucked up heads.  that infuriates me.

my point is that no matter what the original situation was, you don't treat your friends that way. that goes for more than one person in this case.


ps.  for those of you who are perplexed by this, never mind"

NO RENT!!!  I envy them, too bad their life span is only a couple of years when they manage to not get run over, eaten by a hawk, falcon, or other predator.  THey have real fears instead of ours, which is whether or not we'll get a job, pay rent, get fired, lose freiendships, and other things.
Don't know exactly i got on this whole mindset, but hey, there it is.

I might stay here for a week extra just so I can enjoy reading outside without homework to worry about.  Real relaxation.  Impossible."

I've been up all night just to get my homework done, and I originally thought that once I was done, I would have like, two or three hours to try and stay awake with nothing to do, but no! When I got done with homework, it was time to go pick up the girls....they're enough of a pick-me-up as it is. I'm still wearing the same clothes that i wore yesterday, never changed 'em.  I've just got to get through the next few hours and then I can go home and crash....at least for a few hours, tonight is free popcorn night and $3 movies!!  I can't bail.   That wouldn't be right.  Then some drinks tonight, I'll be passed the fuck out by 10, I'd almost put money on it.
I need all this stress to go away.  Even when I'm done with class, I still have work for the next four or five days.  I've been picking up extra shifts, working at the other store, and working doubles all this last week.  I just got done asking my manager to work me more, and on the days I can, which is the weekend, and now Jeff, Katie, and Notch are coming down, and I'll have to work the whole time.  Especially since I've been making such a big deal about my schedule for the last two or three weeks, me not having enough money so they feel sorry for me.  Jeff, I'm so sorry, and katie and Notch, I'm more sorry.  I'm kinda in a pickle, but I'll do what I can.  Thank you for being so patient with me, I know i've been a combo of bitchy/impatient/snappy/emotional.  You are all saints (especially jeff).
Again sorry, and I'll be better after a nap."

Why does my stress level over eveything seem to change when I don't have to worry about money?  I'm such a freak about it sometimes.  I guess I just don't want to end up like my mom did...or Mandy for that matter, but I don't think credit cards are magic and I know when to ask for help when I need it, so that's not probable.  Any-who, I actually got to sleep in this morning, finish a really good book(Memoirs of a Geisha) take time getting ready this morning, and I feel good damnit!!!
I still have to write a two page French paper and go to accounting tonight, but I get to make brownies after!!  So today is good.  For once, today is good.

A constant feeling of needing to put yourself out there to be loved by people you know already love you.  Constantly putting on a happy face when you're really feeling something horrible in the pit of your stomach.  I don't think I'm making any sense, but if it fits, let me know.

"event","So good to be back in kzoo.  I love my family, but recently they decided to suck.  I miss Jeff and Katie, Notch, and Christina....but Jeff is coming down sometime next week (hooray!!).  So here is why I'm glad to be back.

For Marty's Christmas present, Mom flew his son up from OKC.  She asked if it would be okay with me after she already bought the ticket.  What can I say after that?? no? sorry, too late.  The ticket was about $250, he was supposed to fly into Detroit and my sister was going to pick him up.  The two of them were then going to catch a ride home with Ian a day later, so there are a few people's schedules resting on when he gets here.  So my sister goes to the airport and waits for about an hour and a half after his flight landed, and then she went to talk to an  official. Apparently the jackass never got on the plane.  Anna tried calling him for hours after that, leaving messages, e-mailing and generally doing all she could to get him.  She finally did and he was like ""oh, sorry, I didn't think it was so soon""--BULLSHIT!!  Both my mom and Anna talked to him and confirmed through e-mail the day and time he was supposed to catch it.

So Anna calls the airline and re-scheduled his flight for the next day.  She had to pull $150 out of her ass on the spot for this kid.  So then she calls him and tells him his flight is the next day at 11:45.  him:""Uh, I have a doctor's appointment at 12 tomorrow that's going to be really hard to re-schedule.  Do you think we could do this the same time next year instead?""

Can you beleive this????

Needless to say, Anna got his ass on the plane. (this is not a good sign from this kid)
So I let him take over my room and stay there for the three weeks he's going to be there.  I slept on the spare bed in my little sister's room...quite uncomfortable, but all this is to make Mom happy. I grin and bear it...it could be worse, actually this isn't so bad.

Then the relatives get there.  We had ten extra people in my grandparent's house that we had to try and entertain with every bit of freetime we had...just about every night for about 7 or 8 hours.---not kidding.  That alone I wouldn't have a problem with, I love my family and I love to be with them.  My cousins are starting to become really cool, and my aunts are a lot of fun.

My problem with it I guess was how easily Kyle(Marty's son)dove into the situation.  He acted like he was in the family for years, joking with my cousins, helping himself to my grandparent's stash of candy on top of the fridge that I'm still scared to touch.  When my cousin tickle-attacked me, he joined in...very uncomfortable.  

I don't know what to think about it.  He's an only child and I have a very huge family and it seems that he's starved for attention and just wants to be a part of it so badly.  I know he's in a very odd situation and he doesn't know anyone and just wants to fit in, which is why it's so hard for me to take a position on how I can judge him.

The one request I made of my Mom over the summer when Marty moved in was for us to hae a Christmas morning with just family.  The last two years we had problems with Steve causing a ruckus. So Marty and his son were there anyways, there was nothing I could say.  It would've been selfish.

Then my mom started to push it.  She wanted us all to go with her, Marty, and Kyle to St. Ignace on Christmas Eve to be with thier family for the day.  Christmas fucking Eve!!  The time you're supposed to be with family and wrapping presents.  For me Christmas Eve is more important family-wise than Christmas day itself.  Like fuck I'm going to spend 7 hours with people that I've never met on Christmas Eve!!  So I didn't go, but Mom pulled the hurt look.  Bitch.

One of the traditions that is never fucked with in my family is to have potato soup on Christmas Eve.  It's supposed to remind us that family can still come together and be happy even if all we can afford is potatoes.  We had it two days early this year, so we could fit it into everyone's schedules.  Never happened before, but it happened this year.  Whatever, I didn't say much, at least we still had it.  

I'm going to throw this in here too, even though it seems really petty.  I'm ashamed to even be upset about it and maybe a little bit immature as well.  In our stocking line-up for Christmas, we are lined up in order from oldest to youngest.  Kyle is two months older than me.  His was put between me and my sisters.  If someone had told me that that would upset them, I would probably tell them they were reading way too much into it, but it really hurt...petty.

Okay, here's the kicker.  Christmas Eve. Grandparent's house.  Twenty people present.  Marty proposes to Mom. Mom says yes.  Family is happy.

HOW THE HELL CAN THEY BE HAPPY WITH THIS????  The divorce wasn't even final for a year and she's doing it again.  This is number FOUR!!!  I don't understand how this could be encouraged.  I've never felt like a guest in my own home before, and that is exactly what Mom said she didn't want to happen.  Too late.  I don't want to live there this summer.

I don't know if I'm just being immature, or if this really is an unfair situation.  I really don't know how to put this into perspective.  I counciled my mom everyday to get her through the last divorce.  It put me and Tess through Hell.  I think I've earned my right to be skeptical."

On the bright side, I had a vision today...that's right, vision, fuckers.  I really think that the only profession I can really be happy with is maybe dog therapy.

"event","okay, i've been doing research for this paper I have due Monday on female genital mutilation.  These girls, and I do mean girls(usually 8 years old) are taken out of their homes in the middle of the night and taken to a river or rock or other place outside where a midwife takes either a sharp rock, peice of glass, or peice of metal.  UNSTERILIZED!!!!  She continues to cut off the clitoris, both labia, and then will put the two sides together held with sometimes thorns, only leaving a small hole for urine and her period.  With all of that, she can possibly die, get AIDS, have severe infections, and you can't even imagine the pain.  Once she is married, the husband has to cut the opening so he can have sex with her, and there have been cases of death after this, not to mention severe infections again.  When she has to give birth to a baby, if there is no one there to help her, the baby is stuck and they both die.  In the hospital, they cut her wider for the birth, and then they stitch her back up so she can be ""tight"" for the husband again.
please tell me i'm not the only one absolutely enraged by this.  count your fucking blessings"

"event","i've decided that i have either done something very bad to someone or i have something really good coming my way.  my karma is so fucked up right now.  the computer is dead.  yup. dead.  not the monitor that jeff already ordered and cost $80 to get there, and not anything else that he tried.  so i have no computer.  sounds like i'll be spending a lot of time in the computer lab for the rest of the year, as i did last year.  i might just spend the rest of my loan on a laptop instead of paying part of it back like i told my mom i would do.  i can already feel the wind of her screaming at me when she finds out how i spent $5,000 in a semester.  I don't even know how i did that one.
also, i'm really upset about work.  i finally found a job that i like and that pays me, and that HIRED me!!!(20-something-ish place i applied)  but this holiday situation isn't going to work out.  i still need to talk to my manager about it, but i can't ever find him!!!  i'm going to try and find another one for second semester, and i'm pretty sure one of the burger king's at home will let me work for break. it's four weeks long this year, so i could be home for a while if it weren't for my job now.  there's just no way i could quit without another job lined up, and i really don't want to, i actually like working there.
projects!! holy shit projects!!!  i have already lost count, but i know they're all due within the same two days, the 21, and the 22.  i think i am really starting to lose it.  i have no clue how i'm going to finish this semester, and i'm not sure how i'm going to pass one of my classes.
that's all the complaining i have for now, i guess"

"event","okay, so i need to find some way to get rid of all this stress.  i'm really good at being able to function with it, but i keep having little panics inside my head all day.  i'm not doing all that great in my easy classes that are suppose to keep my gpa afloat, and i don't know how i'm going to make that up.  i go to do homework and i just glaze over, i'm freaking out about being able to come home for christmas for more than a day. apparently a week is ludicris and the people at work apparently have no families, and don't realise that i can't just ""run home"" and come back that easy.  that's 5 hours in a car plus the gas money...one way.  this is my sister's last christmas at home for the next two possibly three years, and i need to be home for longer than a day.  my guess is htat i'll have to drive home christmas eve and come back three days later...if i'm lucky.  if it weren't so hard to find a job in this town, i'd quit.  sadly though, i need it.  and they know it.  I need Jeff to get here.  i need a hug."

Benefits of the night: new doorknob(lockable), new food in kitchen, french homework done, newspaper read, comics caught up on, dishes mostly done, laundry would be done if I wasn't scared of our basement at night, showered, caffeinated(heavily), tv watched(intravenously through the night, daydreams 54, and sun now shining through my windows.  Class is done at 1:45 and i may take a nap, then must study for exam on wednesday and again for thursday.  then get deservedly drunk off my ass thursday night.  Well, class starts in about an hour and still have to go to campus to print off assignment. Hope dearly to stay awake through exam review today.  I'll have a quad-espresso please....straight."

"event","so work is good.  I think I'm going to like it there.  It's relatively simple and after three months I'm a member of the union and they can't fire me.  Which means there won't be a problem with me coming home for the summer.  They have something called school leave, which would let me do it.  I have two exams Monday and they're huge.  So much info on them. I might study tonight and be lame because Mandy at least is being lame and is hogging Jason by making him watch movies with her friends, who are mostly superficial. I like maybe three of them.  The rest are valley girls and valley gays.  I like most gay men, but these are just not my type.  
I don't think I'm going to be able to come home for thanksgiving.  I was talking to a girl at work and she said that everybody that they'll let already have the time off.  So yeah. I'll have five days off from school and no way to come home.  Well, I think angie will be here and so will mandy, so we'll have our own thanksgiving.
My back hurts.  I bend over at a wierd angle all day bagging groceries. Ouch.  I don't know how this is going to work out with the french guy. Actually he's from Tunisia I think.  He talked to me for four hours in French last night and I really had to try hard to get rid of him politely.  He called me his first real friend here and was acting like we've been friends for years.  I understand he's really excited to find someone who speaks his language and is nice to him, but personally I found him a bit annoying.  I thought it was going to be something like I'd show him around Kalamazoo and teach him a bit of english, but now he's talking like I'm going to see the kid once every week.  I don't know if I can pull that off.  Talking to him is good practice for me, but he was talking about how he thinks that Jews are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.  I'm not kosher with that.  At all.
I don't know."

"event","school sucks.  I've been working for the last two weeks on catching up on shit, writing shit, reading shit, and pulling shit out of my ass. Apparently my ass contains shit that gets me A's though.  I'm okay with that.  Grade-A shit.  So becuase our power went out yesterday, I had to reset my alarm...no problem for the average person, right?? Apparently wrong.  I set the alarm and all that for am, (was very cautious of that) however I was not so cautious with the actual time setting. It was for pm.  So I woke up this morning at 9 when I had class at 9:30 and still had to run to the Bernhard Center to print off stuff for my presentation.  Well this is how i do:  got ready in 10 minutes( by the way, had to be semi-dressed up for presentation, so couldn't skip on makeup or put hair in mat) and got my ass out the door and to the Bernhard Center, and actually made it to class on time.  I swear the gods that cursed me with my money troubles have to love my ass, cause that's what I keep saving.

I hate campus right now.  This is my favorite time of year and they abolutely tore campus to shit.  I can't enjoy it. That makes me sad.  They even went to the swan pond and took away the benches, the bushes, the fish, and they won't let you feed the ducks anymore.  Everything that I loved about campus last year is gone. Fucking Bailey and her two million dollar office.  FUCK CORRUPTION!!!!  Oh, and they're not going to tear down McCracken until the state takes action because it has asbestos in it, and that way they don't have to pay for it.  Fuck her.

oh and now my mom thinks I'm some sort of slut because I want to get my hood peirced.  I wish mandy would learn she can't tell beth about that kind of thing, she'll tell mom.  I wasn't completely sure that I wanted it done before, but now I think I want it done out of spite.  We'll see."

Right now just waiting for 4:30 to come around so I can cash this fucking loan check.  I swear the money gods hate me.  Nothing can be easy. Gaaahhh! Oh well, hopefully all will be better by 5.  If not, I shall go on a spree of insanity killing everyone in my way.  Roommates beware!  So maybe tomorrow I can start paying people back. Mostly Jeff, but also Maia.  Then I'm fucking going shopping. *shudder* I just saw the largest girl EVER walking around in little more than something to cover her chest.

"event","Well, school's started and things are starting to fall into place.  I got a call today from Bob Evan's.  The guy left a message(he called me in class) that I was supposed to be there for an interview this morning and he still wants me to come in.  BULLSHIT!!!  When they cancelled my interview, they wanted me to come in this morning and I told them that I had class and couldn't.  They took my number and said they'd call to reschedule. Well, the message must have gotten fucked up somewhere, because I've told them about three times now that I HAVE CLASS AT 9AM!!!!  You'd think the fuckers would take a hint!
Well, at least they seem eager to interview me, so maybe this is a good thing.  I still think I'm going to apply at Damon's, that's got to be better than Bob Evan's.  I have a feeling that they may regularly fuck up my schedule.  grrr....frustration.
So this morning me and Allison went to school and I still have my schedule written down on a paper that I kept with me yesterday in my pocket.  I immediately freaked out when we got there (shut up Jeff, you can stop laughing and saying ""I knew it!"" to the computer).  I swore I didn't have it with me and had left it in my pocket yesterday.  I was thinking I would have to run to the library, fuck with the computers, and find my class and be late.  Two seconds later I checked in my wallet to see if I had remembered my ID to get into the computer lab, and I found my paper.  I need to stop freaking out so damn easy.  I need to visit a spa for like, a lifetime.  I need to be not so high strung.
Okay, I think I'm going to go outside and get some reading done while I wait for Allison to be done with class.  It's nice out, I think I'm finally going to enjoy some summer weather."

"event","well... it's been awhile, so here it is.  I'm on day six of working 11 days straight, three of them are 11 hour shifts.  Because of my shit-ass car breaking down in K-zoo, I no longer have book money and have to borrow from family (HATE that!)  There's drama at work between the car hops which is getting everybody stressed out and tense (there are only women working there).  

My mom said Marty was going to try and stay the night not only on the weekends, but a couple of nights during the week.  Marty lives in St Ignace for those of you who don't know.  Little did I know that a couple of days a week meant every day of the week.  Not only that, but now he's parking in the garage and mom's parking outside because he just washed his precious Cougar.  My little sister likes him, which is good...but she's getting attatched.  She has had no real father figure in her life except for my grandpa.  If she gets too attatched and things don't work out, she'll be devastated and never trust men, or mom ever again.  I can't say that I would blame her.  She's just falling so fast over having the man that her mom is with be nice to her and even like her, it hurts to see how much she craves his attention ust because he'll give it to her.  I'm not sure, but maybe the thing I'm worried about the most is that the three of them create a happy little family and me and the rest of my sisters are left out of the picture.  Okay, if I don't stop myself here I just won't stop and I can't handle emotion right now.

I can't wait to see you guys, I'll be there the 28th."

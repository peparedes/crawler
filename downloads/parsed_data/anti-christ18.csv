"event","FUCK YOU. Simple as that. 

Can't do a lot of things now. Like this evening for instance. I've been at home for about a week now,haven't left but once to get some articles of clothing back from Sky's house. Other than that, I have been in front of the computer. I think I have watched Sahara like 20 times since Wed. cause the stupid satellite people still haven't gotten our payment,which was sent over a week ago. Looks like ima be stuck at home again,despite if i can barrow my grandmothers car or not...

Gots a job interview on tuesday...Circuit City.hopefully its in the back,thats where i applied for.

May go and get my hair trimmed too. Cannot decide. To much other bullshit conflicting in my head right now.

HA, this is what i get for thinking things could always be the same. For being me. Lol i love the fact that i know no-one reads this, and i could probably say what is wrong, but i still do not, just in case. 

People don't remember things...its sad. Most are just blind, cannot see past their own little world, others just can't remember cause of ""outside"" influences.

GOD im bored. Lol damn i actually resorted to using my live journal to vent and be all emo again...lol.sad.

Ima just be more of a complete asshole to everyone now...Far easier than to put up a front, act all happy. That and its more fun! So yeah this country is fucked...was talking with a friend of mine a lil bit ago, she is having a horrible time for i dont know how long. Things to do with family and stuff,i guess she's tried the cops and C.P.S. and  they haven't done a thing. I think ima try and help her get back up to Spokane, pawn/sell anything i can...Her situation is so sad and shit...So unto them FUCK YOU TOO.

I dunno anymore,like i dont really know what else i wanna divulge into this at this point,maybe at a later date i dunno,so yeah.just remember...we all suck,just some more than others :) night."

you simply must understand,for some of you that is(ie..,jon and michelle...),i just randomly stop calling people for long periods of time.dont ask me why because i do enjoy being around you and all that jazz,just sometimes i figure that you get sick of me and such,because that is quite easy to do,so i am told,well told by my own mind that is.there have been times in which i have wanted to call people and then i just figure ""hey...they will most likely have something better to do than to see me...""


then there are some of you that i care for more than friends...honestly i dont know what to say here so ima do a lil dance...::stands up...waves arms in the air,starts moving hips around...while yelling,WEO-WOP-WOP-WOP-WOP-TURKIES!"".i dunno,im a fucked up kid,i take everything entirely to seriously,what was some fun in the begining,turned into me having tons of affection for you(yet again,my fault),more than you will ever know,and more than you ever wanted in the first place.oh well.ill deal,and will get over it.as that dumb but oh so true quote goes,""time heals all"",no matter how much i dont want it to....yay.im making a fool outta myself.


anyway,yes,that feels better to get rid of...i have been harboring upon these things for sometime now...thinking and examining every little detail over and over in my head...its starting to drive me insane!!lol...but yes,back onto track,i have a new job now...working to move to seattle,though i may end up scratching that idea for a few years or so...save up,get all of my shit in order...or just save up to go to europe...one of those will work...later all."

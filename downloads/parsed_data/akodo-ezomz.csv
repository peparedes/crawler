"event","So I had never really planned on posting in this thing again, but I'm bored on a Monday so what the heck.

Ok let's see. Stuff that has happened since I last posted. Umm...I finished college. Graduated in May 2007 with a Bachelor's in Music. Since then, I've been doing mostly composition work. I just finished scoring the movie ""Funny How the Seasons Change"" for the Edwood Film Festival. It will be premiring in mid-August. There's a best composer award which I hope I win, it would look awesome on my resume.

I've been working with two vocalists on my various producing projects as of late: my friend and former classmate Eva, and another girl who I recently met named Ciara. Both of them are very talented and I have high hopes for the results of both projects.

On weekend nights I work for AlbanyAlive.com (Dan Dineen's website). I don't get paid, but I do get free drinks at most bars in Albany, and my ""job"" consists taking pictures of random groups of people at said bars. I've made many business contacts while working for Albany Alive, including DJs, A&Rs, and the owners and managers of the various bars.

As for a paying job, I've had zero luck finding a paying studio job, so I've decided to get a job at a local musician store until something better comes along. I may start teaching piano lessons again too.

And of course, playing L5R when I'm free. I can totally win Gencon this year.

That's it, domes. Peace out."

Thefts, breakages, concerts, relationships, parties, Jamie, J2, Mak, Andrea, Elena, bad times, good times. Anything that's remotely related to this trend of...crazyness.

Not just in like, a LiveJournal, either. This is going to be a grand tale unlike anything ever before. You see, I've come to the conclusion that a muse somewhere has decided to rewrite my life to make it more interesting, and the only thing I can do is put everything that happens on paper. It may not even end up being a story about me; there are many complex characters in this story with every sort of relationship with each other. My goal is to figure it all out, and I hope that by writing it down I can put the pieces together in my mind.

I will call it Unlucky, and it will be, at the very least, the most ridiculous thing I've ever written.

I will start writing, tomorrow."

I'm living in a suite with 5 other guys from my freshman hall. We have lofted beds which is awesome...it's like my room has two floors. I'm in a real band now; we're called Spacecataz and we plan to rock this campus once we get a few more practice sessions in. I'm also the events coordinator for the Undergraduate Musicians' Council (UMC), which basically means I book the rooms for our events and stuff. This year is looking really good for the UMC thus far, we had a great turnout at our first meeting.

Other than that umm...life is good. Looks as if J2, Joey and Makinson may be dropping in this weekend for a visit. Oh, and I'm going to see Death Cab right here in Rochester, this October. How awesome is that. Ok, I'm out, peace."

"event","When I got home at 4AM the other night, there was a random copy of Blender, a music magazine, sitting on the kitchen table. I certainly didn't order it, but I was curious, so I read most of it. It was pretty much what I expected: Fall Out Boy was on the cover, and the magazine seemed to rotate between ""emo is cool"" and ""emo is gay"" depending on which band they were talking about. There were a couple things of interest though; apparently Michelle Branch is back as part of a new countryish duo called The Wreckers. I don't really like country but I do like Michelle Branch so I'll probably check it out. The magazine also had the new Snow Patrol album pretty high up on their ""music to download"" list. I had already been planning to download it, but apparently they've gone pretty mainstream ever since a song from the CD was playing on the season finale of Grey's Anatomy.

Also, and I'm sure <lj user=""bitterlies""> will love this, even Blender pretty much hated Angels and Airwaves. They gave the debut album 2 stars out of 5, which was the lowest rating of any album they reviewed this month. I guess nobody likes them and they will probably die, haha. Whatev.

Some updates on life right quick: going to Origins in Columbus next week in the POWER VAN. Going  back to Rochester at some point later in the summer with Jamie to visit people. My manager at work said that I was ""his favorite delivery driver"". I guess I rock at the pizzas.

Last Wednesday, I went to a Stars concert in Toronto with James. It was awesome. I mean, how many other bands bust out a solo with the lead singer and keyboardist doing a *trumpet duet* in the middle of one of their songs? THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. :)

Last Friday, I think I finally figured out the last lesson that Marianne taught me. It's so obvious now I don't even want to talk about it, haha.

Last Saturday, I went 7-0 in the swiss of the Mass Kotei with Lion, eventually lost to Dragon (Dagron!) in the top 8.

There was a lot of talk about Alzheimer's disease, since it was the focus of the case which Spader tried during the episode, and it's the disease which Shatner's character has. At the end of the episode, when Denny and Alan were out on the balcony, smoking cigars, Denny said, ""You know, Alan, my day's coming soon. There's nothing I can do to stop it.""

"event","I find it odd that the recognition of one's own merits can be construed as arrogant. I mean, saying that I'm the best composer I've ever met, is that arrogant? I don't go around saying that to people, but it's what I'd answer if I was asked the appropriate question. Is that wrong? Should I instead lie and conform to a standard of blandness just so that I won't make anyone else feel bad by being better than them? I never lie to people when I say things like that. If I was to say something like that, it would mean that I believed it was the truth. Anyway, that whole type of ""don't raise yourself up, it's arrogant"" thinking just sounds like, communist, or something like that, to me.

Why am I talking about this? Well, some random guy messaged me and said ""you're so fucking cocky"" and then signed off before I could say anything. Normally I would just forget about it, but it reminded me of the last conversation that I ever had with Heather. She said I was cocky. I really don't understand how anyone could get that impression about me...I mean, have they not *met* Dan Sacco? :) Haha, I dunno. I probably shouldn't worry about it at all, but I felt the need to make an LJ post and this seemed as good a topic as any.

On a completely unrelated note, I recently discovered the music of Idlewild through Pandora. Definitely my favorite band at the moment. Kind of an R.E.M. meets Yellowcard sound. If you're interested, download ""American English"" and/or ""The Remote Part/Scottish Fiction"" by them...those are my two favorite songs right now."

I don't know where she's from, though she refers to college as ""uni"" (is that an England-only thing, or all of Europe? Not sure.) so I figure she's not from the USA. Apparently a couple months younger than me, too. I'm planning to contact her to see what mixing/editing programs she uses...the sound quality of her songs is like professional CD quality, so either she has regular access to a real recording studio or she's got some very good software. Or both.

It's completely improvised...performed on my synthesizer with an areggiated slap bass, although you really can't tell because I stick to the upper octaves for most of the piece. Don't be fooled though, I'm doing just as much work as the keyboard in this one. I actually edited the recording a bit using WavePad, and I think it's quite noticable; there's far less static and the sounds of me turning the recorder on and off are gone. For a first-time edit, quite good, if I don't say so myself.

I only did 20 because I'm lazy. Also no two songs are by the same artist. And I skipped over instrumental stuffs. Most of these should be obvious to people like <lj user=""the_last_page"">, <lj user=""thesacco"">, <lj user=""zenpickle"">, and <lj user=""hhf3"">. Guess away!

Edit: Oh right, for those of you that didn't see it on someone else's LJ, instructions a la Nuj: ""Open your music player and set it to shuffle- Write down the first line of lyrics from each of the first 25 songs that come up! Let people guess, and then underline or strike out songs as they are correctly identified!"""

"event","I think I've unknowingly been on some kind of quest to find a band, or even just a song, that every single person I know would like, with no exceptions. The closest I've come so far is with Minus the Bear and certain punks who are on ""crusades to rid the world of emo, gone awry"" are still being punks about it. I don't know why I'm doing this, really. Perhaps part of the whole anti-elitism among music majors bit. Anyway, it seems to be pretty much an impossible task. I also wish I felt motivated to do anything right now."

"event","We went and watched Fun with Dick and Jane...it was ok, Jim Carrey's solo stuff obviously being the highlight of the film. Then we went and rented a bunch of movies, watched Shaolin Soccer which was ok, and The Name of the Rose which was actually quite good. We considered watching Saw but it was 4AM and Sacco and I wanted to go to bed so we put it off until tomorrow.

Ever since I got home, I've had this strange feeling which I just can't identify. It's like there's something in the food, even though the food is better here. The things that I left unfinished refuse to leave my mind, and I feel I need to write a new song, but I can't with my family here. Maybe they will leave or something.

I got my job back at Domino's for break, and I'm 21 in a week. But I've lost the clarity that I had before."

"event","It's funny, the closer I get to the end of the semster, the more every single last thing just seems to click into place. I love it. Also, I found the following line from the school paper quite funny:

""You pulled an all-nighter last Monday to study for a test that you'll soon find out you failed. You rewarded yourself by taking Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday off. Now it's Friday. Will you spend the night studying for your next test? Of course not. You'll spend the night drowning your sorrows in alcohol, or, if you're under 21, alcohol.""

And I get to actually meet <lj user=""volly2k1""> on Saturday! Haha, good times, good times."

"event","A good day. Not a productive one, but a good one. Went to lunch with Eva and her friend, was fun. Eva made a Facebook group called ""People who like throwing skittles at people named Danny and their victims"" or something like that, so of course I had to join it. Later, I kinda sorta worked out things with Josh. But honestly, I don't think I'll ever trust him again. That kind of thing just...gets to me.

But on a positive note, umm, good stuff! Good stuff happened. Now I just need to figure out how to not fail the music history final on Saturday, and I'm set for the semester. Plus Eva and I might still be going to Boston, a further Russian consult is needed.

I want it to be break. But at the same time, I don't want to abandon Rochester just as things are getting good. :)"

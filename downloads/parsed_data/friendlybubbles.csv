   I will not make the same mistakes that you did,
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery.
I will not break the way you did you fell so hard,
I learned the hard way to never let it get that far.

   Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk.
Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I won't 
get hurt. Because of you I find it hard to trust not only
me but everyone around me.  Because of you I am afraid....

   I lose my way & its not too long before you point it out.
I cannot cry because I know thats weakness in your eyes.
I'm forced to fake a smile the life, everyday of my life.
My heart can't possibly break when it wasn't even whole

in your sleep.  I was so young you should have known
better than to lean on me. You never thought of anyone else 
you just saw your pain. And now I cry in the middle of the
night, gonna see your fear.

Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I won't

I didn't know who it was at first but as we were dancing I realized it was Rich.  I wanted to pull away b/c in my dream I was married too.  But I couldn't leave.  The next thing I know I was in bed w/ him  & we had had sex.  James walks in & we're still in bed together.  Well James gets pissed & I didn't care.  After James stormed out I woke up.  Now I feel so weird around him.  What the hell?!?  Maybe it was the interesting convo that Rich & I had lastnight.  Maybe its b/c we talked some unfinished business out lastnight.  I feel a lot better the way things ended between us now that I know why, but  I still hate the fact that we might've still been together had certain assholes hadn't interfeared.  Oh well  I love James & I can't think 'what if' & not long for what could have been.  If Rich & I were together now  Would I have Kalin?  Would I have some other baby?

"event","FRIDAY NIGHT:
    We dropped kalin off at James's parents & then hung out there for a while.  August (Lindsie's boyfriend)  had a Halo pary & James I were invited so we went to that.  We arrived there around 5pm & was one of the first ones there.  Of course it's Indiana & it snows from November to April so there was a lot of snow that I got into my shoe b/c  My shoes only some up to my ankles & of course dumb me wore ankle socks so the snow got into them too.  I spent the evening w/ my sister & her bf  & 12 other boys that all were under the age of 18.  God did I feel old! *LOL*  So after about 5 1/2 hours of this I was bored out of my mind &  it smelled in the basement, I talked James into leaving & going back to our house ofr a quickie.  Since Kalin wasn't there it really wasn't a quickie (Thank God!).  Afterwards we headed back to James's parents, in Valories car, b/c ours didn't have gas.  We got there, Kalin was asleep so we went to be for the night.

SATURDAY:
    We get up & I took a shower.  After we got Kalin around & waited for James's aunts to arrive  & left for Indy around 11:30am.  We get to Marion & decide we're hungary (Valorie, James, & I)  So we stopped at Arby's (yum!).  James's Dad, Aunts, & uncle were in one car us in another, well they kept on going after we stopped so we didn't care.  After eating we joked about changing Kalin & then she peed on James so we really DID need to change her.  So after changing we get back on the road & spend the other 1 1/2 hours on the road.  Finally we get to James's Grandma Ware's house & his dad has beaten us there (big surprise).  WE hang out for a few minutes & his parents play dominoes, James plays the DS & Kalin & I found other things to do.  Finally, after several hours, we eat & watch Kalin devour a whole pickle.  After eating we sat down & I got Kalin to finally sleep after being awake all day.  So we watch Madagascar  & leave to James's Grandpa Gibson's house.  We get there around 9pm  & are awkae until midnight when we FINALLY get Kalin to bed.  After spending the night on a full size bed w/ a baby taking over the whole thin I got SOME sleep.

SUNDAY:
    We have a wonderful breakfast & wait to hear from other Family members to see when they might show up.  After waiting a few hours they make it before their parents do & we hang out until lunch time.  We have the typical Christmas dinner of ham & shit like that.  Then open gifts & gift cards from family members.  Kalin got 3 stuffed toys, 2 made noise, & 2 baby gates.  I got $50 gift cards to Best Buy  & a $10 to Meijer.  All in all it was a good day.  We left around 3pm &  I fell asleep before we got onto any major highway  & wake up to us pulling in the drive so I didn't have to sit there bored throughout the whole ride home.  We get to his parents & then we went shopping at Best Buy.  We Came home & now I get the whole evening to myself."

11-16-05
   Well that settles it!  I guess James isn't attracted to me anymore.  Why else would he almost completely ignore me most of the day when Angie was here & be loving & caring towards me before hand?  Maybe all of the times we've fucked, I can't call it any better, this week was b/c of Angie being in the house.  Its always been when he knew she was on her way or after she left the house.  Why else would he bitch about me wanting to make-out w/ him other than the reason of not wanting me?  Am I that ugly?  Or that fat?  Maybe if I changed how I looked he'd want me again.  I can't even remember the last time we ""made love"".  Obviously it's just been a way for him to cum & be on his way.  Am I that bad looking that he just needs to use me, his wife, so he can relieve some ""tension""?  What the fuck does he need to be tense about?!?  Maybe a life of ""fuck what everyone else wants"" is hard.  How bad can get to work, eat, sleep, jerk off, play videogames be?  Yeah he helps w/ Kalin but not until I ask him to.  For once I want to know I'm truly loved & not just some fuck toy who is just a cunt to stick a dick into& occasionally feeds him.  Maybe thats all I really am.  Some stupid cunt for him to fuck.  Maybe I should start acting like it.

Well James being the nosy person he is read this entry & confronted me about it a few hours later, he read it & went to bed.  He appologized & told me that he truly did love me & hoped that I wouldn't write such nasty things about him in the future.  To which I told him as long as he wasn't being an ass I wouldn't! LOL"

For the past week  I have felt like the intruder in his life, like I'm not supposed to be here or that I'm ruining his plans.  Sometimes I wonder if he's even attracted to me at all.  Maybe he's only w/ me b/c we had a child together.  Maybe he regrets ever marrying me b/c I was pregnant.  What if he only married me b/c of that?  If I hadn't miscarried would we be happier today?   If I hadn't gotten pregnant in the first place would we still be together today?  We've attempted to 'make love' twice in 10 days which is less than last week.  It's getting to be more & more time in between each time.  I'm starting to feel less & less attractive to him or anyone.  Am I that bad to be with???  I try to be happy, I really do.  All day he's been distant.  He doesn't want to talk to me & when he does it's snippy.  He's acting like I did something & I have no clue as to what I did.  Maybe he's finding attraction else where?  He says it's the house business but I don't believe him.  He would've been like this months ago if that were true.  God what do I do???  He's not giving me answers & I don't know why.

Any man who wants to pork a stick can go ahead I don't know what's so damn good about it considering they're the ones who fuck anything to make them feel attractive.  Women w/ asses & tits scare their tiny dicks into hiding in being intimidated.  Personally if i were a guy I'd rather fuck a bed considering it has more give than a skinny bitch.  My husband agrees w/ me on this!  I may not be skinny but I'm not fat either so I have EVERY RIGHT to BITCH about fucki'n skinny ass skanks.  You can be just as healthy if not more weighing 170 lbs as you can at 100.  To all the bitches who think they're fat & weigh only 50 lbs & over the age 17 can suck my left nut.

He doesn't believe me but you can tell by the way a girl or guy talks if they are interested in you.  Well she is in him!  We've seen her maybe 3 times, the first time was brief, as in we were checking out houses.  We saw her several weeks later & she asks James if he got his job at Kitty Hawk yet.  WHAT THE HELL?!?  Who remembers that after one hour of being in the same place?  I wouldn't unless I was interested.  She then calls MY cell phone looking for James & sounding surprised when I answered the phone.  She didn't even introduce herself or her business she just wanted to talk to James.  And the only reason for that was if she was going to see him sometime this week, then asked him what his girlfriend's name was ,me.  Personally if asked that I would have said 'my HUSBAND'S name is James,' he just told her my name & left it at that. *GRRRRRRR*  So we go & apply last night & everything is fine.  When we get home we put Kalin to bed & start something well half way through Kalin wakes up.  It takes me 15 minutes to get her back to sleep, by that time James has lost the mood & would rather handle things himself.  Stress reliever he says.  Doesn't seem like it to me!

Valorie invited me to go to a Scrapbook party with her tomorrow I might go if I feel better b/c I'll have to take Kalin w/ me so James can sleep.  I hope I can nap after going to the bank today!"

"event","Yeah well James has 2 jobs now & I only get to see him for about 3 hours total during the day.  He also only gets to spend about 1 1/2 w/ Kalin so that leaves 22 1/2 hrs that I have no break from the baby.  I NEED SLEEP!!!!!! *LOL* I love you Kalin!"

"event","Well James & I had a good talk & worked everything out hopefully this weekend he'll do better!  Tuesday we went to Wells Fargo about a home loan from the VA (Veterans Affairs) & the house we'd like to get, since it's in our price range is a trailer but the VA wont fund the money to a place w/ no real property.  So we're still looking into getting it just w/ a personal loan.  Maybe use the VA loan later on in life if we need to.  Adam, Angie, & Andrew are also going to live w/ us.  The trailer is big enough (3bdrms, 2 bath) so we don't have to worry about that & rent is only $699/mo. so split it 4 ways & you have $175 a month!  In other news the only reality t.v. show I actually liked (rockstar: INXS) got rid of my fave person(Jordis) a few weeks ago so I stopped watching.  So the one person I didn't like (J.D.) got it.  Grrr.....!!!! Oh well!"

"event","It figures I write something nice about my husband & he turns around & mkaes a liar out of me.  I don't think I could have married a more selfish asshole in my whole life!  All I as on Saturday & Sunday is that I get those nights to sleep w/o worrying about the baby.  Do I get them? HELL NO!!  He's more worried about his precious computer game than me or his daughter.  It's also an inconvenience to have him get up to see why she's crying or awake.  I think if he says anything to me today I'm taking Kalin & we're going to go away for awhile that way the selfish ass can get his own damn way."

"event","Sometimes I wonder how I could love a man so much & the next I wonder why.  James is my whole world  I don't think I could ever love another human being as much as I love him.  But there are times in our relationship that I wonder what made me love him in the first place.  We argue about anything but make up just as easily as we had gotten into the argument.  I can want to strangle him one minute & kiss him the next.  I can't see myself w/o him later on in life.  He's my whole world I know if he died I'd die of a broken heart but there are times, when I'm VERY MAD at him that I wonder what it'd be like to marry someone else.  He makes me feel like the most beautiful woman on this planet & lets me know that I'm loved deeply.  He also can push my buttons just right that I threaten to leave, he knows if I ever got mad enough that I would.  I just don't know how I'd survive w/o him if I did.  Sometimes when I look at him, I have the most overwhelming feeling of love that I can't express it.  Even now it's hard to say.  I love you James."

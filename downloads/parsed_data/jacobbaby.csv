Well I am getting ready for the Christmas Season for business to get started at least that way I will be so busy I wont have time for much else than to make money. I just decided to make myself a lifeong purchase and thats a purchase of a house. So during the month of September I will be moving out of this tiny apartment and into the new house. The house needs quite a bit of work but at least when I do something for it then it will be doing it for something I own instead of making repairs on a place I'll never own in a million years. Besides I am getting it for a steal because of it being so far out in the country it needs sunlight piped into it. I am getting it for only $3,000.00 fully furnished from my Parents. Its the house that my Great Grandmother had while she was living. It is livable just needs the porches redone and one piece of water pipe for the hotwater to function and I think that won't be such a bad job. I wont have to pay for Water there because it has its own Well and Pump that pumps the water into the house so I will have water that is chemical free. I bet many people would kill for an offer like this.......Its so far away from others I can even play in my sandbox in nothing but my diapers I just have to be careful and not get sand in the diaper because that might just hurt a bit ;-)"

"event","<B><H4>Well before you apply to become one of my friends let me first describe what this Journal is about. I am an adult baby. If you don't know what this is then you probably wont find anything here you are interested in. But just in case let me explain what an adult baby is.
<H4><LI>An Adult baby is an adult that desires being treated as if he or she was a real life baby.
<H4><LI>An Adult baby does not include real children in their quest. They don't desire sexual interaction with a real child but instead they wish to be a child.
<H4><LI>Adult babies are very emotional at times and are easily hurt <I>Therefore if you are looking to be my friend to hurt my feelings then you are not welcome</I>

<H1>Due to some aggrivations my journal became friends only If you wish to become my friend then please post here"

'Help, help, ' said a man. 'I'm drowning.'
'Hang on, ' said a man from the shore.
'Help, help, ' said the man. 'I'm not clowning.'
'Yes, I know, I heard you before.
Be patient dear man who is drowning,
You, see I've got a disease.
I'm waiting for a Doctor J. Browning.
So do be patient please.'
'How long, ' said the man who was drowning. 'Will it take for the Doc to arrive? '
'Not very long, ' said the man with the disease. 'Till then try staying alive.'
'Very well, ' said the man who was drowning. 'I'll try and stay afloat.
By reciting the poems of Browning
And other things he wrote.'
'Help, help, ' said the man with the disease, 'I suddenly feel quite ill.'
'Keep calm.' said the man who was drowning, ' Breathe deeply and lie quite still.'
'Oh dear, ' said the man with the awful disease. 'I think I'm going to die.'
'Farewell, ' said the man who was drowning.
Said the man with the disease, 'goodbye.'
So the man who was drowning, drownded
And the man with the disease past away.
But apart from that,
And a fire in my flat,
It's been a very nice day.

"event","Whenever life gets you down, Mrs. Brown,
And things seem hard or tough,
And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft,
And you feel that you've had quite eno-o-o-o-o-ough,

Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
And revolving at nine hundred miles* an hour.
It's orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned,
The sun that is the source of all our power.
Now the sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see,
Are moving at a million miles a day,
In the outer spiral arm, at fourteen thousand miles an hour,
Of a galaxy we call the Milky Way.

Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars;
It's a hundred thousand light-years side to side;
It bulges in the middle sixteen thousand light-years thick,
But out by us it's just three thousand light-years wide.
We're thirty thousand light-years from Galactic Central Point,
We go 'round every two hundred million years;
And our galaxy itself is one of millions of billions
In this amazing and expanding universe.

Our universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding,
In all of the directions it can whiz;
As fast as it can go, that's the speed of light, you know,
Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is.
So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure,
How amazingly unlikely is your birth;
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere out in space,



* As pointed out to me by Dr. Chu of the Astronomy Department at the U. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, this value isn't quite right. She's correct: the earth is revolving at approximately 1030 miles per hour at its equator, and at 900 miles per hour only at a latitude of ~29 degrees (north or south). The closer you get to either pole, the less distance the earth needs to spin to complete one revolution, and so the slower it rotates. 

Hmm, I wonder if the other numbers are any more accurate..."

"event","summer holidays! three weeks in and i've only just bothered to update.  shocking!  in fact, i dont think i've updated since the beginning of june. a few gatherings at frasers which were, of course, great fun.  fraser and i attempted to finish a game of monopoly but failed once again!  had a good night at chris' too and thats about all i can rememebr. i'll see how far i get into the summer before boring myself and you!

june - the end of school was alright, sixth year! scary stuff.  i have to admit i got slightly bored of the 6th form centre pretty quickly but i found other things to do about the school, crosswords with lou and mr. gwynne for example.... hehe.  infact, if i'm going to do a full update i'm going to skip the end of term.  

so, the holidays, the day we broke up from school after prizegiving beave had louise and i round to help him cook dinner for ourselves, beav's mum, david, bridget and charlii.  we made curry which was awesome.  it was pouring when louise and i walked round though and we got absolutely soaked! i'll post some pictures at some point.

1st july - flew to france, and met cat and dad in lyon airport.  we went to the peking opera which was interesting if not eccentric... the constumes and gymnastics were fantastic but i was not so takin in my the singing. we went to the chartrese (dont know how to spell that) mountains and did a bit of walking around tehre. in was here that dad was crowned ""The BIG Potato"" (or the mistranslated ""grande pom"") and alison ""the BIG Sandwich"" we then headed to annecy which was really cool to see beacsue i  have been once before with louise in february so it was fun to see it in the sunshine instead of snow.  its a really pretty place with a canal running right through the town.  we ate lots and saw lots. went on a lovely boat trip on lake annecy in the perfect sun.  drove to geneva tol drop off debbie before driving up to somewhere i cant remember the name of but it was a pretty place with a drunk man peeing on a lamppost.
before returning to britain we saw the canadian war memorial and we saw the trenches at vimy ridge with was really cool to see because i've leart all about it in history and other things so was great to actually seet he place with teh restored trenches and tunnels.  also went to the museum about azincourt (i think)  the war that took place between henry V and the french. (i think)  on october the 25th,  1415. (i think)

back in britain we had a quick stop in chertsey to see pop pop and drop off ali and then cat and i had a few nights in bristol.  we went power kite flying which was so difficult! my muscles ached for days after but it was so much fun!
 back to glasgow on the 10th and spent the night at tom's. was good to see him!  left early on the monday morning though cos he was working and i had to go get ready for my music course.

the music course this year was good. i was an assistant and so had the right to the staffroom amongst other things.  many funny memories (that i remember with an 'eek')  and the music was good. i was plaing in the windband with jordan and 6 other trumpets.  we played the music from les mis which was awesome.  the brass group played Mr. Jums from Three Brass Cats which was really good. Graeme played teh solo and it sounded fantastic.  the orchestra were amazing too. it was the 20th anniversary of the Sscot course and so Robin Wedderburn composed a symphony for the occasion.  it was really good and i think it was a realy honour for mark to conduct and for us to listen to the premier.  ropbin was very happy to play in it too.
Chang ho was invited back to play the solo in teh Lalo concerto which, again, was amazing. he's a fantastic violinist and he was an even better performer.  well done!
i dont think  i have ever sung so much in my life- the staff room was always alive with the sound of music and pretty frequently alive with the sound of dodgy jokes.  renditionis of 'my eyes are dim' and 'singing in the rain' shall not be forgotten!  micheal and i held our legs in teh air for 1hr  22 mins which was quite a challenge but flipping impressive!  lots more i could write but i cannot be bothered right now!

this week i've bene in arran with beav and the flemmings.  tom and charli were tehre also and jenny tait and jenni elliot with charlotte.  we had a good time.  tom, charli beave and i spent the first night in a tent which was very windy but i quite liked it. it was exciting! went swimming in the river and then in the sea, ate four breakfasts in one day, had a big bonfire, games of cards, slept. it was great fun. i shall post some photos when i get myself organised!

anyway, so i'm home now for a while and shall maybe get bored and update more!

thats all folks!

so long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, adieu!
 smile!

"event","i would like to take some time to reflect on the past few weeks.

two weeks ago today i was sitting thinking ""two weeks today and it will all be over, all my attempts to express all my knowledge from teh past year will have been made, the climax of school exams reached leading to the hopefully gradual fall."" (maybe i did not think those precise words but somehting to that effect.)

so now, two weeks on i would like to comment on the fact that i have now sat the all important exams and although i feel i maybe did not do them all justice i have had an awesome school year so am not complaining. (i might be in august but i only have myself to blame and i'l get over it)


but as it is the night that ends it all i feel i should not be spending my time on the internet.  however everyone else has exams so i cannot distract them.  tom has just left.   had a massive mix up about meeting arrangements earlier, got me quite frustrated as i walked out to anniesland to meet him but then had to get back for babysitting.  he, meanwhile, was waiting outside my house.  he didnt have his phone and he had origionally text me from his mothers phone so i text her back and she was wondering what had happened to tom cos she'd left him at my house so was all very confusing. i called beave cos i assumed he's be the first person tom would go to when lost in teh west end(i was right) but he didnt answer his phone. anyway, to cut a long story short (er),   eventually, almost 2 hours after we were meant to meet we caught up.  he just rang the door at babysitting and got the kids kinda confused. but all turned out well and i had an awesome night with him.  im in such a good mood! :D  


also, look wat i found!

"event","Hello all you people of the world.  Enjoying the nice weather today, hope you all are as well. Think i might take the boat out later.  good day for a sail. was down at kelvinside academy's playin fields this afternoon. Went to practice my handstanding skills.  Sus was really impressive. she was standing on her hands, her head, flippin all  over the place..uh oh i just dropped my caramel freddo!!! so anyway we were messing about on the crash mats and then got chased away.  two men and a digger were chasing us around and around the field.  We escaped through a hole in the bushes. I was really quite emotional about it as i had left behind my little troll friend.  His name is eric. Hes really nice once you get to kbnow him and his ways. 
 Forgot to tell you about what hapened before we lost eric.  We were walkin up and out of the lane when a car pulled up. Sus and I were going up to SPAR to send our bi-monthly newsletterz to the friends n family. (If you dont receive a newsletter then you know i dont consider you to be a member of my family or one of my friends!) So as i was sayin, behind the wheel of the car was who we now know to be SI, he introduced himself with a shower of saliva and questioned what we were doing.  WE informed Si that we were sending out our newsletters and he continued to tell us about his life, where he grew up and his friend names Steve who had a family who were all sleepin together, and only could tell Tom, the second/half brother of steve about it all by newsletter. Found out he was delivering magazines.  He also told us that he really should do the same. He asked where we lived between dribbles and commented on the house being cute. we made our excuse and went on our way.  Turns out the guy thinks we're lesbians, forced his way into my house and left us a not...""Girls, If you want to deliver in this area we have 240 mags going out bi-monthly.  call me if you do! Simon""  so we emailed him to get more info

booked a table for saturday night, to celebrate the death of eric!!!  


love always...SMILE


P.S i just want to say a quick note to Sus if she reads this.  I really value our friendship and want to say how much i admire her.  I look up to her in so many ways and i know that i can always count on her if i need her.  For laughs or tears, smiles or frowns, stealing or eating, shes always there.    


LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART SUS!!! YOU ARE MY LIFE  xxxxxx

"event","Some people live life like the sun, with everyone revolving around them.  These people are fiery, exciting and yet though spectacular from a distance they are difficult to get close to.  no-one wants to go near them really, yet people live by them, rely on them, and feed on what they provide.  The ""sun people"" centre themselves and think themselves the most important thing in everyone else's life, providing energy to others and being the one source of all things, the one most powerful object in a life.  There is the inevitable rising of the sun, sometimes people have dark moments but they will rise again and routinely shine, get glory.  these are the pretty people, people who seek power and long for attention.  They look great from here, but i warn you, be careful.  With these people i advise that you keep your distance, and wear sunglasses so you can see them more clearly.  no matter how much time you enjoy spending with the sun, keep applying protective suncream.  you do not want this sun destroying parts of your life.  don't let it corrupt your life with cancers and sun burn.  never let the sun catch you crying.

""A poem for Duncan - my dead Budgie""


I don't think anyone can understand, 
The love I felt for my little man 

He had to have been sent from above, 
My birdie with such unconditional love 

He asked for nothing but my time, 
Maybe to sing him a song,teach him a rhyme 

He brought me such happiness and bliss, 
I know there is so many things I'll miss 



The gentle way he preened my ear, 
How he got so excited just to have me near 

His sweet low song that woke me each day, 
All the words that he could say 

Feeding him his apple and pear, 
How he liked to snuggle under my hair 

How he said ""mommys little guy"", 
How much he enjoyed just one lullaby 

Why did he leave I wish I knew, 
Maybe God just needed someone to talk to 

I know he's gone but we'll never be apart, 
I'll always have him in my heart 

And no matter where I go I know he'll be there, 
Because now baby birdie can fly anywhere. 

(just to clarify, Duncan was not my budie, and i do not miss him. i also hope that wherever i go Duncan shall not be there.)"

"event","Good evening.  on teh internet to find out the dates of all of my exmas. they are quite well spaced and are all over by the 24th which coincides with ali's last exam on teh 27th so shall go down to the caslt of new to celebrate. more likely think over how much time i wasted throughout the year updating a journal that noone reads when i could have been studying and giving myself a chance of doing well in my highers. but thats life. no regrets as my dear friend robbie tells me frequently.  i hear him say - ""no regrets, tehy dont work. no regrets now. they only hurt"".  

had a good holiday so far. done a bit of studying when ali allows it, which is not often. but when she sleeps in a get a good few hours done in the morning.  and when she rises i get a bad few hours in.  oh, after my last update i only just caught my train.  silly questionaire that i foolishly answered.  hehe.
but i got the train after leaping of the bus, racing to central and skidding onto the platform.  tom and his father met me at Lanark station and we went back to tom's.  we went to see ruari and when teh rain stopped hammering on the window, the sun came out and we went back to his house to watch a dvd.  was a good day. they took me out for dinner which was unexpected and slightly embarrasing. but i'm sure it shall be an occasion which i look back on with laughter and a slight cringe...was good fn though. home pretty late but after a check up call from andrew on behalf of my sister i got escorted home by a very protective older sister.  how nice of her!

yesterday ali and i meant to work in teh morning but i didn't. i watched the OC. first time i've ever really watched it. i kinda saw it the other day but didnt pay attention.  sure its really good but i didnt really follow any of the story lines. 
ali surfaced late and we went into town to book my train ticket for york and to get her shoes. we went to crepe a croissant on byres road first for lunch. was good! walked into town and i found a pair of shoes and a skirt and a top, so was pretty succesful! hehe. not been shopping in ages though so i justified spending money. 

went round to charlii's when i got home and had a good walk with her and katie. its always really relazing talking to charlii cos we can tlak about any random crap and it makes a good conversation. we can also talk about meaningful stuff which is made lighthearted. i like it!  
may i add to charlii's words about Sandy, i hope you get better soon! sending my love!

shopping again today, with mothers money. got trainers and a pair of jeans. bid ali farewell as she left for penrith. mum and i went for a good walk. she wants to come running with me as long as we start slowly so that should be good. 

i need to get fit quickly and do this by running a lot more frequently. got to run to bearsden at some point. lol.
anyway. home and away time! hehe
speak later
smile

"event","quick update, been dossing about the house all day having a complete clear out of all the stuff in my room. only half way through though so it looks a complete state.  its such a nice day outside though so ali and i are going to go for a walk.  on holiday now for 2 weeks. holiday was needed. 
not much been happening.

went up to glencoe last weekend for easter. was a laugh and a half.  ali and i did lots of walking and wandering.  out for lunch on sunday with the family. was nice.

monday, i met the mr gwynne, rhe rector and co in glencoe to go up ben nevis.  was shattered and with only a few hiccups managed to get to the top.  had no view from the top but was good anyway. i'd never been up nevis before.  oh, we all licked a slug.  that was fun. it dries your mouth so you cant chew.  clever.

school this week was fairly uneventful i think...had a big universtiy fair on tur night. was slightly boring. useless too, if you want to go to uni in england.

got reports yesterday.  was better than i expected!  anyway. im off for my walk.
speak sometime.

"event","well, been ages since i last updated-in fact, last update i was not quite myself. i was in fact my sister. impossible it may sound but so close am i mentally to her that we fuse- perhaps by inducement of an electric current (somatic fusion?) that we think and act as one.  caring, sharing, every little thing that we are wearing. two different faces but in tight places we think and act like one........

anyway, onto wat i've been up to. just back form the glasgow music festival.  i worked out (tough though it was) that i have been competing in it for 10 years now.  how incredibly sad!  but it was cool.  all of the stewards/stewarddesses know me and chat to me.  this familiarity was aided by my assistance last year with the stewarding.  all the otehrs must be over 70 and there i was, bright and brisk at 15!  hehe.

anyway, also got wosis going on this weekend.  good to see lots of people i havn't seen for ages despite teh trumpet family falling to pieces!  peter has left me to join the jazz band and iaian(though i knew it before) is still being a traitor and joining teh bass guitars. loser! hehehe.
but its good fun all the same.

this time last week i was in a snowhole!!!!hehe. with mr gwynne-what a guy! and af ew otehrs form school. i was such an amazing weekend! i loved it. we walked up to a suitable corrie and spent hours digging our snowholes to sleep in! was great fun! right, gota go phone someone

"event","last day of january, has been an month full of events. and now, at the end, i am left, as a memory of it, with a bruised nose and knee and a letter form my dear other me... salutations to you also, and i know that you shall get this message as you ahve nothing better to do with your life than invade my journal. but i love you all the same.
prelim are over tomorrow, have biology left and then i have teh dreaded results looming.  i'm not joking, i don't think i could have done worse in maths or phyiscs.  they were dreadful. with phyiscs the most annoying thing was i know it wasn't allt hat difficult, i mean i remember seeing questions and doing questions similar to it, but i just couldn't think in teh exam. oh well, its over now and i think mr brunton already knew i was going to do badly.  he smiled when i told him i failed. hehe.  
anyway, to be completely truthful, i'm not all that bothered about the prelims, much more exciting things on my mind. such as the winter skills weekend with mr gwynne!!! 

hehe, it was fantastic! i loved it.  all of it.  we set off at about 5ish on friday evening and the 8 pupils, mr gwynne and olivier drove to newtonmore where we were staying.

louise and i were the only girls so we had out double room and the six guys next door.  dinner on the first night, potato wedges, sausages(haggis sausaged i'd like to add) and beans. was a true, delicious, stodgy dinner, cooked by our fine selves.....you know what, i'm not in the mood to type so may update later, then again, may not.  ok, hehe, speak later!

"event","and i'm back.  and ""high as a kite"".  hehehehe. i'm currently sitting cross legged in teh big computer chair, my hair off my face with the aid of a putple hair band and simon lying on my sisters bed. how eeeriee? 
ali and i caught up with each other this morning on the phone. filled each other in on all teh gossip and established some new, deep, meaningful stuff, of which i have entirely dismissed from my thoughts.
also received a letter from Cat today, was a lovely letter, no change tehre. so heart warming and sensitive. i love receiving her letters, but i can't help but laugh. i guess its nervous laughter cos i'm not use to all teh emotions etc. hearless chicken that i am.  but i appreciate it ever so very much, thanking you oh so kindly, and i shall reply.

was babysitting last night. tom came over beforehand and i cooked him dinner, was good. well, i thought so. then we went ventured along to the land of the hynd and sat on babies for 5 hours or soemthing. was good fun. we played pool (i wasn't too successful), tom found grand theft auto, watched shrek 2 and had a good time. i thank him kindly for accompanying me.  

friday night, i went for dinner with fraser and charlotte. was so good, had a laugh and a half. in fact i dont remember not laughing at all during the night. quizzed fraser on many things. ate lots and didn't get spat on thanks to advice given by mrs. wright and received by ourselves.  

friday at school, or rather after school, i spoke at gavel.  had my speech written about childrens' poetry, inspired by neil (thank you). felt silly but wasn't as bad as it could have been.tom helped quite a bit, thank you too.

thursday at school, i fainted, hehee. appology to heather for finding me.  was sent home as a result so naturally went to susan's.  not much else been oging on that i can remember


day etched in my memory-the 7th of Jan, the day my love left me. for another? i do not know.  but my love, how i miss thee... since your departure i have but cried. my mind is fixed with thought of you and the many hours we spent together, laughing, being chickens, nose kissing... and the many other joyous minutes we shared.  i love you eternally. my al. forever in my heart.""wishing you were somehow here again""

anyway, now it is time to depart.  
so long, fare well and all that"

once again i have not updated for a reasonably lengthy time and therefore have too much to write, so shall abbreviate and severely shorten my memories, for your sakes.

2nd of january, had charlii's anual 2nd of january party.  shall nto be forgotten. the curry, and random martin (i know he's not random to you charlotte, but to me, he shall remain as random martin) talking constantly.  the talk of unheavenly objects, which poppy apparently had a vast knowledge on.

lorna charlotte and i went down to chris' after dinner and jack came round.  people paired off and when five people are present, pairing leaves one out.  and that one, quite happily, was me.  so chris and charlotte were together, jack and lorna, so shona slept.  thats unusual, eh?! 
mornign of the 3rd, i dropped my phone in orange juice. 
evening of the 3rd i had a ""lord of the rings night"" with neil, but ended up watching mean girls.  had a heart to heart about my emotionlessness.  if that makes sense?  and it wasn't really about that, but got me thinking about that.  all interesting!
cannot really remember much else of the holiday. ali and i bonded for a change.  we went out for dinner on the tuesday i think, to the bothy.  which was greeeeeat.  always fond of my food.  anyway, dad's just made me a bacon roll.. so shall write more later, possibly.
farewell

"event","All my bags are packed, i'm ready to go. i'm standing here outside you're door. i hate to wake you up to say goodbye...  but the dawn is breaking its early morn. taxi's waiting he's blowing his horn. already i'm so lonesome i could cry. so kiss me and smile for me, tell me that you'll wait for me. hold me like you'll never let me go.

afternoon. well, the year is drawing increasingly swiflty to a close and my plans for this evening have been struck with a lit match, but fortunately only slightly singed.  The night shall hopefully still hold many laughs, smiles and much enjoyment but unfortunately there will be someone missing from my plans. Mr David, i shall miss you sincerely, but as i think about the night to come, and the saddness your absense poses, i remind myself how comical the situation really is. The boy is the best, i love him, but he's a muppet.  Drunk, not disorderly - or so we thought.  i have to admit i didn't see all that much of his last night at Fraser's, but what i did see of him was polite, friendly and unlike the agressive drunk who noisily polluted our company at the last gathering.  Loeverly boy, who received love advice from Mrs. Wright, got told how to ""get those slippers under the table... as they say!""  anyway, jamie got home and made a mess of his face and so cannot come out tonight. LOSER.  so i shall be going to ellie's alone. but as i said, this occurence is only singeing my night, it shall be great! i love ellie, i love her family and shall, of course, request my dance with her grandmother.  in fact, it was ellie and her family who first introduced me to the seducting world of intoxication by alcoholic beverages.  i think they have it on camera, my first drunken stumblings.  like learning to walk... its opened the door to an entire inviting, yet slightly intimidating, world.

i visited this world last night.  travelling reluctently at first, but not arguing when the ginger boy leading my into the expanse allowed me to sleep.  what a party animal eh?!  arriving at fraser's i was drinkin purely coke and water.  but things changed and instead of getting me hyper,  the alcohol fairy led me to the tranquilising land of nod, the world where everything was serene and nothing could be more perfect than lying in the arms of someone showing affection.  so thats what i did.  all night. deprived tom of the food on offer, the excitment next door and just slept in his arms.  was a good night.  beave was a little worse for wear, and speaking of beav, thanks for the hoodie. wearing it at the moment actually!

anyway, i have sufficienly depreved myself of study enough today and should cut the restraining rope and sit down, enjoy and relish every moment with my books.  so there you have it. study.

but before i leave, may i wish you all the very best for the evening and i wish you all a very joyful and succesful new year, when it arrives.  with love, i depart.

"event","indeed it was and a random one at that.  with no father gracing our company, joe here and random south african it was, indeed, a christmas to remember.  but i'l get to that in a minute...

this past week has been a really good one!  on monday i cant remember doing much.  remember babysitting for the Walsh's which wasnt too bad cos big al came round- climbed over the roof, hehe.  quite a late night but got up on tuesday and went to meet maria and niki in bearsden to give them b'day presents.  hope you liked them guys! we went to cafe creme for lunch which was really nice and then niki took us back to her house to give us free cookies, courtesy of the power cut - yey!! thanks graham... met alan on the auto bus on the way home and went home to laze ablout before babysitiing again. [ali was working all week so really had a pretty boring week so all this chat is bad coz ali was away.](ali wrote that) 

wednesday-went christmas shopping with graham and it was the best.  usually when i go shopping it takes me ages to find things but we both got everything we needed!even lighter fluid for my blowtorch....hehehe.. i love it! that was mums xmas present.  we went for coffee and sat in at the window in the new starbucks on buchanan st. that place is teh best, saw so many people from the window!  had a white choc mocha, i recommend it.  also spent a record breaking time drinking one cup of coffee...a out 17 hours?  went to meet jamie d at 4 and he embarrased me when we first met him.  anyway...thanks for that jamie.  we also went for coffee! and it was great.  we've not had a proper conversation for ages!  was great to catch up with him and now we're (hopefully) spending new year together!   babysitting again on wed night which was good fun! the boys were all hyper so twas a laugh.

thursday! hehe! what a day?!?!  a true all singing, all dancing, laugh-a-minute day.... man, that sounded cool....i think not! but the day was immense! lou and i were having a ""dinner party"" so spent the day cooking and preparing for the evening.  was a great meal and a really fun night.  we were cooking for lou's parents, susannah, katrina, beav and tom and made portuguese chicken for main meal, melon (served very elegantly) for starter and ""iced choc moose"" for desert, only it didnt freeze so we had it as a chocolate sauce instead.  was a good dinner with funny comments emerging from susannah....hehe.  we retired to the living room afterwards to play some ""family"" games or charades and whos in the bag.  oh teh entertainment. it felt so christmassy and nice! i had a really good night.

Christmas eve... got back from louise's after running (and missing) my train.  it was snowing and sleeting so was absolutely frozen by the time i got home.  cat was home- not seen her since africa so was fun...for a while... hehe. no, was good to see her again.  spent the day clearing and organising for out christmas eve drinks ""do"".  also went to byres road with ali in the most embarrasing clothes and managed to bump into the rector, alan and jen and one of the fabiens. i was suitably embarrased!we had our drinks do and i went out with ali and cat to bar oz.  met graham before had and we went together.  was a crazy ngiht with the whole of the academy of past and present there.  got slightly inebriated and did something i probably shouldn't have done but it was christmas eve and i guess its not all that bad... i hope.anyway, left bar oz at bout 11.20 and ran to hyndland to meet beav to go to church.  pretty sinful, i know, turning up to church under the influence of alcohol but i was just giggly by that point so twas not too bad. 
catriona and simon, despite leaving before me, arrived in church after me and ali, even later.  ali was wasted and kept making me laugh.  poor beav had to put up with us both and cat shouting at us to shut up.. oopsie...  anyway, walked home and we were given our stockings but i refused to open mine.... funny for me and ali but noone else.  fell asleep watching muppets... become a bit of a habit with ali in the room, better not get hooked.  woke up bout 10 ish on smas morn and went to church again.  was good fun and sang lots.  we opened presents wen we got back and ali, having purchased a digital camera, spent the rest of teh day taking pictures and making demonstration videos on how to work things such as mums BLOW TORCH.  hehe.  we lit the candles with it and the christmas pudding, its the best!i love it!
christmas dinner was, not surprisingly, immense.  always is.  gives me such a warm feeling! hehe. and mum almost forgot the cranberries!!! ""you mean you forgot cranberries too?""

ali and i fell asleep on the sofa before waking up and me departing for the eve to go to susan's for our traditional christmas sleepover.  was good and got into pj's  etc.  thalia and james were round for a bit and alan and beave joined us for the majority of the eve.  i was really hyper for some reason, was beast!  i slept out on the landing, hehe. was comical.  up this morning and home for a shower before meeting graham so he could spend his money. i spent the day as a coathanger but was good fun.. we went for coffee and to the cinema.  saw the incredibles, was so good!  i loved it!  we walked home, well, i walked home and grahan walked as far as i did then jumped on a bus.  was a good day.  oh, and we managed to scaff kids tickets... hehe
anyway, long update!
love it!
merry chirstmas
god bless us, every one!

love you!

"event","saturday night FRANZ FERDINAND concert.  was class! was so gooood!  went with dearest charlotte and her bro and cousin. teh first support band, the kaiser chiefs i think they were called, were really good! we were right up the front too which added to the atmosphere.  teh other support band, fire engines, were actual turn, they couldn't have been worse! they were embarrasingly bad.   we stayed at teh front for the first few songs of franz  but moved back cos jamie was getting squashed.  was just as good further back.  had james on my back and jamie, until he told me he was scared of hights.  was great! went back to charlii's and visited a party round the corner, saw lots of ppl from high school, met tom k's girlfriends, she's absolutely stunning!  went home to decorate charlii's tree....hehe.

"event","good morning...afternoon rather...  been up since 7.30 as i'm still sharing a room with albal and she woke me up flipping early as she ventured forth to maryhill to go to work with mother.  

not updated for a while, in fact, my last update was not me writing but my oh so cool sister.   so yeah, had a good time at my party, school show went really well, enjoyed that.  the last week of school was good too.  saw mrs speculand on tuesday and she had my mark for my public speaking diploma, got 98% so was pretty chuffed! still have to get teh criticism etc... but got distinction and can now be addressed as ""Shona Ambrose AVCM"".  hehe....  babysitting on tuesday evening, jack was exce[tionally hyper and being pretty annoying but i cant get angry at him! he has the ginger charm.  he is so incredibly sweet, a little mischiefous guy, so even when he's being irritating he has a cheeky smile and i cant help but laugh.  

wednesday evening i went to see ""The Winters Tale""  performed by kelvinside.  it was really good, i enjoyed it!  was pretty long and was sitting beside poppy who was clueless as to what was going on but it was good.  saw ellie, hannah, leah, lorna, abbey and others, added bonus!  also spoke to emma broad and her parents! hehe, they are such a sweet family.  got a card from sleeze boy who later told everyone we were going out.  not a pleasant thought.

thursday at school was good. short and sweet.  our secret santa crew exchanged presents.  i'm not opening any presents until CHristmas day but thank you liz!   Jeni gave my Christmas/birthday present with a poem to read as i opened it.  was so cool!  thanking you most kindly!  went to the carol service and had a good ol' chat with mr brunton.  he's the best! hehe.  well done jeni and claire in the singing.  
oh, anyone fill me in why its so funny to sing ""SHARK the herald angels sing"" ? please fill me in.

went back to school to watch to video of the Christmas Carol with the cast.  was a right old munching session.  home and ate lots... well not that much.  

louise and Charlii came round to get ready for the dance. no different to normal, we sat down, ate, talked, tehn remembered about 10 minutes before we had to leave that we had a dance to go to and thought it was probably i good idea to get ready.  neil came round before and found me in my multicoloured feecey skirt, hehe, so attractive! anyway, got ready, photos done etc (got them back, they're really good!) and jumped in a taxi to the school. 

teh dance was really good, i enjoyed it a lot more than i did last year.  managed to participate in every ceilidh dance.  didn't get my dance with mr brunton though.  did get a good photo of lou, myself and the dear man.  enjoyed it all.

the afterdance was really good too.  really enjoyed it.  back to lou's after for many more laughs.  hehehehehehe............ got up and helped lou pack for london. got the train and met alan to go homw with from town.  we saw david brown on our walk home, was funny...hehe.  


anyway.... friday was a good day, didnt do much that i can remember.  babysitting in the evening. was good fun with harry being amazed that i know pretty much every spike milligan poem of by heart (the cool being that i am).  after he learnt this he brought out his ""now we are six"" poetry b ook, A.A. Milne and again, i knew a fair few of them.. it is suitable at this point to remind you all that i use to be fat with very few friends, and i did spend my time with my chocolate and poetry books...hehe.  also have bruised shins now as harry found entertainment in jumping on me.

saturday, ali was vomiting lots so i was nursing her until mum took over and i went to meet tom to study.  we sat in the mitchell for about 17 hours and got about 2 mintues revision done.  was good though. talked lots.  

right, i am going to depart now and eat lunch! speak later

"event","hello! well its now sunday evening and once again i have done no work this weekend partly due to the fact that obese ali returned from England on friday and once again we are working our way through every supermarkets' entire stock... 39 stone on thursday... 104 today! oops! 

anyway it's been a mad weekend of house wrecking and carol singing, could it be any better? as i was on wednesday and thursday, but they don't count as ali wasn't there, i was singing in the choir for a Christmas carol on Friday and no matter what anyone says, i still cannot sing and was only given the part due to my excess height... unfortunately my star role as the central ornament of the lighthouse was taken away from me due to factors beyond my control but i am still confused as to where that part fit into the story anyway!
Had a fun night at the Jardine's on Friday, but again, that doesn't count as thy overlysized one was absent from my presense.

We bought 36000 metres of tinsel on saturday and after i buried myself in it a couple of times we decorated dads house with it and many a snow flake made by famous artistes such as louise, niki, beave, alan and of course ME... the house was looking stunning apart from the minor fact that ali was in it... 
the folk were a flocking to the front door and all invitees were allowed past the bouncers to join in the madness. annoying kelvinside people were left outside for the next 17 hours, im still not sure they have left actually, must check that! there were a lot of people there, varying stages of drunkeness, the main contenders for the most drunkan were gemma kirk and kerry... its a tough one but the vomit all over our bathroom convinces me that gemma wins, who would have thought it of quiet kirky?? i spent all today with a spoon siving out all forms of solids blocking the toilet and most of the west ends sewers, it was fun to the highest degree!
not much crack from the party, mainly people kissing (ooh!) and a guest appearance of our Ghanaian friend Shrek aka dad...

today after a comfy night sleep in a box with my sister, i awoke and began the tidying marathon, whoever wins can engorge on Asda tomoro... We swept and cleaned and then i wrapped myself in tinsle - head to toe - and sang my heart out to my loving sister at the square of the Prince. While she tried to concentrate on her studying, a voice of an angel resounded in her ear - 'all i want for christmas is you'. who could deny such a wish so she lept up and joined in our handshaking oohh ahing shenanigans...
now i am having a sleepover with thy fat one so i better go see how much of the bed she has consumed.
.............
the word you are looking for is .... anyway...
hey i heard that, 
well i said it loud
PHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBBBBEEEEEEEEEEE! sorry emit

ok, only have 15 mins to update as i really want to be in bed by eight. i'm in my pyjamas (or as the americans would spell it pajamas) and my face is washed, teeth are brushed, electric blanket is on.  all that is left for me to do is climb into the cosy nest and snuggle up. me and my siter use to always have competitions to decide who would make the warmer, comfier nest out of our bed sheets. naturally i'd always win.  that was when we shared a room. that no longer happens. its sad.  she phoned me during double maths on friday and told me she was having a pyjama party in newcastle.  not to mention how cool she is, it made me depressed. well, i lie. i didn't.  beave had fed me lucozade energy gel which made me some what hyper, but had i not consumed the apparent anti-depressant, i would have got depressed at teh news of my sister's slumber party.  BUT! unhappy i am no more for the dear child returns to the gow of glas on friday!  for me! she is a twinkling little star, how i love the way she are.....well, something along that line.  listening to the new Simon and Garfunkel album, ""Old Friends"", the live album from their tour last year and the song ""A Hazy Shade of Winter"" is playing. reminded me of Wed evening when the fog prevented my father flying back from Dublin.  this meant i could not see him (too foggy, and he was trapped in the land of leprechauns)  and he could not educate me about his knowledge of the world and al teh wonders it beholds.  back to the simon and garfunkel album. thanks tom.. tis the best gift! he also gave me Scott's Origional Miscellany, recommended by Mr Spike, which is pretty random and comical. i like it! in fact, i love it! merci.  you are not a ""fat and greazy citizen."" hehe.  did you know that if you are scared of garlic you have scorodophobia.  how interesting!hehe! thanks again my dear husband.  
.. / ._.. ___ ..._ . / _.__ ___ .._  ( ""i love you"" in morse code, hehe)
anyway! eight o'clock! i have to depart and sleep. or read more random facts to baffle you all with at a later date!

the ""she"" above is indeed myself. jsut been in strathallen for the day playing in a wind band.  was really not all teat great but got to see camilla and katy who i havn't seen for ages!  

it has been one of those weekends which has the potential to be really good but something on my mind(i dont know what) prevented it from being so.  friday after school, went to gavel. tom came with me but only stayed half the time. (neil, where were you?!?!?!)  walked home, got changed and went to esmee's for her dinner party.  was good fun, food was good and company was good too.  despite wat susan thinks, emma is a clone of leah.

saturday, woke up, got outa bed, dragged a comb .... not quite, but got ready to go to edinburgh (alond, lou dinghied me) to visit my beloved sister.  missed loads of trains cos of the fliping underground not functioning correctly and fat people blocking the ticket barriers.  actually cried i was so frustrated!  that set me in a bad mood which i managed to shift only when i got to edinburgh. found ali waiting for me with my twin aunties and sarah so was good. took us for lunch at harvey nics. met shona mcqueen and danielle dexter. was good. had manky food tho, gnocci, tasted like dumplings. and im not a fussy person. aste it all though.  left liz and margaret(who gave me my middle names) and ali and i went to meet dave and pippa. was cool to see them, but left them fairly soon to catch the train home.  alan text me and told me he couldnt come to ashley's party. the unexplained frustration washed over me agian until, the only way to prevent myself from drowing in is was to get angry at alan. so i did, then felt guilty and apologised.  went to see him on teh way to ashley's and tried to convice him to come, cos i couldnt be bothered going on my own.  but he wouldnt budge cos he's a twat(as i informed him) went to the party and knew all the girls but only one guy, tom, who kept me company until id had enough to drink to talk to complete randoms and make a tit of myself. dougie was speaking to me about graeme.  was funny, thought we were going out. hehe.  phoned alan in a rather hyper state to try to convince him once more to come but he wouldn't, so i enjoyed it alone.  only i wasnt alone and soon gemma, poppy, the fabiens and ppl all turned up. david s and jack too, so talked to all of tehm, was good fun after that.  had to be home reasoonably early cos of teh early rise today, so walked home, via alan's to have a chat. got hoem and slept streaight away. anyway., that was my weekend, most exciting.  got to go now to do work, or chat, or whatever takes my fancy.

"event","Una came over on saturday morning and mum took us to teh underground. had to get teh long way round cos the inner circle was kaput. that was fun.  got the train and explored the exciting(english) town of Carlisle in our 45 mins train change.  it was a really cute place actually, had teh little brass band in teh littel band stand! immense.

met ali at Newcastle station where she had rushed to after meeting Matthew Pinncent.  we walked back to her halls and tehn went for a drink somewhere. met random rob from edinburgh who was ginger, talked a lot and within an hour of meeting the guy told me where he pissed when he was drunk. in later conclusion it became apparent that he is an oddball.

we went back to ali's halls and met many of her uni friends who all seemed to congregate in her little room.  random rob also found his way there which was a surprise... ""magic dave"" turned up and convinced ppl to go out for drinks for his birthday so our night in was changed to our night out.  ate pasta out the pan and got ready to go out.  we went to a bar in the gate and was an odd night.  i tried to convince random rob i was a goat farmer from aberdeen, also throwing in teh fact that i was a man called Shaun... told ""magic dave's"" brother that i was ali's older sister and studying in aberdeen.  when ali told me i couldn't talk to him anymore because he was 27 i sneakily tiptoed behind the bar and made friends with complete strangers to all, Iain and Micheal who were 22 adn from somewhere 2 hours away from Newcastle, where-i cannot recall.  despie my excellent hiding ali seaked me out and gave me a hug, pushing us both to teh ground, ali busting her lip in the process.  slightly embarrasing but comical to look back at.  teh crowd were all moving to some other bar but ali was smashed out her face so had to get her home (hehe ali, how sad are you!?! you know its true!) 

found her chips and cheese which was good, random rob found us which was bad.  ali spewed in various spots in newcastle and i remember running in and out of random bars to get napkins for her so i wouldn't get touched my teh sick, didn't work, she threw up in my hands. thanks ali.  managed to support her to a taxi-me on one side, random rob on teh other,  he was being so sleazy! ""Come on alison, jsut pretend i'm your boyfriend and put your arm round me, you're alright darlin'"" SHUT IT RANDOM ROB.  i recall saying to ali ""do u realise how comical this is, you have rob sleasing all over you and theres no dignified way to get out of it, haha, ur in a bad state.""  managed to eventually get her into a taxt where she spat in my hands in attempt to get out more sick. took her home and dumped her on her bed where random rob stood with his back turned and told us we could undress her while wasn't looking.  so we told him to get lost.  he did, but got unlost three times that night and managed to knock on teh door with bread on one occasion, advice on another occasion and an offer of rennie resolve on another.  oddball.

spent a rather uncomfortable night on the floor but was alright. ali woke with a big lip, hehe, and a purple knee which was a mystery to us all.  spent a quiet day on sunday, went to see ""The Terminal"" and got carryout in teh evening and watched legally blond in one of ali's fellow medic's room. 

Andrew Berg came to teh halls so managed to excape the bum numbing experience of sitting politely in a randoms room by going with ali and una to talk to him.  

monday morning, ali had lectures starting at 9 so una and i slept in tehn wandered into newcastle to get breakfast.  by complete chance i saw Hazel who had Morna visiting her so ran up with excitment to say hi to them!  was so cool to see them.  made my day!  then when i was waiting at the cashline i saw another girl i knwo from Wales, Lucy, so also ran up to her.  Then later again i was walking back to meet ali and saw Rab. was an eventful morning!

Had lunch with ali and rachel then una and i went to get the train. una left me at edinburgh so arrived into glasgow and got teh bus home. went to see susan to find out the excitement of her weekend then came home to sleep.

had a good time in newcastle, spent way too much money though. oh well!

hope that mentioned u enough ali, love u!

"event","heylo, as the september weekend draws to a close i sit in my sisters lonely little bedroom, alone and without musci as the disk player on teh computer is not working.  its a pretty cool computer all teh same, jo built it for us and is petty wicked.  
i've not been on this for ages so quick update of teh past week or so.
17th-CAt's 21st, mum flew to see her in Lyon. 
     Start of my WOSIS weekend where iain left me to go play the guitar and with leaving, he broke his title of being my trumpet buddy.
18th-lunch at neil's then WOSIS until 6.30.  went to see alan after to give him teh tickets for the concert for him, lou and beave.  ended up spending ages juwst walking and talking.
19th-WOSIS yet again, spoke to Iain lots between rehersals.  performed in teh concert and had lou back for a while afterwards.
20th-Scott's birthday and Claire and i bought him a cake which was produced in physics. was quite comical.  Orchestra and Wind Band.
21st-Went to my extra maths lesson, teheee...had speech after school, got panicy about my dissertation but oh well, still not paniced enough to actually start working for it.
22nd-hockey, walked home with alan, went babysitting but all teh kids were out so babysat myself for ages before Scott finally came home and i started earning my money.
23rd-had 24 hour sports where i played a total of one hour of sports, its a scam. it was good fun all teh same. we went to the park between matches and played hockey outside so it was good fun. lou, tom, beave, alan and i all had pizza afterwards, played table tennis and watched Pretty Woman. its a great film!
24th- lou and i got up early and ran to byres road to put my photos in to be developed, teh ones from teh dance.  went back to mine and showered.  someone phoned the house and louise answered pretending to be my babysitter. was funny though cos the person was phoning to ask if i could babysit for tehm so got slightly confused. went to IKEA as part fo our day out, hehehe... spend the day together and came back to the west end. we went to the rugby for about 10 mins and beave and alan came back to mine for curry. watched teh rest of Pretty Woman and also watcehd Erin Brokovich.  was fun.
oh, too long an update, too boring, thats enough for now

"event","sinish my last, rather boring, update. thursday ali left for uni. twas a sad event, made more sad by the fact she woke me at 5 in the mornign to pack the car. not impressed.
louise and i helped at junior SU at lunch, it was so cool!  we were exercising!lol. was great and the kida are so decent!

CCF after school, met alan in the park after that and walked home.  

friday, SU at lunch, had a laugh in geography. walked home. had dinner, met alan and went to the grosvenor to see the village.  it was a bit of a crap film to be truthful.  by the time it was over it was absolutely pouring so we got very wet walking home. alan decided it would be funny tho to wet me further by pouring(and spitting) his bottle of water all over me.  funny guy... was pretty funny actually, but still.
saturday was pretty uneventful. up ben lomond bofre midday then went to town to get cat's 21st present, found something and went home.  today went up connich with mum and came home and made dinner. 
has been one of those pretty unevenful weekends that i love! tehee... couldn't do it too often but i like jsut having time with my mum.
speak soon, keep smiling,

"event","been a week since i wrote, probably a good thing cos it means i wont write about every event that has occured in the past seven days but a selected few.
monday was pretty uneventful as far as i can remember...orchestra at lunch and windband after school.  big cool dude!
tuesday would be the day that louise convinced me to join theatre choir...hehe....and i was made to sing the soprano part when really i could sing the base so not a good choice.  will change next week.
wednesday had swing band at lunch ( man, a musical week i have!) and hockey.  got out of hockey early cos it was a fantabulous day so walked along to meet beave so we could walk home together.  we were stuck with a little luck and his mother gave us a lift.  saw gemma, leah and charlii in the west end. i haven't seen gemma for so long!  it is so strange that you can be someones closest friend for so long (6 years or so) but because of one event you can completely drift.  it was cool to see her all the same. [on the same line, talking to hannah at the moment, i really need to catch up with her soon! its so difficult to arrange things though, oh well, will make the effort]
went out for dinner with ali and mum on wednesday night because ali was leaving for uni on thursday.we went to the bothy at the back of byres road, it was really nice. been there before with cat and ollie.
had haggis, was so comical!  anyway....mrs anderson came into the restaurant and i've not seen her for ages! she is such a class lady!oh gotta go, will finishthis in a mo

"event","ok, wednesday night i went to graeme's concert which was really good!  so impressive! and was also great to catch up with, even if only briefly, graeme.  recognised quite a few faces so was glad i went along. thanks for inviting me g!

thursday at school neil came to find lou and i at lunch as he had a ""surprise"" for us... so after many ponderous minutes, waiting to find out what was ready to surprise us, neil lead us to a mr john beveridge!  was a great surprise! tehee.... what a guy!?
thursday night- the drifters!!!tehee....so comical... it was jsut me and mum who went, susan was meant to join us but she was ill, i hardly saw her at all this week which sucks.  almost had alan convinced to join me but his phobia of parents prevented that happening.  what a fool.  was an awfully random night anyway, so entertaining!

friday night-  walked home with beav which was good, chatting away, and met ellie at kelvinside and went back to hers for the eve.  was so good to catch up with her!  i ahvn't seen her properly for about 6 months!  was so exciting!!!  its wierd, tehres some ppl who i hardly see but as soon as we are reunited we never have a quiet moment. she was working on saturday so my dad picked me up at bout 10 ish and i came home and slept right through to 11 o'clock on saturday.   i'm a lazy crap, i love it.  
susan came round on sat and ali, su and i went to byres rd to collect susans photos.  then al and i went down to comet to try find her a laptop.  the guy serving us was utterly hopeless though so we left and went to town.  ali also had to purchase lab coats for uni so was pretty entertaining in the shop trying them on.
walked home and being lazy ppl we sat in teh park for ages when neil text saying he was in teh west end so al and i went to meet him for a while.  bumped into andrew gilmour, phil gilchrist and robin baird (again, exactly the same as last week)  neil got ropen into coming back to get rid of viruses on our computer.  very much appreciated i can tell you!  as payment we allowed him to stay for dinner...(not that it was a matter of allowing, he was mroe than welcome!)
kelly and claire came round for dinner too and ali ahd vik and alex round so was a big gathering! nikki, liz, jack, alan, beav and tom all came round after dinner and neil left.  all congregated in the top room and shortly into the evening the cd player broke so alan and i went round to my mums to get my protably cd player and tehn round to his to collect something.  i met nicola huthcinsons cousin...so random!she's friends with jo. back to dads and basically just dossed about for hte night.  after not feeling to great at the begining of the night, it got better!  

got slightly scared when i spoke to my mum this morning when, after me telling her i was shattered, she seemed to know that i'd had ppl round. not that it was hidden from ehr, but i was at my dads so didnt really understand.  she was asking how long after 2 alan stayed.  i had no idea how she'd known he was still at my house and after her having an entertaingin 5 mins teasing me and telling me she had spies on me she admitted that she had met alans motehr, in the glittering glamour of the rubbish dump... made a bit more sense! 
went to mugdock with dad, debbie and ali this afternoon. gotta go do all my homework now so speak later, 
man, a long update!

"event","man, so much is happening at the moment but none of it seems fair to share on the internet.  its so queer how people and things go through stages in your life and you never completely understand it all.  i think i must blank out sections of my life because i always find things out about my life, things i've said, ways i've acted etc, after they happen. this is one explanation, that i have big gaping holes in my memory or else it could be down to pure, irritatingly out of line, exagerated, crap filled, GOSSIP. 
anyway, things are going alright except from the big gaping holes and the information being thrown into them.  ali's still here which is, lets be truthful, bloddy awful cos she makes me eat constantly!  FATTY!  tehee... not but realy, its great.  the two of us went through to edinburgh yesterday and had the most annoying child behind us on the bus.  she was so stupid. she said to her gran ""i would love to be a twin but i dont think i can now, unless my mum has another child.""  what a fool! she was not even that young so really had no excuse.
we met up with my auntie for coffee then went to look at st artists etc.  met up with pippa later and got the bus back with her. 
school today, cant be assed. came home after a detoured walk with al, beav and alex then went to susans because i mess her. 
just had a great conversation with ellie. shes such a fab friend. we go for so long without talking(not our own choice) but when we do catch up i can tell her absolutely everything. she's fabby! i think she probably knows so many more random  things about my life than i do.  tis great!
anyway, mother wants me to go to bed so night, 
sleep well etc

"event","heyho...as i thought i would be, i am currently reflecting on what i have done in the past week...a week ago today i climbed table mountain in the stifling heat.  also went to marco's for dinner-an crazy african restaurant with live music and dancers.  was pretty cool-tried ostrich, kudu, and springbok. friday, i went shopping in teh morning with ali and then we went for afternoon tea at mount nelsons hotel-was fantastic!  got on the plane in teh evening and sat beside a random engineer who was building a car in port elizabeth...he found this so exciting that he talked to mea bout it for over 3 hours.  i eventually managed to shut him up by ""sleeping"".  
arrived in heathrow on saturday morning and drove to my grandparents house in chertsey.  had a good day there. i went for a run in an attemp to get fit but then joined all the adults in my family to a massive chinease ""all you can eat"" meal.  so may be a bit fitter but was a load fatter!
i was woken by my little cousin molly on sunday morning who, after trying to scare me all of the previous day by shouting boo any time i was near, got due payback!!! she had insisted that i couldn't scare her so when she woke me, i pretented to be asleep until she leant right over me and i turned round and roared at her.  i found it incredibly amusing until i realized i made the poor girl cry!  im an ogre!  but it really was so comical, the look on her face!  tehee...oops.
went to my big family gathering that we have every 2 years or so and at first took me a while to recognise distant relatives.  none of my closest cousins were there and neither of my sisters so i was so glad when my 2nd cousins jack and daisy arrived so i had them to talk to along iwth a distanly related someone, sarah, who is so sound!so was great to catch up with everyone but depressing to think that i was going home the next day, school in 3 days time!
was glad to arrive home but found noone else was around. hadn't seen my mother for a month and she was working, all my friends were busy sso i was so happy when jack called me and i met up with him and chris.  saw mum and had a good chat with her! 
SUSAN CAME OVER!!!hadnt seen ehr for so long! i missed her so much!
tuesday, met hcarlii and we went to town to meet up with others. was good to see everyone and was so happy to randomly bump in to louise!  i hadn't seen her for so long!  went with alan to collect his kilt and caught up with him-heard all about their trip.  went back to his to see jen and hear all about ghana!  got home about 7.30, ate dinner and got things ready for school!

met alan, jo and beav early on wednesday morning to walk to school.  when we arrived really felt like we hadnt been on holiday at all.  saw everyone again and found out our form classes. mine is pretty good. got mr brunton as form tutor and with claire so tis all good!

classes are ok too.  good teachers etc.  hockey was alright. my sister is home!  spoke to other sister last night.  shes settled in in france!  glad to hear.  

anyhoo...back at the ranch...(tehee)my granny and papa are here-just celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary!  and i missed the party!  how sad!  but want to go talk to them so speak later.  hope everyone is settling into whatever they're doing!
speak later, smile!x

"event","my trip in south africa is coming to an end and its a depressing thought!  this past week has been immense, and the weather has kept up for us making it all more enjoyable.  i'm back in cape town now, arrived abut half an hour ago, and dad, debbie and ali have all gone out for dinner but i'm seriously shattered so not joind them.  we went on a few game drives in two different areas yesterday and the day before and saw loads of elephants!  we saw one that was 3 days old, it was tiny!  i took (far too amny) photos so if your unlucky enough to be shown them you will certainly see many of the long nosed beings.  also saw giraffes, white rhinos, lions, leopards, a cheetah, and hundreds of warthogs.  i love warthogs!  they are immense!!!! 
mum gave me my results.  i needed much persuasion as i really didnt want to be told but she was biting her fingernails.  isn't is upsetting how much exams affect your parents, its really me who should be worrying.  but tats not me...tehee
anyway, keep smiling x
 
ps, neil, i finished catch 22, still slightly confused over parts but hey, thats really funny!"

"event","heylo, still in africa!  went on the best boat trip ever 2 days ago. i dont like boats much but it was fantastic!  we saw loads of whales, about 2 meters away from us, i'm not joking it was so impressive!  they were undertaking the act of mating... it was damn cool.  we also had great white sharksswimming under our boat-must have seen about 11 of tehm.  tehy were lso pretty insane!
 ali and i did a tandem bridge jump yesterday, teh biggest one in the world, tehee.  it was pretty scary but really fun.  i think it was mosre scary having ali beside me cos she was flipping shitting herself.  glad i di it though!
hope anyone who got exam results did well, cant say wat i got cos i happily dont know!!! tehee.... and i'm so not botehred. 
right, gotta go look around here boefore i have to meet dad and debbie again, 
hope your all well, speak soon

"event","ok, more time to update as i currently have my sister waiting to write some e-mails herself. so haha ali.  so today we got up and had the best breakfast ever.  so much fresh fruit, carrot, avacado, cheese.  was great!  we got in our micro bus and travelled along the coast watching surfers and seeing boats.  managed to get invited to go whale watching and saw 2 whales near by, was pretty damn impressive.   the sun shone for us too so was good fun!  
got back to the car and drove on teo boulders beach to see the penguins.  there were hundreds of them! took loads of photos so you'll have the pleasure of looking at them all when i return.  
just back from dinner, went to an italein nd had good food! all i care about!  it was immense and so i'm going to get fat, neil, the plan is finally starting.  i'm on my way i can tell you!!!

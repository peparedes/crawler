<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Saying hello.  Am I bothering you?</b>  *eyebrow*

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *without thinking* <b>Everyone bothers me --</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>So no.</b>  *wanders around his lab, curious*

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>Is there -- can I help you?</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Just satisfy my academic curiosity.  It's been twenty years since I've been in a potions lab.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>Don't touch that.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *amused* <b>Which?</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *through his teeth* Any of it.

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Shall I put my hands behind my back, then?</b>  *dryly*

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>If you don't think you'll be able to keep them to yourself otherwise.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>I make no promises.</b> *tucks her hands in her pockets*  *so so amused*

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>If you cannot promise to respect my workspace, I'll have to ask you to leave it.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>I did not expect to ever meet someone with less of a sense of humour than my own.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  What does humour have to do with anything?

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>I'm teasing you, Severus.  Good naturedly, I might add.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *knits his brow* <b>I don't understand.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>I find it particularly  humorous that you are telling <i>me</i> I ought keep <i>my</i> hands to myself.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *looks blankly at her*

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *laughs* <b>Don't tell me you've blocked the whole affair out.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *bites the side of his tongue when he clenches his teeth*  <b>Are you intending to suggest that the ... whole affair, as you say, was at my instigation?</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>I'm suggesting you made the first physical move.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>On the contrary.  You had been throwing yourself at me for whole minutes.  I'd simply grown weary of your games.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *eyes go wide* <b><i>Throwing</i> myself at you?</b> *incredulous*  <b>I was entirely unaware of any attraction until you threw your pheromones at me.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>Oh, please.  It was you who came sniffing at my neck, and that after you'd invaded my personal space in the first instance and made gestures of beating at me with your fists.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>I was <i>angry.</i>  And then merely curious.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *scoffs*

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *glares* <b>Are you accusing me of <i>arranging</i> that?</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *spreads his hands in a you-tell-me gesture*  <b>I came to your laboratory to speak to you, and the next thing I knew you were, as the students put it, 'in my face', and babbling about your racing pulse and practically shoving your nose in my throat.  What am I meant to accuse you of?</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> You baited me into an absolutely ridiculous argument!  *throws up her hands*  Have you never been confronted before?

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>Baited you?!  What are you  --</b> *suddenly suspicious* <b>-- and what am I to understand from your coming down here this evening?</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font>  <b>I thought perhaps the irritation between us had dissipated.  That perhaps we could speak in a civil tone.  But no, despite our trysts I find you as frustrating as ever.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *sputtering*  <b>You find me -- ?!  How is it my fault that I annoy you when I come to your lab, and also my fault that I annoy you when you come to mine?</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>I'm not certain you have a civil bone in your body.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *draws himself up to his full height* <b>I beg your pardon.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *firmly* <b>You treat me as if I were some small child, irresponsible and foolish, when I express interest in your academics, for one.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>I do nothing of the kind.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>You do.  I come down here to, and I quote 'say hello' and 'satisfy intellectual curiosity' and you tell me not to <i>touch</i> anything.  As if I had no common sense nor ran a laboratory of my own.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>My interest in not having my work disturbed has nothing to do with you specifically.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Do you have <i>any</i> respect for me?</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>Of course I have.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Really.</b> *dryly*  <b>So you'd respect someone who would put her hands all over experiments she doesn't understand?</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>It never occurred to me that you wouldn't understand them.  That wasn't the point.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>You're missing <i>my</i> point.  I likely don't understand them... but do you honestly believe I was going to touch an unmarked cauldron?</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *uncomfortable*  <b>One takes appropriate precautions.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Exactly my point.  It was inappropriate.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>Suppose some time someone nobody would believe would ever touch an unmarked cauldron, <i>touches</i> an unmarked cauldron.  Of what consolation would it be, to stand over the smoking crater where the school had just been, and say I respected him too much to remind him not to do so?</b>  *raises an eyebrow*  <b>I would remind the Headmistress herself of the same thing, if she came into my lab, and if she could not promise, I would ask even her to leave.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>.....</b> *bursts out laughing*

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *confused*

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font>  <b>I thought you were being <i>rude.</i>  You're just <i>paranoid.</i></b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b><i>Cautious</i>.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Paranoid.</b>  *patpats his shoulder*

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *flinches just slightly*  <b>Paranoia implies delusion.  I know perfectly well that they're out to get me.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *claps a hand over her own mouth to keep from laughing aloud again*

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *raises an eyebrow*  <b>You find the constant moral peril of a colleague amusing?</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>I'm sorry.  I am.  I'm just... reasonably certain no one is out to kill you, Severus.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *quite simply* <b>You are mistaken.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *tilts her head*  <b>Who on earth would want you dead?</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>There are many.  I was a double agent in the last war, which of course means I had few friends on either side.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>...hm.  I was unaware.  I.. am not particularly well-versed in any aspects of this war.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>No.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>No.</b>  *shakes her head slightly* <b>I have been meaning to read on it, but...</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>You will find few, if any, unbiased accounts.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>That is the nature of war.</b>  *leans her hip carefully on the bench next to her*  <b>What about your accounting?</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>... I fought on the winning side.  Surely my account would be as skewed as anyone else's.</b>  *folds his arms into his sleeves*  <b>For a disinterested opinion, you might ask one of the ghosts.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>I don't want a disinterested opinion.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>How will you learn the truth, if your information comes through a filter?</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>All truth comes through a filter.  I just pick my filters carefully.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *cocks his head*

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>I trust you.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>... Why?</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>I have read a goodly number of your academic works.  There is an honesty there.  Also, I think we have been... intimate enough... that a certain level of trust is imputed.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>...</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *eyebrows up* 

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>I am.</b>  *clears his throat* <b>Unaccustomed to being trusted.  By -- that is, by people who have a choice in the matter.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font>  <b>Mm.  Well, I hope you can adjust your worldview sufficiently.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>I.</b>  *looks around the room, helplessly; does not ask <i>What do you want from me?</i>*  <b>Why have you come down here, really?</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Company.  I genuinely hoped we could speak as colleagues.</b>  *certainly won't outright note she was hoping for a repeat performance*  *not even to herself, really*

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>About what?  People don't deliberately seek my company.  As you must have noticed.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font>  <b>I am not 'people', Severus.  There are not many minds in this world I consider my equal.  Yours is one of them.  The topic was less important than the social intercourse.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *looks sharply at her, then registers the word 'social'*

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *was deliberately teasing him with that*  *gives him a little smirk*

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *can't deny that he's a little intrigued ... but also rather alarmed*

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *curious* <b>I scare you a little, don't I?</b>  *takes a step forward*

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>It's not that -- yes.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Why?</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>You are ... not like other people.  I find that unsettling.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>I am unsocialized.</b>  *small smile* <b>Thank you.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>That isn't what I meant.  Everyone -- for years, I have been feared, hated, or occasionally ruled.  You do none of these things.  You seem to tolerate me.</b>  *clears his throat as he becomes aware of the extent of this understatement; she'd done a great more than merely 'tolerate' him, in her lab*  <b>As you say, you are not 'people'.  And</b> *this is difficult for him to admit* <b>I don't know how to --</b> *gestures*

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *finishes his sentence* <b>Relate?  You are... not intimidating to me.  And though occasionally irritating, now that I understand your paranoia that level is rather low.  If you wish my advice... go with your instincts.</b>  *quirk of a smile* <b>It has served us quite well until now.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *concentrates on not retreating as she comes closer*  <b>Professor Vector.  Are you trying to seduce me?</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *tips her head to one side*  <b>Not deliberately.  Though I will not deny the last was rather satisfying.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>It --</b> *clears his throat* <b>it was.  Though it was not, I think, how such things are normally done.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Being that the last I contemplated this was when I was a girl of fifteen, I must ask - how are such things normally done?</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>Well -- horizontally, I believe, for one thing.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Ah, yes.  In a bed, I believe, is the most common.</b>  *leans on the lab bench again, now two feet from him at best*

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *curls his hands into fists, inside his sleeves where she can't see*  <b>Yes, that too -- the surroundings were out of the ordinary.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Mmm.  Quite.</b>  *tilts her head* <b>I don't mind if you don't.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>Well, minding would be irrelevant at this juncture, would it not?  One cannot change the past.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b><i>I</i> was speaking in future tense.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *startled into a cough*  <b>Oh.  I see.  Er.  ... Are you suggesting that we meet in your laboratory later?</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Hm, are you busy now?</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *totally at sea, hasn't known how to play this for several minutes now* <b>Not especially?</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Then why would we meet <i>later</i>?</b> *reaches out and unnecessarily adjusts his collar*

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *tenses up*

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font>  <b>I see.  You're not interested.  Very well, no harm in asking.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>I -- what?</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Your posture indicates you would very much like to remove yourself from this situation.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>Does it?</b>  *tries to relax, but doesn't know how*  <b>It is an involuntary reaction to an unfamiliar, er, stimulus.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *right back to amused*  <b>Are you interested?</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *swallows; whispers* <b>Of course I am.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Then I suggest we find a horizontal surface before we disturb any experiments.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *glances at his desk before he can stop himself*

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *calmly leans behind herself and locks his door*

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>What -- but -- are you --</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Preventing a student from walking in on us.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>Here?!</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *nods to his desk* <b>I think it's an excellent suggestion.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *looks from her to his desk and back again a couple of times*  <b>I wasn't -- I didn't mean -- oh.</b>  *thinks for a moment*  <b>Very well.</b>  *flicks his wand to move his papers, ink bottle, and so forth ... elsewhere*

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *glides over to perch on the edge of the desk once it's clear*  *holds out one hand to him, expectantly*

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *steps closer to her; puts his hand in hers*"

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>I am at a loss as to how you are supposed to be like Sirius Black.  Unless it is that he, too, was infernally annoying.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *startled that someone is speaking to him at dinner*  <b>Have you?</b>  *nods* <b>Each member of staff ought to be entitled to adequate workspace.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Yes.</b>  *glances at him a bit sideways*  <b>I thought you would want to know, considering your vehement disapproval of my sharing the shared space.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *rolls his eyes*  <b>As the common space is not <i>work</i> space, yes, I did disapprove.  Just as I imagine you'd disapprove if I set up a cauldron in the entrance hall.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *knits his brow*  <b>I don't understand you.</b>  *thinks for a moment*  <b>Why would I value the opinions of individuals who -- no, I know.  Early in my ...</b> *ambiguous gesture* <b>professional life, it was important to earn the respect of those I worked with and for, if not their affinity.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> *gives him a curious look and shakes her head*  <b>It isn't about the value <i>you</i> put on those opinions.

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Please, Professor.  I guarantee there is not a person at this table, <i>including</i> the Headmistress, who knows a single thing about my personal life, research, or after-hours activities.

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>I am not suggesting you should have made <i>friends</i>, Professor. I am simply suggesting you should put aside this pretense that your attitude is deliberate and not merely convenient.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>Well.</b>  *turns back to his dinner*  <b>As we've already established, the ease with which you believe things is of little importance to me.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>If you aren't up to the challenge, Professor, that isn't my business.  It's merely a suggestion.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>It's not a matter of <i>challenges</i>, Professor.  You haven't explained why you think I should care if any of these dunderheads like me or not.</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>My research is ongoing.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>That's academic code for 'too long'.</b>  *thin smile*

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *thinner smile*  <b>It is 'code' for I don't have discrete ideas and set up little experiments and expect everything to have a beginning and a tidy end.  In the course of my work, from time to time revolutionary concepts emerge.</b>

<font color=""blue""><b>VECTOR:</b></font> <b>Semantics, Professor.  When was the last time a revolutionary concept emerged?</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>What difference can that possibly make?</b>

RL.  Bloody seal had the initials on it, as well, and for one idiotic moment I allowed myself to believe -- not that I could reasonably expect to be hearing from Remus Lupin, of course.  The man was no friend of mine when he was alive, and in any event he's been dead over a year.  Today's owl could not have come from him; that would be impossible.  But how much would we rather believe in the impossible, however tiresome it would be, when the alternative is a certainty that freezes the blood in our very veins?

I would rather be bored for the rest of my life than interested ever again, if 'interested' is to be understood in the Confucian sense."

"event","My job as Potions Master here at Hogwarts, as I understand it, is threefold:  first, to keep the place (primarily the infirmary) supplied with whatever potions are necessary; second, to provide guidance and leadership and some sort of pastoral care for the members of Slytherin House; and third, to teach children how to brew, handle, and store potions.

I am aware that most of you outside my own House hate me.  I could hardly be unaware of it, since you seem to leap on every opportunity to eviscerate me in song and story.  No matter; I don't especially like many of you, either, and furthermore it makes absolutely no difference to the performance of my duties whether anyone not in Slytherin considers me any sort of friend.

You will all admit, however, that I do my job and I do it well.  Since I arrived at Hogwarts as Potions Master more than twenty years ago, the infirmary has only wanted for potions when I have been literally unable to get my hands on the necessary ingredients.  It may be true that the majority of our Hogwarts-trained enemies in the War came from Slytherin, but at the same time, the majority of Slytherins did not make themselves our enemies -- and in any event, a Head of House is not a parent, and should not try to be one.

And finally, my students do learn to brew and handle and store potions.  I challenge any one of you to deny it.  If I frighten rather than coddle them, they are more likely to pay attention in my class rather than attempt to take advantage of my good nature -- and in any event, the main point is, what I teach them, they learn.  Even the sainted Harry Potter, who a) was a capable but by no means enthusiastic student, and b) I suppose <s>hated</s> hates me more than all the Longbottoms and Weasleys and Creeveys of the world put together, passed his Potions OWL with an 'Exceeds Expectations'.  So I'll thank the rest of you to do your jobs and leave off trying to tell me how to do mine."

<font color=""#CC99FF""><b>GWENDOLYN:</b></font> *a fresh wave of tears spilling down her face* <b>They're saying that Professor Weasley</b> *sobs* <b>that Professor Weasley married that- that werewolf!</b>

<font color=""#CC99FF""><b>GWENDOLYN:</b></font> *shakes her head* <b>She's not my aunt anymore.  Mother and Father said so!</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  *sighs*  <b>Of course they did.  Then, by 'that werewolf', you mean the woman who used to be your father's sister, but is somehow no longer your relation at all?</b>

<font color=""green""><b>SNAPE:</b></font>  <b>Not in the least.</b>

<font color=""#CC99FF""><b>GWENDOLYN:</b></font> <b>His family are poor and Muggle-lovers and blood-traitors and not received in Polite Society!  But he is so kind and it's not just that he's handsome, sir.  He's very knowledgeable!  Not as clever as you, of course. </b>

<font color=""#CC99FF""><b>GWENDOLYN:</b></font> *swallows*  <b>Well, I shouldn't love him, should I? Because his family isn't acceptable.  But he's so- he's so wonderful!</b>

<font color=""#CC99FF""><b>GWENDOLYN:</b></font> *manages to look horrified and hopeful, all at once*

However, I know you all spend a great deal of time perusing these journals (which are nothing more than fodder for gossip), and so I shall make a statement.

It is <em>Friday</em> evening.  Instead of eating dinner and retiring (thankfully!) to my quarters for the weekend, I was summoned by an hysterical 4th year student who seemed to think I might have an interest in the health of one <em>Professor</em> Potter.

The <em>remarkable boy</em>, it seems, willfully ignored symptoms of the flu and--careless of the students he might infect in his selfish desire for recognition--worked his fragile body into a state of <em>exhaustion</em>.  <s>As if--</s>  

He has been given a sleeping draught and is resting in the infirmary (getting him there was hardly an easy task.  He is as difficult now as the day he first arrived at Hogwarts, an arrogant glory-seeking 1st year.).

I have informed Professor McGonagall, and thus performed my duties in the matter.  In the future, should the famous Professor Potter require assistance, it would be wise to exhaust <em><u>all other possibilities</u></em> before calling upon me.

I shall answer no more questions regarding the well-being of Professor Potter."

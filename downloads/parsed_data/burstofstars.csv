"event","so today was an eventful day. I woke up cleaned the house. exciting! not! then i went to the bookstore to look at decorating books that didnt go to well. there wasnt to many books that had what i was looking for. oh well i guess i ll just have to be creative all by myself. Ronnie came up to the bookstore and then he came to my house to hang out for a lil bit and we played video games. then ASh came over and we left to go skim boarding at the beach, that didnt go to well either since it was choppy out. then it started to ran but i wanted to walk to the end of the peir cause i saw that Hank was down there fishing... so we walked in the rain all the way down there to say hi and now im at home. i live such an exciting life."

"event","Wow i never saw that one coming! Maybe it is going to all work out for me... Yesterday when lynds told me the whole story i didnt know what to say... i couldnt stop smiling it was good to hear that.. and i was in need of that. my hopes have def. came back. I cant believe he asked if i was seeing any one. and then when lynds had told him that a couple of guys were after me hes like oh? and Lynds was like yeah but she didnt like them soo you know. hes like well maybe ill start hanging out with you guys again. 

OMG! its weird how he asks about me and then wants to start hanging out again. 

there was only one thing that me and lynds def didnt agree on with what he had said. I guess lynds had told him how much we miss talking with his mom and hes like well you can come over anytime you want to but if Jenna* the dreaded name* car is there dont stop by. and Lynds was like uhhh Derek i could care less if her car is there or not if im coming to say hi to your mom then it doesnt matter to me who is there just as long as she is. Way to go Derek with the whole keeping Jenna happy... why not do things to keep you happy instead of her. No girl she tell any guy what he can and can not do.. oh yeah and he says that she ""lets"" him hang out with his guy friends with no problem. ummm lets? no she shouldnt have any control over that either. ahhh shes dumb.. new mission in life get rid of Jenna."

"event","yeah this was a day to remember! lol i met up with Sam at her work and then we went to the mall to get a her a tshirt that she wanted and then as we were leaving we were throwing away our food and she ended up putting her bad w/the tshirt in the trash can so i was laughing pretty hard at that! and then we about to walk out of the mall and a big boom happened and i about had a heart attack! it was freaking storming and lightening had hit close.. so then we go to CD warehouse to get some cds and then we had to go to Wins house to drop something and he lives right across from Derek. :) so yes i wanted to drive by his house since it was right there and i miss him so much. so we were driving by and i look into the shop cause the door was open and yep sure enough there he is standing with no shirt on! and he happened to look over at me. I HAVE BEEN CAUGHT! oh well he probably thinks im stalking him but thats not the case cause i just wanted to see his house again since i was right there. GOD i miss him so! u was shaking so badly after i saw him standing there. i can just imagine how i would be in person but i will never have to worry about that cause he is never coming back... man that hurts to read that! ahhh! i dont know what to do anymore! 

this song just happened to be playing as i was passing his house. 

I'm so close to crazy
Right on the edge
Just one step away from going insane
But I'm not there yet
If I could just lose my mind
I wouldn't know we're through
But this close to crazy
Is far from over you

Today I caught myself 
Reliving how it used to be
At a table for two just you and me
But talking to an empty chair
And laughing right out loud
Turned everybody's head and left no doubt
I'm a broken woman close to breaking down

i wish some one would be like you she is a great person and you should give it another try! I WISH!"

"event","But once you've learned to be lonely
And lonely is the only thing you've known
It begins to feel like home
It becomes your comfort zone
Once you've learned to be without someone
And settle for the silence of an empty room
Oh,it changes you
There's a lot you have to undo
Once you've learned to be lonely--REBA



I can feel the darkness reaching in
As I touch the place you may as well have never been
Love can hurt much more than one can bear
When a heart beats for someone who's not there

How many times must I tell myself that you're gone
When will the rest of me wake up and see what went wrong... So wrong
And turn on the light and pick up the phone and just call
And lay pride aside
If I had any sense left at all

Voices call that only I can hear
Who would have thought love was something I would fear
Almost home, almost there, almost taste
On my mind, in my heart, on my face

How many times must I tell myself that you're gone
When will the rest of me wake up and see what went wrong... So wrong
And turn on the light and pick up the phone and just call
And lay pride aside
If I had any sense left at all

Oh just lay pride aside
If I had any sense left at all--REBA"

"event","Well its another day... 

Last night Sam and I went DT cause you know theres nothing else to do in this town on a week night. So we went to Starbucks to see Matt and talk to him for a little while. While we were talking to him this older guy walks up to us and asks us if we know where any good bands play at like bars or so. We told him about the Spot and Ricochet. Then we got to talking about different things and this guy mentioned something about Palatka and i got all excitied because that is where i used to live and its a very small town. So he was asking me if i knew certain people and whatnot.. It was pretty exciting! 

Lynds i know its going to be alright someday but i want it to be with him regardless. And thats how it will always be. 

Tonight is practice night. YeAH! I cant wait till we get to tumble tonight cause im so excitied that i got my backhand spring back tuck. and my standing back tuck! and SAM you are going to learn how to do a backhand spring like it or not! lol"

"event","I dont know what to do anymore. I was thinking today and wondering why im so hung up on him. I mean he is the one who decided he wanted to not be whatever we were. He is also the one who pursued the whole liking deal. i dont know. im so lost right now. i wish everything could go back to the way it was. I understand how Sam feels with the whole never feeling that way again. Its hard cause i know anytime something or someone does something it always reminds me of him in someway. its weird how he can have so much control over the feeling i used to be able to control. He doesnt even know hes had this effect on me. My new theory is that it kinda seems as if things might be going back to the way they were. in a way. He did call Sam last week out of the blue to see if she was at Mc D's cause he used to always stop by to say hi to her on Wednesdays. and then thursday he went through Oasis to say hi to Lynds just like he used to. Maybe one of these days it will be my turn to see him again. Maybe. 


I miss you, miss you so bad
I don't forget you, oh it's so sad
I hope you can hear me
I remember it clearly

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same 
Slipped Away-- Avril Lavigne



You were everything, everything that I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
And all the memories, so close to me, just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending
My Happy Ending-- AL"

Undream the dreams that we both shared
Unfeel the feelin' that you cared

Unlove me
Unmake all the memories I can't forget
Unlove me
Let my go back to the way I was before we met
Back to the day when I was strong
When it wasn't sad to be alone
When I was happy-go-lucky

To hold you and feel my heart melt
Show me a little mercy and unlove me
Unlove me
Untie all the strings between you heart and mine
Unlove me 
But do it real slow, so I don't have to lose you all at one

Before you pack your bags and leave
One thing I wish you'd do for me
Take a little time to just unlove me

I called off work on Sunday cause i wasnt liking the idea that my friends were 4wheeling and i was going to be working.. so i called off work plain and simple. I had a lot of fun for the few hours that i was at Felda. I went around on a bike that could go completely under water. it was great! and now the guys want to put a snorkel on my bike! yeah!! then i can go swimming with my bike! i love it! 

so about HIM yeah lynds def called him last week and he has yet to call her back.. then a few days ago Sam and I both called him and he has yet to call us back.. i dont know what his deal is but he needs to get over it and stop avoiding us. plain and simple. I wish that things could at least go some what back to they way it used to be. cause i had so much fun being around him. Just like me and Lynds where talking about one day.. the guys that we liked could be like outside and we would be inside and yet still be completely happy just because they were there. I miss sitting there with him at Lynds' house watching him fish. One time when i was sitting out there it was so funny cause he was like will you bite my hook cause then it will be the best catch ever. Yeah well what happened to that? i guess i wasnt the best catch."

Wiped the sleep from my eyes
Found a new day dawning
And suddenly I realize
You're gone

Tell me I was dreaming
That you didn't leave me here to cry
You didn't say you don't love me anymore
And it was just my imagination telling lies
Tell me that you didn't say goodbye

Maybe he will its only the 2nd day of this week there is still time. 

Lynds i def think you should call Brian when she leaves. Just so you know how his reaction is towards you. but i would give like a couple of months to go by before you do your master plan. 

Some day they will wake up and see what they HAD.. isnt that how it always works. right!? 

Some days its weird cause like for example i'll be at practice and for some odd reason i feel like after practice ill be calling him to see if they are at the apartment or at the parking garage and then we will all go and hang out and he'll be there and ill be happy. but then i realize thats not how its going to go and that is all in the past. Reality sucks. 

So guys about that time machine. we really need to get on to that. get the ball rolling... i say we will go back far enough to where all 3 of us is happy."

"event","So today Lynds calls me and says that she needs me to bring her something to her at work and i was like okay? and then she says that she needs cat food... then i was really confused and i asked her why.. and she says that she is hungry.. and im like maybe i didnt hear her right and she needs something else. but then she tells me that she found a baby kitty!!! See Lynds, Sam and I have two other kittens that are brother and sister and this new kitten looks just like Rebel and Dixie... so we have to keep her! We named her Tracy Birmingham... Tracy for short..lol  After i asked Sam on the phone if we should call her that and shes like yeah... then Sam calls back like 2secs later and says that Paint Me a Birmingham is playing on the Radio.. so right there is a sign that it is a good name. 

the baby is sleeping right now.. how cute!

Then i realize it pretty much sucks that its pretty much over with friendship and everything. oh wait i forgot until he FEELS like talking to me because shes not around. thats always fun. Next time he calls im going to ask him if hes calling me now because shes not around even though i know he'll say no thats not how it is.

"event","so i was watching MTV this morn and Ushers new video came on, Burn, and yeah i listened to it closely for the words... BECAUSE the last time i hung out with Derek. Me, him and Jacob went to Target and we were looking at the CDs and i saw Ushers new cd and i was said that i liked his new song.. and Derek was like ohh you need to listen to Burn its a really good song... well listening to the song today i wonder if he was directing teh song to me...

so guys tell me what you think about that?!

[Intro]
I don't understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby
I ain't happy baby
Plus theres so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you do
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
You know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Verse 2]
Sendin' pictures I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
Cause the feelin ain't the same 
find myself
Callin' her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't comin back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back
Ooo ooo ooo ooooh
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my booo
You've been gone for too long
It's been e-leven days, um-teen hours
Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you do
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
You know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Bridge]
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh)
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)

[Breakdown]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?)
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh

So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' till you return

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you do
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
You know that it's through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn"

so yeah Derek has never called me or e-mailed me back.. i dont want to say this but he probably doesnt want to talk to me or cares about me... i wish he did but i dont think thats the way its going... maybe in a lifetime of a year he might want to talk to me.. i dont understand why he doesnt because its not like we ever argued or anything... see it doesnt make SENSE! ahhh i hate boys. im angry now! he just doesnt know! 

so im done with that! lets see happy notes... hmm i dont have to many right now! ahhh....

So yeah Christina is trying to get me to meet this guy that works down in mens with her b/f and i was like uhh? sure? and i told her that im always up for meeting new friends but hooking up? not so much on that. no one understands the way i work.. i dont even think i understand it soemtimes. but hey thats the way i am. so deal. I just want everyone to be happy again. 

The power of 3 will always be together no matter what is thrown in front of us. wether it be a conflict or happiness. we can make it girls! i <font color=""#ff0000"">LOVE</font> my pals. 

remember:
if you feel the need to give HOPE a break in your heart, then i will continue on for you to keep HOPE alive and when you feel the need to give HOPE a home again it will be here for you to take back...

you said you were all alone
give me one more chance
to prove myself to you
all the little things that i long to do
...(when you run away)
would you trade the course
...(you said that you'd be)
so that i could hold you
...(coming out my front porch)
would it all go away
...(just to see me)
and my heart is breaking
would you hear me baby
as the tears are longing
for what it used to be"

"event","Lost- Becca Woolf

You look at me and ask, well, ""Why is she so sad?""
She won't tell you that she lost the only love she ever had.
She won't tell you that he loved her and his love was but a lie.
She won't tell you how she waits with desperation in her eye.
She won't tell you that she had him and she threw his love away.
She won't tell you if you ask her, she has nothing left to say.
So don't look at me and ask why she's sitting all alone.
She's trying to forget him, live her life and just move on.
And what she cannot tell you if you ask her why she's sad.
Is she feels like she has lost the only love she ever had.

Where's My Heart?
A Ballard

I lost it not so long ago,
I wait for its return,
The heart in which from in its depths, 
My passion used to burn.

And it rumbled up inside me, 
Before i even knew,
I let it fly away from me, 
And hide inside of you.

I swear to God i will find it, 
And love again will i.
To live a life without a heart, 
I think i'd rather die.

And when i see you laughing, 
I wonder if you know
That though it's been so very long, 
I haven't let you go.

And still i lie here crying,
With no heart to call my own, 
Cause i lost it with my sanity, 
The minute you were gone.

All i ask of you is simple, 
To set my spirit free, 
To find my old and broken heart, 
And give it back to me.


The Letter I'll Never Send- Rebecca Scida

The letter i'll never send
Would calmly as you why
You broke my heart in two
And told my love good-bye.

If i ever sent this letter 
It would sweetly state
You tangled up your destiny
And interrupted fate.

The letter i will not write
Would casually inquire
How can you live without me---
I was your one desire.

If you recieved this letter
It would politely say
You need me in your life now
You can't go on this way.

The letter ill never send
Would then be briskly signed 
""Your one and only Love""
You know--- the one you left behind.

Why they are friends- Kristy Glassen

Because... they smile.
Because... they understand just by looking into your eyes.
Because... they finish your sentences and know what you like.
Because... they know you better than you know yourself.
Because... with them you aren't afraid to be yourself.
Because... you can say something stupid or expose your deepest secrets to them.
Because... everything you do together becomes a memory.
Because... you don't need to do something specical to have fun... fun just happens.
Because... you don't need to explain anything... they just know.
Because... they tell you the truth, no matter how much you'd rather not hear it.
Because... they would do anything for you and get you out of trouble.
Because... they make you laugh harder than anyone.
Because... they are not afraid to put themselves on the line for you.
Because... you can trust them.
Because... they believe in your dreams, no matter how silly they may seem.
Because... they dry your tears.
Because... you are good enough when you are with them.
Because... they love you for who you really are.
Thats why they are friends.

Remember Me? - Ann Landers

 My name is Gossip.
 I have no respect for justice.
 I maim without killing. I break hearts and ruin lives.
 I am cunning, malicious and gather strength with age.
 The more i am quoted, the more i am believed.
 I flourish at every level of society.
 My victims are helpless. They cannot protect themselves against me because i have no name or face.
 To track me down is impossible. The harder you try, the more elusive i become.
 I am nobody's friend.
 Once i tarnish a reputationm it is never the same.
 I topple governments and wreck marriages. I ruin careers and cause sleepless nights, heartaches and indigestion. I spwan suspicion and generate grief. I make innocent people cry in their pillows. Even my name hisses.
 I am called GOSSIP. Office gossip--Shop gossip--Party gossip--Telephone gossip. I make headlines and headaches. REMEMBER, before you repeat a story, ask yourself: is it true? Is it fair? Is it necessary?? If not, do not repeat it. KEEP QUIET. 
 GREAT minds discuss ideas... Average minds discuss events... Shallow minds discuss people.. Which are you?"

"event","I just want to talk to him and ask him if there will ever be a chance with us getting together. but i really dont know how to go about doing that.. cause ive never been in this situation. now that im moving it wont be till like 2-3 years that i would be able to be with him.. unless for some odd reason he comes to his senses and realizes that im here for him and he moves to gainesville or some other way of being together. but i do know that the moving to gainesville is just a wish i would have. who knows? i guess like everyone says only time can tell. 

sometimes it feels as if time moves so slow but yet so fast.


i talked to Ryan today and he basically told me that i just have to give it time. cause guys sometimes need to just not have a relationship but be with girls.. which i guess if for some odd reason me and derek do ever get together i'll be glad he got this out of his system. but i dont know. the only thing i do know is that i want him and my feelings are strong whether that want to be seen or not. 

There had to of been something there at one point on his side cause he was the one who persued the whole liking deal.  which im thankful that he did cause i would have just gone on being friends with him and nothing more. and i would have missed out on the times that we shared together. peaceful times. 

why."

He doesnt realize what hes done to me... i mean yes i know im young and i know i have done half of the things most people my age have done... but i have had the chances to be more liek people my age.. which im not saying its a bad thing what they do cause its not.. i myself just dont run that way... i dont know why and probably will never understand why i am the way i am.. sometimes i wish that i had gone out with guys in my middle school years and go through all of the drama but back then i looked at it the way i do now. if im going to be with someone then i wanna feel thats its going to last.. i dont want a 2 week deal.. i did that and it left no impact in my life. Derek he was different from the rest of the guys that have came onto me... i didnt feel like i was just there because he wanted some girl and i happened to come his way... he made me feel like i belonged.. i felt comfortable around him and i liked that..and yes i was scared and still am.. i never EVER let a guy i like get to me. NEVER! but he did. i mean i just talked to him and told him that im most likely moving and hes liek are you positive? and i was like yeah... it sounded like he cared... and hes like it doesnt sound like your too happy about it and i was like well i am but its going to be hard leaving a few things behind. and he was in the middle of doing something so i told him  that i would let him go and i told him to please call me back later and he said that he would... i really hope he does. at the end of our convo i was crying... how can he have this much of an affect on me! THE ONLY GUY FOR ME IS HIM!"

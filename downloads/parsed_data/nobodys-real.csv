What do you think happens after you die? Havent decided that one quite yet. 

Do you believe in heaven? sometimes 

Do you believe in hell? sometimes 

Do you think you will be judged after you die? i hope not 

How many people would attend your funeral? dont know.. a few, im sure 

Would you rather that people cry or laugh at your funeral? whateve is going to help them get over it i guess. 

What's better? A shot in the head or downing pills? um.. pills. 

What should be written on your tombstone? i dont know. havent thought about that one. something nice about me. lol 

Would you rather die childless or divorced? neither.. since im not going to have to worry about either one... but if i had to pick.. id say childless. 

Do you want to die in the morning, afternoon, or night? whenever im asleep.. so night.. unless its during a nap.. lol 

If you had a million dollars to leave, who would you leave it to? i would split ip up between my living relatives.. and that special someone if i had one at the time.. 

What kind of flowers do you want at your funeral? gardenia, iris, magnolia, and some others that i cant think of right now. 

On your deathbed, which moment will you most remember? hopefully one that i have yet to make. 

Have you ever watched someone die? my baby... (a cat..i had her from the time i was 5 till 19.. she waited for me to come home from work.) 

What's the most gruesome death you can imagine?  

How often do you think about death? depends on my mood. lol 

Is fear of dying your number one fear? no

Do you consider life short or long? too short 

Do you think you have a soul? sometimes i wonder 

Assisted suicide for a terminally ill person is: fine by me. id want to do it if i was suffering so bad and i was gonna die any minute anyways... stop the misery already. 

If you were cremated, where would you like your ashes? i dont know.. something really cool.. like being shot into space.. or putting my ashes in a mold that goes on the bottom of the sea to rebuild reefs. i saw this show.. they really do that. or scattered anywhere in alaska..

Would you choose to be immortal, if you could be? yes.. but only if i could die when i chose to.. like no one could kill me but i knew the only way.. or something to that effect. cause you know it starts sucking really bad after a while. :)

<h2>Your Erogenous Zone Is Your Neck</h2>
You're particularly sensitive to kisses on your neck<br>
But you don't mind a hickie every now and then either<br>
Ask your partner to kiss right behind your ear<br>
Because chances are, that's the most sensitive spot on your body

"event","I will be starting my back piece by the end of summer... !!! I am SOOO excited!
I talked to Jason(Hammers' guy)last Tues.. not this week.. but last. And he said that what I want will take about 20 hours total, and he charges 50 an hour. So all I have to do is save up 200, and then go in for my outline.. :) He said that will take about 3 to 4 hours... so yeah. I am so freaking excited I can barely stand it.
I need to figure out a way to make some kind of border around my other tats on my bak.. cause where they are is perfect for what I want to do.. space-wise.. now there wont be a way to blend them into the big one.. so I have to separate them.. any ideas, please dont hesitate to let me know. But I am going to be getting wings.. and they will pretty much cover the rest of my back. It wont have any color.. except shading. well, im thinking about putting a VERY little bit of color on the bottom part.. but I dont know. But what Im gonna do is.. the top part is going to be all feathery and pretty.. just shading.. then about a quarter of the way down or so, they will start transforming.. into leathery gargoyle style wings.. with the pointed claws on the end.. and mid way.. randomly.. i will have him put feathers wafting down.. all will be great detail, and im thinking of doing like a red or something for parts of the shading on the leathery part.. It hasnt been drawn up yet.. but Im sure itll all come together nicely. :) See, I used to love the yinyang... when i was in jr high.. but now.. it doesnt appeal to me. but the thoery still does.. so this is kinda sorta like that. bsaically showing 2 sides.. and all that. i dont want to get to philosophical here, but you get the idea. :) Yah.. oh and i absolutely LOVE my new job!!! omg. kbye."

"event","So, I met this really cool guy.. and we've become fast friends. Well, he is planning a trip to Alaska... for a month. He wants to camp and hunt. Live off the land. And he invited me to come along. Ok. Once in a lifetime chance here. He told me all the money I need to save is to cover bills for the month we'll be gone. Brad already gave me his ok. Of course I'll have to save way more than for the bills, I'd have to do some major shopping, and I'd want to pay for gas and food, and I'm not going to make him pay for my room. I can pay for my own, no reason for him to pay for two( he plans on driving up.. maybe I can talk him into going up the PCH, get 2 dreams out of the way in one shot). This would be a dream come true for me, and I'd be with someone who knows what they're doing out in the middle of nowhere. And I told him I don't want to hunt, that I'd hold down the camp. So I'll be able to write in my journal, take pictures, hike around. And think of all that weight I'd lose. lol, AND I'd be getting a workout every day, with all the walking around, and climbing I'd be doing. Plus, there won't be any convienance stores, no junk food. This sounds more and more awesome the more I think about it. But I don't know if it will really happen. It sure is nice to think about though. I don't know what I'm going to do."

I just wish that everything would fucking be ok and stay that way. Maybe it has nothing to do with me.. but I think it does. Did I get an I love you or a kiss before he left today? no. I didnt even get a kiss hello last night, or an I love you or anything before bed. Well, thats wonderful. Something happened in his head yesterday.. at some point. I feel like Im going to throw up. I hate this not knowing. I asked what was wrong. he said it was irrelevant. I told him I made an appt. He said that was fine,  but acted like he didnt care. WHAT HAPPENED?!? Things were going so good. I dont get it. I want things to work, but Im getting to the point where I DONT CARE ANYMORE either. This whole thing doesnt even phase him. I dont think he ever really loved me the way he said he did. Im going to see how things go for a little bit longer.. we have our appt for the 14th. so well see how that goes. i think ill wait a week afterward. and if things arent better.... i cant do this to myself anymore. i want so bad to be with him, and for things to work. but i need him to make an effort as well. and i dont feel like he even cares. he says he does.. and maybe its just cause i had a bad day yesterday too.. aside from him. maybe he did too, but why wouldnt he kiss me goodbye? i dont know. i fucking hate my life right now. it needs to improve quickly."

Some examples of the Unicorn Form are Eve<br>(Christian) and Pandora (Greek).
The Unicorn is associated with the concept of<br>innocence, the number 3, and the element of<br>water.
Her sign is the twilight sun.

As a member of Form 3, you are a curious<br>individual.  You are drawn to new things and<br>become fascinated with ideas you've never come<br>in contact with before.  Some people may say<br>you are too nosey, but it's only because you<br>like getting to the bottom of things and<br>solving them.

I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have
All of me

You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts
My once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away
All the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have
All of me

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have
All of me

i was talking to my mom today about the nikon d200. it's a ridiculously large amount of money to invest in a hobbie that's equipment upgrades every few months, but i've never wanted anything so bad. my mom said she'd talk it out with me after i get my next paycheck. my mom is amazingly supportive about everything ever.  especially because i know she doesn't exactly have that much money to give me.
there's a $400 employee discount, but that's only valid after you've been working 90 days. i want to ask lee or morely to buy it for me, but i have a weird feeling about doing that. even though i'll probably do it anyway.  i hope.
tonight i tore apart shitty polaroid pictures, scratched the emultion, and called them self portraits. it's how i have fun.
i'm very tired and i'll probably pass out trying to read ""in cold blood"" again."

would you trail through poison ivy with me, or read me a book while i'm passed out drunk in your bed? no? well that's why she's my best friend
i'm sitting in a recliner chair in front of my computer. a recliner. it leans back. it's pretty much the american way. might i add that i didn't put this chair here. 
today at work i pretty much chopped my pointer finger in half while cutting negatives. i bled a whole fucking lot. i wonder if i get worker's comp for that. i hate my boss so much.
i'm walking on sunshine, hey?"

i always get a new journal after i pass the ""more than two months"" mark. it's weird, because i always feel ashamed of my thoughts from old journals. it's not that i'm wishy washy with my opinions, it's just that i'm constantly changing my mind. oh well.
i have 20 days until school, give or take. i still have to do my newspaper assignment and finish ""in cold blood"", which is supposed to be an amazing read. 
yesterday i bought a circular polarizer filter at work, and talked about the dictatorship that is ritz camera with my coworkers. i have fun though. i have fun."

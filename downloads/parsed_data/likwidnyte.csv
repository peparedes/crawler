"event","So, I got this totally cool package today.

V2 changed distributors sometime around the beginning of the year. Now they're distributed through WEA.

Their biggest act, by far, is of course, The White Stripes.

So, as a welcome package, they sent us college reps this super cool White Stripes t-shirt (in our sizes, because they actually asked!), and even cooler, this 1999-2005 Retrospective double-disc album featuring all their big songs and videos that was essentially only distributed to us and very few stores. 

Yayness.

NYC is shaping up to be really cool, I now have a couple of people looking out for all the awesome shows that are happening during the time we'll be out there. Hopefully I can swing it to where there's a couple nights with free meals and drinks and shows!

Yayness."

"event","I've decided today that I'm the uncool friend. This isn't a negative reflection on myself, because in all reality, I've become pretty estranged to the idea of having very close friends, and more adapted to having very casual friends. I think this is due to time restraints for the most part, because really, even long time friends are hard to keep up to date with. Though, I think in part a bit of it can be attributed to unequal efforts to maintain a relationship...but that's a whole different aspect that's relatively unimportant.

In other words, by saying I'm the ""uncool friend"" I'm not necessarily upset about this, but of course, it's not something I wear as a badge, it just seems to fit with the people I've met my entire life...though, sorta with the exception of one friend in particular (y'all can, perhaps, try to decide who that is).

So here's what I mean...by being the ""uncool friend"" I'm someone whos more stable and reliable, despite the fact that I may not be able to be there all the time, I can always be there by phone or e-mail. However, because, perhaps, my other friends aren't considered by another friend to be anyone worth that friend knowing, and because I don't have a particularly sexy/adventurous/interesting lifestyle, or one that I can share with large groups of people, I can't provide much for any type of striver. 

People, myself included, tend to navigate toward people who through knowing will provide some sort of benefit, whether it be a connection to that persons group of friends, a certain status, and of course, the overall association with that person. 

I don't really have friends who are ridiculously interesting (really, not meant to be offensive in the least despite how offensive it may seem, and really more in relation to how my other friends view them consciously or not), hold any sort of status that any other friend of mine hopes to strive toward, and none of my friends find any real benefit behind associating with any of my friends.

Not that that's a bad thing in the least, but it places me in the ""uncool friend"" department, the department wherein no one really has any beneficial reason to be associated with me.

Now, I will say, though, that I tend to navigate away from the typical ""cool friend"" type of person. Navigate away from people who have status, or because of my association with them it may make me *that* much cooler. People like that always seemed to try too hard to be something better than anyone else, and I really only end up making fun of them.

At times, however, my status flips. Sadly, though, it's only at times that people are being more opportunist. Like I said above, there's a whole side of me that I can't really share with much of anyone besides Michael. Since coming into this lifestyle, I've had renewed interest into friendships with me coming from many, many avenues, but in very few avenues have I actually offered to include people into that grouping, and only then, have there been few times wherein it wasn't something that I sort of regretted, only because for a short time it resulted in renewed interest in me, as a friend, because of a service, essentially, that I could provide.

I don't know where else I wanted to go with that, or even why I would lay around this evening watching Law & Order: SVU and all of a sudden start writing about this, but alas, here I am. 

I can't wait to move away with Michael and, for the most part, start a completely new life with a new set of opportunists and strivers.

I will say, though, that I'm drawn to write about this because I'm happy I understand this. It's taken quite a long time, and a lot of stress on my behalf. For quite some time now, I considered why many of the relationships I've had died, or became quite casual. Looking back at the times that those relationships were perhaps the strongest, there was still a large part of the relationship I couldn't provide, a part that gave the other person a position to socially succeed through my connections. Instead, I was then, and still happily remain, just *there*"

"event","I ran across a certain persons profile on Connexion.org just now...sort of realize I still have somewhat of a soft spot for him. Then again, the second I thought about that, I remembered that he didn't really turn me on sexually..I mean, not that I didn't get off...he just didnt do that *undescribable* thing for me that really made me into it for more than just an orgasm. At the time, he was able to fool around, but freaked out by the idea of fucking, which resulted in perhaps the most awkward sexual experiance I've ever had (but then, it's not all his fault, because a hot police office was the one who made it the most awkward when he almost arrested us).

Then there's the whole aspect of pretention. I read his profile and got bored a minute in. He likes to misuse words, and argue that he isn't. He doesn't use the correct punctuation, but argues that he meant it. Just those two facts alone make him ridiculously, stupidly, pretentious, and the attitude, motives, and personality that goes behind that would make it difficult for me to ever spend more than 30 minutes with again. 

Plus, he always needed to be the center of attention...and well, when I was smitten I didn't mind yielding it to him, but alas, once I grew balls, I fought.

Perhaps the most interesting thing about him these days is that his boyfriend says they're ""in a committed relationship"" and he says they're ""in an open relationship"" and solicits ""the occasional rough and tumble with (a) stranger(s)."" Not that I for a second criticize someone who's in an open relationship, or someone who sleeps around, but I find the two different views, and the fact that this particular person is either ""popular"" or (and from history, what I'd be more inclined to believe) wants people to think he's ""popular"" so he can feel he's a part of some ideal being he's created himself to be. 

Strange, what kind of thoughts can run through a persons head during a brief surf across a persons profile.

The more and more I think of it, there seems to be some sort of obsession among people my age and so with online communication. I was talking to my mother online yesterday during class and it donned on me. We have online communities (myspace) to create our social identity, even cultural specific online communities to create a social identity within the culture we belong, weblogs/journals to create our individual identity, online chat programs (AIM, Yahoo!) and e-mail for everyday communication with people. We can get our news faster, more diverse, and in greater quantity online, we can conduct full relationships with people we have only met through the internet. We can hold business meetings through e-mail, chatrooms, or even webcams. We can have business relationships executed 100% over the internet, and keep in touch with more people all at the tip of your fingers. 

It's amazing what this has all come to, and yet, we haven't even begun to realize just what we can do.

Really, though, all I'm trying to say is Facebook me."

Public Eye
by Cara DeGette 


Palmer High School students Haley Crump and Brett Schager got in big trouble when, using sidewalk chalk on the public sidewalk outside the school, they advertised a Gay-Straight Alliance student club meeting. 
Photo By Bruce Elliott 
This school year has provided powerful educational opportunities for Haley Crump, Brett Schager and the more than 30 current members of the Palmer High School Gay-Straight Alliance. 
Theyve learned how to organize. Theyve learned how to fight for justice, and the importance of standing up for their rights. Theyve learned just how petty and hostile their school leaders can be. 

Its too bad these lessons came at the expense of at least five other clubs at Palmer -- and an unknown number of now-defunct student groups at other D-11 high schools -- that were victimized by the districts refusal to recognize a club designed to promote tolerance and respect. 

And its too bad for taxpayers that this proved to be one whopper of an expensive lesson. 

Last week, as its final official action, the outgoing school board settled a two-year-old lawsuit, agreeing to recognize the Gay-Straight Alliance as a full-fledged student club at Palmer. To say the district previously was aggressive in its efforts to reduce the GSA, as well as other student groups, to second-class stature is putting it mildly. 

During the battle, the district completely overhauled its policy on student clubs, creating a system in which only those with direct ties to the school curriculum would be ""officially"" recognized. Eleven others, including the GSA, the Book Club, the Film Club, the Unified Sports Team, the Dance/Drill Team and Interact, a volunteer community service organization, were allowed to meet, but were denied access to the public address system to announce meeting times and places. They were denied access to school equipment and resources. They were denied recognition in the school yearbook. 

How severely did this maneuver cripple these clubs? Well, of the six listed above, only the Gay-Straight Alliance has survived. The others since have disbanded, according to Palmer principal Tom Kelly. 

Now, just like that, all student clubs have been restored to full status. And right about now, you may be wondering: Just what were D-11 administrators thinking by wreaking such havoc? Well, they werent thinking, they were reacting. Reacting to a feared backlash by wingnuts who might get worked into a frenzy over the fact that the largest school district in the states second-largest city has a club where gay and straight students gather to dissect and debate one of the most talked-about issues of the day. 

As of press time, D-11 was unable to provide a total cost, much less a breakdown, of how much it spent trying to defend itself before throwing in the towel. However, as of March 31 -- eight months ago -- the district reported it had spent $250,000 on legal fees alone on the lawsuit. As part of the settlement, D-11 has agreed to pay another $90,000 in legal fees to the American Civil Liberties Union, which took the case on behalf of the students. 

In its press release announcing the settlement, D-11 mentioned neither the money spent nor the other student clubs sucker-punched out of existence by their parochial thinking. Instead, newly appointed Superintendent Sharon Thomas said this in a press release: ""We care about all our students and want to make District 11 a nurturing and supportive environment which promotes educational achievement for all students."" 

That's a far cry from just a couple of weeks ago, before the lawsuit was settled, when administrators and staff at Palmer demonstrated just how ""nurturing and supportive"" they felt toward members of the Gay-Straight Alliance. 

Given the difficulties they faced in advertising their club, GSA co-vice chairs Crump and Schager, with other members of the club, brainstormed an idea: They would write where and when they were meeting, in chalk, on the public sidewalks around and nearby the school. 

Administrators responded by yanking Schager out of that afternoon's GSA meeting and ordering him to the vice principal's office. In solidarity, Crump followed, as did a third member of the club. Facing a phalanx of angry administrators, staff and a security guard, the three were interrogated and verbally reprimanded. 

They were told the sidewalk chalk was a hazard and a potential liability; people might slip on it. They were told that non-students might read the advertisement and try to come to the club meeting, creating a safety risk. They were reminded that the district was in the middle of a lawsuit, and therefore, the sidewalk-chalk advertising was inappropriate. They were threatened, Crump says, with being charged with vandalism for writing in chalk on the public sidewalks. They were ordered outside to scrub off the chalk. 

They were, Crump reports, provided with a 10-gallon bucket of water and two brooms. Unable to lift it, Crump says she asked for a wagon to get the bucket outside. ""The security guard said he wasn't going to make it any easier for us,"" she says. ""It was intimidating."" 

The kids dragged out the bucket and swept the sidewalks clean. And yes, they were mad about it. Schager cites the district's official Student Code of Conduct and Discipline Handbook, in which the Board of Education claims it will not tolerate bullying of any kind, including ""any word, look, sign or act, or pattern of such behavior, that inflicts or threatens to inflict physical or emotional injury or discomfort."" 

Finally this week, the two teacher sponsors of the GSA were placed on administrative leave for undisclosed reasons. History teacher Fran Lindau confirmed that she and Anton Schulzki, who until Wednesday was the chair of the social studies department, have been placed on paid leave, though she declined to comment pending the outcome. 

Indeed, members of the Gay-Straight Alliance have gotten an education this year. What District 11 administrators have learned remains to be seen.

"event","So

Of the 40 some college reps I've gotten shout outs twice now since I started in June (or July?). When we give our two-week recaps my boss compiles them and services them to virtually everyone within Warner Music Group. They're all lumped together in an attachment, but she always has this section for College Rep Campaign of the Week and another for Creative College Rep Idea of the Week. I just got the first one this time around (Campaign of the week), and last time I got the Creative one. These shoutouts are in the body of the e-mail rather than as an attachment, so the likelihood of people noticing things that I'm doing is much higher! Yay. I feel special.

So last night, I stayed up until 5am working on a speech and then for some bizarre reason decided that I should try to sleep. One can't sleep for 3 hours because it does nothing for you unless it's a nap at the end of the day! Alas, I'm sitting in a boring ass class now, and have already given my speech which I rocked on bigtime. I hate it though, because that specific class I have over 100% in and I have 5 absences. Because of the 5th absence my grade gets lowered 1 letter grade. I am thinking of e-mailing the professor about her preoccupation with things that obviously don't make any difference. 

I'm ridiculously tired right now and have to get ready to head off to the bogus Music on the PC class I have, and the two crappy ones I have after that!

I'm finally going to be graduating....a year from now, hopefully. I either will have one normally full semester SP06 and one light semester FA06 or have a normal semester FA06 and a light semester SP07. It's taken me forever to get out of school, but alas, it will give me ample time to build relationships within WEA for future employment. While in all reality, I'd probably rather work with Atlantic, a job with WEA would be happily accepted.

"event","just found out a friend of mine is a total coke head. I went to chill with her at her work (a bar) and she showed me around. In the bathrooms (which are unisex, and it didn't quite click why she was so proud of the bathrooms until later) she showed me that the stall doors had, well, basically, as she described...coke shelves on them. As we were walking into the bathrooms some guy whispered in her ear. Then we went back to the bar, and shortly thereafter she ditched me for about 5 minutes wherein she most likely went and did coke (as she was headed to the bathroom). I had went to the bar all alone, and so was standing there like a schmuck. Of course, that meant I had to text all our mutual friends/acquaintances and ask if they knew about her habit...everyone seemed to know already, but said it wasn't their business to say something, which I understand, and agree with. I mean, yeah, here I am talking about it, but despite who some (the very few who know any of my friends) may think it is, you're prolly wrong...it was sort of out of left field for me.

Which brings me to the next thing...How did I not know this? Day in/day out I essentially pride myself on knowing people really well, generally speaking. I usually can figure out people really quickly. Of all things, how could I not figure this out? I mean, in hindsight, I may have only been around her one or two times that she's been coked out (though, I don't hang out with her that much, so it's prolly 75% of the time if not more), and I can think now of one specific instance where she was uber thrashed, but I thought she was just excited and happy (it was situational)....but I just have to wonder...how could I have missed this?"

Ricky Martin was on it.

He was there ""as a humanitarian"" who did this or that in some country and now we can see it on Oprah, and no he isn't pushing a record, and oh, yeah, he left the music industry for ""enlightenment"" and blah blah ""I'm Ricky Martin, I'm better than you, and I'll be the first to tell you"" ish.

Of course, like a week later, I hear that he's releasing an album. I felt lied to and manipulated and let down, for I had hoped there would be no more La Vida Loca er whatever, and alas there's a reprise. I wonder if Oprah is pissed that he used these ""humanitarian"" efforts to get himself back into the limelight again.

The song is catchy only because it's repetitive. Amerie's part is the best, most interesting. Dun like Fat Joe. Strange that there's one person from Capitol (Ricky), one from Sony (Amerie) and one from WEA (Fat Joe). How did he decide such a thing? Randomness like that is usually because the label wants the big artist to support the mini artists. Though, it was probably because Capitol owed Sony and WEA a big name artist to throw their new artist with for a collab. 

Why is this song so segmentated?

Why does he talk about tragedy over the seas in a pop song?

it's pop, not newsweek.

ps. iTunes will be availing itself for dvd-quality video downloads hopefully by the end of the year. That mean that by March we'll have the new iPod, capable of playing dvds. Wonder if iTunes will turn into iShows and allow people to dl movies and tv shows to play on your ipod."

"event","Okay, so I don't know how much more I can brag about this....but...

I now have an e-mail address @wmg.com 

How friggin' cool is that?

I feel like a freakin' nerd, but it's exciting to me.

So I got into an argument with this girl and Shmaulgreens. She's not just stupid, she's *STOOOOOPPPPIIIDDDD*

I don't hate her, I hate her vial stupidity. She's also really trashy, and obnoxious, and therefore, she's an open book for things to dis (I used ""dis"" but really, it's for lack of a better word) her on...which means I tend to say mean things to her.

Tonight before she left she wanted to make an employee purchase. So as she shops for her 20some things she needs, she places them one by one on my counter, and soon, it fills up. Customers are looking at me like I'm green for leaving milk sit out on my counter, and a few don't quite know if someone is in line before them. Finally she says she's done.

""Have you ever heard of a cart"" I say
""I didn't want to use a cart""
""I didn't want you to leave your crap sprawled across my counter either""
""Matt, don't start with me, I've had a hard day, I'm tired"" (everyone criticizes her lack of productivity because stooopid people don't get much done)
""Well, you didn't have to leave it all over the counter, customers are uncomfortable with that, and they've been looking at me like I'm an idiot, and it looks tacky.""
""Ugh Matt! I'm so sick of you, you're such an asshole.""
""Um, okei, I don't care, you could use a cart!""

So then she goes on about how I must hate women, about how she wants to slap me, that she'll wait until we're out of work and then she'll slap me (""Did you want to schedule that now, or wait until later"" I replied).

""You need to grow up Matt""
""You need to grow a brain"" (the only personal remark I made)

Then she says she's going to get her boyfriend here to kick my ass (""er, okei"" I say).

It was kind of funny. I love getting into arguments with stupid people because if you just use a string of multisyllabic words, they'll get fed up and fusterated with arguing with you that they start to say even more stupid things.

I just laughed at her, told my boss what happened, and we laughed at her.

I'm such an asshole.

She messed up a sign a couple of days ago by writing something on it, and I got pissed at her and told her off for doing that (keeping level headed, and telling her that I was only half joking). She offered to make a new sign, I told her she wouldn't know how to spell the words.

I was ragging on my boss for wearing shorts (he came in on his day off) and she said that if she was off work she would be wearing shorts. I told her that we're all glad she's working then.

Oh, to live my life. It's so easy being mean!

I'm going to hell."

"event","Testing...is this thing still on?

So, half of me said...""oh, you've been wanting to get back into online journaling for a while, perhaps this would give you a story to write about"" and the other half of me just wanted to brag.

Warner boss called me today to invite me to go out with them and the regional radio promoter who's here from LA for dinner, drinks, and Hot Hot Heat. Kind of fun, exciting, and the first time that I'd be seeing these people since I snagged the gig back in May. 

We went to this restaurant, with mediocre food, great deserts, superb margaritas, and my new vice...the mojito (that's how it's spelled, right?). They had amazing mojitos....not that I had anything to compare it to, given that I had never had one before, but alas, from what I think I know, they have rum in them, and I'm an avid anti-rum type (thank you high school days...*shivers*). It tasted like yummy mint-lime water....could totally get myself screwed with them, as there isn't the slightest hint of alcohol in them, but I saw them being made, and yeah, they're loaded. A friend of mine from school (who's vacating his position, which left it open for me (okei, I know this is a parentheses inside of a parentheses, but I'll explain more about this subject later when I decide I may want to write a million words ranting and raving about the ethics of competitiveness) to take over) was also at this little get together. Unsure, I texted him in the midst of it all to ask if they flip the bill. Told him to just nod my way. He nodded, they paid. Drinks and all on the profits from the poor fledgling artists out there who aren't seeing half of what they're worth show up in their pockets. How Colorado Rock Star is that? (If only I had known that, as Ron obviously did, before we sat down, as I had already purchased two margaritas for myself, but the mojito was still free!). So we talk talk talk. Mr. Bossman knows my strange affinity for Madame M, he even e-mailed me an interview she did on The View (those women are fukkin' scary as hell, they tension itself while watching it deserves a few cigarettes just to calm down). Well...who would have an album coming out this fall? None other than the woman herself! What record label is she signed with? The same one I just so happen to be working with (the angels in heaven sing everytime I mention this...you can hear them if you try hard enough). 

So, we've now wasted our time that we would have had to stand through some nausiating opening acts, and decide to head down towards the show.

So I work with Warner labels, there is a fukkin 16 year old kid who works with Warner Bros. He's chillin' with us, and hooks me up with both the Esthero and Damien Rice samplers. Mr Bossman swipes them from me to see what they were after the show, and started talking to the Radio guy about where a good place to drop these would be...I mentioned that Damien Rice would be good at a Tori Amos show (I promise, I'm getting somewhere with this). They both applauded the idea in passing, and mentioned that we have the opening act for the second leg of her tour, and that she's expected to be at Red Rocks in September....he assured me we'd prolly be getting tickets to it...and as we were talking about this while waiting to meet Hot Hot Heat, I can now begin to try to work an m/g with Tori in September (the angels sing at this point too). Perhaps I'll finally get my chance to try to secure myself a position with John Witherspoon and Chelsea Laird with The Bridge Entertainment Group (Tori's company).

So eventually Hot Hot Heat comes out to meet up with us, they're all pretty decent guys. The bassist (I believe) talks with this girl and me for a while, and then I joined in to the convo with the lead singer, the radio guy, and this chick from Tower. The lead singer was quite friendly and talkative, they all were, really. Pretty nice guys. That lasted about 30 mins and off we went.

I should be getting my first uber cool package of shwag hopefully manana.

Party of 40 walks in from out of the blue. Yes, 40. 

they're busy up front, so I obviously have to take them

manager is at the bank.

I get their orders, it's cooking, some of it's starting to come up before I finish taking all the orders.

I, for some reason, need to find out where every single salt and pepper shaker for the back room is.

I have to roll 40 pieces of silver, drink tables and give them their food

I have a method for working this, it would have worked perfectly.

Manager comes back from bank starts telling people what she wants them to do, 

I ask her politely to let me do my job, that I have a method for what I am doing and that she is screwing it up

""I'm your boss I'll tell you what i want you to do""

""Fine then, go ahead and finsh the party"" (only maybe 6 were fully taken care of...that's 6 of 40)

She threatens to send me home, but wants me to finish this party first. 

""You want me to do you a favor when you're just going to send me home?""

She walks away. 

Comes back and tries to meddle some more.

Tells me that she doesn't need to hear my mouth (even though I hadn't said one cuss word, and I feel I was respectful. Even when I told her that she was messing things up I was overly respectful...I'll never bite the hand that feeds me unless it slaps me).

She reitterates that she's the boss, and that I have to listen to her.

I tell her that if she wants to then she can go ahead and take the party.

She treats it like a challenge with the banal ""you don't think I can?"" retort.

I walked out.

Clinton didn't apologize for not intervening in the genocide in Rwanda.

Bush didn't apologize for being brain dead about Sept. 11th.

They'll spin their answers any which way but sorry.

I have a business idea that I need to start researching and getting underway. It's definately a business that could be up and running within a year, and finace me well enough that I wouldn't have to work outside of the business, and perhaps Mike wouldn't either, not to mention possible business partners wouldn't have to work either. In many ways, I think this is a failproof plan because it's something that doesn't happen, and it wouldn't really require any sort of investment, meaning that there would be a great deal of immediate profit, and the overhead for running the company would consume 10% of profits at the extreme max.

Please people, make sure that you vote. Since there's enough time between now and when we vote, do make sure that you research your candidate wisely.

If you want a gazillion reasons as to why you should vote for Kerry, please, just simply e-mail me. I will give you more than just personal opinion on the matter. I promise."

"event","was hot, and I was outside all day....today was the first day of peoples fair.

Here's the fundamental truth I think I learned about myself today:

As far as peers, I get along with everyone..

As far as superiors/bosses, I get along with at the beginning, gain their trust, and then change things around to be the way I want them...sorta undermining their authority, which in turn makes them hate me, however, not in a way that they could actually admit because I'm so deeply involved, or too obviously good at what I do that they can't find a legit reson to fire me.

As far as peers, if i don't trust you, you've let me down, or I've let go of a situation trusting that you will take hold and successfully bring the task to completion and you don't...well then, instead of telling you to your face, I stab you in the back something fierce. I've gotten someone a C in a class, fired, and totally blacklisted (three people actually...in that order) because of this reason.

It's why I never admit that I'm a ""nice"" person. I don't think I am, I think I'm reserved.

I drank alcohol all day long. This girl lindsay somehow scored us two VIP passes which allows us to get free beer and food. 

I spent pretty much all day with Lindsay today...she's 90% the girl version of me...it's wierd.

Today was, however, about the worst day on earth for me. Last night I was at harry potter when I found out (well, not until afterward, but I was in the movie at the time of the call) that the table we were going to have for today sorta fell through because the person couldn't get it. Thank God Almighty that Mike was willing to help out in the situation. So everything got handled, in some way. Then this morning, I was headed off to K-Mart to get some things, Mike called, he was getting the table from his parents, needed bungee cords that we had at home, so I headed home, which was when I first realized it. As I was heading over to Mike's parents house, I was thankful enough that I was able to get to the Safeway parking lot because I had already stalled once. I was severly overheated. This was only 8:30am. I was then running late. So, we transferred everything to Mike's parent's car and he dropped me off with everything because he's one of the most selfless people I know. It's why I love him more than he knows.

everything was mildy spiffy after that, especially once I started drinking."

I still think that Jasmine could have some sort of career too. Mike and I were just talking about this... Ashanti doesn't have a voice, and she has a career...how did she start it? Hooks. Jasmine could easily start a career with hook singing. Shit, for that matter, Jennifer Lopez doesn't have a voice, and yet she's sold millions and after that she decided to do lame hooks for a pretty lame rapper (ja rule).

For Diana, if I were the exec for RCA I would secure some songs from Diane Warren and get her a few powerhouse ballads...it's the best path for her career...especially with how long she can hold a note.

Fantasia's the shit, man. The shit."

"event","So, I have this thing. I've told Michael about it before, but I understand it's human nature to do it. When I fall asleep during something I hate being woken up. Some sort of defense mechanisim arises in me and I turn somewhat bitchy.

Though, I think my current bitchiness derrives itself from a specific factor that I am too inhibited to talk about here. It's not Michael, because I'd deal with that with him and it would be too uneventful in its aftermath to drudge up again here...at least concerning the miniscule problems we've had thus far in our relationship. 

At any rate it's sad to see someone I care about succumb to the same weaknesses time after time. There are few people in my life that I place on a pedistal (and yes, in many ways I consider that a weakness of myself, for I set myself up for failure in ways), and when these people fall off, it effects me more than I should let it, I suppose. I don't know, I don't know how to accurately explain this function in the inner workings of my brain. At the end of the day, I'm left screaming ""you're worth more, why can't you see that?""

The whole thing comes from my respect and love for the person, but at the same time, who am I to say such things? If I really love someone should I allow them to do as they feel? Though, I guess if I was in their shoes, I would see what was going on, only because I've been in similar situations, and I still place myself in these situations today. It's part of why I've tried to rid myself of acquaintences or temporary relationships. I seek relationships with people who I care about and trust that they reciprocate. That's not to say that every relationship I have is an absolutely poignantly tightly knit bond, because as many people do, I have relationships that serve their purpose as well (not to be misconstrued with having relationships with people I can use, unless it's in the workplace, in which I feel that unless there is a relationship before working with the person, it's a totally approvable use of a relationship because it can get you places you need to go). However, there is a fine line between having relationships with people that serve purposes and having relationships with people that are downright self-destructive. In the past I've had self-destructive relationships. I spent the majority of high school trying to involve myself in a more popular group of friends only to discover far too late that it was more mentally destructive than any sort of benifit. It took going through that to realize that some things aren't important.

I don't know where I'm going with this anymore, mostly because I wanna keep somewhat broad on the topic."

"event","There's this guy who sucks. He's a waste of time, in the perfect job that allows him to perform below any sort of acceptable level without getting in trouble and it's because he kisses ass to the managers. I've told Lil that I really didn't like him much and that I didn't trust him, and that his sense of humor annoys the shit out of me. She's seemingly good friends though. I told Phyllis, other manager, that I didn't trust him and blah blah blah. All the servers I work with know I severely detest this person and don't trust him.

Okay, so at work today....two tables had no tip. One table was a regular guy who leaves $3. I told my manager that two tables, right after each other had the tips taken off of them. I told her that logically it was this other server, given her heavy heroin addiction, but that my gut feeling was that it was this guy. She thought it was the drug addict. We got the bright idea of going to the office and taking advantage of the nice brand new camera system that was just put in. Messed around on the computer, and bam, found that the guy took the two tips. I was justified and justifiably exuberant. 

Moral of the story: This is the second person who's crossed my path at Denny's who I got fired. (hint)"

I know my application ""essay"" kicked ass, so maybe the two things were enough?

Yes, apparently it happened about 2 months ago. I don't know specifics. My dad said he told me. He didn't. 

""Where's Bonnie's motorcycle?""
""Wyoming""
He had said she was in Wyo but she commonly goes there over the weekend for family.
about 5 min later
""Where's the Dodge?""
""Wyoming""
""She took both?""
""Well yeah! She moved there""
SHOCK!
""You never said anything!""
""Yes I did!""
""Dad, would I have this smile,"" I point to my gaping smile ""if I had known before now?""
""...""
""I'm sorry, dad, I don't mean to laugh when you're sad""

"event","So, I think it's a pisser that iTunes is raising it's prices on some things. What's worse, though, is that Sony was one of their most stubborn labels, and they are making a number of their materials forced to be listed at $1.29 a song. However, lets not forget the fact that Sony just released their online store giving 500,000 songs for only $0.99.

What's cool about iTunes? I think it's through the end of May, but for the first time ever there are 45 singles, and 45 albums celebrating the 45 years of motown. EMI must be making a killing off this given that they just bought Gordy's entire masters catelogue and this seems to be the first thing that they've done with it. Gotta make back that almost $200 million they bought them for.

I think I've decided that once I finally finish everything with CAM Records (which is now extended through the fall semester, making it a full year I will have worked on it) that I'm going to start looking for a *job* job. Only locally, I need to finish my education. I figure, though, that I'll have 1 year of working on a label, and if we manage to produce and release an album by the end of that year, and I'll have a lot to write on a resume about.

Though, I will say, there are only 7 of us working for it this summer, and it's causing me super stress about how to maximize our time. We could blow it out of the water in a few months if we concentrate our efforts."

Kathryn: I feel like I need to say that we must remember that we live in a free country.
likwidnyte13: no we don't
likwidnyte13: and that's what infuriated me with Bush's q&a a couple of weeks ago
likwidnyte13: he kept saying we live in a free country
likwidnyte13: but while you may be free to do as you want
likwidnyte13: I have ammendments to the constitution that prohibit me from marrying 
likwidnyte13: I don't have an ammendment in the constituititon that prohibits employers from discriminating against me
likwidnyte13: If mike were to fall terminally ill, I would not be able to be at his deathbed
likwidnyte13: I'm discriminated against if I want to adopt one of the millions of children in foster care or orphanages in not only America but in the entire world
likwidnyte13: that, to me, isn't freedom
likwidnyte13: it's not freedom when the president goes on the televison and tells the country that marriage should be between a man and a woman, that just because I'm gay, I deserve less
likwidnyte13: the outright discrimination against homosexual people who make up 10% of the nations population, isn't freedom
Kathryn Parmar: Where else would you choose to live?
likwidnyte13: there are many ""westernized"" countries that allow for the things that this country prohibits me
likwidnyte13: Canada allows for it
likwidnyte13: most european countries allow for it
Kathryn Parmar: Why don't you strive to go somewhere else? You are young....why live your life hating that you aren't free to do the things you want?
Kathryn Parmar: I'll come visit.
likwidnyte13: because America is my home
likwidnyte13: why do I have to be chased out?
likwidnyte13: it's like saying ""Go back to Africa""
Kathryn Parmar: You don't.....but cut your stresses where you can. It's just food for thought. America IS your home....but why do you have to be forced to NOT be free?
Kathryn Parmar: No....I'm just saying that the battle may never be won.
Kathryn Parmar: Therefore....why bother.
Kathryn Parmar: Enjoy life instead.
likwidnyte13: why did Martin Luther King bother
Kathryn Parmar: Yet another thing that will never be equal in America with others.
likwidnyte13: exactly
Kathryn Parmar: so why bother?
likwidnyte13: but he was working towards what we have today and what we'll have tomorrow
Kathryn Parmar: what is that?
likwidnyte13: the hope that things will change
likwidnyte13: I love America
likwidnyte13: I don't love everything about it
likwidnyte13: but I wouldn't totally leave America all together
likwidnyte13: they wouldn't know
likwidnyte13: I have something I want you to think about real quick
likwidnyte13: there's only 78% of the nation who supports interracial couples. Think of where that statistic has come from, say, 50 years ago. Now, think about if you came up against a member of the nation who doesn't agree with it. Do you try to make them see the love you share with Karan, make them see that there isn't any reason for them to see you two as an interracial couple? Do you just give up, and is that giving up on your acceptance as a married couple in the eyes of yourselves and others? And lastly, do those people who don't agree with your lifestyle make you feel like you deserve less, make you feel like you're any different from anyone else, make you feel like you should leave your home in search for greener pastures?
likwidnyte13: And then think of what it'd be like if you weren't allowed to marry him.
Kathryn Parmar: I have an answer for you but it won't be fair to you because in my entire relationship with him, it's more acceptible than it used to be and I don't know what that would have been like....
Kathryn Parmar: But...
likwidnyte13: Your father didn't agree with it at first, but how have you changed his opinon?
Kathryn Parmar: We run across people every now and then who you can tell they are wondering what I'm doing with him. In France, on the train, I know they thought he kidnapped me.
Kathryn Parmar: (really)
Kathryn Parmar: anyway....
Kathryn Parmar: It sounds easy....but we ignore them and live our life.....probably much like you do.
Kathryn Parmar: Now...
Kathryn Parmar: if we werent' allowed to be married becuase of interracial....
Kathryn Parmar: then
Kathryn Parmar: I'd be upset and I'd probably just live with him forever....
Kathryn Parmar: however
Kathryn Parmar: I understand the unique problems you are up against probably more than you think I do.
Kathryn Parmar: so don't think that I'm insensitive
likwidnyte13: no, I'm not thinking that
likwidnyte13: however, you say you just ""live with it"" but in the case of grandpa, you gave him the only option of acceptance, and took nothing less....so you haven't just lived with it
likwidnyte13: as far as homosexuals, all *we* can do is try to change the opinon of one person at a time
likwidnyte13: the same thing you have done
likwidnyte13: the same thing black people have done over the years
likwidnyte13: my *homosexual forefathers* have made this place it is today, just as your *interracial couple forepeople* have made this place what it is today

"event","So, today I was thinking, at work, believe it or not.

Okay, yeah, that's not my only point. See, it was rainy/snowy today all day long. Makes it sorta depressing, but really, just one of those days that you wanna curl up in a blanket and watch dvds all day instead of go outside. Then I got to thinking that sometimes it may feel to Michael and/or I that we've started to become too comfortable in our relationship. Then, for the rest of the day, I had this growing excitement to spend time with him and just to see him and it made me realize that even if sometimes it feels too comfortable, there are still more of those times where it's the most exciting thing in the world to me just to go home and know he's going to be there.

Okay, done with that, just wanted to write the mushy stuff. The strange thing is, though, is the last time I ever wrote such mushy stuff it was about Michael E back in the way back days and it was 99.9% lies. It feels good to be able to say things like that honestly.

So, Michael and I went to see Connie & Carla tonight. It's definately a MUST SEE. Don't wait. You need to see it! It's such a well written comedy."

"event","There's a poll on idolonfox.com as to who you'll miss most. As of last night it had garnered 11.6million votes. 74% voted JPL.

Okay, I think that everyone who likes and votes for John Stevens are closet fans. Media all day long has been BLASTING John Stevens. It's a humungus bandwagon. Now, perhaps this means that John will get next to no votes whatsoever next week and get voted off...which I feel will be his backlash...or there's some sort of strange thing going on. It doesn't seem like a single person I know, or people they know vote for John Stevens. I don't even know friends of friends uncles or aunts nextdoor neighbors who vote for him.

Yet somehow he's still there."

I miss me some Jennifer all ready!

Isn't it great that all three judges all but outrightly said that there is absolutely no reason that John Stevens should still be around?

They seemed to all freak out which caused them to go on about the fact that it's a talent show, not a popularity show...but whoever thinks it's a popularity show and therefore votes for John Stevens must suck major ass. Yes, I'm talking to you. You suck major ass. I'll kick it too. (but not really, I'm too passive-aggressive to get into a fight)

I'm glad Randy said what he said though, referring to the fact that they need to be proud of who wins, and basically saying that they won't be proud of John Stevens.

Funny that, no?"

So, what did I do, given my hate for frat boys?

Since ""dougie"" shared a folder, I happend to place about 100 MB of gay porn on his computer.

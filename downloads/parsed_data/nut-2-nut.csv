"event","well i am back home from america!
after havin three whole weeks livin with both my parents and my nan and grandad. but i must say it was a brilliant three weeks i got to spend swimin with sharks and wondering around disney land and feedin the dolphins, BUT the best part was seeing My cousons from New Zealand i was so happy to have them to talk to during those three weeks it was a dream come true!
then on FRIDAY the 13TH OF AUGUST when we ment to leave to go home we were told that all flights were to be delaid because a huricain in the name of CHARLEY was going to hit florida at 8:30 and was told to seek shelter as soon as possable. so we went back to our villa locked the doors and borded up the windows, it was sooo scarey!
then the warnings started......on the tv at first telling us how many hours we have left and to put all matresses against the windows. they were saying this was the worst hurricaine the had seen in so many years!
then they said it wasnt only a hurricaine it ws  a tornado as well.
when it came i was shittin myself i tell you that! the whole villa was shaking the lights were flikering and the tv had lost signal and was making this wierd beeping sound.
i saw advertisement boards flighing cars lifted of the ground and this tornado was the biggest thing i had ever seen!
after the storm was over we were told to pick up our suit cases and was told we flighing home! i was so happy, we had had a brilliand holiday but enough was enough!
but because of the hurricaine and the tornado there wasnt any surplies on the plane which means that for eight hours on the plane all i got to eat was a piece of cheese and crakers and one small can of coke!
yup i was defentally hungary when i got off the plane!
and that was my three week holiday put short.
i am sorry it took me so long i forgot my password!"

"event","My faith in Wolverhampton is ever dying. Last night I went to the Planet to see Eden Maine. 17 people turned up to see this amazing band. 

I love it how everyone that normally goes to the Planet on emo/hardcore night stands around looking down on everyone and being all elitist and shit, but when it comes to seeing a proper hardcore band play live and the club they frequent so much, they couldn't care less. 

I don't dress emo or scene or whatever it is but I'm pretty sure I know more about it than every one of those tight jeaned, alexisonfire tshirted dickheads. Oh the irony.

Burn in hell elitist Planet assholes, you missed the best night at the Planet ever."

"event","Man, I just remembered this and want to put it in livejournal so I can remember it forever.

Friday night Moe, Jamie, Chris and I were driving to the cinema at 11:45 at night to go and see Ong-Bak (which, by the way, is the best film ever) and we were listening to district fm. So I decided to text in a message and lo and behold, the read it out on air!!! here is what it said

""Maximum boost to the Hotblack Ninja Squad, cruising the mean streets of Chapel Ash""

AS IF THE HOTBLACK WAS MENTIONED ON AIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It gave us so much joke.

Hotblack are coming, watch out you bastards"

"event","Wow... so much has happened to me since the last time I wrote on here.

- I have become a ninja.
- I've been to Norwich and had one of the most amazing times of my life.
- I've spent an amazing Easter with the best friends I could ever ask for.
- I actually leave the house at night now to venture into Wolverhampton city centre.

But

- I no longer play in any kind of musical ensemble.
- And I no longer have Kathryn...

However

- There is this absolutely beautiful girl I think I have started to fall for...
- I don't think I stand much of a chance though.

Here's hoping..."

"event","Tonight I went swimming at Esporta with my dearest Kathryn and her family. I was allowed in as a guest. I am not very good at swimming but Kathryn is teaching me how to do the breaststroke so soon I will be the king of the pool. We are going to go every thursday as part of our 'do more things together' initiative. It was good, but I think Kathryn thought I hated it. I was just scared and she would not let me do it in my own time, damn woman has no patience! I'm not employing her at my school. 

Valentines day was nice, we went to see Oceans 12 which was pretty good, then we came back to mine and exchanged gifts. We agreed we wouldn't spend much on each other seeing as we spent loads birthday and christmas. I kept to my end of the deal but she spent loads and I felt really bad! I suppose I did cook dinner and pay for the cinema, but still... and then we just spent the rest of the night at mine, it was nice ^_^

Nothing much else to report, work at 11 in the morning, I guess I should be in bed

"event","I think they are going to throw me out the band. I never go to practice and I refuse to do the tour. Can't blame them really. But still, they don't look at things realistically. We are barely established round here, let alone Kent and Bradford and whatever other crazy places they have booked. Nobody is going to give a shit round there. Waste of time. I figure because they all think that only about 20 bands exist in the world, they think they have chance of making it. Alas, hundreds of thousands of bands dream of making it big and about 2 only ever do, but they never listen to me. I don't condem what they are doing, and I wish them all the best and hope they do make it big, but I can't see it happening and even if it did, it's not what I want in life. I want to be a teacher. What I do hate is being made to feel guilty and pressured into doing it and nagged all the time. Anyway...

Everything else is ok. Work is good, even if they do only pay me minimum wage, it's still fun and I am learning new things everyday. I should still get a pay rise tho. I do too much fucking work for that place and nobody ever says thank you (apart from Emma and Paddy). School is good also. I am applying for a full time (paid!!) classroom assistant job in the summer to cover maternity leave. It will be helping children to whom English is a second language. I hope I get it.

Today was pancake day. I had 6 in total! 2 at work, 2 at home and then 2 at Kathryns. I invented my own types too

i - caramalised apples and honey
ii - strawberrys and maple syrup

BUM TING YO.

I'm going to bed now to watch the Village. Those monster things give me the creeps."

"event","I have returned to ye olde live journal, or as i now call it ol' delete-o. this is because i posted this totally amazing comic on here that took me 400 hours to build or whatever and then it went missing. the only solution i can come up with is that the king and owner of livejournal (captain diary) saw it and took it down, because if anyone else saw it, they would totally explode because it revealed forces and powers so deadly that the world is just not ready for such information.

today i kinda just did nothing til half 5. oh i tidied my room, but thats whack. i then went to work, there was no one in to eat tho..in the end we did about 8 walk-ins and decided to call it a night as the GP was already at a loss. alas, i was locked out, as i didnt have a key so i treked to my nans and waited for my parents to get back from whereever they were. kathryn had a go at me for this, when will women learn that men cannot read minds/see into the future. im getting quite fed up of her losing it all the time for no reason lately to be honest.

my new years resolution was to join the gym. i still havnt done it, but i will, i swear down. im going to go with jem and andy and paddy and emma from work, pump some iron baby. on the other hand, i have been eating healthier and more regular so soon i wont be fat anymore, i hope.

finally, i got an unconditional offer from kent to study classics and philosophy. i am happy, yet also sad. it is too far away :("

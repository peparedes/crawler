She finished her 10th year of dance in spite of the fractured vertebrae.&nbsp; She finished top of her class and managed to secure several scholarships for college.&nbsp; She has made new friends and even smiles more.&nbsp; <br /><br />This summer the kids and youth group started a mission team.&nbsp; They have been working very hard to help the elderly and disabled in our church community.&nbsp; They are an amazing group of kids who have not shied away from the challenge.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, this past month or so we have been deep in planning for the next <a href=""http://www.4dayjesus.com"">4 Day Jesus</a><br />This is a youth revival type experience but it is WAY better than any regular church revival you can imagine.&nbsp; The bands are so amazing!&nbsp; The speakers have been so life-impacting over the years that we are starting to gather a crowd of adults as well.&nbsp; It is so much fun.&nbsp; <br /><br />Last, I am now learning to quilt...because I didn't have enough to do already!&nbsp; I was sitting there thinking of something to get Ashleigh for her graduation present and thought about a quilt for her dorm.&nbsp; (She is always freezing!)&nbsp; I realized it is too late to do that for her so I decided to make Mikayla one now.&nbsp; YAY ME for not procrastinating!&nbsp; Below is one of the squares.&nbsp; I must say it is sufficient for a first time quilter.&nbsp; :p<br /> <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/belliebutton510/pic/00003tkd/""><img width=""320"" height=""240"" border=""0"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/belliebutton510/pic/00003tkd/s320x240"" /></a><br /><br />So...what have you all been up to?&nbsp; What new things are exciting in your lives?&nbsp; I would go back and read through the past 6 months but I still have children to raise.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; <br /><a onclick=""javascript:toggleMedia('http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a130/holliercs/03102008019.jpg', 'holliercsth_03102008019.jpg')""><u> </u><br /></a>"

"event","My baby is sick.  He's got the croupy cough, the ear pulling, and feverishness.  His tiny nose has flowed mightier than the grand Niagra Falls this weekend.  However, he is such a character and insists on making us laugh.  Imagine his little cheeks bright red with fever (102 degrees) and him dancing around to the Wiggles (our newest and best friends!).

<lj-cut text=""Read More"">For those not in the know, my kids will be homeschooled next year.  Peyton had his bout with the bully resulting in his 3 day, in school suspension...for defending himself yet never throwing a punch.  Coincidentally, <i>Judging Amy</i> today deals with zero tolerance policies and how they have the potential to teach kids that authority cannot be trusted to do the right thing.  Try explaining to a kid who loves life more than candy why he has been suspended for not backing down when challenged.  It's not so easy to do.  I would like to point out again his lack of punch throwing or physical involvement in the incident.  Matter of fact, his pink slip stated ""Involved in an altercation but did not fight back.""  

Mikayla's grades and lack of direction and guidance are grating on my nerves.  Her constant worry about her appearance, she's only in 3rd grade, and the head hanging low watching the confidence ooze out of her body is too much.  While I understand the importance of socialising for these children, I have to go further and state that life isn't like school.  Once a child's heart is wounded, that's it.  The healing process can take a lifetime.  It is going to take more than I can imagine to get her focused on what is important, rebuild that confidence, and get her set in the right direction to succeed.

For those worrying about my children's social development, they will be able to participate in clubs, sports, and attend classes several times per week with other homeschooled children.  After MUCH research, we've discovered the kids can have as normal a school experience as possible, without the crap of public schooling tossed in.  Not to mention, until they build a respectable private school closer to us, this is our only other option.

We've begun our next and final phase of construction on the house.  We're adding approximately 400 square feet of living space on to the back of the house for a livingroom.  
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/belliebutton510/pic/00002wz3/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/belliebutton510/pic/00002wz3/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>
I have new furniture to go in that livingroom!  We're also putting up walls inside the house to create seperate rooms whereas before it was one big room containing the kitchen, dining, and livingroom/office.  I will have a kitchen and breakfast area, complete with a ""nook.""  <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/belliebutton510/pic/000011ds/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/belliebutton510/pic/000011ds/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>
We will have a formal dining room, and an office.  Truth be told, we'll have a his and her's office.  <lj user=""jilu"">, where my desk is now will be Chad's drum room.  His old drum room will be remodeled to be my new office.  

The entire house, when we finish, will be sheetrock.  GOOD BYE FOREVER YOU FOUL PANELING!!!  The floors will be REAL floors!  No more industrial, Wal-Mart tiles throughout the house!!  Chad said If I'm really abundantly sweet I may get a new bedding set out of this deal.  WOOHOO!

Now hiring painters, sheetrock hangers, and flooring installers.  Payment will be rendered in the form of good ol' Southern soul food, iced tea, and pots of coffee as far as the eye can see.

Just think, YOU could be a part of building my dream home.  ;)</lj-cut>"

"event","Life is so funny sometimes.  When you least expect it, something pops back into your life after so long, you'd forgotten it ever existed.  Sometimes, that thing has so many other things associated with it you get a retro overload.  Then there are times that overload gets so big, you act on it and go looking for an item to bring into your life that will help you keep that thing present forever.

<lj-cut text =""Read More"">Yesterday, Jonathan and I were dancing around to a Wiggles.  I had to go into the kitchen for something.  While I was in there, I hear this song start that I haven't heard since forever.  I was swiftly transported from my kitchen to my grandparent's basement in Pennsylvania.  I can see me, my cousin, brother, and usually Aunt Sue sitting there singing the music scrolling over the bar on the player piano.  I can still see the red boxes stacked next to the piano.  Rows and rows of them!  They had everything from the Andrews Sisters belting out their <i>Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy</i> to <i>Glow Worm</i> to the very one that picked my memory...<i>Music Box Dancer</i>.  

So many summer days sitting down there playing pool, air hockey, and singing away fill my memories.  The amount of Scrabble and Rummy and Checkers games played has to be in the millions.  Grandpa always had a can of almonds sitting on the stand next to his recliner.  That jar was always empty when we left their home.  

Grandma sent me a package about 8 years ago.  She used one of her hand towels from the master bathroom as a cushion for the packing.  When I opened that box, I could smell the detergent and Grandpa's aftershave.  I put that towel in a baggie to keep the smell.  It was comforting and familiar.  

When I visit now, the must and dust and the occasional hint of some incense Grandpa lit long before linger in the drafty, damp basement.  The books are stacked on the shelves, begging to tell their story once again.  The pool table and cue rack are long gone.  Where the air hockey game once stood now stands tables filled with books and momentos my Grandpa has collected.  Sadly, the piano is gone as well.  It was sold, along with the music rolls, many years ago...before Chad was in my life.

This is the magnificent thing about memories.  Even when the basement stands empty, it is still filled and bursting with life in my mind and in my heart.  It's not just the things either.  The people are there too.  My Grandma can go down those steps in my memories, without fear of falling.  She can sit at that piano and play a song so lovely and sweet.  She still sings the words to teach them to me.  She still has the energy and strength to push the pedals so we can sing along with the player.  Aunt Sue and Aunt Nan are still standing behind my dad singing beautifully as we all join in after a big dinner.

In my memory, I still can't get all of the words to <i>Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy</i> to come out of my mouth when they should.  However, I can sing <i>I Feel Pretty</i> in a manner nearly worthy of Broadway.  I can still see my one armed Grandpa teaching me to play pool and successfully whooping me good in a game of air hockey.  My brother and I are still caught in a game of Checkers and my cousin Lori still beats me in a game of Scrabble.

Now I just need a player piano.  Anyone have about $10k to spare? </lj-cut>"

"event","I have sat here and thought about each and every one of the things you said to me today.  I have gone over in my brain how many times we have bitten our tongues to keep from dishonoring you, as you liked to throw in my face today.  I have gone further back from the most recent things you brought up and thought about the whole 13 + years Chad and I have been together.  I think I have an answer to your accusations of our lack of concern for you two.

<lj-cut text=""Read More"">First of all, I think back to the times you told me about the activities your family went through when Ron and Chad were kids.  I think about the number of times I heard about 1. Drinking/partying, 2. LSU games for you two while the boys were at home with a sitter, and 3. The amount of time you all spent at the ballparks because Mr. Harvey played for Ti-Gator.

Everyone of your activities when the boys were young were for the two of you...not your kids.  That is one area we are different.  Everything Chad and I do is for our children.  The little time we do get outside of busy church and work schedules is set aside for the children.  We rarely even date one another because ALL that we do is with and for the kids.  You get upset that we don't drop our plans to visit you because you don't have and never had our mindset where the kids are concerned.

Next, we choose to not go to your house because you have dogs that run the house down.  The last time we were there, Jonathan's socks were yellowish brown and soaking wet from stepping in dog urine.  You can blame a lack of hygiene for our not visiting your home.  However, we have made it abundantly clear that our door is ALWAYS open to visitors, especially loved ones.

About the hugging and going overboard with greetings...if you haven't figured it out after this amount of time, no matter what words I use, you won't get it.  I am not a hugging, touchy feely, kind of person.  I never have been. I reserve my hugs for special occasions and the like...when they mean the most.  However, because you accuse me of being cold, I go out of my way to hug you when I see you because it is what you like.  So, that being said, I will no longer do what pleases you because my attempts at it are belittled and ridiculed.  My desires to please you quite apparently do not please you so I will, from here on out, quit trying.

You accused us of not caring enough and not realizing enough of the tragedy you went through with cancer.  To that I respond with ""It was your own fault.""  Each time we tried to spend time with you, you gave us stories about germs, booster shots, etc that would exclude our children from visiting with you all.  Thus, we stayed away.
In fact, I did more than stay away.  I contacted oncology specialists and doctors who assured me the threat of infection was a lot smaller than you made it out to be.  You could have held your grandson more had you tried. Oh and here's the thing, all those worries about germs and infections were nothing more than an excuse for you.
How do I know?  Because you obviously had no trouble visiting a casino...where germs abound.  Matter of fact, you missed your granddaughter's Christmas musical because instead, you went to a casino.

I asked you about going to a luncheon with the church because they thought enough of you to not only pray for you but they also send you a monthly newsletter, inviting you to join them.  You give me excuses about your knees and how bad they are and how you can't stand or walk very far.  Oh but this weekend you could go to a Mardi Gras party and live it up?  

We've made attempt after attempt to be a part of your lives.  When we moved back from Idaho, we tried to come around and visit EVERY weekend.  We were quickly told that while we were gone, you two went on with your lives and now had other things to do.  We were told we couldn't expect you to sit around and wait on us...you had a life now.  Again, we backed off.  You shot yourself in the foot with this one and you still blame us.  

You continually claim I don't visit with you when you are over.  You say I'm cold or indifferent to your presence.  Again, my efforts to please you go unnoticed.  I won't greet you anymore.  I won't sit and show you the colors we picked for the house ever again.  I won't chit chat about my day or about the kids and their lives ever again.  I am tired of you claiming a lie about me.  You accused me of it once and I refused to let it be true.  I took every effort to not be what you accused me of and still I can't please you.  I'm tired of trying.

We didn't sound concerned enough for your plight with chemo and didn't call enough.  You made it abundantly clear that 1. the kids couldn't be around you, and 2. Your sister was there to do it all.  I backed off.  I have 3 children.  One of 
those 3 is a toddler.  He goes where I go.  If he can't go, then neither can I.  Therefore, I wasn't going to your house to help out because he and his germs couldn't be around you.  Next, we tried several times to be a part and help you 
during this time.  Each time we were met with ""Oh, but Janice is here.  She can do it for us.  Don't worry about it.""  From now on, when you want concern and sympathy, call Janice.  I'm tired of trying.  

You said we don't understand what all you went through, the pain, the disorientation, the numbness.  You ACCUSE us of indifference and say we just go along as if you're perfectly fine.  We have asked you how you were.  You told us you
were fine.  Other than a bit of shakiness and numbess in your feet, we thought you were great because YOU TOLD US YOU WERE.  How convenient it is for you to withhold information from us then toss it back at us as an arrow to pierce and hurt.  I'm tired of trying.

We rush to the hospital when you call to tell us something is wrong with Mr. Harvey.  We go so your son can be a source of comfort for you both.  We go because it is our duty, as children, to be there.  Each time we were called, we've been there when it was physically possible.  This time, however, your sister attacks me for not coming around more and being a part of your life.  YOUR SISTER!!  I can only guess what you've accused us of.  Did you bother telling her about the times we did try?  Did you bother telling her about your ""we have a life now"" comments?  I cook dinners at your request and offer to do more if you'd just tell me what you needed.  How big of you to forget to tell her this and instead make us out to be the villains.  I'm tired of trying.

We repeatedly invite you over for visits and such and you continually have either something better to do or you're too tired and sick to join us.  However, when the opportunity arises to go to the Final Four, you're all over it, germs and illness be damned.  I'm beginning to see a pattern to your illness here.  Anything from disorientation to wobbly knees pops up when it's something you don't want to do.  Fine...I'm tired of trying.

Quit calling my house and accusing me of everything under the sun when you haven't taken the time, in 13 + years, to get to know me.  Stop calling my husband at work to ""tattle"" on me or to fuss at him.  He works too darned hard in a dangerous environment for you to continue calling him and upsetting him.  Stop calling him when I'm not here or when  he's at work to avoid talking to me then blaming me for not being friendlier with you.

Your son wanted to stay with you in the hospital and you pushed him away.
Your son wanted to spend time with you on the weekends and you pushed him away.
Your son wanted to involve you in our lives and you pushed him away.

You don't get to come at us now and cry and moan over how we aren't around.  You can't whine about my children not knowing you when you refused to be a part.  You can't use your husband as an excuse to not see us when you have a phone, at the very least, to call and ask to see us.  

You put your ""life"" ahead of us and we backed off to grant your wish.  If you're lonesome now, that's something you have to deal with.

I love you very much.  My husband loves you very much.  My children all love you very much.  But we will not allow you to use us and be a part of our family when it suits you.  You're either in or out.  I'm tired of trying.</lj-cut>"

It can spiral out of control. 
It can take the very ability to breath right out of you.
It can make you feel as if an elephant is sitting on your chest.
It can take away all hope.

And that change didn't even happen to me...directly.

Geramy Glen Watts, age 29, passed away  at 7:40am December 6th at his home.  He leaves behind a wife of 9 years, Jamie, a son, Gerad (10), and two daughters, Kara (18 months) and Callie (3 years).

An aneurysm took the life of this young man.  His wife, Chad's cousin, found him.  His son watched as the paramedics tried relentlessly and without success to revive him.  His daughters will never know him.  His wife, a widow before she is 30.  

Gerad won't go home.  He refuses to even entertain the thought because he knows the couch is there...the one his daddy died on.  Jamie's brothers ripped the carpet out of the living room yesterday because all the cleaning in the world couldn't erase the spots of blood she still sees.  The new couch will be in soon.  The hardwood floors are being installed this week.

This was, by far, the hardest, saddest, funeral I have ever been to.  Being close to the family doesn't help at all.  Trying desperately to NOT let the ""what if's"" creep in has become a daily battle.  I want so badly to help her right now but I can't even figure out a way to address the Christmas card without breaking down.

My kids went with us to the funeral.  Peyton won't talk about it at all.  He wouldn't even acknowledge where we were.  He played with the flowers that fell from the arrangements instead.  Mikayla is cautious with her hugs and acted out in class this week.

Don't wait to make things right.  Don't assume they know how you feel.  Take every opportunity to cherish."

"event","So I have this gray hair thing going on.

I have <b><i><u>ALOT</u></i></b> of this gray hair thing going on.  So much so that I underlined, bolded and italicized the word ""alot.""  Because it is so abundant I thought I would go have highlights put in to cover up the gray a bit more.  It worked fantastically!!  The only downside was the extreme brittle feeling of my hair.  I hardly use gel on it much less something as harsh as bleach/peroxide/ammonia stuff.

So anyway...it was looking good until the roots started growing out again.  I could not go through with processing my hair again only to make it drier than it already was.  Then my mom calls me one day with a verse from Proverbs that struck a chord in me! Proverbs 16:31 says ""Gray hair is a crown of splendor; it is attained by a righteous life.""   Cool right??

Nope.

I tried.  I really did.  But the roots growing out thing was looking horrid.  I had to do something.  Then I remember color rinses and temporary colorants that wash out in 20 or so washes!! 

YAY ME!!

I get this pretty little medium brownish auburn thing.  There was much rejoicing for I was smarter than the gray and still too young to look at it with joy in my heart.  Ok I dont really mind the gray.  It was that root thing again!  

So I color my hair with the Natural Instincts #22 Cinnaberry Medium Auburn Brown.  The box color was soooooo nice and not flashy but sweet!  But is that what I got??

NO!!

I now have atop my noggin this really wicked ruby red mixed with brown thing going on.  I feel like a chocolate covered cherry!!

I dared to rebel against the gray roots and I must say, I like it.  ;)"

What is better still is when you <i>know</i> it to be true.  Not just a realisation but I mean really knowing it...deep down knowy knowing all there is to know about the matter.

We hear we're not meant for this world.  We were created for bigger and better things...namely a relationship with God, our creator.  We are told this isn't our home and that we're simply passing through into eternity.  

While those thoughts are nice, we're unable to fully comprehend what it really means to be at a stopping point on the way to Heaven.  We can't fathom the depth of what Heaven actually is because we're immersed in the only world we see.

When your heart aches because of the pain people experience, whether it is of their own making or not, and you long for perfection, that's when you realise there is something better and eternal.  This is the point when those heartaches can be defined as homesickness."

"event","<A HREF=""http://belliebutton510.livejournal.com/7023.html"">Here I was...still fat a year ago tonight.</A>

I was still awake and way too anxious for anything even remotely close to sleep.  There was a child inside of me that I had yet to meet.  A child who, over the past year, has reminded me of what innocense is and allowed me to feel what it is like to be up for 3 days and still be able to smile.

I held him close and watched him sleep tonight.  I remember the very first time I laid eyes on him.  I remember seeing the faces of his brother and sister and their extreme look of awe as they met their little brother for the first time.  His daddy was completely smitten with him from the word go as he was with the older kids.  

I think back on this year and I can't get my fingers around the notion that I am raising children.  

They are my life.  Every morning I wake is for them.  Every worry and smile I go through has them as the foundation of emotion.  When I am not with them, I feel like I can't be who I really am because they help define me.  

Children are an amazing gift God granted us with.  I can't even begin to describe to you the abundance of emotions we go through as parents.  There are those moments when you feel like you can't breathe because you are too happy or too sad or even too mad.  There are the quiet moments when you look at them and wonder what tomorrow holds.  Sometimes you realize they will one day think you're an idiot and hate everything that involves mom and dad and it breaks your heart to know there is nothing you can do to stop it.  What breaks your heart even more is knowing someone will someday break your child's heart.  The only thing worse is when you, the parent, break their heart.

So, on with the show...

Happy First Birthday Jonathan Brody.  You were, from the moment we knew you existed, loved more than you could ever imagine.  I pray you continue to grow healthy and happy.  I pray your daddy and I will be all you need us to be.  I pray you never ever doubt how much we love you."

clean and as I type this Jonathan is ""helping"" me by pu.10shing .on the number pad and ""holding"" the mouse.

Let's see how this goes.

Peyton finds out today if he made the volleyball team.o  I have confidence in him.

Do you know how hard it is to type with a 112 month old plying gra6bbyt with the puter????

Work is still going fine.  I still like the mad cash each week...0.996
It's nice to know I'm now contributing in more ways than just a clean home and food on the table.  I know I do more than that and I oversimplified my job but hey.  You get the picture.

The boy has given up on the computer now.  His toy drum and Baby Einstein have stolen him away.

Chad has tremendous stress at work.  I know he can do the job and his boss knows it.  He, on the other hand...you know what?  He knows he can too.  He's just overwhelmed with pesky co-workers who whine all of the time about their crappy lives that THEY created yet want someone else to pity them for and fix for them.

Have I mentioned how much I can't stand to be around people who make it all about them?  I mean sure...you have a problem, you fuss about it to clear the mind and then solve it.  You don't get to run amok and tell anyone with ears about your issues in hopes to build up that pity party only to sit around and let the problem fester and ooze like a boil on your butt.

I've been told I'm very intolerant.  Oh well...moving on.

I have this deep, and I do mean like soul seeking kinda deep, desire to become more of an encourager.  That said, I will now reply to someone's issues with ""Ah shut it and do something about it!  I'll help!!"" instead of the typical ""Ugh...would you SHUT UP!?!""  

I'm not really that rude to a person but I do think it from time to time.  I do like solving problems.  I hate solving the same ones over and over.  One day I will go back and finish that degree.  I'll be the next Dr. Phil..Dr Phyllis!

I've also been told I have the gift of...let's use the word exhortation.  It sounds less snippy.  So I see this exhorting and encouraging working well together.  :D  

Ohhh he needs a sippy of milk and a cuddle from me!  Naptime is it?  The eyes they are getting heavy.  I want to nibble his curls."

With all this Charles Roberts shooting up the Amish people business in the news lately I have a question.

As I recall, the Amish do not want their picture taken and such.  Are their rights being violated with the media surrounding their world right now?  Do the media have the right to video them or have they gained permission to do so?

I really hope their beliefs, no matter what I may think of them, are being considered especially in the middle of this tragedy."

My day off and I was productive!  I Got the house all cleaned and ready for me to cook dinner as soon as we walked in the door from picking Peyton up from tryouts.  It was all set!

Chad shows up to the tryouts on his way home from work and as we're standing around waiting for Peyton he says, ""Let's just pick something up for dinner tonight.  I know you have a dinner planned but let's just take it easy tonight.""  I was all for it considering I usually have dinner finished by 5:30-6:00.

So we get our son and head off to Taco Bell.  What a loverly little family outing...me, the kids, Chad...driving down the road laughing and loving...being all cute and stuff.  

So we get our food and get home.  We're sitting at the table eating and in walk my parents.

Jonathan has developed this incredible little personality in the past week or so.  I can't stop giggling at this little clown!  He likes to wrinkle up his nose and snort at you then toss his head back and laugh.  His newest toy is an empty box that he stands on and ""dances.""  He looks like he's stomping ants when he dances.  I can't believe the end of this very precious first year is just days away.

I hope and pray my little girl knows how much we cherish her.  Just watching her smile and laugh...to see write her stories and illustrate them...she is my little princess...my Angel Bunny.  I pray we are the parents God needs us to be for her.  I pray she is strong and diligent in her faith and in who she is in Christ.  

When it comes to Peyton, I get scared.  I have a fear in me that I know I have to let go of.  I know my oldest has placed himself firmly in the loving hands of our Savior.  I see God taking him to the ends of the earth.  Look out world!!  He will be your next Steve Irwin.  I can see him converting every manner of beast all over God's creation. XD

Then...

I go to bed and have the absolutely strangest dream!!  I'm out delivering pizza when this storm suddenly blows in.  I'm in the neighborhood, looking for the house and watching the water rise.  So I then notice the highest house on the block belongs to a fellow Dominos employee.  Never did figure out who this mystery person is but he was kind enough to let US ALL, that's right, all of the employees, come into his house to weather the storm.

So we're all hanging out in this college style bachelor pad watching the wind and rain around us, never losing electricity and playing games, watching tv and such.  Then people start milling about outside.  So I yell out the window, ""HEY!  If any of you find my car there's a free pizza in the back for you!""

Strange, I know.  But not as strange as the one I had last week.  That one is hilarious!!  Right before bed I watched part of ""Law and Order : CI"" followed by the episode of ""Will and Grace"" where Jack is stalking Kevin Bacon.  So then I dream...

I dream that Vincent D'Onofrio is stalking me.

On a much happier note, my baby started toddling around this week.  YAY!!  Jonathan is da man!!  Now if we could only get him potty trained.  Those 6am dirty diapers SUCK!  He also ""brushes"" his hair and does the ""WASSSSSSUP!"" with his tongue hanging out.  Cracks me up!!  He is such a little character."

Are my reasons to homeschool valid?  That's the next big question.  Am I doing it to attempt to shelter my kids from the abuse I took or am I wanting to do it purely to give them something the public schools can't offer academically?  I know I can't shelter them.  I know they will get picked on and such.  I know that good or bad the stuff I went through had a hand in who I've become so it can't be an all out failure.  

My intentions are pure.  However, are they what going to help or harm?

I added up my tips and mileage comp today.  I nearly fell over when I totalled it to see what I had earned since the 15th.  Dave Ramsey would be proud of the way we're using that extra money.  :p

I want to find a church that is totally dedicated to furthering God's kingdom.  I am sick of the naysayers and the rumor spreaders and the ""My money kept this church going!!""-ers and the ""OMG did you see WTF she was wearing!?!""-ites.  

I want to see it get back to what it is supposed to be.  No politics.  No bickering over what is and isn't popular, accepted, proper, etc.  

If God is moving you to do something...DO IT!  Quit sitting on your butt waiting for an invite or waiting for someone else to do it.  Get out there and get on fire for the Big Guy!!  Quit listening to the person who is in the way for no other reason than to discourage.  

Just makes me want to smack someone and remind them that Jesus hung out with the lowly, the destitute, the poor and afflicted.  That Cool Cat went out into the ditches and by ways and gave hope to those who were turned on and hopeless.  He didn't offer anything but pure love and forgiveness, grace and mercy.

Why have we lost that in the Church today?  Why do we get so holier than thou and forget those who are really hurting, including our own members?  How can we turn our noses up at someone who comes in ragged and down trodden?

People are stupid.  We're bigots and hypocrits and we forget where we came from.  We forget to care...to love...and forgive.  Nevermind encouraging and supporting!

I know my kids are with someone I trust COMPLETELY to take care of them.  Let's not forget how incredibly flexible they are with that there schedule thing!

I'm a working stiff again.  Earning the minimum wage.  My general manager is 10 years younger than me and calls me ""Ma'am"" and/or ""Mrs. Stacey.""  I can't help but giggle insanely at this.

On a final note...Crazy Woman was called out by an acquaintance of her's and has since deleted her Myspace, all of her ""baby"" pictures that she took from other people, and has taken the website offline.  Apparently contacting the Attorney General of Alabama will freak a person out enough to make them start deleting evidence.  It's kind of funny.  Not really but kind of."

"event","So crazy lady has done it again.

She's posting pictures of babies this time claiming them as her own.  Thing is, I have super sleuthing skills and found the website from which the babies came.  The owner was upset but knows he can do nothing to stop her because apparently its not against any kind of law to say someone else's child is your's in cyberspace.

Her babies can be found <a href=""http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i104/Zeek-Vannah/new/home.jpg"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.twinstuff.com/twinbabies18.html""> here.</a>  She has passed on all of the pics on that page as her's except the third one.  By the way, those babies are boys. 

Did I mention she has taken pictures with Ashton Drake dolls?  Twin dolls, no less.  <a href=""http://www.dollsbearsandgifts.com/catalog_ashton_drake/Sugar_spice.html"">Sugar and Spice</a>.  <a href=""http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i104/Zeek-Vannah/6%20days/DSCF0528.jpg"">Her with her ""son.""</a>

How about her taking money and gifts from people?  Oh and she came to LA to help with Katrina in a shelter.  Went home and post pictures of ""her"" trip.  Some of the pictures were taken from FoxNews.com. <a href=""http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a130/holliercs/Vick3.jpg"">Here</a> is one part of the post she made.  Notive the little boy with the bottle in his mouth?  Now go do a Google search for ""Joshwa Coyette.""  Oh and yes, that is her with her husband, who I think may be oblivious in some of this.  <a href=""http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a130/holliercs/Vick2.jpg"">Another</a> and <a href=""http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a130/holliercs/Vick5.jpg"">another</a> and <a href=""http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a130/holliercs/Vick7.jpg"">another</a> and <a href=""http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a130/holliercs/Vick8.jpg"">another</a>

If her game of conning people out of a few bits of cash and caring weren't affecting people I consider friend, I would enjoy this for the entertainment value.  Alas, I cannot.  Therefore, I post it so that you all can point and laugh and warn your children's children about caring too easily."

"event","summer is almost over for the kids.  They return to school on August 9.  The house isn't finished yet but it has managed to dominate the lives of 4 families for the better part of a year.  If it goes on any longer there will be bloodshed...or divorce.  We have had no vacation with the kids.  A day trip to the putt putt place was the extent of our fun.  ugh...

"event","I have a problem.  

I cannot seem to stomach injustice.  Now, I'm not talking about something on such a level as Michael Jackson getting away with molesting a child or a drug dealer getting away with peddling a poison that kills.  

No.

I'm talking about basic human common sense and decency.  Like teaching your child to respect authority.  Leading by example.  Following the rules.

A child not performing on the baseball field because the parents of that child doesn't like the pitcher or feels the coach isn't doing things according to how they would do it really gets on my nerves.  You want to do things a certain way?  Sign up to coach.  Don't teach your child to stand like a statue at home plate during a game because you feel someone else should be pitching.  It only hurts the team.  TEAM!!  No ""I"" in there is it?  

Guess what human beings!!  It's not about you.  It's not about being a complete and utter nuisance to humanity just because you don't like the rules of the game or the way someone performs.  Is it really such an issue that you have to take the fun out of it for <b>8 year olds</b> instead of being out there for the sheer enjoyment of watching your child have a good time?

GAAA!!!  I swear it brings a burning in the pit of my stomach that nothing is ever done to these parasites on the world.  It absolutely drives me insane that I, who try to enjoy this small part of life with my child, have to deal with someone like this.  HAVE to deal with this because there is no law against being an asshole.

What about those who feel it necessary to drive like this is the qualifyings for Nascar?!  Who put you in charge of threatening the safety of MY family?  

For crying out loud people, look around you.  Take notice of the things that are really important, like the fact that a mother just lost her child and the doctors didn't know what to do to fix him.  He was only 5 weeks old.  That mother buried her baby yesterday and only got to hold him 5 times over the course of those 5 weeks.  What about the wife who watched helplessly as her husband slipped quietly away as cancer ravaged his poor body?  Is who pitches a game really that important when you stop to consider how fragile life is?  Does it matter that you're 5 minutes late and have drive like you own the road when you consider this man's grandchildren will not know how magnificent he was?

I hate people.  You all suck when all you can do is focus on your piddly little issues that will not matter to you or anyone else in a month or so.  

Get the hell up and get over yourselves already.  Contrary to what the t-shirts and Oprahs of the world say, it's NOT about you.  There are billions of other people on this planet and like it or not we have to co-exist.  Why not make the best of it instead of seeing how many bruises you can leave on the fragile little lives of children."

Jonathan is scoping it all out and deciding which position he wants to play.  In the meantime he has all of the fans cooing and oohing over his cuteness, causing them to miss the game.  HAHA!

<lj user=""jilu""> and her siblings came and went.  There was much enjoyment in their visit.  I want her back!  She makes me laugh.  I'll even build her her own room!!!

Mikayla made it in to the gifted program for next fall.  YAY!!!!  Peyton has the entire summer to get used to the fact that he and his sister will be in the same class for 2 hours a day.  I giggled lots at the look on his face.

Nothing much is going on here.  Just trying to survive the heat (think Hades here) and not run the electricity bill up to the point we would have to sell off children to pay for it. ::gasp::

My best friend called yesterday.  She can't seem to have children of her own, preliminarily speaking.  Somethin' ain't right with her parts.  I've offered my uterus as a foster home to her embryo if need be.  She kind of chuckled and said, ""Awww!  You'd get fat again for me??""  To which I replied, ""Honey, I've had 3 children.  My body is never going to be like Cindy Crawford's.""  That and I really want to see how she would cope with a child in her OCD style home.  

All kidding aside, she will make a fantabulous mommy.  I want her to be a mommy in the worst way.  Our relationship has really gotten strained this last year with me having Jonathan and her having none...again.  I miss my friend and want her to know what it's like to hold her very own child.

Today is the last full day of school for my babies.  We have Honors programs as well as the final meeting with the school board to find out whether Mikayla will be accepted into the gifted program.  I'm just a tad bursting with pride right now.

Mikayla leaves for her trip to Disney tomorrow.  I'm not a happy person with this going on.

I can't sleep. HA!

We did pressies last night (Tuesday night) instead of tonight because of church activities.  We do not usually buy gifts for one another because of the sharing a birthday thing so close to Mother's day.  This year my Chad cheated on that rule and bought me gift(s) anyway.  Blasted men!  Can't trust them!

The kids bought me cute things for the kitchen.  I happen to love this kind of gift.  Peyton got me a mug rack to sit right next to the coffee pot.  Practical little bugger!!  Mikayla got me a napkin and salt and pepper shaker holder thing to sit on the breakfast bar.  Again with the practicality!  These items just happened to go with...

DUN DUN DUUUUN!!

My brand new set of dishes that match my kitchen! (Pssst...this was the Mom's Day pressie Chad couldn't wait to give me since it went with the other kitchen stuff.)

Oh and that wasn't all!  I feel like a queen, I tell ya! 

Chad, my darling knight in shining armor, knowing how much I hated my bottom of the line, free with the signing of a 2 year contract, DESPERATELY in <strike>need</strike> want of a camera phone cell phone got me a RAZR!  ""How much does he love and adore you,"" might you ask??  Enough to buy me the black one, not that froo froo pink one!

Oh yes, I shall get him back for the breaking of the birthday rules.  Father's Day will be his punishment!!  He <strike>will</strike> might get a new phone or better yet!!  A power tool!!  HA HA!!  I will win the war of the gift giving to end all gift giving.  I thought I had won it at Christmas when what to his wondering eyes should appear but a fantastic gas grill!!  How can I top that???

The kids and I got him a couple of pairs of shorts, a new shirt, and a picture of the youngins for to hang in his office.  He also got a bag of Hershey's Special Dark kisses and a box of York mints all to himself.  He doesn't even have to share if he doesn't want to!  How's that for last minute birthday shopping!?!

Ok it's nearly 2am and I'm rambling almost incoherently.

"event","So we get a call to go to the hospital last night.  Chad's dad was taken in, we're told, due to chest pains and what not.  His heart is the size of a football they tell us.  

We get there and he's in pain when he moves and complains of a dull ache when he's at rest.  He's been coughing a lot.  CT scan shows nothing is wrong and it must be muscular from the cough.  They suspect pleurisy but do not diagnose that.  I should have known it wasn't what she made it out to be.  This was not the first time she played the alarmist card with her son...my husband...in an attempt to gain sympathy/attention.

While Chad and his mom are in the back with the doctor, I sit in the waiting room with the aunt, his mom's sister.  She begins to berate me for not calling the mom in law enough.  I get an earful from this woman about how my MIL has been through hell the past 6-7 months with the chemo and cancer and how we need to be there more for her and take an active role in the lives of my in laws.  We need to go there and see them because they never leave the house other than for doctor's appointments.

I was dumbfounded.  I was pissed beyond words.  I suspected this was coming but I held hope that my MIL wouldn't be so underhanded and manipulative to do what she has done.

My in laws have been invited to our home on more occasions than I can count.  We have called them EVERY week to check on them and I have gone so far as to cook for them when she was recovering from her surgery.  When she has called me to discuss something I have sat and talked with her regardless of what I was doing, often to the point of being on the phone for hours.  

They have turned down our invitations to come visit because they're too tired or have something else to do or because she can't be around anyone because of the chemo.  However, they have gone to parties (missed Peyton's birthday) instead of coming to spend time with their grandchildren.  They have gone to the casino (missed Mikayla's Christmas musical and several weekends when I cooked and invited them over) instead of coming to our house.  They couldn't come to Mikayla's bday party because she was too tired yet came to Peyton's ball game AND made a trip to Slidell, an hour away, for one of the other grandkid's bday party.

She tells me how much she loves God and has her life to thank Him for yet sits and wallows in the cancer and the fact that if it returns she will die from it.  She tells me how she knows she shouldn't be going to the casinos but turns around and tells her sister that we don't go see her.  She calls Chad at work and picks fights with him about all of this and tells my husband that I'm mean to her, that I don't speak when they come to visit.  She tells him that it is my fault my baby doesn't know her because I don't bring him to visit her!  Oh I thank God my husband isn't as ignorant as she thinks he is.  I swear if she caused us trouble in our marriage I don't know what I'd say. 

She puts on one face for us and shows the rest of the family something completely different.  God only knows what all she has told the other's!!  That cold shoulder I got at the wedding shower wasn't just my imagination, as I found out last night.  

I am so angry right now I could just spit!  How can one woman be so stupid??  

UGH!!!!!!"

"event","I miss being innocent.  I miss thinking like a child and not understanding the impact of the world on my life.
<lj-cut>

When my grandfather had cancer and he was suffering I didn't understand the impact of the loss of his life.  That impact went far beyond me losing my grandfather.  Someone lost a father, a husband, a son.  I was only 15 when he passed.  Within a week the pain had eased tremendously.  The firsts after his death were hard but not overly tearful.

I think back now and can't understand what the rest of the family went through. My mom...to lose a dad.  My grandmother...to lose her husband.  My great-grandfather outlived yet another child.

Forward 17 years...

My cousin in law is dying of cancer.  He has esophogeal cancer that has spread and caused tumors in his brain and lymph nodes.  The family has been called in.  My mom left this morning to go be with my cousin (Brenda, his wife).  

I sat last night and said prayer after prayer for Brenda and her sons.  As I prayed, I looked over at my sleeping husband.  I cannot imagine losing him.  I cannot begin to understand the depth of her pain.  Their children are losing a father.  I won't imagine that.

My grandmother is hanging on.  She isn't bedridden or anything.  Her oxygen drops.  Her lungs fill with fluid.  The sack around her heart fills.  She goes to the hospital and it is all drained.  She returns home.  Rinse and repeat.

She taught me the importance of sitting down and writing a letter, not just making a phone call.  She taught me to make nut rolls and pickled beets and eggs.  She showed me the beauty in sitting and watching as the birds came to eat.  She unknowingly taught me to deal with life with integrity, strength and no whining. There is a job to do.  Get to it.  There is no time for weakness, sadness, selfishness when you have a family to take care of.  Lean on God no matter what.  Take time to laugh and be silly.  Love with all you are and forgive without ever remembering.  They're worth fighting for.

She has taught me so many things.  My grandfather did too.  Things I carry with me today.  I just hope I do right by them and teach my children the life lessons they taught me.  It's their legacy.  It is who they are and were.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj user=""jilu""> already got the earfull but I feel I must share with the rest of you...

First, it's making the news down here that the evacuees are unhappy because they will not get rent assistance.  Um...it's been 8 months since the storm.  The job market is BOOMING down here.  If you can't get a job to pay YOUR OWN WAY, even one waiting tables, then you have to be a vegetable sitting in your own stew.

Second, St. Bernard Parish was featured tonight on one of the national news shows. It was reported that the parish president, a great large man by the name of Junior, didn't wait for the government to come to their aid.  They went forward rebuilding their lives ON THEIR OWN!  Junior made arrangements with a private company to supply his residents with 6500 travel trailers.  The school board was told by FEMA they would have to wait until this March passed to get anything going for an operational school.  They banned together and opened a single campus for K-12 very shortly after the storms.  ON THEIR OWN!!!

Why can't New Orleans do this?  

Third, it rained about 1.5 inches this past week.  That's it.  For this area, that's not a whole lot.  So, it rains that much.  The pumps in New Orleans FAILED within 30 minutes of being turned on!!  5 of them caught fire shortly after being turned on. 

And we want to rebuild this crap????

Last, and I know this is old news, Nagin is in the run off for Mayor of New Orleans.  Let's remember his failing the residents of that modern day Atlantis by not providing drivers for the busses that were meant to get those ""I want a free ride!"" citizens out of Nawlins.  I suppose if they were promised the moon they will continue to elect a steaming pile of poo.

Louisiana had a very well kept secret in the idjits who lived down there.  Katrina blew our dirty little secret right out for all to see.  With each passing day I grow more and more annoyed with the state I have always loved.  I am literally embarrassed.

On an up note...

The husband was on the news tonight.  Hehehehe.  He volunteers with ""Rebuilding Together"" each year and they did a teensy spot.  This year they got a close up though.  It was cool.   

The teensy one doesn't have a cold or pink eye.  We are most tickled about this.  It seems the poor dear inherited my sinus allergies.  :(

Peyton got his braces off today.  His ""GLOW IN THE DARK! WOW!!!"" retainer will be in in 2 weeks.

Mikayla calls pickled beets and eggs ""purpled eggs and beets.""  I swear the cuteness was thick as molasses.

Peyton tells me on the way back to the hotel last week, ""Oh my goooowash, Mom!!""  I said, ""Goooowash, Peyton??""  He says, ""Yep.  That's Yankee for 'gosh.'""

Maybe you have to hear him say it for it to be funny.  I couldn't stop laughing."

Tetherball Traits and Tendencies  Tetherball is the pose of perfect compromise, the oasis of a full-contact sleeper coupled with a solitary sleeper. The pose allows the Pole (the solitary one) a free range of movement, while the tight self-embrace of the Ball (the full-contact one) supplies the necessary crowded closeness. Both sides win!  
Comfort Zone  The Tetherball is part of the Wood sleepers family. Other Wood poses you might try include Pillow Talk, Pillow Listen and Stairway.  
Note  A series of small hip pats (called ""bubbles"") from the Pole infuses the Ball with reassuring feelings of closeness without triggering the Pole's delicate sense of claustrophobia."

"event","Back from a trip to Pennsylvania to say goodbye to my 91 year old grandmother.  

She hasn't passed yet but it is literally a matter of time...as it was a few months ago and a few months before that.  

Last weekend she was hospitalized with congestive heart failure and an inability to breathe.  Her heart is too weak to pump and the congestion in her lungs and around her heart are making it too hard for her to take a breath.  How incredibly hard it was to watch her work for each breath through blue lips as she smiled at her great-grandchildren.  

I have a strong feeling this trip was my last trip up there to see her.  I have peace about that too.  She is 91, after all.  I mean...I think I am as prepared as I can possibly be for her death.  She has lived a very long and full life.  She wants to go home.  She is ready to leave this earth.  She is miserable and feels she is being a burden to my aunts and grandfather.  

I can honestly say my only bad spot in this is I can't be there to help them with her and I won't be there for her funeral.  Though being there for the funeral is simply me wanting something unnecessary.  

My poor aunt is there day in and day out, cooking for them and cleaning, taking care of their medical needs and being a nurse in every sense of the word.  She takes Grandma to doctor visits and all that goes along with caring for an elderly parent.  

I am glad they finally got to meet Jonathan.

Anyway...it was a good trip.  Spending time with my yankee relatives is always fun no matter what circumstances bring us together.  The ONLY bad spot was being crammed into a minivan with my parents and three children.  The smell is enough to kill a person, I swear!

That and I missed my husband like crazy.  :(

I need a drink."

Coke Blak probably isn't the best drink to have when you feel a tummy bug coming on.

That or it really doesn't sit well with me.  The taste wasn't all that bad.  It's one of those that has to grow on you I think.

No more for me thankyouverymuch!"

i have tried to LJ a bunch of times before, but i have to always stop because i feel like it's not worth it.

the last couple months have been crazy. i'm really emotionally drained

i have come to the conclusion that caring for people just doesn't get you anywhere. it just leaves you vunerable to getting hurt. and it happens to me. 

every.

time.


i try to separate myself from people for that same reason, and they get mad at me. and then i get really sad because i care about them so much and i can't bear them getting mad at me.  

the worst is that i can't gauge how much people care about me.


i'm really fucking incoherent right now

"event","it's really weird how i had that weird dream about death the night before mckay passed on. i called corbin about it and told him about it, he had a dream like that too- except the exact opposite from mine. no one found out until a day later, apparently. it makes me really curious about death, but it doesn't make me any less scared. i wonder where people go after death, what they do. it's weird how we don't know at all. we think we know why the world turns or what the twinkling stars so far off really are, but why does that even matter. like what is life, you know? it's all just so surreal- physics, events, news, activities, improving yourself. where does life play a role in all of this? why is there suffering why is there pain. does what you do on this earth really matter in the end? what makes life actually unique? It's simply scary to think of what will happen after you stop breathing. what are you going to do after you die. what you will become. where do people go? do we just.. stop? everyone dies. but what does that mean? it's unfortunate that these age old questions still and will not be answered until the human experiences the phenomena.

Must you make me laugh so much

You'll miss your train, and come stay with me
It's always say goodnight and go
We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
You'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
But then the heating may be down again
At my convenience
We'd be good, we'd be great together
Go

congratulations on turning 16, lovely.
I'm really glad i met you this year and i think we have become totally close. My first memory of you ever was when we were in lab and i had skittle gum because the black guy who refills the thingy gave me soem for free. You asked for one. hahah;dfalfsdha youre so cute. As the debate season progessed on, we became better and better friends. Even though SCU was a shitty tournament because of the whole auto-drop thing.. and well, the tournament in general- you still made it way fun. I remember once before VBT me you and sophia were on the phone and you read your cases and asked us to flow/give you feedback. youre such a nerd, goshh. haha, even though i wasnt physcially at VBT, we pretty much were on the phone nonstop- and gagan probably still thinks were married. i think him him and her her and her and him know who they are now. struggle. But ""t00p1nk"" was classic. it provided good times, and so did he. hahaha i still have those conversations saved. i wonder if he still remembers who tasha and sasha are. oh DEAR sasha. i like how long that infatuation lasted. hahaha okay this is getting so off topic.

the main point is, i love you lucy chen. i hope this year brings many more scotts and justins and hollister sadies'. have a great 16th year, sweet heart."

the weather today is so nice, i just came back from a really nice walk.
what a lie.(the walking part. hahahah sophia)

i just woke up, actually 
read: retarded sleeping pattern
but that doesn't mean i don't want to take a walk.. where are you winston? i miss you. and we need to renew our walks. i havent talked to you about CL or anyone oh dear please come back. now i know what it's like when i'm not home :(

i really didn't want to get up today. but none the less i felt really flirtatious. specially this week. i wonder why- specially because i know that i like one certain person. i'm not going to tell him though, because it's way too soon.

the multicultural assembly was the best. and of course, the highlight was my one and only COURTNEY. yes, your outfit was really laughable. and yes, i laughed after i saw you- but not to your face. you still looked adorable. and you did so great; i love you to death courtney-bell. 

and i also felt really really lesbian when the tahitian dancers came on

but i have to say- wathcing all the msj senior boys dancing bhangra was one of my most favorite memories. gagan gagan gagan. you are SO SILLY. i love it though. you knwo what i love more? YES FOR BLACK PEOPLE DOING BHANGRA.

my mom stole one of the rubber bands on my writs. not theyre uneven. i need to get more. why do i keep these on my wrists?
you know what i miss? davids bracelet that he gave me at winterball. i can't belive i broke it. damnit

i hung out a lot of sophia today. i can't belive we havent hung out since like last week. it seems like an eternity. i don't think i have patience, but thats okay. we were eating brownies and milk.. and then i got really mad at her for never being mad at me. she said she never had a real reason to. it would be so much easier is she got mad at me- i wish she did. she said she probably would around NSD time. because i probably would leave her for vini and sophie. and not work. and she said that i would be wasting everything that we worked hard for. i'm anticipating nsd so much, you don't even know. like, sophia knows me so well. it was really funny because i agreed with her when she was telling me this. but that's not going to happen, and she knows that. simply because i really, really want to get good at debate. i bet you guys hella think im whack but whatev- i frankly don't give a shit. i guess all i can do is wait and see what happens. after this me and sophia fell asleep next to eachother on my bed reading cosmo (or cosmo >girl< because i dont want to dirty sophias mind) she always sleeps on the left side because i only sleep on the right one. i think she likes my wall too or somthing. whatev- its cute. :)

i seriously cannot wait until the next party. sigh 7 more days. my 4/2o was quite uneventful with the exception of william, that silly boy.

spanish is fun with will. i canNOT belive that vernon let me, amina, vik, will, ben, AND ryan sit next to eachtoher. these couple of weeks are going to be rock out<3. if amina can keep her goddamn mouth shut. HAHAha much love gurlie. oh dear who do i think i am


shrija is currently in baltimore, i miss her. courtney is at a track meet right now. i hope she does really well in her pole vaulting. ultimate frisbee was wayyy fun. i could not take jenna though, that girl- oh lord. i love her so much but the animal sounds were just too much. me and courtney were fine with making sex noises thanks.  plus the day seemed so much longer for some reason

i really want to see an indian movie

i still havent seen veer zara(i know, kill me now)

i'm sorry if this Lj entry lowered your IQ

HAHA JK IM NOT BECAUSE I KNOW YOU LOVE ME<3333


why am i so funny??

"event","Well, today was Day of Silence. i felt really, really good participating in somthing i truely belive in; and im happy my peers are participating in the same movement. I also have to admit, it was way hard not to talk. When i showed people

they started flipping the fuck out. yeah, i know. rashmi rikhy, not talking, for an entire DAY!? dawgg, hella unheard of. I'm not going to pretend that I didn't slip up, because i did. a total of 3 times. and then an outburst afterschool, but i'm getting to that.

and and YES i think im cool because i think the pic of my vow is way emo.

My sweeties court, shrija, and jenna made slips exactly like me and they aren't talking for the rest of the day either. that made me feel awesome because they understood what i was doing, and supported me wholeheartedly through it.

i began to really appriciate it when i kinda went crazy by 6th per. sophia and will hughes jessica sharon ect ect kept talking to me in english, and i couldnt talk to them or like.. communicate at all. Sharon kept biting jessica and trying to talk to me. ms. johnson got mad bc she thought i was breaking my vow of silence. but i really didn't. that sucks cuz i really respect ms johnson as a teacher too. i was just doodling on some paper the entire time, and 2 mins before the bell rang i subconciously starting ripping it. jessica called me emo and i died laughing. 

sophia was being the worst today, she kept trying to make drama with me. and, as much as i hate to say it, i flipped out and starting yelling at her. she yelled at me. imm actually mad at her. which is weird cuz i have never been before. she was like ohh i lost respect for you bc you dont wear your debate band anymore. WHAT THE FUCK!?

edit:
sophiastication: um the no talking thing is a joke
Aaj Ki Ju1ieT: huh
sophiastication: you not talking
Aaj Ki Ju1ieT: im confused
sophiastication: shrug
Aaj Ki Ju1ieT: i think i just got it
Aaj Ki Ju1ieT: that was
Aaj Ki Ju1ieT: SO FUCKED UP
Aaj Ki Ju1ieT: fuck you
Aaj Ki Ju1ieT: what the FUCK
Aaj Ki Ju1ieT: i cant belive you said that

..this time, i'm not going to be the first one to say sorry

on he other hand, some people were really sweet.

david knew i couldnt talk today cuz i showed him my paper, and after 6th i saw him and he made a heart with his hands and waved.. it was cute

after school winston knew i couldn't talk so he made half a heart with his hand and i made the other half with my hand. that was way awesome tambien

oh, that's another thing. everyone kept saying hi to me and i could only wave. that was kinda icky sigh. so i did the Nick wave and the Jessica wave.. yes, it was alternating. see this is what i do when i can't talk.

do you realize this means no phone for the rest of the day? do you like, REALIZE WHAT THAT MEANS?!

i sent pics of my Day of Silence Vow to VBD, i hope they post it! that would be way awesome

till next time my lovelies<3

oh PS. i can't wait for this weekend.

P.S.S i am very, very sad that R&J is over. i don't know what i'm going to do when i can't walk into E2A every day at 20 to 2."

"event","I watched Finding Neverland this weekend (good movie!).

Hook happens to be on AMC right now, so it got me wondering. I understand the whole travelling to Neverland in your imagination thing... but if grown-up Peter in Hook is all adult and serious now, how did he end up back in Neverland? Is it that his imagination never went away? Why doesn't he remember Neverland? Am I overthinking this and/or am I not thinking straight because I'm sleep deprived?"

"event","Wow, it's been awhile since I've written in here.

You know, I think taking two classes this semester&nbsp;and staying at home is the best thing I could've done for myself right now.&nbsp; I actually feel happy again.&nbsp; I'm joining extracurriculars, I'm getting enough sleep at night.&nbsp; I feel like I can look around and breathe and I'm not trapped in that place where I'm totally overwhelmed.&nbsp; I feel like I'm back in control&nbsp;of what I'm doing instead of&nbsp;floating along, pretending to get it but soooo not getting it.&nbsp; This might not make sense if you're not me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowing down has helped me rebuild structure in my life too, I think.

Of course things aren't perfect but I feel much better than I did a few months ago.&nbsp; I think the key is to keep my mind occupied without overwhelming it.&nbsp; Just keep a balance.&nbsp; Do what I want to do, instead of what others think&nbsp;I should be doing.&nbsp; But at the same time, I have to have enough self-discipline to know when to tell myself to toughen up and stick it out because the end result will be worth it.

I know now that I'm going to be okay."

"event","I wasn't planning on writing in here at 1 AM when I have to be up at 7 AM to go to court with my dad and then work at the office tomorrow.

I just wrote out a huge entry and I'm pretty bummed that I accidentally erased&nbsp;it all&nbsp;but I want my voice heard now that I've put out all of this effort, so here we go again.

My trip to California came and went so fast.&nbsp; I was so glad to get out of Michigan for a bit and see something new.&nbsp; It most definitely refreshed my perspective.&nbsp; It really made me see myself living out there one day.&nbsp; As much as I wanted to never get back on that plane home, and live out there forever, I know I'm not ready quite yet.&nbsp; I've still got business to take care of here first.&nbsp; Someday I will live within close driving/walking distance to the beach.&nbsp; It will be amazing.

My favorite moment was the drive through Napa and into San Francisco.&nbsp; Maybe I'll share it in detail later, but it was AMAZING.&nbsp; I hope I never forget it.&nbsp; I also won't forget the crazy adventure on the way to get me home.&nbsp; It started with a car accident and ended with us being stranded at midnight and winding up in a hotel for the night.&nbsp; I couldn't believe so much crap could happen to two people in such a short period of time.

The first couple of days back home, I slept for 12 hours or so... it took a minute to get re-adjusted but soon enough, I was thrust back into my normal life.&nbsp; It's been pretty crazy.&nbsp; B's team is head to the state finals (!!!), M graduated (!!!!) and I've been helping plan his open house, the puppy of course takes up my time, I've been working at the office and I was just hired with the DJF (!!!!).

I saw A on Sunday, for the first time since K's funeral.&nbsp; It's been almost 2 years.&nbsp; The reason I'm still awake and the reason I came on here is because seeing him in one instant brought up so many feelings and memories and also a lot of realizations.&nbsp; As much as I do want to explain everything on here, I'm getting tired and I don't even know where to begin.&nbsp; I've been obsessed with India Arie's cover version of Heart of the Matter (the Eagles/Don Henley) lately and one line really stuck out to me:&nbsp; ""The more I know, the less I understand.""&nbsp; I'm just going to leave it there for tonight.&nbsp; He just doesn't go away.&nbsp; No matter how long it's been, he doesn't go away.&nbsp; He haunts me."

"event","So I realized yesterday that I might be a little depressed.&nbsp; I don't really think it's much to worry about, but I'm determined to pull myself out of this funk.&nbsp; I downloaded some yoga podcasts (and one specifically for depression/winter blues) and I've done it two days in a row now.&nbsp; I'm also going to continue to eat healthier and be more aware of the things I subject my body to.

I feel like getting myself to study and get my school work done will help me as well.&nbsp; Another thing I can work on is getting to sleep earlier.&nbsp; I want to try to turn my thoughts and words around into more positive ones.&nbsp; I'm aware that I've been sort of negative lately so I want to not do that anymore.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Listening to motivating music is also helping somewhat.

"event","&nbsp;For some reason, today felt like the first day of school to me.&nbsp; All the rest of the days have just felt like... I don't know, like I was floating through them.&nbsp; I just wasn't quite there.&nbsp; This semester is going to take a lot of work, but I'm starting to stop panicking about everything and starting to get down to business.

I joined Intermediate French Composition and I think it's the best decision I've made in awhile.&nbsp; My choice to drop music history may come back to bite me in the ass later, but for now I'm happy with my decision.&nbsp; I walked in (I was a week behind) and got that sort of overwhelming feeling.&nbsp; It's like this weird shock of having to adapt to hearing another language and sort of switch your brain over to another language.&nbsp; The class is taught only in French and it sort of makes me mad that I've never had a class taught only in French until now.&nbsp; I would've learned so much faster if I had.

Anyway, I called my mom after I got out of class and talked to her only in French for like 20-30 minutes.&nbsp; I think she was really happy and surprised.&nbsp; It made me all warm and fuzzy inside to hear her so happy.&nbsp; Haha, cheesy.&nbsp; But my main motive for taking this class is being able to speak with everyone at my family reunion in Summer 2009.&nbsp; I'm now considering going to France this summer for some time and doing one of those immersion programs and possibly getting some little job there for a couple of months.&nbsp; My mom told me my dad would likely be willing to send me there.&nbsp; Yesss!

It's nice to have things to look forward to, otherwise life gets really dull and boring."

"event","I'm ready for a change in my life.&nbsp; As much as&nbsp;change scares me, I'm&nbsp;starting to feel ready for a new start.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess no better time to feel that then at the new year.

I feel like it's time for me to really step up.&nbsp; I want to become that fire-spitting, in-control girl that I know I have inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been her before and I want to be her again.&nbsp; What holds me back?&nbsp; Fear.

I'm watching the Grand Ole Opry on TV right now and I really feel like going back to Nashville this summer.&nbsp; It's hard to know where I'll end up.&nbsp; I can see myself living in Nashville, Chicago, New York... I really want to travel.

This has been the thing I've been battling back and forth inside.&nbsp; One of the most important things I learned in my Music Business II class last semester that in the music industry, the greater the risk, the greater the chance for failure, but if you succeed, the pay-offs are incredible.&nbsp; I want to take that big risk.&nbsp; I want to follow my dreams.&nbsp; I've got my dad on my shoulder as my little Jiminy Cricket though.&nbsp; He wants to see me in a stable job that would 'cater' to a future family lifestyle.&nbsp; I can understand that and part of me wants that too, but while I'm young, I just want to chase my dream.

Okay, new goals for 2008:

- Develop and stick to a gym habit.
- Continue to work on my photography and continue to learn about PSP.
- Figure out a career path.
- Do well in my classes this semester.
- Get at least 8 hours of sleep per night.
- Expand my music tastes.&nbsp; Especially check out more country, jazz and world music artists (including sub-genres).

More long-term goals I've realized are to study vocal jazz and guitar.&nbsp; As much as I want to do those things, I know I have a lot of other stuff that requires my attention right now, so maybe sometime in the future."

"event","So this weekend has been mostly spent inside (except for Friday).&nbsp; It's been cold and wintery weather, so I'm happy to be snuggled up in my bed. 

This weekend was mostly spent thinking.&nbsp; That sex talk really shook things up inside (in a good way) and I feel changed by it.&nbsp; It changed the way I see a few things inside myself, how I want to be, and the way I see others.&nbsp; All of this thinking has brought up some more questions that I don't have answers for yet, but I know they will come to me with a little patience and time. 

All in all, I'm in a good spot right now.&nbsp; I feel like I'm finally healing wounds I thought were already mended but I guess weren't.&nbsp; I feel like comforting myself.&nbsp; I also wish I had another person that I care about here to comfort me and ease my fears.&nbsp; But if there's one thing I've learned, it's that sometimes the only person you have to lean on is yourself.&nbsp; As bad as I do want to trust him and lean on him, I'm afraid to make myself vulnerable and get hurt.&nbsp; I'm going to stop thinking and analyzing and just feel it out. 

My best friend showed to me why she is my best friend.&nbsp; I wrote in here about something that I thought we'd talked about before, but I guess not.&nbsp; Anyway, she brought it up and I told her everything.&nbsp; It was such a relief to not feel judged or that the way she thinks of me hasn't swayed because of what happened.&nbsp; She also helped answer&nbsp;one of the two questions I've asked on here before.&nbsp; Before, I was thinking, ""well, any friend would say that of course they would be there.""&nbsp; But it was the way she said it, more than what she said.&nbsp; So calm and confident and I knew she was right and I could put all my trust in her.&nbsp; Thanks H for being my best girl and sister.&nbsp; I love you forever! :)"

Damn, I really wish I could go back in time to visit&nbsp;my 13/14/15/16/17 year old self&nbsp;and hug her and talk to her and listen to her.&nbsp; Be the big sister that she needed.&nbsp; I think the best thing I can do is be a good big sister to B but sometimes I don't think that she needs or wants me.&nbsp; It makes me regret pushing her away when I was 12/13/14 and insecure with myself and couldn't believe someone could idolize me the way she did.&nbsp; Now I miss it like hell.&nbsp; Hey B, I'm an awesome person!&nbsp; I see it now and it's okay to look up to me like that again! 

I studied with cute boy tonight.&nbsp; I don't know where it's going, if it's even going anywhere but I felt good and comfortable about tonight.&nbsp; The only nervous energy I had was excitement, so that was good.&nbsp; I remembered to be myself, that's an important, basic step lol.&nbsp; Another basic step I remembered was to breathe.&nbsp; That's always good too.&nbsp; I can't get enough of him, I want to spend way more time getting to know him.&nbsp; He caught me smiling at something cute he was doing and he started laughing.&nbsp; Which was even more cute.&nbsp; GAH!&nbsp; Puppies, rainbows, cotton candy and unicorns!&nbsp; Too effing cute.&nbsp; Okay enough with the teeth-rotting gooey sticky sweet shit for tonight.&nbsp; There's more where that comes from... we're studying again tomorrow too.&nbsp; Haha. 

Bed.&nbsp; Sheets.&nbsp; Pillow.&nbsp; Time for sleep.&nbsp;

Edit:&nbsp; The night I wrote that note about JK, my friend who died, I posted&nbsp;a note to him on his myspace:

""My little sister just came back from Kairos tonight and sitting in the religion quad back at Powers brought back a flood of memories. I shared with my little sister my memories of you at 4th day meetings, which was how I got to know you. I think tonight was the first time it really hit me that you're actually gone.

If there was one thing I would want you to know, it would be that your presence on this earth impacted not only your family and close friends, but many more people than you may have realized. Even though you were only in my life for a brief moment, I was touched and inspired by you and I will never forget you and your amazing smile. ""&nbsp; Rest in peace, JK."

I like the conversations with my dad when he talks to me like a grown-up or one of his friends.&nbsp; Sometimes it feels like he's really respecting me and getting to know me as a person, instead of telling me what to do or telling me I'm doing things wrong.&nbsp; He came to Detroit for one of his cases and was going take me out to lunch but when he heard I had that stomach thing, he said no.&nbsp; I was kinda bummed, I was excited a family member was nearby.

As much as I love being on my own down here and having all of my friends and aquaintences, I really love my family and I miss them a lot when I'm gone.&nbsp; I am always so happy to come home.&nbsp; Even though we fight and get on each others' nerves, there is something so comforting about home.&nbsp; I really miss my kitty too, I can't wait to see him.

I'm excited that I feel like I'm putting my life back together.&nbsp; I'm organizing study dates with friends, I would like to get tutors so I don't fall behind, and I've already got my weekend plans.&nbsp; Friday, H's meet and dinner with her family.&nbsp; Saturday, B's coming down?&nbsp; and Sunday, I'm trying to coordinate plans with my friend H.&nbsp; We've been talking about going to her fave restaurant for like a year now.&nbsp; So we may do that and then she's going to show me her apt. because I might rent it from her parents when she moves to California."

I'm also trying not to let personal things distract me.&nbsp; I know better than to try and push them aside or bury them, but at this moment I really don't want to deal with them.&nbsp; However, it's not exactly working and I've been feeling this little ball in the pit of my stomach.&nbsp; I don't really feel like this is something I want to share with my friends at this time, so I plan on heading back over to my therapist to work it out.&nbsp; The question is when.&nbsp; I know it's up to me, but I don't know if I want to get my head out of the sand.&nbsp; Talking about it makes it ""real"" and I know I will have to deal with whatever comes along with that. 

Photography has been such a creative release for me.&nbsp; The best purchase I've made has been my camera.&nbsp; I did have a bit of buyers' remorse about a month after buying it, but I think everyone feels that to some degree.&nbsp; I've become pretty comfortable with the camera now and I'm excited to continue to take photos and expand my knowledge and creativity."

Morons. I loved Parissa's mom's advice to her. It was something about how there are nice people and mean people in the world and you must learn that you can't change them, and it's not your job to change them.

"event","Yesterday was a rollercoaster day.  I stepped on a piece of glass.  It wasn't big but it hurt like hell and my foot was dripping blood everywhere.  I could feel each millimeter of glass pierce my skin, like in slow motion.  Then later I had a flashback of it happening and imagined that happening if I swallowed the glass and almost had a panic attack while driving.

Then, on my way to T's house, I got pulled over for the first time.  I thought the limit was 45 as it had been up until the last stoplight, but I guess it went down to 40.  On top of that, I asked my dad for our new insurance proof just a couple of days ago and he wouldn't give it to me.  So I was riding around without a proof of insurance or registration.  I was scared that the hot cop wouldn't let me continue driving but he was nice and told me how to fix the problem.

I went with T to Eastern Market, to a jazz club called Bert's.  My duties were exactly what I used to do with the radio station, so I felt very comfortable doing that all night.  I just felt awkward sometimes because T sort of left me behind to mingle with the DJF big-wigs.  I was kind of intimidated and in a shitty mood.  After the glass and the cop, I just wanted to go home and curl up in bed.  But G and I started talking at the end of the night and she made me feel better and made me feel welcome and comfortable in the DJF team.

This old, old, old black guy dressed head-to-toe in a red pimp suit was in the crowd.  When I went around to collect the entry slips, he and his old-man friends kept me sitting with them for like 10 minutes.  He kept talking to me and asking me questions but we were sitting at the first table against the stage and I could't understand a word he was saying.  He asked me what my sign was and I said ""Taurus"".  His face lit up and he gave me a high-five said, ""I'm a Scorpio!  What day in May?""  and I said, ""13.""  He said, ""I'm 14!  You're a Taurus girl and you should always go for a Scorpio guy.""  LOL.  He had a diamond in his tooth.  It was crazy.

After I got up and went back to the DJF table, he got up on stage and did a DEAD-ON impression of Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World""!  Then he put the microphone on the floor and started tap dancing.  All I could think about was my grandma and how cool she would've thought that was.

I've been researching digital cameras and it's come down to two.  I'm dying to get one but I'm holding off because I may now have to pay a fine for my ticket, and I need to start ordering books for school.

With the money I've saved over the summer, I would like to take a trip (spring break?) to one of a handful of places.  Los Angeles to see what it's about and see if I could see myself living/working there someday.  Florida to relax and catch up with an old friend, and New York to shop and do non-touristy things.  I've done that the past three/four times I've been."

"event","It was tonight at a meeting for the DJF that I really realized that I'm going to be okay (in my career).  They say that getting to the ""top"" involves what you know, who you know and just plain dumb luck.  I think whatever force out there (God, the universe, etc.) has been storing my luck somewhere until the right moment and has been starting to dish it out a little at a time.

I sat in that meeting tonight incredulously thinking, ""How in the hell did I get here?"" and finally I felt like I'm really starting to carve a path for myself.  I spent all of my life up until WSU feeling frustrated and trapped and eager to get the ball rolling on fulfilling my lifelong dream.

I realized on the drive back that one day I hope I can be a role model for younger girls like I once was (and still am).  I imagined myself down the line, successful in my career, talking to younger girls and giving them the advice I'd wished I'd known but had to learn the hard way.  It felt good in my head and I hope I'm able to do that someday.

One thing I'm proud of is how determined I've been to get to this point.  I've heard a lot of negative things from people but I've stood my ground.  I won't back down.

Another thing I'm proud of is my business confidence.  I just KNEW when I nailed that interview that I would get the internship.  I mean, I was still blown away (and continue to be today!!) when I heard I got it, but I don't know if I've ever had such confidence in my life."

"event","I've been in a pissy mood all weekend.&nbsp; Part of it is because of the drama that went down with B that lead to the cancellation of my Chicago trip.&nbsp; I know everyone's noticed I've been defensive and snappy.&nbsp; I feel bad for pushing everyone away but I feel like I just need to be alone for a bit.&nbsp; Another reason is that my anxiety is starting to come back now that school is just around the corner.&nbsp; It's not really rational, but I have all of this anxiety surrounding WSU.&nbsp; I'm mostly fine at home, compared to WSU.&nbsp; I wonder if it just has to do with D-town or if it's being away from home or what.<br /><br />I'm ready to pass the torch of working on to someone else (like my mom lol).&nbsp; My dad snapped at me for no reason today which left me <u>furious</u>.&nbsp; Things got better once I made it to my destination (I was running court docs) and once I got back home, but the last phone call I received for the day turned out to be the rudest.&nbsp; Damn, I think I'm holding on to it for no real reason at all, but it just got under my skin and left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the day.<br /><br />Okay, I'm ready to end this day and hopefully tomorrow will be better."

"event","<p>Well, I had expectations for this summer and now that it's more than half over, it didn't turn out the way I thought.&nbsp; Of course I don't think things ever turn out the way you expect them.&nbsp; I know that.&nbsp; It's just interesting to look back and see your expectations and how you've grown and things have changed.&nbsp; And I can say that I definitely have grown.<br /><br />I feel like this summer is the true start to an adult life for me.&nbsp; Even though I'm back at home, and I thought I was going to regress in my growth progress, I've surprised myself and hopefully those around me by showing them how much I have grown by age 21.&nbsp; I think now I have to remember not to rush things and try to grow up too fast.&nbsp; I still have the urge to act stupid (for the sake of it) and live young while I am young.<br /><br />I'm so proud of myself for saving up the money I have this summer.&nbsp; After I graduated high school four years ago, I made around $6,000 from my open house.&nbsp; I shouldn't have gone as crazy as I did with it.&nbsp; By the time I got to Wayne State, that $6,000 diminished so quickly and at one point, my savings were down to around $150.&nbsp; Working where I do, tens of thousands of dollars (sometimes in cash!!) pass through my hands and I'm not daunted, but I'm able to appreciate earning that $100 and making the decision of what percentage I'm allowing myself to spend and what percentage I'm going to put in savings.&nbsp; I think the most fun thing I've learned this summer is about finances and money.&nbsp; I can't wait to open my money market account and watch my money grow.&nbsp; They say Tauruses are really obsessed with money, and while I've always liked having money (who doesn't?), I never really got that part of my astrology until now.&nbsp; I'm not obsessed but I take a great interest in money and I think I'm good at it and&nbsp;that it's fun.<br /><br />I'm also learning how to keep my anxiety in check.&nbsp; It's a baby-step by baby-step process but I'm really trying to channel that anxiety and turn it into excitement quickly.&nbsp; I still have fears and anxieties but I think I accept them more now, I don't try to fight it.&nbsp; I feel like I have an inner source of calm that I tap into when I'm freaking.&nbsp; I think therapy was really beneficial for me, so I think I will return in the fall to keep myself in check and continue to grow.<br /><br />K died around a year ago this week and I was completely numb to the reality until this week, for some reason.&nbsp; Of course I <em>knew</em> he was gone, but it didn't seem to register in my heart until now.&nbsp; I felt totally numb at the funeral.&nbsp; His body looked like a wax figure.&nbsp; I never felt sad, or even anything about it.&nbsp; This week he's appeared in my dreams at least once and maybe&nbsp;I should look at it in a more positive light but it's kind of haunting.<br /><br />I had another dream where J died and I was absolutely devastated.&nbsp; In real life, I think our friendship has died.&nbsp; And if for some reason I'm being paranoid, there are some serious problems with it.&nbsp; Reading this book called ""On Becoming Fearless In Love, Work and Life"" has made me see clearly where things went wrong.&nbsp; I don't know what the future holds for our friendship, but maybe it's better off this way for now.&nbsp; I'm not going to fight this either; whatever happens, happens, but I'm not going to lie that sometimes it hurts.<br /><br />I realized tonight that the heart isn't a bone to be broken or shattered.&nbsp; It's a muscle that can be stretched, torn, sprained but it keeps flexing.</p>"

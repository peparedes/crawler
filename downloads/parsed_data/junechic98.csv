I don't want just anyone to hold
I don't want my love to go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul
You're the one I wanna chase
You're the one I wanna hold
I won't let another minute go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul

I know that you are something special
To you I'd be always faithful
I want to be what you always needed
Then I hope you'll see the heart in me"

There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents 
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
All I want for Christmas
Is you...

Merry Christmas..."

"event","First of all I would just like to say that the stuff i put in my live journal ( THE QUIZZeS) are simply for your amusement! There is no meaning behind them whatsoever! lol! Mrs. Kelley I deleted the TWo quizzes just for you! 

Anyway, today was...wow. It was the last day of school for the first semester! WOOHOO! It was so fun! We had a party in Government and then did nothing in the majority of my classes! Then we had a special senior dessert from out WONDERFUL senior moms! It was so great! THEN... We found out about the play...YIKES! First of all, waht i said in my journal acouple days ago.. that ""All **** would break loose"" if a certain someone got the lead part, GUESS WHAT??? SHE DID! AHH!! Im  not all that upset with my part because I got Miss Hannign but still...i feel bad for my friends that DESERVED really good parts and didn't get them. I mean, me as Miss Hannign? THat just doesn't fit me...lol not type casting. I dunno...its gunna be an awkward week in January when we get back to school. But oh well... We are all just going to make the best of it. 

Oh boy, guess what i get to do Tomorrow morning at 8! Take the ACT! Oh yea...lol so I should be going to bed! Wish me luck and EVERYONE have a great holiday season! Oh and Mrs. Kelley, I'm really gunna miss your class! It was fun! lol! night night!"

"event","In the moonlight
When the shadows play
When the thought of what could happen
Takes your breath away
Silent whispers
Quiet laughter in the air
Unspoken invitations everywhere
In the moonlight 
All the words you say
Make it relatively easy
To be swept away
In the half light
Can we trust the wa we feel?
Can we be sure that anything is real?"

"event","Trying out for the musical is possibly the most tiring, frustrating and time consuming thing at Hp for extracurricular activities. Plus...The directors granddaughter is in the choir and is trying out for a big part...hmmm.. and I defiantly saw the director(grandmother) and the mom talking SECRETIVELY about the musical..seems fishy to me..but I'm just gunna let it go..but if that girl gets a better part than anyone of the juniors or seniors...all hell will break loose! Man I feel much better! :)

Today was quite pleasant...just very relaxing and not much going on...its prob. because i dont have to take all but 3 finals...ya..its nice. But we still have to do the reviews...oh well..better than taking the final! AND me, court, anna, and sarah have ALL decided to play SOFTBALL!! WOOHOO!! Even though none of us have played before and haven't the slightest clue what we are gunna do. Haha, i dont even know how to catch with a glove on... YIKES! OR BAT! haha oh well, it will def. be a blast! Let's just hope we HELP the team and not HURT them. 

Callie and Sarah....""Some women are drippin' with diamonds, some women are drippin' with pearls. Lucky me, Lucky me, look at what i'm drippin' with , Little GIRLS"" Oh man...good times...we are gunna have fun this next year! 

Oh man, we are almost HALF way through are senior year... Its almost 2005! Wow! It's def. going by quicker than I thought it would...

So I MOST DEFIANTLY think i found a hobby, yes, my LIVE JOURNAL! I am prompted by my eagerness to write in this journal everyday! It has become a fetish of mine which some say is ""ridiculous."" But i dont really care because writing in this journal gives me this tranquility that I have had from the last days of entering my life day to day for the eyes of everyone on the World Wide Web. My life isn't that entertaining nor humorous... I mean, it is, but you have to be there in order to get the full amusement out of it. Because, everyone knows, i'm horrible at telling stories, so telling it back wouldnt be funny."

"event","He drowns in his dreams
An exquisite extreme I know
He's as damned as he seems
More Heaven than a heart could hold

And if I tried to save him
My whole world could cave in
Just ain't right

Oh and I don't know
I don't know what he's after
But he's so beautiful
Such a beautiful disaster
If I could hold on
Through the tears and the laughter
Would it be beautiful
Or just a beautiful disaster

He's magic and myth
As strong as what I believe
A tragedy with
More damage than a soul should see
And do I try to change him
So hard not to blame him
Hold on tight

I'm longing for love and the logical
But he's only happy hysterical
I'm waiting for some kind of miracle
Waiting so long

He's soft to the touch
But frayed at the ends he breaks
He's never enough
And still he's more than I can take"

"event","Ok, so TODAY was just wonderful! Once again, a blow off day , ha even though practically every day at HP is a blow off, but this week is just alittle extra! I just love missing a class for an appointment, always makes the day go by just alittle faster. 

SO, today, I tried out for the musical! haha I think it was good, except for the fact I jsut got my music yesterday, didnt really know the song and had to sing by memory! Yikes! haha, honestly, i dont really care anymore, if i get a part, then i do, but if i do, then whocares. The world will still go on! lol!

Definitely went to cheer at the basketball games tonight! They were quite entertainnig I might add! The sophmore boys have taken it upon thereselves to take over the traditions of the last year seniors! And man did they do a good job! They obnoxiously scream and make clever comments during the games which just make the game FANTASTIC! I love it! Makes the games actually fun to cheer at because the audience actually CHEERS with you! 

WATCHED THE LAST SHOW OF LAGUNA BEACH!! It was soo good and SURPRISE, they are hacing a season two! WOOHOO!! And its gunna be lots of twists!! SO GREAT! haha well...thats it...lol COURT i just cant beat you!"

"event","Man today a pretty straightforward day! It was mostly pleasant, although...just a few things happened that I didn't intend nor mean to happen, and I'm so sorry, truly I am. I felt like it was said out of context and things just got confused. But then again, I'm glad to know the truth. Anyway, school was pretyy good, my govment project turned out surprisingly well! Our teacher was laughing so hard she was in tears! It was just classic! BUT the person we targeted in our political ad was pretty pissed so hes remaking his ad to target us! Haha but o well! 

Today, I got my piece for the Musical! I'm nervous to try out because I went to listen to some of the other auditions, and WOW, its tough competition! I just get so nervous! AHH! But I got a good piece so hopefully I can belt it out! haha well, im going to try!

So tonight my family is keeping our Tradition alive by decorating the house and tree! My sister, husband and her new baby our coming over for steak and decorating! Its always SO much fun because we pull out the Christmas jams, hot coco, and cookies! I'm grateful for these times because this is my last year at home where we all decorate together. So it kinda makes me sad yet excited!! Our tree, however, isn't so great this year! It's not very big and it's kinda ugly, but it wasn't my fault because my mom INSISTED we buy that one and then realized what a terrible mistake she made! haha, but hopefully the decorations will brighten it up!

Haha, still perplexed about stuff...just wondering what to do and marveling over how to deal with it. I know what I should do...but I still am concerned. Everyday day I compose a new feeling and don't know what to do with it! I mean, it's amazing what songs can do to you, make you feel a certain way, then another song tugs at your emotions in the opposite direction. Man oh man! What a life! :)"

Your smile that shades my heart
Eyes that reveal
And words that conceal
My loneliness in the dark
The seasons pass
The year becomes a new
Still each and every love fades into you
Here I wait steadfast
Yet my efforts go unseen
The moon shows no sign of change
But with every silver beam
I'll repeat my wish
And solemnly pray
You will realize your heart
Belongs with my every day


The evening...hmmm...."

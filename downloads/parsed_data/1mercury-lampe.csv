I wonder what other curse will this city put on us."

"event","I slept in for a long time in my case, hoping this would just be some dream and that I haven't be wound up yet...Of course, I was mistaken. Opened my case yesterday to see if I was back where I was supposed to be and instead I see the silly humans and other beings...speaking in different languages from one another. I thought it was a dream and went back to sleep. Awoke today, and it defenetly wasn't a dream, since everyone seems to be talking about it. Heh, well I'm certainly glad I didn't take part in any of it.

I guess my investigation continues. To try and get out...or to see if my other little sisters are here~ *chuckles*

I'm off to explore the city. *closes her case and flies off*

<b>EDIT</b>- So, I've heard some talk about the <a href=""http://velated-v.livejournal.com/7164.html?thread=84988#t84988"">end</a> of the <a href=""http://velated-v.livejournal.com/7599.html"">world</a>. End of the world? I can't let that happen yet! I have to become Alice! The Alice Game WILL continue! I won't let a stupid thing like this ruin everything! I've got to find a way to stop all of this and get back to where those little runts are! I will not give up due to these news!"

"event","This is certainly a weird place. From ""private investigators"" to a ""lord of darkness""...how interesting. Certainly more interesting than that other place. Heh, even met a little kitten~

But...

Uhnn...why do I feel so tired all of the sudden..? And why am I having...these thoughts?

*stumbles towards her case and opens it*

...it must be this city's doing..!! Unghh...

...I wonder...if this...is how Megu feels...like--

*collapses in her case and it closes shut*

((OOC: A bit of a warning. Bother Suigintou by opening the case and you <i>will</i> get attacked. You'll have the great [/sarcasm] job of putting her back in the case. ;P))"

"event","After finding myself in this never-ending ocean of flowers, I find this odd-looking city. Just where am I?! And why isn't the N. Field working? Does this have to do with that pretentious little sister of mine?! Ugh...how annoying.



<lj-cut text=""[Private to self, Unhackable]"">...wait a second. She took my Rosa Mystica. I wasn't supposed to come back. But here I am...and with a torso?! Father...where are you? What's the meaning of this?

...

Megu...I wonder how she's doing...</lj-cut>



I will not lose! I <i>will</i> become Alice no matter what! I'll have to gather more information on this city.

<b>EDIT</b>- What is this loud ticking noise? It's getting to be...a bit annoying."

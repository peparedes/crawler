"event","SO! my first ever post regarding news about any of the bands i've ever been in! Harvard Division finally has a bassist. Who? Tom. Why? Because he can(we got desperate) but he's good! As of today we have 5 songs, yep 5. I guess we have a show scheduled for January?! I don't know anything about it. Anyone who has the acoustic EP thank you for purchasing that...but, i'm sorry the only song that made it through was...""and the lies continue, my cue to go""...new songs include
Seasonal
Getaway Ohio
the other 2 are still nameless.
umm...i don't have much else to say.

the screen name is Savesthedayoo7 if there are any questions or anything you want to talk about.

Love forever and always,
Shawn ;)"

"event","i can't think of anything except that night: two hours of absolutely nothing when it comes to doing something useful, but we were weightless, as i've said before. he makes me glitter, because he's this, and that, and everything that shines. it seems to me that he could do nothing other than breathe, and i would faint [in my own mind, of course]. i miss that boi, you know, the one i don't even know. i think i just want to taste him, but who knows? i'm not myself these days."

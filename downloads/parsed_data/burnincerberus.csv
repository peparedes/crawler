"event","I need to vent about my car. Not that anyone will care but, yeah. Took about 4  hours today taking every fuckin' terminal and cleaning it all the nuts and bolts all the terminal posts. All the god damn relays I could think of. Shit I even took a wire brush to body ground so hard it burned right through. All in attempts to try an promote some conductivity. So that I can find a short in a wire, or a bad connection. Everything electrical looks brand new now.I've still yet to find the short. New alternator, new battery, new posts , all new connections, and my car is still starving for volts. Cant even fuckin' drive it at night, really. If I do I cant listen to the stereo , so what's the point. As pointless as that entry as it was I still felt the desire to right it. So yeah."

"event","Well I hung out with Case last night for a lil for some cruising in tunes. But some how i managed to get laughed at by more than few people for getting into a tune. Which involves much high pitched notes wild faces, much head banging and,  air guitar o'plenty. Especially at Scheetz where Case pointed at that two chicks were laughing their asses off at my expense. Like i could really give a shit. In the words of Neil Young Rock and Roll can never die. Things are getting worse and my spin on life is deteriorating more and more each day. Getting increasingly hard to put on an illusion of a smile, just to keep the, ""What's Wrong?"", bashing at bay. Case man can somehow squeeze it out of me but thats about it because I pray more and more each day not to wake up period. They say it's always darkest before you reach the light at the end of the tunnel. I just wonder if I'll stray off course and smash into the fuckin' wall before I reach that light. And if Karma does exist I best win the lottery and get gang banged by all the playmates from the last two years."

I sleep from 10 am til 2pm even though its during the day its still only 4 hours , and apparently my mother is under the impression I sleep all day. Fuck that. Anyways yesterday was pretty nice didnt really go anywhere but No one does anything on the weekdays. Incidentally I had a pretty average day at home which was pretty nice. And case yes I know I'm a prick. (excluding Case) If you dont like my attitude you can just kiss my motherfuckin' ass. As i've said to many a people , on your way out dont let the door hit ya where the dog shoulda bit ya."

"event","I thought i'd explain about my new icon. Just incase anyone cared LoL. Took me forever to find, it is the picture I originally wanted as my icon but i thought i'd never find it. About a year ago halloween time i was wearing a my grim reaper costume. It has a mesh screen by the face so that I can see out but no one can see in. Well i managed to get a hit of my smoke and exhale it through the mesh. The result; this picture. Sorry that wasnt a very good opening to my journal. OH and all proceeds go to Ryan Sheridan so if you want this pic you need both of our permission *patent pending*. 

Anyways got to hang out with my best bud  Caseola again tonite, for our usually brew and bullshit combo good times. As we scope the women in perkins and our usual current live event talks. Not to mention no swearing contests I lost the first three with in a minute, but I caught up later that night. Oh and at one point we both were naked dancing on the tables of the smoking section. Needless to say we were promptly repremanded for our actions. My hair is getting super long . yep"

"event","So I got the day off today so to speak. Which turned out to be good anyways because Case has school canceled tomorrow or today. So we went for the usual trip to perkins for our coffee and the bullshit me and him converse. When we noticed the sign closed , we are cleaning our carpets. So we drive all the way to canfield both fuckin' restaurants are doing the same thing. And  in the words of my best friend ""im sure that's good for business."" I agree, good nite though got a break from you know who case. Good to see ya man."

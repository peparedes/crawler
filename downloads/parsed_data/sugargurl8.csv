"event","Today as i was looking over my favorites list on AOL and thinking to myself that i am kinda bored (which is odd for me) i recalled that i had a live journal! So i figured i would enlighten you all with my wonderful life! :)The summer was AWESOME! I enjoyed some rays out in Florida and South Caorlina, not to mention Mexico and Texas. Life was sweet this summer, i finially got the freedom of having a car and driving it places about 3 weeks before school started. It was weird to go to school the first day. My first day was September 11th....the tragic day. I walked into school and it was like nothing was the same. All of the people that were normally walking around and being jerks were all of the sudden changed, they listened to the teachers, didn't cut people off or shove in the halls? IT was like a new school or something? And while all of this was going on i sat and wondered....isn't this what God wanted us to be like in the first place? Caring about one another, living our life not to make fun of people and mock them but together. All of america united on that day! It's like we always talk about being on Nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. But for the past 200 years we haven't been showing too much of that...or at least for my past 16 years of living, people put down other people for the color of their skin, or the size that they wear in clothes, or for reasons not even worth mentioning! IT doesn't matter what we look like or where we are from, we are all Americans and we all deserve the same things. I am the typical blonde/blue eyed, tall american girl. But I have friends from everything! I have indian friends, itialian friends, black friends, white friends...everything! The color doesn't matter, when we are together we aren't black or white we are friends...and that's the dream that so many americans have had of this country but before these past couple of weeks i hadn't seen much of it. Now i drive down the street and every other car has an American flag, i was the the store that other day and this lady payed for my stuff because i didn't have enough money? I know there are always going to be those racist people out there that can't fathom America being united but i say screw them! We'll do it without them and let them live their own lives. Just show other people that they are human beings and that they matter and you'll see that this world can be an awesome place. I'm not saying that we live in fairy tale land....or that we ever will....after all, we have a War on our hands here. But show one person today in the world that you care! Maybe you'll see somethign from it? :)"

"event","Wow! Can you believe that the summer is already here and school is out? IT seems like we have been waiting for this forever doesn't it? Then again we have to leave all of those friends at school behind untill next year then there are those that are going off too college and they might not see most of their friends from school ever again unless they try. But i look back and I'm like where did my life go? Two more years and it's off to college with new friends and new experiences. I think it's crazy! But then again life is full of new experiences! In 2 days i will be leaving for mexico and i have never in my life been so excited about any trip! But there is so much to get ready for it that i think i am going to go crazy. I haven't even started packing but I'm sure i'll do fine! I'll write more when i get back about the trip and what went on then!"

"event","I got a question for anyone out there interested enough to read this. ""Why are so many people fake?"" Like all of these ""Pretty"" girls go walking around with their fake blonde hair, fake blue eyes,fake nails. Is there an ounce of originality in girls nowdays? I'm not trying to say that you have to be goth or freak or anything like that, just be yourself! If you don't have confidence in yourself as a person then how is the world going to look at you? Like take brittney spears, everything about her is fake, I'm sorry if you like her and think she is pretty. I think she would be pretty if she was herself. IT's not only how a person looks either, It's how they act too. They act like one person around one friend and someone else just depending on who they are with. Why can't we all just be honest with each other? Are we afraid that they will reject us because we aren't what they want? If they are like that then we don't need to be with them or even know them. The world needs to accept people, faults and all and maybe the people in the world would open up more."

"event","Life can hurt sometimes and more times than a few life can hurt but the thing is that you have to get up and get over it. Like so much stuff can go on but it's what you do when that stuff happens that really matters. And life is SO confusing! Espceially guys! Man! The past week has been crazy?!? Like one guy likes me one week and it's a new guy the next week. I say forget guys! Friends are always there for you and guys are there to confuse you! The thing is though that guys can be there for you too but you can't have that same closeness with a guy as with a friend? I think it's dumb that it has to be that way but if you become too close with a guy then you start having feelings for him and if you take the risk of going out with him then u have to be willing to put up with the risks! That's just the way it goes and sometimes the risks pay off.
 I can't believe that the school year is almost over! It's like where did the time go? I am almost a Juinor and before i know it i'll be a Sr. and getting ready for college. Looking back i think about my friends that i have kept an lost and think how weird it is? We can never guess who we'll be friends with for the longest. I know that some of my friends will always be there for me! But then others just move on and i moved on too. It's just that we all change so much through the teenage years trying to figure out who we are that sometimes we forget who we used to be and go the wrong way. We have to stay strong and keep our eyes up. Instead of looking at the ground we should be looking ahead at what is in front of us. We can't tell what is coming but we can look forward to each new day with excitement. ""Dont walk in front of me, I may not follow. Don't walk in front of me, I may not lead. Just walk beside me and be my friend."""

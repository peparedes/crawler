I feel like im losing my ""best friend"" or at least she was my best friend..im sure everyone knos who it is so im not even gonna say her name...she is busy with her ""new friends"" she says that she is with them bcuz they are less drama..and my own opinion it is only bcuz they are new friends...every group of friends have ""drama"" eventually...i dont care what anyone says..something is always going on no matter which way u put it!...

well im out im kinda pissed off rite now!

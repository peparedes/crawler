"event","Something someone said hit me kinda hard the other day.&nbsp; I did not appreciate being told by MD that he wouldn't talk to me as long as i was talking to Colin.&nbsp; I wouldn't want to loose either of them, because the whole group of them are ignorant, immature and have problems manning up to be better ppl.&nbsp; We all have our faults but why take your friends and accept them where they are at and then dump them when they cannot stand you anymore......

A real friend will challenge you to reach beyond where you are at because life isn't about staying the same and settling for second best.&nbsp; (I got that from Andy Andrews, kinda. He says the guy at the drive thru of McDonalds can accept you where you are cuz he doesn't care....but your friends should care.)&nbsp;&nbsp;

Well, I was taliking about Colin and complaining cuz I just don't understand our situation.&nbsp; No one measures up to how I feel about him.&nbsp; Its not how cute he is or that he makes me laugh... but a combination of everything that makes up what me happy.&nbsp; But then why aren't we together.......well I got an answer I am not sure I like but am content with for now.&nbsp;.........

At least he love you enough not to get you tangled up in his world and drag you down to his level."

"event","""I'm reaching further than I ever have before, leaving all who broke your heart upon the shore.&nbsp; I may be some sort of&nbsp;crazy, we may be some sort of&nbsp;crazy, but I swear on everything I have and more.""&nbsp; Blue October, Sound of pulling Heaven Down.

I thought this was a weird song, like the rest of the album's lyrics however, I really like this song a lot.&nbsp; It makes you think about liking someone.....and then reaching further to that whole love thing.&nbsp; If you really love someone then you can start to leave hurt behind you.&nbsp; And some of the things you do for each other seem crazy but its worth it.....cuz it is for each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

When I look at happy couples I think wow that is really cool, when they just click other couples seem happy but you can just tell something is missing and you know they aren't over the past, cuz it is not meant to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet some times we force ourselves to make the ideal situation give us butterflies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I see my friends who are married and engaged and I think wow...there are worse things than being single....about a few of them.&nbsp; And others I know its right for them and it really makes me believe there is some one out there for all of us.&nbsp; But before we get to that place we have to be willing to make ourselves be at that level...you know above, that and more place.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Its the being happy in just doing nothing with that person, the everyday life stuff.&nbsp;"

"event","Katie came over and her favorite game is Taboo, just like mine.&nbsp; Matt did not want to be social but I kinda made him come down stairs I needed a partner.&nbsp; Well we kicked ass, by 20 points.&nbsp; We really are a great team when we don't fight.&nbsp; And as strange as it sounds we usually win if we work together and not against each other.&nbsp; It is actually kinda fun.&nbsp; And I think it helped that I mentioned to Colin he had to take personal responsibility today.&nbsp; (I might baby that boy (C), but that doesn't mean I tell him he is never wrong.....he is a lot.&nbsp; And the trouble he is intoday is a perfect example of it.....missing a court date is no one's fault but your own.)

Yeah so I like the whole getting along thing maybe I will mention that to him.&nbsp; He is a lot more fun when he is sober to.&nbsp; I hate mean drunks.&nbsp; Like last night cutting himself and pouring salt on it so the pain could be weakness leaving the body.&nbsp; Whatever that means, its a marine thing.&nbsp; Then I had to cover for him at work this evening cuz he was still hung over.&nbsp; I hate addiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Although if I wanted to get way into it, I would go off on my rant about the amount of scape goating we do to depression and addiction.........lack of creativity in activities is not an excuse for doing drugs, emotional issues need to be dealt with cuz you can't numb them forever, and drugs just don't make you cool!&nbsp; Okay we are out of high school.&nbsp; Cool kids say no...usually.&nbsp; Okay done with the rant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I had a job interview with Target and I think I got the job.....I just have to pass the drug test which should not have been a problem.&nbsp; Its a job atleast.&nbsp; Which is more to do than work with Matt.&nbsp;"

"event","I am sitting in my online class and pointed out a huge mistake, and logically speaking it should have been caught.&nbsp; It pisses me off that I had to find it.&nbsp; But I guess it just goes along with my usual days lately.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And I ask myself why I question and second guess myself when I think everyone else around me is wrong...actually I know they are wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I saw Colin again today nothing special about that, spent $ i do not have getting the oil changed on his&nbsp;truck and putting gass in his truck.&nbsp; I figured he needed it worse than I do.&nbsp; This just majorly cuts into my alcohol fund which sucks cuz well I want to numb my feelings.&nbsp; I tried jogging till I couldn't breath and was exhausted, well that hurt my ankle.&nbsp; So I guess it doesn't numb anything.&nbsp; Anyhow....he thinks his brother might come home tonight...i doubt it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I invited him so see a movie and I think things are getting back to normal, but I am not sure.&nbsp; I can't be honset with my feelings cuz I am to shaken into thinking he will never feel the same.&nbsp; And my heart has been broken way way to many times.&nbsp; But I will admit I miss the way he makes me smile.&nbsp; But I refuse to be the stupid girl that gives till it hurts...oh wait a little to late for that.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Yeah I figured Da Vinci Code was still out so he might want to go see it.....haven't heard back, but maybe C ame home after all.&nbsp; He asked if I had seen Munich...he has it at home....i said I wanted to.&nbsp; Then I said the DaVinci Code wasn't a date....he found that laughable.&nbsp; Fuck it!
I think it is time to move out of this place.&nbsp; I don't care if it is walking out on my feelings.&nbsp; I don't want to hurt anymore.&nbsp; I am sooooo having difficulty blocking out the pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But do I need to...maybe I should have my exit plan in place and say by the way I love you but should I walk away?"

And I am afraid to loose our friendship if I say anything more....what if he doesn't understand what i mean?&nbsp; What if we aren't ready for this?&nbsp; Yes, I have nothing to loose cuz I don't have him and I think things are just a dramatic disaster but I just can't say it.&nbsp; I don't have the strength I don't feel it is the right time.&nbsp;....<br />I called him today at work.&nbsp; And asked about the DaVinci Code, we have wanted to go see it since before it came out and I think it has been an unspoken thing that we were going together.<br />He said maybe, which I took for a no. But he kept asking questions about work.....like we couldn't hang up.&nbsp; Its like it has been searching for an excuse to engage in interaction.&nbsp; Why are we doing this to ourselves and each other.<br />I know fear makes us all do fucked up things and push people away.&nbsp; Yes I am afraid to have this feeling that I can't loose someone.&nbsp; But I can't turn it off.&nbsp; Yes, I am afraid it won't work out in the end, and Yes I know he isn't perfect but no I am not asking him to change who he is.&nbsp; I just want to be the one to let him change what he wants to change.....HE has said it before but can't get there.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><font color=""#ff6600"" size=""1"">I looked away <br />Then I look back at you <br />You try to say <br />The things that you can't undo <br />If I had my way <br />I'd never get over you <br />Today's the day <br />I pray that we make it through <br /><br />Make it through the fall <br />Make it through it all <br /><br />And I don't wanna fall to pieces <br />I just want to sit and stare at you <br />I don't want to talk about it <br />And I don't want a conversation <br />I just want to cry in front of you <br />I don't want to talk about it <br />Cuz I'm in Love With you <br /><br />You're the only one, <br />I'd be with till the end <br />When I come undone <br />You bring me back again <br />Back under the stars <br />Back into your arms <br /><br />Wanna know who you are <br />Wanna know where to start <br />I wanna know what this means <br /><br />Wanna know how you feel <br />Wanna know what is real <br />I wanna know everything, everything</font>&nbsp;<br />Avril Lavegne<br /><br />Okay maybe I am just delusioned by manipulation and successful attempts to get laid.&nbsp; Maybe he is just like any other asshole I meet.&nbsp; But I don't think so.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />SO all I can do is pray that it all works out and that I can have the strength to say what I need to wen the opportunity arises.&nbsp; <br /><br /></p>"

"event","Thus anoher sad story in my no existant romantic love life.  And i don't know what is wrong if its me or whatever.
I know you can't make a person fall in love with you, or have feelings they just don't but you should treat a friend better then leading them on just to get some.  I mean please he could have called it honestly and I may have been game but talking about our connection and ""the little things for eachother"" thats just wrong.

And although I am really hurting and confused.  I am still okay with this and can tell myself everything will work out in the end.  And I can still say he gives me butterflies and that I am not sorry I feel the connection.  
It scares me to death to feel what I feel for him, and have felt for a long time.  I would like to turn it off but its not that easy."

Well I was missing someone for quite sometime and all I wanted to do was know how he was doing.  I found my way thru google and well found his email address and used it.  I got a response and I thought that would be that.  Well now I really miss him, and hearing that he is doing alright makes me really miss him.  And I regret the way things happened.  We were never together and never really dated but he was that guy that was just special.  I miss him so much.  I would go to parties with his friends hoping to run into him.  Even when he had a girlfriend I was never jealous.  A few times he got me home safely after I had way too much to drink. And I just felt alive when he was around and talking to him well there may as well have been no one else in the room.  Well now I want to see him again.  And a part of me thinks that I should just never have sent an email.  I got a response back and we emailed a few times but I dunno."

but i am going to go back to school and i am going to get a certification and get my life on track.  i want kids before 30 or just not at all, so yeah.  i want a new car and i just want someone to matter to.  it was the coolest to hear the truth for once. but still i am questioning was it real?  how much should i hold back, or how much do you judt let someone in cuz you click?  its hard to just click so do you become bff if it fits and not think twice, and pray that if it is meant to be it will all come around right?  

i think this online diary stuff is a great way to allow people to unknowingly view your inner most thoughts.  i dunno.  this is all just crazy.....and what if you find out the one person you were venting about may have actually seen what was written kinda freaky."

I know he has a girlfriend and I am not into that I would never play that game cuz everyone gets hurt.  Even if you don't think you will.  Its not fair to anyone who is involved.  But he just has that smile, and that voice.  His looks are okay, and his body is well he is a little smaller than I like.  But still, he got my mind of Brandon temporarily.  And he made me realize how much I need someone.  But it doesn't matter cuz he is not available.  Then I think what the hell is he a player or is he just on heck of a guy.  

He was asking me about some damn doughnuts tonight and his birthday gift.....(take a trip to the storage closaet I'll give you a birthday present.)  His birthday was a few weeks ago though.  And never ever would that happen.  I was like what you need a damn dougnut I got you a muffin for your birthday.  He said no all i need is to see you today.  And its like WFT?  You have a girlfriend and he kept laying his head on my shoulder while reading the map.  Yeah he is my favorite.  But then again, I have the automatic BFF syndrome.  And maybe he just likes talking to me but the again he might be keeping his options over incase he and his girl start having problems.  I know he has been a big time cheater in the past...we talked about that and generalized sex and stuff one afternoon.  So we got kinda personal.....you know they say once a cheater always a cheater.  

Its just been way too damn long and I miss having someone.  I resent wasting my time and waiting on a so called good one, that I just want a bad boy where I can take a dive and worry about the consequences later, but damn I have a conscience."

"event","went to see Harry Potter today.  It was the first one I have seen, and haven't read any books.  It was very interesting.  I went because I was attempting to be a better friend.  I realize that I have a selfish tendancy to only want to do what i want and show a lack of interest in what other people do.  So I am attempting to be better at understanding and diversity.  I had a very good experience this time.  

I figure I should self improve a little bit, it will make life better.  Get comfortable with my financial situation but not to comfortable and keep my eyes open for ways to settle down and start a family.  I think I am either too selfish about situations or WAY to giving.  I am practicing the balance thing.  Maybe I will stop doing that analyze every little detail and read the fuck into everything.  Somethings just happen and the reason for them is revealed later on...i just have to come to terms with that.

Also I talked to Michael to night...I think it has been like 5 years since I had to take him to the ER for over drinking.  He is starting school in knoxville in january.  one more unbad thing about the place.  I drove thru there to get my sister a few weeks ago.  And wondred if I could ever salvage any good memories or feel like going back.  The we got stuck in traffic for like an hour mid day....how ironic is that?  A chance to stop and think or a chance to get annoyed again?  Who cares.  

I have to get into my pictures and do a scrap book.  Its driving me nuts having all kinds of floating memories that I find at random times.  I just want it in order.  Next weeks to do list.

"event","<P>Lately I have been wondering why I get so angry about some things and why I have been unhappy.&nbsp; I saw this picture that I thought was of Kevron and almost lost it a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Work has driven me crazy for the last 2 years.&nbsp; My family has driven me crazy.&nbsp; A lot of stuff that has made me seem happy has actually probably not been in my best interest.&nbsp; I have atleast quit drinking and stuff.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I have figured out that usually if I am thinking about someone it is a good idea to call them or something. (Colin is a great example) And I have been thinking about this on friend a lot....well I decided that maybe I should try to contact him.&nbsp; And just looked for an email address on the internet and hey what the hell all I had to loose was well nothing.&nbsp; I regret that things got a little bit weird for a little while cuz of too much alcohol, but I am okay with it.&nbsp; I am not angry and never was.</P>
<P>Plus, when I think of him I have this undescribable peaceful feeling in bad memories.&nbsp; Its something I doubt he would ever know.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I am glad that I have that.&nbsp; So I emailed him at work.&nbsp; Even if he doesn't send anything back I will be okay with that.</P>"

<P><FONT color=#339999>But at the same time I still think is there a ""Karma"" factor hanging over me???&nbsp; I doubt it I think I have paid out more than my share of heartbreak.&nbsp; But I don't think like that way.....I want a meaningful relationship....(thats the libra in me) something that can turn into a family and we can be happy...times like these that make me think that happily ever after is a load of crap and if I can't do the meaningful I would take and totally meaningless but absolutely incredible memorable and no strings attached...and again it takes me back to the kitchen...<EM>oh damn if I never had to see him again!</EM>&nbsp; but I think I'll have to be good because the inevitable is that I would have to see him again and it probably wouldn't be that incredible.</FONT></P>"

It felt good to get one stressor out of my life.  I had one good interview with an establish salon this week.  And I have another one on Thursday with another place.  Both of wich I would invite people to come see me at.  I would love to take clients to either.  Not so much the salons I have been at.  So things are looking up.

I feel kinda bad for my sister.  None of her friends asked her what she was doing for homecoming.  So she had no plans.  And it made her sad that her friends forgot about her.  I understand how she feels.  And it kinda puzzles me as to why her friends are that way cuz...she is always outgoing in an unabrasive way and makes everyone laugh.  But when it comes time to do stuff she is forgotten.  All her friends love to have her around, and have fun with her but I dunno.......maybe they just forget her or figure someone else has invited her.  I am going to see Elizabethtown with my two sisters and Kristen tonight.  That should cheer her up...she loves Orlando."

I think of it when I think about Andy, who I started thinking about in the last couple days.  Maybe it was just the idea of almost loosing a friend I hadn't talked to in a long time.  But I made the decision that I shouldn't talk to him anymore because I knew we were never going to be together but we couldn't be just friends.  Its too intense of a relationship that I don't even think we could understand.  I am never okay with his girlfriends and he never acts like he wants to hear about my dates or interests.  But there isn't much of a good reason for that.  But talking to him fucks up my feelings about others.  I was at a point where I couldn't have my feelings messed with.

Matt never calls early in the morning unless he needs a ride or is introuble or needs me to do him a favor.  Well he asked if I was working and informed me that someone had gotten hurt last night.  I figured it was not someone I knew.  But he told me Colin had gotten run over by a car.  I don't think it set in.  I offered to miss work so that I could take him to see him to.  (We haven't talked in over a year and I had wanted to call him this week but figured he didn't want to talk to me.)  Matt said he wasn't sure how bad it was and that he might die.  Then my mom came home and was upset too.  (Our family likes Colin he was an original Matteo's employee.)  I almost cried and I almost cried on my way into work.  But I went cuz Matt said I didn't need to worry.  He and I would go back later to the hospital.

My mom called me later to say he was in okay condition it was his leg and he had been in surgery for that.  And I think that is when it sank in how much I actually care about Colin, as a friend.  It is a weird sort of connection.  He has always had this way of just making me smile.  He has always been a friend.  And dispite his rough edges he is a really good person.  (with a bad temper) He can just look up across the room and smile at me if I was mad and I would start to laugh.  He cheats at cards and drinking games and everyone cracks up.  

At ""mattapalooza"" he was hittin' on this chick and I was wasted.  I said don't want to cock block you.  He said ain't like that girl we're friends first, before any of this.  He said it infront of her.  And I was glad to hear it.  It made me feel really important.  Because we are friends and too many guy friends have made me feel unimportant over a chance to get laid.  I think I would take it really hard if anything happened to him.  I really want him to know I luv him.  And for all I know this is a pile of crap and it was a statement to keep me from going psycho.  And I have a false sense of friendship but oh well."

"event","I had an incredibly interesting weekend.  I offered to help Jenger with the boys this weekend.  So I kinda got to play soccer mom, Tyler had a tournement.

I worked Saturday morning.  Had one apt.  picked the kids up from another parent. took them to lunch and the second soccer game.  Lil' brandon was sick and cranky all afternoon, and fell asleep in the car on the way home.  Keith picked them up earily.  I talked to kristen and aaron and we decided to see a movie.  Then called brandon.  I dunno if I regret it or not.  

Went to see Brothers Grimm...cool movie.  Nothing spectacular, but good.  It was fun to kinda just go out.  Went home and went to bed.  Had trouble getting up, I guess I was just tired.  But got over to get the kids and woke keith up...guess everyone had a long week.

Keith left the check book to go grocery shopping.  So we went to do that and got tyler ready for his game which was over before we got to, someone gave me the wrong time.  So the kids took me to see Valient.  Another cute movie.  Tyler had cut a chunk out of Brandon's hair that morning and Brandon ran and hid from me which scared the hell out of me.  

Then I had a terrible night working at Matteo's.  Went home to sleep.

Had a family day today.  saw matt's house, celebrated katie's birthday, shopped.  I bought a book, I am going to read it.  Then went walking with Kristen for like 2 hours.  

I think I am going to have a good week."

"event","Signs are everywhere.  Sometimes I wonder how many times I have to say if this completely random thing happens I should.....(fill in the blank) I bellieve it makes it a sign but why did I want a sign?  Is is to say I should do something I had every intention of doing anyhow?  Or is it cuz I was hell bent on doing something because I am supposed to do it, I just needed to wait on the timing thing."

<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>I made a few dollars at work last week more than usual.&nbsp; Maybe things will start picking up.&nbsp; I just have to wait.&nbsp; To build a clientel.&nbsp; It kinda comes natural I like people, and helping them.&nbsp; A facial is better medicine than a therapist sometimes.&nbsp; And everyone needs a good waxing.&nbsp; (Especially if they relate with those of us who have hairy complexes.)</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>I talked to Marcus for a minute the other day and he always makes me laugh.&nbsp; Talked to my sister Liz at college.&nbsp; She is a little homesick but doing very well.&nbsp; She is a great writer and her teacher knows it.&nbsp; </FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>Decided to teach a CCD class at church with Kristen.&nbsp; My brother is actually going to do it also.&nbsp; I think it will be good for him.&nbsp; he says it may make him go to church as well.&nbsp; He needs something in his life.&nbsp; It should be fun, I like kids and once a week with a class of middle schoolers will be my fill.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>I helped Jenger out with her boys&nbsp;for 2 days last week.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its fun to take a 3 year old shopping and have all the old lady clerks tell you how precious he is....although he is not mine.&nbsp; My brother wants to take him to be his lost child to pick up chicks.&nbsp; Whatever...he thinks it would be fun, and something boys just do.&nbsp; And I like picking up a 2nd grader too, and hearing about his day.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>One day I attempted to perfect my cooking skills and make a roast in the crock pot.....everyone ate it up.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>Went to work out with Kristen cuz I need it.&nbsp; She motivates me.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>Chrissie called me Saturday all upset cuz both her and her sister may have thyroid cancer.&nbsp; I wasn't sure how to respond.&nbsp; Chrissie and I have a weird relationship where we don't hang out a lot but everyonce in a while we are just the break the other needs.&nbsp; I felt bad thinking about my problems.&nbsp; None of them were life or death.&nbsp; I dunno.</FONT></EM></P>
<P><EM><FONT color=#cc33cc size=4>Dana and I talked a lot on&nbsp;the phone and online...I miss the online chat it up days.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well kinda....I miss the&nbsp;wrecklessness I had in college.&nbsp; But I don't feel bad about my life cuz I have come to realize we all have debt and regret and very few people are ever what we all strive to be in sucess.&nbsp; They have lost goals and make mistakes too.&nbsp; </FONT></EM></P>"

<P><FONT color=#3366ff>I met him thanks to joel, the night he had to be the ""witness"" to chris's car accident and try to look all cool infront of his new frat ""lil"" brother.&nbsp; And in the end I had to save joel and make him look like a not total looser.&nbsp; I enjoyed it when&nbsp;Kelly was around.&nbsp; When ever I was out totally wasted, and ran into him, he had this way of making sure I got home safely.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>One time we were at this hug house party where Dana ended up jumping out the second story window to avoid the cops.&nbsp; I ran into him at, he tried to get me to leave with him and the rest of the TKEs that were there so I would avoid the cops.&nbsp; Instead I just called after having to run from the party to get a ride to drink more.&nbsp; But it was a lot of fun.&nbsp; He saved me from the dumb ass who thought every girl wanted him by taking me to his dorm.&nbsp; Then walked me home cuz blinky wouldn't get me cuz I lost my student ID.&nbsp; I insisted it wasn't necessary but Kelly did.&nbsp; He told me he knew I could take care of myself but he had a sister.&nbsp; Then I fell asleep on his lap watching tv after we finished the last of the liquor in the cabinent.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3366ff>Although he was kind of a stoner he was really smart and ended up getting into vet school at like Georgetown.&nbsp; And he was fun.&nbsp; I just wonder what he is up to these days and i hope he is doing al right.</FONT></P>"

"event","So life is looking even brighter today...not totally but starting to look better and I am starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel.  At work I told my boss how he needed to run a special.  He said yes.  My old job wants me to come back and work there part time.  If I do it will be on my terms.  Because I have to look out for me and thats the way life has to go.  

Taylor reminded me that it was Ryan's birthday very soon. And in a weird way this is about the point when Ryan always pops back into my life.  When things are getting better and I am still a little confused.  He's that friend, the one that is always a near miss at just the right time and I am not sure if it is a good think or a bad thing.  I am indifferent on it.  

Beth and I talked till almost 2 this morning.  We just kinda understand were each other are coming from on certain issues. She is like ""I can't get over Clayton even though he is a Narissist that is incapable of a relationship.

My sisters are all in school....I feel so old at times.  But oh well.  I was looking at the Myspaces of people I went to high school with and not many of them are accomplished much.  So I don't feel so bad.  

I heard some grat stories about my boss today and passed employees.  They made me laught"

"event","I am done being pissy and mad at the world.  I am thinking that the spa industry is rather shady though.  But I am getting some on call work at a few places which is cool.  And I get to help Jenger out with her boys a little bit too.  Kristen taught me how to make some really good fried chicken last night and we baked some cookies.  I like cooking and being domestic. I love working but I don't want to have to do it.  I get bored just sitting even if it is hourly.  I could work 10 hours a day if I could keep busy and make the commission off it.  Its the waiting and building a cliental I can't take but I have to stick it out.  

I get a chance to talk to my sister on line while she is at college.  I am so proud of her that she is away and doing alright so far."

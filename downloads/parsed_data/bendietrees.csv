"event","it's been a while here.

Pictures have been taken, slides have been ordered. They should be delivered by 3pm Friday (yes i shelled out $20 for the next day delivery).

I am trying to stay optomistic but I can't lie and say that I'm not scared shitless. What if none of them accept me?  Then I get to stay in Arizona for a while longer. Haha.  As Dr. Hubbard said...even the worst scenario really isn't that bad. 

Tomorrow I'm meeting up with the girls at Diane's house at 11am for a few hours of practice,  then after that I plan on doing some more compiling for my applications before bellydance class yet again later that nite.  I finally feel like i have been able to reign in this monster at least a little, which is comforting.  But now only a slew of other problems to further address.

There are my personal goals....money issues, some loose ends to tie before i go (if i get to).  Thinking, should I visit people before I go? and who would I visit? the huge cleaning and packing job ahead of me (not that 90% of my things aren't still in boxes from the recent move...haha).

Then of course is the uncertain future. I can spend all day wondering....what will happen with Babylamb?  What will happen with Vanessa?  will we all get to live together in an apartment and have Halloween parties every weekend and go out drinking and laughing and laying on the grass and looking at the stars at night? will we get to go to shows, and create our own clothes, and have pet kittens and a turtle?  I want it to happen so badly.  It will be so hard, not being with Miss V for a while, but we can find ways around that.  thank goodness for the magic pants. hahaha

it's almost one and i gotta get up sorta early to be prepared for practice tomorrow. i'm pretty sure i've said most of what i've wanted to.  it's nice to do this again."

I realized that when someone likes me alot, I start to feel sad.  i'm not sure why exactly! if i could just get it through my head that i deserve love like everybody does, then it would be a whole lot easier.  but there's always a part of me that's ready to run, that's waiting for the rock to hit the dam (i love my made up cliches. haha). in fact i'll take that rock usually and throw it at the dam myself and cry, ""see what you did? it could have been perfect"".  I'm a scared little girl. this is why i feel like i will never ve happy for long, with anybody.  but i still hope that maybe someday, it will happen for me.

all those things you've been learning, gathering,  they start to arrange themselves into something cohesive and whole.

i guess that's how I am...i push things too much, just like how people push me too much. I don't let things unfold, I carry the guilt so heavily that i keep back the energy of synchronicity, the natural energy.  And since i mentally carry these burdens,  i am too worn to physically attempt at solving them because i feel like i've already failed. 

for once i would like to not feel guilty for doing what comes naturally to me, and for once i would like the peace of mind and heart to feel okay with myself when i am doing these things, to feel ecstatic even that i am here and i can do these things.

"event","i felt like writing more today. i got inspired.


I am sick of: obsessive control freaks.  ie, my family.  I cannot stand my family, as Michael wrote.  they are all in all entirely responsible for if i should ever go completely insane and have to be locked up.  infact, going insane may be a nice option as then i will only have to see them during visiting hours.  

there are some really hard, underhanded things you have to learn in life.   Like you have to learn about these people you live with, and either you'll believe everything they tell you and do as they say without question,  or question everything they say and follow your own path/s.  Learning about whether or not yout family really is looking out for you or only really looking out for their own goals and feelings is a very very hard thing to sort through. If it weren't for a scant few in my life that understand me, i don't know what I would do.  besides drugs, that is.  a whole lot of drugs and nights spent listening to Dark Side of the Moon. 

it takes a whole lot of energy, effort, spirit, to keep treading water after every new wave that comes over you...retreats,  comes back, again and again.  the same old shit thrown back at you over and over, never having completely left the first time around cause you've got all that seaweed stuck , hung over your ears, down your shirt so by the time you pick all that crap off it comes back again and here we go again.

i am sick of:  waiting around, forever, for something, or someone to make me feel like I am real, and alive. I am despondent over the fact that I even feel like I am not alive right now.  I feel like one of those ghosts that goes around the house, thinking it's still their house, going through the motions of life but only really fooling themselves.  you know....like bruce willis' character in the Sixth Sense.

tentative plans for armsofsleep.org  budding in my sketchbook......little by little i'll hit at what is coming out of me. god, I feel like Radiohead right now. haha  I am really loving this Smashing Pumpkins - The Smiths - Jeff Buckley connection with the domain.   and of course.....it's going to be alot about my real/imagined relationship with Mr B. the layout will be gorgeous.....it will be filled with him and dedicated to him and ..   you know, i realized now how I am exactly what I always wondered about. what a strange strange little moment of truth...

i work again tonite, and then have three days off. and Vanessa time on Thursday...and maybe we'll go feed our kittens that nite.  the birthday is coming up and i'm barely conscious of it.  i told babylamb he'd better call me and save me from another nite of family togetherness. LOL i won't hold my breath but if he did call me i know it would make my day.

apparently, we will be putting the house up for sale in two weeks.   this means i have alot of cleaning to do. this makes it all real. 

the phone is ringing but if she doesn't hear it, i'm not about to answer it.  i couldn't care less than i care now.  which is not at all. unless we can get into the negatives. but then that would be not-caring so much that you actually end up caring because you're obviously thinking about it alot.

I think I'll go have lunch with myself and my sketchbook.  Valentine is coming along nicely.  she's really a cutie, and i love making her.   and now miss Lenore.  at least i think that's the name I'm settling on. they remind me alot of me and Vanessa. <3

exactly a week from now we are gonna see The Receiving End of Sirens and Circa Survive. and it will be FUNNNNN!!  

The head Photo Tech at work  is being really bitchy because she's pregnant (accident) and she's got hormones going all over the place.   she had a hissy fit because i opened a new roll of film (obviously someone didn't put the other roll in the right spot, or i would have used it..) when the old one had two strips left (insert rolling of the eyes). and for others reasons that probably make her think I am trying to take over her position (like i care to. LOL) when i'm only trying to do what she won't do to make the lab more efficient and organized.

well,  enough of this popsicle stand."

i'm glad that everybody is so impressed by that one time she wore a gown, they thought it was so punk rock because it had stripes all over it.  in reality it looks like she layed down on a freshly-painted black bench.  GAWD she is SO COOL.

also, if you live in arizona, go to a show, and take a personal fan with you, you will quickly make alot of friends.   and perhaps even get some proposals.  but i turned them down of course as I've already been promised to the one and only Luke Perry.

we got there at 11:30 am,  waited in line in the heat until 5:30 (thank god for the umbrella and the fans,  i honestly don't know what we would have done without them). then waited some more when we got to the stage, for like another hour.  the worst part was we befriended this funny girl and made a pact that whoever got the the front first would help the other person to the front of the stage, too. but when we got there she wouldn't let us in.  so me and Vanessa were wishing things like, ""I hope she get's hurt!!""  and then....welll.......since karma is a bitch and all, she did get hurt....and had to leave. JUST before HIM came on......LMFAO.  I don't feel guilty one bit!!  

all in all it really wasn't a very good time at all. when i try to think of the highlights of the show, I can honestly not think of much at all.  oh yes,  wait, it was definetely when the girl got kicked in the face and started bleeding but refused to leave,  but it was so nasty cause she was bleeding everywhere so eventually they had to force her out. also when Ville put cigarettes in his hat and he looked like the devil.  but he never came away from the stage, though me and V managed to weasle our ways right up front and center.  I was hoping to get a nice big kiss and I'm sure Vanessa was hopeing for some gropeing action but alas.

and poor Vanessa got sick on two ocassions and had to rush to the bathroom and spew, which scared the shit out of me. and unbeknowest to me she nearly choked >< but luckily some nice lady helped her.  ><

gosh what a gross nite.

I love HIM,  but i sure don't recommend them live.   Get the dvd with the music videos. LOL

I am so angry too.....this boy, i don't know where he is.  i text him every now and then to say hi, but nothing back.  he emailed me back once but not since then.  and he's a huge HIM fan so I was excited to talk with him about out harrowing escapade. he won't answer his phone, and yeah i know he's busy, and I honestly am not being sellfish. it makes me happy that he's busy doing what he should be doing, but.....man, it wouldn't kill him to aknowledge me every once in a blue moon.  men are the fucking bane of my existence.  well, except for corey.  i feel like i could talk with him about anything. and anthonies too, cause I love him.   but pretty much everyone else is a jerk.....well also except for Michael, too.  alright well you get the point.

The blanket is warm
This body will never be safe from harm
Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal
Touch my skin to keep me whole

If only you'd come back to me
If you laid at my side
Wouldn't need no Mojo Pin to keep me satisfied

Don't wanna weep for you, I don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black beauty I love you so
Precious, precious silver and gold and pearls
in oyster's flesh
Drop down we two to serve and pray to love
Born again from the rhythm screaming down from heaven
Ageless, ageless and I'm there in your arms

The welts of your scorn, my love, give me more
Send whips of opinion down my back, give me more
Well it's you I've waited my life to see
It's you I've searched so hard for"

lots of things happening but in the end it doesn't seem like all that much, really O.O

The biggest news is that I've sworn off romantic love for about the past few weeks and I've never felt better!  I decided once and for all that I was wasting way too much time I could be putting twords something worthwhile, like making stuff.  or watching tv, for example. haha  So I am off the market, nun-style. Except I'm not a nun for jesus, more like my own personal muses. ^_^

also, you never really forget about the first person you've ever really loved.  that sort of thing never goes away. and if I can't love that person the way I need to, well, then....I just don't want to love anyone else.

People still seem to feel sorry for me, but it makes me angry cause I don't want anybody's pity, telling me all that stuff like, ""you'll find someone some day, just for you!""  but i know that not everyone has that sort of someone.  I am happy enough to know a few of the best people there are in the world, and I love them dearly....and that's the best kind of love there is. I don't really need anything else.

aside from all of that, i've been getting back into sculpting, which has been scary but exciting at the same time. I know I've got the skills for sure but you know...it's hard to take that first real leap. I keep mincing around the edges....like making prebaked eyes, messing around with cello paper, yadda yadda.  somehow it's hard to just dive in and start making the body. mostly I'm afraid that i'll work so hard and then after I bake it my baby will be all burnt up and crispy.  

Me and the V went and saw Coheed on Tuesday, and it was good but all I can really say about the experience is this ""DEATH TO FALSE EMO"".  I am so looking forward to the HIM show in June <3<3

That song....""you're beautiful, you're beautiful, you're beautiful, it's true. i saw your face in a crowded place and I don't know what to do.  cause I'll never be with you"".  it keeps going over and over in my head.  what a sad song!  that's been my theme for the past 4 years or so.

I like meat. i think it's good.

But tonite, after making myself a steak I couldn't help but feel sickened

When I cooked it, I covered the pan with a paper towel, and found that the whole paper was soaked with blood as it was released from the meat about 10 minutes later. I pretty much screamed like a baby.
As I was eating it, I became very conscious of the fact that I was eating an animal.  I was worried if I had cooked it all the way through, and that brought the image of cow blood back. Then flashes of poor tortured cows ran through my mind. Cows going into one room and shooting out a pipe in the form of t-bones. and the smell of cow shit. and needless to say, my appetite was wiped out. 

I'm not some animal worshipper. I mean, i love animals, they're fun! and sometimes they taste good. but tonite I was just acutely aware of ingesting another creature. 

Not to say I'm gonna suddenly become vegan.  but i think I'm going to be more conscious of what meat i'm eating. I've already ruled out pork, so i'm sure it won't be so hard to minimalize beef. 

I just don't want to eat the cells of animals that were treated miserably. I'm sure that that can only put more misery into my own cells.   karma's a bitch!"

But in my dream she was standing there, in a gown and a white fur around her shoulders and I remember her hugging me close to her, and she was soft and everything was white white white.

"event","Things are a little bit scary lately, around this house.  

It starts in the seams.  My book shelves are a bit emptier.  the garage has been cleaned out, repainted, and looks brand new. my heart is hurting more and more, bit by bit. slow enough that it's hard to notice but real enough that I can feel the hurt when I do. 

it's starting to look more and more like a house that'll be up for sale soon. 

I went to sell my old tv today, and as I was waiting for the other people at the pawn shop to be done, i was standing there with my tv on a cart and started to have serious misgivings. I'd look out at my car sitting in the rain (how appropriate), and think of how this tv's been with me for 10+ years.....how I got it for my birthday...  how I really hated that I was going to sell it to some sleazy pawn shop.  I guess what I hated most of all was that I had to be selling anything at all.

When the guy told me he'd pay me $10 for it I said, ""I'll take it"".  and as he was about to take my tv I clarified, 
""No. I'm taking it home"". Part of me was relieved.

Tonite I'm overcome with this need to cry.  Nothing seems to be working out these past few weeks. I wish everything were completely different. 

The only thing that I feel fairly certain about is that I don't think I care if I never find someone for me.  As time passes, I only feel more that in all likelihood, it probably won't ever happen. It's not so bad, you know. I've learned that alot of the people I admire couldn't find their person either.  I know for sure that some of us just don't have one.

I'm tired of mourning the loss of someone I haven't met.  I'm tired that there are so many losses to mourn lately. 

On a different note:

Sherrie Lea is such a phony it's not even funny.  You'd think she would have bothered to read more marilyn monroe biographies to account for the discrepancies in marilyn's case. The alleged ""proof"" that she is even Marilyn's reincarnation is full of holes, and I can't wait to get my hands on the book coming out soon based on these supposed proofs. GAH.  bogus bogus bogus."

"event","Is it really possible to die of a broken heart.?


I think so.

I think that when things fester inside of us, when they aren't released, they have a huge effect on our health. 

I think that living under negative, black-hole influences can stunt a person physically and emotionally. It can squash a person like a bug.

So if you feel that way...like you're being held down in the water just as you were coming up for air, then leave. Please leave.  get yourself out of it.  Do what your heart keeps telling you to do. Don't ever let anybody tell you any different, or tell you it's stupid, or tell you you'll never be that good. Fuck everybody else."

and me being there will only alleviate it for a little while.
I hope he understands, that I understand why he's doing the things he's doing to himself, to kill the black hole that keeps pulsating bigger and bigger inside of him, taking everything into himself. 

There are so many people that I wish I could save. But I know that in the end I can't. All I can really do is just, love them, as they are. for who they are. and in the end we're all fucked up anyway, so we might as well just make it our own. 

I was watching this movie, Grizzly Man, last nite. About Timothy Treadwell, who had a blonde mop of hair and the naivette of a child, He was living amongst grizzy bears in Alaska, videotaping them, studying them.  He overcame his drug abuse problem, his alchoholism, in order to study these bears. And he seemed so happy to be there with them, his heart just overflowing with joy and love and tenderness, and in the same vein overflowing with that love because he so longed for others to feel that way for him.

In 2003 he and his girlfriend were killed and eaten by one of the bears, one on the verge of starvation.

A man interviewed in the documentary said that Treadwell got what he deserved, that the bears probably thought Treadwell was ""mentally retarted"".

it just blew my mind how...SICK, how cruel, hateful, uncaring so many people are in this world. I started yelling at the man on the tv, near tears, so angry at his heartlessness. I saw it as this perverse form of jealousy....that this person was happy, doing what he loved, living for causes that he believed in passionately...and how many of us can say that?

so at any rate....if you get the chance, please watch this movie. it broke my heart, rebuilt it, and broke it again. Treadwell is one of my new heroes.  the black sheep, the sacrificla lamb."

Working on Dr.Pedja.com, which I've been putting off pretty well.  Tonite I meant to do my assignment for ARS but since the My ASU site wasn't cooperating, I thought I'd take a crack at trying to create the design for Dr.Pedja.com.  I like what I've gotten so far. It's a bit grunge, but has just enough clean lines to suit even a doctor. well we shall seeeeee

Went to an ABBA meeting today, and I talked with Cindy about whether or not my Paranormal Reference Deck would be fine for the ABBA show at the Paper Studio, which it will be :)  The deadline is coming up soon too so I wanted to make sure. This will be the first thing I've had in a real show before. I'm pretty excited ^_^ I'm proud of what I've created.

I got an application for JoAnne crafts store today, so I'll probably turn that in tomorrow, as well as my app for the Wherehouse. I have barely any money left. I really need a job. yeeeeeek

Later today I went to the gym, had fun, got in the sauna and nearly died cause it was so damn hot for some reason tonite.  And then I was excited like a dork afterwards to use the showers. I even took a basketfull of my showering neccesities with me over there to keep in my locker: shampoo, conditioner, body wash, mousse, a pouff for my body wash, face scrub, root booster, etc etc. Of course, only the essentials. hahaha  It felt nice coming home already all nice and clean ^_^

Bellydance Superstars show this Tuesday nite, which I am SO excited for. Plus there's some sort of Medievil Fair that Diane was asked if we would dance for in March, so I'm looking forward to that. 

and, of course, the Armor show.  I am SO excited. we're gonna meet them, Vanessa's gonna rape Anthony, I'm gonna giggle and point at Ben and blush and giggle some more.  HOORAY

I feel so tired, and my head has been aching for the better half of the day. But I feel happy on the inside otherwise. 

My dad is turning into an empty figurehead.  It's funny how clownish bullies look when you take the power away from them. They start scrambling for mean things to say like a fish out of water and all you can do is sort of just watch them flounder."

Last nite, while watching the tail end of a nerve-wracking coyotes game vs the oilers, my dad happened to mention to me, ""oh me and jovi and oli are going to a game on saturday. want to come?""

I want to but I don't. I do because I would love to watch a hockey game live with Oli cause he's so cute!! but I don't because my dad would be there, and my dad has this way of ruining everything. 

what hurts me about it is that, apparently,  they already bought the tickets. without ever having asked me if I wanted to go when they bought them.  and now my brother's saying, ""well, I don't know if there will be any seats available next to us"".

which pretty much tells me, ""you're not invited"". So I was just like an afterthought, eventhough I'm the biggest hockey fan in the family and they know it. 

That would be like ...ok let's say you're obsessed with Prince. and somehow a friend of yours gets tickets to a prince show. and then they ask, ""oh....yeah...um...did you want to go? cause well...I only got these three tickets......."" as you're standing there in your prince t shirt, purple leather jacket, jerry curl, and sad puppy dog eyes.

It's just so immature and petty.! And these people are supposedly grown-ups...

In other news...

I made a new friend today in computers. he makes me giggle ^_^

Me and Vanessa had lunch today, and it was so nice. I missed her so much. I hate not getting to see her. but we get to hang out tomorrow night. yay!!  We also now have a pet blackbird whom we named Douglas ;-)

"event","Cleaning through some things today, I found an old journal of mine, from about 8 years ago. And as I was flipping through it, I was struck by how.....unlike myself I sounded. I kept thinking, ""this isn't me, this is the old me...the person that I was before.""

But then there were some similarities.  For the most part, I was disturbed by it. People usually look back on their old journals/diaries with fondness and sigh in rememberance, but as I started reading mine, I wanted to shake it off like it was a gigantic poisonous hairy spider.

Moreover, I realize how completely ignorant I was.  The hints were there in front of my face all along, and of course hindsight is 20/20. It kind of makes me smile how things are working out. All roads lead to Australia.

Also, I felt bad for that younger version of myself.  I was so embryonic, so hopeful and optomistic.  My family was still decently in function. But during that journal is when it started to fall apart between my dad and I. In it I also confessed how I don't have the best relationship with my mom. and where, before, I felt like sometimes I could turn to my brother for support and guidance, now it feels like he's turned into ""one of them""

Cleaning through my stuff, I also found an old transcription of a public poem by Karen Finley, that one of my instructors, Angela Ellsworth, gave to us in class a few years back. 

I like it alot. It was pivotal to me when we got them.  I put it under a cut to be nice, but I hope you'll read it.

The Black Sheep
(Public Poem by Karen Finley)

After a funeral someone said to me,
You know I only see you at funerals.
it's been 3 since June
been 5 since June for me
He said I've made a vow
I only go to death parties if I know someonebefore they were sick
Why?
cause-cause-cause-I feel I feel so
sad cause I never knew their life
and now I only know their death
and because we are members of the
Black Sheep Family

We are sheep with no shepherd
we are sheep with no straight and narrow
we are sheep with no meadow
we are sheep who take the dangerous
pathway through the mountain range
to get to the other side of our soul
we are the black sheep of the family called the Black Sheep folk
we always speak our mind
    appreciate differences in culture
    believe in sexual preferences
    believe in no racism, no sexism, no religionism
and we'll fight for what we believe
but usually we're pagans
there's always one in every family
even when we're surrounded by bodies
we're always alone -
you're born alone and you die alone
written by a black sheep.
you can't take it with you - 
written by a former black sheep.

Black Sheep folk look different from their family - 
it's the way they look at the world
we're a quirk of nature we're a quirk of fate - 
usually our family, our city, our country
never understand us
we knew this from when we were very young
that we were not meant to be understood.
that's right. that's our job.
usually we're not appreciated until the next generation.
that's our life. that's our story.
usually we're outcasts, outsiders in our own family.
don't worry - get used to it.
my sister says I don't understand you!
but I have hundreds of sisters with me tonight.
my brother says I don't want you!
but I have hundreds of brothers with me here tonight.
my mother says I don't know how to love someone like you!
you're so different from the rest!
but I have hundreds of mamas with me here tonight!
my father says I don't know how to hold you!
but I have hundreds of daddies with me here tonight!

we're related to people we love who can't say
I love you black sheep daughter
I love you black sheep son
I love you outcast, I love you outsider
but tonight we love eachother
that's why we're here
to be around others like ourselves
so it doesn't hurt quite so much
in our world our temple of difference
I am at my loneliest when I have something to celebrate
and try to share it with those I love but
who don't love me back
there's always silence at the end of the phone
there's always silence at the end of the phone

sister - congratulate me!
NO I CAN'T YOU'RE TOO LOUD
GRANDMA LOVE ME
NO I DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU
sometimes the Black Sheep is a soothsayer,
a psychic, a magician of sorts
Black Sheep see the invisible
we know each other's thoughts
we feel fear and hatred

sometimes, some sheep are chosen to be sick
to finally have average, flat, boring
people say I love you
sometimes Black Sheep are chosen to be sick
so families can finally come together
and say I love you
sometimes, some Black Sheep are chosen to die
so loved ones, families, countries and cultures can finally say
your life was worth living
your life meant something to me!
I loved you all along
Black Sheep's destinies are not in
necessarily having families,
having prescribed existences -
like the American Dream
Black Sheep Destinies are to give
meaning in life - to be angels,
to be conscience, to be nightmares
to be actors in dreams

Black Sheep can be family to strangers
we can love eachother like MOTHER
FATHER SISTER BROTHER CHILD
we understand universal love
we understand unconditional love
we feel a unique responsibility for feelings for others
we can be all things to all people - 
we are there at 3:30 AM when you call
we are here tonight cause I just can't go to sleep
I have nowhere else to go
I'm a creature of the night, I travel in your dreams
I feel your nightmares
we are your holding hand
we are your pillow, your receiver, your cuddly toy

I wish I could relieve you of your suffering
I wish I could relieve you of your pain
I wish I could relieve you of your death
Silence at the end of the phone
Silence at the end of the phone
Silence at the end of the phone

Things are a bit wonky but sort of good.?  Lately I feel like I'm going up and down and I was starting to get motion sickness for a while there but for now I feel ok.  I realized that it really DOES help to kick and/or punch something when you're angry at someone. There's a shoeprint on a tire in the garage to prove it. 

I'm working on Dr.Pedja's website, and I might put up a little somethin somethin for corey's band.  Not to mention getting my own sites up, crimenittley.!! 

Also, I may have a job as a kids costumed character for birthday parties. Serious! It was Vanessa's idea. mehehe. The lady's supposed to call me next week to schedule an interview. I am so excited, I hope that I can get it.  $30 an hour sounds pretty good to me. 

There's visiting Michael in march for spring break.  Though both me and Vanessa giggled at the idea of saying ""dude we spent spring break rocking out in Missouri!""  ;-) hehehe.  And I talked with Jasonieasoniefaceoniethirdbase-oni last night and he plans to wine and dine both me and Vanessa when he gets here. LOL. If it ends up in a threesome then it's only what I suspected! 

I'm trying my best to stay positive lately, really. I've been taking Dr. Hubbard's advice and writing down when I have bad , volatile emotions and trying to figure out the triggers for those emotions. I think it's working. At least, I'm much more *aware* of my emotions and how out of control they can get.

The new gym we're going to is funtastic!!!! Yeah I said it.  It's different but in a good way, and it gives me so much energy and makes me feel happy. I was skipping around the house yesterday, I was in such a good mood.  And I love the sauna there. I'm red as a beet after half an hour but it's supposed to help expell toxins from your body through your sweat, and I feel so good after it. yayayayayayayayayayay PLUS it's the perfect time to catch up on all the TomKat BritKev SimpsonLachey gossip columns. hahaha. It's Vanessa's fault I read these now.

I'm also excited cause I'm going to make Adria some coloured drawings that I promised her a long time ago :)  I need to get them enlarged, so tomorrow I'll be able to start.

(geez, I sound like a really happy, annoying person right now.  I'm sorry to those of you who are used to me hating the world and everything in it. LOL. I'll be back to normal before ya know it.)

So, tomorrow:
(1) cleaaaaaaaaaaan
(2) gyyyyyyyyymmmmmm
(3) drawings for adriakins
(4) hockey game
(5) homework
(6) crazy sex with
    a. goats
    b. jason in my dreams
    c. all of the above plus prison sex with Leif Garrett"

HOWEVER:  My mom is being pissy again lately. Im sick of her being such a ^*&%@$$!! I left my oil burner on in my room, and it only uses a small tealight and it goes out after a few hours. and so she goes in my room cause she ""smells something burning"" though of course nothing is burning(except for the oil, which is the whole purpose of the ""oil burner"" after all), she probably just wanted to go in there to be the obnoxious, nosey person that she is. and when I told her the tealight goes out on its own, then she tells me, ""well why don't you even THINK that something could catch on fire??""

Last nite I had a really weird moment of sobbing for various reasons while laying in bed listening to Duncan Sheik.  I wanted to cry out too but other people were sleeping in the house. It was strange but it felt good, cathartic. I like cathartic experiences, apparently.

But then I had this dream........that all men were created equal....
haha alright, I thought I'd throw that in there since it IS martin luther king jr day and all....
let's all tip one back for good ol martin luther, folks!

but seriously, I dreamt that I was flying around and this little creature was telling me what to do next time I feel sad.  LOL I really wish I remembered what it told me though. it might have to repeat it a few times in other dreams before I can recall it, what with my overall bad memory and all.

Tomorrow I finally get to hang out with Vanessa again.  YAY!!

I know the next book I want to make. it's gonna be called Moon in Pisces.  I am really excited for this <3

I know what i want to be when i grow up.  a bellydancing astrologer tarotreader painter kitten-petter.

I mean, I think I understand that my dad cares about me, but I still need to come to terms with the fact that he can't love me the way I feel I deserve to be loved.

And I have ALOT of regrets with what happened. I always feel like I'm on edge now. 

Inspite of it all, I feel pretty good, because I have people I can count on, that I can trust, who love me and who I love.

Having a therapist will be good for me I think.  It's good to have someone listen to you, someone who's unbiased and who will let you speak and express how you feel without wanting to censor you or tell you you're not allowed to feel that way. It'd be even better if he weren't so expensive but we can't have everything ^_^

I think I need only 6 more classes before I graduate.  So I will try to take 3 this semester, and take one or two in the summer, and then 2 or 1 in the winter. this is great news because I'll be able to work without feeling completely overwhelmed, and I will have time to make things and set up my portfolio for graduate school applications.

Armor For Sleep is coming, February 14th. I'm sooo excited. me and Vaness feel like we know them. She's gonna put the moves on Anthony hardcore. XD Also, February 7th, the Bellydance Superstars are coming.  I couldn't be more excited.  February is gonna kick ass this year! It's about time, cause it usually sucks :-o

Also, I think I'm in love. I'm pretty sure that I am. I trust him. when I'm sad he makes me laugh...I love his voice and obsession with Ville Vallo and lazy ways. And he's asked me to be his valentine.  I've never had a real valentine before.  Vanessa's prediction was right :) yup yup.

When I told him how I felt like I've been  waiting and waiting, and ""where IS he?"" he said ""I'm here!""

I got the answer I've been looking for afterall, it seems.

And there's this strange working going on inside of me...like preparation. I don't know how else to describe it really.

Things work when they're supposed to. you can't force them.  You can try to nudge them along, but sometimes they all just come together in one big fell swoop, faster and more strange than you can ever imagine.

One thing I know for sure is that my determination is much more solemn and honest now.

I have my doubts. it's not to say that I'm not still really scared, cautious. but this time I am keeping only a half step away instead of my usual 5 feet. haha


enough of that stuff!!

I hope everyone had a really good Christmas :)!

I had this crazy dream last nite that I was in this shopping area and there was an entire store dedicated to Troll dolls. But I woke up before I got to go in. and I remember as I was starting to wake up and moving away from the dream that I thought to myself, ""oh nuts!! I wanted to go in there!"".  LOLOL.

I'm really sick of people talking about how bellydance was always meant to be sexy and entice men and whatnot. Honestly, that's not true. And there is a HUGE difference between sexy and just plain trashy. But I'm not gonna say that because then everyone will yell at me because the vast majority of them already hate me. well they can just suck it!!!"

Me and Diane were the only ones there for the 7-8 class, so she went over undulations with me.  and now I understand ALOT better how to do them corectly. and I also understand camel walks. I was having the HARDEST time.  I am so excited to practice :)!  

But then at 8 Krystle and her mom came, so it was only us there still. We went over the drum solo routine and at least now I know the way it's supposed to look. LOL. It's a pretty short song but it's really jumpy and you gotta do the moves fast or you miss out.

It was funny because Diane was talking about how she thought Krystle was much older than her actual age (I think she's actually 17-18) because she looks like this mature woman of the world, and she said she thought I was like 12.   LOL and she came to me and started pinching my cheeks and saying ""look at this cute little babyface!!!!""   hahahaha.

I got a call from Chris, which was groovetacular. we talked for a while catching up yo.  I now have a strange fascination with whale call mix CD's. Hahaha

well I talked to Mr boy again last nite. I think we've talked maybe 4 days in a row now.?  Well I'm supposed to call him again in a ""couple days"" as I so stupidly suggested. Look at me, all trying to play it cool. LOL. I'm so bad at it!!! Man. I am going through withdrawls.  and this is only the first nite.  My dialing finger is itching something awful.

the first nite is always the worst, though. I'm sure when it's tomorrow, it won't feel so bad.  I just miss his voice so much. and when he meows at me. and the way he says, ""I know"" so cute with his cute little cute accent. and when he laughed at how I told him his kitten name is Simon McBooties. heeheehee oh man.

I mean, I like the people there and all but....I just get so scared in those types of social situations. I have alot of paranoia in me so it's just really hard to be around alot of people. 

It was also a little weird because one of the guys of the family hosting the party is a guy that my family thinks should be my husband (haha). So shit it's like, he's really funny and sweet but when I'm around him I feel like everyone's thinking, ""OH MY GAWD jelena's putting the moves on him!"" so it just makes me feel awkward and blah. I end up almost ignoring the guy and looking like a cold bitch. it doesn't help when your brother comes up to you and says, ""he's looking good tonite, huh?"". 

So yeah just being anywhere near him makes m    e think that he's thinking I'm trying to hit on him or something.  It's frustrating. I'm not even attracted to the guy ><

My family has no idea.  Too bad my brother's married, otherwise I'd tell him to go for it. hehehe

So afterwards when we got home I watched the Sixth Sense, which is probably one of my favourite movies. Well I was watching some of the bonus material, an interview with M Night dude.  He talked about how the movie opened on his birthday, which made him feel like there really were forces backing up the movie.  and when he said his birthdate, my jaw dropped and I had to rewind and listen to it again a few times.   My birthday. 

Sure we all share our birthdays with like 9 million other people.  But it just seems funny to me that here is this guy, who made a movie about something that fascinates and haunts me, with my birthday. 

Too bad I really didn't like The Village.  LOL. 

Well, so far he's not here yet.  So. I'll give him another half hour and then I'm just gonna go to bed. 

He told me some stuff, about dreams he has.  Dreams that scare him. Premonition dreams. I had a feeling that something was there.  But now maybe I scared him off.  I see a pattern with me being some sort of weird spiritual catalyst or something. Hooray for me ><"

Plus I have to go to a serbian thing tonite and I'd rather stay at home because I hate being in those uncomfortable serbian social situations. Basically I don't really like any of the people and it's boring as hell. I have to be fake to most of them and pretend that I like being there and it gets so tiring after a few hours. I'd take my DS with me if I was sure that it wouldn't insult people. lol. 

I think I should do well not living at home because living at home makes me hate people alot more than I probably should. Haha

I can't wait to run away, it's gonna be great!!!!!

The cards aren't gonna get there in time for christmas so just deal with it >:D

At any rate, I was up late again thanks to mr lover, and then I couldn't sleep eventhough I was exhausted, because I kept thinking of him and the things he said to me. I hate being such a goon about it all.  I started doing that thing where I began to doubt him and how he feels for me, and that made me depressed as all hell, and listening to Patience by Guns N Roses didn't help. And then I started thinking again that maybe it's true that noone will ever understand my heart, so maybe looking for love really is just a search in vain for me. But then I realized it was seriously all in my head. And that all probably happened within the span of one hour. haha. 

I wonder what it would feel like to just have faith in yourself. To not second guess your actions or thoughts or feelings. I'm assuming it would prolly be pretty nice!

I know each time there is someone new in my life, I feel on top of the world.  It's the way I am....I let other people make me feel real and alive. With him, I don't want to bring in expectations, I don't want to kill this innocent, shy-feeling, unsure love. 

I'm pretty sure that he feels just as strongly about me.  We're both impatiently excited.  He told me he may have to come here sooner and kidnap me, and my only request was that he let me know in advance so I can get the uhaul's-worth of my crap ready to go. haha. 

Well yesterday's meeting with Angela went really well.  We talked for about 2 hours, about my projects.  I think she was really pleased with what I had. and that made me happy because it validates my own pride in my accomplishments. 

It's a funny thing, inspiration, vs what I call outspiration.  Inspiration being what comes to you ""out of the blue"". But Angela's right....you can't always wait for inspiration. sometimes inspiration has other plans.  Sometimes you have to just bite the bullet and grind away and sometimes it feels like hell, like what giving birth must feel like in a sense......like it's coming drop by drop, bit by bit, like you're working your ass off and it feels like nothing is coming. This is outspiration, I decided.  It's something you have to work through.  So artistic blocks aren't really blocks after all.  You bring them upon yourself.  You can't always have genius works , sometimes you have to wrestle your ideas to the ground, smack them around a few times, and hold them down until you can capture what it is that you need from them.

So let's declare an end to the artistic block.  If you keep on doing what you're doing, things will come to you.  if you build it, he will come. etc etc.

Vanessa made me buy this cd, the Super Furry Animals. And so far I am digging it oh yes. 

Oh last nite I watched the original Hitchcock version of Psycho.  It was SO good, so well done.  It makes me angry that people decide to do remakes of movies that were already so good to begin with.  It only proves that most people are idiots and can ruin good things.  Or I guess it's kinda sweet to want to remake films as a tribute, but still, it's like.....make a mural or something if you want to honour a person, jesus christ. don't take their amazing work and reinvent it as crap.  I do not think Hitchcock would like that very much. haha"

b) writing a paper on it
c) studying for my final at the crack of dawn tomorrow.

I have this feeling that I'll do decently and actually pass the class.  well. I hope I will, anyway. Haha Maybe it's just wishful thinking!

How funny that he should talk to me on the day I finally deleted his phone number from my address book. It's not like...I mean..I do miss some aspects of him but it's not like I'm crying over it. I just felt bad that he seemed to just stop caring entirely. Maybe it was his way of coping , by ignoring me and my feelings. but it's like, I deserve better than that. I was there for you and cheering you on, and I wouldn't do that to you, just drop you like a hot potato.

I feel better now though. eventhough talking with him pulls up old memories that make me feel a bit sad and nostalgic.  overall it feels good because it finally feels like an ending. 

well you really can't depend on anyone.  even the people you think will be the most by your side will sometimes be the first ones to just drop you, not care.  that's why having Vanessa is so important to me. she understands me more than my family can, and more than I think anyone ever can or will try to. It makes you really afraid to open your heart to anybody, so maybe it's best to keep your heart to yourself.

I'm not a bad person. but it's like, when I extend myself to others a little bit, when I try to share with them what hurts me inside, what makes me tick, it's like they just shrink away..like they don't want to hear it, like they don't care to, because I'm just there for them to feel better about themselves.

You know, at least in the end he was honest with me.  and that's more than I can say for alot of people.

I don't think it's so bad to walk it alone anymore. Maybe Vanessa is right, about some people not having somebody of their own. It's hard to stomach because i've always had hope that things would turn out right in the end. But maybe , once again, it's wishful thinking. and it keeps happening this way so much that I'd probably do best to take a hint.

this image is ""Psychic Attack"", which is also known as psychic vampirism.  Basically it's when others try to attack you through your mind.  I've felt this way before, which ends up leaving me completely ""drained"" and exhausted.  Mostly it involves large overwhelming crowds of people.

this image refers to the ""Akashic Records"", which is the universal memory of every occurance there has ever been and ever will be.  This is a part of Theosophy, a spiritualist religion developed by Madame Blavatsky (who is one of my heroes right now) back in the olden times. Anyhow, apparently we are able to access the Akashic Records when we're on the ""other side"" to learn a great deal about anything we could possibly want to learn about and know.

And that doesn't even go to mention the books I have due tuesday as well, which, also, have not been worked on pretty much at all.

But. I'm nearly done with these freakin cards.  I have only 8 more drawings to do...which means I've finished 22 of them.  which is amazing.  

I feel yucky though cause I've been in the house all day.  I'm serious. Not even a drop of sunshine on me. I feek like one of those crazy murderers who is scared of going out into public or something.

shit I'm not making any sense right now. ....

there is one piece of good news however, .....my paper isn't actually due on tuesday. it's thursday.  so that buys me a bit more time. thank god. BUT my final is on thursday, which sucks assssssssssss. 

Oh well. suck it up eka and soon the semester will be over and I will scream for joy!!"

My intermedia independat study is what I'm really excited about, though.

Here are examples of the character designs I'm working on for my book for that. Her name is Lark.

I am sick.

My throat burns like the flaming pits of hell.

and I gave up on my book reports. well I tried to read that book, but I just feel so crummy that it's hard to focus on anything but the fact that I am getting sick.  :(

BUT  I did do something productive. I being the internet nerd that I am, have found a few long lost buddies through the wonder that is myspace.

Including: Donny!!

AND: me and Donny are gonna hang out tomorrow night, first time in like 8 years.  Isn't that nuts???

then I got to thinking, and i thought, you know..what if someone needed to cotnact me SO DESPERATELY and they tried to find me on myspace but they couldn't.??? and then I thought of actually setting up my account abit and then I decided naaaaaahh I'm too lazy to keep up with that shit.  haha.

Oh well, I found Donny so I'm happy. I need nothing more of myspace.

So then I felt so happy, despite all of the crappy school stuff.....that I am making a list of the things I want to do.

I want to.....meet corey and sean and chris and adria. I want to give sean a cuddle intervention. and get high/stoned/wasted with corey and end up talking about auras and animal guides and probably the animaniacs. and then i wanna make out with adria, but if we can't then I wanna at least do some drawings with her ^_^;  and then I wanna go to london and germany and scotland....and hang out with my favourite cousin, and then meet christophe-bot and have a jolly good time with him, british style...and then meet Paul and become a WOMAN. Hahaha.  I'm only partially kidding. and then I want to move and after I move I'm going to move in with Jason in his house and get 5 cats and a white baby grand piano and a bust of marilyn monroe and one of those leg lamps like in Christmas Story. And then I want to open rubylove...and I just want to be happy!  but I also have to take the first step.  and I am so scared to take

that first step.

I know I have to do it.  there are things that are in me that can't come out, because I inhibit them... and I know why I inhibit them. and I don't want to do that anymore. I want to finally be able to be me."

"event","OK so i've been wondering something.

Can you ever really trust someone who's  beautiful?

Cause well, I've fallen for someone who is ...well good looking in a more obvious way.  physically, and plus he's a musician, and he's one of those ""bad boys"" and stuff.... so now I feel like....shit...I have to be this really cool, really ""on"" person when I am with him otherwise I will get eaten alive by all of his other girl ""friends"" that probably secretly want to get into his pants.  

And you know, I'm a really tender person, and my feelings get crushed easily.  So I'm just really scared of what I'm getting myself into here.

I feel like maybe he's telling me what I want to hear because he's a charmer. 

I hope he's being honest, though. 

But for now I'm going to cool it a bit until I can get to know him better. 


Grrr  it's so fucking cold, I'm talking THO here, big time. hahaha."

and It's so hard to trust boys anymore. or anyone for that matter, I guess.  but mostly boys. 

and:  I miss painting.

and: I am so fucked.  

and: I dreamt of London, and seeing those grey skies and little cars made me so happy."

If I had flag-bearers they would be waving my flags on high, and if I had like a whole marching band they'd be playing their instruments and marching and looking mighty dashing in their little striped uniforms. And they'd also name a kid after me and give me the key to the city if they actually did.  so....

yeah oh the reason why is because I finished my box.  woooohoooooooooo  now I have to fill it up with the things I want to put inside.  Oh crap. I'm through with the clay experimenting for now though, that's for sure. I feel like a fucking Italian grandma who has Kneader's Knuckles she's gotta rub with icy hot every day. And the pasta sure as hell isn't getting any damn where near being al dente.  Curse you,  Barillo!

Though I could go on and on with Italian jokes make in entirely poor taste, I have not the energy.  So eka=sleeps=dreams of Jason (the good one not the scary one. the good one!)=has 50million orgasms= attracts alien fertilization experts=gets impregnanted with alien seed!!!= i am out of my fucking mind."

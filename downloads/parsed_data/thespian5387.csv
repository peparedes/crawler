I wonder what my parents will say when I tell them that we're ""trying dating"" lol. I'm just glad that Rob wants to come home with me. I've honestly never been with someone who wants to get to know me and my family and stuff. This makes me think that this really is going to work out. Not that I really had any doubts but still... you know what I mean. I'm really rather excited to show him my dull little town. ""Poor provincial town... Good Morning Belle"" sorry random musical moment. ANyway. We'll see how this weekend goes. :-D I""m all smiles."

I don't know how I'm going to make it through if he's in the Marines. I'll end up going crazy. I know I will. I don't like the idea of him going into the armed forces. I don't like it at all. but I have no say in the matter, he wouldn't even let me talk about it. Well, we did talk about it for a while, but after fighting, screaming, and crying, he told me that we couldn't talk about it anymore. Which really hurt me. He's not the only person this is going to affect. This just doesn't feel right to me, I don't like it at all. Not one bit."

I just want it to be somewhat over, but at the same time I don't want it to be. I'm having so much fun with the cast but at the same time it's a really stressful show. I'm just glad that Rob's in it with me, if he wasn't I don't know what I'd do, I'd for sure be going crazy. I'm not sure how much I want to work at Domino's anymore, I'm tired of always doing all the work. It's really getting old now. I know there isn't anything I can do, but oh well. I guess I'll go.

We open on Friday and I'm about ready to die from too much ""Gagtime"" as one song says. Thank you to Forbidden Broadway for that wonderful joke. Anyway, things are going alright in my life, the stress that is being put on my by myself, others and Ragtime is tripping me out and causing my relationships to get tested. I feel terrible because I'm always snapping on Rob, but it's ok cuz he knows I'm stressed and actually so is he. I just can't wait for this show to be over so that we can have our normal lives back. I'm honestly sick of having my entire night be taken up by this stupid show. Plus it's way too stressful of a show having a costume change almost every song. That's really not cool. Oh well, at least I'm in a lot of scenes. Not much else has been happening in my life, other than I told my step-mom about me. That's an interesting story that I don't even want to get into. So right now I'm sitting here waiting for my two o'clock class to come so I can get that over with and see my Rob. I should probably be working on my schedule for next year as a Music Buisness major but I don't feel like it. I'll work on it tomorrow when I get the chance. Well kids I guess I'll go, do something."

I had a shitload of fun while I was on that tour. I don't know if I've had that much fun on a bus since Florida my Sophmore year. LOL. Although toward the end the ""Grey Zone"" got really annoying. They wouldn't shut up! Oh well. Nothing I could have done about it anyway. Now all I have to do is remember some of the fun quotes so that I can put them in my profile.

The ride there wasn't too bad, but I was kinda bored. I didn't want to pull out a book or anything cuz I thought that'd be rude. Anyway, I got there and made it to CSC JUST in time to set my stuff down and have Mary walk me over to the PAC. (Performing Arts Center) I watched the show, Shelley was AWESOME! I was SO proud of her, she looked so pretty. I didn't get the language but... eh, the lighting schemes were pretty... :-) After the show I gave Shelley the biggest hug anyone has EVER gotten. I missed her so much. I met a bunch of people on my way back to her dorm and then we went down to the CP and had some fries and got ready for Tony to take us to the DU house. The DU house was interesting, but I had fun. I talked to Tony for a while and then went back to SHelley's room where we talked and watched part of Life As A House, it's a good movie from what I saw. I wasnt' really too into it, I was kinda tired, and was talking to Shelley. Then the next day we went to Primo's and then to the PAC to play on the piano for a while and then I had to leave. It wasn't a long weekend but I had a lot of fun. :) Then I got home and the shit hit the fan. I had to do a history of music education timeline and my printer would not work for anything. SO I ended up having to work on it for about 12 hours just to get it done. I was not happy, I ended up wasting a lot of my Sunday. But that's okay. And then yesterday was just a normal day.

Julie was decappated, the aunt died and Whitney is now in a coma. Phillip had a crush on Julie. They were only 15 or so... I can't believe this happend. I feel so bad.

I had a lot of fun. So we decide to walk into Mills to clean up a bit and stuff and what do I see but a large group of people standing in the middle of the hallway on Mills 3. It was a floor meeting. That's right kiddies, I missed the floor meeting about our showers, (people have been leaving shit in them like soap boxes, clothes, and soap on the floor, RA's were getting annoyed) My friend and I walked up to the RA's and asked what the meeting was about. I will never forget the looks on their faces. It was priceless. As I said in my away message... ""Tuition=$12000, Room and Board=$4000, mud fights, rain, and an RA's menicing glare... priceless!!! Welcome to the Millibubble!!!"" It was fun times. Made me very happy. Well I took a shower, felt really good to get all of the caked on mud off. I just thought I'd let you all know how much I enjoyed it. :) *Thespian*"

""Somebody hold me too close. Somebody hurt me too deep. Somebody sit in my chair and ruin my sleep and make me aware of being alive. Being alive. Somebody need me too much. Somebody know me too well. Somebody pull me up short, and put me through hell, and give me support for being alive. Make me alive. Make me alive. Make  me confused. Mock me with praise. Let me be used there in my day. All alone is alone, not alive. Somebody crowd me with love. Somebody force me to care. Somebody let me come through I'll always be there, as frightened as you, to help us survive. Being alive. Being alive. Being alive."" 
That song sums up how I feel to a ""T"". I want someone to make me feel alive. I wonder when I'll find that.

Then on the bus ride home we started talking about ghosts and stuff. I dunno why, but it was cool cuz I guess that Millikin University is like THE most haunted college campus in the US. COOL HUH?

So I think they were happy about that one. :) Then I went to Dana's house and we watched the Green Mile, an EXCELLENT movie! I cried. *blush* Anyway, then we went to Ricks and played poker. Oh yeah and I went home for a little while to have cake with my family and my older brother announced that him and his wife are going to have a baby!

<h3>A GOLD Dragon Lies Beneath!</h3>
</a>
I took the <a href=""http://www.geocities.com/teo592/quiz/dragon.html"" target=""new"">Inner Dragon online quiz</a> and found out I am a Gold Dragon on the inside. My Inner Dragon is the most honorable of all. Golds are the third rarest of all the dragons (after Platinum and Chromatic dragons) and have a station in society that reflects their rarity. I am what one might call a Draconic Knight. Golds live by a strict code of chivalry and commitment. Remember Draco? Yep, Gold Dragon. My appearance is fearsome and all-mighty but I'd never stoop so low as to bring any harm to a human. I'm one of only two dragon types that are aligned ""Lawful Good"" and demonstrate great magical proficiency. My piety, beauty, wisdom, and inner strengrth are absolutely without parallel.<br><br>

Of course, being a Gold  Dragon isn't all high ethics and codes. I like to fly around scaring things, advise humans in their affairs, and shapeshift. Strike that, I <b>LOVE</b> to shapeshift. And I'm great at it. In fact, who's to say I'm not really a Gold Dragon after all? My favorable attributes are honor, truth, kindness, gold, wisdom, bravery, and trustworthiness. If anyone threatens or tries to kill me, I could strike back with my breath weapon - Fire. But then, no one's tried anything that stupid in the last couple thousand years. After all, I'm about 54 feet long.<br><br>"

What is it with me and these early days lately? I'm getting somewhat tired of it. Anyway, I get up do my stuff and get ready to go to Macomb with Shelley. Yes, we did it. We made the three hour drive to Macomb, it was a nice drive, boring, but nice. I mean after you see one corn or bean field you've seen them all. But what can I say, we saw them all. Anyway, we get into town and stop at the Osco where Shelley's cousin Bridget works. We waited 45 minutes until she got off of work and then went to her house to freshen up and change clothes. Then we went to this little Italian resturant and ate. Very good food, if I do say so myself. After that we went to the show. Oh, my, goodness! The show was amazing! I couldn't have asked for a better performance. I had so much fun and the actors were amazing. And this was a little summer theatre workshop. This wasn't even professionals or anything. Well anyway, there were these two kids in front of us who were really nice and cool and they invited us to go to DQ with them after the show. Shelley and I agreed and followed them there. We had a lot of fun just talking and stuff. These kids were cool. Then we went ""home"" and hung out there for a while. Mike, Bridget's boyfriend, was home between jobs and talked with us for a while. He's really nice, and he's kinda cute too. Anyway, we went to bed, got up today and then I drove the three hour drive home. It wasn't an elaborate weekend but it was the best fun I've had in a long time. Thank's Shelley!

We went to church tonight and that was cool, but the highlight of my day was my trip to Chicago. My day started at 6:30 WAY too early for the middle/end of summer. Anyway, so I got gas in my car and then picked up my friend Shelley. Then we found out that the other person going on this trip, Brandon, had to work at 5 instead of 7 like we origionally thought. But it all worked out fine in the end. So we drive up to the train station and make our way onto the train. We get up to Chicago and we've got like two hours until Benihana's opens so we walk around looking for it. Now I thought that it was on State street so we're walking down State Street and it's not there, and it's not there, so we go and ask someone for directions, turns out it's on Superior. Whoops... my bad. But we get there and make a reservation. Walk around a while longer and go back to eat. OH MY GOODNESS! That place is awesome! The food is amazing and the stuff they can do, the chefs, I mean. It's so cool. I totally think everyone should go there at least once! But then we went and walked around Chicago for a little longer and then came home, so it wasn't that much that we did but it was so much fun to hang out with my best friend and Brandon.

"event","Hello again my loves, it is I, Thespian, here to entertain and pour my heart out to you. Let me tell you about my evening. I saw one of the best movies tonight. It ranks up there with <i>Talented Mr. Ripley</i> and <i>Vanilla Sky</i>. Tonight I saw <i>Minority Report</i>. I fully endorse this movie. While at times the plot moved slowly, the times when the action was quick completely made up for it. As I said before, I fully endorse this movie. The concept of the movie brings questions to my mind. What would the world be like if that were true? If there was a way for people to stop murders? Would it be fool proof? Would it be fail-safe? It's interesting to me. To think that someone could see the future and then go and change it before it happens. There are several books and movies on this subject. And multiple Star Trek episodes on it. Yes I am a Star Trek fan. (those of you who continue to snicker will be escorted out of here) Moving on, the concept of precognition and prevention of the future intreages me. I just noticed that I use the word intreage very often. I'll have to find a new word here soon. Something else I found cool about the movie was the computer systems that they had. I totally suggest going to see that movie just for the computer systems. Okay, not really. That would be a waste of six dollars, well not a waste cuz the movie IS excelent. But... you know what I'm trying to say. I digress again. I completely enjoy being a teenager right now, this time period isn't terribly bad. Yes I do know that there are more risks out there than when our parents were our age, but still we have many more opertunities than they do. (yes I know I spelled that wrong, I don't spell very well) I don't know what got me to think about that, but I just did. I mean I'm happy to be an eighteen year old in 2002. I wouldn't have it any other way. This week has seemingly flown by. I know that it's only Tuesday, but it seems like only yesterday was Saturday. The end of my summer as a high school student quickly approaches. I'm not quite sure how to deal with this. In many ways I am grateful that I am going to be leaving here, more opportunities for me to grow, and yet I am reluctant to leave my friends and all of the comfort and memories that I have here. This is strange, Enya's <i>pilgrim</i> began to play. Here's the lyrics, thought they fit:

<i>Pilgrim, how you journey on the road you chose to find out where the winds die and where the stories go. All days come from one day that must you must know, you cannot change what's over but only where you go. One way leads to diamonds, one way leads to gold, another leads you only to everything you're told. In your heart you wonder which of these is true; the road that leads to nowhere, the road that leads to you.  Will you find the answer in all you say and do? Will you find the answer in you? Each heart is a pilgrim, each one wants to know the reason why the winds die and where the stories go. Pilgrim, in your journey you may travel far, for pilgrim it's a long way to find out who you are... Pilgrim it's a long way to find out who you are... Pilgrim it's a long way to find out who you are...</i> 

Fitting isn't it? As I begin on this journey to college, I will begin to find out who I am, and yes it IS a long journey. But I am willing to travel it. Will you continue to travel it with me as my friends, my family, or will you leave me to journey on this path alone? It's your choice. *Thespian*"

What <i>am</i> I digressing from? *Sigh* Today is going to be a strange day, I can already feel it. I semi-watched a good movie today, I'll have to sit down and actually watch it sometime. It was called ""White Squall"" I'm not quite sure when it was made or anything I just know it's about a bunch of guys who are on a boat, like students or something. Like I said I didn't really watch much of it. For some reason, I feel a creative energy in my viens but I have no outlet for it. I can't write for crap, and I have nothing to write about, no inspiration. I can't dance, there isn't enough room in my house. I don't want to play the piano, that just isn't cutting it for me anymore, and singing isn't either. I'd draw, but I want something that I could actually show other people and my drawings seem to resemble those inkblot tests, no one really knows what they are. I'll be right back, my mouth is starting to dry out. I need to get some lemonade or water. (pause) Alright I'm back, the lemonade that my mom made isn't that bad today. She used to make it very watery and it annoyed me, but today's batch actually has a little bit of flavor. When consulting the calendar in my bed room I have found that there are only 36 days until I leave to go to Millikin University and only 6 days until my eighteenth birthday. These two facts make me extreamly happy! I shall be back, I have to do my extreamly happy dance. Alright I'm back. I did my extreamly happy dance and I feel better now. I'm so happy that I'll be going to college, it will give me chance to break free of the hard, constricting cacoon that my parents have encased me in, to spread my colorful wings and begin to fly as an individual. <i>And when you've made your secret journey, you will be a holy man.</i> Those are the words that are playing in my ear right now. Not sure how I feel about them. <i>When I wake up, I know I'm gunna be, I'm gunna be the make who wakes up next to you</i> Now this song, is just fun. :) Because <i>I would walk 500 miles and then 500 more just to be the man who walked 1000 miles just to fall down at your door.</i> I wonder how many people actually feel that way, do it (in a figurative sense) and the realize that the trip was worth more than the destination? Has that ever happened to you? Where the time you took to travel somewhere ment more to you than the place you went? Friday I go and see Jekyll and Hyde. I'm very excited, it proves to be a wonderful show. For some reason the darkness and macabre sense of the show intreages and pulls me in. The idea of man being both evil and good, and two people living in one body, one evil and one good intreages me. I wonder if it might be true. <i>only the good die young</i> yet another strange line. Not sure how I feel about that one either. LOL. I guess I'm not sure how I feel about a lot of things lately. I'm exctied for tomorrow also, tomorrow proves to be a fun day. Going to Chicago to Benihana's for Japanese food. Never had it, so I'm not sure if I'm going to like it or not, but I'm willing to try it. Well, I think I'm off to do something, not sure what though. Perhaps I will play on the piano, or I'll just sit here, wasting my time until I go to my eye dr. appointment. Not sure which. In any case, this journal entry is finished. *Thespian*"

"event","Hello my loves. I'm back, for a while. I felt the need to ramble and I knew this was the place to go. I'm feeling rather intelligent tonight and I'm not sure why. I don't usually feel that way, well that is because I'm usually not. Anyway, I digress, as usual. I actually finally had a somewhat intelligent conversation with someone. Thank you very much Julia for listening to me for such a long time and actually makeing me feel like I'm somewhat smart. You are a sweetheart. Anyway, I was sitting in Barnes and Nobles the other day and I was wandering around and decided to go to the language section. I've never been any good at languages but for some reason I want to learn a strange language that not many people around here speak. And myself being of a slight irish heratige, (and besides, French, German, and Polish don't appeal to me) I decided to pick up a Gaelic book. I didn't realize how difficult it would be to learn. But I really want to learn it. Oh well, maybe sometime in the future. Hopefully. Why is it that people are so hung up on stereotypes? (Yes I know I already talked about this Julia but I want to talk about it more) I find it completely and utterly annoying! I'm sorry, yes I am a gay male who dances and loves musical theatre, but that's about where the stereotype stops. I'm not obsessed with sex. I'm not THAT big of a drama queen. (I can hear some of you snickering, shut up!) I don't consider myself flaming. (again I say to you snickering fools, shut up!) why is it that everyone places a certain person in a stereotype? I'm sorry, not all male dancers are gay, not all gay men are dancers. Not all lesbians are butch, not all butch women are lesbians. Not all gothic people wear black, not all people who wear black are gothic. Not all Irish people are drunks. Not all priests are gay, child molestors, or drunks. I KNOW that people can see this, and if people can see this and KNOW that people are not stereotypical, WHY do they continue to stereotype people? That annoys me. I'm rather upset, if you couldn't tell. Sorry, I'll step off of my soap box now. *takes a step down* anyway. I got a new medalian the other day. It's of St. Genesius, he's the patron saint of the theatre and actors, my old drama teacher would let a student wear one for each act of the play or musical at my high school and I wanted to have one of my own. So my friend Shelley bought me, our friend Joy, and herself one. That way the three of us each have one to remember high school and eachother by. I think it's cool. But I miss wearing my Celtic cross, so I'll probably start wearing both of them and putting one of them inside my shirt. I just realized it's less than a week till my 18th birthday. I'm very excited for it. Shelley is taking me to get my cartalige peirced. I'm a little nervous about it, but it should go fine. I'm wondering when I should tell my parents I'm doing it. I can' just do it and not tell them, that's not fair. I should at least warn them. I'm thinking of saying something to the effect of: ""Mom. Dad. I'm almost eighteen years old, I'll be going off to college in a little less than a month. And seeing as you won't have to look at it for very long, I've decided to get my ear pierced. Now, I know that you don't agree with it and don't like it very much, but it is my body and you would like it if I could make my own decisions. And I agree, I should be able to make my own decisions and live with my own mistakes. If I after I get it, I don't like how it looks or something, I can always take it out and let the hole clothes, and if you wish I will take it out for church."" Does that sound reasonable? I think it is, I mean I'm telling them that I'm doing it, but in a nice way, and I'm even saying that I'll take it out for church. You know? I don't think that it's that bad of a thing, I mean two of my cousins have ear peircings. Oh well. Wow! It's really late and I've written a lot tonight. I think I'm going to bed since it IS three o' clock in the morning. G'night all. Sorry I stopped so abruptly. *Thespian*"

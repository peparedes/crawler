So, yes, it has been a long time.  Almost a year. Oops, my bad. And what has been happening with me? Well, I spent six months in Austria as an exchange student. Then I came home, had a party, was home for a week, went to camp for two weeks, and now I am back home, being anti-social.

I really want a sandwich. Maybe I will write more later. Since, um, I don't seem to really have a life or anything."

Today was pretty good. The school day went fast. First period was interesting because we judged the mandolas or whatever. But, second period... I'm starting not to like because of the teacher. I'll just call her Ms. Cisco--anyway, she like, is starting to get really annoying. She thinks I disrupt the class because I say things like... well, hold on, lemme give you an example:

Ms. C: Let's spring into World War II
Me: SPRING!

After I said that one day, she gave me a mini-lecture about how I distract the class. It's not only me, she says, but I'm part of it. I'm like... grrr. And today, she really had low patience. I understand that we're at school to learn and sometimes our class gets a little carried away, but she was a little... over doing it. Crystal, who sits next to me, was all like, ""she hurt my feelings,"" and even though Crystal was joking a little bit, she wasn't. Like... grr.

Third period, my pride got in my way. I thought that I knew what was going on, so I was working on my Tom Gribalski fan fiction (heh heh) and the teacher said I wasn't supposed to be doing that. I said, ""I know what's going on. When we learn something new, I'll stop writing."" So he asks me to do the problem on the board, and I do it but wrong. BOOYAH, I got moded. And I learned a lesson: PRIDE = STUPID. For the remainder of the period, I paid attention.

I forgot my books for French and I was all scared that Mlle was going to deduct points from me, but she didn't deduct too many, I don't think. I went to my locker right before that class, so I don't know what they hey I was thinking (to forget my books!) I'm such a space cadet--seriously. I always forget what or why I'm doing something... at least in school.

It's homecoming time and lunch was the Junior march. I didn't march. I wanted to stay and go to the club meeting, but Aud wanted to watch the march, so we did. We have been splitting lunch lately (she gives me half her sandwich and I give her half my gatorade), so once the march reached us, like, it was funny. I went out and began yelling and eating my sandwich. I would've stayed, but then I think some people started dropping confetti or something, and the sandwich comes first, so bye bye!

At the meeting, Shawn gave me a bite of one of his two sandwiches. Yum!

Then, in science, we had a lab. It went alright.

Oh yeah, Ruby invited Aud and me (as well as other friends) to her party. I'm not sure if I'm going to go, because I've heard things about Ruby's parties. It's not like, drinking or drugs, but like, ""Truth or Dare""--as you've never seen it. That's not like me. I was joking in science to Anthony and Veronica (who both were invited) that, ""Unless we're playing the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen board game, then I'm not coming!"" LOL (something like that.) I live pretty close to her, so... if things got out of hand, I could return home. I'm not into that stuff, you know?

Well, that's all for this first entry. WOOOO!"

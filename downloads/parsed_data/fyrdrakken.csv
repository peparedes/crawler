"event","So I took last night off from work so I could go have a sleep study done.  

One of the results of having a three-day weekend (and not spending a day out of town visiting Dad) was letting my weekend ""to do"" list slide over onto the third day.  Part of this was due to the instructions for the sleep study including leaving a nail bare (or at least with clear polish) so they could put a sensor on that finger to measure my blood oxidation.  My choices were either A) doing a manicure on nine nails Tuesday and leaving one bare till I got home Wednesday morning (and then having to keep a single freshly-polished nail from getting damaged, minimizing my available activities on my free day), B) doing that fancy-tips-over-clear-polish mani I was thinking about trying out, or C) postponing the mani to Wednesday (and also the computerage, since that's the one thing I can do while my nails are drying).  I was more or less planning on doing the clear mani, but visiting Grandma got held over till Tuesday (too much reading Monday morning) and I decided to get my gym session out of the way so I could treat today like a regular Tuesday.  Which is mostly how it's been going (right down to having to do the dishes this morning before I could get started on the computer).

Only yesterday I got a phone call from the doctor's office -- or rather, I <i>missed</i> a call while I was at the gym, and discovered it too late to call back before the office had closed for the day.  Turns out they cancelled my appointment -- too late for me to really change my plans for how I was going to structure my day -- because my insurance company declined to approve the study.  Seems my insurance feels it would be unreasonable to expect them to splash out for a fancy overnight lab session before they've properly diagnosed me with sleep apnea in the first place -- which is entirely reasonable on their part, and in fact I was a bit surprised when I first learned that being assessed for sleep apnea would involve an overnight stay rather than me being sent home with some sort of portable apparatus for self-testing like <i>Mom's</i> allergist had <i>her</i> do a year or two back.  So I need to call them back and probably head on over to pick something up and be instructed in its use, fill out some paperwork, whatever.  I haven't done it yet today -- maybe tomorrow, though I'll probably get home exhausted. 

(One of the great things about having a long weekend is the extra time to catch up on sleep.  This weekend has not been a great one in that regard.  I was up too late last night, since I <i>wasn't</i> going to an appointment and then passed out on the couch trying to watch TV with Mom and couldn't get to sleep once I was properly in bed after that.  Also, had a headache but couldn't motivate myself out of bed to go take something for it until some time this morning.)

Oh, and one more thing -- I found out when checking my timecard last Sunday morning that my supervisor had scheduled me for <i>two</i> nights off when I'd only requested one, which would be awesome except that it appears that she put me down for Monday night as well as Tuesday night, instead of Tuesday night as well as Wednesday night.  And since Monday night is a regular night off for me, that appears to be burning off eight hours of paid time off for a clerical error. (<i>Or</i>, I get to work tonight and discover I wasn't expected to be appearing.  Which I can handle, and save that night off for another time.  Memorial Day is coming up, and then July 4th, so sometime around the beginning of August I'll be ready to give myself a night or two off.  And probably should go visit Dad for a day or two, but anyway.)

<lj-cut text=""In happier news, the roses are blooming."">In happier news, the roses are blooming.

<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Many%20vases%20Sm.jpg"">

I ordered a trio of wee vases of a size suitable for use with very short stems.  Short stems like I wind up with when I take a single floribunda rose from a cluster of buds, or when I want to put mini-roses in a vase because I don't currently have any full-sized ones. (The red clump in the center front row is an entire cluster of mini-roses that were all in bloom simultaneously.)


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Mini-roses%20Sm.jpg"">

Here is the state of the mini-rose bushes:  A great abundance of greenery in the ceramic pots in the iron planter, and a lot of struggling sprigs from last month's purchases. (For comparison, <a href=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Mini%20roses%20Sm.jpg"">here</a> are the red and bright pink roses when I bought them last November -- and those are four very small plants crammed into each of the pots, waiting to be separated and repotted.)</lj-cut>

So the roses are thriving, but the daffodil leaves have gone yellow and collapsed, which apparently means they're due for digging up and replanting.  Also, I have some dead trees (or vastly overgrown bushes) to start sawing branches off of so Mom will have an easier time dealing with them once she gets the chainsaw fixed. (Given the way the red-tipped photinas work, sending up slender saplings from a low central trunk, I suspect I could trim enough away to just ignore the remaining stub until it rots to the point where I can rip it out of the ground.  Because I was ripping loose a lot of rotted stumps a few months ago.) 

The front bed with the row of stargazer lilies (covered with buds, gearing up to bloom in spectacular fashion) has finally been mulched properly, using the last couple of rabbit-cage-cleanings -- now I just need to deal with the weeds already poking up past the mulch.  And dig away the couple of stumps of old dead shrubs left forgotten and ignored in that flowerbed.  And weed around the bases of the four crepe myrtles (which are also budding out and preparing to start blooming).  And put down some sort of covering over the backyard flowerbed to deprive the weeds of sunlight so I can do something with it in the fall.

<lj-cut text=""Not as much knitting as I was planning on doing"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/BlueCatrionas17.jpg"">

At least I'm working my way up the ankle.  I need some more time in front of the TV to get some real progress done on this.  I had really been hoping my night off work would give me some extra time I could spend clearing the DVR this weekend, but it didn't work out that way.  Happily, I'm about done with the long series I was spending the last few weeks reading, which should mean more of my free time should be spent knitting in front of the TV instead...


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/WinterFantasy15.jpg"">

This being a thing I can work on while reading (as well as being the one thing I've had that I could work on at the gym), it's showing visible progress.  Nearly through with the increases -- and the patterning comes soon after that.</lj-cut>

In other news, we have a shiny new metal mailbox with an included metal post.  This because the wood post that had supported our and our neighbor's mailboxes finally rotted away to the point where we couldn't balance the crosspiece on top anymore.  Last week it reached the point where the mailboxes were left sitting in the grass, so the neighbor set up a dowel rod and crosspiece for his own box, and Mom bought us a completely new one that we finally set up on Sunday afternoon. (She noted that where we'd left the rotted wood and the old box by the trash pickup in the alleyway behind the house, someone had come along a day or two later and taken the mailbox itself, leaving the wood behind.) The mailman had to knock on the door to deliver a package today, and complimented me on the new box.  Mom's got a friend who just built a new deck and has some leftover concrete, and he's agreed to come by and use a smidgen of concrete around the base of the post. (Right now it's slightly wobbly in the mud.)

<lj-cut text=""Sky blue mani"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Sky%20Blue%20&%20White%20Lace.jpg"">

These are from the same big package of decals I used <a href=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Spring%20Blue%20Ombre%202.jpg"">last week</a> (aside from the lace tips), but against the lighter background polish you can really see the edges of the stickers.  And I had a hell of a time with decals peeling away from the underlying polish, despite the two layers of topcoat covering them. (I don't recall that being an issue the previous week -- or at least not as much.) 

This week I'm getting back to my striping tape, as soon as I post this entry.  Teal glittery underlayer, with gold for the art layer.</lj-cut>

In kitty news, Rupert is still sneezing periodically but after a worrying few days got his appetite back entirely.  Chooch on the other hand is coughing and I noticed he didn't eat much breakfast.  And I heard another cat sneezing from the kitchen this morning but I'm not sure which one.  

Happily the rabbits are doing quite well.  I still have the faintest lingering trace of a bruise where Stilinski bit me on the arm last week to protest being brushed.  Amelia's the one who's <i>really</i> shedding right now, and while she hasn't tried biting me over it she tends to snub me for a day or two after a grooming.

And, right.  Post this entry, take a quick shower and get ready for bed, and then finish my manicure.  And I can be in bed hours sooner than I've been on most Tuesday nights lately.</lj-cut>

"event","The down side of having two three-day weekends this month is having no overtime pay for those two weeks.  So I've been racking up the extra hours this week to fatten up my next paycheck.  I just hope this week hasn't left me too tired to deal with what I need to Monday, so I can spend my free day knitting in front of the TV. (If I can get my grocery run handled tomorrow, that would be awesome.)

I've also been spending as much of my free time reading as possible for the last few weeks, which has killed my knitting time <i>and</i> eaten into my sleep time.  But I'm almost done with the series I was plowing through...

Rupert seems to be ailing, and I missed the window to get him to the vet this week. (Several days in a row of coming home and passing out immediately.) We'll fuss over him at home for the next few days and see how he does. (I've been syringing water into his mouth to be sure he's drinking, and we need to be giving him something with calories as well.  At least his breathing is better.)

"event","There's a severe thunderstorm blowing in -- I'm hearing thunder outside -- so I'm going to try to whip through this journal entry.  Which is the last thing I have to deal with before shutting down and going to bed. (Aside from the thing where I didn't get my laundry done till this morning, and I need to put the clean sheets onto my bed before I can get into it.  Ah ha hah.)

Fairly decent weekend, aside from spending far too much of yesterday reading.  Also, Mom went to play darts last night, so we didn't get our TV time together.  This could have led to me spending the evening knitting in front of whatever TV I wanted to watch, but mostly led to wasting time on my phone and then reading some more before going to bed past midnight.  And the dishes and my laundry were what got held over to this morning.

<lj-cut text=""Bird nest and roses"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Blue%20Jay%20Nest%20Sm.jpg"">

There was a point where I wasn't seeing the mother bird on the nest anymore and feared something had happened to the eggs, but one day I looked up and saw four bitsy birds poking their heads out and realized the mother had gone from sitting on eggs to constantly feeding hatchlings.  When I took that photo, though, I only saw three wee birds (plus the parent over to the right).  I haven't seen any birds in the nest lately, though, and while I hope that's because they reached the fledgling stage and left the nest...  Well, there are some small blue jay feathers lying in the side flowerbed.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Ebb%20Tide%20Sm.jpg"">

This is the Ebb Tide in full glorious bloom.  It's supposed to be purple -- in cooler weather, at least -- but magenta is a fine shade to be getting in the spring.  I'll be very interested to see what color it gives us in October and November.</lj-cut>

Speaking of small helpless creatures falling prey to our cats, Dizzy brought me a little gift yesterday.  A dead baby bunny, which he carried into the house and laid onto the coffee table.  He mewed at me (""See, I know you like bunnies, so I caught you one!"") and I went to get the dustpan and carry it back out to the yard.  I sent him back out to dispose of his catch but after tossing it around for a while he lost interest and Rupert wound up eating it. (I went to the flowerbed after he was done to make sure he'd completely consumed it, and that's when I found the blue jay feathers.)

<lj-cut text=""Not a lot of knitting this week"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/WinterFantasy14.jpg"">

I worked on this during the movie Friday, but I suspected I had reached the point where I should start the calf increases and stopped knitting.  After I was out of the theater I counted rows and discovered I had in fact gone about four rows past the first increase point, so when I went to visit Grandma that afternoon I unknit those rows and started my increases.</lj-cut>

Sunday Lauren came by with her kids and I retreated to my room.  Mom took them to go see Grandma for Mother's Day, but A) I was exhausted and B) was going to see her the next day, so I stayed home.  I did indeed go yesterday, but she was asleep, and I ran out of time to try again for a visit today.

<lj-cut text=""Glittery ombre"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Spring%20Blue%20Ombre.jpg"">

Simple but attractive.  Inspired by my current pedicure (aqua glitter over midnight blue) but for my fingers I did an aqua-to-midnight ombre and then put the glitter on as a topcoat.  Also, trying out new decals.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Spring%20Blue%20Ombre%202.jpg"">

I ran out of manicure time today, so I'm using the same decals over a flat periwinkle blue.</lj-cut>

And, right.  All done with this, need to go deal with my clean laundry and brush my teeth...</lj-cut>

"event","Two days of coming home, collapsing, and snoozing away the day -- those were Thursday and Saturday.  Happily I got some weeding and light pruning done on Wednesday after the gym and Thursday after waking up.  Yesterday was a total wash in terms of getting anything useful done beyond the bare minimum on my ""to do"" list.

Friday I zipped home from work, had about an hour to attack the daily list of things that need doing before my next shift, and then went to an early showing of <i>Captain America 3</i>. (It was everything I'd hoped for.) After that I went to lunch, visited Grandma, came home and zonked on the couch till Mom got home from work.

Friday was also notable for pets getting shut into places.  I couldn't find Amelia after getting home that afternoon -- turned out when I'd shut the doors on the laundry alcove that morning she'd been lurking behind a machine.  She spent at least six hours shut in with no food or water, but seemed to have suffered no ill effects.  

Then Mom got home and fed the cats but Dizzy was a no-show.  When I was getting ready for work that night I went out into the garage to get some hay for the bunnies and discovered Dizzy had snuck through the door when Mom got home from work and been stuck in the garage for hours.  I had to feed him before I left.  Squeaky was dying to come help himself to the meal -- I made Mom hold him so Dizz could eat in peace while I gave the bunnies their greens and topped up their water bowl.

So today's Mother's Day and I gave Mom her new ring earlier.  Lauren arrived with her kids at the most inconvenient time -- Mom and I were both in the bathroom and neither of us could get up quickly to let them in.  Lauten pried open one of the backyard gates and came in through the back door while I was washing my hands. Now they're off visiting Grandma and I need to get back out of bed and go tend the bunnies before I fall asleep. (I started refilling water bowls earlier but Mom decided it was time to do dishes <i>right exactly then</i>, so I postponed the rest of the task until she was done using the sink and forgot to resume.)

"event","I'm glad I got a lot of needed gardening done on Thursday, because Sunday I got home from the gym and spent the whole afternoon reading until I passed out.  I wish I'd at least got up to take a naproxen when I realized I had a headache, because I zonked out without doing so and woke up with a much worse headache that lasted all Monday.

Monday kicked off with a thunderstorm -- I woke in the wee hours listening to the thunder (and to Mom letting in the cats who'd gotten caught out in it) wondering why I was still wearing my glasses if I'd shut off the lamp on my bedside table.  Power outage?  No, the ceiling fan was still going... (Turned out the bulb had burned out in the bedside lamp.) I spent too much time reading Monday morning and wound up leaving the vacuuming <i>and</i> the dishes for this morning (and getting my nails ready for a new manicure besides) -- at least I got them done without a lot of time-wasting today.

<lj-cut text=""Not a lot of knitting"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/WinterFantasy13.jpg"">

I've been working on this part of the time while reading, as well as at the gym.  And now I'm wondering whether I should do something else at the gym tomorrow and save this for when I go see the new Captain America movie -- or whether this week I can get through the sixteen rows I have before I reach the increase rows.  I can do increases in a movie theater, but if I'm still on the ankle I won't be able to tell in the dark when it's time to start increasing for the calf.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/BlueCatrionas16.jpg"">

I reached the heel yesterday while visiting Grandma.  And then last night in front of the TV with Mom I realized I'd made the heel slightly too narrow and need to rip back the few heel rows I've already done.  So I need to do that before I forget and pick it back up and just keep knitting...</lj-cut>

The mini-roses I repotted on Wednesday and Thursday are in the anemic stage where they're dropping leaves and tipping over sideways in their new pots and I'm waiting to see which ones seem likely to survive.  Meanwhile, I have all the coral pink roses I could want, and I've got a couple of floribundas that are in a mood to bloom.  The Heirloom has already given me a couple of handsome lilac blooms to perfume the living room, and the first Ebb Tide bud is opening. (Not purple but maybe sort of magenta or fuchsia.) I need some more tiny bud vases for the short-stemmed floribundas and mini-roses -- I've only got one right now.

The rain brought in a cold front, so I'll be back in long-sleeved undershirts at work this week.  The roses are enjoying the watering, at least.  More rain coming later this week... (I could do with a cool and rainy spring and on into summer, frankly.)

Yesterday I surveyed the dead trees that need to come down and really thought about how many limbs are slender enough for me to attack myself with handsaw and large pruning shears.  I could clear out some room and certainly make things easier for when Mom finally gets the chain back on the chainsaw -- I remember doing a lot of small-branch snipping when she attacked the tree that fell over a few months ago.  There are also a few living trees that we're going to keep but could do with pruning, because the branches are low enough to hit Mom when she tries to mow or because they're rubbing against other branches (or other trees).  Think that's my next big gardening task -- another major round of pruning in the backyard. (Which is going to involve moving some light strands and lanterns off branches that are going to go.)

Also, I had a problem when I tried to transplant the oak seedlings.  Seems that A) I had put a scrap of kitchen sponge in the bottom of the pot to keep potting soil from leaking out the drainage hole in the bottom and B) I had left the seedlings in the pot far too long before attempting to plant them in the ground.  The roots had inextricably wound themselves through the sponge and I wound up maiming their roots trying to free them.  So the seedlings went on the compost heap, and I got one of the acorns out of the freezer (set there to get the appropriate winter chill in case the acorns in the pot outside didn't sprout) and stuck it in the circle I'd cleared in the front lawn. (Mom and I need to get some edging for that circle, and I'll enlarge the bare patch to fit.  That's where I'll be planting bulbs to surround the sapling.)

<lj-cut text=""Vivid mani"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Tropical%20Sunset.jpg"">

This mani thrilled the hell out of me.  The photo doesn't do the base coat justice.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Tropical%20Sunset%202.jpg"">

This was closer but still not quite as vivid as the real colors.  The base shade was a pretty close match for the nameless roses from the bush in the sideyard.

Today's mani is another of those ombres with decals over the top.  Inspired by my current pedi, actually -- aqua glitter over midnight blue -- only for the mani I did a aqua-to-midnight ombre and then came the glitter topcoat.  And white decals on every finger, because why not make it more complicated?

One of these days I'm going to make enough time for another fancy-pants mani with striping tape.  Not today, though, but maybe next week.</lj-cut>

I managed to check Delicious for things I'd tagged for gifts for Mom and none of them inspired me.  Then I had a look at what had hit Woot.com that day and looking through the jewelry found a ring that looked like something Mom might like, and showed it to her and asked what size she's currently wearing.  She liked it -- but the one next to it on the page even more -- so now I've got her Mother's Day gift in a little box on my desk waiting for Sunday.

So, hmm.  I hit post on this entry and I'm basically done with my ""to do"" list for the day.  I could stand to get something to eat -- carefully, since my nails are still hardening from their final coat -- and watch a little TV before bed... (I wonder if I dare risk unknitting those heel rows on that blue stocking?  I don't want to go too many days without correcting the mistake and risk forgetting about it...)</lj-cut>

"event","I missed out on visiting Grandma last week.  Thursday was a deliberate decision to get some weeding and repotting done at home instead.  Friday I came home and passed out and slept pretty much all day.  

Saturday my mother babysat  for my sister again -- though only for the baby this time -- and said she was going to take him to see Grandma while she had him.  I fell asleep and woke too late to visit Grandma myself. (And I think Mom didn't get to visit, either, due to issues fitting the cat seat into her car.  I suspect this may be the first time Mom's babysat the baby in which she was actually provided with the car seat -- either it's a pain in the ass to remove the part that attaches into Lauren's car, or her husband specifically refuses to leave Mom with it because he doesn't feel she needs to be taking his kids anywhere. Yeah.)

So today I've racked up a goodly amount of overtime to start the week off and now I'm free for the day.  Though tomorrow will go that little bit more smoothly if I get my grocery run done this afternoon or evening...

"event","So having a massive thunderstorm with possible hail, tornadoes, etc. supposedly blowing into town on my one computer day of the week is inconvenient.  On the other hand, it's forced me not to waste time this morning, as I've had to prioritize based on A) which things on today's ""to do"" list can be done during a thunderstorm (dishes, getting ready for work tonight), B) which computer things require the most time (running my backups, which meant the things that had to be done before I could <i>run</i> the backups had to happen very early in the process today), and C) which things I could theoretically do on my phone if I had to shut down the computer early. (Shopping for a Mother's Day gift is likely to be postponed slightly anyway because Delicious is down and that's where I had ideas bookmarked for future shopping needs.  If I have to get offline abruptly, I can save this draft as a private entry and finish it by editing with my phone app.)

Being at the mercy of unpredictable weather has been a useful motivator, since it's been a really lazy unproductive weekend up to today.  Mom babysat for Lauren's kids Sunday, and the only advance notice I had was overhearing Mom on the phone with Lauren Saturday night while I was getting ready for work.  I put in two and a half hours of overtime Sunday morning, and when I got home the kids were already there.  I dropped off my stuff and turned around and went to the gym (having zoned out on the drive home and forgotten to swing by for my cardio on the way), and then after that hid out in my room for the entire afternoon.  I could theoretically have been avoiding the kids outside, doing some of the long list of gardening activities I had that I was hoping to deal with on my free day, but by the time I got home from the gym I didn't want to do anything but read.  All afternoon, and I heard when my sister arrived to collect the boys but she hung around visiting for <i>ages</i> and I'm not sure if she was still in the house when I fell asleep or if they cleared out shortly before I zonked out.

So I woke up at 12:40 after Mom had gone to bed, and I could have done something productive with my time (like going on my grocery run) but I settled for tending the bunnies (neglected all day Sunday and kept in their cage besides), getting a snack, and brushing my teeth.  Then I read for a few hours while letting the bunnies run around, tucked them away and went back to bed for a few hours, and got up and wasted too much time getting up and showered and dressed.

And when I say I wasted too much time, I mean that I got out of the shower and discovered I had less than fifteen minutes to get dressed and drive to my 11am dentist's appointment.  And also that the power went out at some point between me getting up and me getting into the shower, so I had to find clothes in the dark using my phone as a flashlight.  This slowed me down -- and so did knocking a bunch of nail polish off my desk in the dark while I was picking up my purse.  I wound up being ten minutes late for my appointment -- which wasn't actually too much of an issue, since I had to sit and wait to be seen anyway.  I had time to braid back my wet hair before I was called.

It wasn't a bad trip to the dentist as such things go, and I enjoyed getting to sit and read and knit a little while I was waiting for the dentist to inspect my mouth and then for the hygienist to come deal with me.  It ate two hours of my afternoon, though.  I got out of there and went to see Grandma, then I decided that A) going on my grocery run hungry was a bad idea (I hadn't had time for breakfast before rushing off to the dentist) but B) going home for lunch and giving myself opportunities to waste time before leaving the house again would be a tactical error.  So I went out to lunch and then made my grocery run.  

Got home and wasted a certain amount of time but at least I got my laundry done and the rabbit cage cleaned and was sweeping up before the vacuuming when Mom got home from work.  I did the vacuuming, we blew off the shared pizza (I wasn't hungry after my late lunch and Mom just wanted a salad), and then after watching John Oliver and <i>Game of Thrones</i> I was too tired to get up without napping for a few hours.  When Mom went to bed I woke up and managed to get the bunnies into bed and deal with putting my laundry away and remaking my bed.  I got a snack and crashed for a few hours, and the dishes and getting my nails ready for today's manicure wound up postponed to today.

<lj-cut text=""Many lights"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Solar%20Lights%20Sm.jpg"">

I've been vaguely thinking I should take a photo of what the backyard looks like now, with all the stranded lights and lanterns.  Everything is solar-powered, so I'm having to readjust the positioning of some of the solar sensors now that the leaves have come in and some of the sensors are being blocked. (I'd probably have better results if the strand light sensors were plugged into the ground on their attached stakes as intended -- but I want the electrical cords up out of the reach of bunnies, so that means wedging them into forks of trees.) This is the view of the side fence, and it's going to wind up being rearranged as some more of the dead trees get removed.

<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Solar%20Lights%202%20Sm.jpg"">

This is the view of the back fence, and I'm going to be adding some more strands to the trees along here, but I'm also going to be freeing up a few strands that are on trees I want to cut down, so I think I'll hold off on buying any more for a while.</lj-cut>

So there is a thing I'd been contemplating doing for a while.  I have two credit cards I owed money on, but my savings account had gradually built up to the point where I could pay off the lesser card in a single payment.  I was a bit wary of actually doing so, since I didn't want to completely wipe out the savings account -- after all, that's the cushion the bank dips into if my checking account is overdrawn (and the account I make an emergency transfer from if I get sufficient warning that I'm <i>about to be</i> overdrawn -- if the bank pulls the money out, they throw in a $10 service charge).  But the money in my savings earns me a measly single cent in interest per month, whereas the card was charging me roughly $20 in finance fees per month, so I'd be in better shape clearing out that debt.  

I had a really good paycheck Friday (a fair bit of overtime, and I had a modest pay raise that kicked in this month) and it gave me enough past my bills and anticipated expenses to pay off that card and leave me with $400 in my savings.  So I did that, and now I'm going to be making two payments per month on the other card and focusing on getting that balance whittled away.  Making a special point of picking up a few hours of overtime each week is going to be important, but even more useful is the part where I've finally met my health insurance deductible, since that's been really racking up the charges on the card lately.  Of course, this being where I have only one thing left at the allergy doc's (that being the sleep study to see if I need a CPAP machine), I'm just going to hope that I remember to claim for the medical expenses on next year's tax return, and that it actually has an effect on how much I get back. (I forgot to try that after I had the colonscopy that racked up so much on that card a year or two back.)

Here's hoping I don't wind up with any sudden unexpected vet bills or car repairs. Ah ha hah.

<lj-cut text=""Minimal knitting this week"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/WinterFantasy12.jpg"">

I focused on this project this week because it was what I could do at the gym and while reading, but also so I could get the heel out of the way.  I did the transition from the heel to the ankle yesterday at the dentist's office, and got the last loose ends woven away this morning while waiting on my computer to do something or other.  So in the coming week, expect to see more progress on this, but also hopefully some more work on the other blue stocking.  It depends on how much free time I spend reading vs. in front of the TV.</lj-cut>

I have gardening I need to do.  The two beds in the front of the house need weeding (I was hoping to get in there after a rain so the ground would be soft -- tomorrow or Thursday, maybe?), and the bed alongside the garage in the backyard I'm going to resort to drastic measures with.  I'm going to tack black plastic over it for a few weeks (or months) to kill what's under it, and then this fall add compost and plant lots of bulbs. (That's the bed with poison ivy <i>and</i> the remains of a fallen tree in it.  Also it's the bed that killed off the rosebushes Mom planted when we first moved into the house and the yellow rosebush that had been there since before Mom moved in.  Mom thinks it was the poison ivy, I suspect a disease, but either way I'm not risking roses in that area.) 

More pressingly, I have three oak seedlings in a pot that need to go into the ground sooner rather than later, and a couple of pots of mini-roses that need repotting immediately if not sooner.  I want one of each color in the round ceramic pots in the wrought-iron holder -- but I ony have one of those pots free right now.  The other has to wait for me to do some transplanting this winter.  Eventually all the mini-roses not in that plant stand are going in a front flowerbed (unless I keep a few in the one big pot on the patio that's standing empty), but I'd rather transplant them all into individual small pots for now and see which survive.  I need to do this sooner rather than later, since the leaves are starting to get brown edges. (Possibly from going Sunday without having been watered, since I didn't get around to refilling pet water bowls till the wee hours Monday morning, and the previous day's water goes to the mini-roses.)

There is a particular shade of pinky-orange that I tend to think of as <a href=""http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/65063/"">Tropicana</a> because of the rosebush Mom used to have.  On looking at the photos online, I don't think the bush in the sideyard is a Tropicana, but it's a really enthusiastic color nonetheless. (Salmon? Coral?) I'm really looking forward to seeing how it goes in a vase with one of the purple Ebb Tide blooms, once a few of <i>those</i> buds open... 

<lj-cut text=""Monochrome manicure"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Silver%20Black%20Ombre.jpg"">

Complete lack of inspiration here, and I miscalculated by adding a second coat of the black glitter, since it darkened the blend region too much.  Looked a bit like the view from the surface of the moon though, especially with the few stars present in the silver glitter I added.

Today's manicure is a tropical sunset ombre, and the base pinky-orange is a near-match to the rose I snipped off the sideyard bush yesterday.</lj-cut>

And so!  Here I am at the end of my computer-related ""to do"" list, as soon as I post this entry.  I still have things that need doing before bedtime.  I also still have nails that need drying time before I can do much of anything else (and in fact need a second layer of topcoat before my mani is completely finished), so I'm likely to stay on the computer reading for a little while longer.  But if the weather goes from ominously windy to the promised thunderstorms, I can shut down quickly and go deal with other things. (Alternately, I might get the chance to repot at least one set of mini-roses, once I'm done with getting ready for work tonight and giving my nails ample time to harden.)</lj-cut>

"event","So the entry I had planned today was about driving back from the trip to the rabbit sanctuary for the next month's box of hay and admiring the gardens in a neighborhood I don't drive through that often and contemplating how the same plants are showing up in front of house after house. (How much is retained landscaping from the developers who built the neighborhood, how much due to the same landscaping services and gardeners working at multiple houses in an area, and how much down to the selection available at local gardening stores?)

Irises, irises everywhere, in clumps and patches, in rings around trees, and in one yard where they'd been allowed to take over. (Our own irises are patchy and already bloomed -- evidently I should plant some more for Mom this fall, in the front flowerbeds and around the oak seedling I haven't planted in the front yard yet.) The colors varied, but it was the same flower all over.  

Though one yard a few houses away from the rabbit sanctuary had replaced its entire lawn with an array of flowers springing knee-high or taller in an array of colors.  Amaryllis was the one I recognized, in banks of red blooms -- most of the others I did not, but the effect was magnificent.  I slowed the car driving past to gawk.

Roses everywhere, great fountains of the same red.  I envy the plants for their size, vigor, and dozens of blooms -- if I'd started planting a few years ago, I might have roses like that now, instead of cheering on each individual bloom -- but wish for a greater variety of colors.

In any case, I came home and lay down in my room to nap without being disturbed by Mom after an hour's sleep. (Which is the main problem with napping on the couch on weekends.) Woke up at 10:20 -- ten minutes before the first alarm goes off -- and went, ""Ack! I had stuff to do today!"" Got up and plugged in my phone to charge, filled my fruit cup, brushed my teeth, and started on my routine for preparing for work.  Finished up with a few minutes to post a quick entry after all...

"event","Yesterday was my appointment to go see the allergist and get the results from my allergy tests -- which, they wanted me to discuss them after the fact with a doctor instead of just the nurse telling me when she did the scratch tests on my back and saw which allergens got a reaction.  So I went in and spent a lot of time waiting in various rooms for just a few minutes with a different doctor than the one I saw the last time. (I liked this one more -- the other doc seemed to want me to justify not ever having been married when I explained why I have no idea whether I snore or not.  This doc noted that since I was wearing a Princess Leia T-shirt she felt she could ask me whether she needs to see all six of the older films or just the original trilogy.) The upshot is that my only food allergies are a vague sensitivity to almond with lesser reactions to peanut and walnut and buckwheat and maybe one or two other things -- but my pollen allergies are extensive and vicious. (And also, I'm highly allergic to mites.) And I set up the appointment for a sleep study -- which reminds me that I need to put in the request to get that night off from work.

Despite the hours spent at the doctor's office, I came to the end of the day with nothing from the ""to do"" list saved for this morning but the dishes, getting my nails ready for today's manicure, and doing my pedicure.  And I mostly took care of that in good time this morning -- but I wasted a number of hours screwing around on my phone rather than getting up and onto the computer.  I think my internal schedule for Tuesdays is broken -- 2pm is starting to feel like the right time to turn on the computer, and that's not a good time.  Even if I make a point of doing everything else I need to do before work that night by the time I get around to the computerage, it's a late start.

<lj-cut text=""A fair amount of time spent in front of the TV last week"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/SweetHeart13.jpg"">

Finished, hooray!  A bit too late in the year to wear them unless we get a <i>serious</i> cold snap, but I may wear them this week just once to enjoy them while the triumph is still fresh before I put them away.  The stranding makes them warm enough that I'd probably only want to wear them when it's chilly enough to have on leggings beneath my pants. (Because chilly enough for these socks is too cold to wear short socks without an extra layer on my calves.)


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/WinterFantasy11.jpg"">

I did indeed finally make it to see <i>Deadpool</i> on Saturday.  Between that, my gym knitting, and I think a few rows while reading, I'm nearly to the heel on the second sock.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/BlueCatrionas15.jpg"">

Hey, remember this pair?  I had nearly forgotten, but they were waiting patiently for me to finish the Sweet Heart Socks and need something else with a slightly fiddly pattern to work on in front of the TV.  So I'll be working on these for the next few weeks, because I could definitely use a pair of blue kneesocks. (Two pairs, counting the Winter Fantasy pair.)</lj-cut>

I spent the week stressing over the bank's daily text messages being in such distinct disagreement with my own running tally for what's in my checking account.  I checked the mobile app for a quick glance at my account but couldn't find the problem until I was able to sit down in front of the desktop today so I could look at my checkbook program on my phone and compare it to my bank statement on a separate screen.  Turns out a withdrawal had gotten entered as a deposit in my checkbook app, but also another transaction may have been entered twice.  At least now the bank and I agree.  And at least they didn't cancel and reissue my debit card <i>again</i>.

<lj-cut text=""Freehanded mani"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Dawn%20Sky%202.jpg"">

This made me really happy.  There was a painting I did in high school art class that I had up on the wall in my bedroom until I went to college.  The foreground images were uninspiring but I <i>loved</i> the dawn sky I'd done.  This is me trying to recreate that sky on my nails and I came close enough to be very pleased with it all week. (This is why I didn't get my nails ready for today's mani until this morning -- I liked last week's mani too much to peel it off until the last minute.)


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Dawn%20Sky.jpg"">

Here's the closeup, with silver dots for stars and pink streaks for clouds.  I tried to add a little glow-in-the-dark polish on the stars, but I don't think I got enough to have an effect.

Today's mani is simple but presentable, a black-over-silver ombre.  The blend region got a little darker than it needed to be, but I added a lot of silver glitter over the black tips and a few stars as well.</lj-cut>

Right, that's it.  Need to hit post on this entry, weigh my leftover yarn from the Sweet Heart Socks so I can see exactly how much I used and note it on my Ravelry project page, and then brush my teeth and go to bed...</lj-cut>

"event","The plan for today was to come home, whip through the daily ""to do"" list, finally get around to going to see <i>Deadpool</i>, and then visit Grandma on the way home from the movie.  Instead I walked in the door, let the bunnies out of their cage, and fell asleep on the couch while clearing my e-mail inbox.

On the plus side, this has been an excellent week for knitting in front of the TV (at the cost of some sleep time yesterday and Wednesday) and today I bound off the second of my Sweet Heart Socks.  Now I need to spend a few days contemplating what new pattern from my Ravelry queue to cast on for.  And also work on finishing the Ballyronan Cowl, and the blue Winter Fantasy stockings, and the other pair of blue kneesocks I've had hibernating... (There's another Mercury retrograde coming up in a week or two, which means I'm about due for another period of finishing up as many projects as I can manage.)

"event","Got everything -- <i>everything</i> -- on the ""to do"" list done yesterday, which left me feeling so wealthy in free time this morning that I didn't get around to turning on the computer till 3pm.  But at least that meant knitting while reading and then in front of the TV for a few hours, rather than trying to get myself moving to clean the rabbit cage and vacuum. (Getting the cage out of the way earlier Monday and saving things like dishes and the grocery run for later turned out to be key.)

<lj-cut text=""Knitting"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/WinterFantasy10.jpg"">

Toe done, loose ends woven away.  Now it's ready for the gym, the movie theater, or knitting while reading.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/PurpleTurquoise10.jpg"">

And this got one final week of being my gym knitting.  I got the toe of the blue stocking done by Sunday and made a point of working on this while reading for a while.  It's going back into hibernation now, until the second blue stocking reaches the colorwork section or I need a change of pace when it comes to plain stockinette.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/SweetHeart12.jpg"">

And I got more work done on these than I'd realized.  The leg pattern is worked three times up from the heel and then it's time for the cuff -- and I just started the third pattern repeat this morning.</lj-cut>

I had to call the bank again earlier today.  Seems their claims department decided I'd been double-paid for that Netflix account someone else is running on my dime and responded by pulling that money back out of my checking account.  The problem being A) that I seem to have have had two separate claims handling the issue and each one resolved the matter by taking the same amount of money away, and B) that I never filed a claim on the February charge to bring it to the bank's attention (since I'd been doubly-paid in January and thought the bank had done it on purpose to compensate in advance for February).  So I directed the claims department's attention to the duplicate claims and the February charge, and while I was on the phone bitched about being charged a $15 rush fee to get my replacement debit card after someone cancelled it in March unnecessarily, without notification, and without sending me a replacement card.  The guy I talked to today assured me that I'd be refunded the $15 and that today's phone calls (I had to call <i>twice</i> because my first call was dropped when I was being transferred to the claims department) won't result in my card being cancelled again.  I'll believe it when I see it, but anyway.

<lj-cut text=""Lazy mani"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Black%20Rainbows.jpg"">

I was really looking forward to this mani, but it disappointed me.  I had a hell of a time positioning the tips so they'd look right when I removed the corners that stuck up past the edges of my nails -- and I think I'd have liked them better if they were just rainbows, no animal patterns.

Today's mani made me really very happy.  A dawn sky, largely an ombre but with some freehanding for pink cloud streaks and little silver stars.</lj-cut>

So I've got my backups running while I've been typing this entry, and I've been having to type just a few words at a time because every few seconds Firefox stops responding and makes me wait for it to catch up with what I just did.  It's probably made this entry shorter than it otherwise might have been -- but maybe not, because I'm not sure I had that much to say tonight. (Though it's taken a long time to say what little there was.) Anyway.  Time to post this and hit the sack...</lj-cut>

"event","One more tardy Friday night, due to oversleeping after a week of never catching up on all the sleep I needed.  And a mockingbird got into the building that night shortly before dawn, swooping around and around the room seeking an exit.  I was on my way to the bathroom and didn't see what happened next, but someone was holding the doors open for it, so I suspect it was able to find its way out.

"event","Oh, those assholes at Bank of America.  So they had failed to correctly handle the Netflix account someone set up using my debit card in January's data breach, and then when I called them about it a couple of weeks ago they had cancelled my current debit card as a kneejerk reaction (despite having already issued me a new card in January when the initial problem occurred).  Bad enough to annoy me with a new card to change various accounts and payments to -- but they had neglected to notify me of the cancellation, and -- according to the customer service rep I called to ask why my card was being declined -- they had <i>also</i> forgotten to send me a new card.  So he told me he'd put a rush on the new card and it would get to me in the next business dary or two.  So it did indeed arrive the second business day from that phone call -- but today I logged into my bank account and discovered I had been charged a $15 rush fee.  Without being told by the CS rep.  And, again, as part of fixing yet another mistake BoA had made with my account. (I'd consider calling them up to shriek about it and demand a refund, had I not been given a refund by Netflix <i>and</i> BoA for the unauthorized charge made to my account two weeks ago.  That cancels out all but a couple-three bucks of the rush fee, and that amount isn't worth calling customer service over.)

Interesting scheduling variation this weekend -- I crashed sometime between 4 and 5pm Sunday, woke up a little past midnight, went to IHOP in the wee hours Monday morning and then made my grocery run before dawn.  Came home and went to bed to nap for a few more hours -- wound up sleeping till noon, though, and had to pick which parts of the ""to do"" list to save for Tuesday. (Visiting Grandma and doing the dishes, it turned out being, and I'd had hopes of getting the dishes done before Mom came home or after we ate, but I wound up passing out for a couple of hours after dinner.)

<lj-cut text=""Some amount of knitting done"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/WinterFantasy9.jpg"">

Slowly worked my way through the second season of <i>Daredevil</i> last week and got this done in the process.  Maybe I should start working on the second season of <i>Agent Carter</i> this week?


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/PurpleTurquoise9.jpg"">

And this has been my gym knitting.  Some time lost to detangling yarn on Friday -- I had to rewind the purple skein into a ball after I got home from the gym that day.  But now it's easy to swap colors and I have enough sock done to stuff the other color down inside out of the way.</lj-cut>

So I got a late start on the computerage because I spent the earlier part of the day A) sleeping late, B) having breakfast and doing dishes, and C) going through the list of things that need to be done each day before I have a shift at work.  And then I went to see Grandma in the middle of the afternoon.  Happily I didn't waste a lot of time shuffling files and clearing things out.

<lj-cut text=""Simple ombre"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Pink%20Purple%20Ombre.jpg"">

Two pinks and a purple -- though actually the base coat was about three different similar pinks layered over each other, to add depth and sparkle to a polish that would give me a solid color but not a lot of visual interest.

Today's mani is rainbow tip decals over a plain black base coat, and I would have gotten it finished much earlier but they were water decals and I had to pry myself away from the computer.  I wound up taking a quick shower and dressing for bed before adding the decals, which was probably wise.  Now I just hope the topcoat is dry enough to avoid smudging it in bed...</lj-cut>

Happily, whatever server glitch ended my work shift prematurely on the two preceding Sundays seems to have been fixed, so I was able to work Sunday morning until I was ready to leave.  Unhappily, they had extra people in, but no one extra to help with the data entry, and I had to leave way more work undone than I was happy about.  Also, the priority stuff that <i>must</i> be done didn't get entered, because those specimens weren't even processed till after the technical end of my shift, and I don't know if that's because they arrived late or because someone sorting incoming work didn't set them aside as priority work or just the people opening specimens were so overloaded with work left over from Saturday morning that they were ignoring a lot of the new work that was coming in.  Anyway.  So there needs to be more of a process in place for identifying when the Saturday night crew is going to be overloaded and needs extra people coming in.  But for now, I just need to get into bed and see if I can get a bit of a nap in before work tonight...</lj-cut>

"event","Being annoyed by family right now, since Mom arranged for my sister to cut Mom's sister's hair and for some damned reason decided they needed to meet up at our place on a Saturday afternoon instead of one of them going to the other's house.  So I was aggravated during my watching of the last couple of eps of <i>Daredevil</i> by Mom bustling around trying to clean so her stay-at-home-housewife sister wouldn't see how the house usually looks.  

And this after Mom having come into the living room and sat down in front of the final episode of a TV show she had watched none of the preceding two seasons of (which I hate because she's prone to think she can follow along with whatever I happen to be watching if she just asks me enough questions) and then pulled out her phone to try to talk to my sister in the middle of my show, when there were a whole houseful of other rooms she could have been in instead of expecting me to just ignore her or pause my show until she was finished. (Best of all, it wasn't even a conversation -- it was a butt-dial on my sister's part, and Mom sitting there for two minutes realizing out loud that Lauren wasn't really even on the line at all, before deciding that she needed to hang up and call Lauren to tell her about how her phone had just called Mom.  When Lauren was going to be walking in the door in mere minutes -- in fact, when Lauren and the kids arrived is when I came to my room to finish my show.)

After I post this I'm going to go visit Grandma.  I went yesterday but it turned out she'd been moved from her wheelchair to her bed just before I arrived and was already asleep. (And I didn't go Thursday because I came home from work and almost immediately passed out on the couch till 7pm, past her bedtime.) Hopefully she's still up today. (Well, she should be, because the nursing home staff start bringing dinner trays around 5pm or 5:30.) 

I sincerely hope the company has gone home when I get back so I can get to sleep, because tonight is going to be <i>awesome</i> since we had a lot of people out last night and it bottlenecked the workload before it got down to the data entry people, so there's going to be a lot of last night's work to deal with when we get there.  At least there'll be some extras coming in to pick up the slack -- though the last time that happened, the other three data entry people basically quit working about twenty minutes before the end of the shift and just sat around gossiping and laughing before leaving me to put in some overtime and try to get it finished alone. (Well, not quite alone -- one other guy who was there on a different job started doing data entry along with me when he finished his other work.) 

I didn't quite manage to get everything finished the Sunday before last because some sort of computer glitch happened and killed my server connection a little past 10am, and I couldn't get back into the system after that.  I had very little work left and was in overtime (and was about to leave for a four-day weekend), so I just left -- but last Sunday the same damned thing happened, at 7am this time, and a few minutes later it kicked the other data entry person out as well.  I was on the phone with IT when she lost the connection, and the person I was talking to claimed I'd be getting called back within just a few minutes, so we waited.  At the end of our shift (a little earlier for the other person, a little later for me) we left, still unable to connect, and with a lot of work left over that we damned well should have been able to get finished in the time we wasted sitting around. (I left a note on my supervisor's desk so she'd know what had happened, and gave the IT ticket number to someone else whose shift ran later into the morning.  She said she'd try to call them back herself in a bit.)

So I'm going in to work expecting a long and potentially frustrating shift, and I very much doubt I'll get more than four hours of sleep before I go. (Here's hoping Mom doesn't come up with some household task requiring extra muscle that she wants me to help her with tomorrow afternoon when I'm ready to pass out.)

"event","So I have let myself save not just the vacuuming but the rabbit cage cleaning as well until Tuesday for too many weeks in a row -- it's turning into a very bad habit.  And today I wasted many hours after breakfast on my phone procrastinating about getting up and dealing with what needed doing.  Which is why I didn't deal with the rabbit cage and vacuuming till the afternoon, and then didn't sit down at the computer till close to 7pm.

I got everything done but posting this entry and decided to save it till tomorrow.  I lay down in bed to try to at least nap before work, but after fifteen or twenty minutes resigned myself to the fact that I was too tense at how little time I had left before my first alarm would go off to get any sleep at all.  So I got back up to get this done.

I have <i>got</i> to retrain myself.  Moving a few items from the Monday routine to Sunday only happens occasionally -- I'm too tired on Sundays. (And also that turns into the day for doing gardening stuff, as well as being the one day of the week Mom feels like she can justifiably demand my assistance on any job that's more than she can handle by herself.  I'd object less if she didn't keep springing this stuff on me at the last minute, or not getting herself moving and ready to start working on a task until the mid to late afternoon when I'm about to crash.) And the weekly computerage and weekly manicure are so linked I can't really see myself as moving any part of either to any day but Tuesdays.  So I have <i>got</i> to stop letting the rabbit cage slide.

Maybe the problem is I should get the rabbit cage done early in the day, when I'm energetic and have that whole list of things needing doing to motivate me.  Dishes are a lot easier to make myself do last thing on a Monday when I'd rather just crash in front of the TV.  Or the grocery run, for that matter -- once I'm up and moving, I'm all right, or it can be postponed till Tuesday morning with a lot less procrastination as a result.

And I spent a day or two visiting Dad last week, and didn't take any knitting progress photos last Tuesday, so I've got visible progress now.

<lj-cut text=""Currently knitting"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/WinterFantasy8.jpg"">

And here I am on the ribbing.  This is the top priority until I get this stocking bound off and the toe of the second one done. (Happily, knitting ribbing and sock toes I can do while visiting Grandma.)


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/SweetHeart11.jpg"">

Visible progress, though I'm well past my arbitrary deadline of Valentine's Day.  And these are going to be warm little socks -- I may not actually wear them till next fall, aside from perhaps once as a triumphal gesture right after I finally get them finished.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/PurpleTurquoise8.jpg"">

And these are my gym knitting, still, until I'm onto the foot of the second blue stocking.</lj-cut>

The good news being that my new debit card arrived today (via overnight shipping) and I was able to plug it into a few accounts that had pending charges that weren't going to go through because of being based on the now-cancelled card.  Netflix actually had some kind of a hold on my account because of the call I made to their fraud department a week ago, and I had to call them up to let them know it was really me making this payment change. (Turns out Paypal is now an option.  I went with that just so my account wouldn't be affected by any more debit card changes.) The bad news of course being that it was one more thing I was doing with my evening that ate up time I could have spent sleeping before work.

<lj-cut text=""Neon Easter nails"">

I really wish those tip decals didn't start peeling so quickly, because they look wonderful.  And this was a pretty good manicure for such a hasty job, aside from the way it started chipping within a day or two.  I really like putting a coat of Sinful Colors over China Glaze -- the two polishes work well together to make something durable -- but I'm running way low on my bottle of Sinful Colors clear.  And I apparently made a poor choice of topcoats for this mani.

That decal looked <i>so good</i> over that turquoise polish.  Crying shame it lasted so poorly.

This week is a three-color ombre with no decals or fancy detailing.  Looks good and the pink-and-purple color scheme is very spring flowers.  I kind of would have liked to add at least a few accent decals, but I felt the need to give them time to dry before bed.</lj-cut>

And my first alarm has gone off, with the second just a few minutes away.  Time to post this and start getting ready for work...</lj-cut>

"event","Here is an important thing I have learned this week: If you had an outbreak of fraudulent charges to your checking account because someone stole your debit card number, and one of the things the fraudster did was to set themself up with Netflix on your dime, and two months after the bank sorted out your claim you see that you've been billed for someone else's streaming video AGAIN -- don't call the bank to bitch that their fraud department failed to adequately handle a recurring charge.  Call Netflix and talk to *their* fraud department.  Because the Netflix rep seems to have been able to search on my debit card number and find the other account using it (even if she couldn't tell me anything about what she discovered).  

And because Bank of America's kneejerk response to a security breach is to cancel the card and issue a new one.  Even for a breach that happened two months ago and already got me a new debit card at the time.  BoA also failed to notify me that my card had been cancelled (I had to figure it out on my own after a series of declined transactions), and according to the rep I talked to this morning apparently ALSO neglected to issue me a new card to replace the one they stopped.

"event","So I got all the sleep I needed on Sunday night (and slept fairly late into Monday morning) yet I still ran out of energy late in the afternoon when I should have been cleaning the bunny cage.  And I <i>really</i> should have dealt with the rabbit cage and the vacuuming yesterday, since I'm leaving to go visit Dad just as soon as I get off the computer.  Since I got a really late start on the computerage, I'm cutting some corners and postponing some things to next week.  Also, I'm just doing decals for my Easter mani, instead of the striping-tape extravaganza I had been planning on.

I did have a really pleasant morning, though, letting the bunnies out to play in the yard while I watered roses and cleaned the cage and took care of things I won't be here to deal with tomorrow.  They got all the outside time they wanted -- they wandered back into the house on their own at one point, and then were back out in the yard while I was getting ready to vacuum.  And then when I told them, ""INSIDE! Indoor bunnies!"" they went scampering back to the house without making me chase them all around the yard, so it goes to show that rabbits are indeed trainable. (Another reason I felt guilty about not cleaning the cage yesterday evening -- the rabbits snuck out the door while I was inspecting something or moving my blue moon lights to a different tree or whatever else I was doing, and I was <i>just about to leave</i> to go visit Grandma, so I had to chase them back inside immediately.  I told them they'd get to go play when I got home -- but instead I just sat on the love seat and probably dozed off for an hour or so, only getting up and feeding the cats just before Mom got home.)

I took no knitting photos today, though I got some small amount of knitting done last night.  Mom got a new TV last week, and the new stand came Friday, so Saturday Mom got some minimal help from me in assembling the stand, and then Sunday afternoon she was bugging me about helping her carry TVs around from room to room and move the new stand into place. (She put the old living room TV in her own room, and put the TV from her bedroom into Lauren's old room, which is now the guest bedroom for when Mom babysits Lauren's kids overnight.  She offered me the big TV from her room but I refused it, on the grounds that A) I don't have room for it and B) I very rarely watch TV in my bedroom.  I frankly don't watch a lot of TV in the living room anymore, either.  I'm kind of planning to come home and start marathoning <i>Daredevil</i> when I get home Thursday.)

Lauren showed up for a visit Sunday after Mom and I got done putting the old stand into place. (I'd tried to evade getting dragooned into hauling gear on the grounds that Lauren had been invited over to help.) I ran off to go do my grocery run and Lauren helped Mom do the TV setup.  When I got home Mom was trying to get the TV to do Ultra HD or whatever it was and finally concluded the problem was that it needed a specific content source, not just a setting that could be tweaked.  

I suggested trying it out on <i>The Martian</i>, which is how we discovered the blu ray player had gotten fried along with the cable box in December.  So I need a new blu ray player, but to tide us over until then I started going through recently purchased disks to figure out how to access the ""digital HD copy"" they were throwing in along with the blu ray and DVD.  I now have a VUDU account with ten movies loaded to it, and I showed Mom <i>The Martian</i> last night after we watched John Oliver.

<lj-cut text=""My St Patrick's Day mani"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/St%20Patricks%202016%20-%20Gold.jpg"">

Some very nice decals in that set, and happily the ones I used were pretty close to the same shade as the green I used on the striping-tape nails.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/St%20Patricks%202016%20-%20Gold%202.jpg"">

The thumb looks silly because I got down to the end of the long strip of tape I'd cut off the roll with only two pieces left for that nail, and didn't want to go to the bother of finding the free end of tape and snipping off another section for just a line or two.  And the middle finger got smeared while it was drying.  Aside from that, a fair mani.

Today's is at least neon-bright, though not especially Easter-themed.  I thought about putting on a few chocolate bunny decals but decided to stick to the black and white decals atop the bright polishes I chose.</lj-cut>

And there was that thing where I had someone steal my debit card info in January and had to get a new card and change my info in various accounts and it was all a nuisance but the bank caught the suspicious transactions and flagged them for my attention so the upshot was time wasted but no financial loss.  After all the dubious transactions and bank recredits had gone on through, I had been credited with an additional $11.99 that hadn't actually been taken from my account -- and then in February, a Netflix withdrawal for $11.99 hit (the wrong amount and wrong day of the month for my own Netflix account payment), and I thought, ""Oh, that's it, the bank caught the account someone set up using my card and couldn't cancel it in time to prevent the next bill, so they credited me in advance.""  

Except that today when I did the weekly assessment of my online bank account, I found another $11.99 Netflix debit, and had to call the bank to tell them about it.  The bank's customer service rep suggested that maybe Netflix had called Visa to get the new card info when the old card was cancelled, and set up a stop payment on my account for Netflix for $11.99. (So I'm possibly going to have an issue if I ever cancel the DVD service entirely and just drop down to Netflix streaming.) I got on my Netflix account online to look up customer service and notify them that there's a fraudulent account using my debit card, and I don't know whether the rep I was talking to couldn't look up accounts based on my card number or just couldn't tell me about it, but in any case I've passed the matter along to the Netflix fraud department and the rep told me they've indicated in their records that the Netflix account associated with my correct phone number and billing address is the true cardholder account. (She also blamed the bank for being careless with my account info, declaring it untrue that Netflix might contact Visa for alternate info after a stopped payment.  I would indeed expect to hear from Netflix about a failed debit -- I think I have in the past after changing a debit card -- so that is an interesting point the Netflix rep raised as to how the new debit card was linked to the fraudster's account.)

Okay.  That's me at the end of my abbreviated ""to do"" list for today.  Time to post this and hit the road...</lj-cut>

"event","So Wednesday night on the way to work I ran over something and got a flat tire.  The good news being that if you call AAA at 11:40pm the tow trucks aren't all that busy and you're not sitting around for an hour or two by the roadside.  Still, I was more than half an hour late to work and spent my shift grimly looking forward to wasting a large chunk of my Thursday waiting around at a tire store to spend at least $100 on a replacement.

So Thursday morning I looked up the closest Discount Tire, hit a Whataburger drive-through on the way to get a chicken sandwich for breakfast/dinner, and settled down in the waiting room with my meal and Kindle.  And the difference between going on a Saturday afternoon (like my last tire replacement) and going on a weekday morning is that I was out of there in under an hour.  Special surprise bonus was being told that my warranty covered the tire and I was only charged $18.50 to move the certificate to the new tire.  So I came home, got the strawberries finally planted (the new rosebush went into the ground Wednesday) and passed out.

Today was another day of coming home and falling on my face.  I spent the afternoon lying draped across my bed and then woke up around 4:30 or 5pm.  Visited Grandma, went through the daily ""to do"" list, and turned on the computer because I had a thing or two to deal with.  And now I don't have much naptime left before work, but the flip side is that I don't have a long list of things postponed till tomorrow, either.

"event","Maybe I'll get some planting done tomorrow, if I'm not too tired after work (and the gym) and if the ground is dry enough. (Today when I checked the hole I'd started to dig for the new rosebush, it didn't have standing water anymore but it was still pretty damn muddy.) If not, hopefully we don't get any rain Thursday (or at least not till I can get the rosebush in the ground, and maybe some strawberry roots and oak seedlings as well).

I'm not impressed with the way most of my tulips are performing, but I'm not sure how much may be the fault of the rain causing bulb rot and the crappy soil quality.  I've got a few that look promising but some others seem at risk of falling apart before growing to their full height. (Also, one seems to have gotten partially eaten by a rabbit this morning, but that's my own fault for letting them out to play while I was cleaning their cage.)

On the plus side, I found some tiny leaf buds appearing on the bunny-chewed Peace rose, and the Snowfire rose is probably going to bloom in the next week or so.

<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Fallen%20Photina%202%20Sm.jpg"">

...and here's what it looks like from out in the yard.  We need a chainsaw and we need to deal with it.

Look at that.  Not even full-grown and already falling apart.

The irises collapsed their stalks and so I cut them and brought them in. (They drained the water in the vase and this morning their petals were starting to curl at the edges.  Dangit.  Evidently vases need daily checking or something.)</lj-cut>

I had another appointment with the allergy doc yesterday.  It kind of wrecked my Sunday schedule, trying to get enough sleep but also trying to get things dealt with in advance.  I didn't get the grocery run done till Monday morning -- with just enough time to come home, put things away, and leave for my appointment -- but I still didn't get as much sleep as I needed.  I ran out of gas late in the afternoon -- with the rabbit cage left undealt-with -- and blew off watching the Downton Abbey finale with Mom (which we'd failed to record the previous weekend on its first airing) so I could go to bed early. (And woke up with a major headache at 5:30, which I treated with two naproxen, a caffeine pill, and a lot of water before returning to bed for an hour or two.)

Oh, and the good news was that I got to skip a round of allergy tests.  Apparently round two would have been going back and retesting based on the results of the first round of tests, but I had such strong reactions the first time around they didn't see a need to go back and try again for conclusive results.  This time was the food allergy tests, and the nurse told me I had a couple of positive reactions (though not for <i>what</i>).  The next appointment is the consultation with the doctor to discuss my results.

<lj-cut text=""Minimal knitting"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/WinterFantasy7.jpg"">

Just a few rows away from joining the white yarn and starting the icicle pattern.  That means I can't take this sock to the gym anymore...


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/PurpleTurquoise7.jpg"">

...so I pulled this out of hibernation for gym knitting. (And also for knitting while reading, which I was doing a bit of recently.  The DVR is stacking up.)

Next week I'm taking a couple of days off to go visit Dad.  Which means I'm not going to be doing anything about the DVR backlog while I'm gone, but at least I'll get some time to work on the Sweet Heart socks and the icicle stockings.</lj-cut>

So doing the rabbit cage and vacuuming this morning got me to a late start, and then I took time to eat lunch and get things ready for tonight before finally turning on the computer.  But at least I got myself ready for bed before finishing my mani, which has had some time for the final layers to dry while I've been typing up this entry...

<lj-cut text=""Quick and lazy"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/St%20Patricks%202016%20-%20Silver.jpg"">

That decal on my middle finger didn't adhere at all well -- stuck up around the edges instead of lying flat, and then got snagged and pulled off on Saturday or Sunday.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/St%20Patricks%202016%20-%20Silver%202.jpg"">

Decals are really simple, and I've been letting myself get lazy with my manicures of late.  So today I made a point of locking myself in to doing some striping tape work to add some green to my coppery basecoat. (I cheated a little bit, using shamrocks and four-leaf-clover decals on five fingers.) And next week will be my Easter mani, which means more striping tape is almost mandatory for my customary Easter egg mani.</lj-cut>

The good news is that after I finish my Tuesday stuff next week I'll be leaving for Dad's, rather than taking a brief nap and then going to work.  The bad news is the inherent temptation to let my Tuesday routine run <i>really</i> late because I won't have work that night.  Need to stay on top of the Monday ""to do"" list next week! (Need to retrain myself to stop letting the last few items on the list run over to Tuesday.  Need to get some more done on Sundays, or do better at coming home and catching up on sleep Sunday afternoons...)</lj-cut>

"event","It's been raining all week, so I haven't been able to get the newest rosebush into the ground yet.  Tomorrow, maybe.  Also, I googled strawberry planting, and if I'd known how fiddly they are, I wouldn't have been so cavalier about tossing the bag of rootlets into my grocery cart.  I had been vaguely hoping to plant the rose today, but I spent the afternoon reading and now it's late.  Tomorrow, maybe.  If I'm really feeling perky when I get home, I might give the flowerbeds another weeding as well. (I wasn't especially thorough the first time around, choosing to focus on ripping away the bulk of the tall weeds and leaving smaller bits behind.  And now there are unwanted shoots coming back up.)

At some point between me leaving for work the night before last and Mom getting up yesterday morning, the dead tree by the back patio collapsed under its own weight. (Those red-tipped photinas are crap.  I think most if not all of the trees in the backyard that had branches dying and rotting and leaning against other trees or sagging to the ground were photinas.) Mom had been making noises about acquiring a chainsaw to cut that tree down, so now instead we need one to cut the fallen tree into chunks that we can haul to the front yard for trash pickup.  And then we need to attack the remainder of the dead trees along the side and back fences -- the ones I wasn't able to uproot singlehandedly during my earlier pruning sessions because they were so rotted at the roots.

More tulips are coming up.  I didn't realize they open near the ground and only then grow a stalk raising the flower into the air. (Either that, or all my tulips are defective.) Two irises have bloomed.  Several of the full-sized rosebushes are producing flowerbuds, and the mini-roses are opening.  Five stargazer lilies have sprouted, as has the bonus daylily that was thrown into the package with all the tulip bulbs.  I've finally started the compost heap I should have begun last fall. (It seems oak leaves make fine compost all by themselves, and excellent mulch before they decay, which may explain why the neglected rosebush by the side of the house under the oak tree has done so well over the years.)

"event","So I had quite a list of things that I wanted to do with my Sunday, and then Mom sprang on me a few days in advance that there was going to be a family gathering on Sunday because of Grandma's 91st birthday being on Monday, and <i>then</i> I wound up putting in three hours of overtime Sunday morning, and the upshot was that I got home (from work and then the gym) just in time to turn around and leave for the party.  I got home absolutely freaking exhausted (due to not having gotten enough sleep on Saturday, among other reasons) and slept late Monday morning and spent the day catching up on stuff.

Most of the planned Sunday stuff was gardening-related and can be postponed, but I made a special point of at least dragging the brush pile from last week's back yard pruning to the front yard for the next large-item pickup.  Because I wanted to be able to let the bunnies out to play in the yard when I was cleaning the rabbit cage later.  Only I didn't get around to the rabbit cage on Monday -- I was so very late getting up and running, and then out the door to make my grocery run, and it was getting dark by the time I got home and started my laundry and did the dishes, so I decided to let the rabbit cage slide till today.

And then this morning when I got up there was an actual thunderstorm in progress, which I used as an excuse to lie around reading after breakfast, since I couldn't (well, <i>wouldn't</i>) do anything involving going outside to dump stuff, and I probably shouldn't get started on the computer stuff with lightning nearby, either.  The rain stopped, I finished my book, and then I got the rabbit cage cleaned and the vacuuming done.  And then it was 5pm and I made a point of getting completely ready for bed, since I clearly had so little time left to get on the computer with and wanted to have absolutely everything else out of the way first.

<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Ballyronan5.jpg"">

But I <i>have</i> been putting a few repeats onto this with my visits to Grandma, and there's visible progress. (Especially since it's been a few weeks since my last photo.)

Also I've been working on the blue stocking at the gym, but not really a spectacular amount since last week's photo.</lj-cut>

The gardening has been more fun since spring kicked in and now I can admire the new growth on the rosebushes and watch the new plants coming up.  I haven't entirely given up on the Peace rose yet, but I was planning on getting a deep red rose next <i>anyway</i>, so I bought a <a href=""http://www.heirloomroses.com/roses/hybrid-tea-roses/mr-lincoln.html"">Mr Lincoln</a> during Monday's grocery run.  And also a package of strawberry rootlets or whatever to plant in the bed in the backyard, since I wasn't really intending to get into food production but what the hell, the package was so cheap.  So I'm hoping to get the bush and the strawberries into the ground in the next few days, depending on how exhausted I am getting home from work and how much it rains over the next days. (Supposed to be raining all week.) 

I also need to do some weeding in the various flowerbeds -- I ripped up the worst of the weeds in the neglected beds last week, so I could check for sprouting tulips (which I found), but I need to get in there a little more carefully, and maybe loosen up the soil a bit with a gardening fork or something. (If I had any compost to work with, I'd be putting it into the flowerbeds.  Next spring.)

The tulips are coming up all over, now -- at least a dozen sprouts, and some starting to open and show off the flower within.  I think at least one of the packages was specifically a selection of bulbs meant to bloom at various points in the spring so as to keep the display going for the entire season, so I'm not worrying too much about getting such a fractional result for the dozens of bulbs I planted.

Two of Mom's irises developed to the point of producing a flower, and one of them opened <i>today</i>. (The morning inspection of the plantings in the front and back has become a daily pleasure.  Today it was an afternoon inspection because of the morning rains.) I see four sprouts where I planted the stargazer lilies Mom bought -- I think there was a fifth one in the package, but given the fourth only appeared in the last few days, I haven't given up on it.  I'm looking forward to picking out a lot of perennial bulbs this fall...

<lj-cut text=""Spring growth"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Tulip%20bud%20Sm.jpg"">

Tulip beginning to open.  I'm a little surprised -- I would have expected the stalks to grow up first and then the buds to grow and open.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Iris%20Sm.jpg"">

New-blooming iris, planted however many years ago.  How's that for delayed gratification?


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Mini%20rosebuds%20and%20oak%20seedlings%20Sm.jpg"">

We're about to have an outbreak of wee roses.  And in the pot on the lower right, one taller oak seedling and one newer smaller one. (Getting one or both of them planted was another of the things I wanted to get done Sunday but didn't.  Partly because it's going to involve clearing a circle around where I put the seedling, to turn into a round flowerbed to fill with bulbs for the years while the oak is growing into a young tree.)</lj-cut>

I just remembered I wanted to make a special point of checking on the motion-detector light I stuck on the front porch yesterday evening, since it's had today to charge up (at least during the sunny afternoon) and it's dark out now.  I thought I might have forgotten to use the key pin to turn it on and knew I wouldn't have time to fiddle with it tonight on the way out the door to work (and might well have forgotten it needed doing by tomorrow).  And yes, I had indeed forgotten to turn it on -- it went on nice and bright as soon as I stuck the key into the pinhole, so now I've got a light to use when I'm locking the door behind me on the way to work. (Though I'm in the habit of sticking the key into the door while I'm still standing in the lighted entryway, before exiting the house and pulling the door closed behind me.  But that does me no good if I have to go back inside for something I forgot, or if I'm going to the gym or the grocery store in the wee hours on my night off.)

<lj-cut text=""Springtime nails"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Spring%20Leaves.jpg"">

The lighter green was very sparkly and the deeper green was a handsome emerald.  With the gold decals it also looked fairly Christmasy, which I may keep in mind for next December.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Spring%20Leaves%202.jpg"">

I was kind of thinking of repeating the sun decal on the thumb for today's mani, but I had so little time I only used decals of the peel-and-stick variety, none that required soaking off the card.

New pedicure in teal glitter.  I was kind of planning on using the same teal polish for today's mani, with gold details added with striping tape, but first I had three nails break off on Monday and wound up having to trim them all short, and then I had absolutely no time to do anything fancier than glitter topcoat and decals.  And I went for emerald green instead of teal, with silver decals instead of gold.  Looks pretty good, though.</lj-cut>

And this was the last thing on the ""to do"" list, thankfully -- posting this entry.  Not a lot of time for a nap before work, but at least I don't have any of today's list left over to deal with tomorrow, like I was afraid of having happen...</lj-cut>

"event","So I put in three hours of overtime at work this morning, hit the gym on the way home, and then had no time to do much more than change my shirt and hit the bathroom before leaving for Grandma's birthday party.

She turns ninety-one tomorrow, we had a big family party today, and Mom and I just got home a few minutes ago.  I'm freaking exhausted.  Everything I needed to do today is going to be pushed to tomorrow, as if my Mondays weren't busy enough.  And I need to go tend the bunnies and brush my teeth before I pass out right here, light still on and phone in hand.

"event","Last week was kind of a bust, in that I barely managed to even deal with the items on the ""to do"" list (in fact, I never made it over to the nursing home to visit Grandma, or posted a weekend journal entry) and didn't do much of any knitting.  I was coming home and passing out but only for a few hours (not nearly enough sleep), or getting things out of the way so I <i>could</i> take a six-hour nap and then not falling asleep when I should have.  So, a very listless week.

The newest rosebush paid the price for my exhaustion, since I didn't plant it the first morning I had the chance, and then that night it was going to be down in the 30s again and when I brought the mini-roses in their pots inside I went ahead and brought in the new rosebush as well.  I left it sitting on the kitchen floor instead of putting it up on the table because the package was leaking a bit after each watering.  And then the next morning when I got home from work, I freed the bunnies, went to my room to set out fresh clothes for that night, and wound up dozing off for an hour or two.  Which turned out to be long enough for <i>somebunny</i> (I'm going to go ahead and assume it was Amelia) to attack the rosebush sitting in the kitchen and strip the outer bark off two of the only three canes it had.  I planted the rose early that afternoon.  The pot turned out to be biodegradable and collapsed when I pulled it out of the plastic outer wrapping, before I could get the bush set into its new hole with the potting soil still packed around its roots, so it turned into an accidental repeat of the bare root planting of a few weeks ago.  Only the first bare root rose I planted A) got soaked for a day and a night before planting and B) wasn't attacked by a rabbit, which is why it's now covered with new leaves.  I suspect the new Peace rose is doomed -- at least that's a rose type that they tend to sell locally, so a replacement should be easy enough to acquire without having to resort to mail order.

In slightly happier gardening news, I spotted a few new shoots in the areas where I planted tulip bulbs in January.  One in the front yard and one in the back near the daffodils.  I hope those aren't the only two that come up... (Also, the surprise bonus daylily that came with the tulip order and got stuck in between the Snowfire and Perfume Delight in the front is displaying a wee sprout.)

And yesterday when I let the bunnies out to play in the yard, Amelia got horsey about coming back inside afterwards, so I think I'm not going to allow them out again until I've taken the time to attack the saplings along the back fence with the two-handled pruner.  The thicket along the side fence is now cleared out to the point where I can chase a rabbit through it with minimal difficulty, but yesterday she found a tangle at the back where she can lurk and I can't reach her. (Also I have to do some weeding in three flowerbeds.  The one in the front that <i>doesn't</i> have rosebushes planted in it has so many weeds I can't tell if any bulbs are coming up or not.  And I planted not just tulips in that bed but the package of lilies Mom bought as well.)

I am still waiting on the strand of purple flower-shaped lights to arrive, and on my most recent paycheck I ordered a few lanterns for the backyard as well.  Another few strands and lanterns and it'll be a really nice view for when we're sitting in the living room (or standing in the kitchen) at night.  I need to take a photo at some point, but it's still a work in progress. (As for the front yard, I ordered another really bright motion-detector light like the one on the back patio to go on the front doorstep for when I'm trying to lock or unlock the door.  Gave up on really fancy decor, though there might eventually be a few windspinners or something pretty dangling from the roofline.  Oh, and there's that lamppost by the street that needs an actual working light to go on top.)

<lj-cut text=""Only a little knitting"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/WinterFantasy6.jpg"">

Working on this at the gym, and I'm creeping my way up through the calf increases.  Definitely need to check which row I need to be adding the white yarn and starting to work the icicle design.

Also, I'm working the Ballyronan cowl, but this last week or two it's only been while I've been visiting Grandma and only about a pattern repeat each time.  Nothing worth taking a photo of.</lj-cut>

So Mom's tax refund came in a day or two ago and she transferred $200 to me (for recent feline veterinary expenses) and I immediately moved it to the credit card with the larger balance.  And today I discovered that I'm probably about to get a bill in the mail from the allergist for my recent testing, which was only the first round of several.  The next set of tests comes in a week or two, ah ha hah.  And I've got a $1500 deductible on my insurance, it turns out, which is more than I had to deal with last year or the year before and is probably why I keep being <i>surprised</i> by these bills in the mail.  So <i>this</i> is why the balance on the credit card keeps going up and up, and why I'm just sort of resigned to putting in some overtime where I can get it and in the meantime holding on another few years until the car is paid off and frees up a few hundred dollars each month.

In related news, I did indeed take the time to leave the house early this afternoon and go vote in our primary.

<lj-cut text=""Blue ombre"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Blue%20Silver.jpg"">

A butterfly decal because I'd really wanted a butterfly-wing mani, but first I was too lazy and/or out of time to look up how to do a proper one (as seen in <a href=""http://alldaychic.com/butterfly-wings-nail-art/"">this tutorial</a>), and second I was disappointed by the polish I was planning my manicure around, which turned out to be a mere glittery topcoat. (<a href=""http://lindseyrivait.com/lacquer/2013/03/ozotic-duochrome-butterfly-manicure/"">This polish</a> is very close to what I hoped I was buying, coincidentally enough shown in a butterfly-wing mani.  No, I hadn't seen this blog post when I had the idea -- the disappointing polish I bought is a color <i>called</i> ""Butterfly Wings,"" hence the inspiration.)

<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Blue%20Silver%202.jpg"">

This was a very nice ombre, though -- pale blue leading into medium blue, with a swish of midnight blue at the very tips.  And the right thumb was gorgeous before the rose decal smeared away from the tip. (There are also roses on the ring and index finger, though it was really hard to get a light that showed them well.)

This week's mani is another decals-over-ombre, though at least this week I went with gold instead of silver.  Spring green shading into leaf green at the tips, with a definite leaves-and-flowers motif for the decals, and a sun on the right thumb.  Springtime!</lj-cut>

Another reason I didn't get much done over the weekend was down to me being in the midst of a Vorkosigan reread, since a new book in the series came out recently.  I reread the last three and then found myself going back and starting from the beginning.  So Sunday I came home from the gym and spent the day reading instead of doing anything useful like making my grocery run. (Though also I was hiding in my room because Mom had been babysitting overnight so my sister and her husband could take the night off and she could have a birthday dinner, and the kids weren't collected till Sunday afternoon.) Then I woke up shortly after midnight Sunday night/Monday morning and wound up reading <i>all damned morning</i> instead of getting up and doing anything that needed doing, until I finished the book and discovered I didn't have the next one in Kindle format yet.  So Monday I got off to a late start on the ""to do"" list and yet had been up since the wee hours, and it was a damned good thing I got through everything but the vacuuming and getting my nails ready for today's mani before running out of steam and zonking out on the couch.  Mom got home and I roused for just long enough to share a pizza with her, before getting myself into bed. (No, wait, I got the bunnies tended and then fell asleep in my room for a few hours before getting up to go brush my teeth.)

So today I got off to another slow start, but at least I caught up on sleep last night and now I'm down to the last item on my ""to do"" list.  I need to go fill my fruit cup for tonight and get something to eat, and then it's time to get ready for bed...</lj-cut>

"event","Well, Mom did her tax return and is getting enough money back that she's giving me $200 towards what I recently spent on various cats' vet expenses.  So that's a good thing.  And on my grocery run (which I did this morning because I was exhausted Sunday and it was the one thing on the list I didn't deal with yesterday) I got a $5 bouquet of tulips because I'm worrying about the bulbs I planted and was bound and determined to have <i>some</i> tulips this spring. (I also got around to making a few new journal icons, including this one.)

<lj-cut text=""Tulips"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Tulip%20Bouquet%20Sm.jpg"">

I have many skills, but flower arrangement isn't among them. (Though if I turn out to be halfway sucessful at gardening, I should definitely make a point of learning a bit.) Shortly after taking this photo, I went and got a long twist tie I'd seen lying about loose and made a big loop around the bouquet to help encourage the bundled tulips to stand up straighter.  So it looks slightly better now.</lj-cut>

I have done so little knitting over the past week I didn't bother taking any photos of it today.  It's been a week of coming home and falling asleep partway through the ""to do"" list.

The gardening is going much better.  All the rosebushes in the ground are showing new growth -- mostly little red leaves, though the Blue Girl is still at the budding stage (and lost a few leafbuds yesterday when I let the rabbits play in the backyard and Amelia insisted on taking a nibble -- I've been watching her for signs of illness, since I'd sprayed the roses for black spot on Sunday) and the new Ebb Tide has a wee spriglet of green leaves along with its various buds.  The mini roses are covered in new growth and the most vigorous pair has half a dozen rosebuds that are likely to be blooming in the next week or two.  One of my other impulse buys this morning was a Peace rosebush, because I knew I was going to get one eventually and it was only $7.84.  So it's sitting on the back patio getting rained on, and in a day or two when the rain stops and the ground is less muddy I'll plant it over by the Ebb Tide in the front flowerbed.

In bulb news, no sign of the tulips coming up, which is part of why I bought a bouquet.  But also, the irises that Mom planted years ago that only just sent up leaf-spikes are still showing no signs of flowers, and the daffodils in the back yard came up only leaves, no blooms.  And daffodils are being seen in the neighborhood (including in our next-door neighbor's yard), so these are definitely overdue for digging up and replanting.  But I got a bottle of liquid fertilizer this morning, and used most of it on the daffodils in the hopes of getting one or two flowers before I dig the bulbs up this summer. (The rest of the liquid fertilizer is for the amaryllis bulbs.  I'm going to go ahead and try to get them to bloom again next winter, possible fungal infection or not.  Since I already <i>have</i> the bulbs and pots, it'll cost me little but fresh soil and effort to make the attempt.)

Another thing I did yesterday was taking the strands of solar lights that arrived in yesterday's mail and getting them out into the trees.  The multicolor lotuses are lovely and bright, the multicolor icicles are faint (I need to try moving their solar cell to a better location to see if they just need more power, and if that doesn't work move them to a closer tree), and the cool white crescent moons look good but I want to add some more single-color strands (or lanterns) so they don't stand out so much as a contrast to the three multicolor strands.  There's a strand of purple flowers that was being shipped separately, so there's a start on the single-color lights.  I can see spots in the trees for another couple of strands, but I think next I'm going to get another few lanterns to hang from branches.  <a href=""http://smile.amazon.com/Seasonal-Charm-Solar-Lantern-Handle/dp/B00DBAUN7Q/ref=sr_1_4?s=lawn-garden&srs=6681924011&ie=UTF8&qid=1456269364&sr=1-4"">This lantern</a> that I have hanging is lovely and I'd love a similar design in different colors but most of what I'm seeing is more green in different metalwork patterns.  But I'm going to want some other colors, too.

Also, despite all the tree-trimming I did, more needs to be done.  Last week I found some more branches so dead I could yank them loose without needing a saw -- including a bit of actual uprooting of small rotted trees -- so there's another brush pile in front of the house needing hauling.  And there's another bit in the corner where there's one dying tree entangling another that's going to require a saw to take off at least the most offending branch, even if we don't cut the bad tree down this year.  And I've done nothing at all about the tangle along the back fence.  The crape myrtle in the back corner is tall and lovely and I'm inclined to leave it be, but there's another tangle of collapsing branches and unwelcome saplings that I should attack with the two-handled shears in the next few weeks.

And I did a few things to make Mom happy this morning.  First I bought another ten stake lights to match the ones I already got for the front walkway, because she wanted some to outline the front flowerbeds and I wanted to make sure they were all a matched set.  And then I took the two-handled shears to a spot on the oak tree in the sideyard where Mom was complaining about a thick cluster of small branches springing out from the site where a limb was sawn off years ago.  I can see that they would cause a mowing problem if they were allowed to keep growing -- they were coming out at chest height.  So that was done this morning, and that's why I didn't turn on the computer until past noon.

No movies watched in the past week, not even one of the vampire movies I have sitting around.  I need to get some stuff off the DVR this week...

<lj-cut text=""Post-Valentine's mani"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Post-Valentines%202016.jpg"">

The decal on the ring finger went on early in the process, before I decided on silver for the rest of the fingers.  Aside from the black-and-white-and-silver tips that I decided to use on a couple of fingers.  Those tips were lovely but I had a hard time getting them placed just right -- should have gone a bit over the tips of my fingers and filed them to fit, instead of having a little gap of maroon just past the white band. (I used a smidgen of white polish to fill in the gaps at the very tips on those two fingers, but it didn't blend in well and chipped away really fast.)


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Post-Valentines%202016%202.jpg"">

Got the tip crooked on the index finger on this hand, and the ring finger decal went on lopsided as well.  I had similar problems placing the decals on the right hand today -- I'm using the right hand to pull the decal off the card with the tweezers, and then having to switch hands to hold the tweezers with the left and suddenly I'm holding the decal in a <i>really</i> inconvenient spot for placing it on my right hand.

Today's mani was inspired by a bottle of polish that looked gorgeous in the bottle but went on nearly transparent, so I had to scrap my original butterfly-wings plan. (Going to have to do a proper butterfly wings mani at some point in the future, but not this week.) Instead it's a blue gradient with another round of silver decals on top.</lj-cut>

And, so.  I have a few tabs to finish reading and close, but aside from that I'm at the end of the ""to do"" list for today.  Now I just need to wind things up, get something to eat, feed the cats, and head for bed...</lj-cut>

"event","This week has involved several days in a row of coming home and falling asleep partway through the list of things I needed to deal with before work that night.  Very little knitting done, no movies watched, but at least I was well-rested.  Up until today, anyway, when I was too tired to get things done when I got home but couldn't fall asleep early in the afternoon when I tried to.  And then Mom woke me up to talk about Grandma (going into hospice care because she's not eating or drinking enough, though Mom says she may recover somewhat with the extra nursing care -- I think Mom is being deludedly optimistic), and then again to drive her to Firestone to pick up her car after having it fixed.  

I have just enough time left for a little nap before work -- and given how much work was left this morning when I left, there's guaranteed overtime in the morning. (Which will be eventually lucrative but right now is exhausting, and means I can't expect to get much done with my day tomorrow after work and the gym.  I'm expecting to collapse once I'm home.)

There was a departmental meeting a night or two back.  I tend to start dozing off during those as I'm just sitting there not actively doing anything -- especially since they like holding them at 4am when I'm at my most likely to be struggling to stay awake, so I miss a lot of what gets said. (Not least because I'm sitting under an air vent providing white noise drowning out the supervisors' voices.) But I think we were being vaguely promised actual raises next month instead of the bullshit pittances we usually get after our annual reviews in March.  Plus the profitsharing bonus, which I'm expecting to mainly just dump on the credit card that's been running up in recent months with vet bills and car maintenance and other crap.

More pay would definitely be nice.

"event","So I've spent the bulk of the weekend catching up on sleep, which has been good for me but hasn't led to much knitting-related progress.

I wanted to be especially sure to get the grocery run taken care of on Sunday afternoon or evening because of the cats' vet appointment on Monday.  Instead I lay down on the couch Sunday afternoon, napped till evening, went to my room to plug my phone in, and wound up lying on my bed and sleeping for another few hours.  Got up and did my grocery run around 6am, getting an insane amount of 50%-off Valentine's candy (as I told Mom, I need to eat a lot of salads in the coming week).  Then I ran through my Monday routine with a minimum of wasted time because of that 2:20 appointment to get to.

Dizzy's foot has healed very well indeed from the abscess -- the vet could barely find the original puncture, and she'd been the one to inspect it when I brought him in the weekend before last.  But he has a molar that she told me is either broken off (and hence needing removal) or else in the process of being reabsorbed by his gums (and hence something we can ignore).  He's already reabsorbed a molar on the other side of his jaw.  She said in a month or so we'll know if I need to bring him in to have it removed.

Choo-Choo has been showing some breathing difficulties of late.  The vet wants me to put him on some allergy medication and bring him back in if he still isn't showing signs of improvement in a week. (I suspect that in a week I still won't have tracked down and purchased the drug the vet wants me to try him out on.)

Squeaky has a mass in his mouth and another in his abdomen.  The vet says the big concern with lymphoma is something blocking his gut, so we need to keep an eye on him and make sure he's still eating and drinking well -- and not vomiting it up afterwards, and using the litter box on a regular schedule.  This is really hard to keep track of -- Mom and I aren't always even able to stand over the cats for five minutes enforcing the ""one cat, one plate,"" rule, which is part of why Squeaky has gotten so thin.  If we find vomit we have no idea which cat it's from, and we have no idea which cat did what in the litter boxes. (Or outside, for that matter.) The vet made noises about putting Squeaky on a steroid to buy him some time.  She didn't send me home with a bottle of the medicine, so I don't know if I'm supposed to go buy it off the shelf somewhere (like with the antihistamine she wants me to give Chooch) or if she'll call me back in a few days to follow up on things. (It may be in the medical reports on the three cats I was e-mailed afterwards.  They were attached files so I haven't opened them to look at them.)

I got home from the vet's around 3:30 and had all the time I needed to vacuum, visit Grandma, and start getting my nails ready for today's manicure.  So instead I had a nap on the couch and woke up around 6:30.  I got up and fed the cats, then did the vacuuming a bit after Mom got home from work, and afterwards did the fiddling with my nails (including giving myself a pedicure) while watching TV with Mom.

So this morning at least I didn't have to vacuum when I got up.  I wound up deciding to go see Grandma early, before getting on the computer, so I could knit for a while without risking damaging a fresh manicure and so I wouldn't have to try to break things off early on the computer to go see her.  Added benefit of going early was finding Grandma parked in her wheelchair by the nurses' station instead of in her bed. (Her new roommate is prone to asking me to run errands for her when I come to see Grandma.)

<lj-cut text=""Not a lot of knitting this week"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/SweetHeart10.jpg"">

I think I got one day of working on this last week, plus a few more rows last night after I finished filing my nails.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Ballyronan4.jpg"">

A few pattern repeats on this over the last few days.  I took it to the animal clinic yesterday, and to see Grandma this morning.

Two gym sessions and a movie -- and I need to go see <i>Deadpool</i> this week, so that should be even more progress on this sock.</lj-cut>

The roses are doing well -- a bright pink bloom on one mini, with the pair of plants in another pot shooting up gleefully and producing more bitsy rosebuds.  As for the full-sized bushes, the Snowfire (hard hit and denuded by black spot in the fall) and the Heirloom are covered in new red leaves, as is the nameless pink rose in the sideyard.  The Blue Girl and the Perfume Delight are budding out to a lesser degree.  The new Ebb Tide is probably going to be sinking roots for a while, but it had one little sprig of leaves remaining on the bare canes, and one bud that's producing tiny leaves now.  We've had a few warm days of proto-spring (though tonight will be chilly) and the roses are kicking into gear.

I moved the solar sensor for the strand of icicle lights in the backyard from its stake in the ground to the fork of a nearby tree.  This is because this morning I deliberately let the bunnies out to play in the backyard for the second time (the first being last week while I was cleaning their cage) and I wanted that wire up out of their reach.  I'll probably have to adjust the placement when the trees have regained their leaves.

I also ordered a few more strands of solar lights for the trees in the backyard, having tested the effect with the initial strand.  It's pretty, it illuminates for hours, but by itself it looks pathetic.  Another three or four strands and a few lanterns should make the yard into something enchanting at night.

And then we start adding a few things to the front yard.  Which one might consider a higher priority, except that we can <i>see</i> the backyard from the living room and the kitchen, while we only see the front yard when passing through it to get to my car or the mailbox.  Yesterday morning at Wal-Mart I got a few really cheap stake lights for the front walkway and placed them after I'd put my groceries away.  Tonight is when I verify that they still provide enough illumination at 11:30pm to at least show me where the ground is so I'm not tripping over the step and the break in the concrete.  I'm thinking of getting something prettier to hang from the roof of the porch and provide a bit of light for getting my key into the door.  And also, we want some wind spinners, for front yard and back as well.

<lj-cut text=""Meanwhile, my nails"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Valentine-Mardi%20Gras%202016.jpg"">

The index finger looks a bit blunt-tipped because I actually broke off a tiny bit of the nail after I had the silver base coat done but before I added the pink and purple detailing.  I filed it smoothish but didn't want to risk the polish integrity in really reshaping the nail.  And I broke quite a few nails last week, up until yesterday afternoon, so last night was about not just removing the old polish but trimming the ends and filing them all into shape.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Valentine-Mardi%20Gras%202016%202.jpg"">

Anyway, so this mani was a combo for Mardi Gras and Valentine's.  So pink and the heart glitter were for Valentine's, and the base color was silver instead of white and the other detail color was purple for Mardi Gras.  Little bit of smudging on the left pinky and the tip of the right thumb, but I didn't notice either till a day or two later. (I was doing the art layers very late indeed last Tuesday.)

Today is sort of post-Valentine's, deep maroon with decals.  I was originally thinking black decals but I remembered a really cool set of tips I'd gotten that were white with black and silver detailing, and I wound up using a couple of those and then silver decals on most of the other fingers.  My only quibble is that this is a really dark color to have on a week when my nails are so short -- aside from that, I'm very satisfied with my manicure.</lj-cut>

And my maroon-and-silver nails are reminding me that I have <i>two</i> vampire movies waiting to be seen.  <i>What We Do in the Shadows</i> is taking up space on the DVR, and <i>Only Lovers Left Alive</i> is a Netflix disk lying on my desk.  Maybe I'll take care of one or even both of those in the coming week.  I can go see <i>Deadpool</i> in a week or two...

And I can go fix something to eat now, since my nails have had ample time for the final round of topcoat to dry.  This is it for my ""to do"" list -- post this journal entry and I'm done.</lj-cut>

"event","The purple rosebush I've been waiting eagerly for arrived on Wednesday -- fairly late in the afternoon, after a long and tiring day, so I didn't have time to do much more than look for a basin in which to give the entire plant a 24-hour immersion, discover the kitchen bucket could only handle the roots, and put the plant in my bathtub to soak.  

I was running late when I got up and running that night, so when I came into the bathroom and discovered the tub had entirely drained itself while I was sleeping and the rosebush was lying there on its side drying out instead of hydrating, I only had time to go grab the kitchen bucket and set the rose in it to at least keep the roots wet while I was at work.

When I got home on Thursday morning, I went on a more thorough search for a basin, and discovered a couple of drink coolers in the garden shed.  The smaller cooler looked to be a good size, so I rinsed it out with the hose and started it filling. (The care instructions for the bare root rose <i>said</i> to throw in a capful of household bleach in the soak water to prevent bacterial growth, so I gladly added a splash of bleach as well.) The rose was a perfect fit, so I finished filling the cooler, closed the lid, and went to go see <i>Pride & Prejudice and Zombies</i> (which was exactly the movie you were expecting it to be based on the title).

Friday I came home tired and had an almost-nap of an hour or two before getting the new rose safely planted in the front flowerbed.  The spot I'd picked for it turned out to have some sort of water valve or some other damn thing hiding in a sunken receptacle, so I had to move it over by a foot.  The rosebush pattern in the flowerbed is going to wind up being somewhat crooked...

Anyway.  So the rose is planted and I put some fertilizer on the other rosebushes in that front bed while I was at it.  Today when I finally got home from work I threw some fertilizer on the bushes in the backyard as well (especially the Blue Girl, which just isn't trying), and then realized it might be good to give a dose to the neglected bush in the sideyard, which has responded to its vigorous repeat pruning by covering itself in new red leaves.  

Meanwhile, Mom had taken her car to Firestone to have it looked at and needed a ride home, and I took long enough finishing up with roses and refilling pets' water bowls before following her out the door that she tried calling me to ask me where I was.  I gave her a ride home, went to visit Grandma early to make sure I wouldn't fall asleep without doing so (like I did Friday after planting my rosebush), and came home and spent about seven hours asleep on the couch, aside from a few interruptions.  

I had the repeated thought that I should set an alarm on my phone for around 8pm to make sure I didn't wake up with no time left to take care of everything that needed doing before work tonight, but was sure I'd be woken up around then by Mom even if I didn't naturally wake up myself.  As it happened, it was past 9pm when Mom came home from running various errands to turn on the living room TV, but I've had enough time to do dishes and shower and get dressed for work and even quickly type up this entry.  Now I'm right on schedule for taking my evening pills, putting my socks and shoes on, and getting ready to head out the door...

"event","Dizzy was limping last week -- first Mom told me he was, then I noticed it myself, and then Saturday morning when I got home from work and fed the cats he didn't want to get down off the couch and come into the kitchen.  His left front paw was visibly swollen and one of his claws was oozing, so I called the animal clinic and got him an 11am appointment.  So he got an antibiotic shot to last him the week, a shot of kitty morphine, and had his abscess irrigated.  And I lost an hour and a half of my Saturday and paid $179.  But anyway.  He's feeling much better now. (And I still have to bring him in on Monday with his brothers for the annual checkup and shots, since the vet didn't want to vaccinate him while he was running a slight fever, and anyway she wanted to be able to recheck his foot.)

I made noises to Mom about maybe asking to kick over a few hundred towards this latest vet visit and the one that's coming up next week, out of her tax refund, and she made noises back about having had various unexpected expenses of her own. (But seriously.  The vet, the tax non-refund, the broken phone replacement, the last time I took my car in for an oil change and wound up having some other service thing done, and the extra $400-something I got billed after my first visit to the allergy doc.  I've just kind of given up all hope of getting out from under until my car is paid off.)

In other news, the red amaryllis bloomed and withered, and the red-and-white one is now opening its third bloom out of four.

<lj-cut text=""Amaryllis in bloom"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Amaryllis%20Sm.jpg"">

I took a photo to send to my aunt on Facebook, since she (or possibly Dad) gave it to me.</lj-cut>

One of the things I did yesterday when I should have been cleaning the rabbit cage was to troubleshoot the big motion-detector solar light I'd stuck on the side of the house a few days beforehand.  The power button is reached by sticking a little metal pin into a hole (like resetting my old MP3 player) and the only way to tell you've got it on correctly is to cover the solar panel and see if the light comes on, so it's a source of frequent complaints in Amazon reviews regarding the product.  I got the metal pin and poked the power button again, but my main suspicion was that I'd placed it under an overhang and the solar cell wasn't being exposed to light, so I also moved it to a different wall of the house.  And then I got the strand of solar-powered lights I'd bought and strung them in one of the trees along the side fence.

Last night when I was feeding the cats I glanced out the window and saw the strand of lights happily glowing.  And when I went outside for a closer look, the motion-detector light came on as soon as I stepped out the door, and stayed on for several minutes.  Success!

Now I want at least another two or three strands of lights and a few hanging lanterns for the backyard.  But I think a set of stake lights for the front walk should be my next priority.

Fiddling with my broken phone -- more to the point, getting the old MP3 player up and functioning, and making sure the Nexus tablet could do what I needed to fill the gap till I got my new phone, and then setting up the new phone -- ate too much of my free time on Wednesday and Thursday on into Friday.  

Happily, Android devices like to talk to each other, so I was able to get the old broken phone to copy over my various accounts to the new one.  Unfortunately I couldn't get the copy feature to work to get <i>everything</i> copied over directly (each phone kept periodically plaintively asking me if I was sure I had the other phone up and going in the correct mode), but the backup file I'd made from the old phone and copied over to my desktop worked just fine on the new phone.  The only things I seemed to be missing were A) playlists for the music app (possibly because I'd left the music files out of the backup since the phone wouldn't have had enough room for the backup file otherwise -- I just directly copied the music folder itself to my desktop), B) downloaded podcasts for the podcast app (and since at least it remembered which podcasts I'm subscribed to, I chose to count my blessings and do a lot of redownloading), and C) photos I'd uploaded myself to the jigsaw puzzle app (many of which should be still in the Google Photos app anyway, though probably a lot fewer of them since I went through that a week or two back and deleted a bunch of images to save space, dammit).  Most importantly, my task list managing app worked just fine and had the current lists, not the ones dating back to last October that are what my tablet keeps showing. (That's a glitch mentioned in the notes regarding an update on the app, but it may be on Google's end and not the app's fault.)

So, not a lot of knitting done last week:

<lj-cut text=""Some minimal accomplishments"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/SweetHeart9.jpg"">

No chance of it being finished in time for Valentine's -- especially if I go see a movie or two this week.  But I think this gets to be the top priority for the rest of the month (or until I finish it, whichever comes first.)


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/WinterFantasy4.jpg"">

Since this is my gym knitting <i>and</i> will be my theater knitting for <i>Deadpool</i> (and I'd like to see <i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</i>, too), this is going to be showing some progress next week.  I'm nearly to the calf increases!</lj-cut>

And then Sunday I came home from work and spent all day reading the most recent Vorkosigan book, having reread the last two before it in the days beforehand.  I spent the day doing nothing but read, until I passed out lying in my bed with my Kindle.  I got up and did things I should have done earlier (like showering and making my grocery run) and was up and running well before my alarm was set to go off.

I would not normally have an alarm set for a Monday morning, but my first round of allery testing was scheduled for 9am.  This turned out to be inconvenient timing A) because I had to spend the entire weekend off antihistamines and we're having a pollen explosion, and B) because Mom's car wouldn't start and she came in to ask to borrow my car when I had less than half an hour before my appointment.  I let her have my car to take her battery to Auto Zone to have them do something about it while I finished transferring some files to my Kindle and got my laundry out of the washing machine and hanging up or into the machine to dry.  She got back just as I was hanging up my T-shirts and I was only five minutes late for my appointment (which mattered not at all since I had to wait for a bit anyway).

This testing involved me stripping to the waist and lying down on the bed (it was an actual bed, since the exam room doubles as a sleep testing room) so the nurse could draw a grid or some such on my back and then start poking me with various allergens.  There was a lot of lying there waiting -- for the nurse to come in after giving me time to partially undress, for the poky bits to be done, and for my skin to have fifteen minutes to react before the nurse came back to inspect me.  She took a photo of my back for the records and informed me I had positive reactions to a lot of the trees and grass stuff they were testing me on, and also mites and cats.  And then I made an appointment for the next round of testing in about a month. (Round three is going to be food allergies, apparently.  I don't know that I have any of those, aside from probably being lactose-intolerant (which isn't really an allergy so much as lack of a digestive enzyme), so that should be educational if I get any positive reactions there.)

My back still itches.  Especially along the left shoulderblade.

<lj-cut text=""Simple but very girly mani"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Valentine-Imbolc%202015.jpg"">

I've gotten so much into the habit of using the phone camera that I couldn't get my real camera to turn on Wednesday.  Probably the battery had just run down -- but recharging it and trying again in a few hours just seemed like too much trouble at the time, as tired as I was.  So I decided to wait a day or two till I had the new phone.  Which is why this photo shows a chipped nail -- for a mani less than twenty-four hours old, I'll fix any damage that may have occurred, but by the third or fourth day I'm unlikely to bother. (Also visible is where the decal on the thumbnail got a little gouge shortly after I'd applied it and I got some white polish to daub on over the little hole and wound up smearing a bit over the borders of the heart.)

<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Valentine-Imbolc%202015%202.jpg"">

Lovely little decals.  I was taking from several sets, all of which seem to have the same maker and which I ordered as a package deal.  I used a few of the rose ones in early November for this <a href=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/BW%20Lace%202.jpg"">black and white mani</a>.</lj-cut>

And, right.  Let me post this and the only things left on today's ""to do"" list involve finishing my manicure and getting myself ready for work tonight.  And I think I should probably go ahead and get ready for bed, too, before I start playing with striping tape...</lj-cut>

"event","So the bad news is I broke my phone -- smashed the bottom corner of the touchscreen, meaning the inside is functional but my ability to work with it is severely compromised.  The good news is that I had insurance on it that is going to cover replacing it.  The bad news is that there was a $150 deductible.  The good news is that I learned I'm only a few months away from having this phone paid off -- not a whole year away, like I'd vaguely thought -- and come this summer, that's about $30 off my monthly cell phone bill.

I was told I qualify for an upgrade now, but I'd just as soon see how long I can go without having to replace my phone once it's paid off.  And I'm sure I'm getting a ""repaired and refurbished"" replacement rather than a completely new one, but still.  The reconditioned model is likely to be in better shape than the one I've been using for nearly two years, so that might postpone my next phone puchase to next year at least.

One of the things I was attempting to do with the broken phone was make a backup, since I'm sure I can plug it into my computer and copy that file off it to move to the new one.  I can't make a new backup file -- the button winds up in the portion of the screen that's not working -- but there's an option above it meant explicitly for transferring files to a new phone, and maybe I can get that to work when the new phone arrives. (If not, there's going to be a lot of manual transfer of files and individually downloading apps and tweaking settings.) Overnight shipping was involved, so maybe I'll have it tomorrow.

In the meantime, I'm using my tablet to fill in for the phone, and I'm really underwhelmed.  I can't get it to download music from my Amazon account, so I gave up and pulled out my old MP3 player to use tonight.  I may have screwed up my Google tasks list in the process of trying to get the app that manages them to update on the tablet.  And the damned thing runs so <i>slowly.</i>  At least I can use it to make this journal post complaining about the situation (and a Facebook post to let people know not to call or text me for a day or two).  Also, I downloaded my alarm clock app to the tablet to wake me up for work tonight.

Oh, here is a useful thing I just discovered:  By putting the broken phone into rotation mode (which I don't normally do because I find it a pain in the ass to have the screen always tilting on me) I can in certain screens get the navigation buttons to appear on the working end of the phone screen rather than the broken end.  And the key point is that I just tried the setting for copying to a new phone and can get it work, though it's requesting that I have the new phone ready to go before I actually go through with it.  Still, if it works it should save me some trouble tomorrow...

"event","So I just did my tax return and wound up owing $131, which is something of a disappointment. (And after getting single-digit refunds for the last couple of years, my expectations were pretty damned low.) It's very distressing and I'm probably going to console myself with chocolate. (Which I stocked up on during Sunday's grocery run, because the Valentine's candy is out in force.)

In happier news, Sunday afternoon I started dragging the brush pile from a week ago to the front yard for trash pickup, and then I started doing some more pruning of what I now had room to reach.  The excellent news is that the tree limbs that had been dying and rotting and sinking to the ground didn't require a saw -- I just had to grab and tug, and the rotted wood separated on its own. (Mostly.  There are a few trees that have some obviously dead limbs left, and Mom's talking about getting a chainsaw.) The oak sapling by the fence now has some breathing room (the tree that was really crowding it had rotted to the point where the entire stump came free when I tugged), and it's possible to actually walk beneath those trees.  I even did some trimming of branches that were overhanging the fence on that side. (Now I just need to do some of the same to the shrubbery along the back fence.)

The transformation of the backyard from primeval thicket has me thinking whimsical thoughts of setting up a little enchanted grotto under the trees.  Hanging lanterns, maybe strings of lights, perhaps a gnome or two. (Or perhaps <a href=""http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/iroi/"">a dragon toasting some gnomes</a>.) I'd be sorely tempted to put in a frog pond if I liked frogs.

In any case, the product reviews convinced me that the strings of solar-powered lights I was contemplating are of no real use for illumination in the backyard.  I got one, just to pad out the Amazon order to the free shipping point and to see how they work in person -- but mainly I was making the order to get a big motion detector light to stick on the side of the house in the backyard. (Mom is wondering if the cats will be triggering it in their nocturnal ramblings.)

I was leaving after dark to make Sunday's grocery run, and with external lighting on my mind I couldn't help but notice how many of the houses in the neighborhood have gone for stake lighting or various other forms of illumination. (Including the strand of light-up stars someone around the corner bought one December a few years ago and have just left in place over their front door.) So now that I've got the backyard lighting issue sorted (hopefully), the next purchase is lighting for the front walkway.

And also Mom and I are exploring some other more playful ideas.  I'm still thinking of sticking up some Xmas lights in the backyard, for decor if not true illumination.  And Mom spotted some wind spinners set up outside a nearby gardening supply store and she and I sat down together on Sunday browsing Amazon in that category.  There are a lot of inexpensive options and some really pricey ones.  We're tempted by the <a href=""http://smile.amazon.com/20-Bike-Spinner-Tux/dp/B00F5465B4/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1454458857&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=cat+wind+spinner"">tuxedo cat riding a bicycle</a>, but I think I'm really inclined to some sort of rainbow pinwheel for the front yard and <a href=""http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00PC37MFG/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=JR3242WD7EG6&amp;coliid=I2NB590YH71IMR"">something to dangle in the backyard that has a built-in globe light</a>.  Mom seems inclined to go by the gardening store to inspect their stock in person, so she might beat me to making a purchase.

Also, Mom brought home a bag of stargazer lily bulbs for me to plant somewhere.  I'm charmed because I think they're the very same kind I was staring contemplatively at for several minutes a few weeks ago.  Earlier today I stuck them in one of the front flowerbeds, so we'll see how they do.

<lj-cut text=""Finished object!"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/LampworkMittens8.jpg"">

So there are those, and I might even wear them a night or two this week.  Though I didn't get them finished in time to go in yesterday's laundry and wound up washing them in the sink this afternoon. (And neglecting to get them out when I was supposed to, forgetting until that moment that the Telemark black yarn indeed has a tendency to leak a bit if not given a vinegar soak.  Except that I just now recalled that it wasn't really the black yarn I used, anyway -- it was the navy blue I had an intact ball of in my stash, which was so dark I couldn't see a difference between it and the few yards of black I had left over, even when I held them together in the sunlight.  Still, I fear the white yarn may now be slightly dingy.) Anyway, so they're drying now and I don't know if they'll be ready to wear tomorrow night.

And I decided I could get away with doing the internal cuff in a leftover ball of KnitPicks Gloss I had in ""Kenai.""  I didn't realize until I had actually joined the Gloss to the mitten and started working the cuff that it was such a perfect match for the teal Telemark -- which makes sense, since they're from the same company, though the color names are different.  Had I known, I might have done the little strip of ribbing at the bottom of the mitten top in Gloss rather than the navy blue, so all the solid-color bits would have been in matching teal.  Still, I'm not too dissatisfied with that aspect of the finished project.  I just wish I'd done them a smidgen larger -- hopefully I succeeded in stretching them out while they were damp.

<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/SweetHeart8.jpg"">

And here I am starting the toe of the second sock.  Probably not going to manage to get this finished by Valentine's, but it's the top priority for the next two weeks, and should be the only project I'm really working on knitwise (aside from gym and theater knitting).</lj-cut>

My phone is being intermittently glitchy, still -- to the point where today I got out the barely-used tablet, charged it up, and turned it on to update apps and whatnot.  If my phone continues to be so cranky, I may find myself using the tablet a lot more often...

<lj-cut text=""Pretty nails"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Aqua-Purple%20Snowflakes.jpg"">

So I need more stamper practice, and I got some last week.  Not awesome but not awful.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Aqua-Purple%20Snowflakes%202.jpg"">

Part of the trick is getting the design from the plate to the stamper, and the other part is getting the polish design on the stamper to adhere to my nail when I press it in place.  I was getting some partial designs off the plate that I stuck at the edges of my nails -- but I also had a mess on the left ring finger where only half the design stuck to my nail, and I wound up sticking what was left on the right pinky.

Today's mani is pretty simple -- sparkly petal pink with black and white decals.  Mostly hearts and flowers, with some scrollwork and a butterfly.  As girly and delicate as possible.  Fairly pleasing.</lj-cut>

The amaryllis bulbs Mom and I got for Xmas are both in bloom.  Her solid red one apparently has a fungal infection -- the flowers look wonky and the advice is not to try saving the bulb for next year.  The red-and-white one I got finally started opening in the last day or two -- very pretty bloom, and no signs of fungus so far.

Also, I think I got mixed up on which pot had the pair of red mini rosebushes and which had the pink pair, because I thought I was getting a pair of tiny pink roses on the one plant that's blooming, but the green bits have opened to reveal a wee red bud.  So evidently it's the pink pair that's now in flagrant red-tinged growth, and the remaining pair of reds that are blooming. (I spotted a tiny new bud on the potmate of the one with the two opening buds.) The lone pink in a pot by itself is just sort of growing, putting out a few new sprigs but not doing anything wildly exciting.  I fertilized them all yesterday to encourage further blooms.

Meanwhile, I've been checking all the full-sized rosebushes for signs of new leaves and buds.  They all seem to have survived both black spot and my inexpert pruning.  I went back to the one in the side yard and gave it another round of trimming, since I just kept seeing where I'd want to chop more off next year.  And it has healthy green leaves remaining, plus many tender new buds near where I lopped off canes last time around, so I think I didn't kill it this time, either.

And now I need to be getting ready for bed.  And maybe getting something to eat first.  But at least I've got the ""to do"" list handled!</lj-cut>

Finally finished my first Lampwork Mitten today and got much of the way through converting the second to a flip-top.

I'm sure I'm going to work a lot of overtime tomorrow morning, but would be well advised to start hauling the brush pile in the backyard to the front curb when I get home for large trash pickup.  Also, out in the yard today inspecting where I did my trimming, and I see where I need to do some more.  The fallen tree limbs need to be attacked with an actual saw.

Also I saw a few spots where one might want to hang a lantern of some sort on protruding stubs of limbs.  I gave up on using repurposed Xmas lights for backyard illumination and ordered a proper motion-detector LED light for the side of the house.  And then a strand of pretty solar-powered lights just to get the free shipping and try them out.

And I need to finish getting ready for work...

<lj-cut text=""Some benefit to taking a few nights off work"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/LampworkMittens6.jpg"">

This was Thursday afternoon, taking a photo for Facebook to show off that I'd reached the final phase and was converting the mitten to a flip-top.  I saved that part for after I got home from Dad's, because the lighting is so much better in our living room and because I could go get some small DPNs to run through the stitches about to be freed as I unpicked the row of waste yarn, thereby ensuring none of them would get dropped in the process.

<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/LampworkMittens7.jpg"">

Not quite done with the conversion -- I still need to finish the ribbing of the internal cuff, bind it off, stitch the cast-on edge to the inside of the mitten, and tack down the black ribbing at the sides.  But that's something I can easily do the next time I get a few hours free to spend in front of the TV.  I just didn't get much knitting time over the weekend, or I'd be working on finishing the other mitten now.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Ballyronan3.jpg"">

Two weeks of progress since the last photo.  In pretty good shape, considering I shouldn't really be spending much time on this yet.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/WinterFantasy3.jpg"">

Turned the heel at Dad's, since it was simple knitting I could do in poor lighting, and since it's easier gym knitting when I'm not having to fiddle with short rows.

I didn't touch the Snowflake Mitts while I was at Dad's because the lighting in his living room was so bad. (He really wants to sit there watching movies in the dark, and I'm lucky to have a lamp at my shoulder.) And I didn't get started on the toe of the second Sweet Heart Sock because of the same lighting issue.  So it's just as well I'm not visiting Dad again until March.</lj-cut>

Late start to my weekend because I put in two hours of overtime Sunday morning.  And I was pretty damned tired from several days of not-enough-sleep, starting from going to work Thursday after a brief nap and then going very late to bed Friday afternoon because of having a long ""to do"" list and an unplanned nap in the parking lot at the gym that delayed everything I needed to deal with.  I think I spent Saturday afternoon napping on the living room couch and didn't have a lot of actual free time for anything not on the list of things that <i>needed</i> to be dealt with.  

So Sunday I got home good and late and fairly tired.  At least I got my grocery run done and then caught up on sleep that night.  No knitting time, though, and very little knitting done last night in front of the TV with Mom, because I had to get my nails trimmed and shaped for today.  

I was running behind schedule yesterday evening because I was out in the yard with the long-handled pruners attacking the undergrowth along the fence when I should have been cleaning the rabbit cage.  I finished the cage after Mom got home and saved the vacuuming for this morning.  And there's a mighty brush pile in the backyard that needs to be dragged to the front for the next large trash pickup day.

<lj-cut text=""Plaid mani for Burns Night"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Blue%20Purple%20Plaid.jpg"">

It's definitely better than <a href=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Sunset%20Tartan.jpg"">the first time I tried to do plaid</a>, but really time-consuming.  I can see why so many of the other tartan manis I was seeing (in a google image search for pointers and inspiration) were just doing plaid on the accent nails, or else doing something really simple with only two or three colors.  Adding the extra lines over the top of the basic grid made a big difference, but unfortunately the black nail art pen I was using wasn't handling the textural irregularities left by the striping tape very well -- a lot of skipping and snagging.  Some of the best manis I saw (that weren't nail wraps) involved using striping tape as a final step, sticking it on over the broader swathes of color and leaving it in place to give the sharp narrow lines.  The next time I feel compelled to do tartan, I suspect it will indeed be just on the accent nails, with the other seven nails being simple bicolor stripings or some such.

I think this week is likely to be my last real opportunity for a winter manicure, since next month I'm doing Valentine's themes for three weeks in a row, and in March it's going to be springtime themes.  I could conceivably do something wintry for the last week of February, but I kind of doubt I will.  But, leaving the option open for whatever I'm in the mood for -- it'll be a ""free"" week in between holiday manis.

In any case, I went for a really lazy decals-over-ombre mani for this week -- and then it occurred to me that it's a great opportunity to practice with the design stamper and so now I'm feeling compelled to go mess with that for at least a few nails.  But aside from adding the snowflakes and the topcoat, I've got today's mani done.

...And now I've gone and done the design stamper stuff, and have snowflakes all over my aqua-and-purple nails.  So that's done.</lj-cut>

And here I am at the end of my ""to do"" list, being down to posting this entry, shuffling a few more files around, and setting up my last folder to back up.  I'm sort of impressed with myself, given how late I was in getting onto the computer.  But then, it's generally the manicure that wrecks my Tuesday schedule, and I went with something lazy today.</lj-cut>

"event","I should have been in bed an hour ago (or at least ready for bed and typing up this journal entry) but I lost time browsing on Amazon.  I've decided I need some solar-powered stake lights for the front walkway, to keep me from stumbling over the step and the break in the concrete in the dark on my way to my car at 11:30 at night. (We've also got a lamppost with no light in it, where the walkway meets the sidewalk, and at some point it might be nice to stick some form of illumination into it.)

And also there is the backyard, where we have no working porch light and could really use some form of outdoor illumination.  Strings of solar-powered lights popped up in a set of garden-related items that were being offered for my perusal, which reminded me of <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://commodorified.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[personal profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://commodorified.dreamwidth.org/'><b>commodorified</b></a></span> talking about sticking up solar-powered Xmas lights outside the house and planning to leave them there permanently, only turning them on in December or for garden parties.  I suspect a number of the stranded lights being shown are in fact Xmas lights, now on clearance, which makes it a prime time to pick some up.  Right along the roof's edge would be an excellent place for a strand or two of lights, since we no longer have a cover over the patio.  A few stake lights marking off the concrete square of the patio wouldn't go amiss, either.

In other news, I missed my chance at visiting Grandma this week, since I was too busy Thursday afternoon after getting home from Dad's, and then ran out of time yesterday.  I had the entire Friday ""to do"" list to deal with, plus the gym session I wasn't in time to put in Wednesday morning.  And I was so tired I wound up spending two hours napping in my car in the gym parking lot before going inside. (This is a thing which sometimes happens on Wednesday mornings.  I'm used to reclining my chair for a micronap, but not for actually <i>sleeping</i> for that long.) So I was busy <i>and</i> running hours behind schedule yesterday, and Grandma missed out.

And then today I came home from work, let the bunnies out and set out tonight's clothes, and then lay down on the couch and slept till 4 or 5pm.  Which I needed (and which is why I'm so chill about not being in bed with an hour to go before my first alarm goes off), but it ate my day and kept me from getting over to see Grandma until after she'd had her dinner and gone to sleep for the night.  I didn't wake her up, just left and went to get a bag of kitty litter and my dinner. (I <i>knew</i> I should have made the time for a brief visit on Thursday afternoon.)

My tulip bulbs had arrived while I was at Dad's, and then the bulb-planting tool (a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010VUPWQ/ref=s9_simh_gw_g86_i2_r?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=desktop-1&pf_rd_r=0QGVR0FTNFBMAZMNVC6W&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=2079475242&pf_rd_i=desktop"">dibber or dibbler</a>, I've seen it spelled both ways) came in yesterday's mail and I went outside ""just to test it out"" and wound up planting all my bulbs.  Because once I got started, I kept going, and because I was already a week or three outside the best window for planting prechilled tulip bulbs in north Texas and didn't want to put it off any longer.  I broke one nail and severely chipped the polish on another, pushing bulbs down into the cold damp clay, but it's done.  

Now to wait out the months and see how many survived my inept planting technique, the crappy local soil, and the less-than-optimal planting time.  This was just an experiment in any case, testing to see where to focus my efforts this fall.  I have months to work on the flowerbeds in the meantime, clearing weeds and adding organic material (mainly rabbit cage detritus) to improve the soil quality and the drainage.

I kind of wish I'd gotten some time in on the flowerbeds before I started planting rosebushes in the front.  But for now, I've got two in place and another one I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of.  I need to get back to a fungicide-spraying program, since three bushes are largely defoliated and the Perfume Delight is suffering.  But Dad gave a try at assembling my sprayer and informed me I was missing some parts.  Either I try to make do with what I've got, bother the manufacturer to send along what I need, or steal Mom's plant sprayer. (Which she remembered the existence of <i>after</i> I'd already asked her about it and then bought my own.  If she can find it I'll commandeer it, since I seem to have taken over the gardening anyway, lawncare aside.) Also I may buy a squirt bottle of something suitable at Lowe's tomorrow on the way home, postponing dealing with sprayers and concentrated chemicals for another week or two.

The mini-roses are fairly happy, aside from being occasionally pissed on by the cats. (I rearranged the setup, turning the baby highchair so it can no longer be used as a convenient stepping-off point to reach the blocked-off section of the table, and setting a squirt bottle of something-or-other to block the spot where a cat in the seat of the chair pushed in at the end of the table might pop up and put his front paws between the two flowerpots closest to the edge.  No more signs of widdling on the pots, though it's only been two days since I shifted things.) New growth on all five plants (ignoring the wee stub of a sixth plant that's very slowly dying) and a couple of buds on the largest one.  They seem to find the light level coming in through that kitchen window acceptable, though I'm sticking them outside tomorrow since it'll be warmer tomorrow night.  The more unblocked sunlight they get (and the less access the cats have to them), the better.

Oh, and my visit to Dad was largely successful.  He failed to assemble my plant sprayer but I pruned his two rosebushes, and then Thursday morning before I left he turned on his laptop and tried to log into his AOL account.  We reset his password but had no luck getting in, and then after he gave up and went to the living room I gave it one more try -- and checked under the help link and found the warning that AOL discontinues any account that hasn't been used for 90 days.  So Dad's going to have to call AOL to see about getting it back, and I'll wait to see if he gets that done or has to create a new e-mail account. (Hopefully Amazon won't give me too much trouble over the delay in turning up a working e-mail address for those e-books I bought for him.) I told him I'll probably take my next few vacation days for a visit in March.

The other thing I was hoping to accomplish with my time off was getting a lot done on my mittens.  And I finished the body of the second mitten and did both thumbs on Wednesday -- now it's just a matter of getting them converted to flip-tops.  I opened the palm of the right one on Thursday afternoon and got the ribbing done on the top flap.  The internal cuff is taking a bit more trouble, since I'm having to figure out how many stitches to cast on for the back of the hand using trial and error. (I had to rip it back a couple of times.) Once I've got that worked out, the left mitten will go a lot faster.  I plan to do that tomorrow in front of the TV -- get my mittens finished, so I can shift gears to the Snowflake Mitts and Sweet Heart Socks. (I have, after all, completed the first heart sock, so I've set myself an arbitrary deadline of Valentine's Day to get the second one done by.)

And, yes.  I have very little time left before I need to start getting ready to leave for work, but I can lay down in the dark for a short time to set an symbolic endpoint on today...

"event","So Burns Night is coming up, and since I'm always looking for manicure themes that makes this week a good time for a second try at a <a href=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Sunset%20Tartan.jpg"">plaid mani</a>.  And also a good time for Mom and I to resume watching <i>Outlander</i>, which we watched the first half-season of but never got around to picking back up.  The missing half-season is available On Demand (having been lost when the DVR wiped itself last month), and the second season should be airing soon, so time to catch up. (We saw a <i>Downton Abbey</i> and two eps of <i>Outlander</i> last night.)

And I got to a late start yesterday, but since I'd done my grocery run Sunday afternoon I was still able to get everything done (vacuuming included) but filing my nails for today's mani by the time Mom got home from work.  So I was able to get started on the computerage at a decent time today.  Which is great since as soon as I post this entry I'm out the door to go visit Dad for a day or two...

<lj-cut text=""Not a lot of knitting last week"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/LampworkMittens5.jpg"">

This was the only project worth taking a picture of. (I put rows onto the Ballyronan cowl and the blue stockings, but I'm going to wait for more visible progress before I take more photos of those.) Tomorrow is basically going to be spending the entire day in front of the TV with Dad, so I expect to get the body of the second mitten done and hopefully both thumbs as well.  Friday night is supposed to be fairly cold, so I may want to wear these then.  Getting at least the right mitten converted to a flip-top by Friday afternoon would be helpful.</lj-cut>

I tried to assemble the plant sprayer this morning so I could go out and treat the rosebushes for their ongoing black spot problems, but I found the instructions confusing.  And since I'm headed over to Dad's to help <i>him</i> with a bit of plant maintenance (I tossed my large and small pruning shears into the trunk of my car, and borrowed a pair of Mom's gardening gloves), I'm going to ask him for help in getting the sprayer put together. (Which is probably going to mean me handing the box and the instructions to him and letting him do it.)

<lj-cut text=""Pretty purple nails"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Plum%20Lilac.jpg"">

I wish I'd been able to use the sparkly lilac instead of this flatter shade of lavender.  Aside from that, this was a mani that did exactly what I wanted it to do.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Plum%20Lilac%202.jpg"">

Some smudging on the lines on the right pinky, but I mostly was able to clean that up with a striping brush dipped in acetone.  Again, it did what I wanted it to do.

Today's mani took ages because of all the striping tape.  And then I added some freehanded lines using silver and black, so I've lost the effect of the perfect white lines left by pulling up the tape -- but it looks complicated and a little messy, like a real tartan.  That's the problem with the last time I tried doing plaid -- I didn't make it complex enough.  It was too much like a regular grid with a few rows and columns filled in with a different color.  Adding the extra lines made it work. (Though it took an awful long time.  I might have been better off with most of the nails in solid colors or simple stripes and just a few accent nails in full plaid.)</lj-cut>

And there I am.  My nails really haven't had enough time for the final round of topcoat to harden, but if I can get myself into the car without smudging they'll have a longish drive in which to cure.  Just need to get off the computer, feed the cats, and hit the road...</lj-cut>

"event","So apparently I'm turning middle-aged, because I'm starting to get into gardening.

First it was the roses, which I've always liked anyway (and used to be able to enjoy effortlessly, since Mom had the magnificent climbing bushes all over the back fence of the house we lived in until I was thirteen).  So now I've got four rosebushes in the ground (and an <a href=""http://www.regannursery.com/plant/Ebb-Tide"">Ebb Tide</a> bush being shipped), and five mini-roses in pots to fuss over.

And then suddenly I wanted tulips.  And Mom mentioned having tried planting iris bulbs in the front flowerbeds a few years back that never did anything -- except now they seem to be sending up experimental spikes in the front bed where I've been watering and fertilizing the roses.  So I started looking and it seems that fall was really when I should have been planting bulbs -- however, tulip-planting season in our area is Thanksgiving to New Year's (with eight weeks of the bulbs chilling in the refrigerator before they go in the ground, unless one orders prechilled bulbs) and I've seen some references to being able to get away with an early January planting.

So I just ordered a smattering of pink and purple prechilled tulip bulbs on today's paycheck, and when they come I'm going to use them to test which areas of the front and back yards are most suitable for bulbs.  In the little bed surrounding a pair of trees in the back?  In the corner by the back fence where the daffodils come up each spring (and are apparently years overdue for digging up the bulbs and splitting them)?  In the bed in the side of the backyard where the rosebushes died off?  Can I get away with putting tulips towards the front edge of the bed with the rosebushes in the front?  How about the neglected bed on the other side of the front yard?

And then -- I've marked my calendar with a reminder -- next fall should be a Bulb Extravaganza.  Heavy emphasis on plants that come back, but I still like a few tulips, and irises for Mom.  Lots of purple.  And a few daffodils from the backyard can be transplanted to the front.

Also -- there's the spot in the front yard where we're planning on an oak seedling, and it'll need to be in some way marked to avoid being mowed over while it's establishing itself.  I was thinking of getting some of those ornamental borders and setting up a round flowerbed surrounding the oak sapling.  And then, bulbs this fall.

I came home from work this morning absolutely exhausted and after freeing the bunnies and setting out tonight's clothes I lay down on the couch and slept for six hours.  So I'm good for tonight (though I plan on at least a token nap before work), and when Mom got home from work we were able to chat about gardening plans.  She dug out her books from when she was into gardening a few decades ago (including one that was originally a gift from a gardening friend to <i>me</i>, which I passed over to Mom because at the time I thought she was more likely to take gardening back up than I was to ever get into it) and I flipped through a few.  The first one I looked at was a guide specific to the Dallas area (which would have been useful when I was trying to identify the trees in the backyard), and the next was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/You-Grow-Girl-Gayla-Trail/dp/0743270142/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452913073&sr=8-1&keywords=you+grow+girl"">You Grow Girl</a> (the above-mentioned gift from <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://twitter.com/txtriffidranch'><img src='http://twitter.com/favicon.ico' alt='[twitter.com profile] ' style='vertical-align: bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' width='16' height='16'/></a><a href='http://twitter.com/txtriffidranch'><b>txtriffidranch</b></a></span>).

And, okay.  I finished this entry half an hour ago and then started wasting time screwing around on my computer.  Time to post this and nap for a bit...

"event","Yeah, definitely going to have to make an ongoing routine of getting the grocery run handled on Sundays.  

Monday started out off-kilter with me having to get up early to go to a doctor's appointment. (I got up early enough to get my laundry done before I left.) The appointment was a waste of time because I was going in for an allergy test, but I'd forgotten the test was coming up with its no-antihistamines-for-72-hours-beforehand rule and I'd taken an allergy pill on Friday night.  So my test was rescheduled for next month and I was sent home.

I puttered around in slow motion, got the dishes done and the rabbit cage cleaned, and then made the mistake of going out to get lunch without getting the vacuuming done first.  After lunch I passed out in the love seat till 5pm and went to visit Grandma.  I hoped I'd get the vacuuming done that night after I got home, but not so much. (Though Mom and I had a good evening, opening a bottle of wine for the first time in months and watching the first two eps of the final season of <i>Downton Abbey</i>.)

So I had the vacuuming left to deal with this morning and it got me off to a really slow start.

<lj-cut text=""Some amount of knitting"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/LampworkMittens4.jpg"">

I am holding off on the thumb until the body of the second mitten is done, because I probably have enough to do it in teal to match the ribbing, but I don't want to risk running out and having mis-matched thumbs. (Or worse yet, running out of teal before I finish the colorwork on the second mitten and having to order another skein and wait for it to arrive before I can finish.)  The grey line on the palm is the row done with a piece of waste yarn that I'll be unpicking to make an opening for a flip-top.  That's the very last step in making this pair, since once I've got the thumbs I'll have a perfectly functional pair of regular mittens I could actually wear until I've got the time to convert them.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Ballyronan2.jpg"">

Still not a priority, but I might as well put in a few repeats here and there while it's what I'm feeling the strongest urge to work on.  It's my visiting-with-Grandma knitting, but I've also been working on for a few repeats before getting out the mitten.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/WinterFantasy2.jpg"">

And this is the gym knitting, which means progress will be incremental but ongoing.</lj-cut>

Windows 10 has completely ruined my backup process.  Though it turns out to be so much quicker to delete the old backup and copy the whole folder afresh, instead of letting it just copy over the new files -- so basically, that's what I need to start doing.

<lj-cut text=""Last week's mani"">

Icy blue, with decals from three different sets whose main commonality is in being designs commonly seen in colorwork knitting.  I did not realize the red and blue set came with white backing -- that gives me much more options in terms of base colors to use them over.

I do love the way the white decals looked over this pale blue.  And the argyle went well, too.  I'd had that set for at least a year and never gotten around to trying them out, or been quite sure what color I could use them over.

I've been wearing a lot of purple lately -- new sweater-vest, new watch, and I ordered a recent TeeFury design largely based on it being printed on a purple shirt.  So I felt like doing a purple mani -- especially since I hadn't really been able to use the color for the last couple of months, it not being the right color for either Thanksgiving or Xmas themes.  Today I went with soft lavender and rich plum over a pale gold base color.  Two accent nails were gold decals over a lavender thumb and a plum ring finger -- the other thumb should have been plum as well, but I forgot while I was putting on the first layer of color.  Still, I'm thrilled with how it turned out -- the color combo was exactly what I'd hoped for, and the execution wasn't too shabby.</lj-cut>

Oh, the roses.  I checked on the one in the sideyard today to see how it was recovering from last week's pruning, and wound up snipping off a few more bits that were crossing another stem, curling around oddly to press against the window, or just looked too spindly to support much future growth.  Healthy new growth in several spots, and plenty of leaves on the remaining bits.

And I gave up on the rose that the cats pissed on. (It may not just be the urine -- I think the plant was damaged at the base from being squashed.  Also a possibility is that it was peed on repeatedly before the effects became apparent -- but it went from healthy to shriveled in a 24-hour period, so.) It was the largest and healthiest of the mini-roses, which is why I'm so especially annoyed at losing it -- but that's why I put it in the big pot by itself.  Which ironically may have doomed it, since that was the only pot big enough for a cat to climb into.  I made a fence of flattened out cardboard boxes to enclose the remaining plants just in case.  I've seen a few attempts to gain access to the blocked-off end of the kitchen table, but I used my plant sprayer tank (still in its box) as a weight to anchor the barrier, and the pots are too close to the edge of the table on the open side for a cat to jump up there. (I saw one leaper that wound up on the floor after scrabbling for a non-existent landing space.) The little stub of a plant that was fighting to bud new leaves to replace the ones it dropped is starting to look like it's losing ground, too.  Five healthy mini-roses, though.

I planted the amaryllis bulbs Mom and I got for Xmas, and the spikes projecting from the tops of the pots have turned green and started growing.  I looked up amaryllis care online last night and am discouraged by how much trouble is involved if one wants to preserve the bulbs from year to year.  Also, the plant with the largest growth evidently has a fungus that supposedly won't stop it from blooming but <i>will</i> hamper its longterm survivability.

And, right.  I need to go take a quick shower and get into bed for my pre-work nap...</lj-cut>

"event","So I made a special point of getting the grocery run out of the way on Sunday, and that meant that Monday I was able to get the rabbit cage cleaned and head out the door to visit Grandma around 3pm with most of my ""to do"" list accomplished.  I stopped off on the way to visit Calloway's, and afterwards Lowe's (where the Calloway's staff sent me, since they were out of long-handled pruners).  I came home from visiting Grandma and attacked the long-neglected rose in the sideyard.

<lj-cut text=""The end result"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Pruned%20Rose%20Sm.jpg"">

I didn't think to take a ""Before"" picture, but here's when I was done.  Cleared away a shitload of deadwood, and then snipped off the branch that sticks out from the side flowerbed to attack passing lawnmowers, and then did a bit of whittling on the remaining branches.  I'm comfortable with this rose being this tall, so long as it's not a monstrous thornbush.</lj-cut>

In other rose-related news, I think a cat used the big flowerpot as a litterbox last night.  The largest and most vigorous of the mini-roses was looking shriveled (and a bit squashed) this morning, and the paper toweling under its pot was soaked and discolored.  I watered the hell out of it after I carried the pots to the front porch for their afternoon sun -- hopefully I can leach the salts out of the soil with sufficient flow-through (or so gardening sites have led me to believe).  After tonight we have a stretch of several days with temps no lower than the 40s, so I'll leave the pots out in the backyard till the next temperature drop. (Which should be next weekend.) There may be rain tomorrow -- hopefully much of it coming after I've gotten home from work and stuck the roses outside.

The things I left for after the trip to see Grandma were taking down the Xmas tree, then doing the vacuuming after the area by the TV had been cleared, and finally getting my nails ready for today's manicure.  Only I was kind of out of gas after I finished with the rose pruning, and then Mom got home before I got going again, and so what happened was dinner and laziness.  At least I got the tree stripped and disassembled before I went to bed, so this morning I just had the vacuuming (and my nails) left over from yesterday.

<lj-cut text=""Knitting in the new year"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/PurpleTurquoise6.jpg"">

I got the heel done and the loose ends woven in, so now I'm going to put this into hibernation and let the blue Winter Fantasy stockings be the gym-and-visiting-Grandma project for a while.  Although...


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Ballyronan1.jpg"">

Here's my New Year's project for 2016.  There are a few other things higher-priority than another cowl, but I think I should rack up some pattern repeats while I'm still enthusiastic about the new project.  And it's something I proved yesterday I can do while visiting with Grandma (and not have to find somewhere to rest a pattern chart), being a simple four-row lace repeat that I've already largely memorized.  I think St Patrick's Day looks like a suitable arbitrary deadline to try to have this done by -- I'll work on it now as I have the time and interest, then around about the beginning of March start pushing to finish it.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/LampworkMittens3.jpg"">

This is the highest-priority project on the needles right now, since I could really use a better, warmer pair of flip-top mittens.  Having decided that this pair of handcoverings needs to be the mittens and the other set are best left as mitts, I should be working on this as much as I can in the next few weeks.  Only I'm dithering again -- now I'm wondering if I should frog them (for a second time) and switch to a larger needle size.  The wrist ribbing is uncomfortably tight (and I made it a long ribbing, for a mitt, rather than a shorter one meant to tuck under the heavy sleeves of a coat) and I worry about the hand part being too stiff and tight.  The thought of frogging and losing the work done so far makes me disinclined to put more work into it that may go to waste, but on the other hand I'm still not sure I really want to frog it.  

No, I <i>know</i> I don't <i>want</i> to frog the mitt, but I'm wondering if I <i>need</i> to.  And postponing making a final decision.  And working on other projects in the meantime, though this is the one I need the most right now.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/SnowflakeMitts2.jpg"">

It's very beautiful and I'm looking forward to having the finished result.  It's also fairly thin, suitable for chill rather than serious cold, so it's a thing I can probably get a few wearings out of even if it takes me till March to finish.  No rush. (Which is good, since it's slow and fiddly and I have that other pair of mitts I should be focusing on.)</lj-cut>

I got the vacuuming done without too much time-wasting, and was on the computer before noon for the first Tuesday in quite some time.  I'm feeling like I've got all the time in the world, unusual for a Tuesday -- reason enough to keep the grocery run to Sundays. (Or move it to a different day, as I discussed with Mom.  We both do our grocery run at the start of the week, which means we're fighting for space in a crammed refrigerator, and if I started doing my shopping on Wednesday or Thursday Mom would have eaten some of her food by the time I needed the space.) Also there's the thing where I got online Sunday and did a little of the reading I'd have been otherwise doing today.  And there's the lazy manicure I did today (which is already finished).

<lj-cut text=""Sparkly party nails for the new year"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/New%20Years%202016.jpg"">

That thumb looked especially awesome.  I need to keep using that starburst thing when I do a striping tape manicure.  But also, it was a great combination, of the shiny black and the glittering metallic silver.

<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/New%20Years%202016%202.jpg"">

I need to redo my pedicure, and I left the silver and blue and purple sitting out to use.  But not yesterday or today, because it's cold and I'm in my plushy knit houseboots.  Maybe when we get a warmish snap later this week I'll tend to my toes...

The theme for this week's manicure is It's Frickin' Cold Outside (and Also in This Bedroom) -- pale icy blue with decals that look like fancy knitting patterns.  The argyle decals even have silver glitter.</lj-cut>

I have caught up on sleep over the last few days, which was excellent.  And here I am winding up the Tuesday list shockingly early by recent standards.  I'm going to transfer to the living room to eat (I think today calls for grilled cheese and tomato soup) and then hang out and wait for Mom to get home.  I haven't moved the cat tree back to its regular spot by the TV or set up the bunny corner next to it, because the sideboard needs to be moved back to <i>its</i> regular spot, and that's a two-person job.  So when Mom gets home we move furniture.  

And then I have every chance of getting to bed unusually early for a Tuesday...</lj-cut>

"event","I am greatly annoyed at having put in two full shifts earlier this week when I had hopes of getting out early all week.  At one point I was suddenly distressed at the thought of coming to the end of the year with too much ""use it or lose it"" paid time off remaining and actually losing some of it.  Fortunately I only had just about four days' worth when I checked -- hopefully that won't be lost.  Especially since I used up another five hours last night, getting out at just a smidgen past 3am.  I had a shorter shift on New Year's Eve, too, and used it the same way I used last night's early release -- coming home and getting some sleep.

So New Year's Day I largely spent in front of the TV, knitting, and the day after in much the same way, aside from running some errands.  I had been given a Target gift card by one cousin, whose family all seem to shop there regularly and who don't realize Mom and I only seem to set foot in the store when we have a gift card to use up.  I went yesterday hoping to find some long-handled pruning shears to use for trimming the rosebushes and discovered A) my aunt also shopping there and B) the gardening stuff isn't out yet.  But I got some Xmas chocolates at 50% off, and should have gotten some nail polish as well except I didn't realize how little of the gift card I was actually using up until I got to the register.  Had to grab some lip balm and chewing gum just to pad out the total.

Today I came home and slept till noon -- now I need to get out the door and hit the gym.  The plan is to take care of the grocery shopping today so there's one less item on tomorrow's list. (I'm getting a smidgen of computerage out of the way right now, to post the journal entry I should have done yesterday and maybe shorten Tuesday's ""to do"" list a bit.) Also I made noises about getting the tree down today, though it's already kind of late in the afternoon and I could do it tomorrow afternoon instead.  

Mom is currently taking down the outside lights (unless she's moved on to the living room decorations by now), and is very peeved because she discovered a leak in the spigot in the front flowerbed. (That has been going for who knows how long, and what will this month's water bill be like and how much of the standing water in the front flowerbed may be blamed on the seeping hose rather than the rains?) She dragged me away from the computer in the hopes that I would be able to turn it off (laboring under the delusion that my upper body strength is greater than hers, though I gave up using the weights at the gym <i>years</i> ago and now only do cardio) and wasn't at all pleased to hear that the tap is in the full ""off"" position and she needs to call a plumber to deal with it. (I think she called my uncle instead.) She seemed inclined to blame me for ""not trying hard enough"" to perform a task I already knew was futile when I splashed through the mud to the spigot.  So there's that, and I need to get off the computer and escape to the gym soonish.

Last night I put in a vacation request to give myself another four-day weekend in January.  Because otherwise that month will suck entirely.  And also I should go visit Dad.  Nag him about getting his e-mail thing sorted out so he can receive the e-books I bought him for Xmas, maybe help him prune a neglected rosebush in his front yard he was complaining to me about.  Get some sleep, etc.

Also, I am suffering from knitting-related waffling.  I found my lost mitt and so the Lampwork Mitts lost importance and a new pair of flip-top mittens seemed to be the highest priority project to complete while the weather is cold and bleak.  But over the last few days of putting actual progress onto the Snowflake Mitten, I've come to the conclusion that the Snowflake Mitten is ill-suited for extreme cold, being made from fingering-weight yarn, while the Lampwork Mitt is thick and solid.  Also, the Lampwork Mitt is working up very quickly, while the Snowflake Mitt is slow work but very beautiful.  I think I'll be happier with the final results if I make the Lampwork pair into the flip-top mittens and the Snowflake Mitts just mitts as the pattern calls for.  Then I'll have a really <i>warm</i> pair of mittens (very quickly) and eventually a very beautiful pair of mitts that'll be worn much more often.

Right, time to head out the door!

"event","Sunday's get-together at my aunt's was kind of a bust.  Only one of my three cousins bothered to show up (and he <i>wasn't</i> the one who actually lives with my aunt and uncle, either) and Lauren decided to stay home because of the rain and the flooding and the cold and the baby not having a winter coat yet. (He got one from Mom for an Xmas gift, as per Lauren's request, but he didn't have it at the time Lauren was contemplating making the trip.  Also there was the thing where her husband declared the roads were too hazardous for her to make the trip, whether she wanted to come or not.) So Mom and I brought home the gifts for Lauren and her boys, and left the ones for the missing cousins and their kids.  A brief visit with family and then home.

I need to seriously consider moving my computerage-and-manicure to Mondays -- or see if I can move a few Monday things to Sunday and at least get started on the Tuesday list on Monday afternoon.  Because I got the grocery run done Sunday morning and was all done with the rest of the Monday list by about noon yesterday -- aside from the visit to Grandma -- in large part because Lauren was supposedly coming over around then with her boys for our gift exchange.  

Mom and I were waiting around for her for hours (which I didn't mind too much because I was knitting in front of the TV) and then there was much unwrapping.  Aidyn got in touch with his inner Dudley Dursley, at one point being outraged at how few gifts he had received.  Just to add to his sense of grievance, he tore madly through his packages while Mom was slowly opening Axton's gifts, and reached a point where all the nice big presents left were for the baby. (He was also a pain in the ass when we visited Grandma on Xmas Eve, and on Xmas Day Mom made a special point of getting a single gift apiece for him and for the baby out of the pile she had for them and taking it over to my aunt's house, so he wouldn't be sitting around watching everyone else open gifts with nothing in the pile for him.) Lauren was delighted by her gifts and annoyed by her son's vocal ingratitude (and his whining to go home so he could play his new game).

Eventually Mom and I got Lauren and her kids out the door so we could go to see Star Wars.  It was good, though my pleasure in the film was overshadowed by my delight at discovering my missing mitt while rummaging through my purse for a snack near the end of the film. (Turned out it had gotten stuffed into a zipper pocket I had forgotten about the existence of, just inside the front pocket I keep my mitts in.) We came home, had pizza, zonked out in front of the TV, and then got caught up in watching a Nutcracker performance from a few years back that was airing on some cable channel.  I didn't get to bed till 2 or 3am, which wasn't good.

<lj-cut text=""Holiday knitting"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/SweetHeart7.jpg"">

Got this sock bound off this morning.  No rush on getting the second one cast on, since I have a few other projects I'd really like to have done while the weather's still cold enough to need them.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/WinterFantasy1.jpg"">

It is boring dark blue (albeit sparkly) and will continue to be so until fifty rows away from the ribbing when I join some white yarn (also sparkly) and knit an icicle colorwork pattern.  I rushed to get the toe done and the ends woven away so I'd have this ready for theater knitting.  Now it can just be gym knitting for a while -- there's no hurry, and I'll be fine with not getting to wear these till next winter.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/PurpleTurquoise5.jpg"">

Just started the heel a few hours ago while visiting Grandma.  After I get that done and back into the striping pattern, I may back-burner these for a while and let the icicle stocking be the gym knitting for a few months.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/LampworkMitts1.jpg"">

First try at working this mitts pattern.  I tried it on at my aunt's on Sunday afternoon and was dismayed to discover the ribbing was too tight. (Incidentally, this is not the first color scheme I tried.  I was having a hard time getting gauge and then took another look at the pattern and realized the worsted weight was for the hat, while the mitts were to be done in sport weight.  I went back to the stash and pulled out the leftover yarn from my <a href=""http://ravel.me/FyrDrakken/3b"">Berge Sweater</a>.)


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/LampworkMitts2.jpg"">

Once I'd gotten over the disappointment at having to frog the mitt and try again (this time ignoring the pattern's instructions to make the wrist ribbing on a needle one size smaller than I used to get gauge for the main mitt), I realized I was kind of glad to have an excuse to start this over.  The pattern <i>also</i> called for an afterthought thumb, and I'm really a big fan of thumb gussets, so I decided to revise the thumb this time around and use my standard glove pattern for that part.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/SnowflakeMittens1.jpg"">

I have just barely begun on the Snowflake Mitten because a replacement set of mitts was a higher priority.  But having found my lost mitt, I now need a better pair of flip-top mittens more than I need another set of mitts, so this is going to be a focus for the next few weeks.  I want to get the new pairs of handcoverings done quickly, while I have the extra free time and while the weather's still cold.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Glenhaven%20Silver%20-%20Rio.jpg"">

I made an impulse buy the Friday before Xmas that I retroactively declared to have been spending my Xmas money in advance.  This is the package I opened with Mom on Xmas night -- this lovely sockyarn with silver sparkles in it...


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Finley%20Fingering%20-%20At%20Rainbow's%20End.jpg"">

...and this skein that was only available as part of a kit with a scarf or cowl pattern and an included shawl pin.  Think I'll go ahead and make the cowl -- think I'll have that be my ceremonial New Year's Day project, in fact. (I'm still working on my <i>last</i> New Year's Day project -- only just pulled it out of hibernation a few weeks ago -- so I'm not inclined to go for something big for 2016.  I want to do lots of sockknitting and stashbusting.)</lj-cut>

Not a wildly exciting Xmas this year -- not a whole hell of a lot going on giftwise anymore at my age, and not a lot of time off, either.  Think I'm going to have to make a special point of using up some vacation time in January, if only to cure the doldrums. (Oh, geeze, how much time have I got left?  And how much am I going to be able to burn off witih short shifts in the next few days?  Am I actually going to have more vacation time than I'm allowed to carry over to the new year and wind up <i>losing</i> some of it?)

<lj-cut text=""Festive manicure"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Xmas%202015%20Final.jpg"">

I was really happy with that freehanded Santa belly on my thumb.  It filled me with delight every time I looked at my hand.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Xmas%202015%20Final%202.jpg"">

Nothing really exciting, though I'm happy with how the sleigh decal on my thumb looked over the gold polish underneath.  And unlike the red-and-white decal set I used a few weeks ago, this green actually very nearly matched the green polish I used on some other fingers.

Today's mani isn't New Year's specific like <a href=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/New%20Years%202015.jpg"">last year's</a> -- just sparkly party nails, striping-tape-work in three colors over a shiny silver basecoat.  I was thinking about doing a coat of silver glitter over the top of everything, but the black-and-silver nails look so wonderfully sharp I don't want to risk messing it up.</lj-cut>

So I still need to sort new pictures into folder and finish setting up my backups.  Windows 10 has absolutely fucked up the backup routine -- it takes a longassed time sorting through files before finally demanding I tell it how to handle anything that already exists in the backup folder, and if the computer goes into sleep mode before I'm around to give it the answer then the backup process pauses and I can't figure out how to restart it. (So the stuff I set up to run before I went to visit Grandma this afternoon had to be restarted and then it paused itself <i>again</i> while I was eating a sandwich and finishing my manicure, and it's still sorting itself out...) This is another reason I may need to start doing the computerage on Mondays.</lj-cut>

"event","So Thursday morning I wound up putting in a full shift at work after all.  I got some breakfast on the way home and then hit Hobby Lobby and Michael's seeking circular knitting needles in sizes 2 and 3.  Got home and put things away and generally took care of things I needed to do before work that night, telling Mom noon was a good time for Lauren to come meet us so we could all go see Grandma.

So of course Lauren didn't show up till 1:30.  Not that I minded much, having spent the wait knitting while watching Netflix. (Mom had been troubleshooting and replacing cables on the living room TV, and had gotten a replacement DVR from AT&T besides. By Xmas Eve the cable was still out but the Netflix streaming worked, proving that the TV itself was still functional.  And the DVR was recording again, too.)

Grandma enjoyed the heck out of our visit.  She was largely oblivious to the gifts (Aidyn was enlisted to assist in the paper-tearing process) but having a six-month-old great-grandson sitting next to her to coo at made her entire <i>week.</i>

 I got Mom to swing by Taco Bell on the way home (<i>starving</i> by that point) and then after we ate shooed her to her bedroom so I could wrap gifts.  She offered to help, I asked for a few minutes to get hers done first, and wound up taking care of all of them while watching <i>Jessica Jones</i>.  Then to bed for a too-short nap before work.

I went to work on Xmas Eve thinking that if I got out of there with only half a shift I'd be satisfied.  I finished at 3:30 but didn't enjoy it, being too bitterly resentful at the two people sharing my job function who walked out the door just as I was being handed another hour's worth of work.  If they had stayed until we were all done, I'd have gotten out of there at least half an hour earlier. (And I had worked through my break, too, so I was <i>starving</i>, which didn't improve my mood a bit.) I escaped, hit IHOP on the way home, and got in a five-hour nap before heading to Dad's.

A very quiet Xmas -- just Dad and my aunt and uncle and me.  My aunt had a few gifts for me (an insulated lunch bag, an adult coloring book with a set of colored pencils, and a kit for planting and growing an amaryllis bulb, which cracked me up because I'd gotten the same kit for Mom, though in a different color).  Fortunately none of them was very expensive, so I felt <i>slightly</i> less guilty for not having brought anything for her and my uncle.

Not the only gift-giving fail of the day.  I made a point of taking the time to select and purchase a set of e-books for Dad before leaving the house Xmas morning (and glad I did, since neither the Amazon phone app nor the mobile browser allowed for gift purchases -- I had to do it on my desktop).  When I got to Dad's and pulled out my phone to text Mom that I'd arrived safely, I discovered a series of e-mails from Amazon announcing that the address I'd sent the e-books to was nondeliverable.  I doublechecked my contacts but I hadn't mistyped the address I had for Dad.  So I asked him about it and he realized he hadn't logged into his AOL account for months.  I suggested he do so before I left so we could sort out the problem (and possibly that he should set up a g-mail account and switch his Amazon account to that), but Showtime was running a <i>Dexter</i> marathon and it was a season Dad had missed so we spent a lot of time watching that (at Dad's house and my uncle's both) and Dad never got around to getting on his computer.  I need to text him to remind him to deal with it. (It wasn't until I was driving home that night that I realized Dad had also forgotten to give me a gift.)

Horribly tired driving home and thought I would just put things away, tend the bunnies and collapse into bed.  But running around the house sticking turkey into the fridge, putting gifts and knitting project bags away, and fussing over the rabbits woke me up enough to want to unwrap gifts with Mom.  I had three packages for her, she had a card with money for me, and I got a still-unopened package of yarn I had ordered a week ago partially in anticipation of Xmas money that I ceremonially opened in front of Mom. (A throwback to Xmases past, when Mom gave me gift money in advance and the Loopy Ewe was so lightning-fast with its shipping that my purchase arrived by Xmas Eve and I gave the box to Mom to wrap for me to open the next morning.)

And then I slept, and woke to spend the day knitting, aside from leaving the house to get kitty litter and gas and Irish cream (and to deposit my gift cash into checking).  After Xmas Eve and Xmas Day and yesterday, the state of the knitting is fair.  The blue icicle stocking is past the toe, making it into something I can work on in a darkened theater when Mom and I go to see Star Wars.  The Snowflake Mitten is ceremonially cast on, but back-burnered while I replace my mitts.  The Lampwork Mitt is a few rows into the colorwork of the palm and is what I'm planning to spend most of today's knitting time working on. (Aside from the gym and possibly the visit to my aunt and uncle's for a gift exchange today at 2pm.) And one of the two skeins of yarn I ordered last week is part of a kit for either a scarf or a cowl that I think I should do once the Lampwork Mitts are done.

Very light workload tonight -- an hour into my shift and I was idle enough to type up the first half of this entry while waiting for more work to arrive.  I was done for the night by 3am and stayed long enough to eat my fruit (which I had forgotten to bring home on Xmas Eve when I left and was still in the breakroom fridge) and finish this entry.  Now I'm off to hit the gym and get my grocery run out of the way.  Don't know whether I'll want to go to bed for a few more hours after that or just knit in front of the TV until time to leave for my aunt's... (Mom, incidentally, solved the final cable problem this afternoon by moving the HDMI cable to a different input jack.  So now I can watch the Doctor Who Xmas episode in the living room instead of my bedroom.)

"event","It's the manicure that really wrecks my Tuesdays.  If I get started on it too late, I'm staying up too late to finish it and probably going to bed with sticky nails as well.  Here it is 7:30 and I'm not done yet -- in fact, I think I may need to save part of it for tomorrow...

Nope, I cheated.  I had three nails I was planning to use striping tape on, and I wound up sticking full-nail decals on two of them.  The third I just free-handed.

Anyway, the living room TV remains non-functional.  The new power cord didn't work, and when Mom tried swapping cable boxes between the living room and her room to see if the problem was with the TV or with the cable box, she found that neither the box nor the TV appears to work.  She suspects something shorted out and wrecked box and TV alike.  She got a new cable box from AT&T, which arrived today, so right now she's in the living room fiddling with connections and muttering to herself. (Meanwhile, I finished <i>Daredevil</i> and got started on <i>Jessica Jones</i>, and Mom watched <i>The Knick</i> without me, so I need to catch that episode on my own.)

Also on Sunday afternoon Mom got outside with some more rainbow chasing lights and outlined the flower beds.

<lj-cut text=""The final version of the house lights"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Lights%204%20Sm.jpg"">

I like it -- it fixes the narrow focus of just having the front door and walkway outlined.  I would have loved adding another spare strand to each of the trees on the corner of the house, but this is good. (And more vivid in person than it is in the photo, because the rainbow strands on the walkway and flowerbeds are flickering between colors and only lighting one shade at a time.)</lj-cut>

And I got a lot of knitting done with my time off.

<lj-cut text=""Progress being made"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Osk2.jpg"">

So this vest is officially out of hibernation.  That's the back, the widest section, so once it's done the side gores and front panels will work up a lot faster.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/SweetHeart6.jpg"">

Onto the top ribbing.  I'm debating postponing the second sock so I can make the Snowflake Mitts quickly, because I think I'll need the size 2 needle for them and I only seem to have one. (Need to make a KnitPicks order and get another size 2 and size 3 cable needle...)


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/BlueCatrionas14.jpg"">

Foot begun and moving right along.  This makes for decent knitting while visiting Grandma.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/PurpleTurquoise4.jpg"">

And this is good gym knitting -- I think after tomorrow's session I'll be pretty near to starting the heel.

I came to a decision yesterday -- I'd really like the Snowflake Mitts to be fliptop mittens, and in any case I'm going to need a pair of mitts much sooner than I'd be able to have the Snowflake Mitts finished.  So this afternoon I rummaged through my Cascade 220 stash -- and then through my Wool of the Andes stash -- and pulled out three colors that I think are going to work for the Lampwork Mitts.  I'll get started on that this week and might even get them done by the time our next cold snap comes in, which is supposedly early next week. (And given that I still have <i>one</i> of the Sunset Mitts, if I just get the first Lampwork Mitt done I'll at least have one for each hand.)</lj-cut>

Mom arranged with Lauren for our visit to Grandma to be at 2pm Xmas Eve.  I agreed to the Xmas Eve -- in fact, encouraged it -- but wasn't consulted on the time.  I have no idea how early I'll be getting home that morning or whether I'll get home and go straight to bed (as tends to happen when I get turned loose in the wee hours of the morning) or else get home at closer to my normal time and be going through a normal Thursday routine.  So I don't like being locked into an appointment for a day I can't plan in advance.

Also I pointed out to Mom that Xmas Eve is probably the most convenient time for the two of us to go see Star Wars together, since she's off that day and I'll definitely be in town.  I don't want to deal with the weekend crowd or be going on Monday when I've got a list of things to deal with. (Though I could work with Monday if Xmas Eve doesn't work out.) Hopefully I get home nice and early that morning, get some sleep, and then have the afternoon and evening to visit Grandma and go see a movie...

<lj-cut text=""Last week's mani"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Xmas%20Reds%202015.jpg"">

The decals were a different enough shade of red from the polish I used to be annoying.  Also, I didn't realize the white-on-red decal was really transparent-on-red until I peeled it up from the white card, so I had to switch which thumb I was about to put it on and throw my alternating color scheme off.  And the red-on-white decals (or rather, red-on-transparent) were crappy and started peeling from the tips very quickly.

<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Xmas%20Reds%202015%202.jpg"">

So the white decals applied to red polish looked good, and the striping-tape peppermint stripe. (At least until the nails got pressed against something before the layers had hardened all the way down.  I suspect it was when I went to sleep, which was hours after the last layer of polish was applied, and therefore somewhat discouraging.  But maybe it happened on the drive to Dad's instead.)</lj-cut>

Right.  I need to shuffle pictures into folders and run this final backup.  I suspect it'll take both more time than I need to be spending (in terms of getting in at least a nap before work tonight) and less time than I need (in terms of letting the final topcoat on my manicure dry before bed).</lj-cut>

"event","Reasonably successful visit with Dad. (I got there so late he was already in bed, so I just left my gear in the trunk and brought my purse with me into the house through the backyard and the back door.  Crashed in the guest room and woke up around the same time as Dad did the next morning.  Brought things inside, showered and changed, and settled in to an extended session of knitting in front of the TV.) Came home Thursday in the middle of the afternoon, got some knitting done (in my room, the TV's replacement power cable not having arrived), watched the last two eps of <i>The Knick</i> with Mom in her bedroom when she got home.  I had hoped to hit the gym before bed but didn't have the energy left, so instead I dragged myself to bed (much later than I should have gone) and went when I got up Friday morning.  Also repotted the red mini-roses and visited Grandma yesterday.  

Today's list involves a trip to pick up kitty litter and doing the dishes.  Not bad.  I would already be done with that by now, probably, had I not been on Ravelry consumed with important questions like, ""Which mitt or mitten pattern should I cast on for next week?,"" ""Do I have a size 3 circular needle available to cast on for the <a href=""http://www.garnstudio.com/pattern.php?id=4316&cid=17"">Winter Fantasy Socks</a>?"" and, ""Is the yarn I initially picked for the Winter Fantasy Socks too dark a blue?  Do I have a good alternate shade of blue in my stash?  In sufficient yardage for the project?"" (I'm going to ignore the actual pattern instructions and just work my standard toe-up kneesock, using the pattern's charting for the colorwork around the top.)

I got to work on time last night (and was out of work just a few minutes past the end of my shift this morning -- and that after spending ten minutes or so putting up snowflake ornaments on my cubicle) but there was the annoyance of my locker still being broken.  This is a thing which happened Sunday morning, where my locker was fine when I arrived and on my first break, but when I came back to the break room for my lunch it <i>would. not. open.</i> until after a good ten minutes of yanking and swearing and prying with the help of two coworkers. (The top of the door of the locker below mine showed gouge marks, and the metal piece the latches attached to was warped, so I'm guessing either the person in the other locker had the same problem before I did, or they caused my problem prying their own door open.) So I took my purse back to my desk for the last few hours of my shift and left a note on my supervisor's desk.  My locker wasn't fixed when I got in last night, so I stuck my lunch in the fridge, got my headphones out of my purse, and went back out to the car to stick my purse and coat in the trunk. (And had to use my trunk for a locker substitute for the rest of my shift.) My supervisor came by my desk midway through my shift to say that she hasn't heard back on my locker yet, and the relevant people may be out for the holiday -- so basically I'm going to be keeping my purse in my trunk for a while.

I was in a good mood leaving work this morning, aside from the locker thing -- but when I tried to put mitts on my cold hands for the drive to the Corner Bakery for breakfast, I discovered one of my <a href=""http://ravel.me/FyrDrakken/sm"">pink mitts</a> wasn't in the front pocket of my purse.  I drove a few blocks trying to remember when last I wore them and then doubled back to work to check the parking lot and break room.  Nope, but it could have been picked up and taken somewhere lost-and-foundish after I dropped it.  Or I could have dropped it at Dad's earlier this week. (I texted him to ask about it.  I can pick it up when I visit him at Xmas if he finds it for me.) 

This complicated the question of which hand covering I should knit for myself next, because the general idea was to do a set of flip-top mittens correcting the flaws of my <a href=""http://ravel.me/FyrDrakken/g1"">first pair</a> -- but that pair works well enough for now. (I wore them last night on the drive to work.) I seem to have given away all my other pairs of wrist-length mitts once I made the pink ones.  I do have a pair of <a href=""http://ravel.me/FyrDrakken/vvhmwvic2"">long mitts</a> in my purse, but then I'd be having to push my long sleeves back up my forearms, or see if they're loose enough to pull down over the mitts.  And I <i>am</i> still wearing a watch on my left wrist, which I'd just as soon not stretch a long cuff over.  If the pink mitt doesn't turn back up, I'll need to make another pair of short mitts soonish.

So which pattern on my queue to do?  I have a <a href=""http://www.knitpicks.com/patterns/Lunaria_Hooded_Scarf_&_Mitts_Set__D10684220.html"">Lunaria Hooded Scarf and Mitts</a> kit that I bought on sale a year or two back.  But I just wasn't feeling the love.  I got the pattern for the <a href=""http://www.knitpicks.com/cfPatterns/Pattern_Display.cfm?ID=41101220&media=RAV&utm_source=media&utm_medium=marketing&utm_campaign=RAV"">Lampwork Hat and Mitts</a> during KnitPicks' recent series of free downloads counting down to Xmas.  It's worsted weight, so it'd be a quick knit.  But it would also adapt to fliptop mittens very easily -- and more to the point, I'm in the mood for really fiddly colorwork lately, and that isn't too complicated.

What I finally settled on was this set of <a href=""https://dailyskein.wordpress.com/2008/04/30/post-ii-this-time-its-personal/"">Snowflake Mitts</a>, from the same pattern designer as the Lunaria set.  Fiddly and pretty -- and as the <a href=""http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/snowflake-fingerless-gloves-2/people"">other projects on Ravelry</a> demonstrate, it looks pretty damned good if you just work it in two colors.  <i>Or</i> if you work it in a solid color and a slow-color-shift yarn -- and while I was digging through the sockyarn bin to pull out the navy blue yarn for the Winter Fantasy Socks, I had a look at a ball of KnitPicks Chroma Fingering in <a href=""http://ravel.me/FyrDrakken/cf"">Roller Skate</a> that hadn't wowed me in the stash photo but looked pretty damned nice when I had it in my hand.

It was a very productive stash search.  I wasn't impressed by the yarn I'd earmarked for the Winter socks and went looking for some alternatives in a brighter shade of blue. (The shade I found myself really wanting to use was <a href=""http://ravel.me/FyrDrakken/os"">TARDIS Blue</a>, but I didn't have the yardage required.) I dug in the old sockyarn bin and pulled out a few skeins to compare in the sunlight -- plus a lovely shades-of-green to transfer to the new sockyarn bin so I'll see it when I'm contemplating what to knit next.  The original yarn idea for the Winter socks (KnitPicks Stroll Glimmer in <a href=""http://ravel.me/FyrDrakken/sg4"">Jay</a>) turned out to look better in the sunlight than in the semidarkened hallway -- and the silver sparkle was the deciding factor.  But the Cascade Heritage in <a href=""http://ravel.me/FyrDrakken/hs"">Cerulean</a> earned a transfer to the new sockyarn bin so I can find it more easily later.

So to sum up, I have a new set of kneesocks ready to cast on in the coming week, that'll be very plain sober dark blue until I reach the top third of the calf.  And I have a new pair of mitts ready to cast on, too -- that may wind up being fliptop mittens instead, if my missing mitt turns up before I get more than halfway up the hand...

I am not yet finished with <i>Daredevil</i>, in large part due to having quite a few other things to deal with yesterday and Thursday afternoon.  But the replacement power cord arrived today, and Mom hooked it up a little while ago.  So as soon as I come back from picking up a bag of kitty litter, I can park in the living room and watch another episode or two, until I need to head for bed. (Well, and do the dishes, and get my snack ready for tonight's first break.)

"event","Got out of work an hour early Sunday morning, amazingly enough.  Hit the gym, picked up a burger and a salad, got home and ate and crashed.  Woke up around 5 or 6pm and was pretty much up for the night.  

Got a few things off the DVR that had recorded the previous week, then made my grocery run.  Got home just as Mom was talking about going to bed, so I took over the living room.  Was just about to get started on the second season of <i>Penny Dreadful</i> -- the only thing I had left on the DVR -- and decided instead to get a Netflix disk watched so I could send it back and get <i>Only Lovers Left Alive</i> sent to me to watch later this week.  So after I finished that I switched from DVD to TV and discovered the cable had gone out.  And not only that -- the DVR was not showing most of the recordings Mom and I had left on it.  I wasn't sure if that would clear itself up when the cable signal was restored or if it had in fact been largely wiped.

But thankfully the Netflix streaming button on the TV remote worked just fine, so I decided it was a fine time to start <i>Daredevil</i>.  And I was up all damned night watching that, until I crashed in the early minutes of the sixth episode. (I am sad that I won't be home to finish the series and maybe move directly to <i>Jessica Jones</i> until Thursday.) I napped until noonish and then dragged through my Monday routine, not getting to the rabbit cage till Mom was home.  

I did get the cable signal back in the early afternoon (rebooting the router and the cable box) and verified that we had lost the several seasons of various shows Mom and I were planning to watch together at some point.  Also a lot of little incidental episodes that Mom had recorded and never gotten around to. (I was feeling moderately smug at having gotten so much of my own backlog off the DVR in recent weeks.) We can use On Demand or Netflix streaming to get most of what we wanted to marathon seasons of, though -- only <i>Justified</i> is out, since I don't have Amazon Prime and don't care enough about the show to pay to watch the season we missed seeing.

Mom and I tried to watch the the last couple of eps of <i>The Knick</i> (we had gotten caught up on the first part of the season and turned it into our regular Monday night TV show, but Mom went to play in a darts tournament last Monday) but the cable was glitchy as hell and kept stopping the playback.  I continue to blame the cable company and suspect it'll be fine by the time I'm home Thursday. (I think Mom said something about it being fine in her bedroom now, though it was giving her a lot of pixellation a few days ago.) But the other issue is that Mom discovered (while digging around behind the TV to check if the cable connections had been loosened by roaming cats) that Miss Amelia-Bun had managed to get back behind the TV stand and had nibbled at the TV power cord.  Mom came to my room to wake me up to complain about that, and wasn't a bit interested in hearing me tell her that Amelia squirming past the barriers I had set up on the one side of the TV stand had been an ongoing issue that I finally solved a few weeks ago.  She ordered me to get a replacement power cord, which is fair -- a pity there are so few electronics stores left in the area since the Best Buy closed and Radio Shack went under.  Wal-Mart is what there is left, and since they don't stock TV power cords (except as part of the package when you buy a new TV, of course) I had to order one online.  It would be nice if it arrived by the end of the week, but if not Mom and I are going to be doing our TV-watching in our rooms for a while.

<lj-cut text=""State of the knitting BEFORE getting to spend another three vacation days playing with sticks and string"">

Even if it's just my gym knitting project, it's still creeping along.  And now it's going to be the lazy-knitting project for when I don't have the time or attention span for anything fiddly...


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Lupin20.jpg"">

Hibernating now, until the next time I go see a movie. (Probably Star Wars with Mom at Xmas.)


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/SweetHeart5.jpg"">

Out of hibernation and progressing well.  This is what I worked on while watching Netflix Sunday night.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/BlueCatrionas13.jpg"">

Only a few rows of the toe, but there it is -- I have officially begun the second sock.  I want to get a fair bit done on <i>that</i> this week, as well.  I have some ideas for what I want to replace this project with once it's done.</lj-cut>

So this morning I had to do the vacuuming <i>and</i> go out seeking a TV power cord (and a nice tree skirt -- I decided to risk it on seeing that the cheap one Mom had bought remains intact, since the bunny who liked biting holes in fabric died early this year).  Late start on the computer -- and then I decided to get my lunch out of the way before starting my manicure.

Oh, and since last week I finally let Windows nag me into installing Windows 10, I've been slowed down by trying to learn to deal with the new system while going through my routine.  Very annoying.

<lj-cut text=""Green Xmas mani"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Xmas%20Greens%202015.jpg"">

The tree on the thumb was the only bit requiring striping tape and the bit I did last after the decals were done on all the other fingers.  And then I mangled it helping Mom rearrange things in the fridge...


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Xmas%20Greens%202015%202.jpg"">

Decals.  All decals.  The ones on the thumb look kind of blurry because they're from kind of a crappy set that was seriously hard to peel off the card without ripping them apart. (The little curvy wreath shape at the tip of the thumbnail looks a bit odd because the end of it <i>did</i> tear off, and I didn't do very well in sticking it on my nail to line up with the rest of the decal.)

Today is the red and white set, and the full-finger decals I used on several fingers were lovely aside from the bit where the white-on-red designs turned out to be in fact transparent-on-red and I had to put the one I used on a white-polished nail instead of a red one as I'd been planning.  So the alternating-red-and-white-nails color scheme was thrown off, and the red of the decals didn't match the shade of the red polish I'd used.  But aside from that, a generally acceptable result.  Only one striping-tape nail -- I felt compelled to include a candy cane stripe -- and it seems to have turned out well enough.</lj-cut>

It's later than I hoped to be leaving, but I did make a point of not just packing but loading my bags into the trunk of the car before I added the decals to my manicure.  I can basically hit post and head out the door. (Also I should probably try calling Dad to remind him that I was coming to visit this week.  I kept postponing that and now it's just a case of pulling out the phone to tell him I'm on my way.) 

Mom just got home a few minutes ago (having done a smidgen of Xmas shopping on the way home from work) and expressed astonishment that I'm still here.  But, not for long!</lj-cut>

"event","So the plan for the week was to rack up as much overtime as possible.  What actually happened was me getting nearly three hours over on Sunday morning, then being so damned tired every shift this week that I escaped as soon as my time was up.  I think I may have picked up an extra half hour on a morning or two. (No more tardies this week, at least.) Tonight is the last one before I have another five days in a row off.  I won't qualify for overtime in the morning, so I'd just as soon not have enough work tonight to have to stay late.  

We're starting to get into the pre-holiday slowdown -- and more to the point have hired more people in the last few weeks, so we won't be understaffed (unless a flu or something goes round, or unless we get a winter storm that keeps a lot of people home for a shift).  The last morning or two we had very little left to pass on to the day shift or roll over into the next night shift, and this morning there wasn't a whole hell of a lot of data entry left even though I bolted at 8:35. 

I had a headache all damned night, and by the latter half of my shift I was just counting the hours until I could escape. (And of course I had three or four people picking <i>me</i> to hand work to in that last hour, when I was just trying to finish what was on my desk and escape.) The drive home was pretty bad -- I was hurting <i>and</i> having a hard time keeping my eyes open -- and I took a micronap in the car as soon as I parked in front of the house before I could gather up and go in.  I let the bunnies out of their cage, plugged my phone in, took my earrings off, shut off the light, and got into bed.  Slept for three hours or so and woke up feeling <i>much</i> better. (Though the headache is starting to come back, and I hope I can shake it in the amount of time I have left for a nap before work.)

I have been short on sleep all damned week because I have been utterly unable to motivate myself to get into bed at a reasonable time.  Tuesday is understandable, but every day this week I've had plans to come home and take care of business and get ready for bed early -- possibly letting myself knit in front of the TV in my bedroom once I've gotten everything out of the way -- and wound up wasting time until I only have four or three or even two hours left to sleep in before work.

I'm not sure how much to blame on the last stretch of vacation days completely fucking up my sleep schedule and how much on this week's warm spell and the resulting pollen spike.  I have felt like shit for allergy-related reasons since Tuesday, and the sleep dep has just been adding to that.  I was so glad to reach today, with its forecasted rains coming in and washing the pollen from the air, and in the coming week the returning seasonal cold should be calming the plants the fuck down.

And I'm going to have to remember to bring the potted roses in on Tuesday before I leave to spend a few days visiting Dad.  Again I'm going to aim for coming home a day before I really have to so I can spend at least one day clearing the DVR.  I'm in good shape in terms of the ongoing weekly shows, but I'd love to go through that second season of <i>Penny Dreadful</i> while I have so much at-home time this month.

At least the week of not going to bed on time has been somewhat productive.  Yesterday I finished the toe on the second Lupin stocking, and this afternoon I put a few more rows of the main color on and then wove in all the loose ends.  Now it goes into hibernation until I need some movie knitting. (Probably when Mom and I go see the Star Wars movie on Xmas Eve or Xmas Day.) I pulled out the pink-and-black hearts sock today and put quite a few rows onto it.  That's going to be a lot of fun to work on.  And I need to start the second blue stocking so I can get rolling on that.  And pull that blue vest out of hibernation.  And I may make another pair of fliptop mittens for myself.  And pick out my next sock project.  

I'm going to spend the bulk of my visit to Dad knitting, but of course I'm going to wildly overestimate how much I'll actually get done over the course of two nights and two days.  Still, December is the month when I have enough free time to start making a real dent in these things...

"event","So today when I turned on my computer I finally decided to agree to the Windows 10 upgrade.  And it's making itself very inconvenient, insisting I either let it do its thing immediately or else schedule a time I can't amend or postpone.  I thought 8pm would be late enough, but I was running so late today that now I'm racing the clock to get my entry posted before I have to kick offline and let my computer do its thing. (Just in case, I stuck all the image links into the entry blank and posted it as a private entry, so I can finish it from my phone if I have to.)

So, yes.  The weekend got off to an awesome start when I put in nearly three hours of overtime at work.  A stop for breakfast and a trip to the gym -- and on my drive home I discovered I was missing an earring.  I decided to double back to the gym and search the parking lot, the path I'd taken back to my car, and the gym itself -- and I'm glad I did, since I found my earring at the base of the ski machine I'd been using.  Still, an annoyance and a waste of time.

So I got home exhausted and Mom was out putting up the outside lights and wanting my help.  I had basically no gas in the tank at that point and wound up doing very little.  Still, I helped get the netting up over the crape myrtles (and clean the mud off the kitchen chairs we had been using as stepstools afterwards).

<lj-cut text=""Our anemic lighting display"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Lights%201%20Sm.jpg"">

The bow around the (nonfunctioning) lightpost at the end of the walk is cute.  


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Lights%203%20Sm.jpg"">

I like the candy canes and the way all the lights used are rainbow chasers.  I wish we had something going out to the sides, though -- outlining the flower beds, if not the roofline.  I really wanted to stick netting on the crape myrtles at the outer corners of the house -- we had four nets, after all -- and then take some of the spare strands of lights we have around and wind them between the trunks of the trees.  But we would have needed to use an extension cord to join the nets, and the extension cords we have all have a big prong and a little one, and the netting's female connectors only work with a male connecter with equal-sized prongs.  I was tired and Mom wasn't enthusiastic about the prospect, so we stuck two nets on each of the trees bracketing the front door.  It looks very narrow.</lj-cut>

And also last week I got the tree dealt with.  <lj-cut text=""My share of the holiday decorating"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Bunnies%20under%20the%20tree%20Sm.jpg"">

I got the tree itself assembled and the lights on Wednesday before my doctor's appointment.  Here are Amelia and Stilinski adapting to the change in their environment.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Stockings%20Sm.jpg"">

And I got the stockings up.  The blue one with the snowflakes is my new one, the others are just kind of randomly assigned to Mom and Lauren and Lauren's family. (The Santa is Aidyn's, though, and Mom vaguely thought she's got a teddy bear stocking somewhere to be Axton's, but she has to find it when she gets around to decorating the living room.)


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Ornaments%202%20Sm.jpg"">

Setting out all the ornaments I'd be using.  First the unique individual ones go on, then snowflakes and icicles filling up the available spaces...


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Tree%203%20Sm.jpg"">

Finished result!  I realized we had no Star Wars ornaments -- had been vaguely regretful of not getting a Darth Vader ornament when I saw one at Wal-Mart months ago -- and since ThinkGeek's Star Wars sale was ending this week, Mom and I picked out a Vader and a C-3PO ornament -- and a pair of droid throw pillows, since ours are a bit pet-damaged...</lj-cut>

And there was prime knitting time while I was using vacation days.

<lj-cut text=""Things I got done when I wasn't Christmasing"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/PurpleVest17.jpg"">

Got the edging on!

<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/PurpleVest19.jpg"">

Apparently I gained some weight in the last year or two, since the buttons were under some strain. (Here I am holding my breath for the picture, since the top button had come undone on the previous attempt at a buttoned-up photo.) Fortunately I very rarely actually <i>close</i> my sweaters and coats and overshirts -- only when I'm getting cold enough to want every scrap of insulation I can get.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Lupin19.jpg"">

Let me just get the toe finished, the main color joined and the loose ends woven in, and this project is going into hibernation.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/PurpleTurquoise2.jpg"">

And now you can see where I'm going with this.  Might have been nice to have a brighter shade of purple, but I was just working from stash for this one.</lj-cut>

I anticipate very little knitting time in the coming week (barring the trips to the gym and to Grandma) since this is the only week this month in which I'll be eligible for overtime, and I intend to be scraping up every bit of it I can.  I have another five-day weekend coming up, and I'm sure the workload the last two weeks of the month is going to be light.  I can get through this week.

<lj-cut text=""Last week's mani delighted me"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Frozen.jpg"">

I had been planning royal blue with white or silver, but I saw Frozen again a couple of days before mani day and decided I liked the color scheme for Elsa's snow queen dress.  I was absolutely thrilled with the way the ombre turned out, and I suspect I'll be getting that pale aqua back out this summer for a mani with fish decals instead of snowflakes.

<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Frozen%202.jpg"">

A little bit of damage to the ring finger and pinky where the polish wound up shoved back from the tips slightly without me noticing.  I was able to spackle over the exposed white of the underlying nails, but couldn't do much to smooth out the wrinkles left where the polish got crinkled.  Still, that fell under the category of Things Only I Would Notice.

This week is the green Xmas mani.  I used two shades of green -- forest and neon -- and couldn't decide whether I preferred gold or white for the contrast color, so I went with both.

I was hoping to be a bit lazy this month and use a number of full-nail decals, but the most beautiful two sets of nail wraps I acquired were meant for nails longer than mine -- very interesting portions of the artwork would wind up being trimmed off to fit my nail length.  I'll try to refrain from cutting my nails this month and see what I've got to work with in another week or two -- but at least a couple of the sets I got were simple repeated designs that looked good with my current nail length, so I was able to use a single nail wrap this week. (There's a whole set of red and white, which is next week's color scheme.)

Still, very many decals, and I was able to get most of my manicure finished some time ago.  There was only one finger using striping tape, and I was unsure whether dealing with it would put me over the time limit for getting off the computer in time to satisfy Microsoft -- but I really wanted to give it time to dry as much as possible before bedtime. (Especially since I didn't take the time to get ready for bed earlier, not realizing how close I'd be coming to the time limit with computerage yet to deal with.) So I did that thumb and now the final round of topcoat is drying and I hope I'll be able to avoid mangling it while changing for bed -- but at least it's got a bit longer to harden before I'll be putting it in danger.</lj-cut>

Roses are generally doing well.  The red mini roses are still thriving, with new leaves on all four plants.  The full-sized ones are all doing more or less okay -- though most are showing signs of black spot, and I need to upgrade from neem oil to something that works better before spring.  The three pink roses that seem likely to survive the repotting are still showing green leaves but no new growth as yet.  I snipped that final bud off the Blue Girl a day or two ago and it's very slowly opening now that it's inside where it's warm.  And of course we're getting a warm week, so the final bud on the Perfume Delight is starting to open and I'll cut it in a few days.

And, right.  Just enough time left to post this, double-check my proofing, and get off the computer...</lj-cut>

"event","Tuesday night I hit the gym before bed and slept late the next morning.  But I still had time to assemble the tree and get the lights onto it before leaving for my appointment.

I'd never been formally assessed for allergies or asthma or whatever, so there was a whole list of things to be done.  A chest x-ray and some sort of lung capacity test while I was there, an appointment to come in next month and get checked for reactions to a range of allergens, and an order to present at the testing facility a building away to get a smidgen of bloodwork done.  I was told the scheduler was needed to set me up for the overnight sleep apnea test but since she was out she would be calling me up on Friday. (She did not.) I tried to get my blood work done before leaving but they were already closed.  So I went to visit Grandma and then came home, largely satisfied with my day but too tired to get the ornaments on the tree.

Thursday I got myself up and running, headed out to get my blood test (and pick up a bag of hay at Petco to tide the bunnies over till I could get a box of hay at the rabbit sanctuary today), then came home and got the ornaments on the tree. (Very systematically -- first the uniquely chosen random ornaments accumulated over the years, largest to the bottom and smallest to the top, then the glittery snowflakes and icicles evenly spread across the tree.) And then after lunch came the Xmas cards.  I used up the last of the stamps from last year and got as many cards into the mailbox as I could, then stuck the rest in my purse and finished the evening knitting.  I think that's when I bound off the ribbing on my Lupin Stocking -- as soon as I finish the toe of the second, that project goes back into hibernation until I need something easy and simple to work on.

Friday was a trip to the post office and another visit to Grandma. Then home to finish marathoning the entire season of <i>Doctor Who</i> I'd been letting stack up on the DVR while working on my purple vest.  It took a lot of experimentation and false starts to get an edging that satisfied me, and once I had it I kept going till I'd gone all the way up one side and just past the neck seam.  So I didn't get much sleep before work last night.

Today I didn't have too much on the list to deal with, at least.  A trip to the rabbit sanctuary and finishing the edging on the vest -- so now the bunnies have hay for another few weeks and the new vest can go in Monday's laundry and be ready to wear for the next real cold snap.  Not much time left to nap before tonight's shift -- and since next week is the only chance I'll have in the entire month to pick up some overtime, I'm expecting to be there late tomorrow morning.  And then comes the gym, and after that instead of getting to crash I'm probably going to be helping Mom get the lights up outside the house. (Thankfully we don't put any on the roof since Mom doesn't want to get up there and I flat out refuse to do so.  Just in the trees and bushes, and bordering the front walk on rows of candy-cane-striped poles.)

The full-sized roses seem to be largely dormant now.  The new leaves on the Snowfire are still very red, and the final bud on the Perfume Delight and the lone bud on the Blue Girl aren't opening. (I may cut the one off the Blue Girl and bring it in next week to see if it blooms in a vase in a warm house.) Happily, the black spot seems not to be making any great inroads.

The mini red roses are rejoicing in the sunlight, with several of the plants showing new growth and no signs of dormancy. (I think I've got two vigorous plants in that shared pot and two that may not be enjoying being crowded out so much.)

The pink roses are still struggling after being repotted.  I made the mistake of not refreshing my memory on advice for repotting minis until <i>after</i> having done so, and so was dismayed to learn that adding fertilizer to the potting soil was not recommended until the roots have had time to establish themselves in the new pot.  So I don't know for sure if the outbreak of yellowing leaves is because of overfertilization or because the windowsill I put them in for ""indirect sunlight"" for the week after transplanting was in fact much too dark for them.  I started putting them outside again during the day on Tuesday or Wednesday, and gave them some significant watering a couple of times this week in the hopes of leaching some of the fertilizer out.  

We're supposed to have warmer weather (comparatively) in the next week, so last night was the last time I brought the trio of mini rose pots inside for a while.  I'll leave them outside for a few days so they can get started on enjoying the morning sunlight before I'm home (or awake) to take them out into it.  No repotting the red until I know for sure how many of the pink roses have survived the ordeal.  

I'm pretty sure one is dying, but it was only a lackluster couple of twigs when I transplanted it and I had little hope for it to begin with.  It doesn't help that one of the cats apparently tried to use that pot as a litterbox last night or this morning before I got home from work and in the process of peeing in it pushed that little twiglet over on its side.  If two out of the four pink roses survive till spring I'll count myself satisfied -- and three of them are still fighting.  I think the yellow in some of their leaves is darkening back to green.  There has been some withering and drying on this branch or that, but there are still green leaves and a few healthy blooms.  I watered them today and put their pots in the wrought-iron holder to slowly drip and drain and dry in the sun.  Water and sunlight and hope.

But at least I've gotten my Xmas obligations taken care of, and with no worries about getting Xmas knitting done I can enjoy my upcoming time off and the expected shorter shifts leading up to Xmas.  I've got several projects that have been in hibernation for a few months, and I'm kicking around ideas for my next pair of socks.  And once I get the second season of <i>Penny Dreadful</i> off the DVR, it's down to stuff I need to watch with Mom or she needs to get rid of without me. (Meaning I can be more chill about spending a few days at Dad's house watching reality TV about Alaskans and game wardens and whatever else, with my full DVR at home where I can't get to it.)

Aargh, the time.  Tonight is going to drag and tomorrow is going to be <i>exhausting...</i>

"event","I have been very off-schedule this weekend -- partly because I got out of work 3am Sunday morning and came home and went to bed.  Then I was up and around and caught up on sleep and had vague plans for the day -- but I came home from the gym with a meal to eat and a book I wanted to finish reading, and Lauren and her boys were in the house.  So I ate and read and hung out in the kitchen until they went home, and then it was late and I was starting to get tired again and just didn't want to mess with moving furniture around, let alone getting the tree up.  So instead I stayed up and read till I finished the book and went to bed with a headache. (Probably at least partly from caffeine withdrawal.)

Slow start Monday and today both.  I deliberately postponed the Grandma visit to today because I knew I wasn't going to have to go to work tonight -- but I wound up taking so long getting online and dealing with my manicure that suddenly I had sticky nails and no time left to go see Grandma before she was likely down for the night.  So, tomorrow -- on the way to the gym, say. (I was also supposed to get the vacuuming done yesterday so I could move furniture with Mom last night, but I got home from the grocery store later than hoped and it was cold and rainy out and I didn't want to have to go outside to dump the cage trash and the bunny box.  Especially with cats begging to be let outside who would be trying to escape every time I opened the door.  So, this morning, which turned out to be early this afternoon.)

Some knitting took place over the holiday weekend, though I'm hoping for even more in the next few days...

<lj-cut text=""Some endings and beginnings"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/RedBlack30.jpg"">

I did the colorwork band on the left sock on a larger size needle than the rest of the sock.  Then on the second sock I forgot to change needles, so the colorwork band is a bit shorter when I have the sock on.  Not uncomfortable and it'll be hidden under my pants, so I didn't think it was worth the trouble of redoing it. (Especially since that would involve unpicking a bindoff and frogging ribbing and colorwork alike.) I put a big note in my pattern for this kind of sock to remind me to use size 4s for the colorwork next time.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/PurpleTurquoise1.jpg"">

Speaking of next time, here's the toe for the next pair I'll make using the same pattern as the red-and-black striped pair.  A different color scheme, and a different pattern for the colorwork around the top, but I'll pick that out when I get there.  And I've got a couple more color schemes in mind for my next few pairs of striped socks...


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Lupin18.jpg"">

About halfway through the ribbing.  This is what I was planning to work on when I visit Grandma -- and when I'm waiting during tomorrow's doctor visit.</lj-cut>

So tomorrow I have the usual Wednesday stuff -- plus a doctor's visit and a visit to Grandma.  But at least I won't be coming home from work exhausted after just a few hours of sleep the night before -- and I won't have to be getting myself into bed for work tomorrow night, either.

Mom and I made the annual Swiss Colony order last night, which concludes my Xmas shopping for this year (aside from e-books for Dad, which can wait till right before Xmas).  After I get offline Mom and I are going to move the sideboard out of the way to make room for the Xmas tree (I already moved the cat tree over to the other side of the room earlier this afternoon) and bring the tree box in from the garage.  I'll get the tree up and decorated probably tomorrow or Thursday, and the same for sending out my Xmas cards.  No Xmas knitting this year, so that basically covers all my added seasonal obligations until time for wrapping gifts.

And <i>that</i> is why I like using up a few days of vacation time early in December.  No competition for the days off, and it gives me free time to take care of a few things so I can kick back and enjoy the season without that constant nagging feeling of having <i>things</i> I still haven't taken care of.

<lj-cut text=""Successful Thanksgiving mani"">
<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Thanksgiving%202015.jpg"">

One of the things that pleased me about this manicure was the way the decals turned out to be fairly close to the four colors I was using for the added detailing.  The left thumb wasn't the effect I was trying for -- a starburst effect over half the nail -- but the problem was that I realized I could use two colors, and then I had so many little segments I could do three or even four colors, and then I couldn't decide how to portion them out among the shades and thought using the gold base color to separate them would work -- only the gold wound up overpowering the other colors because it was the color under the striping tape as well as in the segments I didn't fill in.  Should have just picked two colors, or maybe used the bronze as the color interspersed with the other two or three shades used.  At least it didn't look awful -- a bit like turkey feathers, really -- and I added a decal to make the nail look less bare.


<img src=""http://hotlinks.fyrdrakken.net/Thanksgiving%202015%202.jpg"">

And the right hand went well.  A bit of smudging at the tip of the middle finger that I spackled over with more bronze, but aside from that a very successful job.

Today's mani is an ombre of pale to bright aqua with snowflake decals and a lot of glitter.  I was planning on silver and royal or bright blue for a snow-themed mani this week, but seeing <i>Frozen</i> again a few days ago put me in the mood for the color scheme of Elsa's snow queen dress.</lj-cut>

Thanksgiving went well enough.  I was expecting to get out of work early but enough people had taken the night off that I wound up clocking out just a few minutes past the end of my shift.  So I came home and spent an hour or so -- having breakfast, giving the bunnies hay and water, gathering up my knitting, probably one or two other things I wanted to take care of before heading out.

It was an excellent meal and a nice afternoon spent hanging out with family.  My cousin and her family had driven up from Louisiana -- including the older daughter, who I hadn't seen in person for years since she prefers to do Thanksgiving with her dad's side of the family and avoid the longassed drive. (We have each other friended on Facebook, though -- I see a fair bit of her sorority activities.) This time she was here to show off her boyfriend.  Lauren was also there, with husband and kids, to my surprise.  I dodged her husband as much as possible, though I had to hear a little bit of him sharing conspiracy theories and racist ranting.  

I think I got in a little nap in the middle of the afternoon, enough to feel comfortable with driving home. (Mostly I wanted to wake up at home in my own bed and not have to get myself up and moving and then <i>drive home</i> before I could get started on doing anything with my Friday.  I also wanted to be sure I could sleep for hours and not be woken up by Dad at 2am turning on the TV.  Then I wound up being woken up by Mom so I could go move my car out of the way of the city workers who were there to collect the logs and branches of the pear tree that had been cut down a week ago.)

The food was splendid, and in the early evening I attacked the desserts.  Slices of two pies and a strawberry cake.  And that was that -- I pigged out for one day and didn't even ask for any leftovers to bring home. (Mom got some leftovers from her sister's but I didn't like the looks of most of it, aside from the rolls.) I got a bit of turkey at the store to use in sandwiches for the next week or two because I'm little bit in the mood for the post-feast turkey-with-mayo sandwich I never got, but that's about it for my Thanksgiving.

Oh, and the day before Thanksgiving I took the pot of pink roses and attempted to repot them into two of the big ceramic planters.  They've been sitting on the ""greenhouse"" window in the kitchen since then (at the suggestion of the most authoritative instructions I saw, calling for indirect light for a week or two afterwards), though this afternoon I stuck them outside for a bit of more direct sun because I was getting worried.  Some limpness and some yellowing of the leaves on a few of the plants -- one of them was in pretty miserable shape before the transplanting and has since dropped all its leaves, barring some very tiny new ones.  If three of the four survive the transplanting I'll be reasonably satisfied.  The red roses are waiting at least another week or two while I see if the pink roses survive -- if not, I'll do further research and adjust my technique. (The red roses include two very sturdy plants showing new growth, and two others that are doing less well.  I'll make a point of sticking one strong plant and one weaker one in each pot.)

Still haven't heard from my boss on how close I am to losing my job for an excessive number of tardies.  Was late another time last week, though. (Left the house on time, but it was raining and a weekend night, so there was more traffic on the road near midnight than usual, and much of it creeping along in terror of the rainslick freeways.  And I wound up taking the longer route to work, because the traffic app warned that there was a slow section on the shorter path.)

Right.  Need to post this and get my backup running...</lj-cut>

"event","Two short shifts at work after Thanksgiving, with me getting to clock out at 3am both Friday and Saturday nights.  There was some extra sleep when I got home, and I seem to vaguely recall productivity on Saturday after I woke back up.  Today I had <i>plans</i> to get a jump on the Monday ""to do"" list, but what actually <i>happened</i> was me catching up on sleep, watching <i>Frozen</i> while doing a bit of knitting, and going to the gym.  

The idea had been to get the Xmas tree up today, but Mom invited Lauren to visit with the kids.  So when I got home from the gym, they were here, and it was already dark out, and I had picked up a burger and salad on the way home, and I just wanted to read at the kitchen table and not be sociable or have to move furniture and clean up the spot where the tree goes.

So tomorrow I'll clear away the bunny corner and move the cat tree in the course of my usual Monday cleaning, and then when Mom gets home we can move the sideboard.  With the area cleared, I can deal with the tree myself in the next few days -- after all, I took three nights off in the coming week, so I'll have the time...

"event","So I went to visit Dad for a few days.  He was getting over bronchitis -- allergies, not a cold, he was very sure -- and was in bed napping when I arrived.  

<lj-cut text=""Visiting Dad"">I arrived to a dark and apparently empty house with no response to my knock and doorbell ring, so I fought my way past the bush guarding the gate into the backyard, came in through the always-unlocked back door, unlocked the front door so I could bring my bags in from the car, and then crossed the yards to knock on my uncle's door and ask if Dad was over there.  I thought the house was empty and assumed first that Dad was probably at his brother's, or if not then at the grocery store, but my uncle said he was home and I realized he must be in bed.  I napped a bit (on the bed in the guest room, still fully dressed and with the lights on) and then Dad woke me up walking past in the hallway.  I said hi and goodnight to him, brushed my teeth and sacked out for something like ten hours of sleep.

So Wednesday I had plenty of energy and Dad was unshaven and in a bathrobe for most of the day.  He said we'd go to Brookshire's for a grocery run and to pick up some sandwiches -- just as soon as he'd taken another brief nap -- and if I'd realized that even after he was awake he'd spend another few hours in the chair in front of the TV, I'd have just gone to Sonic as soon as he went down for his nap.  I wound up going there to pick up a late lunch when it became apparent he wasn't moving anytime soon, and I became very glad I'd had the forethought to bring three full bottles of water with me. (I cannot stand the taste of the tap water in that town to begin with, and seeing how visibly filthy the water was coming out of Dad's kitchen tap when he first moved in set me against the idea of drinking it unfiltered.  I'll use it for tea or to brush my teeth with, though.) 

I spent the afternoon unable to really settle to doing much of the knitting I'd brought with me, expecting to be leaving momentarily and having to drop what I was doing. Finally after 4pm we went to the drugstore (getting Benadryl for Dad, and a sixpack of water for me) and the grocery store.  I finally kicked off my sneakers for the cushy knit houseboots I'd brought with me (bought a few weeks ago because I gave up on the idea of ever getting around to finishing knitting my own) and settled down to knit for the rest of the evening.

Dad is on a very weird sleep schedule now.  He naps when he gets tired and then is up at random hours, unable to sleep for more than a few hours at a stretch.  This is a problem when I'm trying to sleep just on the other side of the wall from the living room and he turns up the volume on the TV he's watching at 3am.  I got a few hours of sleep Wednesday night and then he woke me up around 1am and I couldn't get back to sleep until past dawn, well after he'd gone back to bed.

Thursday morning I sat with Dad in front of the TV for a few hours.  He was much perkier with the Benadryl and a lot of coffee -- actually fully dressed and raring to go.  But we didn't do anything but watch TV (and knit or drink beer in our respective cases) and then I left around noon.

It feels like every time I visit Dad it's a long list of complaints -- at least now there's a shower curtain and handsoap and a trashcan in the guest bathroom, but there were no bathtowels, it was down to the last roll of toilet paper, and the shower doesn't drain unless you stand there with a finger on the button controlling the stopper while the scummy water surrounding your ankles slowly recedes.  The countertops were filthy, the couches had so much stuff on them there was just room for a single seat on each (and no stretching out, and I kept knocking clean laundry from the heap next to me onto the floor), the guest bedroom has slats sticking out from the sides of the bedframe to gouge the unwary calf (and no bedside table, let alone a lamp on it, meaning I'm turning out the overhead light from the door and then making my way to the bed in the dark), and Dad has fairly crappy cable (and we have vastly dissimilar viewing tastes).</lj-cut>

So this is why when I have a cluster of days free to visit Dad I tend to mislead him about how soon I have to be back at work and give myself the last night of my vacation time back home.  And I'm using the doctor's appointment in my next block of days off as an excuse not to visit, even though I could go down later Wednesday afternoon after I'm done with my appointment and spend a couple of nights there.  But no, I'd rather stay home to clear the DVR, set up the Xmas tree, and perhaps get my Xmas cards out of the way.

In other news, my uncle was originally supposed to come by this afternoon to deal with the fallen tree section, but instead is coming tomorrow.  This means I'll be on hand to lend my minimal amount of muscle to hauling and clearing limbs and branches -- and fuss over the fate of my imperilled roses. (Which at least are getting <i>some</i> sunlight each day, even shaded by the tree leaning overhead.)

Oh, and while I was in Brookshire's with Dad we passed by a display of festive plants for the holiday season -- including a whole bunch of minature roses in different colors.  Thursday on the way out of town I made a special point of returning to Brookshire's to fill up my gas tank, grab a drink and a snack for the road -- and grab one red rose and one bright pink.

I brought them home and set them on the patio table in the backyard.  My planning was to keep them in the pots they came in until spring and then plant them in the ground somewhere that appeared to be suitable.  But I worried about the wind blowing them over or a cat knocking them over, if I left them sitting on the table for months (barring bringing them inside during freezing weather, as I've done for tonight).  

And then I noticed a set of ceramic pots hanging from a metal frame, which Mom had mentioned wanting to find something small to plant in.  I set the roses in the top two ceramic pots (still in their original plastic pots, just resting inside the larger planters) just to get them safely out of the way, and then I considered how well they seemed to fit.  And yes, I can lift the ceramic pots out of the metal frame, to bring them inside.  So now I'm thinking in terms of getting a bag of potting soil on my next trip to Wal-Mart and transferring the wee roses to the ceramic planters in the next few days.  Counting the number of stems coming out of the soil, I might actually have multiple small plants with the same color of blooms crowded into each pot.  Depending on whether the root masses seem to be separable or just one great mass, I could conceivably split them up into four ceramic pots instead of just a pair, filling the set of planters and giving the roses more room to grow healthily.

In knitting news, the purple vest has buttons now, and today I dug out my various knitting stitch guides and encyclopedias to see what they had on doing edgings.  I found a really clear guide on doing a simple crocheted edging, and I can get online to refresh my memory on i-cord, and see which seems to go better with the slipped-stitch front edges in bulky yarn.  I bound off the first blue stocking, and I'll probably save casting on the toe for my next visit to Grandma.  And earlier this evening I started the ribbing on the second red-and-black stocking.  

I am down to the backup sock in my purse in terms of gym knitting -- and I'm nearly to the ribbing of that, too.  I was planning to replace the red-and-black stockings with the pink-and-black colorwork heart socks in my active projects rotation, but I'm going to need something else I can work on at the gym.  I suspect I should spend my Thanksgiving knitting time getting the purse sock finished and casting on the toe of the second sock of the pair, since it's better than nothing -- but the yarn responds badly to being held in sweaty fingers, and I should maybe get the turquoise-and-purple pair started as soon as the red-and-black pair is bound off.

And, right.  Happily I took an unplanned nap earlier this afternoon, since I have only a couple-three hours left to sleep in before work...</lj-cut>

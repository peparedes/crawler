Except that Sirius could have just TOLD me that we were going to babysit his cousin. She's one of those spoiled Black family ankle-biters with the permanent pout and the eyes that bore INTO YOUR SOUL. She's maybe five or so. She's got a Corgi that she tugs around by the collar all day. Its name is Tuddy. Uh. Guess she named him herself.

Guess who got to clean little Nymphadora up when she got into a mud puddle?

""Remus, you do it.""

""No, she's your cousin.""

""So, you're the guest.""

""I'm here purely against my will, Sirius.""

""Nonsense, you love spending time with me at my lovely home. Now mop up my cousin.""

Bloody hell in a handbasket.

Bye."

The motorbike.

I doubt I'll ever have a quiet moment to myself again, not with that rumbling monstrosity flying about the grounds. And Dumbledore allows it. Good grief. 

I'm not feeling well. Not at all. Ah well.

Sirius has got hold of Peter's underwear. Must break them up. Must magically retrieve underwear from bottom of lake. Must reprimand Padfoot for being a wanker. 

I have a headache. 

Does a poor seventh year catch no breaks?"

"event","Sirius punched James.

Hard.

This wasn't playful or innocent. This was teenage hormones blowing up into pure and utter rage. It was scary.

Here's the story:

I had only been at the Potters for a few days. From there I was going to go to King's Cross and all that. But Sirius, who had run away a month before, seemed to be getting on James's nerves, and vice-versa. What had been a perfectly normal debate about with Ravenclaw girl would be dateable, turned into mayhem - right in the sitting room, too. I mean, I literally had to wade in and break them up. Bloody hell. 

James was dazed, but Sirius was reeling, and I knew he might let another one fly at me, so I pushed James down and moved to restrain him. He hurled himself toward me and caught my head. He threw me down and stormed outside.

Lucky his parents weren't home. 

Again, bloody hell."

But maybe I'll give it a second chance :)

Sirius is, as usual, trying to kill me. Kill me, I tell you. Just by his words. ""Remus, I'm coming with you. Yes, Remus. Remus, I am coming with you. Hey, Moony, want me to come with you...?"" 

God.

The next full moon is on the 3rd of September - nothing better than a transformation 3 days into the new term!

I'm going to give this a rest till tomorrow. There WILL be more ranting, trust me.

"event","Broken wrist, scraped up thigh, bloodied ear, scratched up face - and those are just Padfoot's injuries. I, most unfortunately, fared worse; much, much worse.

But I think I'm sufficiently rested up since the full moon. Still look like death warmed over, no doubt, but that's hardly news. Madam Pomfrey took care of my broken ribs and leg, which snapped like a twig when Prongs sent me into a tree - details elude me, but perhaps that's a good thing. Apparently I was hot on the trail of some beautiful maiden in Hogsmeade who was picking flowers, and I wasn't after her to seduce her, or so Sirius says. 

I missed so much class, I have to lock myself in the dormitory and work during every spare moment. I have been graciously relieved of my prank-pulling duties because of it, and I must say, I needed the reprieve. Peter's always a little apprehensive when he takes over my usual lookout position, but, hey, he's learned from the best. Hopefully the teachers will forget to dock points when they see him stutteruing so helplessly. Poor bloke.

In other news, Lily Evans is on the war path. Yes, it seems that someone *hint hint, wink wink* has sent her several large flowers whose species is currently unidentified, so Lily refuses to touch them. While the sender, whom I know personally, insists that the flowers are harmless, he did let slip that they weren't entiely nonmagical. Hm... I very subtly and tactfully reminded him that Love Potions were illegal, especially when sent in the form of beautiful flowers, but the 'sender' simply adjusted his glasses and slipped away in a huff. 

Oh well.

Sirius is having a bit of a botched memorial service for his owl, Humphrey, who has been declared ""missing in action"" she - yes, she - hasn't turned up in four and a half months since Padfoot sent her on a simple trip to Hogsmeade. There was much weeping and I was forced *ahem* I mean, compelled to extend my sincerest sympathies to Mr. Black, although I fear he was too busy crying to hear me. His wailing attracted much attention from the Care of Magical Creatures class, which was being held mere yards away. Sirius simply wiped his tears and yelled, ""OY! MY OWL'S DEAD! SHOW SOME SYMPATHY, YOU BASTARDS!"" then he ran back up to castle in a blaze of melodramatic glory.

Ah, the perks of being a Marauder.

This just in, I have lost my voice.

Damn. It. 

I honestly can't speak, so this remains my only means of communication to anyone. Oh, joy. Someone get the poor werewolf a cough drop! Wait, should I type that? Haha... Erm, inside joke, eh?

Okay, I'm going to go eat something very salty to help my throat. I'm sure the house elves will be happy to oblige. The question is, can I really be arsed into walking down seven flights of stairs to the kitchen, and then spending a half hour playing charades until the elves finally understand the message that I'm trying to convey to them? Perhaps I'll get Peter to do it.

Cheers, pray for me,
Moony"

"event","Sirius just relayed a message from Lily - She told Mandy who told Alice who told Frank who told that Gudgeon bloke who told Blake who told Nevan who told his girlfriend who told Courtney who told Sirius. So now all of Hogwarts probably knows that Lily thinks ""James's glasses suit him.""

Yes. That's it. But it's a breakthrough as far as Potter is concerned.

Sirius woke me up at 3:00 this morning. He and James literally dragged me down to the common room, out the portrait hole, down roughly seven flights of stairs to first floor, and ALL THE WAY to the entrance to the Slytherin common room; My half-awake body was hardly functioning at that obscene hour, so I simply let them haul me along. 

""Okay.""

""Okay what?""

""Shh.""

""What are we doing?""

""Evil.""

""Damn it.""

It was then that Sirius conjured up the key to this whole great grand exploit. A sign that said, in large spirally red letters, ""Slytherin House is a Brothel.""

""Oh, that'll come as a shock.""

Well, the Slytherins weren't too happy. Especially when Sirius handed Snape a blue silk shirt, said, ""This ought to make your customers happy,"" then walked away without another word. What a day.

Peter's ill. If his cold doesn't die, then I'll have company *happy happy joy joy, right?* in the hospital wing tomorrow.

Yay.

Ugh. Tomorrow's the big day. Ouch, this will not be pleasant. Already broke my wrist last week, and it's still feeling a bit stiff. Probably fall off after tomorrow."

We were in Muggle Studies, and our teacher, Mrs. Micklethwaite, was describing an essay that we are expected to write by the end of term about a certain topic in Muggle History - you know, World Wars, Economic disasters, et cetera, and James immediately raises his hand and volunteers to do The Industrial Revolution. Sirius, without missing a beat, says ""Why, hoping to find out why your machinery *raised eyebrows suggestively* isn't working correctly?"" James flew over two desks and just punched Sirius in the head. And, see, you could tell that no one was home in Sirius's brain for a minute there, and then Sirius just pulls back and well... James's glasses took a beating, let's leave it at that.

Damn oranges. Don't try and peel them. They'll just let you down. Squirt you right in the eye. Never fails.

"event","God, it's mad in Gryffindor tower. The only reason it isn't in smoldering ruins is because Sirius and James are in detention, but everyone else is making quite enough mayhem by themselves. I've been sleeping for half an hour and now my brief lack of consciousness has come back to bite me in the arse in the form of a two foot Transfiguration essay. Honestly, can't McGonagall give us an extra week for our thesis? It counts enough in our grade, we might as well be able to complete it without stressing ourselves into hysterics.

Peter is sitting by the fire with a few pretty sixth year girls, trying his best to be sympathetic as one of them is crying. One can only imagine why. It's either stress or the abrupt loss of a boyfriend. I suspect the latter.

Ah, James's owl Brom is back. And I see he has returned from the Potters' house emptyhanded despite his owner's pathetic plea for extra Hogsmeade money. I can't help smirking; James poked himself in the eye so that he could artistically smear teardrops all over the letter he sent to his parents, but obviously they saw through his facade.

Oh, bloody hell, it's raining again! We're all going to drown.

Time to go. I'm procrastinating as it is. My thesis is... staring at me.

ok well i was in Minocqua the island city up north almost in canada well i stayed in extra 5 days with my cousin collin and patsy his mom well then he has a sister there both adopted and we had to pick her up omfg she is annoying:highlight-burb relif-she has ring tones on her cell and one is the burp relif it was funny but she kept playing it over and over

highlight:the drinking-i drank yea qa sip of beer and alittle more then half a bottle of Mikes Hard Lemanade which is 5.2% alchol but collin was so drunk omg 

high light:the conoes-okay this one omg well collin is realy cute and i flirt with him alot and he flirts with me 2 but anyways we went out on conoes i went with patsy and collin went with his sister rebacca and it was so windy the waves omg it was scary and me and patsy were following collin and rebacca and we all were fight ing the waves but when were fighting the waves you have to be carefull and make sure the waves dont push you to the side or youll tip over but collin and rebacca were doing good but me and pasty turned around and went with the waves we got a search boat i was freeking out but didnt show it patsy freeked out and did show it i didnt care abouit rebacca just collin but we found them

highlight:saving a fish-weird yes butwe were fishing and rebacca caught a fish and wanted to keep it but it swolled the hook we brought it up to camp and me and collin stayed and rebacca went back fishing and me and collin were trying to get the hook out and then rebbacca came back and said are you guys tormenting my fish? we said were trying to get the hook out or it gonna die so we give the fish and thje twezers to rebbacca we get the hook out get a plastic bag and fill it with water and run the fish down to the water and let it go

highlight:uncle rich's accident-my umcle rich aunt shelly carlie and sam were stayting at fence lake in minocqua and my uncle rick went skiing and fell off summer salted in the water landed on the neck and waved his armas to get the boat back but he realized only one arm was up and he was trying to get both arms up and his arm got some type of nereve damage but we hoped the nerves are brosed because then the fealing cold come back or if it dasmaged the fellin will never come back and his arm will be paralized for life

highlight:jim pecks-jim pecks is this wild life zoo place with deer that you can pet it was cool thats all i can say

highlight:the racoons-there were racoons trying to get in are food and me colllin and rebacca were up and all these racoons were arouind at first there were cute but then it was rock throwing time lol

highlight:wrstling- not much to this one but me and collin were watching wrestling and this dude with a microphone goes up and smacks a wrestler in the head with the microphne and knocks him out

highlight:cheese burgers-ok the big flirting with my cousin we were watching toomraiders and collin said shes hot she has the abs the hair the boobs and umm im not sure about the butt i said a butt like this so i roll over on my bed and smack my butt and he said no ur but is as flat as this wall i said no you must be looking in the mirror he sad no these are chesse burgers ur are hambagers it was funny"

                         I lay on my bed with your picture in my hand staring at you thinking that i may have a possibility of keeping you. The picture is for me to remember you by.Wondering and thinking in my head why did this happen why did we happen?why couldnt I get over you? I wanna call you to ask if you kept on gonning out with me because you had me wrapped around your fingers and i would do anything if you told me to? peopple told me that you did by who am i to believe them for I wouldnt be me if i didnt wonder and if I were to listen to them with no thought.(i sound like Shakespare).

Cool 

It's hard to remember how it felt before
Now I found the love of my life...
Passes things get more comfortable
Everything is going right

And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool

We used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain

Remember Harbor Boulevard
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown
We have changed but we're still the same
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool 

And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles, and now we're hangin' out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been
I know we're cool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gwen Stefani 
Crash 

Back it up, back it up
You got it, you got it
Put your hands up, put your hands up
You got it, you got it
Drive back baby to me fast in your car
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard

I wander 'round the room and I'm getting things ready
I picture you driving just like Mario Andretti
I got the cush, Kettle One, waiting for your engine
Your Grand Prix attention, it's gonna be a party 

Don't forget to make a U-turn
I see you left your blinker on
I got it rolled and ready here to burn
Meet me back at home 

Drive back baby to me fast in your car
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard

Driving fast in your car
I've got you tracked on my radar

It's just such a trip how you're still my speed racer
You got me so addicted just like a free baser
I want you all over me like L.A.M.B.
So get here A.S.A.P. it's gonnna be a party

Don't forget to make a U-turn (don't forget to get here)
I see you left your blinker on (you see I want to get it on)
I got it rolled and ready here to burn
Meet me back at home (you know you need me so come back)

Drive back baby to me fast in your car
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard

Now you know you're qualified
You're in the pole position
Put it in first gear, step on the pedal and drive fast

Back it up, back it up
You got it, you got it
Put your hands up, put your hands up
You got it, you got it 

(I'm ready for you)
Drive back baby to me fast in your car
(Me and you boo)
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard

(I'm ready for you)
Drive back baby to me fast in your car
(For me and you boo)
I'm here waiting, crash into me real hard
Come on baby, please hurry up, you know I'm waiting for you

"event","some of you may believe in god but may think about changing your mind after these questions some of you may not and these may be reasons not to...
The bible says god created us well how did he create us when there was already ppl on Earth like Mary Joseph and the other ppl so think about that.

How did Earth become a planet how did it form how does it circle around the sun?

How did all these things happen I cant beileve that one person controls everything in the world.

I am cathlic but still if you think back on all of this you will see me point."

Have You Ever? 

Have you ever loved somebody so much
It makes you cry
Have you ever needed something so bad
You can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever

Have you ever been in love
Been in love so bad
You'd do anything to make them understand
Have you ever had someone steal your heart away
You'd give anything to make them feel the same
Have you ever searched for words to get you in their heart
But you don't know what to say
And you don't know where to start

Have you ever loved somebody so much
It makes you cry
Have you ever needed something so bad
You can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever

Have you ever found the one
You've dreamed of all your life
You don't do anything to look into their eyes
Have you finally found the one you've givin your heart to
Only to find that one won't give their heart to you
Have you ever closed your eyes and
Dreamed that they were there
And all you can do is wait for that day when they will care

What do I gotta do to get you in my arms baby
What do I gotta do to get to your heart
To make you understand how I need you next to me
Gotta get you in my world
'Coz baby I can't sleep

Hilary Duff 
Someone's Watching Over Me 

Found myself today
Oh I found myself and ran away
Something pulled me back
The voice of reason I forgot I had
All I know is just you're not here to say
What you always used to say
But it's written in the sky tonight

So I won't give up
No I won't break down
Sooner than it seems life turns around
And I will be strong 
Even if it all goes wrong
When I'm standing in the dark I'll still believe
Someone's watching over me

Seen that ray of light
And it's shining on my destiny
Shining all the time
And I wont be afraid
To follow everywhere it's taking me
All I know is yesterday is gone
And right now I belong
Took this moment to my dreams

So I won't give up
No I won't break down
Sooner than it seems life turns around
And I will be strong 
Even if it all goes wrong
When I'm standing in the dark I'll still believe
Someone's watching over me

It doesn't matter what people say
And it doesn't matter how long it takes
Believe in yourself and you'll fly high
And it only matters how true you are
Be true to yourself and follow your heart

So I won't give up
No I won't break down
Sooner than it seems life turns around
And I will be strong 
Even if it all goes wrong
When I'm standing in the dark I'll still believe
That I won't give up
No I won't break down
Sooner than it seems life turns around
And I will be strong 
Even when it all goes wrong
When I'm standing in the dark I'll still believe 
That someone's watching over
Someone's watching over
Someone's watching over me

Someone's watching over me

 Kelly Clarkson 
Gone 

What you see's not what you get
With you there's just no measurement
No way to tell what's real from what isn't there
Your eyes they sparkle
That's all changed into lies that drop like acid rain
You washed away the best of me
You don't care

You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for
In this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You're wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

Sometimes shattered
Never open
Nothing matters
When you're broken
That was me whenever I was with you
Always ending
Always over
Back and forth, up and down like a rollercoaster
I am breaking
That habit
Today

You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for
In this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You're wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

There is nothing you can say
Sorry doesn't cut it, babe
Take the hint and walk away
'Cause I'm gone
Doesn't matter what you do
It's what you did that's hurting you
All I needed was the truth
Now I'm gone

What you see's not what you get
What you see's not what you get

You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for
In this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You're wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone
I'm already gone
Oh, I'm already gone, gone, gone, gone
Already gone
I'm gone

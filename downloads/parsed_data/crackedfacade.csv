I'm tired, and not to drone on in complaint about my life, but I have way too much work to do between now and the end of the semester, something about fulltime work, class, and 13 papers just doesn't suit me well.  plus i think mono, or some sister byproduct is back, I have the hardest time functioning lately.

I'm depressed.  Guess thats not really unusual anymore.  Trying to make plans for the future.  Its times like these that I feel like a mouse in a maze.  Running along these tunnels only to find my way blocked, usually by the issue of money.

"event","So, I was informed Fri. morning that I had a roommate moving in sometime this week, and that I had check out everyone from their apts. since jess (RA, roommate) would be out of town.  none of this i really minded, besides the short notice.  So I called new roomie, and left a message welcoming her and telling her to give me a call so I knew when she was coming and could make sure there was room for her.  I also told them I had to check them out.  Now, did she call back? no.  I walk into the apt. last night, already in a bad mood, to find a bunch of random stuff around....I walk into my bedroom to find MY stuff all out of sorts.  and this dainty, prissy thing on the second bureau.  I think to myself, why didn't she call? but realize i'm somewhat hard to get ahold of, despite my ANSWERING MACHINE! so, perhaps she left me a note.  No note, no indication she was there besides all her stuff.  Then she comes walking in, talks to me flippantly for a few moments, gets bedding, and goes to spend the night somewhere else.  She quickly brought in a chair then left, said she'd be back tomorrow (today) for good.  Now, I'm sorry, i know she's moving in to here, but its still been MY apt. all summer, she could at least have the courtesy to leave a note that she had moved in, or show some sign of interest in me as a person.  She was cold and uncaring despite my try at conversation.  I know i'm no conversationalist, but at least I try!  To add to it, as soon as she walked in, I recognized her, as a friend of my roommate from last year, the older student who really wants nothing to do with people and was going to get a single room to avoid interaction.  She will be rooming with one of the most assertive females on campus, another one who has a history of not getting along with roommates. so, it seems Jess and I will be closing our door a lot this semester!  ugh, I'm getting to old for this roommate thing :)"

"event","I need new friends (note: If you're reading this, I'm not referring to you)  I'm referring to the purposeless people who do nothing but complain about their problems without trying to fix them.  I'm referring to those who desire nothing more than companionship (or at least express no more desire than that)  I'm an intense person.  I know this.  I spent many years trying to stifle it which just made me bottle things up and completely fake.  Now, I find myself in a similar situation.  I want more than companions.  I desire a relationship where I want to give as much to them as they to me.  I want friends who desire accountability.  I hate this frail fakeness that does nothing but tie us to our old selves.  I'm far from the person I was, and far from the person I hope to become,  and I want someone who desires to go somewhere as well...*sigh* at least I have Ryan.  We talked about that at length last night, as well as studying biblical prophecy.  I got embarrassed because as we were talking tears flooded by eyes...I was awestruck by this one statement saying the prophey was representing God's voice, and the vividness of their description of that powerful voice brought me to tears, the thought of the misrepresentation of His voice, and the desire to see the kids I have come to love at TNT grow, brought me to these quiet steady tears that I fail to get even when I scream for it in personal agony.  But they come so easily for others.  and as I cried for all that I was embarrassed for a moment...til Ryan smiled and took my hand and pointed out how much it showed I love God...and I pondered this for awhile...because the truth is, I often doubt my love for God.  Never His for me....never my salvation.. (well, not NEVER, but very rarely), but my love for Him, because I could, and should, do so much more.  He deserves so much more from me...but I do love him, and I will continue to love Him more...and a lot of times I have selfish motives, and i'm prideful and I fail to consider eternal value of my actions far too often...and i could continue to list my sinful attitudes and actions...but I do love God, and I am growing and trying, and God is working in my life.  That made me smile.  Every day at work I go through the obituaries, to see if a donor died.  I'm struck by different things I find.  4 yr old starved to death by his parents, by what people choose to put as their eye catching line,usually a profession, although when they die young, its more about their relationships.  a suicide victim....a constrant reminder of where i was a year ago.  what will people remember of me?  That I liked to read and write, or that people were generally intimidated by me because i have few social skills...or will i be remembered for my passion to see others change, develop...  I need to live the way I want to be seen, or i have no right to be seen that way...Theres an obituary for a child most every day.
Dr. Wilson said he could see the pain in my eyes, my sides do hurt more than usual today...i had hoped no one would notice. na ja. back to work"

"event","the retreat I was on this weekend was most definitely...interesting. I had almost forgotten that unavoidable musty smell, and almost edible food, the cornerstones to camplife.  Random award went to one of my kids, Erin, who woke up the entire cabin (and the one next to ours) with a blood-curdling scream.  Why? she's not sure, she may have had a bad dream.  We had a band come fri. night to play, and the group pleased everyone when it played their version of Sweet Home Alabama, I've never seen the hicks and punks of our group mingle, but to that they did!  There were many games in the gym throughout the weekend, a high ropes course (which Ryan threatened to do without belays, silly boy)  and for those of us who were less athletic (or like me, sick AND unathletic) we had swimming, and a lot of talk time.  I got to know one girl really well whom I had never even met before, and it was great to see ryan and I really start to become part of the group. We even had a guy accept Christ Sat. night, Praise the Lord!  and the girl I've been counseling for several months now, the whole weekend cemented lessons she has learned, and we had a wonderful breakthrough while on the swings at midnight.

those were the good things...now for the less good.  The lessons were about realizing Christ does not demand us to be perfect christians before we come to him, we can come with all our baggage and give it to him. Great right? well, kinda, but not when the leader makes statements like ""I don't know why there is pain in this world"" and not when a blanket statement is made like, ""All you need to do is give it to God and its completely gone.""  anyone who really believes that must not have ever dealt with any kind of addiction.  We sang this song that went on and on about how it was time, we can ""hear the calling in the rain""  it was supposedly a prophetic song, written 3 years ago by people we've never met. they were worried the song will lose meaning.  I was worried we would never get to a song that actually mentioned anything about God, the one we're supposedly worshipping.  Sat. night is basically the basis for my negative attitude towards the weekend.  The kids could choose to write down what they need to give to God, and stick it on this big cross.  they were then brought to the center, and about 2 hours was spent praying separately for each individual.  That, is great, amazing, what an opportunity to realize God's power, and also a great form of fellowship.  But then it turned to prophecy.  here I had a problem.  I had a problem when someone tried to call a demon out of a christian girl who just wanted confidence to share Christ with her friends.  I had a problem when the ""Prophet"" told one girl to ignore him if he was wrong since he didn't know her too well... hold up now.  If you're a prophet, what you're saying is from God, and it better be true, if its not, well, in the Bible false prophets were killed.  I was frustrated with the emphasis placed on this high emotional response with little substance.  No help was given for the times  a month later when it feels like God's no longer helping.  Emotional responses to God are wonderful, but if its only that, I fail to see how that relationship is little more than a selfish one aimed towards self emotional highs.  For your relationship to grow, you need to learn about who God is as well, i mean really, can you go around with your best friend laughing hysterically but never learning about what their character is, what they like to do, and really remain CLOSE friends?  I think not.
On a positive note,  Ryan agreed with me, so I wasn't alone, and God gave me intuition is amazing ways to reach kids, hopefully in a more permanent way.  I hope to hold several of them accountable and continue to work with them, make sure that the emotion becomes concrete in their lives.
I'm sorry, that was probably really sporadic and hard to understand, I have a tendency to lose the ability to express myself clearly when i'm really fired up, and my passion burns on this subject.  I don't think charismatic issues are clear enough in scripture to condemn one side as heretics, but i do think you better be biblical about whatever side you choose.  and they certainly were not.

I think we're going to talk to our supervisor about it, i think we need to.  I just keep praying for those kids, and that I won't get mad at the people in a sinful way.

on a better note, Ryan and I had a great time yesterday, watched a movie, took a walk, slept (to make up for the weekend), made dinner together, started a puzzle, and talked...a lot.  :)  I get to seem today too, in 2 more hours."

I shall summarize my appt. yesterday thus:
""We don't know how to help you, sorry, and by the way, you have a heightened risk for cancer and probably will have a hard time if its even possible to have children.""

ouch... but hey, i have another appt. in two weeks with a different specialist, and until then i've decided to do everything in my power to be the model healthy person, drink 8 c. water a day, eat, exercise...i'll even take the meds that don't work.... 

as to the children thing...i'm crushed...not that i'm the typical LBC girl wanting 10 kids....but I am a girl...but ya know, they can't know that thing when I haven't even tried, and there are so many medical miracles nowadays, and I've always wanted to adopt...it'll be alright.

So once again, God had held me in His arms and given me breath for another day.  I'm excited for this weekend, i almost feel rejuvented, in an exhausted sort of way :)"

I'm tired of this ride.  I'm sick of getting up day after day only to be greeted by pain.  My facade is growing stale and everyone is going to see me for the miserable wimpy failure I am.  I need to escape with God today.  Here's hoping my roomies are out tonight.  I know he promises the energy for each moment, if not the stored energy for the next, but I'm tired.

I actually got to spend more time with her than expected, we got to catch up and before we knew it it was like old times.  She showed me the house they are complete renivating and I got to be with the bridal party and help out in all sorts of ways.  My father and I got along the entire time!  The only bad part was coming home.  Sure, i missed Ryan terribly, and was glad to be back home to be with him, but otherwise....let's face it,i just don't fit in.  My roomate mocks my intellectual ""cuteness"" and i seriously have to spend an hour just praying to keep my other roomie from dragging me back down into depression.  To just be myself, completely, and be accepted... I know much of it is my fault.  I hem myself into a facade.  I put on the fake grin.  I know whats expected of me and I do it....but lately, I'm no longer content with that....but i also have not arrived at the place where i can be comfortable in my natural skin.  So I wobble and people think I'm upset, and don't unerstand and I can't prove otherwise.  *sigh* with time, a work in progress, life's liminality is constant, I guess i'm just feeling it more lately.  

I've been narrowing down graduate school choices, its pretty much down to 6 + a given acceptance.


OOOOO Ryan sent me flowers at work today.  I got beat red and my cheesy grin that I STILL get whenever I hear his name (see, i have it now jsut thinking about him)  It was a really encouraging gesture in light of the lack of time we've had to spend together, his going to Florida for a week tomorrow, and me being sick... i wasjust delighted

It means a lot to me, and its not like I'm trying to make it into a bad thing in any way.,...its just...you get used to people being certain ways. and when they break that mold....its like...you're left asking yourself what on earth to do with that person.  but i'm excited.  I've almost said I love you a few times, which is a big step for me, i'm excited.  Work has been going well....stuff..yeah....ok, i think i'm done. i'm still sick, just hoping the pain holds out for the wedding."

"event","I'm feeling so much better today!  Tuesday night Ryan did the cutest thing!  He called me up right when he got off work, and came over, and danced with me in the rain!  True, we weren't together for very long, but for those few moments, it was just freckles and I, and the droplets hedging around us. *sigh*  and I watched the end of the season finale of Ed, which ALWAYS cheers me up.  I'm slowly seeing my work get completed despite my procrastination.  Then yesterday, Tracy was so nice, she totally went through my resume with me, helped me edit it, then I took it to two offices so far, We'll see how that goes, but I was just so excited to take that step.  And I went to ryan's, not for long, but I got to see some of the animatrix, and we had fun.  Today is Thursday, which is my favorite day of the week.  Why you ask? because tonight's my internship.  I get to catch up on the kid's lives...oooh i just enjoy being there, helping them.  secondly,,, I've always wanted to be a ""regular"" at some place.  You know, walk into a restaurant and have them know exactly what i want, know me by name.  So Ryan and I have started going to this place called Pieros, a little Italian restaurant, every Thursday evening on our way to TNT (internship)  the food is wonderful, and i hope they recognize us soon!  so yeah, things are better.  Thanks for letting me vent last time.  God is good...all the time.  Bis Dann"

"event","I know I did fun things this weekend and such, but somehow,my brain can't seem to register them.  I'm overwhelmed with the amount of work due for my class this week, and the fact that its my fault its the last week and I didn't get enough done yet.  I'm overwhelmed by all the work that needs to go into grad school applications.  I get too little sleep for as sick as i am.  I'm overwhelmed by not having any frickin answers to my pain.  I'm tired of being always sick, always tired, always drained, but having no official reason for it and so, continuing on like any other day.  I'm tired of seeing ryan inbetween our schedules and doing nothing but sleep most of the time....i can't remember the last time we had time for a good conversation.  I'm sick by being defined by the people I associate with as the girlfriend of ryan.  I miss having my own friends at home.  I'm homesick for a cheesesteak and a walk in Rittenhouse square, a midnight stromboli at Rich and Tammy's. I know, i know, I KNOW, that I chose this, that everything will work out as fitting to God, that he will get me through it....i'm just so tired right now.  And i've been trying really hard to keep up with people's lives, let them know that i'm praying for them so that they might have encouragement in it....I love doing that, for others and myself, prayer molds us so i learn more and more.  but..i guess i just have this nagging thought, is anyone praying for me? because i need it....sorry for the depressing entry....tschus"

"event","So I dyed my hair.  Its almost an auburn color.  I think I may actually like it but it'll be out in 6-12 washes so it doesn't much matter.  Last night was my internship.  I spent two hours in intense counseling with a suicidal girl.  It was rough, but by the end....it was amazing to watch God's truth melt away some of the pain.  I don't think I really understood until I got into counseling just how big the difference was between knowing the truth and believing it. I know a lot, i've had class after class to tell me about the Bible, but how much do i really deep down believe as evidenced by application?  more than i did, but not enough.  Never enough.  Which is a good thing, it gives me a direction for growth.

Summer Projects:

work
two summer classes

Study for LSATs

"event","I am so sore right now!  my sides have been screaming all day, which gives persistent thought to those awaited test results looming over my head, and on top of it, my back has really bad rug burn from jessica(aka roommate) pulling me across the floor.  It was hilarious at the time, but now, OUCH!!!!  

On a brighter note, today was my last day of my first summer class.  I enjoyed the class, I really think I learned from it!  So now I have to do all the work, but thats not due until the ninth so I have time.  They have upgraded my responsibilites at work, so its not quite as boring anymore.  ooo I got my grades today, 3 A- (one which i'm still fighting) and 3 A's for a 3.85 woohoo!  considering how sick i've been, i was shocked, and very excited!

I saw several movies over the last week.  X2, which was indeed better than the first one.  I also saw Identity, which I highly recommend,  especially if you like movies like Memento.  As for Matrix Reloaded....  first let me say, that whole orgy/sex scene was completely unnecessary.  What they aimed to get across to the audience could have been done in many other ways.  Secondly, it is not another Godfather II.  In that i mean, what made that movie so amazing besides all its other amazing attributes, was, despite it being in the middle of a trilogy, it could, can, stand alone.  Reloaded cannot do that at all.  In fact, besides its spectacular special affects (which no one can deny) and the car chase scene, i really don't feel it can be properly critiqued without its completion in november.  Of course I've pondered it, and have all sorts of thoughts on the matter, but without knowing the final outcome, we really can know very little.  One thought I have had, is that the architect is just another program, if they can't beat him with brute force, try tricking him.  Also, what on earth is mr. smith now?!  my thought is, if you want to take the biblical route, he left ""God"" and thinks he can rule above the Matrix as well, and he's evil...Satan?  But i'm not too big a fan of biblical paradigms so I will end that there.  ok, enough for today... vale (be well)"

"event","I've never had a fight with a roommate.  Perhaps a minor disagreement over where to get the pizza, but otherwise, nothing.  I'm pretty laid back i think, just everyone respect each other.  
I just about blew up last night.  They went out for hours with the door unlocked, and my roomie, who is also the RA, changed the meeting time without telling me and without making sure everyone was aware of the time switch.  so i come home just in time for the meeting to find people waiting quite unsure of themselves because the RA wasn't there.  Worst thing is, when i finally got ahold of her, she didn't seem to care.  So i did the meeting and apologized profusely for her.  I then stayed up late because i didn't want to go to bed with the door unlocked but they didn't have their keys on them.  *sigh* I'm just depressed by the whole atmosphere of the apt.  I know i'm vulnerable and need to watch my environment.  This one is not conducive to me being happy.  I guess its lesson time from God.  No matter my external conditions, God can continue to work in and through me. What an amazing thought!
We've been talking about calvinism in God and the Bible.  I don't know what I believe yet.  This thought kept coming to my mind throughout it though.  Why on earth would God elect me over anyone else.  ME! prideful, self-conscious, too analytical for her own good me!  Perhaps I'll have to wait for eternity to understand that, no matter what it is, i know i'm thankful.  i wish i could be funny in here, but alas, i'm only funny when i try not to be. so i won't. cause it'll just sound dumb.  I want to discuss matrix. but that will ahve to be at a later date, i actually have work to do now. vale."

"event","so i wrote this in response to a book i had to read for english about a socialworker who kills under priviledged children in the name of charity, it may not work at all b/c its so abstract, so i may end up writing another, we'll see:

time has come for the ball to drop
the mask withdrawn from the masquerade
let the bold faced lies come forth

compliments lay strewn amongst the ashes of the hearth
as tattered photographs taste the current of the wave
and motivational integrity heaves its last belabored breath


wizened meets puerile like an specious puzzle
each piece interlocked with ceaseless gaping holes
charade of broken trusts under the weight of time


wisps of curls fragrance your fingers, lips,
they shine of strawberry gloss as you bathe
your blackened soul in the sweet perfume of your juvenilia.


the headlines read of x-rated material
and Dorian's stare meets my gaze."

"event","oh me oh my, so Thursday, I had quite the adventure in finding my way to LBC. I shall paraphrase so as not to bore you all to death. After several missed buses (the schedule was waaay off) I finally made the 2:05 sometime before 2. The ride felt like an outtake from Speed. That feeling of going over a huge pothole in a small car...yeah, we had that for some solid time. I never saw people fly off a bus so quickly. So, i'm a block away from my transfer bus with 2 min. to spare. I rush and can see it on the other side, but i'm stuck by a redlight. As I step into the stree to proceed, it drives away. I chased after it but no use. I check, the next bus doesn't come til 3:35. Furious, frustrated, and tired, I decide to walk the 15 min. drive. It doesn't take me long to remember I'm sick and shouldn't be doing this. All of the sudden i see this guy. He seriously looked like one of those superheros where his legs and waist are all skinny but his upperbody is twice the size it should be. He called to me but I just ignored and walked by, I grew up by philly, I know not to talk to strangers. So, I'm rushing on. I soon realize too things, i'm not exactly sure where I am, and I'm being followed by mammoth man. I hid in a CVS, and found my way back to the bus stop (I also found a quaint used bookstore that I loved) This is when I realize I can't take the 3:35 bus because a) my transfer will have expired and b)I won't be to LBC before 4 which is necessary to get all my papers handed in) so i find a bus that leaves at 3:20 and lets me off about 2 mi. away. I hightailed it from the stop to school and made it with 5-10 min. to spare. so that was my tale for thursday.
In other news, my illness has been classified recovering mono, with a cold on top, and yesterday I developed pink eye. PLEASE would whoever took my immune system please return it?! You can just slip it under the door at night, I will not prosecute, I just want it back. On a more serious note: I've been sick 4 of the 6 months ryan and I have been together. FOUR. I feel bad, he deserves so much more than what I give him. Maybe I'll get up the strength for an extra dose of energy and have a lightsaber battle or something, he would like that....we're going bowling tonight, need to conserve energy for that. ok, i shall go try to do something productive right now in time to take a good nap."

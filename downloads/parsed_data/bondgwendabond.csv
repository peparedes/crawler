"event","Well, actually she's not all that great at the literal ass-kicking, though willing to give it an old college try in a pinch. Anyway, <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/jonowrimo/98676.html"">one of my JoNo compatriots</a> posted <a href=""http://www.ugo.com/channels/comics/heromachine2/heroMachine2.asp"">a link to a hero image generator</a>, and I spent awhile yesterday creating one of my book's Alexa. I can't figure out how to actually save the image in a way I&nbsp;can just quickly paste it in here in its full glory, but I&nbsp;did print a copy and scan it and <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/gwenda/2872030709/"">the result</a> will appear below. (Complete with lines in the background from the crappy printer!)<br /><br />The main thing you can't see as well in the scan is the dark olive tone of her skin. ANYWAY, it's not as if we go around in our novels talking about what our characters look like all the time (at least, I&nbsp;don't), but I have a pretty good image of them all as I'm working. And it actually felt useful (not to mention fun) to have to figure out her warddrobe and al the other million details. And now she's watching me... <br /><br />So, without further ado, Alexa Johnson, aka Medea's daughter, aka the heroine of Saving the Witch.<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3167/2872030709_52f4fb11ea.jpg?v=0"" /><br /><br />"

Anyway, the third semester is when you do your critical thesis and I'm putting together the reading list for the bibliography of mine, attempting to get a headstart on things. What I'd love from you smarty smart peeps, are your recommendations of any and all (good, bad, indifferent) young adult fantasies with strong political overtones.<br /><br />Nothing's too obvious to mention, because I'm interested in being as comprehensive as possible and my ability to overlook stuff should never be discounted. And although I'm more focused on relatively current work (last 10-15 years), classics are fine too as I haven't fully established the scope yet."

"event","Barometric pressure feels like witchcraft. We had huge freaky storms last night, and it looks like we're now having them again. We woke up to news reports about people being rescued from cars and drunk college students being swept away into storm tunnels. Water was over the pilot light, but it's all fixed now and we're unscathed. <br /><br />My JoNoWriMo week was lametastic, since I was too busy to breathe. We even canceled a trip to N.C. this weekend, because life and work just didn't permit. But I managed to get back on track today, at least in terms of new words. This section of the book involves a huge scene at a White House state dinner and it is hard, hard, hard to manage so far. But I did get to write about <a href=""http://www.jssgallery.org/Paintings/President_Theodore_Roosevelt.htm"">Sargent's Teddy Roosevelt</a> today. <br />

So yay diex! We did my FAFSA crap for loans (financial aid just doesn't exist anymore, does it?).<br /><br />I'm feeling better and we're off to visit my parents for the night.

"event","Forgot to mention that I received a nice rejection from Gordon for the Slush Bomb Story a couple of days ago; liked the characters and thinks they will play very well in the YA market. In other words, <a href=""http://bondgwendabond.livejournal.com/3060.html"">exactly as I predicted</a>! (Although not the nice thing about the characters, which is good because they're going to be my next book, plus one.)<br /><br />So I suppose it goes off to Cicada next. But I actually think it's also very much a fantasy story and could go to a genre market with a different sort of taste than F&amp;SF, so Strange Horizons and Fantasy are three and four on the list of Places To Submit."

"event","Apologies for the garbled syntax -- kind of a garbled week. It's been a nonproductive one in terms of words anyway, but I've actually been crazy motivated and just too busy to sit down and do it. FINALLY got some time and banged out a bit, and I absolutely cannot wait to write the next few chapters. I love this part of newbookland.<br /><br />It's funny. I have this sort of outline that's not really an outline. It's basically a long file of story and character notes and (public domain) poetry and such that I want to maybe use at the start of different sections. And it's always amazing to me how effortlessly something that seemed like a good idea for a little bit of plot when I was typing up the notes becomes a completely different, much more interesting thing without my even noticing until I happen to be looking up something and come across the original intent. There are magical objects referenced in the notes that are completely DIFFERENT magical objects now. Better magical objects. This gives me great and mighty joy. <br /><br />Yeah, I'm a nerd. <br /><br />And as the green book says, the only way to really know your story is to tell it.<br /><br />Here's the progress meter. I dream of the day it hits 50 percent.<br />

"event","There are things about this book which scare me nigh unto death every time I let myself think about them (how political it is at heart, how big the landscape it occupies is, how much I love it): I think that's a good sign. I'm coming up on some huge set-piece events that should be truly fun to write, and I will not consider how hard they'll be to pull off until afterward. Yeah, right. If this approach has ever worked for anyone, let me know.<br /><br />I'm hoping to write more later, but I'm also committed to represent my class (1993) at this year's Gov's School for the Arts graduation later in the afternoon, conveniently taking place a block from where we live. It's the 20th anniversary of the program. So I figured I'd do my little progress meter now; about 1200 new words since the last time. <br /><br />Also, as my main birthday present, I'm getting a new Mac at the end of the month (when freelance $$ and time to drive up to the Apple Store in Cincy arrive), and I've been thinking about where I want my habitual writing space to be for this book, once I'm not tied to the desk. Sort of inspired (oh, hateful word) by <a href=""http://glenhirshberg.com/blog/?p=58"">Glen Hirshberg's writing space posts</a>; I especially like the part about having different light. I spend so much time messing around online, or doing other types of work at desks, that the idea of having a spacial trigger for writing time hugely appeals. My office in our old place had the comfy chair in the corner and two French doors that closed it off and that was my symbol I was working, to close those doors. Nothing so handy here, but I'm thinking. Anyway, I want to come up with somewhere I like because my desk desperately needs to be replaced. And my chair stinks. But the dog has sort of claimed my corner, tin-ceiling room chair where I originally thought I'd set up shop in this house. Maybe Emma will just have to get displaced. (More likely, I will just have lots of dog hair on my back after I write.) We'll see. I'm torn about it, because I want a regular space but I also pride myself on being able to write anywhere. But, sadly, being able doesn't actually mean you are writing in all these exotic locales, like the library, the coffee shop, etc. Having a regular space means You Are Writing when you sit there. Of course, Christopher's been wanting to do writing at the coffeeshop, so I guess we could do that some too, in the evenings, post-Emma walk. But only if he can write in the evening. Fascinating as this is, I will stop now and have lunch and put on a dress and then we do the graduation and then my parents for (possibly) red velvet pre-birthday birthday cake.<br />

"event","So, all the freelance work at the moment is freelanced (one bit fell through, and I'm actually glad&nbsp; -- short, funny story), the grad school application is applicationed and sent (crossing of fingers! I had a dream last night in which MFA residencies are like spy school; a girl can dream), and the writing has begun again. And, well, I'm also <a href=""http://gwendabond.typepad.com/bondgirl/2006/06/items_of_decorp.html"">about half a month earlier than I thought on all this</a> (mostly given to the fallen through, and proving that one can attempt to drive oneself batcruise crazy), which is all to the good.<br /><br />At some point, I really will swear off parentheticals over here. <br /><br />This morning I sat down and wrote some honest to god new words. Some of them having a little fun at West Virginia's expense even. <br /><br />And Christopher finished a big proposal this weekend, so we took the afternoon bye-bye to see Superman Returns (LOVED!!! Esp. Parker Posey) and then had a way too expensive early dinner. It is one hundred degrees here. And we still need to walk Miss Emma the Dog-Girl.

"event","I'm working on my Vermont College MFA program application (which I already feel stupid for talking about, because, you know, I could not make it in and then you would know and think evil, evil thoughts about it) (I'm kidding, about the evil thoughts anyway) this week, since <a href=""http://www.kellylink.net"">Kelly</a> mailed off her recommendation letter already and <a href=""http://www.scottwesterfeld.com"">Scott</a>'s will go out any day now. And so I've filled out the application and transcript-requested and drafted an application essay (oh, woe, I hate you) and a thrown together a ""critical essay"" (about <span class=""ljuser""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" alt="""" src=""/stc/fck/editor/plugins/livejournal/userinfo.gif"" style=""vertical-align: bottom;"" />ribinder</span>'s Boy Proof, based off the blog entry I did about it way back when -- I may have to formal this up a little yet). AND I've been editing the 25-page writing sample (Times New Roman, bless you for breaking this at the right place when Courier was being mean), which is actually why I'm posting here. <br /><br />I know this doesn't really count, but it does, oh, it does today. I added a couple hundred words to Aztec Dance Tunes in the polishingness, so updated progress bar(!). (And really, once this stuff goes out, I can start working on ADT again; I finished a massive amount of freelance stuff over the weekend.) Without further justification:<br />

<br />Man, that's a long haul by the endish of September. But doable. And hey, I hear the equinox (22nd) is <span class=""ljuser""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" style=""vertical-align: bottom;"" src=""/stc/fck/editor/plugins/livejournal/userinfo.gif"" alt="""" />snurri</span>'s birthday, which is <em>clearly</em> a sign that I will make the deadline.<br /><br />p.s. I wonder what it means that I decided to do this -- and to finish on the equinox -- on Solstice, without even realizing it. Insert metaphysical wiggling of fingers here."

"event","I've decided to start keeping a little Aztec Dance Tunes progress diary over here too. (Those who have friended, do not fear -- it'll only be updated a couple of times a week.) What I really, really, really want is one of those little progress bars, you know, so many words out of the estimated total, and then I'll come up with some fun metrics. Because I don't think most of <a href=""http://gwendabond.typepad.com"">S&amp;S</a>'s readers want to see this stuff, yet I feel compelled to keep up with it to shame myself into getting a draft done by September 22. <br /><br />But I am clueless about how to find the code to do the progress bar.

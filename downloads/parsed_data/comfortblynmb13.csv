"event","Boys are so dumb! I just don't understand...... why can't they think for themselves, honestly it wouldn't hurt. Why does everyone always have to care what other people. I certainly don't unless its somthing that effects my friends or family.... or sexual prefferance(haha). I quote.... ""I don't care what people say about me, if they are talking shit atleast they are talking about me, instead of me being ignored."" Thank you Rachel! You truly have inspired me. Back to what I was saying Think for yourself honestly because if you don't you'll just end up like everyone else.

"event","This weekend is our first competition and I am certainly excited, and everything is going really well and everything..... I had a pretty great weekend and I'm really glad Kourtoc and I got closer, because we weren't doing to well before, and she got alittle closer to Gucci, haha silly putty HAHA! And I watched 8 1/2 hours of Queer eye for the straight guy, and learned so much! Jushing is quite possibly the best word ever! And I just want everyone to know that if you heard anything about me being a Lesbian, Its not true. I don't understand why people can't take jokes, but what hurts me the most is that none of the people I thought were my ""friends"" said anything to me about it, they just axcepted it as if it was like what they thought  all along. I just don't understand? That kinda hurts that no one told me.Second thing I would like to issue is how glad I am that I might be going to AAC in chicago next year. Haha it kinda coinsides with the first issue. I not completely sure anyone will miss me much. I really hope so because I will miss alot of people but I just dont know if it will change anyones life, i mean no one has to die because i'm going away but I hope someone misses me as thier friend. Just at this moment I'm not quite sure I have to many TRUE friends, more just people who talk to me. Well I'll miss alot of you If i go. Im sorry. I'm going to go now.

Also I would like to retract that last statement about the ""liar"", all is better on the e/s front.I'm just glad people have enough balls to apologize for things. So I've been at Lucas Sabdra's house all week and this has seriously been alot of fun, they are crazy! I have not stopped laughing at this crazy pumkin pie hair cutted freak all week. But on a more serious note K-dogg I hope all is well for you and the Reunion is on. I pray for the best for you.

"event","I went to the doctor today for my third time regarding the problem with my ear. I had a chance before for insurance, but I wasn't getting enough hours to even pay my entire share of the rent, so my brother's more or less made me get another job. Well, yeah. Needless to say, I don't have insurance now. I told the doctor today that my ear's been bothering me the last four or five days. Even got dizzy for a couple hours the day before yesterday. The doctor said he simply cannot and will not do the surgery without insurance, because it's a potentially serious procedure. One that could risk in permanent hearing loss, or facial paralysis. So to keep himself safe from the ever present threat of being sued, etc, I'll have to get insurance first, period.

Anyway. Amber asked the other night what exactly it was, so I dug this up. Have a look, if you really want. ::shrug::


""What Is a Cholesteatoma? 

A cholesteatoma is a skin growth that occurs in an abnormal location, the middle ear behind the eardrum. It is usually due to repeated infection, which causes an ingrowth of the skin of the eardrum. Cholesteatomas often take the form of a cyst or pouch that sheds layers of old skin that builds up inside the ear. Over time, the cholesteatoma can increase in size and destroy the surrounding delicate bones of the middle ear. Hearing loss, dizziness, and facial muscle paralysis are rare but can result from continued cholesteatoma growth.

How Does It Occur?

A cholesteatoma usually occurs because of poor eustachian tube function as well as infection in the middle ear. The eustachian tube conveys air from the back of the nose into the middle ear to equalize ear pressure (""clear the ears""). When the eustachian tubes work poorly perhaps due to allergy, a cold or sinusitis, the air in the middle ear is absorbed by the body, and a partial vacuum results in the ear. The vacuum pressure sucks in a pouch or sac by stretching the eardrum, especially areas weakened by previous infections. This sac often becomes a cholesteatoma. A rare congenital form of cholesteatoma (one present at birth) can occur in the middle ear and elsewhere, such as in the nearby skull bones. However, the type of cholesteatoma associated with ear infections is most common.

What Are the Symptoms?

Initially, the ear may drain, sometimes with a foul odor. As the cholesteatoma pouch or sac enlarges, it can cause a full feeling or pressure in the ear, along with hearing loss. (An ache behind or in the ear, especially at night, may cause significant discomfort.) Dizziness, or muscle weakness on one side of the face (the side of the infected ear) can also occur. Any, or all, of these symptoms are good reasons to seek medical evaluation.

Is It Dangerous?

Ear cholesteatomas can be dangerous and should never be ignored. Bone erosion can cause the infection to spread into the surrounding areas, including the inner ear and brain. If untreated, deafness, brain abscess, meningitis, and rarely death can occur.

What Treatment Can be Provided?

An examination by an otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon can confirm the presence of a cholesteatoma. Initial treatment may consist of a careful cleaning of the ear, antibiotics, and ear drops. Therapy aims to stop drainage in the ear by controlling the infection. The extent or growth characteristics of a cholesteatoma must also be evaluated.

Large or complicated cholesteatomas usually require surgical treatment to protect the patient from serious complications. Hearing and balance tests, x-rays of the mastoid (the skull bone next to the ear), and CAT scans (3-D x-rays) of the mastoid may be necessary. These tests are performed to determine the hearing level remaining in the ear and the extent of destruction the cholesteatoma has caused.

Surgery is performed under general anesthesia in most cases. The primary purpose of the surgery is to remove the cholesteatoma and infection and achieve an infection-free, dry ear. Hearing preservation or restoration is the second goal of surgery. In cases of severe ear destruction, reconstruction may not be possible. Facial nerve repair or procedures to control dizziness are rarely required. Reconstruction of the middle ear is not always possible in one operation; and therefore, a second operation may be performed six to twelve months later. The second operation will attempt to restore hearing and, at the same time, inspect the middle ear space and mastoid for residual cholesteatoma. 

Admission to the hospital is usually done the morning of surgery, and if the surgery is performed early in the morning, discharge maybe the same day. For some patients, an overnight stay is necessary. In rare cases of serious infection, prolonged hospitalization for antibiotic treatment may be necessary. Time off from work is typically one to two weeks.

Follow-up office visits after surgical treatment are necessary and important, because cholesteatoma sometimes recurs. In cases where an open mastoidectomy cavity has been created, office visits every few months are needed in order to clean out the mastoid cavity and prevent new infections. In some patients, there must be lifelong periodic ear examinations.

Summary

Cholesteatoma is a serious but treatable ear condition which can only be diagnosed by medical examination. Persisting earache, ear drainage, ear pressure, hearing loss, dizziness, or facial muscle weakness signals the need for evaluation by an otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon.""


So there's no reason why I should be anything than less than angry and worried. Goddamn it."

"event","So....

Lowe's calls yesterday and tells me that orientation is today at 9:30 AM. Okay. Well, my car crapped out, so I'm forced to asking my mom for a ride. So, I have to spend the night at her house to catch the ride in the morning.

No big deal.

So I get to orientation, I do it, and then we're free to go. So, I call mom. No answer... I wait a while, then call again. No answer. 

I wait another hour -- no answer. I didn't really want to walk 8 miles if I didn't have to.

Well, fuck it. I started walking. Traffic is insane at that intersection because of the massive construction project they're doing. Adding in a skyway tollway. 

Anywho, so instead of wading through reckless drivers of Austin on busy city streets, I decide to cut through the large area where there's nothing going on -- a thicket, of sorts, really.

So I'm walking and walking and walking... and I think I hear something. So I look around. See nothing. Keep walking and walking and walking.. hear something again. Sounds like a jingling sound.. like metal on metal, lightly nicking each other.. Still, see nothing.. So, I walk a little more, reach a barbed-wire fence, crawl through it, then I hear the jingling again.

Now on the other side of the fence, I look and see a big fucking dog. Some sort of mutt. Looked part pit and part rottweiler(spell?). It stares at me, I hold very freaking still. It's got that ""I'm really thirsty"" look about it.. Like it's panted away all of its saliva..

I stare at it for a long time... then brave a ""Hey, dog."" To which the dog responds with a snarling growl, showing teeth and stuff. 

Okay, so now I'm freaked. I slowly begin to back away, and the dog follows, crawling easily through the barbed-wire fence. I keep my side to it, so I can still see where I'm going, and watch it at the same time.

Finally after several hundred feet of this I turn and look at the dog, look around me to see if the highway is -anywhere- nearby. Or any fucking thing that has people. A goddamn gas station, anything. 

Nothing.. I look back at the dog, then start to walk again when the motherfucker comes dashing at me. All I had with me was a spiral notebook and a pen I took to orientation. By the time I look down to see what's on the ground around me, then back at the dog, the bastard is up on me, jumping. Holding my spiral in my left hand, I lift my arm to shield me. The fucker bites into the notebook and locks it down tight on my forearm, doing that swinging back and forth shit that they do. 

Meanwhile, I'm freaking the fuck out. I really didn't want to die today. I'm looking around all while kicking the stupid thing as hard as I can between cries of pain and, honestly, fear.

There was nothing within reach. The dog's fucking jaw just kept getting tighter, and by now blood and saliva were sticking the silk shirt to my arm. The only thing I could find was my pen. It was one of those thick clear ones. With the gel ink, or whatever. The dog's growling as it grinds into my fucking arm, twisting its lower body, trying to tear my fucking arm apart I guess, and all I can think about is how shitty it's going to be to die like this. With as much strength as I could muster(which at this point wasn't very much) I stabbed at the fucking dog. I must've stabbed the son of a bitch ten times before it even loosened its grip.

It dove off, yelped then snarled again I think, then lept again at me. It's claws tore the front of my shirt to rippons and cut my stomach all up, and this time it latched onto my wrist. I could swear I felt it crush.. I stabbed that dog another ten or more times before it let go again, this time taking my pen with it.

The dog lie there on the ground, dead I guess. I puked about forty times for some fucking reason, then did what I could to find the highway. Thankfully I came out of the thicket to a new strip center recently built. I went into the first place that had a door with people behind it and asked for a phone. The girl behind the counter shouted ""Oh my gosh!"" and thrust the phone at me, then backed up and stared at me with wide eyes...

My mom picked me up.. took me to the hospital.

More medical bills to add onto my already $18k worth so far.

Doctor says my wrist is fine. My forearm needed ten stitches. Gave me a whole bunch of shots for rabies I guess. I fell asleep honestly. I was worn out. All I wanted to do was get home and take a shower.

Fuck."

"event","I had quite a revealing discussion with Vanessa. My eyes were opened to someone I'd never seen, and apparently that someone was me.

I really hurt some people. Not by harsh words, but rather a complete lack thereof. A complete lack of friendship, truly. 

Friends would IM me, and I'd give them nothing. ::headshake:: Nothing to grasp onto to remember me as they knew me. As I -know- I should be.

I'm such a fuckhead. A fucking asshole. Despite the fact that I hate the way my relationship is now with Vanessa -- distant at best -- I suppose I deserve no less.

Betse: You're a very kind woman. You continued to talk to me despite the way I treated you. I'm very sorry. I never realized how I was. I don't think I deserve such a friend.

Rache: I've treated you poorly far longer than any. Why? I can't really say. My head's been mixed up, even if I didn't realize it at the time. Yet you still managed to IM me when you saw me, treating me no less than you had before such treatment was sent your way. I'm sorry for being the way I was.

Amber: Our relationship wasn't really affected, since we rarely saw each other, but there again.. A lot of that absence is my fault, for which I apologize.

Marlee: We were close, but our schedules conflicted often. You have a lot of responsiblity. Nonetheless, when you saw me, you IMed me. If I treated you poorly or with neglect, I'm sorry. 

Darcy: We already spoke. For some reason our relationship wasn't affected either, but I suppose that was also because we never saw each other. Some of which I'm sure was my fault. I'm glad to be talking to you again. You've always been a good friend.

Vanessa: What can be said that I haven't already said? I was a dick. A complete jerk. Your lack of words at first really stung, but the conversation we had afterword hurt even more. Truth hurts? Shit yeah. You took me off your friend list. When you said that, if I had any doubt about being in the wrong, this blew those doubts out of the water. We were very close friends. There was a time when all we did when we were both online together was IM all night, or sit in a PR and just bullshit. For hours. I screwed that up. The fact that I now have to work to regain your friendship pains me to my very ends. How could I have been so blind all that time? Why would I do that to you? ::headshake:: No excuse is good enough for treating any of you the way that I have. What was I thinking?

I'm so very sorry to every single one of you. Please forgive my thoughtlessness."

"event","So my right ear's been bothering me for quite some time now. Several months, but since I left my job at the stupid convenience store, I haven't had insurance. Well, I finally broke down and went to the doctor yesterday. As he looked in my ear, he said ""Mm.... not good."" So immediately I was excited. Afterward, he tells me that I have a serious condition which the membrane above my eardrum has a sore on it(this is laymens, of course, since I've forgotten his exact descriptive terms), and this sore is more or less hanging down -behind- the eardrum. I can barely hear out of my right ear, and lately when I've cleaned that ear blood shows on the q-tip.

Good times. So he recommends to me an Ear/Nose/Throat specilist, to which I say ""I don't have insurance."" And he says ""Oh.. I'm sorry to hear that.""

So.. great. I guess I need to move to Canada, otherwise I'll lose the hearing in my right ear."

"event","I'm 26 years old. Sure, I'm out on my own(living with my brothers anyway). My girlfriend wants me to move it, but likely that won't happen. That's too restricting. And I'm far too private a person sometimes for that. Weird. Sometimes I'll tell everyone in the room my innermost feelings, other times I want to be completely left alone altogether for days at a time. Who knows. I could be unknowingly bi-polar or some weird shit like that. ::smirk:: Or maybe I'm just really fucking enigmatic. Heh. 

So.. My band; Friction. We've done very well for ourselves. It's a great feeling to have the club owner come up to you, hand you a few Ben Franks and say ""You're great, kid. Business is always better when you're here."" Fucking-A. But what to do? Austin is the live music capitol of the world, or so they say. But should I get back to reality? 

Like I was saying. I don't have a decent job. Now I'm employed at a grocery store working graveyard shift for crap pay. The whole time I'm there my mind is elsewhere. Music and fantasy is constantly flowing through my head. Like my life is some long fucking movie or some such bullshit. But in the movie the character has been introduced. We know all about him. His strengths(humor, light hearted, good singer(lol), nice) and weaknesses(anxiety attacks?, aversion to a serious long-lasting relationship?), but so far the plot hasn't yet been revealed. When the fuck is this shitty movie going to get to the point? I've been watching it for 26 years already.

So I think I'm putting the band on hold for a while. Putting my relationship on hold for a while. Putting my social life on hold for a while. I feel so far behind the times. Is it nice to be in a band and party nearly every night? Hell yeah it is. There isn't a single night that goes by when there's not a knock at the door. Friends always coming over. I party a lot. I socialize a lot. It's great fun.

But.. then I look ahead. The movie doesn't look promising. Now, many of you know I'm naturally a pessimist, and that may be all that it is. My natural affinity for the un-positive. But it doesn't look good. Once I'm out of my prime. Once my music sucks; once I suck, then what? I'll just be some middle-aged motherfucker living alone remembering ""how cool"" it was to be in a band. Sure. It's cool. But I don't see any agents from Virgin Records knocking my door down. At least not any time soon. I mean goddamn. I don't even have my fucking GED. 

So anyway, with that said. I'm going to take my GED soon. Sometime early next month. And after that I'm off to get my A+ certification, along with Server Maintenence and Firewall Applications ct. Doesn't sound as fun as what Vanessa does. Her work sounds like it can be rough sometimes, but hell. Who wouldn't want to run through the woods, getting your hands and knees dirty studying animals(birds)? Yeah. I'm sure it sucks sometimes too, but you get the gist. Computers aren't terribly interesting, but it's good pay now that the market for such has picked back up around these parts. It's a field that assures good advancement. And though I'll likely have to make the change from night owl to early bird, it'll be worth it the end.

I think the fantasy needs to end and I need to shake my head clear of the that fog. I've lived it for too long. The Rat Race isn't something to look forward to, but I think it'll open more opportunities.

So wow. That's one hell of a fucking long post. But I haven't posted in... what? A year almost? I miss you gals. I hope you don't think I've ignored any of you. I've just been caught up in a good movie for a while. I hope this post will re-open past relationships. If you see me, IM me. If I don't IM you first, I'll likely not at the keys.

Hope to talk to y'all soon. Adios for now."

"event","Religion, man. Why can't all religions be like the Buddhists? Fat dude finds true happiness. What's it all mean? In a nutshell, enjoy life, enjoy yourself, enjoy the company of others, and never willingly/knowingly surround yourself with negativity. Basically, Buddha(Siddhartha Gautama) said that suffering is necessary. It's impossible to avoid, yet through spiritual/moral cleansing, one can continue to find his own happiness.

He enjoyed life to its fullest, indulging in whatever made him happy. In -whatever- made him happy.

Other relgions say different. Some even say, basically, if it feels good, it's bad. These are the religions I feel are close-minded. They restrict you in your wants/desires, and your all-around happiness. They tell you to do this, or that. They tell you to -fear- your god. Why? Well, his wrath is far worse than anything you could possibly imagine. Buddha wasn't a deity, or an avatar, or anything of the sort, but his teachings have become a religion. I, personally, feel it's the most practical. You needn't shed yourself of all worldly posessions. You don't have to fear your god, or your god's enemy. 

Jesus Christ was a real man, I believe.

Siddhartha Gautama was a real man.

Buddha, however -- at least, as far as I know -- didn't claim to be the fleshy-embodiment of an overpower. The ""Creator,"" or any other such bullshit.

I feel Christianity is 20% historical fact, 40% wishful thinking, and 40% mythology. 

I've talked about this whole thing to my friends several time. I'm literally an endless vault of denial when it comes to Christianity. I simply find it to be a quite foolish thing. It's a very good story, with some very good characters. And some damn fine plot twists.

I mean, hell, think about it. Starting in Eden, with Lilith. She wished for equality, so was thrown out. Subservience came next, whose name was Eve.

Temptation.

Jealousy.

Murder.

Damnation.

Good stuff. Great eye-grabbers. A page turner for sure.

Miracles abound, the forces of evil closing in. A light from the heavens announces the birth/the coming of a savior. One man, with all the powers of Light. Darkness cannot compete.. except when the Romans get tired of having their Pantheon slammed. They used Christians as street lamps. Wrapped them in cotton, and soaked them with oil.

What made it so believeable was that these people -- these listeners -- had nothing else to grasp. Jesus was bold. Brave, and he spoke out in the open. He was a protestor, saying whatever it took to get the people behind him for a revolt. The sick, the poor, the downtrodden. It worked, but only too well.

The faith split. Factions and sects formed. Rulers came and went. Some embracing the religion, others damning. Eons later, innocent people are still being murdered over this fiction novel.

Somewhere in there, though, people stopped and realized that ""Faith"" couldn't provide them with everything. After all, money makes the world go 'round. So Church and State seperated, and soon, those not ruled with an iron fist(or fear of nuclear retribution) were weened off the teet of Blind Faith. Faced no longer with being burned to the stake, people began to have minds all their own, and more thought-useful relgions popped up.

But God is Money now. God in America is dead presidents. Fear God. Worship God. With God you can get better things.

And God rules State now, no longer Church. God has an organization, a massive sect called Politics.

We can't escape God, but we can be free to think of who we want our God(s) to be. Let's just hope those over on the other side of the world will some day realize that their god is less important than they think. Over there, life is cheap, and bullets are bought by the dozens.

That's all for this rant."

So I went to McKinney this weekend to help my oldest brother move from a two bedroom apartment to a one bedroom. We got a lot done, but left some stuff for him to do himself since he still has a week. We all sat around and shot the shit, ate Taco Bueno and drank beer while SNL played in the background. I got thoroughly sloshed, naturally.

Next day, after fighting with myself over it for two days before we even drove down, I finally decided to go see Miko. She was surprised and happy to see me. As I was her. I spent the entire day with her, and really didn't want to leave when it was time to. Guess I miss her more than I realized.

Ah well. 

I had a five day weekend on account of in raining so hard last Thursday. Didn't work then, or Friday. Naturally I was off Saturday and Sunday, and again today(Monday) It was raining too hard. So, after being off for two days from having a ball bearing slung into my right shoulder-blade(which I really hope isn't cracked) from a grinder, my check is going to prove to be near nothing. The woes of working as a sub-contractor, I suppose.

What else?

I'm on DSL currenly. It kicks much ass. I've been downloading songs and software like mad. Yes, I said -software-. It's called Morpheus. Like Napster, except you can download anything that anyone has available to be downloaded. Movies, songs, software, emulators, anything. My brother downloaded some expensive Poser add-ons and an Adobe program. It's an awesome toy, this Morpheus here. I'm a download-whore now.

"event","So today was my first day working for the Stair Company. They do gobs rail work and stairs. All sorts of intricate welded designs that follow the banisters and such. 

Anyway, today went well. I'm sore and tired, and I know I'll hardly be able to get out of bed tomorrow morning, but it was worth it. Real laid back and no stress. So today was cool.

After I ran out of stuff to do for a bit at the site(a 6 million dollar home), I dashed next door to check out the fucking castle that was being constructed.

Not truly a castle, but shit! That had to've been the most amazing house I'd ever see.. I wandered through it for 30 minutes in awe, saying not a word. I felt like a little boy again. Overwhelmed by the magnitude of this masterful work of architexture.

Everything about this house was marvelous. The doorknobs were all a dull stainless steel, shaped fancily to look like those from Victorian times. All curvy and shapely. The kitchen was nice. A deep, dusty-tan tile, which looked like aged sandstone, but was smooth to the touch. The cabinets looked ancient, with intentional nicks and tiny cuts in them to make them appear as old as the rest of the place, stained a deep tan as well.

What looked like Victorian lanterns ran the hallways(with lightbulbs, of course) and were placed most strategically in the corners of the larger rooms.

The place had five fireplaces, each of awesome design. Very curvacious and unique.

The study/library had a -beautiful-, what looked to be mahogony(sp?) spiral staircase which lead to a medium sized loft/computer room. Inside the study/library was a secret door! It was built right into the wall, and you couldn't tell it was a door at all. It lead into an area that would take you all the way over to the gameroom. ::drools::

The gameroom.. Yeah. More like a small theater/video arcade! 

There were two ""decks."" I don't really know what you call them since they're not added onto the house, or wooden. They're both a part of the house. I guess the one -upstairs- would be a balcony. So the balcony had this awesome, spiraing sharp tile mural, and directly above it was a ""playhouse"" for the kiddies. Yeah, looked more like a closed-in, windowed gazebo. I imagined chilling out up there with some pillows, some incense, a fine-ass lady, and watching an awesome storm out of the windows. 

They had two,count them, two swimming pools. The largest was shaped like a very fancy and fat ""S"", while the other was more like a diving pool with, get this, a fucking water slide! It must've been fifty feet long, and all curvy and shit!

Other neat features were the built-in handholds in the kiddies' bedrooms which would lead up to a loft/study room, and through that loft you could go into the other kiddies room. A wetbar out back, and a second, smaller kitchen in the second living area/den at the back of the house.

What can I say but: Damn I wish I was filthy, stank-ass rich!

That house/mansion/castle/whatever was so magnificent. I'll likely never forget about it. I need to win the lottery!

WHOOOO!!!

""Hey, what's up?"" It's John, my bro-in-law.

""Not much, bitch. Gonna go get some applications. What up?""

""What kind of work do you want to do?""

""Bro, I think we've been over this a thousand times. Right now I'd just like to get out of fast food.""

""Physical.""

""Riiight?""

""Nine bucks an hour.""

So we talk a little while longer. Nine bucks isn't great. It's really not. I could make more at Sonic, but I hate Sonic. So I chose to give this a try. I start in the morning. Gotta be there at 8.. Apparently these people do multi-million dollar homes. Did Steve Case's, Fabio's and Sandra Bullock's, here in the Austin area.

Recently, though, because life hasn't gone the way I've wanted it to, I've turned into some sort of fuck up.

I've got a couple friends I rarely talk to anymore. I've got one who treats me differently than she used to. I've got another who.. Guh. That's a long story. I've got one who doesn't talk to me anymore, and yet there are others who, when I switch to my old SNs, IM me instantly and are happy to see me because I haven't been around in so long.

All of this because of me, LJ. I know I've said this a hundred times before, but goddamn it, I'm unhappy.

I promised myself that I would be happy one day soon. I'm still heading in that direction, but damn it, I don't want to lose what I have -now- because those I have now are the one's who've helped me through this.

I love my friends, and I want to apologize to them all. I need to stop being such a fucking little bitch.

And I need to stop drinking. When I drink, after I begin to come down from my buzz, I begin to take on the emotion that is most present in my mind. If I'm happy, I continue to stay happy. If I'm horny, same. If I'm creative, yatta yatta. If I'm thinking about how unhappy I am, then I turn into a little bitch. I withdraw from conversations and speak as little as possible, as my mind is running about, going over all of the things that make me unhappy.. Then I say or do something to a friend. I'm not mad or upset with them, I'm just.. being moody. Then they're wondering what's up and upset no doubt, and I get more unhappy because I pissed a friend off.

So I need to stop drinking, I've decided.

Why do I do these things to myself, LJ?

The gears are already turning, slowly. But what truly is strange about it is that I can actually see the light at the end of the tunnel. Oh, right now it's just a tiny little spec. About the head of a needle point, but it's there..

Here's what's starting: I'm working at Sonic again, so I'll not eat anything but chicken sandwiches while on the clock. It's hard not to, believe me. There's so much better-tasting food than plain ol' chicken sandwiches.

I'll be walking in the mornings with my sister, and as soon as I can afford, I'll snag me some Body Solutions. This should help me see my abs again. Ahh.. I remember the time not so long ago.. before I worked fast food. My abs. Yeah, they sure were nice.

Next, I'll be working an hour a day on my math. I'm going to completely retake my GED, because the way they do it now, it works on an overall average score, instead of individual test scores(math, scienc, etc.). So, math for an hour, other subjects for fifteen minutes or so.

After my GED, I'll start up at ACC(Austin Community College), go for two years, then probably move back to Denton and go to North Texas University for two more for my bachelors(or whatever?) in whichever subject.. Who knows.

From there? Not too sure just yet. It could go a million directions, but all of them go -up-.

I'm excited and worried at the same time. So many possibilities, so much room for the floor to drop out.

So it's up to me, and my fucking awesome friends here to keep my punk-ass motivated and up off the floor. Because I'll slip, of this I'm pretty sure. But I'm also sure of you, people. I know you'll keep me from falling.

"event","I feel pretty good today. I woke up early and went outside this morning.. It was quiet. Dew covered everything in sight, and a faint mist was falling. It made me think of my trip to the Grand Canyon, and also of visiting my aunt and uncle up in the Kiamichi Mountains in Oklahoma. 

Oklahoma was awesome, even though the landscape practically mirrors Texas. Well, except when you get up into the mountains. Texas is long, low and flat. 

My grandma had an a-frame cabin up in the mountains some years ago, but after my grandfather died she was convinced to sell it by her kids. I don't think she ever really learned to like the idea that really the last my grandfather bought her was gone.

Anyhow.. I stayed in that cabin a few times, and everytime there was this deer and this freakin' goat who always stayed around the cabin. ::laughs:: They were both amazingly calm. They weren't -tame-, they just weren't threatened by human presence. Up there in the mountains people aren't bothered by the hustle and bustle. They aren't cruel like most teenagers in the 'burbs, because they've been taught to respect nature and the things around them, not because their parents sat them down and said ""Now Johnny, don't go chasing/shooting/scaring the wildlife,"" but because we learn through example, and because that's where they grew up. 

So I go out onto the deck of this a-frame early, early one morning. It's about 5 or 6. Still dark. I mean pitch black. It must've been 5. I could still see the stars, and up in the mountains you could see -ever- star. You could see Mars easily. Anyway. So I'm out on the deck, and here comes that crazy goat. She just walks over to me and stands there, like she knew that I was appreciating all that I saw. ::grins:: That sounds funny, I know, but normally that goat wasn't so quiet. She was almost always making noise. Anyway, the damn deer, a doe I guess, joins me too. It was such a strange event. 

I think often how nice it would be to live in a place like that. Quiet, calm, slow-paced. People just kind of.. strolling through life. Not bothered by the hectic craziness that seems to plague every part of citylife.

But, then also I think how uncool it would be to have to drive an hour and a half to get to the tiny little grocery store. ::laughs:: You want to order a pizza? Forget it. A movie? Nope. Mall? Game store? -Anything?- ::grins:: Think again. That's the drawback. Places like my grandma's a-frame don't mix with citylife. It's one or the other, and the convenience of convenient-living no longer exists.

It's both beautiful and dangerous. You could lose yourself up there because everything's so damn quiet and calm. It really is another world.

Just hope you don't hurt yourself seriously, the nearest hospital is an hour away.

Well, this concludes this episode of ""Lost In Drewspace."" Join in next week for more.

DANGER! DANGER Drew Owens!

So, I'm a sensitive guy, right? I mean, I'm a guy, so I like the ladies. I like flirting and all that mushy shit, but I'm sensitive too.

They're repressed, hard-working people under the rule of zealous religious fanatics, and furthermore, are frightened just as much as we are by the mad factions that inhabit pockets of their land.

So yes, I want to see the enemy dead, but not their innocent. I want to see horrific pictures of a desecrated building where bin Laden once resided, which is now blackened, charred and caked with burned blood. But do I want to see pictures in Time magazine of the innocents in the streets, cradling their dead, innocent children? No.. I've found compassion in my heart that I didn't realize I had. Tears sting my eyes as I write this, because a mixture of anger and sadness weighs heavy on my chest. I've felt helpless for the last day or two now.

The music was decent and loud, but there was too much smoke in the tiny building for me to handle. My eyes were hurting, as well as my chest. So, with beer number eight or nine in hand I stepped out back(it'd been a long night). 

The alley out back stretched both ways, and from down the right side I heard some female voice. Sounded distressed to me. So, I wander over that way, feeling rather good and numb. Turning the corner of this alley I see some guy in a highschool letter jacket, his hands on some chick's shoulders. He looked pissed and she looked scared. He called her a stupid bitch and slapped her, to which I shouted ""Hey, what the hell are you doing?"" or somesuch. 

I proceeded on over to smack Johnny Highschool around, and he greets me with ""Fuck off."" So, after I push him away from the girl and tell her to go, he takes a swing at me. He missed, and I ran him into the wall behind me. I've only gotten into a few fights in my life, but I really don't like it. The fact that someone has the nerve to hit me is something I just can't comprehend.

Anyway, messy details left out, I beat the fucker down, and he hops up and rushes to the street, crying ""Guys, over here!"" I didn't expect that.

They must've just been right around the corner or something, because next thing I know some big, black motherfucker, and four other senior football team thicknecks come around the corner, all with their letter jackets on. I felt like I was in some sort of brat pack 80's flick, or worse, a cheesy 1950's(60's?)play.

Darcy said that I'm no Jackie Chan, which, sadly, is true. Thankfully, though, my years of Shintoshi didn't fail me. I honestly believe that hadn't I ever taken it, I'd've ended up far worse than I did. And strange as it was, my glasses didn't get broken. They fell off just as the brawl was starting, and amazingly didn't get stepped on. 

After the Viper's were done with me, the girl came back. She later said she'd been watching across the street, in another alley. But, when she approached she asked if I was okay. I said I wasn't sure. She said I looked bad. Then told me that what I'd done was the sweetest, most stupid thing she'd ever seen. And, being drunk, I can't recall exactly what I said, but I recall it being something I thought witty and charming, along the lines of ""ignorance may be bliss, but it sure hurts.""

She drove me to the ER, but had to go home, she said. She starts to walk off and I say ""Well?""

""Well what?"" she says.
""Well, don't I get a name and number for my trouble?"" to which she laughed and smiled. Introduced herself as Nicole, gave me her number and told me to call Thursday.

She looked rather young to me. Girls these days can look 24, but they turn out to be 14. So, I wasn't expecting much to come from calling her.

Well, so I called her. Turns out she's almost 19. She asked if she could take me to lunch, I said sure. After I heal up.

So I jump on it. I start working as an apprentice, or trainee, more or less, for his friend Mike. Mike's cool. I dug the office hours, and there were some pretty goddamn fine women in that office, all dressed up in their business wear.

Alright.. So, I do really well working under Mike, and he tells John. John says ""Hey, come move down here. I'll teach you how to work from home, like me."" Sure, I say. 'Cause my sister also told me about a job working for the County that I could get. Good hours, good pay, laid back enviroment. Sounded damn sweet. Me, my mother, and even John thought that that County job was in the hat. I mean, my sister talked to the lady about me getting the job ahead of time, and since she also worked for the County(a different County, but her supervisor is over three seperate small county offices)it'd be a good reference. That's not how it turned out. I -still- don't have that fucking goddamn job. Well.. I didn't have much money to begin with, and I came down ahead of my brother and mother. They were going to get a place together, and I was going to get my own. Yeah. Nice dream, huh?

I get down here, find that all of the sudden there's no one accepting any offers, for me or John, and by that time I'm broke. They're broke. I'd already told my sister how much that fast food job of mine stressed me out.. Of course, I didn't tell her that I'd thought about the big ""S"", but still, I thought it was clear. Anyway, what's she suggest? ""There's a Sonic right down the road. You could get a job there."" You know what? If I wanted to work at a motherfucking fast food joint I could've done that fucking shit in McKinney and saved the last of my money! Not to mention that right now, were I still in McKinney, I'd be working for Mike, and still be making good money. Fuck!!

So.. now I'm finding myself to be a wreck down here. Almost passive-agressive towards some of my friends, and it's pissing me off. Goddamn it. 

Darcy is so good to me. Even when I'm being a bitch for things that're happening around here(not about things she did or said), she's still nice. And she's optimistic in her views of me and my future. Sometimes I just can't help it, though.

I'm not saying that my other friends here aren't nice.. Just that I've talked mostly to Darcy these past few weeks, and really, she's been the only one who's seen me being a bitch like I've been. In case anyone wondered what I was doing at night, just floating there in non-chat area-land, I've been searching the internet for resumes, hoping like hell to find some people I could recruit and make some money off of. I'm so broke it's not funny. 

I'm just a dreamer. Always have my head in the clouds. I want things this way, or that way, but this and that are usually out of reach. 

And Vanessa just mentioned that there's no one near to you(a general ""you"", not you, whomever's reading this)as cool as your friends online. And that's true. I'd love to have friends nearby like those I have here.

Man. Well.. I guess I'm done. I put a lot in there. No doubt a certain person will hit me up about updating this and my wishlist when they next see me. 

I know that I've been a bitch lately, as mentioned earlier. I know I may've been a little passive-aggressive lately, too. I just hope that all of my friends can forgive me for it. As they know, I'm not normally like that. I certainly wasn't that way before moving down here. 

Anyway.. I think that's all."

"event","Z-girl made me think. Have you people out there ever had a conversation with a close friend, you know, just a casual one, and they say something that maybe they had no clue would hurt you, but it did? 

You don't say anything at all to them about it. It's not even brought up, because they were just speaking casually, and them, not thinking it would even have anything at all to do with you.. well, they're not even thinking about it. Does that make sense? I wish I could expand more, but people who may read this knows me.

Ah well. Today(or yesterday, since it's 3 in the morning) was all in all a bad day. I had too much time to myself. When I've got too much time alone, I think a lot.. And when I think a lot, I get depressed about certain things.

I'm not with Miko anymore, but I think about her a lot. Or, not necessarily about her, but about having a girlfriend. I think I crave relationships. Casual sex, while nice, isn't something that's overly satisfying for me. I need to feel wanted by my lover. Like when I told Miko I was moving and she slapped me. I know it sounds weird, but when she slapped me I suddenly felt like she really wanted me with her. I knew by words and expressions that she did, but that slap did, ironically enough, slap some sense(or rather realization -- or more specifically, hindsight realization) into me. The point is, I need more from a relationship than sex. I think from now on it'll be meaningful for me, or nothing at all. I can do without sex, but in a relationship I refuse to do without meaning.

Maybe I'm a strange guy. I hate sports(watching them -- I like playing them), hate wrestling and Nascar. Some of you out there may look at this and laugh, but honestly, down here in Texas, wrestling and Nascar are big. Which is another reason why I want to leave this fucking place. Anyhow, back to my point. Point is, I'm an Aquarius. I guess that explains my romantic and sensitive side. 

I think I've poured out enough for now. Maybe for a while to come, now that I think about it. Hope D isn't right. Hope I don't get addicted to this damn thing, because I sure hate reading boring shit. Not saying you guys' stuff is boring, just that I think surely mine is. 

Well, I'm gone. Need sleep. Night, friends."

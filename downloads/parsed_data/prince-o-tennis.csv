Oh well... where do you go to get your schedual? I suppose I should do that soon... I'd rather play tennis though. BTW.. the name is Ryoma... Echizen... or well... Ryoma Echizen, guess I get a little carried away with the periods. Ha!"

<b>Quote:</b> I'm going to beat you.

<b>Appearance:</b> He's rather short, not even reaching five feet (4' 9"" to be exact), his hair is described as black-green, and he has hazel eyes. He's always wearing a tennis uniform unless he's going to school.. then he wears the school uniform. Most of the time however, he can be found in a FILA everything, hat, shoes, outfit, even his socks are FILA. 

<b>Personality:</b> Ryoma is very confident in his ablities as a tennis player. He's serious and a bit on the shy side at times when meeting people off the tennis courts. He eats, sleeps, and breaths tennis. This driving passion however is only so that he can at some point in the future become good enough to beat his father in a match.  

He is a serious, quiet, untalkative student, though he isn't afraid to stand up for himself or others when they are wronged. He isn't one that is afraid to push the limits in anything, and will often times do just that.

<b>History:</b> Ryoma was a transfer student at Seishun Academy Middle School (Seigaku) which is the school he transferred to from the United States. Though he stayed there for only a few months before transferring once again. His reputation in tennis proceeds him everywhere. Ryoma is a cocky bastard most of the time, feeling that he is better then any opponent he faces on the court. He doesn't have many friends because tennis is his life.

Before he could really get settled at his new school Ryoma's father transferred him again, this time to Rozenkreuz. Ryoma couldn't care less about the classes or the teachers or students, or even where he attends school, all he cares about is tennis... it's his life."

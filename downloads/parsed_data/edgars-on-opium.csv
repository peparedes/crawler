"event","So i was reading up on some of my friends lj's and i got to thinkin....I NEED NEW FRieNDS! Damn, they are all so emo. Its making me sad. They are all like ""blah blah i like this boy but he doesnt like me blah blah i miss her i hate my life blah blah blah blah."" So now it feels like all their depression is rubbing off on me because it makes me feel all shitty. Oh well. I found out my grandmas racist. Haha, thats the funniest thing i think. And im not just guessing it, i know for a fact she is. She even said so herself. Her words exactly are ""im a racist."" Its funny cuz shes old. Fuck! my familys messed up. Patricks a cunt. He called me and told me he was gonna come to my house but he never did. Hmmmm, i think im gonna change the background on my LJ. But what should it be? Maybe a band or a movie thing or some porno....i dont know. I want it to be something creative and neat. hmmmmm. Anna Kournakova is really hot."

"event","Alright, so im in a kind of pissy mood. Yup....im pretty sure steffani hates me now for some reason and if its what happened at deep creak then why did she start hating me afterward? She acted fine the day after, but once school started back up she hates me. Anyway, first of all she ran up to that group thing we stand in before school and was all excited to see patrick and all this ""Saying hey patrick blah blah blah"" and she didnt even say hi or aknowledge me even though i was right next to her. And when she did say something it was ""Did you brush your hair today?"" and i said yes i brush it everyday and she started laughing and said oh then walked away. Plus she totally ignores me and gives me the cold shoulder all the time. If thats not being a bitch than im not really sure what is."

I should probably start it soon. haha, i love procrastination. Ummm, i have a lot of other stuff to say but im kind of insecure to say it on live journal in case somebody i dont want seeing it will. But, i am going to homecoming with heather. Thats gonna be interesting and fun. Personally, i dont like dances. They annoy me, but i guess im doing it for her. She sounded like she really wants to go or something so i wasnt gonna ruin her day. Yeah....Detroit rock city is the best movie ever! Haha, i love it so much. FUCK! i hate mister brown. Hes a fag...literally he is homo. Fallout boy is a really good band! I used to hate them but i actually sat down to listen to them and they are actually really good. My chemical romance is a bad ass band as well. Im not much into hardcore anymore. They only hardcore band i listen to and like is atreyu. I listen to a couple ""screamo"" bands too. Thats basically just funeral for a friend and silverstein. I LOVE THE EMO GAMES!!! I beat the first emo game, the anti-bush emo game and im working on beating the second one. AFter that i only need to beat the 1.5 version (alkaline trio vs. hell) before i beat all of em!! haha, im such a loser. Anyway...i think this is enough for now, i have to go write a project for government."

"event","Brent, you tend to gravitate toward romantic partners who have a Preoccupied attachment style. 

People with a preoccupied attachment style tend to show a great deal of openness and are eager to get close in a relationship. They can be very devoted partners. 

Attachment style begins in infancy with the interactions we have with our parents or primary caregivers. Through these early relationships we begin to understand the dynamics and patterns of close relationships and we carry this perspective into our adult relationships.

Psychologists call your attachment style Fearful Avoidant. 

You tend to have mixed feelings about relationships. A part of you may want to have a close, loving relationship, but another part of you may be somewhat uncomfortable with commitment. It's also likely that you are afraid others will let you down or abandon you. Although you tend to be open to relationships, you may not easily reveal the true you, and potential partners are likely to be intrigued about discovering the person you are deep down."

She is the prettiest thing i have ever seen in my life. Well, i totally have fallen head over heels for her and i hope i feel this way for the rest of my life.Im totally in love with her for the rest of my life! Hmm, geena is calling for rape, but i dont think its considered rape if the victim enjoys it, Heheh. It is hard to find words to say when i am speaking to her. Maybe that is why i never say the right thing when i am with her? Plus she wants to make babies. I think if we did, those would be the most beautiful babies ever in the world. But, i am not ready for children... ""If only we were a little bit older, then we wouldnt have to wait so long"" Thats a beach boys song and i think it fits perfectly for this situation.

Cuz in the dark i can be anybody and look however i want 
Nothing matters when i cant see myself
All is great, and all is flawless in what i call isolation

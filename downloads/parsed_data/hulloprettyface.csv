"event","Yeah, so update I suppose. I forgot I was keeping a going abroad journal and whatever. I haven't got much to say mostly because I'm still here. Haha.


Well, I leave in about two months now and I still need to get my freaking passport and whatnot. I got my housing assignment. 

5B. Small single with sink. Main building. Haha, I told them about my depression and OCD and that's what it got me.

We have to do a first year seminar which is basically like a fun getting to know you class. I got my first choice, Utopia and Dystopia and I'm very excited. I can't wait to go though I really don't want to leave Joe. But, hopefully, it'll be alright. Hopefully. :p"

"event","So, I'm starting to get nervous about going to the UK. Like, I'm reading on sites about how they're going to ask me if I have enough money for my courses and if I don't they won't let me in. It's weird. Just like they're talking about how if I go there on a student visa, it'll be amazingly hard to change it and stay longer. I'll have to figure it out considering I'm hoping to stay in the UK permanently.

I don't know. It weirds me out. Just like everyone thinking that I'm not going to go to Richmond. It's like, umm, yeah? It's my top college, why wouldn't I go? Whatever. It's dumb."

"event","Yeah so....I was thinking that maybe I'll take a picture of my envelope that Richmond sent me along with the Christmas card of the campus. Thought it might be nice to kick off pictures with that perhaps. I need to get added by my bestest friends and stuff. Yes yes."

"event","Okay, new journal. It's always odd, starting a new journal and leaving one in the dust. Whatever.

it started a week ago. I got accepted to Richmond, in England...they gave me money. :p $28,000 over four years. I said I'd take it so....I'm going to their school. I leave sometime in August. 

I want this to be my best year yet. I want to road trip this summer, badly. I'll bring a tent and some gas money and it'll be grand. 

I need to still get a passport and student entry and such. And! My mum's company may be buying me my computer I want. Woot, yeah for pink computers. I like the vaio TX or the vaio C which I can get in pink. Yum.

I'll start keeping up this as things progress. Mhmm. Oh,and if you want to have me mail you a Christmas card next year, comment with your addy and I'll send you one from London. :D"

"event","<P>It's about time that I did a decent update on here, I never really written a big long thing on here so I guess tonight's the night.&nbsp; Have now realised I don't have anythin to say, yet again, so I may ramble.</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Read on if you have the courage...""> </P>
<P>I applied for yet another job today at Vodafone, it would be absolutely perfect so I'm really hoping that they at least have the decency to get back to me, unlike various other places.&nbsp; Damn the eternal paradox that is employment, you can't get a job without experience, and you can't get experience because...you don't have experience.&nbsp; It's all a bit pathetic if you ask me, but I guess that's life.</P>
<P>In recent weeks I have finally come to appreciate the value of EMA, two years too late.&nbsp; Perhaps if I'd had a brain two years ago I would have thought to save something for this time because now I'm suffering the consequences of being stupid and *thinks of word* frivolous.&nbsp; Ah well, at times like these one must also recognise that there are benefits of my current conundrum...</P>
<OL>
<LI>I don't have any money to spend on fast food, sweets and general crap that will make me even lardier.</LI>
<LI>... there isn't a number 2 really</LI></OL>
<P>Also, I would like to take this moment to point out that my number 1 doesn't really count, as I just scoff all the crap that's in the house.&nbsp; Can't afford to go swimming&nbsp;either.</P>
<P>Ah, I&nbsp;knew I had another paradox to tell you, and it is this.&nbsp; Whenever I have money, there isn't much I wanna buy, and when&nbsp;I'm skint as skint can be there's loads.&nbsp; I spose its just a wanting what&nbsp;you can't have kinda thing, but for the sake of arguement, let us call it a paradox.</P>
<P>There have also been some scary&nbsp;things occuring which I'm hoping are just many many coincidences.&nbsp; Things keep happening, like I'll imagine my auntie driving around the corner but not in her car, and she does, and I'll think about someone and they'll phone.&nbsp; There's been loads of things but most are too mundane to remember, but it seems like theres far too many to be just coincidences, and maybe could be slightly psychic.&nbsp; I know that sounds silly but if you could be in my head when it happens you'd see what I mean.</P>
<P>Anyway, I think I've scared you enough now, so I shall shush.&nbsp; Byeeeee.</P>"

<P>This is about the extent of my day, sleep in for a bit, do some random chore, have a mooch on t'internet, eat and go back to sleep.&nbsp; Once this summer school thing is over with, I'll probs continue with the job hunt, and the swimming, and possibly develop some strange hobby which I have not decided on yet hehe.&nbsp; Anything just to pass the time.</P>
<P>I'm finding it very strange and tumbleweedesque bein out of college again.&nbsp; At least last year, I knew what to expect when the new term started, but now its all unchartered territory and its slightly scaring the bejesus outta me.&nbsp; I'm sure things will be ok, tis just a simple matter of working out the right mentality before facing the situation.&nbsp; See, I could be my own Guru.</P>
<P>Think my washing is done now, so I shall moggy off and peg it out.&nbsp; Yay me!</P>"

"event","Finally we have the latest instalment of the wonderful life of Shalooley!  The exams are finally over (repetition of ""finally"" must buy thesaurus) and yonder me is...finally...free of academicness, well, for a bit at least.  So, how does the Shalooley feel?  Miffed.  Yet again she is forced into non-celebration mode and it schtenks.  Same thing happened with my birthday (twas only my 18th, not like it was special or anything) and ergo mucho deja vu.

However, shall not sulk, shall never have to sit another A Level exam ever again which is obviously something to smile my face into oblivion about.  Who needs fun when you have sod all to do all day?  Not me, apparently.

Regardless, will get over it.  Bigger fish to fry etc etc, and if one doesn't fry ones fish before the use by date ones fish begins to schtenk.  So ones forms shall be filled in (fun), ones college work shall be sorted and probably disposed of (more fun) and maybe be forced into watching crappy Dragonball Z all day (yes, you guessed it, even more fun).

Gawd I'm bored"

"event","I'm going driving again today!!!!!  Yay!  Spose I'm really sad coz I like the nearly death-ness that is driving but oh well.

Speaking of driving, tis the European Grand Prix this weekend...Friday practise 1 starts in about 5 mins!  Yay!

After this we have Canada, USA, France n then finally rule Britannia the racing boys are coming to Silverstone!!!!!!!  After careful consideration it has occured to me that is Schumacher the Goit crashes (again) in the next two races, and Jenson wins them both, he will be two points ahead in the championship.  That would be nice.

Anyway, for those strange individuals who for reasons unjustified do not like F1, here is other news...

"event","As will have been seen if people watched it, 2004's Monte Carlo Grand Prix was nothing short of sensational, as usual.

Michael Schumacher's chain of victorys was smashed (quite literally when he decided to randomly brake/smush Montoya in the Tunnel...daft prat.

Many other incidents resulting in only 10 drivers finishing, clouds of smoke, smushed nose cones, upsidedown-ness and wheels at right angles with forwardness.

Piece de resistance has to be that owing to his superbnessnessness, Jenson was only 0.4 secs away from winning!  One more lap n victory would have been his.  There's always next time though, in the form of the European Grand Prix NEXT WEEK!!!!!!"

"event","I am suprisingly hangover free!  I tell you, I may have found the perfect way to get completely n utterly mindlessly squiffy without a hangover...in the form of many many pitchers of cocktails.  Tis pretty, tastes nice plus you have the added lovliness of sharing...yeah, ok, the added lovliness of being tres drunk.  The sharing is good tho, coz it costs like nearly nowt!

So anyway, friday was until the alcohol rather an emotional day, and after the alcohol it just seemed like any normal drinking frenzy.  Saturday is a little different, not emotional, but do feel slightly bewildered and rather small n vulnerable at the fact that don't have safety net-esque college any more.  I suppose the emotion will only really hit for me on Monday, when obv i dont need to go to college.  That will be wierd.

However, there shall be emotion today, as it is the F1 qualifying for the Monte Carlo Grand Prix!  Go Jenson!  Love Monte Carlo, its all in the streets and theres a big tunnel.  Rather unique track.  there is also no podium, but the top 3 drivers stand on these big steps and its all very...grand.  Race day is tomorrow, cant wait!

Anyway, gonna shush now coz its nearly time for the quals.  Byeee!"

"event","Hullo, tis Shalooley!  If you know me, hi!  If you don't...well...hi!  After two long (yet at the same time short) years I have returned to tumbleweed status...neither here nor there, owing to the fact that I have just had my LAST EVER COLLEGE LESSON!!!!!!!  Very sad about that, but at same time totally extatic bordering on hysterical.  Deary me.  Just gotta come in for 7 exams, which ain't that bad really, but obv tis 7 more than I wanna have hehe.  Ah well soon be over.

Given that, will soon have to find a job and that seems scarier even than doing exams.  See, I ain't moving out for uni int 1st year, and so although will be comparatively living in the lap of luxury, I will unless I have a job have to use all my loan on getting the bleedin train everyday, n obv don't wanna do that.  Some of us have cars to buy you know.  So job it is.  However, une autre probleme, there are no jobs in my town, coz any part time jobs are during the week which obv being a student can't do.  Can't get a job in uni city because t'will defeat object of getting job, because will have to spend wages going to anf from work.  Smells.  Really does.

So, tis nearly time to sit be, relax, be skint n watch all my buddies trail off into the sunset...oh ok, to the motorway but you know wot I mean.  Ho hum.

NO MORE COLLEGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BOOHOO BUT ALSO YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

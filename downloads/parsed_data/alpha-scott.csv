"event","So it's been a few days, things have calmed down and recent events have had a chance to settle into people's minds. <lj-cut text=""So what's the state of the pack?"">So what's the state of the pack?

Good, I think.  Zane stepped up to the plate nicely and that's something the pack needed to see.  Hell, it's something /I/ needed to see.  There was too much totally inappropriate emphasis on 'family' and Zane being some kind of daddy to everyone who skinned their knee.  No. He's not.  He's the Ulfric.  An Ulfric needs to be hard though it should ideally be tempered by kindness.  For too long he was acting kind, being forced to resort to hardness.  It's a subtle difference but an important one.  People will come to expect the 'default state'.  And while the latter might be good for raising children, it's disaster when leading Lukoi.  

We'll be the stronger for this.  We lost seven Lukoi over this.  In a pack of less than sixty, that's a good number.  How many would we have lost if David had another month to garner support?  Twice as many?  Half the pack?  There can only be one Ulfric in a pack.  Now there /is/ only one Ulfric in the pack.  

Everyone made their choices.  Everyone knew they were free to leave had they decided to.  And now we move on, down a single road of the Ulfric's choice.  And those who don't like it are still welcome to leave peacefully with no deaths being required unless they choose to force the issue.

Already we found another wolf in our territory.  Confused, unhappy, lonely.  She'll be taught the way of the Lukoi and the pack will grow stronger.  That's how it works."

"event","Well, that was traumatic for all concerned.  <lj-cut text=""Though for some more than others."">

Zane won as I thought he would.   David was a strong fighter as I already knew he was and in a fight to the death, it can only take one small mistake.  I was by no means certain however.  But the real surprise came after.

I would have put money down that Zane would spare those supporting the Fenrir.  As it turns out, I would have lost a sizable amount.  He killed all the alphas and that was... difficult to watch in some ways.  It's one thing to kill someone in a fight.  To kill three others in cold blood after it's over is another matter.

But they made their choices.  Freely and of their own will, they chose to betray the Ulfric and support the Fenrir.  The one I feel worst about is Brigid however.  Had she not been mated to David, would she have declared for the Fenrir?  I don't know.  But she stood by her mate as I would have expected her to and she paid for that loyalty with her life.  Out of all the alphas and betas who are no longer part of the pack as a result of this, she is the one I would have liked to see remain part of it.

I think I'll go curl up with Waylon now.  It's been a tiring day."

"event","So.  It's come to this.  And it's about time.  David's declared himself Fenrir with, I admit, my urging.  He's been bucking Zane and the direction this pack has been taking ever since it's started to get back on track.  And enough is enough.

<lj-cut text=""Crescendo"">
When he challenged me for Freki, I set the terms and time for the challenge but then I realized something; it would change nothing.  Zane's forbidden killing in challenges for rank or dominance so most likely we'd both come out of it alive.  If I won, and I do think I would since I have a decade's more experience fighting as a wolf than David has especially since he spent half his time as a therian in a safe house, it wouldn't change anything.  David would still be Geri and bucking Zane.  If he won?  He'd wait to heal then challenge Zane down the road.

Both options were unacceptable.  This needed to be resolved now.  And honestly?  Zane needs to prove he can handle being Ulfric for real especially after the way things have been going.  So I submitted to David without a fight, giving him Freki on the condition he'd declare himself Fenrir.  And he did.  The pack was already fracturing; now the lines will be drawn.  One way or another, there will be one direction in this pack.  Strength or weakness.

Fortunately, I don't accumulate much junk.  CDs and DVDs are packed up already.  If David wins, I doubt I'll stay even if he won't kill me for supporting Zane.  He doesn't have a clue what being Lukoi means.  If Zane wins he might want to kill me for letting David step by me without a fight for the express purpose of challenging him.  In either case, the winner will be badly hurt and easily killed if he threatens me or Waylon.  We'll have time to leave if we need to whatever happens.

And no, I won't be Ulfric no matter what happens here.  And hell, even if I stay in San Francisco and Zane wins, I might not hold any rank any more since I refused to fight for him.  There's no doubt in my mind though that this was the right thing to do and I'll deal with the consequences, whatever they are."

I'm wondering if I've had enough of it too.  It's gotten to the point that I not only dislike some of the pack - nothing new there - but I don't even trust some of them.  I'm not sure I'd lift a finger for them either.  That's not a good attitude for a Freki to have.  Then again, they brought it on themselves.  But maybe it's time to take a vacation myself once Zane gets back.  Let him deal with it and I'll scope out New York, show Waylon around and introduce him to friends and family.  And if the pack isn't 'fixed' or on the way when we get back...  Eh.  We'll see.

Heh.  I could have become Ulfric in Oregon except I would certainly never have done that to Waylon.  Peter should have it well in hand, especially with Morgan to help him.  Shame it was Morgan who left and not some others."

"event","<lj-cut text=""And my mood has been even more rare."">

It's difficult to reconcile being extremely happy at the same exact time there's reason to want to tear the throats out of dozens of people.  Life's funny that way.  Waylon's been... Well, not a calming influence but he does keep me from getting locked into a cycle of ever increasing fury over what's been happening.  Not to mention a definite stress reliever.  (Zane really needs a Lupa before he breaks.)

And he's certainly given me a different perspective.  It's interesting to see the pack through his eyes.  Interesting and disturbing.  When did we get so weak?  Undisciplined?  I can't pinpoint it.  It's been a gradual thing, happening a little bit at a time, one small minor breakdown that's almost unnoticeable followed by another and another until we arrive at our present chaos.  It's not all bad, far from it.  We're doing a lot of things right, trying to make the pack a good place for all the wolves, not just those who can enforce their will.  We've just gone too far in spots.  I'm not blameless.  Discipline flows down from the top and I'm right near the top. Every so often Zane asks me if he's being too lenient.  The last time (couple times?) I said yes.  But the next time he asks me, assuming he does, I'm going to say 'hell yes'.

When he does nothing he sets an example of what's acceptable practice.  Every dominant wolf sets an example for those under them.  It all goes in some giant database labeled 'acceptable behavior' until it snowballs out of control and everything falls apart.  I've noticed this for a while but recently it's become obvious just how bad it's become.  We're therians damn it not the Girl Scouts.

And now a pup's been taken by Waylon's former pack.  They seem to think we don't have the will or strength to take her back.  Their spy wasn't here long enough to really get an impression of weakness except that we obviously don't consider 'might makes right' to be SOP.  That of itself is enough for them to think they can win.  They're wrong.  And we'll prove it on their bodies. 

And speaking of bodies, I arranged with Lee to spar with her myself.  I try to get there at least five times a week, an hour a day.  it's a pain in the ass making the time.  And I really hate sparring.  I'm a lover not a fighter by inclination.  But it's necessary.  And I haven't spread it about either that I'm doing so.  Let it be a surprise if anyone thinks to challenge me.</lj-cut>"

Waylon moved in the other day.  This pleases me greatly.  We're not making much noise about it.  I think half the pack assumed we were already living together anyway.  Which we effectively were after that challenge of his and the knife wound.  Once he no longer needed supervision, he just didn't move back out.

So we had a talk, we agreed, and that was that.  How fast it went. How strange.  I just have to make sure I never give the appearance of playing favorites.  Waylon knows I can't.  Hell, he knows I won't and would resent it if I tried anyway.

"event","I've been thinking about power a lot lately.  No surprise, right?  In many ways, power goes hand in hand with dominance and submission which was the subject of the last entry.  Though in this case, I mean literal power and not power over someone.

<lj-cut text=""Cut because I don't like spamming my own page with lots of crap."">
Power, as pertaining to therians, comes in many levels that are not easily defined.  The designation between alpha and beta is pretty arbitrary.  Some have enough power that they obviously fall into the category 'alpha' while some are so weak there's no question that 'beta' is theirs.  The line between 'weak alpha' and 'strong beta' though is blurry especially when you factor in personality.  What's the difference between a beta strong in power and will and an alpha who's weak in both?  The beta will probably come out ahead unless the alpha has some hidden reserves.

Taking any pack as an example, it's fairly obvious there's no correspondence between power level and personality.  Some very intense people are technically betas while some alphas are what I would kindly call wimps.  So it seems reasonable to assume that what level of power someone ends up with is determined just by a roll of the dice.

I also don't think power grows in strength over time.  I think you get what you get even if it's not immediately obvious.  It's more learning how to tap your potential than anything else.  I've noticed this in myself since I arrived in San Francisco.  Prior to this, I was always content to just let things happen as they would.  Course, back in New York, I was a kid.  An alpha, yes but still a kid.  And even as I got older I was still considered by so many people to be 'the kid'.  Hell, I even thought of myself that way sometimes.

Then I went off to college but I knew it was just transitory.  I was part of the pack of course but I knew I was, in effect, just passing through.  Even if it would take a few years.  I was busy with college and then culinary school and having fun in general so I wasn't all that interested in who ran the pack or presenting myself as a potential challenger.

But here, I'm here to stay.  This is my pack.  And first I was the Geri and now I'm the Freki and I seem to be getting stronger as time goes on.  At least Lee has said I feel stronger to her.  From in here, it feels much the same.  And while I've noticed I'm getting better at some things, I was just putting it down to practice.

The point?  I don't think my power is growing so much as it's starting to manifest fully.  I'm beginning to use my full potential.  I have reason to be all that I can be, to steal a phrase from the Army.  Had I just stayed the kid, just another alpha with no real ambition, I probably wouldn't be this powerful now.  Hell, it took me eleven years to reach this level.  Actually, no. It took me one year to reach this level.  It took ten years to develop a reason to.

This also explains why so many other people in the pack are growing in power.  The pack hasn't had a stable structure in a year.  People are still jockeying for position, new wolves are showing up and joining, positions are being filled.  But also, we want people to gain in strength and are not beating them down to make sure they know their place.  We're building a pack up from nothing and need every member to be as good as he can be so we're safe from outside threats.  That fosters growth and might explain why more established packs don't often have something similar happening.  

Or not.  I could be wrong.  The reasons don't really matter I suppose, only the result.  And the result is I'm stronger and the pack is stronger."

"event","That's a good title for this entry, I think.  If anyone ever finds this they'll eagerly read it looking for the good stuff.  Sorry phantom future reader: no sex.  Not that kind of dominance. Well, not unless I ramble off into that direction which I'm not planning on doing at the moment.  Keep reading though; who knows where I'll end up.

<lj-cut text=""Warning: deep thoughts ahead."">It's interesting to look at this pack through the eyes of another.  I was here as we gradually evolved and grew into what we have now.  To someone who steps into it from wildly different circumstances, it seems strange and bizarre.  Revolutionary?  Weak?  Certainly we're one of the more liberal packs I know of.  New York's wasn't anything I'd complain about but looking back on it, I can see how they kept a much stricter protocol than we do here in many ways.  That's not a bad thing either.

I've been spending a lot of time with Waylon for reasons I don't need to get into.  That's not so much because they're irrelevant to this entry but rather because they're totally obvious. (Note to future reader: SEX.) (Okay and other things as well.)  Anyway, he comes from a pack full of inbred, macho assholes who don't wear sheets on their head probably only because they live in Oregon and not Alabama.  So he's been surprised, shocked, bewildered (insert nine other adjectives here) by how we do things here.  And the more I see his reaction to it, and the more I explain how it works, the more I see it anew.

Lets take formal greetings as an example since that's a subject that's come up very recently.  I don't insist on them usually.  Despite that, I always greet Zane formally the first time I see him that day and often other times as well.    I do so because he deserves that recognition of his status.  He deserves it not just because he is Ulfric but as far as I'm concerned, he deserves to be Ulfric.  So I tell him that whenever I see him by publicly submitting to him.

At the same time, I don't insist those below me greet me that way so long as they do so in other, respectful ways.  Why?  Several reasons.  Certainly, I enjoy the formal display of submission.  It's a great ego boost and makes my wolfly instincts purr (so to speak).  It feels good to have people submit and acknowledge my place over them.  Rar.  On the other hand, I'm therian.  I'm no more a wolf than I am human.  I'm the best of both worlds.  And I don't have to be ruled solely by my instincts though I certainly pay attention to them and give them their due.

I can be patient.  I can accept other, more subtle, shows of submission and deference.  I don't need to reinforce my own sense of self-worth on the bodies of others.  Being dominant is as much, if not more, responsibility as privilege.  Being therian isn't license to be an animal.  It's an opportunity to be greater than a human. 

I am therian, hear me roar. (I just couldn't resist putting that in.)"

Come join the Lobos Creek Pack. 

Actually, that sounds more like a complaint than I meant it to be.  We've just had a very large influx of wolves in the last three or four months and some of them aren't exactly what I'd call USDA Prime.  On the other hand, some of them have some definite possibilities.  I suppose I can't expect every new addition to the pack to be an ex Navy Seal.  So we'll just have to train our own.

The new rankers have taken their positions and are currently in the 'learn on the job' stage.  I'd be almost pissed at Jared and Meri for leaving except that 1) Zane asked them to and 2) becoming the new Ulfric and Lupa of that city is a definite step up.  I'm as certain as I can be that that's going to be how things end up even if they don't think so yet.  I suppose Texas isn't that far away to visit...

So Jolene is gone.  Again.  And this time she managed to get herself killed.  Can anyone not have seen this coming?  Kipling said it best: For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  Jolene was constantly running away from the pack.  She was constantly insisting on doing everything alone.  She left her strength behind, once again, and she died for it.  It's a shame.  It's sad.  But it's not surprising.  It was inevitable.

And now she's inflicted this on the pack and Zane and all those who cared for her.  I suppose she can serve as a lesson: one wolf alone is weak.  The strength of the wolf is the pack.  Ah well.  People will grieve and move on and I shall say not a word.  I don't want to give Zane a reason to tear my throat out and I'm sure he's upset enough as it is.

The only question is, now who will be Lupa?  Someone who will care enough about the pack to actually be part of the pack in all ways.  Poor Zane; his duty is to replace Jolene as soon as possible in order to give the pack a Lupa.  Hopefully he'll wait and choose more wisely."

Another year, more stuff.  Which makes perfect sense since it's entirely arbitrary anyway what day the new year starts.  I'm just glad it's finally all over and we can move past the whole 'holiday season' thing.  What a crock.  I'd rather be extra nice when it's not expected of me.

One good thing did come out of it though.  Well, one /really/ good thing.  All the presents were nice but the one thing that wasn't even a holiday present that absolutely thrills me is a new car.  Grace decided to get rid of the fleet of vehicles she inherited from the pack and I just couldn't resist.  I had a very sensible van for the business so when it appeared on that list... I just had to.  A bright red 2002 Corvette.  Convertible.  Vroom!  I need to go for a drive.  A very fast drive.  A very fast, very long drive.

Except Zane is away and I can't.  Just shoot me now 'cause I so don't want to deal with this and if he were here I'd just yell to him and let him deal with it instead.  But nooooooooooo.  He had to go on a recruiting vacation just when Jolene decides to punish Nesto.  Not a problem, right?  After all, he deserved it.  But why, why why why? Did she involve non-pack?  I'm sorry but God damned pack business stays pack business and you don't bring in your local Master of the City or even some cat.

You don't act like they're pack, you don't involve them in testing pups, you don't involve them in punishing wolves, you don't.  You.  Just.  Don't.  And I'm not going to let it go either so now I get to try to figure out how to deal with the Lupa.  She who speaks with Zane's voice.  She who runs away from the pack once a month or more.

Just shoot me.

And to make it even better?  Justice is taking off for Africa any day now for who knows how long.

(OOC: thanks to <lj user=""rotting_jazz""> for the picture.)

It's been a busy month since I last wrote something in this.  Every time I begin to feel that the pack's problems are ending, something new pops up: two problems fixed, one new one rears its head and several not really problems show up to just distract from everything else.  Sure, we're getting somewhere but it's an effort.

On the plus side, both Daine and Nahele are now adult wolves.  Even more on the plus side, Nahele can now have the stupid beat out of him to use one of Zane's favorite phrases.  Not that I dislike the guy but he can be a royal pain in the ass and gods does he whine.  And now he has a kid.  For both their sakes, I hope it's not really his.  A child is not the mean by which you should be forced to grow up.  Well, it'll work out in the end.  He's not a bad guy and eventually he'll figure out he doesn't need to be so defensive about everything.

A big, major huge mark in the plus column is several Humans Fist members being arrested.  That guy we kidnapped worked out beautifully.  The vampire played with his mind and turned him into a nice, remorseful ex-fanatic who just had to confess everything to the cops.  Illegal?  Sure.  But it beats killing him and all the others.  Down side, while several got arrested, a couple didn't and are on the run including the one I identified by her picture.  Mona.  There's a APB on her among the pack as well as the police and if anyone spots her, they're to call the cops.

Next on the plus side... Okay, there's no plus here.  At all.  I'm at a complete loss on how to deal with Jolene now.  She tortured someone.  For money.  She skinned her alive and made certain she didn't get infected so she'd live.  Not out of kindness but so she'd suffer more.  And she cauterized it all, permanently disfiguring her on top of it all.  That's like worse than what the vampires did to Grace and Aubrey.  At least shifters will grow their skin back and heal from it.  They aren't scarred for life and have to live with it.  I just couldn't condone killing this woman just because she tried to kill Jolene. yes, she's the Lupa.  Yes, she's pack.   But I'd have tried to kill her to if it was me or anyone I cared about.  Hell, I /did/ kill the ones who flayed Aubrey alive (and did everything else to her).

Zane agreed to let me try to talk to this woman. Cassidy is her name.  I gave it to Meri to find her if possible.  See if we could come ot some kind of arrangement, some kind of restitution.  I can stop worrying about it though as it's already been taken care of.  She attacked Jolene again and died in the process, almost killing the Lupa.  Almost.  She got better.  And now I have to decide how to deal with her.  I've been all over Lee's ass for the atrocities she's committed and now Jolene's joined the ranks of the monsters.  I know she regrets it though.  I heard her when she was telling people why this woman wanted her dead.  I think I just have to ask her point blank if she'd ever do something like that again.  Some prices are just too high to pay even for one's own survival.  If she regrets what she did, was willing to atone for it somehow, and would never do it again... I can probably live with that.  That's something Lee could never answer when I asked if she'd ever do it again.  I can forgive past actions but the person can't still be willing to do it again if the occassion rises.

What else... Oh, of course.  Justice.  He's back in town and I'm very glad to see him again.  I could really get serious about him if he ever stuck around long enough for it to happen.  As it is, I really enjoy spending time with him.  We talked once about the possibility of him 'settling down', maybe when he gets back from Africa.  If he does, we'll see what happens.  If not?  I'll enjoy as much of him as I can and settle for a good friendship.  With benefits.

Speaking of friends with benefits... They're nice to have, especially among pack members.  Pack is so close it's really enjoyable to be able to be close on another level too, especially such a fun and pleasurable one.  But I think I'm ready to have something more with the right person.  Not that I'd automatically become monogamous unless that's what the theoretical SO wants.  I can probably go either way but I don't insist on a sole commitment.  I separate sex and love.  They're best when combined but either is great solo.

David.  He'd be fun to have some 'benefits' with but I doubt that'll happen.  He is so majorly screwed up, forced to rely on just himself in that safe house.  Probably forced to rely on just himself in the gang too.  He doesn't really know how to let others in or to accept help.  But maybe, just maybe, I got him to agree to try.  Well, he did agree but maybe he'll actually manage to succeed.  Madi's going to be the main person in that since they're together but I intend to help as much as possible.  I really don't want to see anyone else disemboweled in dominance squabbles.  And speaking of Grace and squabbles...

Keahi was there for it.  Have I mentioned this month how I dislike having him around our territory?  Forget about personality conflicts, he's the head promoter and condoner of the vampire's sick society.  It's cruel and degrading where torture is not only accepted but seems to be expected at times.  I'd be very happy if all of the pack stayed far away from it and anyone who buys into their party line.  And yet there he is.  I can accept that as Grace's husband he's going to show up on occasion.  Fine.  I'll grin and bear it.  I don't have to like it.  But he was also there for Nahele's test and I had, and have, a major fucking problem with that.

The test was for Nahele to learn to trust his pack.  Not to learn to trust vampires and Keahi in particular.  Keahi isn't pack.  Period.  It's Nahele's choice whether to like him or not and it's not for us to force him to change his mind.  Had he spoken up and refused, I'd have backed him up too.  Meri and Zane had no problem with him being there though but it really pissed me off to see him taking part of a pup's test.  I remember Zane going on about how Silver would not be a good choice for Ulfric since he was tied too closely to the vampires.  He condemned Silver for asking Lee to step in when the mansion was attacked.  And now he's inviting vampires to help test pups.  What's wrong with this picture?

I was going to talk to him about it too but then Jolene ended up in the hospital and one thing led to another and blah blah blah.  And speaking of ties to vampires, I'm now inclined against having Faith as vargamor.  We're already ending up too tied to them, now even on the part of the Ulfric!  It's not that I don't trust Hariel.  I actually do.  As far as I know, he stays away from court when he can and doesn't buy into their party line.  But he's not a free man.  He answers to Keahi and will do what he's ordered to.  Or if not Keahi, then whoever kills Keahi and takes over.

We could always 'fire' her I guess if that ever happened but... Well, there's time.  She needs to actually learn to be a witch or shaman or whatever she calls herself.  She's certainly not qualified now and maybe someone else will come along who is, who we also learn to trust and isn't bonded to, in love with, a vampire.  Though with the way things are going, s/he'll be in a polygamous relationship with a hyena and snake and have just as many conflicting ties.

November is here.  Fall is here.  Stuff happens, has happened.  Is happening, will happen.  What stuff?  Let's see...

Bo is dead.  Good.  Betraying the pack is never a good idea and that was the only possible outcome the moment he decided to do it.  Knowing who took care of it, I'm sure it was quick.  One problem solved and he can explain to the munin just why he did what he did.

Nahele didn't pass the little test I gave him to see if he was ready to do without an Eros.  I'm hardly surprised.  Almost three hours of teasing and denial... Good practice for him though and he held out nicely.  I wouldn't be surprised if he passes next time.  Was fun too.

Halloween was boring.  I stayed in and did nothing.  Going out to a public party when you have a huge bullseye on your chest is so not a good idea.  The day after Halloween was fun though.  The pack had its own private party at a posh restaurant and most everyone was in costume.  I dragged out (literally!) a costume I hadn't worn in years.  I once dated a drag queen (he was an actual performer and only dressed in drag professionally) who once convinced me to dress up one year for a party.  So I still have my Dame Edna clothing including the wig and eyeglasses.  Though it was a little snug since i've put on muscle, it still fit well.  Back in the closet it goes for another few years.

There's three new pups now for a total of five.  A few new wolves still guests and a few old wolves still guests.  The pack is getting larger despite everything Humans First is doing.  Hell, two of the pups are because of them.  At this rate, they're creating more therians than killing them.  May they all burn in the Hell they probably believe in.  Though I'll settle for them just feeding the worms.

I've been spending some time with Lee.  No, really.  The former Master of the City.  I feel sorry for her.  She's still hurting over the loss of Silver and I really hate to see anyone suffer.  Even the former master torturer of the vampire.  Gods, how I loathe their society.  Their cruel, degrading, customs that ape all the very worst things about feudal times.  And their willingness to commit atrocities.  Get them individually away from that shit and they're no worse than anyone else though. They don't have to dance to a ballet written by some vampiric predecessor of the Marquis de Sade.

I'm not easy around her though.  She calls wolves.  I hate that.  She's a threat ; the hyenas during the war is a perfect example of why.  Being forced to do that kind of thing is worse than death.  And I told her all that too.  I'm a lousy politician.  I like blunt honesty so everyone knows where they stand.  And then she even agreed with a bunch of it.  That's part of why I feel sorry for her.  She was kidnapped as a girl, killed and turned then tortured into becoming a good little vampire.  How can that not tear your heart?  Especially when she's got holes in her power still raw from Silver's death.

I can see why David spends time with her.  Plus she lets him try to beat the hell out of her.  He can't but that means he can just let go and get all the rage out.  I suppose that's one way of not dealing with it.  There are worse ways.  Anyway, she's also staying away from the other vampires.  I can certainly understand why.  That she can see how cruel they are and actually regret it is the sad part.

Eh.  Talking to her gives me something to do since I'm not working at all.  If the HF threat doesn't end soon I'm going to go crazy and end up killing something.  Or someone.  I just hope its the right someone."

"event","Isn't being shot supposed to make you angry?  I'm not happy about, of course.  And I am kind of angry but I'm not furious.  Maybe it's because I was expecting it.  Sort of.  I've known for a long time people hated me just because of what I was.  I've known for a long time that they wanted me dead and that there were people willing to do it.  Hell, they've joined an organization whose only purpose is to kill preternaturals.  Add in that we had some warnings and it didn't come as a huge surprise.  But they failed.  We won.  This round.  Now it's our turn and I'm glad I'm not really angry about it.

We will find the people who tried to kill me and Jared.  We'll find all of them who are planning to kill us, not for anything we've done to them but only because we exist.  And I'm quite willing to quickly and cleanly kill them to make sure they don't try it again.  They started this and I'm not going to let them hurt those I care about.  But I'm not even tempted to 'make them pay' for what they've done.  I don't want them to suffer; I just want them gone.  If the cops can't do it, I will.  And I'm glad I'm not angry enough to lose sight of who I am.  Any time I'm tempted to give in to that kind of thing, I just think about what the vampires do.  I remember Bade crucified, I think about Grace and Aubrey being flayed alive.  The day I sink to that level is the day I hope someone kills me.

I'll have to make sure Zane knows that."

"event","Having a whole poked through you with a silver needle hurts.  Imagine that.  <lj-cut text=""Details and more."">

So Seth and I went down to the place where Meri got her tattoo done.  I looked over what was available and picked out a simple, silver nipple ring.  Nothing fancy.  The procedure itself was ridiculously easy: needle meets nipple, nipple loses.  Ow.

The ring followed instantly but instead of being withdrawn like the needle was, it stayed there.  The silver ring.  Ow.  Sure, that was what I signed up for but having a piece of silver inside of you feels a little different from having it outside.  'It burn!  It burns us!' as Gollum said.

It's... interesting.  Painful.  Stimulating.  And I can't wait till it's healed - as healed as it's going to get, that is - to see what it'll feel like in more erotic situation.  And even better, it looks damn good on me.  It took me some extra time falling asleep with it last night.  Tonight too which is why I'm writing this.  It'll distract me.

I do manage to ignore it every so often.  Like when Lucas showed up at the mansion.  It was great seeing him again and I'm glad he's here to visit.  Maybe he can help Aubrey get over... No, you don't 'get over' that kind of thing.  Maybe he can help her deal with what happened to her.  

I finally mentioned to Zane the support group thing with her and Grace then left it to him to decide.  He's the shrink, not me.  So I wouldn't forget again, I whispered it quick during that party Bo threw.  Fun little get together.  Good food.  Very nice mural.  Though honestly?  I don't really approve of it.  It's static.  It's like a family photo which is fine but family photos can be taken again when someone new enters it.  The mural is a done deal and any new wolf will suddenly be excluded from it.  Maybe a panel can be added to the center?  I'll have to inspect it more closely and see how it's made.

And now since I'm yawning, it's time to try to go to sleep again. Ryan's already asleep in the bed and I was careful not to wake him getting out of it.  

...

Oh.  I just realized something.  Silver nipple ring.  Naked wolves in bed.  I can't really press myself up against someone's back with that on, can I?  Now that's a problem I didn't think of.  Damn.  Well, I'll figure it out.</lj-cut>"

"event","I have some free time for a change so I figure I may as well put some more thoughts down on virtual paper while I have the chance.  Undoubtedly, something else will happen to call me away or one of the many people I need to talk to will call back and let me know now's a good time to meet.  <lj-cut text=""So what's on today's menu?"">So what's on today's menu?

I am.  Seems Humans First knows who I am: by picture anyway if not be name.  I'm not happy about this.  Can you detect the understated sarcasm in print?  I'm not the only one either.  They've known who Grace is for a while now and that incident on the soccer field a while back is proof of that.  They had someone taking pictures too so not only do they have some of Grace but Madi and Trinity too.  Somehow they got one of me as well even though I wasn't there for that.  I'm thinking one of them caught sight of Grace somewhere and either I was with her or they followed her to somewhere I met her.  She's known.  We're 'suspected'.

At the very least, we're sympathizers so for that alone we're targets.  No, I'm not happy.  I'm used to being hated for one reason or another.  That's nothing knew whether it's Humans First or Fundamentalist Christians.  I am not used to having a target painted on my back which is what that photo does.  I'm usually discreet but now that doesn't matter as much if they know who to look for to begin with.  Thing is, we don't know what they're planning.  If anything.  They've had at least some of those photos since the soccer incident so this might just be old news.  Assuming that would be stupid though so all four of us are back to having escorts if we go out in public.  I've also told Madison to come live in the apartments.  They're secured and mostly unknown.  The mansion is not secure and possibly compromised, considering they knew Grace lived just up the street.  I know Madi isn't happy about it.  Too bad.  Having all four targets in one secure - hopefully safe - place, surrounded by wolves makes sense and makes it easier to guard us.  If they even know about the apartments in the first place, they'd need a small army or large amounts of explosives.  And if they're willing to go that far, almost nowhere is safe.  I won't let it get to me though.

So on to other things.  My sex life is fantastic.  Seriously fantastic.  I want to see Justice again soon and spend some time with him but even that once was nice.  Nahele is learning well and that's a lot of fun and it's turned out Seth is definitely interested in guys.  Bi or gay I don't know and didn't ask.  Yet.  I probably will.  So that's a definite check in the plus column of things that are going well.  Shame my love life is non-existent.  Yes, I make a distinction between sex and love because there's a huge distinction between them.  I care about everyone I have sex with in some way but that doesn't make it love.  Eh.  Some day maybe.

I've decided to get a nipple ring.  Yes.  A silver one.  I've been thinking about it off and on for years but never decided one way or another.  Seth has silver earrings though so we got to talking about what they feel like.  So I figured what the hell?  If I don't like it I can just not wear it.  And they can't be worse than silver plated tit clamps which... aren't exactly unpleasant in the right circumstances.

Speaking of unpleasant, I need to get off my ass and meet with Kai.  This isn't anything about being vargamor at this point; no, it's about David threatening to shoot him if he has sex with Grace.  It's about his expectations and attitude.  He is not pack yet he showed up expecting to be treated like a long lost friend and brought into the fold.  I'm more inclined to kick his ass out of here.  But he's Nahele's brother and Grace's lover so for their sakes, we're giving him a chance.  But he's the one who has to compromise, not us.  He wants us; we don't want him.  So he better work at convincing us he's worth our time.  Simple, isn't it?

I'm looking forward to maybe getting a new wolf in the pack soon.  Faith is asking all the right questions and she's been offered to be infected in the past.  She seems to really be considering it now and why not?  Being therian is a great thing and something I wouldn't change ever. (Though the age and circumstance of my infection left a lot to be desired.)  Zane's agreed not to kill me if I do.  Or if Grace does or whoever actually does it.  Considering he not only knew but agreed she could be infected if she was mortally injured, this is the logical next step.  And hell, Faith is practically one of the pack already in some ways.  She certainly knows more about being a wolf than most pups do and even some new adult wolves who can only control their shifting but haven't really figured out what being a wolf means yet.

Speaking of Bo, I need to spend some time with that boy.  I barely know him but I just learned how totally unaware he is of what he really is.  He still has all the mistaken ideas of a newly infected pup.  I don't know what the hell the pack was thinking when they let this happen.  But from what I heard of the pack back then, I'm not terribly surprised.  I'm just going to have to treat him like a pup in some ways and teach him just what he is now.  And more importantly, what he isn't.

Ah, what timing.  There's Seth now.  We're going to head over to the place that did Meri's tattoo.  This should be... interesting.</lj-cut>"

"event","I need to update this more often if only to organize my thoughts and remind myself of things I want to do.  It's been over two weeks since I last did but it feels like a lot longer what with everything that's been happening.

<lj-cut text=""Where to begin?"">I'll start with the latest stuff and work back I guess.  David is doing very well and I'm very happy for him.  He's starting to really become comfortable with who he is finally.  He's worked hard to do so and it's paying off.  To quote him, he's happier than he has been in a long time.  That's really great to hear.

Grace broke up with Keahi.  Definite mixed feelings there.  On the one hand, I'm sorry for her since I know how upset she is.  On the other, let's face it: Keahi is really not my favorite person for a number of reasons.  Grace can do much better and deserves it.  I don't know how the whole animal servant thing is going to work but I only hope it doesn't become a problem.  She's been through enough.

Speaking of vampires, I fed Hariel again.  I hadn't planned to.  I met him and Merideth at the mansion only to keep her from shooting him.  I told her that I'd be standing in front of him so if she was going to be shooting anyone, it was going to be me.  To a very large degree, what happened was my fault and he stuck to the terms I set forth.  Granted, they were stretched but they weren't broken.  So no way was I going to let a wolf punish him for something I said he wouldn't be punished for.  Zane could have stopped me of course but I kind of forgot to tell him what I had planned.

Anyway, Meri just fired into the ground at his feet and that was that.  She'd said previously she lost any real desire to shoot him but I had to be sure, especially as she was being... prompted?  Permitted? by Keahi.  Once she took off, Hariel and I got to talking.  It's been a while since I saw him and I don't count when we went out there to question him about Trinity.  The subject of feeding came up and how he'd need to head to the Caress tonight.  It just seemed stupid to force him to go find someone at the Caress when I'd already fed him once before.  I like him and I trust him else I'd never have let any of my pups near him.

Plus I was curious what it would be like without being rolled.  So he did.  It hurt and felt good all at once and even more important, I was aware in a way I wasn't when rolled.  I held him this time as much as he held me.  Before, everything was lost in the feeling of him feeding.  This time, it was an entire package.  His mouth, his arms, his chest... Much, much better.  What a shame he's sexually monogamous with Faith.  It would have been even more much, much better.  (And it's kind of amusing to see him drunk on my blood too.)

Justice is back in town!  It's good to see him.  He called and I invited him over and we got reunited in the very best way possible.  I didn't /mean/ to leave as many teeth marks as I did but he didn't seem to mind at all while it was happening.  Hopefully, he'll stick around a little longer than last time so we can spend more time together.  His leaving town sooner than later is a given.

Aubrey's back, safe and hopefully sound.  Though I'm waiting for her to collapse and have hysterics or react in some other way.  Kidnapped and tortured for a week, she's earned the right.  Would it be a good or bad idea to hook her and Grace up together as some kind of support group?  Kidnapped and tortured by vampires anonymous.  Hell, they were even both made to shift and then flayed alive.  It felt so good to help kill that bitch.  I'm a little sorry she died so quickly and easily.  On the other hand, we'd be no better than the vampires if we tortured or crucified someone.

I'm acting as Nahele's Eros now.  Yum.  Not that he really needed an Eros since he's definitely into women and Madison is Eranthe.  But before the last full moon we'd sort of talked about it jokingly.  He eventually decided a little bit of experimentation wouldn't be a bad thing.  I made certain he knew he had the option of saying no at any time and this was /not/ about me being his Freki.  Convinced he understood that, well... I certainly wasn't about to say no to an attractive guy who I like wanting to have sex.  I was good though.  I didn't forget there was an actual point to it all beyond sex.  In truth, it was incredibly fun.  Pausing periodically every time he got a little too excited so he could work at controlling his wolf really prolonged the experience so that the end result was a blast.  Literally.  He seemed to enjoy it just as much so now it's a regular thing.  I'd say that was a very successful experiment for everyone involved.

Enough for now.  Those are the highlights that I can think of right now.  I can always add more later but now I need to make a key lime cheesecake for Grace.  It's her favorite and I promised I'd make her one.  Eating cheesecake is always a good idea for post-breakup depression.</lj-cut>"

Cook at the Limerick at whatever times I'm scheduled in for, meet with catering clients when convenient for them, deal with pack stuff in between and after the above.  Maybe that's not an actual routine since the times everything happens are constantly different but each day is more or less the same taken as a whole.  I can't decide if that's good or not.  <lj-cut text=""More."">

On the one hand, it does kind of mean that nothing has that emergency 'Oh my God this must be taken care of NOW!' status.  That's a good thing: a very good thing.  It means that we're actually getting a handle on things.  We're putting out the fires and not starting any new ones.

That gives people time to start acting normal again.  'Normal again' includes pairing up with the romantic interest of their choice.  Except me.  There's no compatible wolf for me.  And I've been so busy lately I don't know if there's even a compatible cat, rat, hyena, or whatever therian for me.  Hell, the one I could at least call up for a fun evening was just murdered.

Slowly, the fires are being put out and wonder of wonders, no new ones are springing up to replace them.  The apartments are ready for occupation and I've moved in now.  I'm really liking it; I love being in the heart of a city instead of out on the fringes where there's forest and ocean.  I'm comfortable going to sleep to the sounds traffic and sirens not wind and waves.  And even better, I can walk to the grocer's and to clubs.  The only thing missing are subways that take you almost anywhere you want to go.

Even the pack structure is starting to come together.  Right after I became Freki, Merideth stepped up for Geri and Jared for Skoll.  So now we have all the top spots filled (even if a couple are likely to be challenged) to provide some much needed stability.  This is a very good thing.

And speaking of Jared, we had a great time the other night.  Dinner was a huge success, breakfast was just as good and the time in between the two was even better.    Definitely need to do that again sometime.  Soon."

It was Chicago that really decided me.  I did pretty good even if I do say so myself.  I was thinking about a position before that, maybe Geri, but after... It was a simple decision.  If I thought someone else could do a better job I'd have no problem with letting them.  But I don't.  So I put my money where my mouth is.

Also, the pack needs a Freki.  And Zane needs a Freki. And the pack needs an Ulfric that isn't forced to do it all by himself.  An easy decision really.  The good of the pack comes first.

He was still there when I went back and I sat down next to him.  Told him I was being unfair and we needed to get to know each other before we ended up fighting side by side.  I sat back against him, he took his shirt off, put his arm around me, and we talked a while.  I got to know the feel of him and the scent of him.  He's pack now whether I like it or not and I really don't have any reasons fair to him to not like it.  It was just the right thing to do.

I've been very busy lately.  If it's not one thing, it's another.  And worse, I've been volunteering for it all.  There's no way in hell Zane can possibly do everything that needs doing.  There's just too many problems for him to do that. Too many fires to put out, too many other hot spots to make sure don't ignite.  The pack is just too screwed up.  I think I actually see a light at the end of the tunnel though.  Course, the way things are going, it's probably an oncoming train.

And like I already said, I can't just sit back and watch.  It's my pack that was falling apart.  Now it's my pack that's slowly, painfully, coming together.  And not only is it good to see, but it feels good to have a part in it.  Hell, I think I'm even starting to like Zane.  I might not agree with all his decisions but his priorities are right: the good of the pack comes first.  You can't argue with that.  My only question is do I step back up and take an official position in the pack again?  And if so, which?  I don't know.

I do know though that I am SO moving out of the house.  The whole area is too open, too well known.  If anyone wants to kill one of us they know where we are.  It's time to move where everyone and their fourth cousin twice removed doesn't know where to find us.  Grace, David, Meri and Madi.  Kellan, Kelsey.  As many as I can convince and, after this, how hard can it be?  I'll just point to the rug in my living room.  It's totally ruined.

There are no lifeboats on this ship.  We barely have any life vests.  If I did nothing it would be my fault for not pointing out the iceberg.  And I am so going to stop with this stupid metaphor.

But like it or not, he's Ulfric now.  I can either leave the city, challenge my way up to declaring myself Fenrir and then try to kill him (A really dumb option now since I could have challenged him to the death once already but chose not to) or obey him.

"event","We have an Ulfric.  Hoo-fucking-ray.  I don't like him and I really don't trust him.  There's no Geri, no Freki.  No Bolverk, no Skoll and I'm not sure if there's even a Hati.  Silver left the pack, Stephano and Lucas both moved away (though not because of this).  But we have an Ulfric and Lupa both of whom have been here all of three weeks.  Throw a fucking parade.  Silver should have just taken the damn position once Nicolas and Alyssa were declared dead and that would have been that.

So what did he do almost first thing?  Let Trinity test for adult status.  What the fuck?  This is the girl who has fought us every step of the way for almost three months.  Great, she's been making progress the last couple weeks; once she got sent away from the pack entirely in order to get therapy.  With a vampire and human.  Maybe eventually she'll make a decent wolf.  That doesn't make her ready for testing.  Moronic.

Returning to New York is looking better all the time.  I'll wait and see what happens but I'm going to call home and make sure I'm still welcome.  Maybe see if he'd welcome others in as well if I vouch for them.  Just in case anyone else is thinking of leaving.

It sucks that the person I'd most want to come with me can't.  But maybe it won't come to that.  Wait and see."

"event","Lots and lots of headaches.  If I ever thought I wanted to be Ulfric, this has convinced me that deciding it was a really bad idea was a really good idea.  And whoever actually does want to take it?  Should be shot and put out of their misery for surely something is seriously wrong with them.  <lj-cut text=""So what else can go wrong?"">

Our 'friend' in Chicago wants to pay a visit and offer his condolences in person.  We must be strong together in this time of sorrow, blah blah blah.  Oh, and while I'm here, I'll take you over.  I don't think so.  I did up a very polite letter in return saying basically 'thanks for thinking of us, stay the hell away' for Silver to send back.  Here's hoping he listens.  I doubt it.

At the same time, we got attacked by another pack from Toronto.  Part of a pack, to be accurate.  Seems someone told the Toronto cops we were raping and torturing pups and they told the pack up there and they decided to send some people down to kidnap Kelsey and 'save' him.  Actually, correction: we were giving pups to the vampires to rape and torture.  Of course, they were played for fools.  Now I wonder who could get their hands on real police photos of actual cases and send them to some other cops while pointing at us.  Coincidence?  I think not.

During the attack they killed one of the vampires who was guarding the mansion so one of the alphas took the blame for it on himself.  He was given to Keahi since it was a vampire who was killed.  Yes, they were manipulated.  Yes, the one alpha - Peter - had some horrible things happen to him when he was a pup himself.  That's how they pushed his buttons and I feel sorry for him for going through it.  It's horrendous.  But it doesn't excuse rushing in, attacking us, and murdering someone.  It also doesn't excuse not saying a simple 'Gee, I'm sorry we fucked up.' Maybe it's just me but I sort of expect that kind of thing.  

And then there's Zane, a new alpha in town.  Nice enough guy I suppose but he needs to learn to get to the point.  I suppose it's something about being a shrink; they want to lead you to your own conclusions or something and do the whole Socratic crap.  I'm not sure how well he'll work as an Ulfric if he just can't say what he means or wants.  I think it's between him and Silver and after last night, I'm not sure who would be the better choice.

And speaking of last night, David was throwing ideas around about defending the pack and Keahi was there.  David, on his own authority, asked Keahi if he could use a room in the sanctuary to meet with everyone.  It was so not his place to do that and I told him so the next day.  And then Keahi went on about how 'I thought the wolves didn't want help?'  Again, maybe it's just me but you help your friends without needing to be asked (which we weren't going to anyway since we didn't need help and David had no authority to do so in the first place).  So obviously we, as groups, aren't friends.  If it's all about politics, then I'm obviously not cut out for the Ulfric thing.  It just pisses me off.

"event","I seriously love the full moon.  It's not only that having all the wolves gathered together reinforces the pack bonds and that strengthens us all but I also just enjoy being a wolf.  I need to shift more often and go hunting during the rest of the month just to enjoy myself.  If I can find the time, that is.

Anyway, the pups passed their test which doesn't surprise me at all.  I knew they had it in them even though Merideth being included last minute was a surprise.  Also unsurprisingly, no one challenged Silver or me for the positions of Freki or Geri though a few people did step up for other spots.  Grace will be Bolverk (and I can't imagine anyone else wanting that) while Kellan stepped up to claim Skoll in response to Deveau's claim to Hati.  Course, Deveau was still a pup at the time so he couldn't get it but I expect that will change soon.  It's great to see the brainwashing that 'safe house' did to him isn't lasting and he's really starting to get in touch with who he really is.  Now with Merideth being an adult, Kellan's going to have a fight for Skoll I think especially since she seems to be an alpha as well.  That's not terribly surprising though personality doesn't have to go hand in hand with raw power.  

I finally remembered to tell Lucas I spoke to Gabriel about him working at the Caress and he seemed okay with the idea.  He can get some money now that the clinic is being closed and maybe take up one of the pack's houses with a few people soon.  I know he wants to be out of the mansion (who doesn't once they've been stuck there as a pup?) so I invited him to stay at the house for a while.  He's a nice guy and we all like him.  Kind of cute too in a gawky way.  He'd look good with some muscle on him.  I wonder if he'd like to work out any?

Now that the full moon is over, I want to get thinking about strengthening relations with the other groups in the city, especially the hyenas.  Not that they can really do much for us but it's just the right thing to do.  I got the full story from Grace about their role in the war and just why some people have a problem with them and I call bullshit.  They didn't have a choice.  I've felt what it's like to be Called and blaming them for what they did is such utter garbage especially when some of the vampires who actually participated have been ""forgiven"".  You don't blame the slaves for what their master did and you especially don't blame the slaves' relatives.  

Anyway, strong relations is a good thing with all the groups, not just them.  Something to think about.

"event","Alyssa and Nicolas' plane went down in the Atlantic.  No survivors have been found yet.  By now, it's probably unlikely any will be.  I had some hope knowing how hard we are to kill but after all this time... Lacking an Ulfric and Lupa is not a good state of affairs so the alphas got together to decide matters.  Jaime decided to step down as Freki.  Seeing as he's going for a PHD, I can sure understand why.

Silver is becoming Freki.  I can live with that.  It's not that I wanted the position but instead I wasn't sure if he could be trusted with his ties to the Master of the City.  Talk about a conflict of interest.  I asked a few questions though and am - somewhat - reassured that even if he became Ulfric the pack wouldn't end up the pet poodles or trained attack dogs of the vampires.  I'd challenge him before I let that happen.

I'm taking the Geri spot like I originally wanted to.  When I first heard of this, I thought about if I wanted to be Ulfric.  I'd take it if I had to.  I'd challenge for it if I couldn't trust Silver to do what's best for the pack.  But when you get right down to it, I don't want it.  Besides, are the Lukoi ready for a male Lupa?

I think this is the best situation we can manage right now.  And not this full moon but the next we'll see about an Ulfric.  If there are no contenders that we feel we can live with, either Silver or me will be forced to take it.  There's still hope they'll be rescued but...

"event","I'm changing in ways I never expected.  I can see why, and how, but it's something I never expected.  It's something I never would have expected before now.  That's part of the change.

Back in New York, I was 'the kid'.  I was the one they needed to teach and protect and take care off even more than your average pup cause I was fourteen when I was first infected.  Even when I got older, a lot of them still saw me that way and to a degree, I saw myself that way.  That's one reason I was so ready to go off to college out of state.  I wanted to stop being 'the kid' and just be myself.

It worked.  I wasn't 'the kid' in Seattle.  They took me for who I was. In fact, they didn't really trust me at first.  The Ulfric there wasn't the trusting type.  Very cold.  Paranoid almost.  If he wasn't also fair I'd have hated his guts.  Not that it would have mattered.  The important part though was that in Seattle, I was there to go to college.  It was always in the back of my mind that I wouldn't be staying.  I was part of the pack but it wasn't really /my/ pack.  I was just passing through.

Here, it's different.  Here, it's my pack.  This is where I'm staying.  This is my city.  These are the wolves I'm going to be with for a long time.  These are the wolves I need to protect.  I've always been very pack oriented but this is different.  I'm not the kid here and I'm not the visitor.  I changed when I got here and I've changed since then too.

I'm someone who decided to challenge for the position of Geri when the position opened because I looked around at all the other dominant wolves and decided I'd do a better job at it.  I'm someone who can force a wolf to shift against his will if I need to when I never realized I could do such a thing before.  I'm someone who can calmly let someone suffer from punishment because they earned it and it will teach them an important lesson.

I'm stronger, physically and mentally.  More confidant in body and mind.  I like who I'm becoming.  And I'm going to bake a strawberry cheesecake to treat myself."

"event","Sometimes I think I should start these entries with 'Dear diary' or something.  I actually tried that earlier and backspaced it out.  I'm not a thirteen year old girl.  And this isn't a diary anyway.  It's a way of organizing my thoughts and reminding myself to do things that are important.  And I'll swear to that in court.

<lj-cut text=""Organized thoughts under the cut"">
I'm very disappointed in Kelsey.  At first, I was furious but I've since calmed down.  What a stupid, stupid thing he did.  It's not just that he screwed up; everyone makes mistakes.  But he made a choice to disobey.  And then he had the nerve to say he didn't regret it.  And just as bad - in an entirely different way - had he just waited eight days he'd have been able to screw whoever he wanted.  But no.  He showed a complete lack of self control and not much common sense either.  I just can't recommend that he be allowed to test for adult status.  There's more to being an adult wolf than controlling your shifting and he clearly demonstrated he can't be trusted to act responsibly or smartly.  Eight fucking days.  Well, Jaime punished him and then he went to the Pard to be punished as well since Griffin was involved.  He's made his bed and now he needs to lie in it.

Speaking of lying in bed... Things are going very nicely with Kellan.  Much nicer than I ever expected.  Who knew a little innocent flirting with a hot 'straight' guy would actually get me anywhere?  Damn.  All the opportunities I missed over the years.  He's decided he's definitely attracted and wants to follow though on his feelings.  Who am I to say no?  Especially when I think he's very hot and I like him on top of it.  We're going to have a lot of fun.

What wasn't fun was having Alyssa cut me open and remove all that scar tissue on my shoulder.  Now I know why I never had it done before.  I might be a big, bad werewolf but letting someone slice me up with a scalpel - and without anesthetic - hurts!  The things we do for vanity.  But it's gone now and looks fine.  Though vanity wasn't the only reason.  That shoulder was just a bit tight because of some muscle damage and if I'm going to challenge for Geri, I want to be in perfect form.  All else being equal, it could have made a difference.  Now I don't need to worry about it.

Some of the pack went off to play soccer and ran into some of those Human First bigots.  They got into a fight and several got hurt to one degree or another.  I'm sorry I wasn't there to help but on the other hand, it might have been a very good thing I wasn't.  I'm pretty damn good at controlling myself but prejudice really pushes my buttons.  Maybe cause I get it from two sides and have even run into it from other wolves who had a thing against gays.  It's always amazed me in a 'what the fuck?' kind of way how targets of prejudice can be just as bigoted toward others.  

Feh.  Even typing about it pisses me off so I'll stop.  I'll think about Kellan instead.  Happy thoughts.  And Stephano.  Very happy thoughts.  Yes, that's much better.</lj-cut>"

"event","There's a new wolf in town.  Though technically, he's not new and he's barely a wolf despite having been infected for a year or so.  He was in one of those ""safe houses"" and his sister - a lawyer - finally got him out.

<lj-cut text=""So what happened?"">
A couple of us ran into him and to say he was clueless about how things work is the understatement of the year.  I don't know for certain what they do to shifters in those places but from what I've seen of this guy - David Deveau is his name - they teach them to be good little humans and totally deny their nature.  It reminds me of how those ""ex-gay"" groups try to get people to be happy little heterosexuals by just pretending they aren't <b>really</b> gay, oh no! and instead convince them if they just try hard enough they too can ignore those evil impulses for the sake of happy, <i>normal</i> biblical marriage.  Makes me want throat someone.

Anyway, we convinced him that yes, he really does need to join the pack if he doesn't want to be run out of town or killed and to come meet the Ulfric.  Who didn't have time to see him so he stayed over night.  He's not a prisoner but he knows his options are limited.  Anyway, a few of us were around the next day and he showed up.  One thing led to another, discussion of wolf behavior, and wolf nature - our nature - and he started to freak.  See, good little humans aren't supposed to give in to their bad, monstrous therian nature so he's been completely locking himself down.  Grace and I, and a few of the pups, were trying to get him to relax and just loosen up and enjoy the feeling of pack.  To get in touch with his four legged and furry side.

You'd think we suggested he have an afternoon snack of babies.  'It's not allowed!' he shouted.  'It's dangerous!'  Not allowed?  That really pissed me off, how they brainwashed him.  So I shifted just to drive home how it is allowed and then he really freaked out.  At that point I became convinced he need to shift and needed to shift now.  He had to break their damn rule.  I bet he never went furry except during the full moon.  Grace seemed to agree and we stopped trying to soothe his beast.  Hell, it was trying to break free on its own but he was fighting it.

So I helped.  I didn't know I could help.  Usually you're helping someone stay in control and <b>not</b> shift.  I don't think I ever wanted someone to change against his will.  So when I managed to draw forth his beast and make him shift into his wolf form, I was as surprised as Grace was if not more.

Huh.

"event","Has it only been a month since I got here?  That sounds incredible considering how much has happened and how many ties developed so quickly.  It feels like I've been here so much longer...

<lj-cut text=""Long rambling ahead."">
I just started working at the pub the Lupa owns as a part time cook.  I'm way overqualified for it but the situation is ideal: no problems about the full moon and pack emergencies are immediately understood.  It also means I have an income now instead of having to go through the whole job hunting thing.  It's enough while I get my own catering business off the ground.  I'm going to try to target the gay community specifically (though not limit myself just to them) by advertising in all the local gay papers and websites.  One thing about the queer community, they're loyal consumers so long as the product is good.

The kitchen in the house is slowly turning into exactly what I need for the catering with two large ovens, increased stove space and extra large fridge and freezer for supplies.  Kellan has made it incredibly easy, giving me a free hand to make whatever changes I want to the kitchen.  It's surprising how comfortable and at home I feel in the house already.  Living with Kellan and Stephano is great and having all the pups coming and going or staying just makes it that much better.  I love having pack around and such handsome pack is a bonus, especially when sex is available too.

Not that my relationship with Stephano is purely about sex though that's a pretty incredible part of it.  There's definitely more going on and we're beginning to explore that.  Fortunately, neither of us is monogamous by nature (how could he be when he wants to be Eros) so that doesn't leave Kellan out of the picture.  I don't even know what's going to happen with him.  He's just discovering he can go both ways and if it weren't for his human girlfriend I'd have shown him just how many ways he's capable of.  It was damn hard (and so was I) stopping short like that but when he said he felt he couldn't because of her I had to honor it.  He's my pack mate and I won't cause him difficulty.

Kelsey's also staying with us since I'm his sponsor.  He's a great kid.  I haven't had a little brother since James died in the attack that infected me.  He's a bit over emotional and needy but who wouldn't be after what happened to him?  I'm trying to wean him out of it enough so he'll be comfortable standing on his own.  It'll always be part of his nature though.  Will... It was brilliant to suggest Madison sponsor him.  Fucking brilliant.  When he started to react protectively to her the idea just flashed into my mind.  By protecting Madison, his wolf instincts will become stronger and help him adapt to being a member of the pack.  And by teaching him... Well, maybe she'll become stronger in turn once she realizes she's responsible for him.

It's a good pack.  Though there are some stronger ties to vampires than I've run into before with my last two.  I know why now my last pack didn't much like vampires and my first one kept me away from them when I was a kid.  Honestly?  They scare the shit out of me.  Lee's power is incredible.  I wanted to go lie at her feet and she wasn't even trying.  I could resist but I had to actively resist the urge.  I don't know if I could if she were actually trying to call me.  I hope so but I wouldn't bet on it.  And I don't like that.  It's not just that though.  They're capable of the most horrific forms of calculated torture I've ever seen.  And they accept it like it's no big deal.  They might not like it but they accept it.

Look, I know punishment is required at times.  Even extreme punishment.  But crucifying someone?  On silver spikes and displaying him for everyone to see?  And not just that but to offer him up like a banquet to anyone who wants a taste?  I'd kill someone before I humiliate and degrade them like that.  I'm a simple wolf and such... exotic measure don't sit right with me.  It's only when I learned that one of them - Gabriel - took him down on his own authority that I remembered how much I hate being lumped in with my entire group and judged.  There are vampires I can like and ones I'd tear the throat out of if they looked at me wrong.  In other words, they're just like everyone else.  But I really, really hate their 'culture'.  And I could never accept it the way they seem to.  Then again, what choice do they really have?  Poor fuckers.

Well, more later maybe.  I need to shower and get to work or Molly will hit me over the head with her mixing spoon for being late.  She's so cute that way.</lj-cut>"

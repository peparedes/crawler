Why does me showing interest in you make me less attractive, men? And sometimes i think it's the same both ways, but i swear it's always the guys i DON'T LIKE that show interest.. or maybe i don't like them BECAUSE they show interest? naw, that can't be it. I'm thinking of a four letter word... why won't he just fucking call me, eh? oh he'll probably text me by the end of the week, but come on. How is it less awkward to fuck someone than to conversate with them? And how come i only question MYSELF when it comes to dudes?"

"event","nah. just feeling nostalgic. or not. i don't know. i feel like all of this, the myspacing and the livejournaling, is such a huge cry for help. my sister will post bulletins on meatspace saying ""im so sad, love me."" i don't even want to write this because i really lack the motivation. my stupid fucking boyfriend left in a huff this morning. i told him i don't want him on my computer last night because there are certain things in my search engines i just wouldn't want him to see, because he judges me.

so i tell him to get off my computer (he's already started looking through my bookmarks) and he freaks out, assuming i'm hiding ""pictures"" or ""a list of guys you've fucked"". is it so ridiculous to think that maybe i have things in my life i'd rather not broadcast that DON'T show what a gigantic slut i am? 

he's so insecure that he always thinks i'm cheating on him. he doesn't believe a word that comes out of my mouth and is always insinuating and making me feel small. small and stupid. like a fucking infant. asking me loaded questions that would make even the thick skinned uncomfortable.

the fact is: in the (nearly) 6 months we've been together, despite one week of us being broken up and one week of him in ""england""  i've never fucked anyone else. in the 6 months (almost) we've been going out. i kissed two other boys. something i'm not necessarilly proud of, but not ashamed either. i needed to see if i ""felt"" anything when i kissed someone else, but i didn't.

maybe it's because i've been kissing the wrong boy all along. it really feels so ridiculously terrible to feel such longing for someone, and feel like you're only barely connected to them by a thin string of memory. wondering if he thinks about me, trying to get myself to stop thinking about him. distracting myself. we only dated for about 5 months, and i just dreamed of him for the rest of it. and fought for him. and gave to him. and thought of him. and what did he give to me? i'm still waiting to find out. still waiting to see if he'll give me anything besides this longing and sick feeling in the pit of my stomach whenever i lie next to someone else and think ""what the fuck am i doing?"""

"event","on hotornot.com.... this man wants me:

I love to be ordered around and dominated by a woman. I am very much into complete servitude, unconditional surrender, forced foot & shoe worship, extreme humiliation and degradation. I crave to be used as a slave/servant/doormat. 



Hahahahahaha. That's amazing. He sent me an email:



Hello Miss...

You matched me... Does that mean that you are interested in having me
crawling on the ground by your feet, licking clean the bottoms of your
shoes?

Sincerely,

Adam


Thats amazing. N E way... woke up yesterday, hung around the house, got picked up by nick and his mamadukes around 4:45 ish... went to Lillian's house, got picked up by sara(h)(?) diamond and the mask. made crack jokes all the way there (the mask had spread rumors after i got expelled from beverly that i had been kicked out for selling crack) went to westwood to do hookah, lillian and nick are doing a story on it for the school newspaper. got in and out (do you know their starting salary is nine bucks and hour? plus lots of other fun benefit thingies. wowee.) went to the hookah place on pico but it was closed (for shabbat?) walked to la cianega (how the fuck do you spell it?) park. met up w/ lila and jennie. sat around and talked at a picinic table foreva. went and played on the playground. a certain someone who i will not mention met us there. lilian (and all those other fine people)'s friends charlie and aaron met us. we stood around for a long time talking about balls and if which side your penis hangs to has anything to do with whether you're right or left handed, lillian told us she loves her poon, etc. we then went to canters. i had like, a dollar fifty in change so lillian lent us 2 bucks and me and somoene shared mstzo ball soup. we went into the parking lot and there were these guys in their mid twenties selling t shirts from their car. they asked us to show them our titties, so nick (sally) did. and then i gave them a preview, and we were about to go to the car, but we somehow arranged that if i showed them my boobs full on, they'd give me a t shirt. i was a little hesitant, but then i fell badck into my old flasher ways and did it (how spring break of me) lillian hates me now because i prositute myself for shirts. then we dropped off jennie, went to lilsy's house for a which and looked at stephanie hammer's ""while we change"" catalogue which has bathing suits that make you ten pounds slimmer in ten seconds, pelvic floor strengthening exercises and a g spot ""massager"" hey, i thought women reach their sexual peak in their 40's? anyway, went back to nicks house with lila, realized i was stranded, decided to sleep over, we blizzed a lil and nick was soooo fucking gone, but i can totally empathize because thats exactly what it was like the first tme i did it after 13 months. it's scary shit. we watched manhattan, lila left, my mom got angry at me on the phone, i slept (sort of) on the couch, then the floor then the couch again, woke up at 6:26, ordered a cab to THE CORNER OF GREGORY AND CAMDEN NOTTTTT NICK'S ADDRESS but they came to his house anyway and i looked like a crazy homeless because i was wearing a sweatshirt and had this huge duffel bag. it was really early, but i told him to take me home, but on second thought, had him take me to starbucks, which was a good idea because he only had 5 dollars change (fuckin liar.) so i went in and got a mocha frapp w/ a shot and lemon loaf. tasty. i gave the idiot his change and went back inside. thee was a cop in there for i said hi and asked how he was. i walked up wilshire to the gas station, and they weren't gonna sell me stogies, but then carlos came to my rescue, because like, everyone at that gas station knows me. then we talked for a little while and he told me about his escapades the night before about him going dancing and then to his friend's house and doing a lil sumthin and then going hom getting 2 hrs of sleep, showering and coming here (to the 76 station) i am so getting  a job there. or somewhere. i just need a fucking job. anyway, walked quite slowly home, and thankfully knew the code to my garage and just went inside without waking the rents (i hope) hooray.


now...who wants to take em to disneyland?"

TrumanHW LA: Hello.
TrumanHW LA: whos number did you just give me liar?
TrumanHW LA: I knew you were full of shit.
TrumanHW LA: But I thought you'd be better at lying than this.
TrumanHW LA: who are you?
HYMyNameIsCancer: oh truman truman truman
HYMyNameIsCancer: you silly person
TrumanHW LA: back.
TrumanHW LA: I'm silly?
TrumanHW LA: I'm not really... it's pretty reasonable for a person to think there's something illegitimate about this.
TrumanHW LA: Well?
TrumanHW LA: It says you're there.
TrumanHW LA: So who are you?
HYMyNameIsCancer: i'm me
TrumanHW LA: Oh yeah?
TrumanHW LA: Then whos number did you give me?
HYMyNameIsCancer: who answered the phone?
TrumanHW LA: you tell me.
HYMyNameIsCancer: christine
TrumanHW LA: Whos that?
HYMyNameIsCancer: novelist
TrumanHW LA: ??
HYMyNameIsCancer: shes a novelist
HYMyNameIsCancer: she wrote a novel
TrumanHW LA: uh...
TrumanHW LA: Why is that on your voice mail?
TrumanHW LA: Call me right now.
HYMyNameIsCancer: no
HYMyNameIsCancer: why is what on my voice mail
TrumanHW LA: Some ones name other than yours...?
TrumanHW LA: And if I call you right now will you answer?
HYMyNameIsCancer: no
TrumanHW LA: Doesn't that seem a little abnormal?
TrumanHW LA: Hmmm... I don't usually do this... but I'm going to send you a link.
HYMyNameIsCancer: i might not click it
HYMyNameIsCancer: u can send it anyway
TrumanHW LA: Uh, for a girl whos all interested you sure do have a lot of inconsistencies. 
HYMyNameIsCancer: maybe i have multiple personality disorder...
TrumanHW LA: No, maybe your someone whos bitter. Whats your real name?
HYMyNameIsCancer: why'd i be bitter?
TrumanHW LA: Yeah, you're someone I rejected obviously. 
TrumanHW LA: http://www.iqtest.com/report.html?uid=7472756d616e687740686f746d61696c2e636f6d-330-1106029963&score=true
HYMyNameIsCancer: haha
TrumanHW LA: maybe from that you can figure out my ability to detect when things aren't as they seem.
TrumanHW LA: I think I know who this is too.
TrumanHW LA: And I think this is the second time you've done this.
HYMyNameIsCancer: haha maybe
HYMyNameIsCancer: but truman
TrumanHW LA: What?
HYMyNameIsCancer: if u were as smart as u say you are
TrumanHW LA: yeah, I know who you are now.
HYMyNameIsCancer: you would know that it's wit, not witticism
TrumanHW LA: LOL
TrumanHW LA: BITTTTTER.
TrumanHW LA: LMAO
HYMyNameIsCancer: a witticism is a witty remark
HYMyNameIsCancer: haha, u are so silly.
HYMyNameIsCancer: you don;t even have any idea who this is
TrumanHW LA: I think I do.
HYMyNameIsCancer: nah
HYMyNameIsCancer: trust me, you don't
TrumanHW LA: And secondly, if theres a typo, it's just that.
TrumanHW LA: Well, enlighten me then.
TrumanHW LA: and where did I say witticism? 
HYMyNameIsCancer: in ur profile on hotornot
TrumanHW LA: Hmmm... I just looked, and it doesnt say that.
HYMyNameIsCancer: so, if ur so hot why do you need to pick up girls on hotornot
HYMyNameIsCancer: plussssss
HYMyNameIsCancer: if u were so smart
HYMyNameIsCancer: wouldn't u check to see if i was on ur double matches and because  i wasn't wonder how i got your sn?
HYMyNameIsCancer: hmmm
HYMyNameIsCancer: seems like common sense to me
TrumanHW LA: Of course I would.
TrumanHW LA: And was trying to decypher that.
HYMyNameIsCancer: that didn't keep u from invitin me ober
TrumanHW LA: But as it turns out, I was pretty sure I knew who you were. And still am. And furthermore suspected it was the second time.
TrumanHW LA: Well, I got my answer.
TrumanHW LA: But you're the one who's suffering, not me.
TrumanHW LA: And that's obvious. 
TrumanHW LA: LOL
HYMyNameIsCancer: haha
TrumanHW LA: You are.
HYMyNameIsCancer: hats so funny
HYMyNameIsCancer: omg
HYMyNameIsCancer: i just enjoy gettibng a rise out of u
TrumanHW LA: No, it's not so funny, it's only funny in that you don't want to admit that its NOT funny because the only thing that would cause you to do this... was the very thing that caused me to stop seeing you. You're disfunctional. 
TrumanHW LA: Whatever.
HYMyNameIsCancer: and i am obviously
TrumanHW LA: I'm not risen. 
HYMyNameIsCancer: dude
TrumanHW LA: Oh, when are you paying me back by the way?
HYMyNameIsCancer: im most DEFINATELY not one of your ex girlfriends
TrumanHW LA: Oh, you're not?
HYMyNameIsCancer: no you stupid prick
HYMyNameIsCancer: I'M A GUY
TrumanHW LA: Well, which cunt are you then?
HYMyNameIsCancer: ha, you idiot
TrumanHW LA: So, who are you?
TrumanHW LA: DID I FUCK YOUR GIRLFRIEND?
TrumanHW LA: LOL
HYMyNameIsCancer: ha no
TrumanHW LA: Oh.
TrumanHW LA: :-(
HYMyNameIsCancer: i dun even know u
HYMyNameIsCancer: i just know ur a prick
TrumanHW LA: Then whats your motive?
HYMyNameIsCancer: so i enjoy fucking with you
TrumanHW LA: You must know someone I know. 
HYMyNameIsCancer: its funny to get a cocky asshole like you to get all kinky w/ some ""hot girl"" and ifnd out its just me
HYMyNameIsCancer: that's fucking ufnny
TrumanHW LA: That makes you a fag, no?
TrumanHW LA: What city do you live in?
HYMyNameIsCancer: haha
HYMyNameIsCancer: why the fuck would it matter?
TrumanHW LA: Well, maybe by some stroke of luck we'll cross paths, and I can share some of my altruism with you.
TrumanHW LA: And give you some improved facial characteristics. 
HYMyNameIsCancer: keep it to yourself, fucker
TrumanHW LA: You must be ugly.
TrumanHW LA: Are you fat?
TrumanHW LA: LOL
TrumanHW LA: Short maybe?
HYMyNameIsCancer: haha, who cares?
HYMyNameIsCancer: for someone who's so smart, you don;t know when to shut up, do you asshole?
TrumanHW LA: Well, you must. You care... because girls are probably rarely interested in, and normally they are probably ugly... right? Then they reject you, and you can't tell why. LOL
HYMyNameIsCancer: haha
TrumanHW LA: Actually, I think I should definitely continue. Seems like I'm on to something. 
HYMyNameIsCancer: you're trying to phase me, aint working
HYMyNameIsCancer: stop trying to regain your masculinity by putting me down, it's just making you look like MORE of an ignorant pustule
TrumanHW LA: Who cares, your low position on the ""attractiveness"" totem pole will certainly get the best of you in life.
TrumanHW LA: Well, if I had a bit of insecurity about it I would... but alas, lets continue. 
TrumanHW LA: Send me a picture of you fag.
HYMyNameIsCancer: no, i dont want u to beat off to me
TrumanHW LA: Lets see the guy with the time on his hands to contact me.
TrumanHW LA: And secondly, who gave you my screen name?
HYMyNameIsCancer: dude, you are such an annoying little shit
TrumanHW LA: You contacted me turd. 
HYMyNameIsCancer: yup
HYMyNameIsCancer: and now you bore me
HYMyNameIsCancer: :::yawn:::
TrumanHW LA: Then piss off fag. 
HYMyNameIsCancer: hah
HYMyNameIsCancer: ur the one who kept talking
TrumanHW LA: Well, I would like to know who did this.
TrumanHW LA: But I'm putting an end to it in either way. 
HYMyNameIsCancer: hah
HYMyNameIsCancer: ok
HYMyNameIsCancer: i'll let YOU put it to an end
HYMyNameIsCancer: oh man, you're great
TrumanHW LA: Okay, fuck off.

i love how he sent me his iq test to show me he's smart. hahaha. n e ways, i went to school today. it was career day. my anxiety was SOOOO bad, especially when i saw mr. step. but it's cool, cuz i got myself up (after nick called, haha) ready and dressed & walked to school. hung out w/ my buddies during school and said hi to sra. carter and sr. peixoto. i wanted to say hi to mr. hall but i couldn't find him. we put mr. pressman on hotornot.com hahahahaha. give him a ten. i was in madame kashper's class first period (AHHHHHHHH) and then for career day i went to novelist (christine hassler, not REALLY a novelist) w/ nick, lila, lillian, jenny and bessie (but i had a pizza bagel first, YEAHHHHHHHH) then i went to contemporary musician (cindy alexander...what else can i say) and then music production. i went to mr. stiles' room to get a copy of when i was on voices of tomorrow and apparently he didn't know that i've been gone for a year. haha. i swear, i need to go back to beverly next year as a senior. went to chipotle after skewl (there was this MEAN man there) walked to lilsy's house and we had a nice talk and i love her very much. we had so much fun at her house. i love my friends.  n e way. came home, chilled a bit. nick came over and we played this boardgame that was like, this midnight spooky party game. haha. quite entertaining. we watched  a little of the new romeo and juliet and made hemp bracelets. then we went downstairs and ate pizza and we happened to turn on lifetime (a channel for women) and the movie ""odd girl out"" was on.  i actually really wanted to see it so we watched and it was very glorious. go to lifetimetv.com on tips on how to help your daughter through middle school and highschool. we cuddled a little and then he left. we hugged for like, a whole minute. i just can't bring myself to kiss him. our relationship is so pure. it's kind of scary. going to atmosphere on wednesday....YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! (we go up to random people and are like ""YEAHHHHHH!!!"" i gues you have to be there)

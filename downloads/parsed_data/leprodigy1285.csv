"event","I have an amazing year in 2009. I met Ben DeHaan on (IN) game and we chatted. Hooked up our characters by getting married. His character was a lycan and mine was a vampire. By that time around Sept 2009. We decided to give each other a try irl and so.. He flew me to Wa State, Seattle and we met on his bday on Oct 16, 2009. Stayed there for few days and flew back home then he decided I should move in with him so I flew back there several weeks later and move in with him around after thanksgiving. So... another few months flew by, around Dec 25.. he gave me a hug around 6 in the morning while we were stocking up the socks. He said as he hugged me ""I want to grow old with you"" then he pulled out a box and inside it was the ring and ask me to marry him and I said ""Yes!"" So now we've been engaged for over a year and the wedding date is set to July 4, 2011. He put on the 1k gold of diamond in my right hand first cause we both were so freaking tired then I told him ""Shouldn't it be in the left hand?"" (Lol)... It's so big!.. had to resize it from 5 ro 4 1/2 ring size. XD.. It's been a really long time since I've been here.. I miss you guys. My uncle Mike the one who raised me in from my 8th grade through graduating in May 2004. Is diagnosed with Stage 3 Lung cancer and they said he's got barely 2 weeks to live. It's incurable and the only thing they can help him is ease the pain till he passes away in the Hospital. I prayed alot and kept asking that he would still make it. But it wasn't exactly my prayers but he was asking for me to come to NC, Fayetteville and I'll be flying sometime this weekend there. I've not seen him in over 5 years! I heard he lost alot of weight.. imagine a 57 yr old man, around 6'1-6'3 weighing about 90lbs.. he's so skinny..! And he finally started eating last week, first time in 3 months. O.O That's a good relief that I'll be able to see him before he goes -Starts crying- then I heard today that my friend Truvey had passed away on Jan 11, 2011 at 2:45pm. He had a pneumonia, his heart, lungs and liver were failing. He was fighting it for a while and failed to mention me about it. I've known him for like over 5 years playing (BF) game with him. He always cared about that game and he would put everyone first before him. He was only 47 yrs old. T_T I had an uncle passed away last year before my bday came.. then my grandfather passed away 2 yrs ago half a year before my bday came.. then my great great aunt had died few weeks later of 2007. Now I hear another of my uncle in the Philippines is on 2 oxygen tanks.. It's hard to face the reality of death in your family. I am trying to hold on. Trying to keep it positive that we'll soon all meet them."

"event","His name is Louis Pacini, we've known each other for more than a year now and got together on June 30th. He is coming down here finally to meet him and he will be going to move in with me and we will be getting our own place. I am a model and something more now. Porn star if you put it to that. today I got a call to get into a film with Jamie Foxx in Las Vegas to get flown there. Everything is doing great for me, Louis is going to be here by Sept 18, hopefully if everything goes as his plans. I am also getting flown out of USA somewhere to make more vids from Bang Brother's Productions. Am making one this Friday morning and my sister is my new make-up artist. She'll be my personal assistance from now on and will be working for me. Also I can't wait"

"event","My poor Mustang GT (Suboshi) got his side right view window was broken into... WAAAH! I'm sorry Schu I called you early this morning, I had to calm down a bit. And talking to you would help me calm. But anyways, I broke down crying about my baby car... And two other cars was broken into, still..... Were getting him fixed today, and it was my sister's 18th b-day today. But I got to get my Suboshi together in one piece again. I can't believe this. They do have or might have a lead on who it is. This ani't no vandalism, it was a pro stealing. My iPod was being tried to get stolen, they couldn't get it. Even though they managed to open the smallest window. Makes no sense. I told the Sheriff that the only thing missing was my car manual. He stared at us strangely. It definitely made no sense to me either. *Sighs* 2 weekends ago, I got to feed an Alligator named him Ali G Bruno... He was 4ft long, then I saw a 3 1/2 ft Greater Amberjack fish eating my premium chickens. We named him Big Boi! So, besides waking up finding this morning was a complete disaster. I would rather have not to see it this early, oh well... Hope we find the culprit!"

That's how I've been feeling these past few weeks... I don't know her much about her, it's like she trying to get me disconnected to all the friends I had in NC. She had to lie herself to the top. I know she's just trying to protect them, but their my friends too. I know it sounds selfish, but I don't want to loose them even though I know they already are in danger. Sorry to my friends out there and my best-friend. Whatever she's said, I know she even called but it wasn't me. I can tell when I know I'm sleeping and she's awake taking over. I even notice she cancelled our AZ room, but I'm gonna get us another room. Anyways, don't worry. I got a good news they have more reservations cancelled as April is coming soon. I'm going to call them tomorrow. I'll let you know here in LJ what's up. I know Loosta is a bit too much to get rid of. But I can't. T_T  -.-'  I'll just have to tell her some things she can't do. This persona is getting out of control. The other night she left to see my friend, I knew she was in danger cuz I started to feel fire all over my body and came up with a high fever. I thought I was goona burn the blankets and die in a cause of a body heat stroke, but my bf got in time to help me give some pills. I'm feeling a little better, headaches just getting worst and I'd rather have that than that high fever feeling. Great! I'm loosing my voice too. *sighs* I'm gonna kill that Loosta when she comes back!"

"event","You scored a total of 52 


Based upon your responses to this bipolar disorder quiz, you appear to be suffering from moderate to severe symptoms associated with a bipolar disorder. People who have answered similarly to you typically qualify for a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder and have sought professional treatment for this disorder. (You may, however, still fit into the less serious diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder.) 

You should not take this as a diagnosis of any sort, or a recommendation for treatment. However, if would be advisable and likely beneficial for you to seek further diagnosis from a trained mental health professional soon to rule out a possible depressive disorder.
 

It does make sense when I get moody for no apparent reasons and would act so lethargic in less than a second over a quick period of time.
It's so funny, I got to see all my side effects the fact that I've got a Mixed bipolar depressant. It's so severe that I've been like this for my whole entire life, and now I gotta go get to a doctor. Maybe then, I'll feel better. But ofcourse my grandpa knew what I had to go through cuz of my parents abandoning me, had to leave my hometown island the Philippines at age ten while everyone was pretending to get all dressed up and then my aunt waving goodbye and saying be a good girl, I never get to meet my biological father in the Philippines (I only got his presents, I'm thinking my mom didn't want me to meet him for many stupid reasons just like my all my family members felt the same way as her), I lost my step-father, my mom is going through some bad times with her boyfriend, my mom's parents are dying, my uncle is dying of a cancer in his leg in Philippines, my uncle in North Carolina Fayettenam is dying from a lung cancer, my boyfriend keeps drinking & already had 2 seizures last year, my mom needs medical attention on her right eye (lookd like a crocodile eye) and she needs to get a surgery on both of her hands, my sister needs to see a doctor also cuz were all thinking she's get bigger and bigger everyday she might have trouble with her tyroid or sumtin, my family is falling apart, my ex bf keeps calling me a Cuntzhen (he changed the Katz part from schen into cunt) on e-mail notes he send me, I'm getting more and more severely stress out I just wanna go kill myself but I don't want anyone to make them sad; so I have to keep living, my best-friend Schu is being tortured by her father's restricted rules, everything is stressing me out, I don't feel like I can ever be happy no matter how people look at me and would say ""you look so happy when......."" I never will be. Not with a past I have to bear and with all the loneliness and abandons I had to go through at a young age. How much can you all compare to my past childhood life? None right? You all had parents. Atleast you got to be with your parents and living a happy life with your own family. I didn't have that. I'm dying to meet my father so badly, it hurts me that my own blood would keep me away from him, yet them not knowing how much I don't care if he was this and that; he is my father after all."

And my Puppy wonders why I haven't being trying to be nice to him. When Kenneth is the one who is attacking me verbally online. I told Schu all about this and Puppy seems to know what Schu meant on her e-mail notes. I'm also having to go on a treatment right now, got an cervix cancer. Doc said, if all goes worst... He's going to inject me. I told him ""I would rather get injected now, so I don't have to feel anymore pain during sex!"" *clears throat* BTW, I don't want to loose my Suboshi either!

So, I was flying the Ragnarok (from FF VIII) and Cid wanted to teach me to fly it. Melissa and Balthier (from FF XII) was taking and their conversation was. Melissa said with a straight face, ""So, I hear that you never miss?..."" Balthier was somehow a little amused when she question his sayings. He responded, ""M'lady, ofcourse I never miss. Would you inquire that in bed or not?"" Melissa's face went so red that Mateus (the esper from FF XII) notice and made fun of her. She look at him with rage and right before he realized she was behind him. And then... *RIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPP* She said, ""Oh lookie lookie! What do we have for our bare naked skin breast showing in front of everyone"". Belias was laughing and said, ""Awws, are you embarrassed about ur male chest breast to us?"" Melissa got mad and Banished Belias and said to everyone including Belias before he was banished, ""I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO SAY THINGS TO HIM LIKE THAT! AM I CLEAR?"" *We all started to cast Protect and Regens on ourselves and flees* Then Belias was gone and Melissa was looking furious. *Mateus was so never been humiliated in his life and teleport away for 3 days* Melissa laugh ever so evilly and we were all just standing there. Next thing she new, a small toy figure came from down and Vincent said, ""So, ur replacing me now with Balthier?"" Melissa looks down and saw the cute little 7 inch tall Vincent in his demon form. ""Vincent???!, nani??"" Melissa looks all confused.  Balthier looks at Vincent when he notice he step on his tail and Vincent's tail got stuck on his shoe. He then said, ""What is that noise coming from?"" Melissa points down at his foot. Melissa posted about billions of Mateus' humiliation picture in the in everyone's home, doors everywhere she posted it. (Right now I just probly can't remember the rest, Melissa can probly post the other parts to this but last night was alot more funnier). Then our Ragnarok crashes into the desert and I kept saying ""You wanted to teach me Cid!"" and we were going towards the worm hole under the sand dunes. Melissa summoned Mateus and his clothing was still in the hands of his master's (meaning Melissa), we just died laughing our ass off!!! Mateus had no choice to follow Melissa's command to help the Ragnarok from getting suck into the worm hole sands. So there it was, Balthier's ass was slapped by Melissa's persona (Only she can see her shadow) and Melissa just flipped out and said ""Thousand years of pain!!!!!"" *poor Balthier, it was actually 999,999 years of pain needles* Then she erased his memory and told all of us who saw it and said, ""Those who tells him what actually happens are gonna get this thousand years of pain too or worst..."" *We saw it so clearly in her eyes, glowing in a red gazed with pierce eyes ready toi haunt us all* We all nodded our head. Some of us had put Silence magic on our Gambit (Those who played FF XII knows what I'm talking about gambit, and I'm just leveling up on my game. OH sorry! Story...) She made it clear and we all understood. She faked to be a nurse and that he was a wounded soldier and she took out all the needles of his butt. Her eyes was just so amazed at his nice, round ass like Balthier's ass. He woke up and said, ""What is this on my shoe?, is that a tail?"" Melissa took Vincent's tail and she was like, ""Oh that's my friend's tail, his tail is so hyper and cuts right off from his booty all the time. Eh... hehehehe..."" *She teleports it back to the rightfully owner Vincent* ""Meh, Shit happens""; Balthier said it with a confident and leans over towards Melissa. He gave her a thank you kiss to Melissa's cheeks. She ran away and was so red she flees with a Haste spell. Her persona had then tried to Banished herself and Melissa banished her instead. (So the story ends and that's the end of Fantasy Dreams do come true)... ILY guys!"

Then as Melissa (She cosplayed as Sephiroth with her long as sword) and I walked down the elevator, I started to get yelled at. whistled and was suddenly chased. Somehow, my clouds was taken from me, and I was naked. Melissa saved me by getting out a whip cream bottles of cans she had and spayed my whole body. Again, I was chased by all the guys who were just wanting to get aa hold of me. About 10 minutes has passed and Melissa noticed there was a Vincent cosplayed and she ran off with him and disappeared. Bevi (she was cosplaying Ken from Weib Kreuz) yells at Melissa saying ""HOY!!!! Sephiroth! BAKADA!!! Ur suppose to watch over ur woman here. *She sighs* But, this is where it gets even more interesting. Bevi told everyone that this is her girl and whoever tries to get her must get through her. The crowded full of guys stomped all over Bevi and I said BAKADA KEN-KUN! So, I was finally saved by this other nice guy cosplaying as Farfarello. He used is was cry and called the other Weib & Schwarz Kreuz cosplayer and kicked the guys who were trying to molest me over my naked body with whip cream. Farfy then took me (it was my boyfriend who look so hot in that outfit of Farfy) and that's how it happy ended. Mean while, Melissa had molested this Vincent guy over and over. And it turned out it was Kelly who had cosplayed as Vincent in his demon form. Melissa was just laughing and did what she had to do to poor Kelly. THE END... What did u think about my AZ dream??? Funny right?"

"event","Here's the new latest recent scoop about Nagi... I've been feeling moody & sick. So, my other Teddy Bear looked up my symptons yesterday morning, I might have mixed bipolar mood shits. So, I need to write less on internet cuz I heard my shoulder pop the other day, and can barely play on my PS2/PS3 consoles. But, I will be trying to get some rest, but I can barely do that at night, Cuz all the pain inside me is just too ridiculously slowly getting me sick & crap. All hell is breaking out on the loose. Just think an Asian (Half Filipina & Espana) u saw *points out at Bevi & Schu* how I didn't act all comfortable with me stressing out and couldn't still not get over that. Especially the things gone either missing or messy Suboshi (Ni-san my 04 GT MUSTANG's name) left inside him. Now, it's much worst. I get bitchy and all that different emtional state that mom/females get when PMS is going to stop or starting to get it. I got that mood swings every second maybe half per second to equal a second. Anyways, I can't write now. I gotta send Schu's P.o.T. Game to her. But now, if u think u got it bad. I got it worst. I feel like I got in an accident cuz of my neck. Stomache cuz for almost 22 years now, I'm shitting bigger as usual pain in the ass that bleeds just like as usual. Need a doctor appointment but I have to get some moody pills & my appointment with my Oath of Allegiance of US Citizenship is right there in their hands. Takes forever just to get the damn immigrant officer on the phone. Waiting time is about 25-30mins but since they don't give out the phone number only address and number of gov't. stuff and been waiting for like 1hr. So, I hopefully can get over this shit before my B-Day comes, or I'll need to get into a mental hospital within no reach of help but might as well end it for Nagi. Bye now, oh and it's also likely I complain & bitchy mean to my poor 2 bfs. *Sniffs* ILY guys!"

Atleast I can cook! *Yelling to those ppl who thinks Nagi-Sempai can't cook cuz I look like a kid* *Sniffles* Hope u all had a good gobbling, my bf passed out yesterday first then half hr later I passed out then lastly was my bf's older brother fell asleep. Everyone else was still awake. lol. Anyways, I'm just getting really bad allergies right now and suddenly I don't feel like I can ever breathe but I do got my Benadryl w/me. They got 7 more kittens, I named one of them Crystal cuz it (Has no idea whether it's a boy or girl yet cuz they're only 1 wk old) got a crystal on it's forehead and back of it's neck. So, don't worry Kurosaki I'm getting very emotional too for no reason. All women go through it later or earlier it's normal. I thought oh man this could get worst... I really need to go to the doctor then get me some anti-depressant pills. I need it very badly. I don't want to have all these emotional things for no reason. I'm getting pissed for just not knowing y I am pissed. This sux! Men are lucky, they get no pms monthly, emotional stress daily, and all the confusing women stuff & etc.......... L8R! Sayonara...."

"event","Here's Count Lestat on my photobucket. Many say he's hot and it's true. I drew him. He doesn't come later in Chapter 62: ""Bitten by a Vampire"" Enjoy Count Lestat, but he's only a prince of blooderians (A bad vampire) and he's friend Count Donte, he's the oldest vampire and king of all vampirians (A good vampire) Blooderians like to suck any kind of bloods whether animals or humans or anything, Vampires like to only suck virgin bloods such as women only, and a vampirian is a half-breed of Vampire and Blooderian mixed in and are more powerful if mixed blood together in a single body. Vampiras are girls that get bitten by a Vampire like Count Donte, if they get bitten by a blooderian they are just plain blooderian. Just look up my username cream1285 and you can see more: http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f10/cream1285/My%20characters%20from%20story

"event","Now I know some of my friends read this story I wrote because at first I was dreaming it and suddenly decides to write it. Schu & I had fun writing it. It's got all of the genre in my story. Especially explicit hardcore sex stuff, you know the moaning and all. Hehehe. Back in 2002, that's when I first wrote it in High School Sophomore year. At the time I was writing it in my big, fat notebook. I'm suppose to have about 72 chapters in total. The problem with me is that I write too much. Like right now, my chapter 62 ""Bitten by a Vampire"" was about 146 pages in papers and it still hasn't been rough drafted at all... yet. Damn it!!!! I wanna publish it, but I'd like to post it on LJ. I'm sure you all will love it, it's mixed with alot of anime characters. The storyline is about angels living in Heaven's Gate and angels were forbid to love. Their Lord wouldn't let them, the mysterious between a Celestial-maiden and an Arch-angel has fallen in love with each other. When another celestial-maiden finds out that her best-friend (who is a princess maiden) has fallen in love, they were suddenly attack by an Evil Queen Sorceress. But I'd like to tell you more later about it."

"event","My stomach is hurting more and more than 3 weeks now. I'm feeling so sick!!!!! *Not puking... yet*... How is everyone? Schildig, I posted now. L8R guys... And to top that my mood swings are worst, like when I cry I don't know why I cry. I was mad at Puppy after I that I didn't notice I was even mad. So, I need to get to the Doctors but I'm waiting on my US Citizenship immigrants from WA and let me know when I can get it. And no I'm not an alien, I was a citizen when my mom became one when I came to US. It automatically made me a US. That was the rules in 1995, now it's all different laws, you can only get green cards aka alien cards (born from other than the USA) has to get married and stay married for 2 yrs. How do I know this? My Aunt from Phili got married almost 2 yrs ago. Wants to get out of marriage and tries not to stay with her husband. USA is very disappointing to me too, when I came I thought it was cool the first time I saw Fla airport. And I met my mom first in 5 yrs later and she still looks the same. True. Asian do have ageless. YEAH! Like I'm the one to talk, I'm gonna be 22 next year and I'm a lefty (GO LEFTY!) My grandma would still hit my left hand and force me to write it in right hand. All my family members are righty I'm the Lefty outcast. Night now, I'm getting pains (The worst usual from meningitis stage pain worstens). Sayonara!!!"

and every now and then SHE pops up in my head, and it makes me hate her more for being so deeply rooted in there. it was nothing but a child like infatuation, nothing more.

THEY have a relation ship that im slightly jealous over. And then theres even another one that makes me question what keeps THEM, together. Whats the fascination with shitty guys?

as the not as great as mitch hedburg, dane cook once said: it seems like when your not in a relationship, everyone else is in a relationship.

is it so hard to find good girls these days? signs point to yes, and the best one ive met so far is about 5000 miles west

"event","here i am at beaches, a wonderful resort on the island(s) of turks and caicos. while a little familiar to the dominican republic, this place is actuallyt much nicer with warm pool water oceans with no waves. so theres nothign to do in the 2x more salt then jones beach water. unless you wanna ride on the banana boat.
the resort part is nice. free everything. EVERYTHING. i wake up to a straight shot of whiskey and drown my sorrows all day. an hour does not go buy without one of the splended mixed drinks in my hand. if you happen to be around, ill meet you at one of the 4 pool bars on the resort. as for my other daily commodities, the cigarette selection here is very low, so i havent had one since the day i left. also i have not seen anywhere where i could pick up some fine cigars either.
the worst part: im here with my family so it sucks alot. point done. i did not htink i would be able to have any fun with these people breathing down my necks the entire time. i was right, even when i do find some solitude, it only emphases my complete lack of anyone else on the island to hang out with. so for a day or so i put up with talking to my parents and all their craptacular activities.
Couple days ago i was chilling outside the lobby when i met this really chill dude (he reminded me of anthony kaloseah back home). we talked about bullshit for awhile and as it turns out, he isnt even staying at the resort. hes staying with this group of even more chill kids at this villa like right down the beach. parents are aircraft parts designers, so theyre loaded. they just come here for the free shit. clutch, i know. anyway, the past couple of night weve just been satying out late drinking smoking pot and enjoying ourselves. its these times where the trip feels alot more like it should, but theres only one thing that could make it perfect. if my friends were here with me."

What do i care about, and how much is who or what worth to me? right now to help me put somethign on the second half is, im really feeling nothing. no push back. no response nothing.

March 30, 2008 10:51 a.m. EST

Jupiter Kalambakal - AHN News Writer

Vancouver, British Columbia (AHN)-- The Linux running on a Sony Vaio remained undefeated at the end of a three-way computer hacking challenge Friday at the CanSecWest conference.

Sponsors had wagered three laptops to anyone who could hack into one of the systems and run their own software. A $20,000 cash prize sweetened the deal.

The MacBook Air went first; Independent Security Evaluators' Charlie Miller took the Mac after about two minutes work on Thursday. Miller took home $10,000, courtesy of 3Com's TippingPoint division, in addition to the new laptop.

After two days of work, Shane Macaulay finally cracked the tiny Fujitsu laptop running Vista on Friday, with a little help from his friends.

Macaulay said the flaw he exploited was a cross-platform bug that took advantage of Java to circumvent Vista's security.Macaulay said he chose to work on Vista because he had done contract work for Microsoft in the past and was more familiar with its products.

TippingPoint Manager Terri Forslof said several attendees tried to crack the Linux box, but nobody could pull it off. She noted that some had found bugs in the Linux operating system but many of them didn't want to put the work into developing the exploit code that would be required to win the contest.

i tell you im a whirlwind of change.

theres just somethign that ive been thinking about lately that i have to get out:

As much as i complain and bitch my way through my life which i always claim sucks, there was a short period in it where i felt like one of the most happiest and fulfilled guys alive. Even though thats now gone from me, i'm still lucky to have experienced a relationship such as that. In all honesty, i feel like i may never feel that way about another person ever again. In relating it to pole vault, the bar has been raised so high during that time, and no matter how much training i do, i  may never equal that height again.

I look on this perspective positively, because some people go their entire lives and never feel that way, and im one of the fortunate few who have.

I feel no hostility towards you, and I do respect your decisions. As for my faults, I apologize."

and when you come inside, into the front
you do the freak, spank, and do the bump
and when the sucker mc's try to prove a point 

we're treacherous trio, we're the serious joint
a from sun to sun and from day to day
i sit down and write a brand new rhyme
because they say that miracles never cease
i've created a devastating masterpiece
i'm gonna rock the mike till you cant resist
everybody, i say it goes like this
well i was comin home late one dark afternoon
a reporter stopped me for a interview
she said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
that i'm vicious on the mike and the turntable
this young reporter i did adore
so i rocked some vicious rhymes like i never did before
she said damn fly guy im in love with you
the casanova legend must have been true
i said by the way baby what's your name
said i go by the name of lois lane
and you could be my boyfiend you surely can
just let me quit my boyfriend called superman
i said he's a fairy i do suppoose
flyin through the air in pantyhose
he may be very sexy or even cute
but he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
i said you need a man who's got finesse
and his whole name across his chest
he may be able to fly all through the night
but can he rock a party til the early light
he cant satisfy you with his little worm
but i can bust you out with my super sperm
i go do it, i go do it, i go do it, do it , do it
an i'm here an i'm there i'm big bang hank, im everywhere
just throw your hands up in the air
and party hardy like you just dont care

go hotel motel what you gonna do today (say what)
im gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank drive off in a def oj
everybody go hotel motel holiday inn
you say if your girl starts actin up then you take her friend
i say skip, dive, what can i say
i can't fit em all inside my oj
so i just take half and bust them out
i give the rest to master gee so he could shock the house
it was twelve o'clock one friday night
i was rockin to the beat and feelin all right 

everybody was dancin on the floor
doin all the things they never did before
and then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
she came into the bar, she came into the scene
she traveled deeper inside the room
all the fellas checked out her white sasoons
she came up to the table, looked into my eyes
then she turned around and shook her behind
so i said to myself, its time for me to release
my vicious rhyme i call my masterpiece 

and now people in the house this is just for you
a little rap to make you boogaloo
now the group ya hear is called phase two
and let me tell ya somethin we're a hell of a crew
once a week we're on the street
just a-cuttin' the jams and making it free
for you to party ya got to have the movies
so we'll get right down and give you the groove
for you to dance you gotta get hype
so we'll get right down for you tonight
now the system's on and the girls are there
ya definitely have a rockin affair 
but let me tell ya somethin there's still one fact
and to have a party ya got to have a rap
so when the party's over you're makin it home
and tryin to sleep before the break of dawn
and while ya sleepin ya start to dream
and thinkin how ya danced on the disco scene
my name appears in your mind
yeah, a name you know that was right on time
it was phase two just a doin a do
rockin ya down cause ya know we could
to the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
come alive girls get on your feet
to the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
to the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
to the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on
on n on into the break of dawn
now i got a man comin on right now
he's guaranteed to throw down
he goes by the name of wonder mike
come on wonder mike do what ya like

i say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
like a millionaire that has no money
like a rainy day that is not wet
like a gamblin fiend that does not bet
like dracula with out his fangs
like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
like collard greens that dont taste good
like a tree that's not made out of wood
like goin up and not comin down
is just like the beat without the sound no sound
to the beat beat, ya do the freak
everybody just rock and dance to the beat
have you ever went over a friends house to eat
and the food just ain't no good
i mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed
and the chicken tastes like wood
so you try to play it off like you think you can
by sayin that youre full
and then your friend says momma he's just being polite
he ain't finished uh uh that's bull
so your heart starts pumpin and you think of a lie
and you say that you already ate
and your friend says man there's plenty of food
so you pile some more on your plate
while the stinky foods steamin your mind starts to dreamin
of the moment that it's time to leave
and then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin
into something that looks like cheese
oh so you say that's it i got to leave this place
i dont care what these people think
im just sittin here makin myself nauseous
with this ugly food that stinks
so you bust out the door while its still closed
still sick from the food you ate
and then you run to the store for quick relief
from a bottle of kaopectate
and then you call your friend two weeks later
to see how he has been
and he says i understand about the food
baby bubbah but we're still friends
with a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
the hip hip a hop a you don't stop the rockin
to the bang bang boogie
say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
i say hank can ya rock 

can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop
can ya hip me to the shoobie doo
i said come on make the make the people move

i go to the halls and then ring the bell
because i am the man with the clientele
and if ya ask me why i rock so well
a big bang, i got clientele
and from the time i was only six years old
i never forgot what i was told
it was the best advice that i ever had
it came from my wise dear old dad
he said sit down punk i wanna talk to you
and don't say a word until im through
now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
a time to live and a time to die
a time to break and a time to chill
to act civilized or act real ill
but whatever ya do in your lifetime
ya never let a mc steal your rhyme
so from six to six til this very day
ill always remember what he had to say
so when the sucker mc's try to chump my style
i let them know that i'm versatile
i got style finesse and a little black book
that's filled with rhymes and i know you wanna look
but the thing that separates you from me
and that's called originality
because my rhymes are on from what you heard
i didnt even bite and not a go word
and i say a little more later on tonight
so the suker mc's can bite all night
a tick a tock yall a beat beat yall
a lets rock yall ya don't stop

"event","its funny how thoughts float around in my head. no. maybe not funny. just strange.

You think of past experiences and say, i wonder what i couldve done diffrently, why did i do that, and why didnt i say this. I can create huge monologs in my head that would be fitting for any occasion, but when the time comes, and im put in the spotlight, i fumble around with my words, sounding like an uneducated idiot (i partially am) and no point gets across. 

i was home ""sick"" today. not really sick, but more of just a 'noones going to be in school, nothings going to happen id rather stay home and play half life' day."

"event","last night, i felt great doing backwork. i felt free moving tables. i loved the two sony headphones inserted in my ears. I like having the music pumped so loud as to assure my timely deafness, drowning out the words of my coworkers. Steve drove me home. we stopped at the gas station for gas, cigarettes and bit-o-honey. we didnt go straight home. we talked and chilled. it was enjoyable.

i worked stright for 2 days, then came home, went to a bass lesson, and then out again to a communion. i got what i wanted when i became the top 5 in the counterstrike moc server fro a while, then the game ended. it was there that i shined. that one point in time, rewarded by my mouse pointing reflexes and intuition with an ak47 in the hands of my digital character. I took out the jeep today for a joyride. Top down, wind in my face. Nothing compares to merging with your giantg suit of armor traveling at 50 mph through the means of a simple clutch and stick shift. Its an experience i really like. now im so tired, my eyes tear with allergies. i have smelly hair, and barely managed a shower in the past weekend. 

simply put, im a mess."

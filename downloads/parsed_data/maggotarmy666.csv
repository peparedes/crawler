Sometimes life gets hectic.
Our world seems ascew and everyone seems to pressure us.
We stress out.
We fall and we fail.
Everything we do seems to be wrong.
Nothing seems to be accomplished.
We sit around and sulk in our feelings.
Shutting out those around us.
But if we shut out our friends and family how can we ever be happy again?
How can we gain the help of our friends and loved ones?
If you shut out everyone, how will you know if anyone cares?

Open up your eyes when you are down.
When life is a bitch, slap it in the face.
Show it who is boss.
Dont let the small things get you down.
Your friends are always here for you.
And if not them...
I'm here for you.
Whenever you need me.
I mgiht not be able to do much,
But i can still try to help, and comfort you.

Never forget me or those around you.
We care for you and we always will.
Take life one day at a time. 
Take it slow.
Concentrate on what is important.
But have fun and don't overstress your self with work.
You control your life.
I'm here to help though.
So always rely on your friends and loved ones.
They will be here for you,
One way or another they'll be here.

"event","woohoo i'm goin to beccas house in like 4 hours. i'm s0o0o0o happy lol. but i hope her parents dont make us go to fiesta texas to get beccas season pass thingy cuz that would take a long time and me and ehr wouldnt get to be alone alot....which is her moms idea. oh well i dont think were gonna go. 

yesterday was emily's birthday!!!!!!!!!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY EMILY!!!!!!!!!!  her, travis, shannon and her cousin lora went to the zoo during the day and i was going to go with them but i had to go up to austin to help my grandpa cuz he just got out of the hospital from some sort of heart surgery i think. well after that i went and met them at Chesters Hamburgers (best hamburgers ever) i didnt eat though because i had pizza at Conans in austin (best pizza ever). oh well they ate and then travis had to leave and after that we went back to emily's house for cake, which btw was rally good :). after cake we went down to emilys garage to play on teh guitar and drums. it was fun. then we came back upstairs to ehr house and decided to go to the movies. we went and saw ""Fever Pitch"" i guess it was pretty good considering i dont usually like movies like that. oh well, after that i had to go home and so i did and talked on aim and went to bed.

now its today and i cant wait till i get to see becca....s0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o um yea.......nothing else to write i gues.....lalalalalalala.......

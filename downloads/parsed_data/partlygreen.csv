check the link, i'm too lazy to do any hotlinking.

Didn't we kill this guy though?  I mean, didn't they (being ""us"" the US) kill this guy?  I thought we had a parade about it a few months (years?) ago.  We bombed his secret palace and won certain victory over the war on terror.  
This is so confusing.  The longer this war goes on, the more it seems like a Philip K. Dick novel...and not the part of the Philip K. Dick novel where the main character realizes he is prevy to a global conspiracy to manipulate the masses--this is the part of the Philip K. Dick novel where the guy realizes that he has lived this existence over and over again, infinitely and eventually meets the antagonist in a white room or something.
That reminds me of one of the last scenes in Brewster's Millions where Richard Pryor realizes he's about to lose the contest but then he wins it."

I heard about this on the news the other night.  Some guy got shot in the arm during a robbery of Mexican Imports in Fort Smith, AR.  I couldn't help but think about how much a robber would regret shooting me in the arm if I weren't killed in the process.  This isn't because I would come back swearing revenge on them, more so because of how much I would bitch about getting shot in the arm ala Tupac in the wheelchair.
<img src=http://www.2pacworld.co.uk/images/2pacWheelchair.jpg>
First, (after the cops arrived or before if there were other customers in the store) I would hold the place on my arm where I got shot really tight, being careful to show people the hole ""accidentally"" if they happen to be walking by.  This would be intermittently followed by lots of ""ow""s and ""ooohh""s for effect.  
Second, I would feign shock and start telling everyone around me how I was just shot and how ""I just can't believe I was just shot in the arm"" along with a few ""what are the chances"" throw in.    I mean, in this day and age, it seems like people get shot in the arm all the time.  And what is it with 50 Cent getting shot like 13 times?  
Third, I would call in sick at work telling them ""I was shot dammit"" before they could even tell me I have the day off.  I mean, c'mon, can you really get mad at a guy who just got shot in the arm.  GET OUTTA HEE!
Fourth, see third example X about 40.
Fifth, I would get a bullseye tattooed around the bullet hole scar."

"event","saturday night halloween party.  complete with 'ectoplasm' and cardboard gravestones.  dressed as a depressed 90's gender-specific wall.  my wall paper kept falling off and paper cutting me when i tried to smoke.  the marks from the duct tape turned into open wounds.  randy wore the rest of the duct tape.  all over.  word is it really hurt coming off of his hair and eye brows.  people from the party next door ended up coming over when they realised that the party we were at was the one they were trying to get to.  they were from tulsa and didn't know any of my friends.  good times.
went to another party with free booze but it smelled like throw up.  should've drank (drunken?) more this weekend because now it's monday and that fucking sucks.
more halloween parties tonight though.
skipped out on being jordan catilano.  it's all about crazy fucking shit that falls off throughout the course of the night.  last year's 'halloween decoration' costume had the similar vibe."

"event","As my eyes caught a glimpse of the morning light cutting through the living room window I remembered everything that happened the night before.
It was 1972 and I drove this car all aroung town listening to the car commercials and local heroes spout slogans, directives, opinions, harmonies, and quips through the air waves at 100hz-8khz.  The car was yellow but made of steel almost iron gliding down the street with no word as to its driver's origin.  
""Are you looking forward to test day?  Have you talked to David yet?  You're not going to be here?  You have to watch the farm?  Thank you very much.""
I got in touch with Sandy and procured some Quaaludes for tonight.  Not really sure where I'm going to go or what I'm going to do.  Not even sure if 1972's technology will catch this car thief or what 1972 would do to a car thief.  Tried finding my parents but it was way too confusing.  It wasn't necessarily scary as I've encountered them several times in my dreams, in the past.  I think it would be more of a shock to me were I put directly into that situation.  
Finding other relatives would probably go more smoothly as my clothes and hair allow me to blend into the 70's without due process.
I want to watch cartoons.  Cartoons in the 70's were exciting.  Maybe I should just wait another 10 years.  Then I'll be 36.  How did I end up here?  How is it that I was born in 1979 but turn 33 that year?  Will I just keep going?  333?"

Lately things haven't clicked and so with this I knew a plan had to be engaged.  I unlocked my car door to find a note on the windowshield attached to the windowshieldwipers.  ""Get back in the car, put it in neutral, open up the console,"", said note, ""empty out contents of glove compartment onto left floorboard and wait.""
I didn't know exactly what to expect this hour as the sun was just beginning to set and it seems as though my vision was getting worse by the minute.  I dumped my contents and waited...I waited, checking the note many times that hour.
Immediately after seven-thirty, Post Meridian, Central Standard Time, I saw perched up in a tree a gray owl.  I exited my car wondering ""what are the chances that an owl, at this time, would appear at seven-thirty on such a winter's day?""
I was shocked as my abandoned my car, watching it roll down the steep hill straight into a barrel of trash cans.  Amid the chaos of the wreck and the ensuing argument with the police officer, watching, was the owl in the tree.
""Don't go chasing waterfalls my good sir.""  the owl said.
""Don't go chasing waterfalls, my good sir, your shit won't get all collided!!""  the gray owl said.

"event","Step one is find out all of your assets. Be it pennies from the ceiling, the ceiling drips pennies after it rains, and the smell of copper permeates--find your assets.


Step two is to liquidate your assets. Liquidating your assets consists of changing them all to usable form, i.e. utilitarian. If you have rolls of quarters, use them to hold up the chair in the foyer. If you have a mass of coincidentally-holed nickels, stick a ribbon through them and wear them around your neck. If you have a bunch of pennies, trade them in for a pencil and paper to come up with a plan to find more pennies to trade in for...etc.


Step three is to see your lawyer. ""Your lawyer""--as ambiguous a term as it sounds--is always an important step. In every thing. My lawyer was found on account of having the same last name as an old childhood neighbor. Do you want to know my neighbor's name? The deciding factor?


Step four is to neutralize. Your acids and bases always need neutralizing. I woke up one morning to a distinct hissing sound. My dog had chewed a small hole in one of my lighters. A clear lighter. The lighter had to be taken out with the trash in a manner of utmost security, a neutralizing manner.

"event","He waited for what seemed like forever.  She had called the cops or so she said.  Anything could have happened, the rules don't apply to her because she's mental.  All that worrying.  It had been a while since the claim so nothing was thought of it after a couple of hours.  The loud knock was telling enough.  Only cops knock that loud and obtrusive.  As he answered the door, the dog leap for it.  Rupert Johnson?  I guess you know why I'm here, I'll need to talk to Charley Arnold too.  Inevitability was a killer, it kills the future in the present but somehow leaves the future alone.  I've just been from Janna Arnold's she claims that you stole a coffee table, a television, and a pair of gold earrings.  You're in trouble too Mr. Johnson, we're trying to solve this without criminal charges.  The idea that Janna was trying to get around ""punishing"" Rup and Charley was ridiculous.  The officer's words rang like a one-liner.  Not trying to charge us with anything huh?  Thinking about it, this made sense.  Janna had called with the ""call the cops"" warning but had also added that we should hide our pot.  Having hidden his stash in, of all places, his mailbox, Rup slightly believed the cop's statement.  I'm sure drug charges only added to the confusion.  Janna said the door to her room was deadbolted and that there would be no way for you guys to get in.  She said that you have a lock-pick kit Rupert.  It was true, and as he said this a tight mental-closeup was projected in Rup's mind.  There was a reason the kit could only be bought on reservations.  No, I don't know what she's talking about.  I don't have a lock-pick kit.  In his head, Rup flashed a cartoon smile with cartoon sweat dripping from his cartoon forehead while he pulled his collar out with his right index finger; obviously the policeman saw the contrary, nothing more was blatantly said about the lock-pick kit.
Are the items here?  Can I take a look?  Yes, you can.  The items are here.  Well, if you just take the items back, Ms. Arnold said she wouldn't file criminal charges.  Just the words of it all sent shivers down his spine.  Had it really come to this?  Two sisters fighting over a beat-up coffee table?  But no, they weren't fighting, Janna was demanding.  We have the coffee table and the television but no gold earrings, Charley is allegic to gold.  She can't wear it.  Geez, how stupid that must've sounded to the cop.  Why the hell would Rup's girlfriend steal some gaudy earrings to pawn, and nothing else?  I'm sure those flutes or even that dog of hers could get more.  Janna also said, Ms. Arnold, that you threatened to kill her dog and herself.  With any other sister this would have been the trump card, it would also have been unheard of.  No, I didn't threaten to kill her, she threatened to kill me!  Calm down Ms. Arnold.  She just wants her things back.  Calm down, this was ridiculuos.  ""We'll do whatever it is we have to do to make this as easy as possible.""  It had been that Rupert spoke the golden words.  Now the cop was in his sweaty palms even as they seemed a guilty party.  A policeman's job nessecitates that he or she be a ""take-charge"" type of person.  Dealing with weasels and rats day, the officer takes note when one is corgial and respectful.  As a certain amount of steel stoicism escapes their vacinity, the quick-tongued has a chance to pounce--leaving in his wake a vast record of faux honesty necessary in such fast-paced situations.  Okay, I've got to go now Mr. Johnson.  I don't mean to cut you off but I have to join an officer in pursuit.  Just take the stuff you have back to her tomorrow.  You don't have to be there first thing in the morning, just so long as you take it back tomorrow I'm sure everything will be fine.  Thank you Officer...Rup spies...Lee.  If you want someone over there while you're dropping it off just call up to the station.  555-...trails off.  Have a good night Mr. Johnson."

"event","In the winter of last year people were just getting used to the way things were.  People were getting used to getting ready for new things to occur the way they are supposed to happen.  In December the computer kiosks downtown across from Eda's Restaurant turned to stone.  There happened to be 3 people sitting at the kiosks at the time. Those people who had once been perched high-atop their chairs happy to have standing at a kiosk in such a busy district were flung from their seats onto their seats on the steps of nearby Wildon Arts Public Library.  Common was disbelief as the patrons of this stoney lay pulled themselves together and assembled around the computer kiosk.  All around, forming a large octagon, were gray impressions of 3 '99 Dells and 5 HP's of unknown origin.  What happened the next day seemed even more of a surprise to the residents of this local neighborhood.  A large cloak was found near the computers bearing the initials: J. R."

"event","A walk, a long walk.  Today I found out that the thing growing out of my foot (my '2nd ankle') is going to be troublesome and will require surgery.  Walking more to fit the tides, I don't have any trouble with it.  I wonder what cavemen did when they got arthritis and stuff.  Did they complain?  Did it even affect their lives?  Did they get braces?
I'm glad because I never got braces.
My foot has always been fucked, one way or another.  I had crutches in junior high because I had fluid in my left foot.  The doctor said that even though it didn't hurt there was fluid building up and if I walked on it then I would end up needing surgery.
I was a little self-conscious in junior high due to my babyface.  The babyface made me do things to fit in and not look unaverage.  I decided that this is the stage my brothers stayed in, I am older now.
So I would always walk around without the crutches sometimes because they hurt my underarms.  Luckily I didn't have b.o. back then so no can of worms.
My foot eventually quit swelling and I went on with my life.  Here I am again, at the Podiatric crossroads.  Cut the foot?  Save the integrity?  Space them all out and wait it out?  New outcome for the life?  I've always considered myself lucky for never having a broken bone or the braces thing.  I always knew in the back of my head that it would all even out somehow.  I figure that life gives me what I can take.  So anyways, I was thinking that if I have to get my foot cut off I'd rather get the whole shin taken off because: A) No more embarrassing leg hairs.  B) No more worries about getting my shin kicked in soccer.  C) Peg leg.
With most of the emphasis on letter 'C'.  Geez, I've wanted a peg leg ever since I was Peter Pan.  In fact, if I didn't NOT EVEN NOTICE, I probably was ecstatic about the proposition.  That is, if I woke up with a peg leg would it smell funny?  And if so, how?  My belly button smells one way because of the hair and dark hole.  My ears smell funny because of the wax.  Wouldn't the peg leg get stale if I didn't wash it everyday?  Are peg legs made out of wood always?"

"event","Jeff Huxley worked part-time as a librarian at the local expanding United Methodist Church.
The rest of the time Jeff mainly spent getting really drunk and stumbling 3 blocks to the market to get the nastiest stale nachos in existence.  The morning after Jeff would crawl around on the floor looking for his necklace.
Quite most of the time Jeff occupied himself, at the library, during the day shift but one fateful friday morning Jeff got a call that will haunt him for the remainder of his years (if he's not already dead!!), it was Connie, the head librarian (she NEVER called, this meant it was IMPORTANT).
""Jeff?""
""Yes Connie?""
""Jeff, we need you to come in this afternoon.""
""Instead of the morning, this morning?""
""Yes Jeff you need to come in at five.""
""Five?""
""Yeah, thanks Juff""
*click*
This meant that Jeff's whole routine would be fouled up.  What was Jeff going to do now?  Then Jeff devised a plan worthy of Napoleon himself: Jeff decided to get drunk BEFORE work.  This way, Jeff could still get drunk this day.
The plan was 12 shiners.  11pm saw Jeff Huxley parade into the nearest liquor store brandishing a 20 dollar bill.  
""12 pack shiner""
""Uh, sir, you have to walk over and get it I'm behind the counter.""
""Oh.""
3 hours later Jeff came back to the liquor store for MORE shiner bock this time brandishing only 5 dollar bill and 3 one dollar bills.
""I need a 6sic pack of twelve dollar bills, no I don't need twelve dollar bills wouldn't that be crazy I need a sixer of shiner.""
""Uh, sir, you have to walk over and get it I'm behind the counter.""
""Oh.""
2 hours later, at 4 o'clock, Jeff was hungry.  There were a particular style of nachos to be eaten.  These nachos came from a plastic machine at the market where the cheese came from bags and you had to walk 3 blocks.  He had to do it.  He knew he needed the nachos.  It was paramount at this point in Jeff's life that this particular want be met.
""I need some nachos.""
""Sir, the market is across the street.""
""Um, well, can I get a sixer of shiner then?""
""Uh, sir, you have to walk over and get it I'm behind the counter.""
""Oh.""
10 minutes later Jeff left the liquor store with a 22 of shiner.  His later needs were met and Jeff shuffled home soon after.
Off to work for Jeff he goes, late this time.  
""Jeff, were have you been?""
""There is no longer time."""

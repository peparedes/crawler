"event","I realized that most of my previous posts were about poo.  Hmm... POOOOOOO!  So I decided to stop.  Because who really wants to read about poo?  Which reminds me.  I touched a poo dollah yesterday.  :(  Luckly it was only one finger tip and I wiped the fecal on the the brick wall of Barnes & Noble as well as the window of Restoration Hardware.  Then I used lots and lots of soap at the bar... and when I got home I washed it again and again.  I wish I could microwave my finger but the microwave won't turn on with my arm stuck in the door."

On October 3rd, I replied, ""lisa, i'm throughly disgusted by your poop story. but when i pooped today, i thought i was having the same thing as you so i was all excited... but when i looked in the toilet, it ended up being a lot of slurry... meaning that poop came out like a faucet but it was no connected worm... sigh.""

The same day, L replied, ""hahhahahaha... alan, i can't believe how disgusting you are. my poop didn't shoot out to be that long, it took a long time to poop it out, i think that is why it didn't fall apart. slurry=gross."""

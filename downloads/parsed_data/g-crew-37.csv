Say what you will about the man, but he changed the face of geekdom with only three six sided dice and 1d20.

My own words, however, cannot possibly match those of Rich Burlew, creator of Order of the Stick, who <a href=""http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0536.html"">today paid tribute to Gygax in his strip.</a>

Last night at about 2:00 AM EST, Blizzard finally announced the long-anticipated Starcraft 2, marking a return to the franchise after a 9-year hiatus.  The game itself is set to launch in 2008, a full 10 years after the original changed the face of both Video Gaming, and the RTS genre itself.

<lj-cut text=""I am a geek"">
Oft-imitated, but never ever equaled, Starcraft's popular appeal has amazingly remained persistant for it's full 9-years of life to date, even in the face of newer, shinier, and more 3-D titles, people are STILL playing Starcraft.  The most extreme example of this is, of course, South Korea, where the Champions of  the National, professional Starcraft league enjoy a level of fame and accompanying lifestyle of the Rockstar variety.  And, at the lowest, pedestrian level, my University friends and I still try to meet weekly for ""Starcraft Night"", which has been everything from a dinner and chat night, to a full fledged, RTS tourney.

In 1992, I was introduced to Dune 2:  The Building of a Dynasty, largely accepted as the first modern Real-Time strategy game, and quickly became addicted.  I must confess to still getting chills up my spine at the thought of the soft, feminine voice of the House Atredies voice actor telling me my units were being slaughtered by the hundred...  However, 1994 saw me keyed more into titles such as Wing Commander - Privateer and Ultima VII pt 2 - Serpent Isle.  So much so that I completely missed out on a little title put forth by a tiny Studio called Warcraft:  Orcs & Humans.  It was my friend Shai who introduced me to Warcraft 2:  Tides of Darkness, and while I played it a little, I could never really master it, and I shifted my focus back to console gaming for a time.

Finally, I bought my own computer system in 1998, and the first game I purchased was Starcraft and I was hooked Instantly.  I leant it to my friends in University, who also became hooked, and thus began the first ""Starcraft Nights"", a proud tradition which continues to this day.

Starcraft has the distinction of having aged VERY well.  Blizz still continues to patch and tweak it, adding features discovered useful in their next RTS Effort, Warcraft 3, such as Map Previews and Minimap beacons -- an uheard-of level of support for an 8-year-old game.

Still, the faithful continued to hold out for a sequel, even after the release of the life-usurping World of Warcraft and it's expansion, as well as the disappointing rise and fall of the First-Person Starcraft:  Ghost.  Well, finally our prayers have been answered.  And best of all, it looks like the sequel is going to be as we had hoped and not as we had feared - faithful to the Original Starcraft and not to Warcraft 3.

Warcraft 3 switched the focus of the game from the Army to the Hero leading it, instead of building up a force of fighters, the goal was to level the Hero as fast as possible, thereby creating a force no foe could possibly stand against.  Although it has been revealed that there will be Unique units   within Starcraft 2, these units seem firmly planted at the Endgame, and not the first thing you pump out, as was the Hero.  In addition, the resource limit was capped at a disappointing 90, as opposed to the 200 points of control available in Starcraft, forcing the player to rely on small-unit tactics -- often limited to a single Battalion of units supporting the Hero.  Finally, the game suffered somewhat from Racial overload.  With Four factions to deveop and balance, Blizz seems to have extended itself a little far, and the tech trees of each faction seemed much less robust than previously seen in Starcraft. The Gameplay of each faction seemed a little more piecemeal as well, gameplay distinctions borrowed from our Favourite game, a little Zerg here, a little Protoss there...  Perhaps that was only the result of being the first Blizz produced RTS since they had produced the now Legendary Starcraft.

SC2 seems much more beholden to it's predcessor, though, as there are no heroes, they're actually INCREASING the supply cap, and they've resisted the temptation to add another Race, instead focusing on increasing the distinction between the Terran, Zerg and Protoss races.  It looks as if they've taken a solid, sober look at what made the Original Starcraft great and decided ""Yeah, we'll have some more of that, thanks.""

And I too, would like to extend my thanks.

Now all that's left is to try and contain myself until the damn thing goes gold.

"event","Interesting.  Two plays happening simultaniously in my life, and both touch on the subject of Racial Miscegenation -- a concept so goddamn foreign to this time and place in the world that it seems to come from another planet entirely.

Unfortunately, the only planet that could possibly come up with such an insipid concept as Miscegenation laws is our own.  The others we assume are blessedly bereft of Human life.  Ah, but I digress, of course, but I cannot for the life of me fatholm the sheer arrogance it would take to impose legal regulation on whom one is and is not allowed to LOVE, not to mention the despicable racism inherent in drawing the boundries along racial lines.

It seems that no matter what we do, Love is to be feared and outlawed, while hatred is fostered and institutionalized.  Love, the abandonment of such petty distinctions between monkeys and the acceptance of one another on a fundamental level...  Ultimately diffusing, and ultimately threatening to an ideology of hatred.

I remember back when I was doing Wedding Band, which was all about an interracial couple during World War 2, thinking about the societal bonds which keep us apart, and how ridiculous they all are...  I dunno...

To take a more perverse example:  It's like that George Carlin sketch where he talks about his lack of understanding as to why Prostitution is illegal:  ""Of all the things you can do to someone, giving somebody an orgasm is hardly the worst thing in the world!  In the Army, they give you a medal for SPRAYING NAPALM ON PEOPLE, Civilian life, you go to jail for giving someone an Orgasm.  Maybe I'm not supposed to understand it.""

You and me both, Georgie."

My longtime readers (yeah, right), are probably well aware of my touch-and-go relationship with Dell, but I'd like to assure one and all that the thing is working well and living up to my expectations.

It's light, it's powerful, and I'm not sure what else to say.  It seems to run the usual suspects (ie. AutoCAD, Litewrite, Excel oops, I mean OpenOffice,) effortlessly, although not being possessed of a Dongle I can't test out it's ability to run more esoteric programs like WSYWIG and Lightjocky...  Not that I own a copy of WYG to begin with, but there you go.

Vista continues to run fairly well...  There are problem with the drivers for the Dell Wireless card I got, which causes a staccato hiccup in the audio when it's turned on.  I loaded the XP drivers instead of the Vista ones for this card, which minimized the effect, but didn't eliminate it completely...  I'm hoping Dell jumps on this problem and updates ASAP, as this is pretty much my only complaint with the machine.

The video drivers were a little more difficult to come by, but as anyone who's tried to run anything graphically intensive on a laptop will tell you, only a monkey would try to make use of the drivers NVIDIA or god help us, Microsoft offers you.

Fortunately, <a href=""http:\\www.laptopvideo2go.com"">Laptop Video 2 Go</a> is THE place to go for modded NVIDIA drivers, and video-wise, I'm purring like a kitten.  (ATI fans out there should try <a href=""http:\\www.driverheaven.net"">Driver Heaven</a>. My old PC had an ATI card, and I simply do not know what I would have done without them.)

So, all's well, as they say, hopefully this little wonder will serve me well for quite a few years to come.

"event","Sunday Telegraph Article From today's UK wires: Salute to a brave and modest nation - Kevin Myers, The Sunday Telegraph LONDON -

Until the deaths of Canadian soldiers killed in Afghanistan , probably almost no one outside their home country had been aware that Canadian troops are deployed in the region. And as always, Canada will bury its dead, just as the rest of the world, as always will forget its sacrifice, just as it always forgets nearly everything Canada ever does.

It seems that Canada 's historic mission is to come to the selfless aid both of its friends and of complete strangers, and then, once the crisis is over, to be well and truly ignored.

Canada is the perpetual wallflower that stands on the edge of the hall, waiting for someone to come and ask her for a dance. A fire breaks out, she risks life and limb to rescue her fellow dance-goers, and suffers serious injuries. But when the hall is repaired and the dancing resumes, there is Canada, the wallflower still, while those she once helped glamorously cavort across the floor, blithely neglecting her yet again.

That is the price Canada pays for sharing the North American continent with the United States, and for being a selfless friend of Britain in two global conflicts. For much of the 20th century, Canada was torn in two different directions:

It seemed to be a part of the old world, yet had an address in the new one, and that divided identity ensured that it never fully got the gratitude it deserved. Yet its purely voluntary contribution to the cause of freedom in two world wars was perhaps the greatest of any democracy.

Almost 10% of Canada 's entire population of seven million people served in the armed forces during the First World War, and nearly 60,000 died. The great Allied victories of 1918 were spearheaded by Canadian troops, perhaps the most capable soldiers in the entire British order of battle. 

Canada was repaid for its enormous sacrifice by downright neglect, it's unique contribution to victory being absorbed into the popular Memory as somehow or other the work of the ""British."" The Second World War provided a re-run. The Canadian navy began the war with a half dozen vessels, and ended up policing nearly half of the Atlantic against U-boat attack. More than 120 Canadian warships participated in the Normandy landings, during which 15,000 Canadian soldiers went ashore on D-Day alone. Canada finished the war with the third-largest navy and the fourth-largest air force in the world.

The world thanked Canada with the same sublime indifference as it had the previous time. Canadian participation in the war was acknowledged in film only if it was necessary to give an American actor a part in a campaign in which the United States had clearly not participated - a
touching scrupulousness which, of course, Hollywood has since abandoned,as it has any notion of a separate Canadian identity.  So it is a general rule that actors and filmmakers arriving in Hollywood keep their nationality - unless, that is, they are Canadian. Thus Mary Pickford,
Walter Huston, Donald Sutherland, Michael J. Fox, William Shatner, Norman Jewison, David Cronenberg, Alex Trebek, Art Linkletter and Dan Aykroyd have in the popular perception become American, and Christopher Plummer, British.

It is as if, in the very act of becoming famous, a Canadian ceases to be Canadian, unless she is Margaret Atwood, who is as unshakably Canadian as a moose, or Celine Dion, for whom Canada has proved quite unable to find any takers.

Moreover, Canada is every bit as querulously alert to the achievements of it's sons and daughters as the rest of the world is completely unaware of them. The Canadians proudly say of themselves - and are unheard by anyone else - that 1% of the world's population has provided 10% of the world's peacekeeping forces. Canadian soldiers in the past half century have been the greatest peacekeepers on Earth - in 39 missions on UN mandates, and six on non-UN peacekeeping duties, from Vietnam to East Timor, from Sinai to Bosnia.


Yet the only foreign engagement that has entered the popular on-Canadian imagination was the sorry affair in Somalia, in which out-of-control paratroopers murdered two Somali infiltrators. Their regiment was then disbanded in disgrace - a uniquely Canadian act of self-abasement for which, naturally, the Canadians received no international credit.

So who today in the United States knows about the stoic and selfless friendship its northern neighbour has given it in Afghanistan? Rather like Cyrano de Bergerac , Canada repeatedly does honourable things for honourable motives, but instead of being thanked for it, it remains something of a figure of fun.

It is the Canadian way, for which Canadians should be proud, yet such honour comes at a high cost. This past year more grieving Canadian families knew that cost all too tragically well."

I am writing today to express my deep concern and frustration in my dealings with Dell, specifically with Dell Financial.  It was not without a good deal of trepadation that I applied for Financing in the first place, but after thinking long and hard over my options, I decided that Financing my purchase through Dell would be for the best.  Since then, my experience with your company has been nothing short of aggravating.

<lj-cut>
Originally directed to one Mohammed Khan, I called him on the Afternoon of Wednesday, March 14th to try and discuss the available plan, as well as emailing him my prospective system specs.  Unfortunately, his voicemail box quoted a date of Thursday, March 8th, and I was afraid that he had since gone on Vacation, and that the reply sent to my inbox was an automated reply. 

Wanting to get started on my order as soon as possible, I called the regular Dell 1-800 number, this time being connected to Syeed Sk.  Mr. Sk was very helpful in the construction of my machine, but he had the misfortune of being the first to propagate a trend in my dealings with Dell -- the promise and subsequent lack of a return call.  Mr. Sk said he was going to ask me 3 security questions in order to proccess my Credit application, but then said that Dell Financial was having system problems, and promised to call me back within 2 hours.  I have not heard from Mr. Sk since that night.

However, at 5:30 that afternoon, I did hear back from Mohammed Khan, who emailed me with a list of the security documents I would need to send over in order to complete my order.  Wondering what had happened to Mr. Sk and his 3 questions, I called Mr. Khan, who explained the types of documents I would need to send off in order to process my application.

I faxed copies of my SIN Card, my Passport and a Legal document from my employer at the Stratford Festival of Canada, from whom I am renting my apartment stating that I indeed lived at the address provided, as well as a copy of my Rent/Utilities Payroll Deduction authorization to Mr. Khan during my lunch hour on Thursday, and was quite dismayed when I received an Email from Mr. Khan that evening to the effect that the Documents had not been received by him.  I immediately attempted to contact Mr. Khan, but he was not available for the rest of Thursday.

That Friday, I scanned the documents and Emailed them to Mr. Khan, and called him to let him know they were on their way, but, predictably, there was no answer at his desk.  I tried calling at regular intervals during the morning, but there was no response.  Finally, I called customer care, who directed me to Mr. Marc-Andre Bourgon, who helpfully received another email containing my documents, and passed them along to the Financial Department.  Mr. Bourgon explained that Dell Financial usually has a 4-hour turnaround regarding processing information of this kind, but told me he would be in contact with me regarding my order that evening.  By the end of Friday, I had still heard nothing.

Over the weekend, I attempted to contact Mr. Khan to inquire about the status of my order, but there was no reply.  I left messages, but didn't hear back from anyone.

On Monday, I called again, but both Mr. Khan and Mr. Bourgon were unavailable.  Once again, I called customer care, and was assisted by a charming young woman whose name I, unfortunately, cannot remember, who placed me on hold while she tried to get through to Financial Services.  I remained on hold for over 40 minutes while she tried to reach someone over there.  Finally she came back on the line and told me that she had been speaking to Financial Services, but in order to proceed with the order she had to speak to my salesperson -- Mr. Khan.  I wished her luck and resolved to check in on Tuesday.

This morning I called Mr. Khan at 9:00 and actually managed to get in touch with him.  He said he had received my documents and forwarded them along, and advised me that the Financial Department would need four hours to process the documents.  I told him that they had already had four days in which to do so.  He then told me he would check in them, and assured me he would be in touch within two hours.  This statement being somewhat familiar, I gave him my number but was not altogether shocked when 11:00 came and went without so much as a word from Mr. Khan.  I called Mr. Khan's desk, and left a message, checking in now and again to see if he was available, but to no avail.

Finally, I called Mr. Bourgon, and was able to get in touch with him.  He apologized, said he had been sick, and checked in with the Financial Department, only to discover that they were waiting for me to send in a major utility bill.  Apparently, no one had bothered to tell me that my legal documents from my employer had been found unacceptable, and they were waiting for me to provide further information.  I explained to Mr. Bourgon that as my rent is inclusive, I did not have a major utility bill to send in, and advised him that the best course of action was to cancel my order.  He said that he had done this, however, the Dell website still lists my order as Processing.

I did not know if this was due to a delay in the Website, but just to be sure, I called Customer Care and spoke to a young woman who listened to my story and agreed to cancel my order.  As of 3:48, it is still listed as processing.  Please be advised that I wish to take my business elsewhere, or at least, I do not wish to deal with Dell Financial either now or in the future.  What with the evasiveness and nonresponsiveness of the customer service representatives, I count myself as lucky not to be locked into the Financing contract, as who knows whether or not I would have received any kind of communication with them once the contract became binding.  Please be advised that should I make a choice to purchase a Dell product, I will be paying through other means, and wish to have Loan Agreement xxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxx x stopped, if it has not been already.

Thank you for your time, and I do hope that my email is of use to you in your quest for a better Sales experience at Dell, as the Emails say.

Yours regretfully,

The stupid stupid rat creatures at Dell won't let my order go forward.  I've been at them for about a week now, and still my order is stuck in the ""Proccessing"" phase.  Perhaps it's my fault for selecting a financing option.  Perhaps it's my fault for subletting from the Stratford Festival for 5 months out of the year, but all indications seem to point to Dell Canada simply not wanting my business.

Simply put, they don't return my calls, they're always out of the office or otherwise unavailable, they put me on hold for a HALF HOUR AT A TIME, regardless of whether I say I'm on my Cell or not, and none of the reps I've dealt with seem to have any sense of customer retention or development.

The problem is, that their product is exactly what I'm looking for.  Lightweight, twice as powerful as anything in the shops with enough video card to choke a yak.  If it was not all these things, I would have long since given Dell the ol' Heave-ho and gone with someone who actually seems to want my business.

Welcome to Dell, how can we jerk you around today?"

UPDATE - Man, everyone on the stinkin' internet must be browsing this page, 'cause I can only get a search through about 1/10 times.  Also, a great number of really topical entries are either mashed, poorly put together or just plain devoid of any y'know, facts.  This leads me to believe that while the page may or may not have been intended that way, it has become a work of Wikianarchic Parody. The thing is, this site has been getting a lot of coverage by both Conservative and Liberal Blogs and webcomics, so I doubt that by the end of the week there will be any of the original content remaining.

"event","Blah.  Show's up.  Whatever.

I remember Mama.  We opened last night, and while I don't feel it was a bad experience, and I think it looks better than Clear Day did, Trelawney nonwithstanding, I'm feeling a bit disconnected and taken for granted.  I dunno...  I've completely rearranged my January and February around facilitating LDing Jerry's Girls, and while I get the feeling Joe is pleased, I'm not sure appreciative has crossed his mind yet.  To put it another way, I havn't gotten a heartfelt thank you out of the man for all the plugging and jigging and re-arranging I've needed to do in order to make this a reality for him.  In fact the only thing I feel he thinks of my work at the moment is lagged down by it.

Unfortunately, there's no alternative, I physically could not get things together any faster than I did before, even though Mama was up way quicker and easier than Clear Day, stupid shit has been holding it back (holiday deliveries, Gobos misplaced at the warehouse, doing a spacing run instead of a levelset...)  I'm also beginning to feel that (although only a fool would ever say it to my face) he sees Visitation days with Anastasia as a liability of hiring me as opposed to a condition.  I'm not sure I'd be any closer to finished if I hadn't given Thursday to Asia, though...  No levelset and a 2-day tech ""week"" means that I'm playing catch-up until at least the second week.

Y'know, now that I come to think of it, Joe didn't even extend a thank you to me on opening night...  I dunno what it means, but life would be much much easier if the COC would come through and I could get a little closer to working at the National level on a permenant basis.

Ah, well...  Just an observation."

These were two good friends and mentors of mine at the end of my Highschool career, whom along with Angela, encouraged me to persue something I loved.  As is typical of me this year it seems, I've been waxing nostalgic over my friends lost over time and tide.  These two moved to Japan shortly after I began theatre school and have left very little in the way of a web presence (as opposed to the madness that occurs when you google my name for example.)

Interestingly enough, it looks like Lori (the she), may have changed her name legally this year...  I found a government document detailing a change of name from Lori Jane Newman to Sorlie Madox...  That could only be one person.  Hopefully the trail isn't too cold.  I'd love to reconnect with these two... Ah, well, the hunt continues."

"event","I got to the theatre yesterday and got sick.  I mean SICK.  I tried to have a lie-down on the chairs, but it didn't really help, the place was freezing!  Then I tried to go to the bathroom, thinking I might throw up, but to say the bathroom smelled like a horse barn is an insult to horses, so I staggered out of there and went over to Shawn's, ostensibly to recover my wrench.

I fell asleep.  When I woke up it was about 7:00, and my window of opportunity had closed.  Ah, well...  No big deal, as Asia would say.  I'm already passably done for this gig, and with the little kids shows in hole-in-the-wall theatres like the Walmer, I can't really do much better than I have without gutting the place, and nobody could afford what I would charge to fix this disaster (mostly because I would overcharge so as not to get stuck doing it).

The best part of yesterday came when I was telling Dee about ""Cow & Monkey"", Anastasia's two hand-puppets my brother had given her for her 2nd Birthday, which develop a unique and witty life of their own whenever Daddy visits.  ie. Asia will hang out with her arm around Monkey, Cow will get jealous and beg Asia for hugs, and Monkey will wax eloquent about how much more huggable Monkeys are than Cows, etc.

While I was telling this story, Oriana was puttering around in that 16-month-old kinda way, and wandered over to her toys, and came back with a toy Monkey and handed it to Dee.  I thought it was cute, and Dee started making monkey noises, then O.J. wandered away and came back with a Cow...  And my jaw hit the freaking floor.

Just because she doesn't talk yet doesn't mean she doesn't understand every word we say...  Now I'm even more determined to have O.J. and Asia hang out."

I'm grateful, if a little perplexed, but I'm content to have a working laptop and delay getting a new one for as long as possible.  Right now I'm having the internal debate as to whether or not to go for the larger model for cheaper (as advocated by my Sister's boyf), or to go with the smaller model (as advocated by my back).

"event","Well, that's crap.

My workhorse of a laptop, which I have affectionately dubbed ""Karma"", as it's purpose in life is a portable design office/program workhorse/starcraft night gaming platform (what I am here to do, baby), is officially on it's last legs.

A refurbished Toshiba Satellite A-70, Karma was already a year old model when I got her two years ago.  She was also the display model, the last one available.  I got her due to glowing reviews from Angela's brother, James, and she didn't disappoint.  Although a single proccessor, Karma ran at 3ghz, although her heat and fan noise were always present and somewhat prohibitive.  In addition, she had a tendancy to overheat, often at inopportune times, leading me to a degree of infamy around the Avon for actually taking her apart in the Green Room to clean her heatsinks.  She had a wonderfully large displayscreen and a spacious, although not opulent hard drive, that allowed me a bit of room to kick back and play around in.  She ran software beautifully, despite her heat issues, and could run many applications at peak performance as long as her airways were clear.

Lately, however, she's begun to have display issues.  All the black-tones on her monitor have been going a particularly radioactive red, and other subtle pixel-tones have been going even stranger colours.  She does this off and on now, and although I can sometimes temporarily repair the problem, I'm of the opinion that poor Karma may not be long for this world.

Not that I begrudge my long-suffering laptop a noble end.  She's carried me through almost 2 full years of shows, walks, starcraft nights, and so on, even to the extent of becoming my primary PC during my triumphant 2nd season at Stratford.  (I had to leave Shinobi, my entertainment platform and desktop mamajama behind because I had no way to transport my desk.)  In addition, I feel she's more than payed for herself, not only facilitating an excellent 2nd Stratford Season, and in effect ensuring a prize position for next year, but she's crunched numbers for no fewer than Five CLOC shows, operated Moving Lights, and kept me sane during many a long train trip when I was between novels.

In fact, Karma only had two drawbacks to my reckoning:

<b>1. KARMA IS A HEAVY BURDEN</b> - Siddhartha H. Gautama was she ever heavy!  A 15.5"" display means lots of back problems for me, unfortuantely.  My next computer will have to be FAR more portable, I'm already oogling a nice little 12.5"" number for my next platform, when Karma's display finally hits the final nova.

<b>2. KARMA MUST REMAIN IN BALANCE</b> - A bit further a reach for this one's caption, but I stand by it.  Karma's proccessing power required a lot of heat and thus cooling.  The best way to keep her cool was to sit her on my lap.  This had the unfortunate side-effect of COMPLETELY IRRADIATING MY GONADS.  I seriously worry that my next child will have 3 heads thanks to Karma's influence.

So, if anyone has any reccomendations for my next PC, give me a holler, in the meantime, I'm gonna try and keep Karma's use to a minimum so I can prolong her life at least until I get back into Swan City and can start kicking ass again. (and not coincidentally begin to afford the payments I'll have to make in order to replace her).

Blah.  All the best."

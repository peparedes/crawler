"event","So we argued about my girlfriends parents treating her like a lap dog. She seems to want to let them do it, and I can't convince her to stand up for herself. She tends to think that if something doesn't work IMMEDIATELY then it's ""hopeless"" or ""not gonna work"".

Like yesterday. It was a good day overall. We argued about that and how she never speaks up when I'm bugging her about video games. "" I said something didn't I?"" You did, love. 6 months later. But Anyways, the kids were being really loud, and there was a baby trying to sleep. Hannah tends to ask the kids to be quiet, and plead with them. Hannah, not to sound like an overlord, but if you want them to listen, you can't give them the authority by begging, ok? And I know you've said you've tried everything, but the 2 and a half years I've been there you tend to only try two things. Yelling every 5 seconds, or pleading with them. On rare occasion you may ask their parents to yell at them, but I hope you listened well yesterday. 

Well, they were being loud, baby sleepin', yada yada yada, and Hannah had gone through her scold/ beg phases and I said ""They're being loud again."" And she tells me ""No, it's just hopeless."" For someone who gets dumped with kids all the time, there was no patience there. Anyways, I told her that she gives up to easy, and then I told them to be quiet. Upon saying that they continued to be loud. ""What did I just say?"" They quieted, but ignored the question. I repeatidly asked until one of the younger ones said ""I heard you, I heard you, I heard you, I heard you,...."" so on and so forth. So I said ""Good, then you understand"".

Rarely did they flare up with noise after that, but when they did it only took 1 correction from me. And they still didn't hate me later or cop an attitude with me. I just wish Hannah would do it the same way, but she's so goddamned nice that she just can't do it. She can't be strict just once. She'll probably reply with something she did, but I have yet to see her do anything to one of them herself that didn't involve the kid just playing a different game or coming back in 5 minutes and doing the same again in 20, except for the point system thing she had once, but she let her dad convince her she was being ""barbaric"" and won't do it anymore under the guise of ""Well, they behave just fine without it"" 

Sure. That's why Cory bugged us nonstop about the Xbox and gave Sean the ""bhuddists palm technique"" to the face for doing something he didn't like on the game.  That's why it was ""hopeless"", yesterday, right? Because they behave so well without it.

I thought you were going to tell your parents that you weren't baby sitting until they put a lock on the door? Decided it would be too much to argue about, or do you honestly just feel like being pushed around ALL THE FUCKING TIME?! Never holding your ground, always finding some excuse for it to be ""OK"" or ""Not the way we think it is"" 

I'm sorry, but I call bullshit. Seriously.

You avoid confrontation with them even though they run you around and set ridiculous rules for you. 

You avoid confrontation with your best friend Lindsey when she does wrong, worried you'll lose her or something. Like the time at her house when you guys talked through the movie, and we were like please don't, so you got all pissy, but then when Heather asked Lindsey a question about her movie Lindsey told her no talking, but then went straight back to talking to you.

Or all the shit I do that bugs you, but you never want to tell me, and yet if you look above, I'm not pissed that you stand up for yourself, I'm pissed that YOU NEVER FUCKING STAND UP FOR YOURSELF.

And don't give me that shit about you stood up for me. I understand and respect what you had to go through, but we pretended not to date and didn't kiss for a year, just because daddy thought it should be that way or he'll be angry, because it's his fucking relationship and your his fucking pet.


I'm sorry this is so mean, and should be deleted, but you need a fucking backbone, now.

Even if it starts with you getting pissed at me and going off I don't care, as long as you grow one and start to take care of yourself and stop letting everyone make your decisions and you pretend their yours, and stop letting people walk all over you, then I'll stop ranting.

God....dammit."

"event","So my girlfriend was worried she was pregger, and now we know she's not thank..........somebody, I don't know.....Trojan I guess.

Anyways, we got everything settled and we get along now. 

I told dad the other day I wouldn't do something and he temporarily took the car keys. Turns out he doesn't like my attitude when I don't show when, but instead show him up with a good point.

You see, he always tells people I'll do something for them without asking me first, then TELL me to do it with complete disregard for what I may be doing.

Because I said no to the last task, he also told me that I was selfish and needed to start thinking about people other than myself.

Not to brag, but let's go through the list here.

1) I've done all his random shit up until now.

2) When I was still in school I was in choir, and always stayed behind to clean up though I didn't have to, and nearly got pneumonia for it once when me and three other guys moved 200 to 400 chairs by ourselves in a thunderstorm.

3) In my last post I talked about how I nearly collapsed a lung looking for a missing friend in the cold.

4)I give people things, money, help, and most definitely RIDES all the fucking time.

5) I have offered to give up my newly bought system to a family I know that is less fortune after I sell their busted one to my workplace and PAY THE DIFFERENCE MYSELF.

6) I tell the sad, broken dreamed people at Wal Mart things will get better all the time.

7)My girlfriend gets pissed that I spend too much money on her, and give up warmth, food, etc. for her.

Basically what I'm saying is I'm not trying to be a flaming hypocrite through words alone, but I don't concern myself only with me.

Father dear was also angry that he could smell pot on one of my friend's friends, yet no matter what I told him, he apparently believed that saying ""I knew he did it, knew he would do it and watched him do it"" made it true. However, this was not the case, but he still kicked them both out from the house and threatened to kick me out as well.

He probably thinks I smoke pot as well. GRREEEAATT. I won't touch a soda or a bag of chips, but I'll smoke the reafer. Real brilliant dad.

I think his new ""Jesus butt buddy"" has put him through the unintentionally passed down and unintended brainwashing method with this circle of logic. ( I know this has nothing to do with what I'm talking about, but I think it's why he's had such a change of heart over stupid things)

God is right/exists because the bible says so----> The bible is right/accurate because god said so----> god is right/exist because the bible says so.

Now that I'm done with unrelated topics, he also found a condom, and told me to hide it better next time. At least that part of him that's like ""Go gettum tiger!"" is still there.


Oh, and the King Kong game rocks. 

Remember, LIFE IS A SERIES OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS. And is more likely nothing more."

"event","So, what is it I have to get out?
Later...

So I finish working out and shower and go to work, tense from my weight lifting. 3 hours later I come home and dad's like ""Wanna eat?"" And I'm like, ""kewl"".

Anyways, we go to DQ, and Dad takes the car with him to go to work, and I offer to walk home, because I'm talking to a friend. Then, some 17 yr old chick is like, ""You 18?"" and I'm like ""19"", and then a look of ""buy me some ciggerettes"" comes to her eyes. 

She gave me money and I was off, but I had left my wallet at home so I run home and grab my wallet, and as I grab it the phone rings and Heather's mom is like, ""She's missing"" and I'm like, ""Oh shat, brb"".

So I grab my bike, buy the ciggeretes, drop them off and head on my way to search for my best (but temporarily hard to contact due to my being gone all the time) friend. 

For two hours I look, and I even confront a gang to discover they are my friends. It was cold, so it was lucky I was wearing a sleeveless shirt like a dumbass. 

Anyways, I cycle home to call her mom, and her brother's like ""Found her"" and I'm like ""Where?"" and he's like ""She was in the car"" and I'm like ""WTF""

Then I call my girlfriend and tell her the story and she's like ""STFU mom and dad"", but they continue to be assholes and assume that every job a 19 yr old is going to obtain is going to have to ""take his life somewhere"" or something. So they moan that I'm not a 19 yr old goddammed CEO for a while and then Hannah went in the other room and I try to convince her that I don't have asthma, but her mom, whom is a NURSE.... not a DOCTOR, but a NURSE... diagnoses me with asthma over the phone, so while my gf's on hold I let out a mighty cough and defeat the weez I've had ever since the car blew up and smoke got in my lungs. It's been nearly 24 hours and I've yet to weez or cough violently since I finally got the last bit of tar smoke out, but tell that to my medically advanced voodoo doctor future mother in law and girlfriend whom takes her mom's medical advice on everything, even when she lies or makes up stuff (like the time she told her that it's impossible for women to cum during orgasm, or that spermicide is like, 50 percent effective even when used properly ((scare tactic if you ask me)) and the time she told her I had FUCKING ASTHMA THAT SHE DIAGNOSED OVER THE PHONE!).

So I go to sleep sastified that I was born with balls, ignoring the ringing phone as I drifted into a twelve hour nap. Literally.

And now, what you've been waiting for. What is it I have to get out?

Hannah, when I came over I saw an IM message, but didn't see whom it was from. I don't want to sound paranoid, but the fact that you closed it quickly as if to panic, and that it said *falls asleep in your arms* and some other cluttered stuff I don't remember, maybe because I don't want too, leads me to believe that you MIGHT, might be having a romantic/sexual relationship with someone else online or otherwise, or are at least thinking about it.

Is this true? False? Paranoia? Please be honest and give me every detail so that I can stop thinking about it night and day, day and night.

I love you. Enough so to be jealous sometimes. I'm sorry. 
I love you enough to be careful and honest too.
Please don't hide this from me if you are.

I love you no matter what, and if it turns out to be so, we'll work it out. I won't be mad....

As for the rest of you, life is short.
Be honest, get laid, and do what feels good, and stop worrying about what others think.
Even if the path you choose makes people think you're worried about what they think.
Bye, dammit."

"event","I've just noticed something.

Nobody does anything anymore without someone elses direction or permission. And by no one I mean the majority of course. But what I mean is we sign away things as permission that can't be signed away.

Alot of people on this site talk about death and darkness endlessly, and never seem to be happy or ever solve their problems, but their problems solve themselves sometimes. It's like they are asking the readers permission for a way out, and it's moronic.

If you are using it to vent, I understand. But to use it to frickin' drown yourself in sorrow is pathetic. Listen, I hate to sound like a high school counselor, but alot of your worries can be solved with an attitude adjustment, and alot of your problems can be solved by growing some balls. I hate to sound insensitive, but instead of sulking about being gay/atheist/muslim/prochoice, be proud of it and tell people. ""How can I tell them?"" 

Step 1) grow some balls. You only live once. Don't waste time being ashamed of yourself. You should only be ashamed if something is terribly wrong and is your fault. More than likely it's neither terribly wrong or your fault. Seriously. Did it hurt you? Someone else? No? Ok then. Be happy.

Step 2) Tell the people, or do what you have to (fight, move out, move in, divorce, whatever) and stop thinking and stalling so much and something you want so bad, just to save ""your image"".

Step 3) Check your attitude. If you didn't get it corrected and complacent before, it will automatically be fixed at this point, as long as space roaches don't smash your house. At that point go to step 1 again and repeat.

Oh, and by the way, if your worrying about something you can't control...like let's say...nuclear war, when you'll die (minus suicide), tornados, HOW SOMEONE FEELS ABOUT YOU OR HOW SOMEONE REACTS TO SOMETHING, then stop it.

Just stop it.

I hope that millions of emo kids read this.

And if you find that offensive, realize that I am a sensitive individual that listens to underground bands and wears all black and lets missing a soda with a friend ruin my year just like the rest of my friends.

At least I think they are my friends. They might not feel as deeply as I do. Feel. FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I've spent some time in Lexington to get a job at Amazon.com in one of their book moving places, but I basically had to sell my soul to work there.

How do they know I'm a delinquint?

Oh, yeah, that's right!

I have to unleash my little plan soon to move to Richmond.

Anyways, last night my girlfriends sister in law went berserk, and here's how it went.

(white truck pulls up gravel drive of farm next to my car) 
""Is Teresa here?""

Before sound can leave my mouth, Hannah answers ""Yeah"" and runs to get her.

(Truck screeches to meet her outside of the house.
Teresa screams ""Take care of the kids.......(unintelligable).....mom's bleeding.....(unintelligable)......"" and dashes to the car, unable to find her keys.
While looking, she is hyperventalating and screeching in attempting to find them, and finally does so, and takes off like a rocket. 

Knowing that my girlfriend is probably concerned more with whether Teresa makes it without harming herself or not, more so than her parents probably are, no offense, I offer to follow her.

The pursuit begins.

I had never drove so fast in my life. My foot could feel the floor as I flew down that country road into town, and I finally caught sight of that little maroon car with it's hazard lights going, trying to get around various vehicles. It dissapeared at the hospital, so I knew she made it in, but it didn't hit me until later last night...

I'm entirely sore from doing chinups and back and forward flips on bars. Fitness hurts so bad just so you can feel/look good later. Oh well.

I've sent my girlfreind emails about my new livejournal, but I don't think she reads them, ever. Nor does she respond. Nor does she seem to care sometimes.....maybe she's mad at me....I don't know. Maybe she doesn't care about my stuff as much as Lindsey's, her best friend. Not to sound like a jealous prick, but everything Lindsey does seems to be gold to my gf, but I hardly ever can find anything new to interest her that I like, NO MATTER HOW SIMILAR IT IS TO SOMETHING LINDSEY LIKES OR MY GF ALREADY LIKES.

But I'm sure you guys could care less. 
My dog seems to be pregnant. Makes me wonder why girls go through the things they do just to please someone. A dog has no knowledge that it will end up doing anything but making pups, but humans know what happens for every consequence. Why do girls go ahead with the whole pregnancy thing so willingly? Does society view it so positivley that they view it as a milestone? I don't think so, being that you spend the first 22 years of your life worrying about getting pregnant. I guess it's the whole marraige thing that turns the switch for most girls, but you'd think there'd be alot more who'd still be very appauled and scared of the idea. 

Personally, I'd be more worried that I had to go through the pain of squeezing something the size of a watermelon through a hole the size of a golf ball, and then raising that watermelon. Not being called a whore.

Too bad most of them will never even know the book exists, but I love to think that one day people will realize that evolution isn't about us evolving from chimps, because then there would be no friggin chimps! What happened was more along the lines of a split. All the other apes got hair, muscle, agility and the ability to digest anything.

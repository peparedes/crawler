"event","When my lease is up in March, I'll be moving back to Naples.

I cant afford to live out here anymore.


But I must say that I'm really proud of myself. It wasn't easy to move across the country, not knowing anyone, trying to make it on my own. I worked 2 jobs, gave %110 effort, I didnt quit and move back home when things got really hard. I stuck it out for a year, but I just cant afford it, and I'm tired of living paycheck to paycheck.





Look out Naples, here I come!"

It's not all it's cracked up to be. 
It's a very pretty city with hills and mountains and homeless people everywhere.

The weather is amazing, It's never hot and always sunny. NO HUMIDITY!

I still haven't found a job, our apartment is great but rent is ridiculous and I have no money.

I never thought I'd say this but I miss naples terribly.
Maybe I just miss the security of naples, knowing where everything is or not having to drive on 5 different highways, or knowing that I'll always have a job there.

Maybe if I had a decent job and wasn't so stressed about money I wouldn't want to go home so bad.

It gets better right?"

For doing the jobs that nobody wants to
And thank you very much, oh Mr. Roboto
For helping me escape just when I needed to
The problem's plain to see:
too much technology.
Machines to save our lives.
Machines dehumanize.

The time has come at last,
To throw away this mask
Now everyone can see,
My true identity...
I'm Kilroy! Kilroy! Kilroy! Kilroy."

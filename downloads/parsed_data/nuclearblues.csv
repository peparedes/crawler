"event","<small>This is the first public post thing in a while.. infact, It's the first post since November! So for all those that still have me on their friends list, a little update.

I met a guy. A decent one. He's called Terry. We've been dating for just over 2 months I htink.
Things got better... I quit self harm and I never feel the need to anymore.

That's about it! hahaha

And so did I.
With this belief I walked through door after door of different hurts and lies. Day after day and it finally occurred to me that I wasn't good enough. My fingers bled and beads of sweat fell down into my eyes as I vigorously tried to mold myself into someone.. some<u>thing</u> ""better"". I hid my bruises and scars I obtained through the years, because they screamed of my imperfections. I quieted my voice, I subdued my emotions, and silenced my thoughts. If this ""improving myself"" was gonna work, I needed all of the old me to be dismissed. But that was just the beginning..
After trying my hardest to kill who I really was and create a ""new and improved me"", I succeeded, and it worked; I got the attention I had been wanting. I finally felt like I was good enough. I had finally reached the incredibly low worth that lies bestowed upon me. I was blinded; I thought I was better. But then the lies stopped being my friends. They pointed their fingers at me and laughed. They called me plastic and a fake. They told me I'll never amount to anything because I believed everything they told me. They ripped away the last shred of dignity I had left and dubbed me worthless. Then they left me, groping and begging on my knees, trying to grasp them and make them stay.
They had won, I became <b>nothing</b>

But then God saw me, He turned to me and picked me up from the dirty floor. He held me and started speaking Truth into me, and for the first time, I could hear Him. He told me that I am beautiful. He said I am worthy and lovely. He said He is my King and I'm His princess. That He is my Father and I, His daughter. He made me feel like no one else could ever tell me that I'm not good enough.. because now I knew the truth. And today, I know the truth, <b>I am His, and He is <u>mine.</b></u>"

"event","Some things going on with me lately...


In 2010, I officially became one of the youth leaders. Getting to pour out everything I've been taught by God any mentors/influences in my life into these kids is amazing. It has taught me to grow up, or mature I guess, in my walk with God, making him everything and number one. 2009 was a year of breaking off any addictions or habits I picked up during my senior year, 2010 was a year of healing and restoring. (: Everything I have asked God to help me with or get rid of, he has. I'm now at a point where I don't crave my old lifestyle, all I want and need is him. Currently he's been teaching me how to trust, which is so amazing and freeing. I can't remember the last time I was afraid someone was going to leave me.. that is quite an amazing feeling. There's still more that needs to go, but I'm just not worried about it, cuz I know he's gonna keep on healing me and making me whole. He's also helping me see the beauty in everything again. Not just this world and people and who he is.. but even the hardships we go through and how those shape us into who we are and who he wants us to be. I think that is beautiful. Its like.. no matter what we've been through, God knows how to create good and beauty out of it. (: He's been restoring my joy which I have greatly missed the most and am so happy to have it back again (: I also was finally able to fully accept that God loves me. I was never really able to due to my trust thing. But one day after talking with a friend, I decided that I don't need to understand his love to be able to receive it.

It's always so beautiful with God.. I never get bored anymore. When something gets old, he shows you something else. He's so huge and unfathomable and mysterious. I love it. I've been asking him to write his truth on my heart so I can know it and then give me the boldness to stand up for it. 

I guess this past year was getting to know him better, falling in love more, and realizing that there is nothing better than him. It's like.. once you encounter his love, you can't go back to anything else.

I guess the biggest challenge right now is realizing that I'm growing up. Not getting old mentally or anything like that.. just growing up and maturing into the woman God wants me to be. Its a hard transition but it gets easier as time goes on. I don't have the same worries or cares as people younger than me or even around my age (i.e. boys, parties, school - even though I'm in school, work, etc.). I don't care about any of that. All I want is the next thing God has for me. 

I am excited for marriage, whenever that will happen. God has not only been restoring me as a woman, but he's also been preparing me as a wife. I love my husband right now, even though I don't know who he is yet. I want to love him ""all the days of my life"" (Proverbs 31.12), which means even now. So I am very excited for the day I get to meet him (: Its just another thing that shows how beautiful God is.


So a lot of cool things (: and I know that there will be more. I just love God. I love who he is and everything he's constantly doing for me. He's so wonderful."

<b>I Surrender by Kim Walker</b>

I love this song. I love it because she's talking about giving everything up for God because she realizes how beautiful He is. She realizes that there's nothing better than having Him in every part of her. She'll give up her dreams and her very life for Him because she knows that He is worth it. That He is worth so much more than anything we could every imagine. She knows that once you have a real love encounter with the God of the universe, the God of you and I, that you are never the same. That everything else has a little less color, a little less taste. Nothing else, no matter how good or lovely or exhilarating or beautiful it may be, could <b>ever</b> measure up to the love God has freely and unconditionally given to us.

Once you fall in love with God, <i>everything</i> else changes. You don't want the old stuff. You won't be the old you. Any addiction or struggle or sin fades away because you're constantly and <i>daily</i> battling against them in order to get closer to The King, our True Beloved.

If you're living the same life, in the same bad habits, you aren't in love with God.

It <i>is</i> possible to let all that go. It <i>is</i> possible to surrender everything. The only person making it impossible is yourself.

And God is worth the fight. How much do you love Him? Are you willing to get rid of <b>everything</b> else?

<b>I am.</b>"

<b>--Psalm 114.7</b>

After reading something like chapter 16 in Numbers, how could you <u>not</u> tremble?

God is abundant in love, gracious, merciful and compassionate. Yes, God is all of those things. He's also just, and He is holy. He is the holiest of holies, and He cannot be near sin, He detests it. When we sin, we are separating ourselves from Him, and we cannot be holy as He is holy. When we sin on purpose, we're basically spitting in His face, flipping Him off, cursing Him and trampling on Him. God has a right to get angry with us. If He wanted to, God would have the right to swallow us up with His earth (like He did in Numbers 16). God has done <b>everything</b> for us.. we have no excuse for sinning against Him. NO excuse. 

Fearing God is showing Him reverence and respect. Its living your life in a way that honors Him. Fearing God is also <u>fearing</u> Him, knowing that He has the power over your <u>life and soul</u>. <b>He</b> decides what happens to you. Fearing Him means you know your place and you respect His. He belongs on the throne, being glorified and worshipped for eternity. We belong on our <i>faces</i>, worshipping the Lord our God. Just look at how many times Moses and Aaron fall on their faces before God, they knew their place. They <u>feared</u> God.

He is the potter, we are the clay. We're nothing but mud shaped and molded into who HE wants us to be. We have no place to defy Him. Only a place to worship Him and  give Him everything we are, and give Him all the glory. THAT'S our place.

<b>We belong on our faces.</b>

do not let me be taken from Your garden
hold me,
close and tightly
so he will not be appealing to me.
 
My lover,
he comes to me
by day he woos me
with his wordy eloquence
by night he tries to seduce me.
 
My Beloved,
don't let him come near me
for with him is fear
worry and doubt
beside him is pain, my Lover.
 
I yearn for Your touch
for none other is greater than this
come down, oh Lovely One
come and be with me
for I am lovesick
I long for You in the middle of the night
during the day I search for You.
 
I searched many places,
my Love,
and could not find You.
The world, it grasped me
filled me with its suffocating smoke
its numbing poison
my skin was ruined by its sharp edges
and my mind surrendered to the want of my flesh.
 
Then I looked,
up in the hills,
in the orchards,
I saw the One my heart yearned for,
and You shone in glorious light.
 
Beloved,
I have found the secret place
in Your garden
where You are
where my heart belongs.
So God, take me!
And never let me go
for I am fearful of ever returning
to that hell on earth.
 
Hold me
keep me still
prevent me from shaking
from trembling
oh Love..
I long to love You endlessly,
unconditionally as You do.
 
My God, my Savior, my King
I will serve you forevermore
I will live to desire You
to please You
to gaze upon Your beautiful face
my heart is Yours
my soul, my mind
all of me, God, take it!
Don't let me return to the place of darkness
where Your name is unfamiliar
where Your voice cannot be heard.
 
My Yeshua,
I love you.
Yes. I will sing to You
for I hear You sing over me
we will dance to this secret song
""I am my Beloved's!""
 
Yes, Lord
I am my Beloved's
and He is mine!

If my life isn't being driven by something I'm completely in love with, it becomes dull; mundane and lifeless. Without pursuing something - or someone - that I love, doing anything seems to be done solely for the purpose of doing it. There's no heart behind anything anymore.

This is why I love simply being in love. It doesn't matter with what or with whom.. What matters is the passion and commitment of being in love, period.

Send me something, someone to be in love with, God. Give me the drive to pursue it whole - heartedly, with pure and raw passion.

I want to fall in love..

to taste their red hot trails.
I want to fall so deep
into the black holes of passion.
To fly higher than hope's rockets
to go into the deepest of oceans,

and it willingly pursues the unknown.
True love holds on tightly
to the hand of uncertainty
and jumps, with arms raised high,
into the waters of total surrender.
Hope and trust, are love's close companions
and in the end, commitment rules over emotion.
There are no limits on true love
for all of its actions are unconditional.
True love takes all courage
a lot of heart and genuine patience.
In the masterpiece of it all,
perfect love conquers all things
and nothing can stand against it."

"event","Forgive me God.. because the way I've been living, I've been withholding your love from everyone.. Here's how I go about things:

Fellow christians are my only friends in this world. Not the fake, ""feel good"" christians that come together in their huge, rich churches though. No, those christians are my enemies. They are leading people astray, causing them to turn their backs completely against you, God.

Also, the christians who smoke cigarettes or cuss every now and then. You know, the ones who mess up in any way, completely going against what your holy word says, those are my enemies too. All they're doing is confusing everyone and defiling the faith.

But then there's the non-christians. With them, it's just war, because these people are the ultimate enemies of ""true christians"". They hate you, God. They hate anything good, pure, lovely, right or true. Their only purpose in life is to bring havoc and destruction. They could care less about the well being of their fellow brother..

And then there's my church, The Refuge. Now these are the good people. These people, I'd do anything for, and give everything to. These people are my family, my true family, God. I know that they'll always be there for me. I know they'll let me be who I really am, deep down. I feel comfortable being myself when I'm with them.
...Except, when I'm mad, and so I cuss. I wouldn't do that in front of them because that would be disrespectful. But besides that, I'm pretty comfortable around them.
...Except, when I'm not doing so well. When I've sinned or my mind is doubting or I'm just sick of the whole church scene. When I don't feel like worshipping during service or following along in my bible. When I don't want to show up at all because I'd feel like I'd be hiding myself from you, since I'm not in the right place to enter into your holy place..

Besides all of that, I feel pretty comfortable around them. You know, when I'm in a really good place and all I want to do is just worship and serve you. That's the place I'm definitely willing to share with my family there, God. Because my strength and ""genuine love"" is inspiring, Lord. I mean it has to be. That's why when I'm in a bad place, I just ""fight"" through it. Cuz I know that once I do, people will truly see how much I love you, God. Because I have the strength to push on even when times get tough. And that's inspiring!

So that's why, everyone at The Refuge, that's why they're my real friends. That's why I'd do anything for only them. Because I can be me when I'm around them. But everyone else, God, they're my enemies. They clearly hate you and everything you stand for. So I won't even hang out with those people, just to show my love for you, God. I won't enjoy being around them if I have to be. I'll be short with them, I won't look them in the eye.. because they're wrong, God. And I, well I am clearly right. And it's very clear that I should live my life to make sure everyone knows that. That ME and MY church have all of the answers, but theirs God, theirs doesn't. THEY don't know anything, God. So I shouldn't ""drain"" myself with loving them when MY church needs MY love more. Because MY church comes first, obviously..

...

For everything I just wrote, Jesus Christ, I beg for your forgiveness. Because there is not one word I just wrote that expresses what it means to genuinely, to unconditionally LOVE people. And God, even though I've convinced myself that I have been, I have not been loving anyone genuinely and unconditionally. For that, I am so sorry..

Right now, Jesus Christ, I pray that you change ME. I don't ever want to make someone else feel like they have to change who they are just to deserve my love..

Instead, change me.. because with the way I've been acting, it's me who doesn't deserve your love.."

Life is like watching a good sunset.. you can either waste your time trying to get the best picture all while missing it, or you can just sit there.. in total awe and wonder, and enjoy each and every second of it.
...

Tonight's sunset was amazing.. Not just because it was beautiful to watch, but because it was the inspiration for yet another big decision for me and my life.

There I was, standing in the middle of Sunset Park in rough grass tall enough to reach my knees, watching one of the most gorgeous sunsets I've seen this summer. The coolest part was that I wasn't enjoying this magnificence alone, there were other people.. some couples, a father and his son, a man sitting in his lawn chair, others watching from their cars.. and they were all enjoying the same exact sunset along with me. This very same thing has happened to me one other time. It's quite a feeling, standing there with five to ten other people at the very least, all brought there together because of one, beautiful thing.. and we're all there to just simply enjoy it, together. No one knows anyone else. No one knows another's background, history or beliefs. No one knows anything about anyone else there.. but no one cares, either. All we need to know is that we're all here to watch God's creative side revealed at its best. And that is all that matters.

Who knew that this ONE sunset out of the hundreds I've seen would be the one that would mean the most to me so far.

I realized tonight that I'm missing out on a completely wonderful, lovely and beautiful relationship with God. I let the way other people feel dictate every decision I make. I have no spine; no backbone. I can't make decisions based on my own needs, wants and desires. I don't have the boldness to do such things.. but that doesn't mean I never will.

Things are gonna change, starting tonight. At least I seriously hope so.. I really do. I wanna enjoy life in all its complexities and simplicities.. start enjoying the little things again.. ""noticing the unnoticed"". I want to LOVE everyone I come into contact with.. whatever that may entail. If it means confronting, correcting, confessing, being there, being vulnerable, simply listening.. I want to know the best way to act in any situation. To have the discernment and wisdom to do that, and then to act when I know I need to. I don't want anyone I meet to feel unvalued or unworthy of love, of my love. I want everyone to be my friend, and I want to be a good friend.

I want to go further than I have ever gone before with my God.. I want to start really getting to know him, learning who he is. I want him to be an active role in everything I do. I want to recognize that he is. I want to pursue him with my whole heart, with everything I have, everything I am. I want this because I want God.. I want to be with him, I want to be like him. I want to enjoy him and this life he's blessed me with.

I want all of these wants to be REALITIES..

"event","Last night and today, I felt like this. I keep trying to be so ""young at heart"" and ""carefree"" that being those things start feeling almost forced. I think it's okay to be ""forever young"" and such.. but only if it's genuine. This can only happen if you're receiving the ultimate innocence, the kind you can only get through God.

I keep trying to <u>feel</u> this innocence by acting immature and staying up way past my bedtime in order to ensure that I don't ""miss any fun"". I feel like, though, that God wants me to be <b>innocent</b>. Not immature, not young, necessarily, but innocent. He wants me to always be seeking him with my big, blue, wondrous eyes and my enormous and tender as flesh, heart. He wants me to seek him in every part of my life so that I will always be learning something new about him.

Every time I learn something new about God and his love, I realize that I really don't know much about him at all. AND THAT IS THE POINT. I will never have God ""figured out"". He knows that, I know that, and he knows that I know that. I do. God is so BIG that there is no way <i>anyone</i> could EVER have him figured out!

Maybe life isn't about growing older and more mature. Maybe it's not even about figuring out how to stay ""young at heart forever"".

Maybe life is truly is all about seeking God's heart with all of <b>your</b> heart.


Because honestly, that's where all good things dwell.. <u>in</u> <u>God's</u> <u>heart</u>.

"event","I feel lonely. Not to be confused with ""alone"".. ""Lonely"" is when you <i>feel</i> like no one is there. ""Alone"" is when there <i>isn't</i> anyone there. No, I know I'm not alone. I have an amazing God to thank for that. He's there with me through it all. Nah, I'm lonely, I'm lonely for sure. It's like I crave companionship. I crave being with people. I crave being loved and cared for. And, I crave being physically <i>wanted</i>. Anyway, all of these cravings really become annoying and get in the way all the time. And I always think that creating new relationships or even changing who I am will help. But nothing ever helps. This will all tie into what I <u>don't want</u>. See because, what I want is for my heart to be completely satisfied. I want to feel wanted, needed, and loved. I want to feel beautiful, and useful. I want a lover. A lover who looks into each of the details in my eyes because there's so much depth to me. A lover who is captivated by my love and beauty. A lover who simply cannot get enough of me.. <b>That</b>, is what I want. And with all of these wants, I just sort of expect them to come in a ""tall, handsome, God-loving and wonderful future husband"" package. THIS is where things start going amiss.

Looking at all of my wants, I think it is safe to say that they truly are my heart's desires. I long for every single one of these desires to be fulfilled. I'm just waiting for my Prince Charming to come and fulfill them. Well, that right there is issue number uno. I'm waiting for another <i>human being</i> to come and satisfy the very delicate, very fragile desires of my heart. All humans are screwed up. None of us are perfect, I keep forgetting that. Although I believe that there is a man who will fit who I am and <i>help</i> satisfy my desires.. I also know that he will never be able to <b>completely</b> satisfy them. No, there's only one man who can do that, and his name is Jesus Christ.

How this all ties into ""I want what I really don't want"" is easy. I want my heart's desires to be fulfilled, but I keep thinking that that's going to happen through my future husband. That he will be the one who, somehow, completely breaks any chain of loneliness I hold. The truth of the matter is this, I don't really want (in this case) a husband. No, according to what my heart has been telling me, what I actually <b>want</b>, is God. He's the only one who will forever satisfy me.

A husband will HELP in breaking my loneliness by simply being there to share in our experiences together. He will help fix me, but he can't do it on his own. It's kind of like God fills half of me and allows my husband to fill the other half. But our duty for each other (me and my husband) is to share life and experience it, and God, <b>together</b>.

I mean, even <i>Adam</i> who experienced God's pure and holy love without any chain of sin bonding him.. even <i>he</i> wanted another human companion to share it with.


That's the only thing I should really be expecting or looking for in a future husband.. the ability to experience life and God's love for us with him, and then being able share it together."

Sometimes I get this weird, out of nowhere feeling that I should still be that person. The person who made mistakes for a living. That lost, broken and confused person. The one who never knew what she was doing, but would never shy away from anything because she was scared. Even though that person sucks, sometimes I miss her.

I dunno. Maybe its because its May, and its still cold outside. Something's just off, you know? Something is wrong with this picture. Just like the picture of a cold May is wrong. Maybe its because of the music I'm listening to right now. Serious, music has such an odd effect on me. It always has. Maybe its because I'm Jessica, and I get bored a lot. Sometimes I get so bored with who I am or what my life is like that I just wanna go and change everything. I don't know. Maybe its because I seem to <i>always</i> get into these places and never know why, exactly.


I guess what I'm saying is that I am still a screwup who needs help, and a lot of it. I can't pretend I'm not feeling what I feel, so I let myself feel them.

"event","I know God's got me covered. I know he's the only one I can place my hope, trust, and faith in. I know he's gonna take care of me. But most importantly, I know that my Jesus <i>loves</i> me. Every day, it seems, I learn something new and unfathomable about his love for me. He drives me crazy.. (': Tonight, he showed me his love through the story of Judas, portrayed in a play my brother was in.

The play mostly took place in the courtroom during Judas' trial, but I hardly cared for that. The parts of the play that really hit me were the parts when the audience got to really experience the life of Judas. A normal boy, no better than myself, or anyone for that matter. Judas later on becomes one of Jesus' appointed apostles who (as shown in the play) was one of his favorites. He brought something unique to the group. He challenged Jesus Christ himself.. which only made his love for Judas all the more deep. But overall, no matter how he acted or what he said, his faith in Jesus was genuine. I know this is all only a play and hardly any of it biblical, but I like the idea and how it reveals the relationship between God and all of humanity. 

In the play, after Judas betrayed Jesus, you see him begging Pilot to take his money and set Jesus free. Because really, he knew Jesus was innocent. Later you see Judas in a bar talking to satan. He's completely distressed and extremely afraid because he realizes that his chances of being saved from going to hell are slim to none. During the duration of the play, Judas sits on the side of the stage, completely paralyzed from his act of betrayal and with no one able to get through to him. As if all of that wasn't heartbreaking enough, the end of the play was yet to come. This was the scene that really got to me. The very last scene of this high school production was what showed me an aspect of God's love I've never completely understood before.

Jesus goes to Judas after finishing a monologue about how he's by <u>everyone's</u> side, even the worst of us. He sits down by Judas and tries to comfort him, but Judas fiercely refuses and tells Jesus to back away. Jesus complies, but continues to tell Judas that all of his misery, and guilt, and oppression can be gone if he only lets Jesus <b>love</b> him. That's all Jesus wants, is for Judas to simply accept his love. He tells Judas that a crowd could spit on him and he wouldn't care but he can not let someone he was so close to go on like this. The scene gets more intense as Judas screams at Jesus, asking why he left him, and demanding answers. But by now, Judas can't hear the truth, that Jesus never left him, and that he loves him. Judas spits on Jesus and tells him to leave. Jesus tells Judas to take his hands (this is the part I remember vividly).. and Judas cries, ""Where are they?! I can't see them!!"" Jesus says, ""They're right here."" But Judas can't see, and he screams and keeps denying Jesus' efforts to love him. Jesus yells, ""Judas! Just love me back.."" But Judas is paralyzed again. Completely gone, and Jesus leaves. 

After you find out that Judas has been found guilty, Jesus re-enters the stage and ends the play by washing Judas' feet. Even after being betrayed, being denied over and over.. and even after Jesus lost Judas' soul, his love for him stayed the same.

THAT'S what I learned about God's love for <i>me</i> through this play. I don't know who to feel more heartbroken for.. a man who denies God's love until he can no longer accept it, ever, or The God who loves everyone perfectly who has to witness such a heart-wrenching thing, <b>more than once.</b>

So as I was saying earlier.. I know all of God's promises for me, but what I really took from tonight is that God loves me, <u>no matter what</u>, and THAT'S ALL.

I hope I can help Jesus make sure he never has to see something like what happened to Judas, <u>ever again.</u>"

I see the few people who still care about others being used, being walked on, and being broken because no one feels that they too, need care. I see people who are loved and cared for completely disregard it and focus on their own bitterness and insecurities and lack of love for themselves. I see people giving up on love right and left because they've been burned one too many times. I see people who play peacemaker among divided relationships and end up getting the worst of it all. I see everyone searching for some kind of love but no one understands that <i>we all</i> need it. It's like that quote, I don't remember how it goes exactly but it's like, ""Go easy on people, they may be going through a rough time."" Or, ""Hurting people, hurt people."" If everyone knew that <b>everyone</b> needs love, I wonder how differently we'd act towards each other.

Lastly, I see the One who is Love being heartbroken because it seems like everyone is so lost.

"event","For more than a year now, I have heard people say, ""We don't call ourselves christians, the name has been perverted and distorted into something we don't believe. Instead we call ourselves.. (enter personal label here)."" When people said this to me, I liked it. I liked finding out who Christ really was instead of who most christians today have made him out to be. I too, told others I don't call myself a christian but I do love Christ and follow him. Christianity has been given a bad name by no one else but christians themselves. Believers today have decided to solve this problem by creating a new label, ""Christ follower"" or ""Jesus freak"" etc.

Last night during my date night this is what God said to me, ""Its not about changing, it's about renewing."" Maybe christianity is heard now as something it isn't, but that is <i>our</i> doing. Like every other human being, running away (or in this case, creating a new label) is the answer. Now that we have a new name, we can show the world who we <b>really</b> are. But last night I realized that changing our name is a meaningless thing to do. What happens if Christ Followers mess up? Then do we change our name to The New and Improved Christ Followers? ""It's not about changing.."" our name, ""..it's about renewing"" the one we already have. It's about taking the name ""christian"" and showing the world what that is. It's about taking pride, saying, ""I am a <b>Christ</b>ian, I believe in Christ and I follow him."" It's about living of life a love, saying the name of Christ everywhere we go so that people will look at our actions, and hear the name of Christ at the same time.

And really, what we're labeled doesn't matter at all. Standing up for the very name of Jesus and living the way he wanted us to live is what truly makes the difference. It's all about glorifying Jesus Christ, and spreading his name with our mouths and spreading his love through our actions.

<b>I am a christian, and that means I try my best to live a life of loving God and loving people, since that is what the gospels of Christ tell me to do.</b>"

My dad was saved at that same church and he, my mom, and the whole church prayed that their next baby would be a girl. I was born, and named Jessica which means, ""Grace of God"" because (as my dad explained), ""it was by the grace of God that he gave us you, a girl.""

When I was three, my family left the church my dad was saved in and started attending a Messianic church. I grew up in this church. I knew who God was, and I knew who Jesus was and what he came here to do, but his purpose on earth didn't hit me until years later.

My family grew up knowing another family, the Smiths, and we were all really close friends with all of them. The Smith's went to AWANA, which is basically a youth group for kids of any age. Because we were so close with them, my brothers (and now) sister and I all started going too. I was going for awhile, but it was pretty much so I could hang out with my best friend at the time, Abby. 

One night at AWANA, our teacher was telling all the girls in my grade about the story of the woman who lost one of her silver coins (Luke 15:8-10). Our teacher was telling us that the woman swept her whole house clean, that she looked <i>everywhere</i> just to find this one coin. Finally, she did and she gathered her friends and neighbors together to celebrate the fact that she had found this <i>one</i> coin. Our teacher then proceeded to say that we are God's ""lost coin"", and that when he finds us, he also rejoices and celebrates just because he found us. Just because he found <b>me</b>. The teacher then told us all to close our eyes and raise our hands if we wanted to ask Jesus into our life. I remember I made sure no one was looking before I closed my eyes then raised my hand. The teacher prayed over us all, but I didn't know what I personally had to do to get Jesus in my heart.

That night, I sat in my bed crying. I wasn't sad or anything, I just wanted Jesus. I waited for my dad to come in to say goodnight so I could ask him to help me get Jesus. When he came in, I asked him and he had me repeat a prayer that he used to help my older brothers, too. I remember as I repeated each word, I believed them with all of my heart. I was <i>flying</i> that night. I could not stop smiling and felt as though my heart was lifted and was soaring around in pure happiness. So, on September 21, 1999, I decided to give my life to Christ. 

I've been extremely fortunate in my life. I have no stories of my mom beating me or my dad leaving our family. I didn't grow up with drugs or alcohol. I've had a really blessed life which I am thankful for. I didn't have really any hardships until I started high school. Over the four years that I attended, I learned more about God and myself than I ever thought possible.

Me and Abby had stopped being best friends when we both went to high school. She went a year before me and got really into the party scene. I talked to her a couple times about it, but she didn't want to change, and neither did I, so we kinda stopped speaking with each other, and I no longer had a best friend.

My three older brothers, my younger brother, younger sister and myself, were all home schooled until high school. My parents gave us each the choice to either go to a public school or stay at home for our schooling. I, like my older brothers, decided I wanted to go to public school.

The transition for home life to public school life wasn't too hard except for the fact that I didn't have a lot of friends. I was nervous going in that I wouldn't have any friends during my whole high school experience. Finding friends wasn't the hard part, fitting in with them was.

Freshman and sophomore year consisted of me and my two goals: Become popular and get a boyfriend. My whole life was wrapped around these two things. I made sure I dressed the part, looked the part, and got in with the right people. I had a couple good friends, but I blew them off to become best friends with Jeilynne, who was popular. I pretty much used her to ""make my name known"" with all of her friends. I figured by hanging out with her, I would eventually get a boyfriend and be popular.

Freshman year was coming to an end and I was still single and still not popular, I used the summer before sophomore year to try even harder. I started getting really into trends and what magazines told me girls should look like. I still had God, but he was completely off my priorities list. I didn't care what he thought about me, I cared what boys and popular kids thought about me. That summer me, Jeilynne and our two best friends Alex and Erin got really close. The four of us hung out all the time. We all started hanging with some other kids that Alex and Erin knew, and all of us got pretty close as well. Goal one was complete, I was popular. I also found out Erin had a crush on me. I liked him too, but I was too shy to say anything.

An old friend of mine, Amy, invited me to her youth group one night. I had still been going to church, but I didn't have any christian friends, so I decided to go. I really liked her youth group. They were all really funny and super nice. The first few times I went were the only times Amy invited me. Then I decided to start going on my own, every week.

The summer before sophomore year, the youth group went to a camp called Student Life Camp. There I had figured out that I had been putting popularity before anything else in my life, especially God. I wanted to give him my want for popularity, I wanted it to not matter to me anymore, but it still did. Then sophomore year started.

Because I never gave Erin any hints, and because Jeilynne did, Erin decided to ask Jeilynne out and she said yes. It sucked, but I didn't want it to get to me. I figured Jeilynne would break his heart, and then I could date him. But while they started dating, I saw less of both of them, and then less of Alex. The four of us were no longer as close as we were during the summer.

The whole group including Alex and Erin all decided that smoking pot and drinking was fun. They kept having all these parties that (because I wasn't close to Alex and Erin anymore) I wasn't invited to. I was really sad. It wasn't that I necessarily wanted to get drunk or high, but I did want to fit in. I would've done <i>anything</i> to make me feel like I did. I dropped hints about not being invited and tried to show that I would have fun at those kinds of parties too. No one got my hints and they all kinda left me in their dust. I had lost every single friend I had sophomore year. I was lonely, I was becoming depressed, and all I could think about was the fact that I wasn't good enough. I felt stupid. I felt ugly. I felt alone.

Summer came, and I was relieved. I felt safe at my youth group. I no longer felt alone. I was glad to leave school because I had no friends anymore. This was the summer that I decided when I go back to school, I would no longer care about boys and popularity. If I still had no friends when I went back I could care less. I told God that he would be my only friend, and that finally, I was okay with that. This was the summer that me and God actually started getting close.

That summer me and a guy from my youth group, Tommy, started getting really close. Soon we were talking every night over AIM for hours. We would talk about literally everything. Tommy knew more about me than anyone else. I soon developed a crush on Tommy, and he liked me too. When we finally told each other, I was thrilled. I would finally have a boyfriend, and an awesome one at that. But the next night when I asked Tommy where we were gonna go in our relationship, he told me he didn't like me enough to date me. I was crushed, and feelings of being not good enough set in even harder than before. I went on a missions trip to Utah and used it as a break from Tommy. Our relationship had completely vanished. He didn't talk to me anymore, not like he used to. So not only did he break my heart, but he also left my life. Because I was sad about Tommy and not feeling good enough for any guy, or really anyone because so many people kept leaving, I started cutting myself.

During first semester of junior year, I remembered my promise to God, that he would be my only best friend. I decided to keep that promise and I was happier than I have ever been in my life, even now. I came back to school completely refreshed. Any good thing that happened to me, I blamed on God. Any bad thing, I blamed on life. I was carefree. I was genuinely happy. I guess people saw that in me, because immediately guys started noticing me and people wanted to be friends with me. I kept thanking God over and over because I knew all this attention from people was a blessing from him. I got my first boyfriend that year, but we only dated a couple days because all he wanted from me was to make out. Then I met Cody, who literally swept me off my feet.

Cody had hung out with me and my best friends at the time, Jake and Andrea. He was telling me and Jake one day that he really wanted to go to prom (he was a sophomore). I told him he could be my date, because I didn't have one, and he agreed. I liked Cody, but I never let him know it. I was still insecure about telling guys how I felt because of the whole Tommy thing. Turns out he had feelings for me too because at prom, I had my very first kiss with him. About a week later, he and I started dating, and I couldn't have been happier. We dated for the whole summer. We just enjoyed life and each other. Everything was perfect. I went to Utah a second time with my youth group, and when I came back, everything was different. He started acting weird about a week after I came home. He didn't talk to me as much, and he never wanted to hang out. I knew he wanted to break up with me, but I wasn't going to quit until he said so. I didn't even see him until we returned to school. Even when I did, it was like we weren't even dating. 

Cody had told me about this girl he used to have a weird thing with, Joy. He kept telling me that she was in love with him still and wanted him to date her. I felt bad for her, but I also didn't like her (for obvious reasons). One day, my brother invited her to our youth group, and the two of us really hit it off.

Right before my senior year started, Joy and I were hanging out every day. I never saw Cody, and she was still in love with him. So we used each other to hurt ourselves over the same boy. I stopped eating, started smoking (because Joy did), and drank way too much coffee. I was losing weight, but I no longer had an appetite. Joy had a best friend at the time, Maggie, and the three of us hung out all the time.

It wasn't until a month after senior year started that Cody and I finally broke up. I didn't want to let go, but he would never notice me. When he saw me, he gave me these half hugs. All we ever said to each other was ""hey."" One day I texted him and told him that if he was done, I wanted him to say so. So he did, the next day, and it sucked.

After that, things kept going downhill. Everyone had made me feel like because of my faith, I wasn't good enough. So I decided to prove them all wrong, and started rebelling against God himself. Not only was I depressed, but I was literally <i>gone</i>. Who I was vanished along with my relationship with God (although I didn't see it at the time). I was cutting again, and a lot. I burned myself too. Anything that could cause more pain, I did. I became numb inside, and nothing moved me. The only place my mind was at was death. I wanted to die every single day. And all I thought about was how easy it would be to kill myself. I could cut hard enough, smoke too much, drink too much (I had been drinking myself to sleep every night), or get into a car accident, only on purpose. I wasn't eating. I wasn't sleeping. I could care less about myself or anyone around me. I was pretty much just waiting for the day I finally killed myself. And I didn't know it, but I <i>was</i> killing myself every day.

I lost every single good relationship I had. With my friends, with my church, and with my family. I stopped going to church and to youth group.  I was pissed at God, and pissed in general. I didn't want to have anything to do with God anymore. All I wanted was to die. I was getting into worse and worse places. I smoked pot for the first time ever and got in a huge fight with my parents about it. I kept drinking, I smoked so many cigarettes that I threw up. My life had been drained to completely nothing.

One day when I was home (I was never home) my littlest sisters told me they missed seeing me at the dinner table. They said the house wasn't the same without me there. I don't know why <i>this</i> comment got to me, but it did. It made me see how much I was affecting my family by my selfish behavior. I wanted to change, but at this point I had no idea how. My church, I found out, was going to a conference in Kansas City. I didn't go to their youth group or anything, I wasn't even going to church. But for some reason, even if it was just to get away from my current life, I wanted to go.

God completely wrecked me at this conference. He helped me see exactly what I had done to every single relationship in my life. He helped me see how far from him I was and how different from me I really was. He basically told me that this is my chance to change my life for good, otherwise he would no longer try with me. I was given the choice to accept and embrace God's love, or reject it for good. I decided I wanted God, which meant my life would need some major changes.

When I came home, I cut contact with the only two friends I had. I started trying to rebuild old ones and create new ones. I started going to my church's youth group because the other one I went to since I started high school had shunned me because of everything I did senior year. It wasn't until I finally decided to go to my friend Britt's youth group that my life started changing dramatically.

Since I've gone to the Refuge, God has broken every addiction and wall I placed in my own life. My relationship with him is a constant clinging onto him only. I am beautifully broken. I am in love. God is literally all I have. I am the epitome of the prodigal son. I am God's ""lost coin"". He's found me. It hasn't been an easy process to be who I am right now from who I was senior year, but it has been completely worth it. God has taken away <i>everything</i> since I told him he could. But I would never ask for a thing back. He constantly shows himself to me and I am never bored with what new things I learn from him. I still have my flaws, I'm still human, I still mess up. But I have a real relationship with my God that no one can take away. I have a God who's in love with me and wants me to have the absolute best. I have a God that even while I was purposely rebelling against him, was still trying to win my attention, and finally got it. My God is <b>my</b> God, and never again will that mean nothing to me.

All during high school I was shown one thing by people, you can't trust them. I've been left by so many people I was close to that I became bitter against them. It has been a continuing journey with God who shows me that I don't need to trust people, I only need to love them. God has given me personally a mission, and that is to love people no matter how much it hurts. I've taken this mission to the extreme, and I've also blown it off because of my past hurts. But God shows me every day that he is here to take my pain. Maybe loving people hurts, maybe it's scary, but God takes my fears and hurts upon himself. God is my help and my refuge. Without him I couldn't do anything. Without him, I would be nothing. I honestly believe that if I didn't have God, I would've followed through my threats and would have actually killed myself senior year. God not only saved my life when he died for me 2,000 years ago, but he continues to save my life now, every day.

Now I'm at a place where I won't let anyone stand between me and God. He's the only one I can count on, so he's the one that should mean the most to me. He's the only one I believe when he says, ""I love you."" and ""you can trust me."" And no one else holds that power. I depend on God for everything. Even though I mess up.. a lot, ha, God still calls me his own.

I'm my Beloved's, and he is mine. And he has shown me that I <b>need</b> him more than I need anything else."

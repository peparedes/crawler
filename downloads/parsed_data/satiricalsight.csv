"event","Life is insane. I have no time, no sleep. But this is what I love. 

This is it for me, and I think I've realized that. I'm fighting for something I truly believe in, and when that battle's won, I'm on to the next. I've found a place that can harbor my competitive nature, cultivate it, let my ambition and drive work in my favor, and help me to excell.  

So many people tell me to ""slow down and live my college years""... don't they get it? I AM! What better way to live college than finding your direction and pursuing it. I suppose I don't get drunk 4 nights out of the week and attend sorority socials and parties, but I'm happier. I still have fun, just with political people.  

They tell me I'm ""so ahead of the game"" and look shocked when I say how old I am. Perhaps that's what I revel in, what I live for... their shock. Like, ""F you... thought a woman couldn't do this? A 19 year old woman at that?"" I love proving them all wrong, and I slowly am. Especially with College Republicans. Things are coming together, and those who opposed me are finally seeing that I am capable of doing this. Every once in awhile I get an email from someone who wasn't exactly supportive in April saying that they appreciate my leadership style and what I've done for the club. That's what I do it for. I love the pressure, I love the competition.... it fuels my drive. I love proving them all wrong. 

Here's pictures of College Republicans... updated pretty frequently. We should have pics from the KICKASS Michael Moore Pro-America rally here soon. That was one of the most amazing nights of my life... it truly cemented my love for this. The ability to stand outside Ruby Diamond with 200 College Republicans and stand for what we believed in... that was truly amazing.

On another note, I met a guy. I'm slighty giddy this morning. Mainly because he's not from my circle of Republican friends... he's not political at all, really. Though he is a little old. NOt like, 40 old or anything, just not exactly my age. But guys my age aren't into me... and if they are, they get weird. I had some shmuck at a bar the other night say I'm ""too much for a younger guy to handle"". Now what the hell is that supposed to mean? Am I a zoo animal? Do I need a muzzle and a whip? Come on, there's much more aggressive women out there than me. :)

Anyways, we'll see what happens with him. Not that I have time. I have absolutely NO time for a social life. NOVEMBER 3RD, BABY!

I love you all, and for those of you I don't see anymore, I'm really sorry. I wish I could explain or somehow portray to you what my life is like now. I don't want to blame it all on being ""busy""... I hate that excuse. But life is insane. All I really think about is the campaign and College Republicans. I guess I'm just... mentally preoccupied. 

Take Care, all!"

Geiger was at Harry, and.... I TOLD HIM THAT I LIKED HIM LAST YEAR!!! AAAAHHHHHHH! (Needless to say, this was after 2 cups of that Harry crap).  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I'm such an idiot.  He was like, totally amazed, and was like ""Oh my god, that's awesome""... and then tried to make out with me. I was like, ""wait, no... that was LAST year..."" heh heh and kept pushing him away. Very funny.

Just thought you should know! 

Not even going to bother posting on my life, though it is hilarious how NOT indicative of my life this entire account is. Oh well, that means I can look back on this time during my second year of college and think that I was partying and acting like a normal college student... heh heh... yeah right."

"event","So I did it. I went there... to Athens, to see Perfect College Republian Man. God, was I stressed about it... and so excited. I really did look forward to it.

And all in all... well, I still don't even know what to think. I'm so back and forth. Well, first off... I'm glad I went. Period. I really and truly am. It was a good thing to do, so I will never look back and wonder, ""what if"".  I also forced myself to burst this little bubble of perfection that he was existing in. 

Why is he not perfect anymore, you ask? Well... several reasons. He really laid on the charm the first night (friday night) and I really was psyched, thinking that this was going to be a great weekend. He took me to a really nice restaurant, and to Marble Slab, and we walked around UGA, which was beautiful. The conversation was AMAZING. We connected intellectually and politically, and I really learned so much from what he had to say. So great. Well... I think the charm wore off on Saturday, because he got in this quiet mood while we were hanging out, and he just didn't say much. This made my insecurities run RAMPANT, causing me to stress a little, and probably making me read too much into everything, but hey... I'm a chick. But still, I played it cool. We played some football, hung out, went to see ""Troy""... but his charm seemed to have wore off, which made me feel kind of used. He didn't hold my hand or act affectionate in public, not even in the movie theater, which was a little surreal. Then on Saturday night we watched the Chapelle show (which I don't even like that much) while he played a game on his cell and occasionally took ""very important"" cell phone calls in another room. Sounds like a jerk, doesn't he? 

And I guess that's where I run into a problem. He does kind of SOUND like one when I write it all out like that... but I don't really think he is. And the time I had where he WASN'T  a jerk, I really and truly enjoyed. I mean, we laid in bed for hours and talked about history with Fox News in the background. We had so much in common, and a majority of the time he was really nice and respectful. When I brought up a concern about his actions, he would profusely apologize and say that he just ""doesn't think about those things"" and he would implore me ""not to read too much into it"".  So this leaves me in a spot. 

Also, I hate to post about this, but it has to be mentioned. For those of you who know me, you know how .... reluctant... I am to be ... physical... with a guy. I mean... a certain kind of physical. OH, god, forget the fancy language... I didn't want to have sex with him, and I told him that up front. I know him, but not well enough, and I'm just not that way. It just doesn't happen like that for me, and it never will. I explained this to him pretty early on in the visit, and he was totally cool about it, until... later. In the ""heat of the moment""... he got a little pushy, and I felt like he was inwardly laughing at me for my principles... like I was just a little girl. He didn't force me into anything, but he essentially begged for it, thinking he could try to sway me, I guess. But then I wonder... what kind of guy would want sex that he had to beg a girl into, knowing that she wasn't totally comftorble with it in the first place? Hmmm... Needless to say, nothing happened. :) 

So, there it is. He is no longer perfect, and I don't know what's next. I want to invite him down here ... just to see what happens, but I'm a little apprehensive. Should I just try to forget about those amazing moments of intellectual and emotional connection and just walk away, knowing that I'm saving myself pain? Or shoudl I throw caution to the wind and think with my heart? He had his assholish moments this weekend that really pissed me off... but does that mean that I should throw it all away? 

Uhh... there's never a perfect balance. Finally I find a man with some drive and ambition and political intelligence, and I'm stuck between walking away and sticking around... 

What do you guys think?"

"event","I have 4 less teeth in my mouth as of yesterday. It really was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. They totally put me under, so I don't remember a thing about it. I VAGUELY remember them waking me up and saying that it was time to go home, and I argued with them saying ""no way, it can't be... I don't remember"".. although with the gauze in my mouth, it most likely sounded like ""nowaaa, tcaneee... I font reeeemer"".  My mom even said that I said ""no shit"" when they told me it was all over. Oops. lol.

So I spent the majority of yesterday sleeping.  Felt like such a bum.  Slept from, like, 10 am till about 4 , then woke up and piddled around. I look like  demon chipmunk. Or at least that's how I feel I look. My cheeks are puffed up like I'm storing a whole ARSENAL of nuts for the winter. They gave me some pain medicine.... of which I took two last night. My apologies to anyone who spoke to me around 11pm last night... haha. 

Ok, so pre-operation I finally talked to Perfect CR man. See, the story was that he was alll serious for awhile, telling me that I should come up and visit him, and that he was really interested, yadda yadda yadda. Then, he doesn't call. Like, he pulled the whole ""I'll call you this weekend""... and then monday, tuesday, wednesday, NOTHING. So, I decide that I'm totally better than this... which I am, and I called him (after he pulled this TWICE) and layed down the law. I told him that if he wasn't interested, he didnt' need to play games with me, that I was better than that, if he just wanted to be friends, it would be just fine, that if he wanted to pursue something, basically he needed to shape up and get with it. Amazingly, it worked. (I had been sweet and nice Kirsten for long enough, it was time to pull out the big guns... what did I have to lose?) Anyways, he offered sincerest apologies, of course used the whole ""I've been soooo busy"" excuse, (haha), and asked for ""a second chance"".  More apologies and explanations, and then he actually said that he thought I was one of the ""coolest girls he ever met, and that he really could see a 'future' with me"". The 'f' word kind of freaked me out, but oh well... we can forget about that. So, to make a long story as short as possible to spare you all, I am going to go visit him in Athens (Georgia) in two weeks.  

The only thing that was worrying me as we were getting off of our 1 1/2 long phone call the other night that he WASN'T going to change, and he was going to not call again like he had before. I mean, come on, its just his way. First of all, he's a guy, and second of all, he even admitted it... he's not very good at this calling stuff. Buuuuuttttt.... I checked my email today, and there was an email from him. Very surprising. He just wanted to check on me and see how I was doing, and said he would give me a call later on. Hmmm... perhaps you can teach a man, right? 

So there it is. I try not to post about romantic interests in LJ, but... this one is different. He's.... so... unlike anyone I've ever met. He has plans, and a future, and so many of my same interests. We shall see. As I've written before, ""if nothing else, he gives me hope."" And he does. No more settling for men that don't deserve me. No more settling for little boys in men's bodies.... I'm done."

It's my last night in 407 Gilchrist. I really am starting to feel a little sentimental.  And its funny... I started out the same way I'm leaving. Sara's stuff is packed up, and its just me, at my desk, typing away at my computer. Haha. Sure enough, on Friday August 15th, I wrote ""Well, it is very lonely on the Fourth floor of Gilchrist right now... ""  I remember how I felt that night. So scared, so lonely... So unsure of everything. GOD, I was a totally different person. When I look at where I am now, I feel like I've grown up so much in the past year. Sure, I'm sitting at the same desk, at the same computer, in the same room.... but I'm in a toally different place. Amazing...

I never thought I would be staying in Tally for my first summer away from home. I never thought I would be CHAIRMAN of a group that I was so stoked to even be a part of. Its worked out. It truly has. Someone, somewhere is watching out for me. I have my job here, my life here, my apartment, my friends, and my aspirations. All in a period of less than a year.

I managed to go from being a scared little girl who was away from her boyfriend and her mommy in August to being a woman who doesn't want a boyfriend, has an apartment, a life, a job and way too many titles. (Though perhaps I'm still scared, now that I read that last sentence. haha.) 
I've grown so much. Thank you to all of you who were a part of it. Steph, JACK, the girls at 1522, Chiefs, CR's.. everything. And even to Brent. I even thank those who made this hard, because I think that's what made me grow. 

At the same time I grew below the surface of the ground, I also sprouted up to the sky. I grew stronger, taller, fuller, and my roots grew down into Tallahassee..."

"event","Whew. Well, I haven't updated in awhile, but I thought that tonight would be something that I would want to remember for posterity's sake.  

I ran for College Republican Chair tonight and won! I don't know how or why it happened, but it did, and I'm quite in shock.  I really did not expect to win... or perhaps I did, but it really hadn't sunk in. The election process itself was HORRIBLE, and it was really devisive. I had to see a lot of friends turn against me and vote the other way, which was tough. In the end, the vote came out to be 19 to 16... I only won by a few votes, which is tough, but its still a win.  

I realize now what I've gotten myself into. Not that I didn't want it... I did. I do. But this responsibility is IMMENSE. I can't even begin to describe it.  Just everything that it entails, all the work, the organization, the.... accountability.  No matter what I do next year, there will be people there looking over my shoulder saying ""Matt would have done better""... and that's scary. This will be the time to prove myself... I now realize that this is the biggest responsibility I've ever had. But I will take it head on. Jeez... what was I thinking?? :) 

Hm, what else is new? I think I'm finally absolutely and totally over Brent. I mean, I really don't even think about him anymore. I guess that's kind of sad.  Every once in awhile he does something that he knows will get back to me, and I know that he's doing it just to get to me... That bugs me. But ... it just proves how silly he was to begin with.  I just realize how much I compromised my standards with him, because now I see so many GREAT guys who have so much more of what I want... men who are smart, and political, and funny... I see that what I really want does exist, and that for so long I just settled. Sooner or later I'll have to deal with his memory, and stop pushing him under the rug, but for now, the rug suits him juuuuust fine. 

Ah, speaking of nice men that give me hope... I met one at the College Republican State Convention a few weeks ago.  I'm going to try and refrain from updating too much about guys, because sooner or later I will seem really stupid and boycrazy, but this one is worth it. I think. I hope. ANYWAYS, he is the National College Republican Secretary, was the State Chairman for Georgia, and was the assistant political director to the Governor of Georgia by age 18. How crazy is that? Anyways, we kind of got together over convention, and I really do enjoy his company, and we still talk twice a week or so. I'm not sure where its going, since he does go to UGA, but oh well... if nothing else, he gives me hope.

So, that's all. Mostly this chair position is going to consume me. And my work at the Bush/Cheney campaign. (they might pay me... shhhh! I'm not getting my hopes up, but that's the word on the street) I know it seems like I'm getting really political guys, but its an election year. This opportunity won't come around again for 4 years. 

Oh yeah! For those of you who posted on my LJ about the internship, I have taken it! Thank you all for your advice!!

"event","Ok, so I'm counting on my friends to all respond to this post and tell me what you think I should do.

Here's the situation:

    As many of you know, I worked last summer in Titusville as a swim coach/swim instructor, and totally loved it.  I was asked to be head coach of the team this year, and I was planning on getting a LOT of hours (= lots of money) I was really looking forward to it, because I love that job, although I was bummed about other parts of the situation (ie lack of Tally friends, presence of certain people in tville, lack of bush/cheney campaign) I was excited. I went to the county-wide Head Coaches meeting, and met with my boss about this summer, yadda yadda yadda. 

   Now, as many of you ALSO know, I've been volunteering down at the State Headquarters for the Bush/Cheney campaign, doing whatever needs done.  I usually have a pretty good time, because I love politics (and Bush).  I was in the office last week with the Communications Director (young guy named Albert) when he asks me if I'd be interested in a communications internship.  My major is political science/public relations, and he is essentially the PR person for the entire campaign for Florida.  At first I said, ""no I can't""... but the more people I talk to, the more I start to realize what an amazing opportunity this would be.  I mean, I would be the personal intern/aide to the Communications Director for the whole state... and Florida is suuuch a crucial state this year. This internship would build connections and experience, and lead to many other things.  

   So... which one do I choose?  I love teaching and coaching... absolutely LOVE it. I've already pretty much committed myself to being there, so I would have to let Dee down, and she's been so great to me.  Also, that means I wouldn't go home... I'd just stay here, except for occasional trips home.  The big thing is that this internship is UNPAID. Yeah, you heard me... NO MONEY. I've been spending like I have money coming in this summer... because I thought I would.  I might be able to get a little job on the side to pay rent or whatever. 
 
   At this point I'm still torn, though I'm sort of leaning towards taking the internship, especially after talking to my boss and everything, and hearing what an ""amazing"" opportunity this is, etc.  I really want to go home... but I want to stay here at the same time.   I know you're all going to tell me to ""do what I think is right""... I'm just curious... what would you all do? Choose between what you love, and what is good for you.  

Let me know what you guys think... I value ALL of your opinions.  If you dont have a livejournal, you can still post a response....

Love you all sooo much

"event","Ok, so feeling slightly less empowered today.  Its so up and down. Had an amazing night last night... if you want to know about it, ask! Definately a liberating experience...  

Feel a little funky right now.  I guess everything has its ups and downs.  I'm really hesitant about posting about this on LJ, just because... well... I don't want my feelings about this whole situation to be ""public""... but I do want my friends to know what I'm going through. Interesting predicament.  

So now, to save myself embarassment from past ""friends"" who will possibly tell SOME CERTAIN PEOPLE about how Kirsten is feeling, I shall explain with some more lyrics... I'm empathizing so much with songs recently.  Anybody else ever been through that? Its like you go through something, and then you just turn to certain songs.... 

Well, its not Christina this time.... 

<lj-cut text= ""Leave"">


It's amazing
How you make your face just like a wall
How you take your heart and turn it off
How I turn my head and lose it all

It's unnerving
How just one move puts me by myself
There you go just trusting someone else
Now I know I put us both through hell

I'm not saying there wasn't nothing wrong
I just didn't think you'd ever get tired of me
I'm now saying we ever had the right to hold on
I just didn't wanna let it get away from me

But if that's how it's gonna leave
Straight out from underneath
Then we'll see who's sorry now
If that's how it's gonna stand, when
You know you've been depending on
The one you're leaving now
The one you're leaving out

It's aggravating
How you threw me on and you tore me out
How your good intentions turn to doubt
The way you needed time to sort it out

I'm not saying there wasn't nothing wrong
I just didn't think you'd ever get tired of me
I'm now saying we ever had the right to hold on
I just didn't wanna let it get away from me

But if that's how it's gonna leave
Straight out from underneath
Then we'll see who's sorry now
If that's how it's gonna stand, when
You know you've been depending on
The one you're leaving now
The one you're leaving out

The one you're leaving now
The one you're leaving out

I'm not saying there wasn't nothing wrong
I just didn't think you'd ever get tired of me

But if that's how it's gonna leave
Straight out from underneath
Then we'll see who's sorry now
If that's how it's gonna stand, when
You know you've been depending on
The one you're leaving now
The one you're leaving out

Tell me is that how it's going to end
When you know you've been depending on
The one you're leaving now
And the one you're leaving out

The one you're leaving now
The one you're leaving out"

<lj-cut text=""Fighter"">

After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you
But in the end I want to thank you
Because you made me that much stronger

When I, thought I knew you
Thinking, that you were true
I guess I, I couldn't trust
Called your bluff, time is up
'Cause I've had enough
You were, there by my side
Always, down for the ride
But your, joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mmhmm

After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But, uh uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Never, saw it coming
All of, your backstabbing
Just so, you could cash in
On a good thing before I realized your game
I heard, you're going around
Playing the victim now
But don't, even begin
Feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

After all of the fights and the lies
Yes you wanted to harm me but that won't work anymore
Uh, no more, oh no, it's over
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now, and never back down
So I wanna say thank you

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust so cruel
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see
YOU-WON'T-STOP-ME

I am a fighter and I
I ain't gonna stop
There is no turning back
I've had enough

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighte

though i forget, but i, i remember
i remember, i remember 
though i forget, but i, i remember
i remember, i remember 

'Cause it makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
It makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter"

This week has been crazy.  I have a big walking cast on my leg now because I have achilles tendonitis in my right heel, and they're afraid it could rupture... therefore I have to wear this stupid ass thing everywhere, warranting some unjustified and quite rude looks from random people who do NOT need to be judging a handicapped person.  Because of this monstrosity on my leg, I spent 5 hours in the Emergency Room Waiting area on Wednesday.... urg.  But, it should get better.

This weekend I'm going to the College Republicans quarterly meeting in Orlando... its also a joint meeting of the Republican Party of Florida (RPOF) so, it shall prove exciting.  I wish I didn't have to lug this abboration on my right leg around while looking shnazzy in a business suit, but oh well... what can you do, eh? 

Oh yeah... JACK... I had another dream about Sean Murray last night. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME??? Jeez... I have them all the time... There's gotta be something wrong with  my head. :) 

I miss you guys... if Jess doesn't see this, let her know what's going on, and why I haven't been around.  Next week... WE'RE DOING LUNCH, k?"

After I got back from lunch, I had 4 messages on my cell. I called my voicemail, and heard Brent say ""hey""... I knew something was very wrong just by the way he said it.  It sounds corny to say, but I can just tell from one syllable if something is up... So, I call Brent, and he tells me that last night between the ours of 11pm and 9am, Matthew Beeman committed suicide.  Matthew was a vocal major who is a good friend of Brent's, and a friend of mine. I saw him a week ago, and he gave me a hug and said ""How you doing, Princess?""... WHY??? The whole campus has shut down... I'm afraid of Brent shutting down... WHY?? No one knows why, or how.. no one is talking.  He was such a fun guy, so happy... I thought. He lived, literally, 4 doors down from Brent in his hall.  He dressed up as Elton John for Halloween to make everyone happy.  He stood in the doorway of Brents room and talked to me, for like, 30 minutes last month... and no one could have known that he wanted to take his own life.  WHY, MATTHEW??? Why would you do this? Why would anyone.  

I cry, but I feel guilty for crying.  He's not my best friend, not my suitemate or roommate, or schoolmate.  He just talked to me when I came to visit my boyfriend.  But this is the closest I've ever been to something like this.  I feel sad. I can't escape it.  I don't understand, nor do I know what to tell my boyfriend.  Brent just wants to help his suitemate, James, who was Matthew's best friend/boyfriend/whatever. That's just Brent's way... help other people, and not deal with it himself.

WHY, MATTHEW???"

I think I'm just starting to realize how hard this is... how impossible.  I mean, what was I thinking? Now don't get me wrong, I'm trying my hardest, and I'm going to continue to try, but I feel like such an idiot.

Maybe I'm just saying this because I'm tired and I've had a bad night.  I'm sooo excited about seeing him.  I mean, really... I think holding him in my arms after not holding him for 5 weeks will make a huge difference.  5 WEEKS! Jeez.  It has really flown by though, except for that little place in my that misses him immensely.  I think I'm just starting to realize how long our times apart are, and how difficult it is.  I don't want this to end, he's such a good guy, and such a great person... I just think we're both going a litte stircrazy.  I mean, I'm the biggest flirt in the world, and I'm meeting all these new guys and feeling guilty, and he's just getting impatient because of my mood swings and how he hasn't seen me in awhile.  And the thing is, I don't really want any of these other guys over him. Not at all.  I just want him.  Here.

Last night kicked butt! Went to ""Brothers"" with Dillon, Amelia, Carly and co... very fun. I really wish Jess and Candice could have come, you guys would have rocked out.  Anyways, it was a blast, and it helped me to just loosen up and laugh. (which i need)

This morning I woke up early and went to church with Sara (roommie) and Janet... very cool.  I love the Wesley Foundation, its really what I need right now. Actually, I'm slightly bummed that I can't go on the new member retreat this weekend, but when it comes to choosing between that and JACK sleepover+ Harry party, I have to say no to the retreat. :(  But hopefully there will be others. Anyways, after that went to brunch at RFOC. (verrrry good. yea for make your own belgian waffles! yum) Then the three of us went to wally world, bought necessities and hightailed it to Starbucks.  I am now officially addicted to Frappachinos.  It was like a super caffeinated coffee milkshake.  Actually, I don't know if all that caffeine was too good for me. I've been bouncing off the walls for about three hours now... everything in my head seems to be going REALLY quickly.  Perhaps I should opt for decaf now.

Soon I will be off to Steph's house for dinner and Sex.  ... (and the city) Haha. Get it? Sex and the City? oh well. Honestly, I just feel better about today.  I always seem to have a blast with Sara and Janet... they're a lot like me, and we can really laugh about the same things, so I had a chance to really just act silly today.  I think I've just been too uptight lately, with all of this Brentstress and Chiefstress... (yes those are words now) But I'm looking forward to not having a game until October 11th...

"event","I have yet to be truly feel homesick until today, and the only thing that I can totally recognize that  made me feel this way was what happened with JACK. See, now I don't know what to say and all because Candice and Amelia are going to read this, but fuck it... you guys can know how I feel, for once.  I just miss my old friends terribly, because I feel like they truly understood the way I am, and how I expect friendships to be.  I mean, I just..... ARRGGH. I don't even know how to put this.  Let me try again.  

To me, Friendships are some of the most important things you can have.  I guess that's why most of the friends that I still keep in contact with are my ""best friends"" like Steph and Dustin.  They understood that friends come first, that you always speak up and stand up for friendships, and whether or not you like conflict, when your friends are involved, so are you.  God, I'll never forget when Stephanie JUMPED over those booths in the lower mall my sophomore year to go bitch out Carrie... haha... and we weren't nearly ""best friends"" then.  Or when Dustin would tell Allison to shut the hell up about me, or whatever.  Those are what I consider the signs of friendship.  
Now, JACK, pllleeease don't get me wrong. You guys are my best friends in chiefs, and I'm really really lucky to have you, but... my feelings are kind of hurt.  I just lost it today with all of this, and for ONCE, and hopefully for the last time, I really wanted to back home, where people got involved in shit if their friends name was involved.  
You guys know that if it was you, I would do anything for you, talk to you, yell for you, fight for you, (flick random guys off), tell people off, or at least go tell someone to shove it if they're saying unnecessary things about you.  Amelia, it breaks my heart that this person pulled you aside to talk about me, and you were, as you described it, like ""whatever, i don't agree with you, but I'm out of it.""  It breaks my heart that I started crying in Amelia's car today, and it got silent. My friends didn't know what to say.  I had to call Jess to work things out, and we ended up essentially no better than we started, even though I apologized, and so did she.  It kills me that you write in your LJ, Amelia, and NOTHING is said about this. Well, its being said now. Apparently you guys didn't want to talk about the elephant standing in the corner, but I will. 

Now, I know we're different. And Jess did make a point that I am going to have to start just seeing our differences and being cool with them, and she's right, I will.  But I don't know what I will do if something like this happens again, where a chick that we're hanging out with is talking about me TO my friends, and around my friends, and instead of being on my side, they just waiver in the middle with indifference citing that it has ""nothing to do with them"". 

SO. There it is.  Don't be mad at me, this is just how I feel, guys, and I don't know what else to say other than that I'm sorry that this is ""such a big deal"" and that i'm making ""drama"" out of it.  The thing is that it is a big deal to me, and i really wanted to talk about it and work through it, not just cry by myself about it."

Basically, I was being a bitch to my boyfriend, as usual. (I honestly don't know why I do this) I guess I was still upset at him for not wanting to come see me this weekend because of his silly reasons that I won't mention. Anyways, I was being stupid, I guess expecting that if I just acted like an Ice Queen he'd want to come see me. Go figure. That's my logic.  Anyways, it just escalated and escalated, and seriously, he is THE most stubborn person in the world, with myself coming in a close second, which is NOT helpful.  Anyways, it just went really really bad, and he snapped.  He just clicked off, and started questioning our relationship, which scared the shit out of me.  I don't date boys who aren't sure. I just don't.  So I freaked out, and hung up, expecting to call my best friend and get some support. I really don't want to even say anything about that, because I expect that she will read this, but... whatever.  I would at least have expected her to wake up and at least FAKE cognizance or concern, but that didn't happen, so I hung up. Anyways, to make an already long story as short as possible, I tried to call Brent back, he wouldn't talk to me, then when he did he was all ""I don't know"" on me.  

This is where it gets odd, at least for me.  I always just assumed that when Brent and I didn't work out, I would just find another guy up here who would, in due time.  You know, like I could move on eventually and get over it. But, after I hung up with the man who ""loves me to death"" and always wanted to be with me ""forever"" and he was questioning our relationship, I got scared.  So, at 230 in the morning I walked out of my dorm and down towards the union. And I did what I always do in my head... muster strength and attempt to move on. But... I couldn't. I said to myself ""worst case scenario... he doesn't want to be with you anymore because you treat him like crap, but oh well....right?"" And then I panicked. It wasn't just oh well. How could I be so silly to let someone like him just walk away because I had been too pigheaded and bitchy to realize what I had in the first place??? I just couldn't. I've seen what FSU has to offer, I've seen the vulgar, ungentlemanly creeps that are produced by this fine institution, and I don't want any part of it.  Brent treats me like gold, he deals with my crap, he truly loves me... and he's amazing. And here I was trying to tell myself that I didn't care if he walked away... Bullshit. I cared. All of a sudden, while walking towards the union, I realized how damn lucky I was, and how I would do anything to not loose this man.  So, I called him, right there, in the deserted union on a payphone, bawling my eyes out, pretty much abandoning all pride and pleading with him to forgive me. Thank god I didn't need to do all that, because he said the same thing.  

Perhaps this seems over dramatized to you all, ... but it was.  It was an EXTREMELY emotional night, and I know its not over, and a lot of things need to be dealt with between the two of us.  But, I think I really changed at 230 in the morning on Landis Green.  I saw what Brent has been saying for the last year... and I actually heard it, and wanted to hear it, and talk about it without rolling my eyes and saying ""whatever, honey... we'll see"".  
Perhaps some of you who read this don't know Brent, or don't like him, or whatever, but he really is an amazing person.  And its sad that it took me so long to realize how amazing he was and how lucky I am.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he's THE ONE, but damn... I sure hope whoever is the one will be very much like him.  I just can't deal with the guys (boys) here. They're just small children who think they're cool for drinking, or cursing, or treating others like crap. A large majority of them are just not what I'm looking for, nor will they ever be what I'm looking for. 

So, there you have it. My little soap opera revelation. It feels good to just let it all out. I just never knew how much I loved this man.  Jeez.  

Well, enough blabbering. I have so much to say, but I don't want to sound like a loser, so I will close with this poignant quote:
            ""Love is like war: Easy to start, but difficult to end""

"event","Ack! Had my first football game as a Marching Chief last night, and it was totally amazing.  I really had a blast, even though JACK was separated... haha... Jessica and I still rocked out! Anyways, PreGame was amazing.  Its funny how I used to make fun of Chiefs (at least a little) for being so cultish and intense, when really its just a blast, and a great way to adapt to college life. 

I must admit, everything has been a little intense lately, as I try to assimilate myself to this new life, its hard keeping everything going, and then every once in awhile, I glance around and get a chance to realize how far away from home I am.  Its like I'm confused... I don't know whether to be homesick, or happy... mostly I'm happy. :)  Every once in awhile I get a little overwhelmed, and I yearn for the simplicity of high school, but this is once in a blue moon.  Today was a little tough, but just because Brent and I have had some issues... I don't know where that's going, except that I love him and miss him too much for words.

Well, I'm definately blabbering. Enough of that.  Back to the football game. Ah, yes... football. Very fun.  Not the football itself, but the game was awesome. I checked out some parties afterwards with my girls, but... alas... I just don't think I'm really the party type.  That's probably better in the long run.

Well, I left on Friday around 12 (""JACK"" called me on the way, and said that they missed me, which was ssooo cute.... definately made me smile)... and got to stetsont that evening. It was so wonderful to see Brent, and just sit and talk to him face to face, to hold his hand, to ride in car and just... be.  It so funny to go away, and feel as though you've changed, and then come back and realize you are still essentially the same person, with the same loves, and emotions and quirks. With him I'm still, and always will be a little girl playing big, pretending to be in control and aware. Anyways... he took me to Olive Garden (oh so commercial and franchised, but oh so good after weeks of FSU). I needed breaksticks. I really really did.  :)  
On Saturday I surprised my parents, which was great. Lucy is cuter than ever... ( I am such a dog person.. oh well... I love my baby)  Parents were sooo nice to me. Hm... perhaps I should visit more often. Dad was like ""i'll make anything you guys want for dinner, blah blah blah) very cool. And then I just chilled at home, saw a movie, ate marble slab ice cream.  (In case you haven't noticed, the recurring theme in my weekend is eating. Normally this would make me very selfconscious, but screw it. I have a boyfriend who spoils me, and I haven't eaten real food in 2 weeks) ACK! Almost forgot... we took lucy on a walk in the park by the river, and saw the most beautiful dolphin feeding and playing. It was such a cool moment... I can't even describe it. 
Sunday, we went to the beach! It was heaven. I love Playalinda. It is, and always will be, my beach. Kissed the parents goodbye, went back to stetson, piddled around daytona, etc...

Weekends like that leave you refreshed, but also change your perspective on things. I'm glad i saw the parents, but I'm not really that homesick. I miss Brent more now that I had such a great weekend with him. What can I say.. I'm selfish... I just wanted more time.  

But I'm back, and I'm stoked about seeing Jack again... not to mention this weeks football game!!! AHHHHHHH!!!!!

So much has gone on, and I didn't even realize it until I read my friend Amelia's LJ.... she talked about all her cheifs/fsu stuff, and I was, like, OH MY GOD... all of this has gone on in my life, and no one knows!! Ok, so that's a little exaggeration, because you all talk to me, but anyways.

First of all, let me say that I LOVE cheifs, I love FSU, and I loooovvveee JACK. (I shall explain)  ""Jack"" is an acronym for my chiefs friends, consisting of Jessica, Amelia, Candice, and Kirsten, therefore creating Jack. Its just so much easier to say that I'm going out with ""jack"" then listing the aforementioned names.  They have supported me, lifed me up, and just made this whole new experience so muuuccchh easier.  Its hard for everyone to adapt to a new environment, and especially such a rite of passage as going to school, but the combo of Chiefs and Jack has made it much easier (not to mention the recent arrival of my bestest and always bestest friend Stephamanie) ... I really enjoy my new life here, and I haven't really had a lot of time to be lonely, or homesick.  Moving on....

Chiefs is great. Its soooo much work, but I know when I first walk into that Doak stadium in a week (OH MY GOD GUYS... ITS A WEEK) it will all seem so amazing.  These people are so serious about what they do, and so centered, and everything is just right. Instead of there just being a FEW people who care about the drill, or sonority, or comraderie, its the ENTIRE FREAKIN BAND!!!  Thank god I'm finally in a respected respectable group.  Its great. 

My classes are hard, and I feel bad that I don't have as much time as some of my other friends, (ie pieces and jack) to hang out... but I promise guys, I'M TRYING!!

Anyways, I leave tomorrow around noon to go see my boy... I'm very very very excited. I miss him more than I thought I would, and I can't even think about holding him again.  Although 2 weeks isn't that long of a time, we've been what seems like worlds apart. So... I shall return on Monday afternoon.  CALL ME, FRIENDS OF MINE! I get free incoming, and I would love to talk to you!"

My roommate, Sara, is quite cool.  Of course, after talking to her for two months, and thinking that I know what she looks like, I was totally wrong. She's very pretty, and very skinny. arg. (I'm arging about the skinny, not the pretty) I mean, maybe she can help me. Seriously, we went to Baja Burrito Kitchen (my very favoritist place) and she didn't even eat all of her chips or her quesadilla (which I know Brent and I usually consider appetizer-like portions) ... and then she was ""too full"".  Made me feel very bad for hungrily scarfing down my massive burrito, but oh well... she has to get used to it. As far as conversation goes, she was cool, and took a little bit to open up.  By the time we went to Bed, Bath, and Beyond, we were already making fun of each other and laughing at our shopping antics. And thank God I felt comfortable shopping/spending money with her! Then we went on a very entertaining trek in her car around Orlando/Winter springs --- where she lives.  I learned a lot about Orlando roads, and I honestly never knew where Winter Springs was. But I believe I really started to enjoy myself when she opened up and took me to her house, by her school, and her favorite italian ice place (which was really good AND very cheap).  I met her mom, her dog (he's a boxer named Joe Frasier--how cute!!) and she really loosened up! Yeeeaaa. Then I met her best/very close friend who seemed to think I was sooooo cool. (that's always a shocker, but flattering) 

By the end of the day I felt super comftorble, and even borrowed a book from her.  I have 3 more people on my buddy list... just because they're her friends, and they want to talk to me! :)  I'm glad I met her... It wasn't an uncomftorble, stilted meeting like I thought it would be. It really gave me the oppourtunity to be myself with the person who is going to have to deal with me. We were able to see each other in our element, so that maybe we can relate better when we're far away from what we know. All in all... I feel better about leaving. I just hope we can stay friends when we actually have to be in a confined space. hmmmmmm..."

""Yes, um, I would like one roommate: someone who is open, honest, aggressive sans passive manipulation, quirky, understanding, and enjoys ice cream"". Hmmm.... oh well. This will be much more interesting. It will be like reaching my hand into a box full of candy bars and pirhanas and not knowing what the hell is chewing on my hand. 
Actually, so far Sara (my roommie) seems quite easy to get along wiht. (except that she doesn't like ice cream and mass-produced foods. This could be a problem) She's witty, makes me laugh, says what she means and means what she says (very important) and doesn't seem petty or stupid. She can most definately hold her own in a conversation, without cut downs or condescending remarks. 

But... we shall see. I called her today, after we had planned for a week to meet. She didn't seem too excited or motivated, but not totally apathetic. I cannot stand apathy. Even about stupid things. Just have a goddamn opinion, you know?  She's probably just trying to be nice, and therefore seeming slightly indifferent to what we shall do. Hm. I have a feeling she shall open up... its in there.

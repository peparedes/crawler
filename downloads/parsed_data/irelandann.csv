"event","So I was sitting around last night NOT doing homework as usual.  Anways I was surfing online, looking at all the usual sites looking for spoilers for Gilmore Girls WISHING and HOPING there would be something new.  But alas there was nothing.  But I come online this morning and take a look and alas there is something new.  And oh holy shit, and for the love of God and all that beeswax.  Becuase I don't know that I can handle what ASP came up with this time.  It's just CRAZY!  I mean it could be interesting in a way and it'll definitly send the town and especially Lorelai into a whirl.  But my goodness when I was hoping for spoilers I wasn't hoping for anything along these lines....  Still in shock!

And YAYYY Ryan's home on AMC!!!  I was totally not expecting it to move this fast!  I figured they would drag it out and out and out and out till November sweeps killing us with near misses and thigns like that.  But they did it all within 2 days.  Like DUDE Ryan SAWWW Greenlee today and he KISSED Greenlee and today."

"event","So I started to watch Braveheart, the movie, obviously, tonight.  Lori you were right, BORING ASS MOVIE!  I couldn't get through it.  I gave up and went to the movie store for like half an hour tryign to figure out what to get.  I ended up getting ""the Apartment"" and ""Notorious.""  So far the Apartment is ok, much better than Braveheart.  

So it's been a hectic few weeks around here.  School started, which is good, I can spend time at school instead of ALL my time at home.  Doing that is enough to drive a person batty.  Especially with Mom all stressed out about Dad and Rosie.  The poor cat (Rosie) was sick, so we took her to the vet and she ended up going for surgery and they found some ribbon type thing in her stomach/intestine.  So then she comes home and is moping around and not really eating and drinking.  So we take her back and they give her an IV, so she comes home.  Then she goes back the next day because she has a fever.  So that means Mom can't go to the U2 concert.  So I end up going with dad.  It was all right.  I didn't really know any of their songs, and I really didn't want to go, so I really wasn't all that excited.  But oh well.  Anyways so they do surgery on Rosie again to see if they can find anything wrong.  They didn't find anything... Well she finally perked up a little yesterday.  She still doesn't seem to want to eat on her own.  So she has a feeding tube and gets to wear a cone around her head.  LUCKY HER!  We have a conehead cat walking around the house.  She runs into everything with the cone and even hits the cone on the floor.  So basically Mom is just all wound up about Rosie and Dad too I guess.  

So I went to the movie store after I was sick of Braveheart (see above) and I come home and Mom grills me.  I was like leave me alone.  She asks what'd I get, so I told her.  She goes, ""don't they have old movies at the library?""  I was like no not really, otherwise I wouldn't have this problem.  OYE.  Then she goes, you don't have any snacks down there do you?  I was like no, why the hell do you care?  None of your business.  She also goes, no one around tonight?  I'm like no not really, thus the whole watching a movie by myself thing.  Which btw, I'm fine with. No big deal.  She seems to be obsessed with me finding all these new friends and stuff.  I'm like dude leave me alone.

But next Wednesday I get to go do more Irish dancing-step dancing.  Like square dancing but Irish.  So that should be cool.  And there's a ceili next Friday night, and a session type thing on Saturday at school.  Hopefully I can actually learn some new songs on whistle.  I could stop playing the annoying ones I learned in Limerick.  

On another note, can I just say how GLAD I am that the new tv season has started.  I'm loving it!!!!  There's new tv every night of the week.  Now if only Dad would get the network working so I could transfer stuff from the Tivo, since I was the one that got the whole ball rolling on that anyways.  *sigh*"

"event","Oh what a day we had yesterday.  We got up early to head over to Burbank to do the WB tour.  We left an hour before we had to be there, thinking it would take that long.  Ended up only taking like half an hour.  So we wandered around the shop for a very long time and fihgured out what we were going to buy.  At the beginning of the WB tour they showed us this cool video they put together of video clips of WB movies and WB history.  Then we went on the tour of the HUGE backlot.  Very, very, very cool!  Our tour guide kicked ass and let us do all sorts of Gilmore Girls stuff.  We got to see downtown Stars Hollow, and Suki's House which is the other side of Lorelai's and Rory's house.  We got our pictures taken outside of Rory and Lorelai's house!  We also saw Luke's diner, and were taking pictures from outside, but then the door was unlocked so our tour guide let us go in!  We were INSIDE Luke's diner.  It was actually REALLY tiny!  But definitly WAY cool.  We also saw the Twickham House.  And we got to see the inside of the Dragonfly Inn.  Everything definitly seems smaller than it is on tv.  We also got to see the Central Perk set.  With the orange couch and  everything.  We have a bunch of pictures of it.  And Kate and I have our picture on the orange couch.  We got to see a lot of other stuff too, but those were defintly the highlights.  We saw Scott Patterson's parking spot, but no sign of him.  I got all sorts of stuff at the WB shop including a Bogie collection of movies.  VERY exciting!!!

After that we went to Universal City Walk, which was definitly not exciting.  But we got lunch and ice cream, so that was cool.  Then we were bored so we just went to the parking lot where we had to meet for a taping of According to Jim. Eventually the shuttle came and we were herded over to CBS.  The actual taping took like 4 and a half hours.  It was insane.   But it was cool to see how it was done.  They did most of the scenes about three times, so the jokes got old by the third take.  The girls are TINY!  It's insane, who knew people could be that skinny."

"event","We saw Hollywood today.  It was actually pretty cool.  Definitly sounds much cooler than it is in person.  But we had a lot of fun and saw a bunch of stuff.  We started out by finding  Bogie and Bacall's old house, and then we went to see the HOllywood sign.  I have a bajillino pictures of it, just getting closer and b igger everytime.  It was really cool, we actually drove up into the hills and got really close to it.  Then we went to lucnh and after we went to find Syd's house.  We found it!!!  Have tons of pictures of that too.  Then we went to Grauman's Chinese theater with all the footprints and the handprints in front of it.  We took pictures of a bunch of them, of all our favorite stars.  We also went to a tacky, HOllywood Entertainment museum, the coolest part was the ""Cheers"" set.  AND!!!  We saw Ray Ramano outside the Ivy, some really expensive restaurants/bar place.  It was really cool.  We were all excited.  Then we took a bunch of pictures of hte ""stars"" on Hollywood Boulevard.  After that we went on a lil driving tour around Beverly Hills that was in one of the guidebooks, finding old stars homes.  We saw Lucille balls old one, and Jimmy Stewarts and Marlene Deitrichs.  We had fun, although we definitly kept getting lost and all turned around.  But we made it through the tour.  There are TONS and TONS and TONS of houses, up in the hills and off the big main streets, who knew?  They are really cool, big and expensive houses!  Kate and I were trying to figure out who would actually have enough money to live in those houses.  People here are LOADED with money, they drive Beamers and have these huge houses, that have to cost at LEAST 5 million.  Anyways off to eat dinner, and tomorrow we're going to the WB tour and a taping of According to Jim.  Should definitly be cool!"

"event","I couldn't think of a title for this, it's driving me crazy!  I'm at work and bored once again, because, oh yeah.  There is NOTHING to do.  C'mon people.  Anyways I think I am offically all packed for LA, except for the digital camera.  Which I HAVE to remember to take from the other car.  I have it written on my hand in permanent marker, maybe that will remind me.  I tried to pack it all into my little duffel, but that definitly did NOT work.  I didn't have that much stuff, I'm NOT allowed to bring that much stuff.  It just didn't fit, and I'm wearing my stupid hiking boots because they're the biggest thing.  I just hope they don't make me take my shoes off, what a pain that will be.  So I stole dad's duffel and was like if he minds, too bad, he's not home to tell me I can't.  He didn't care, he told me when he came home.  So i have my duffel, and my backpack, which is defintely crammed full of snacks and books, and my messenger bag.  If that's too much stuff to fit in the car, too bad.  Kate said it should be fine, let's just hope that she didn't gain too much stuff while out in LA.  Otherwise theres no way we'll make it home.  I think the thing I am most excited for, is the WB tour.  I'm DYING to see the Gilmore Girls set.  I think it will kick ass, and maybe I'll even get to see some of them.  If I'm lucky, although I doubt I will be.  Emily is the one with all the luck."

"event","Hey that could be a new band name.  There is just a sense of mopiness and doom around me tonight, for whatever reason.  I was GREAT this afternoon, Emily and I had a blast going down to the outlets and blaring Wicked and singing at the top of our lungs.  Then I got home and ran some errands then tried to make  a pizza. Yeah, that did NOT work.  I just SUCK at making frozen pizza.  I burn myself or it breaks in the oven or i leave the cardboard on.  *sigh*
So i ended up eating rice krispie squares for dinner.  What a dinner, let me tell you.  

So add onto the fact that I'm already down in the dumps about MV and GH.  Anne calls me at 10 o clock tonight to inform me about working at German Fest tomorrow.  Emily and I volunteered to help at the beginning of the summer.  So there was PLENTY of time to give us all the info about when and where, and all those details.  Yet she waits till 10 the night before to tell us.  Yes she has been busy with German fest all week and Brigid being gone at work, but STILL.  She's had the info FOREVER.  And apparently we have to take care of transportation as well tomorrow.  She's lucky Mom and Dad left me with the car.  For whatever reason that just made me SUPER cranky.  But I am watching Nip/Tuck and Sean and Christian are keeping me company.  Two hot men, gotta love it.  This show is CRAZY but i LOVE IT!!!!"

ABC is screwing us over, first Journey (yeah I'm still not over that, I don't think I will ever be), then they're screwing over NikE (ASSES!!!!) and now they're taking MV away from this, although supposedly it was of his own will (like I believe that!).  It just sucks, theyre RUINING my shows.  Not that GH wasn't long gone, it started going down hill when they decided to extend the panic room all summer in 2003.  And then our beloved Tams left, I still miss her so much.  And Alicia's contract is up soon, I hope she leaves,  I really do.  And I think Tyler's is up soon as well, maybe he'll leave too.  They already dumped the show down the drain, i don't see any reason for them to continue.  I think I'm still in shock over MV (praying against all hope that it isn't him, you better still be praying Bri).  Might as well just watch the OC and tape Alias, whoever thought that day would come, when Alias wasn't my first priority.  I sure as hell didn't."

Make sure you have your tissues, when you get towards the end, you'll need em.  I think this is the most intriguing of the books so far.  Definitly not the most action packed and it didn't seem to follow the same pattern as the others, but that's ok, because it answered a lot of stuff and left me with about a MILLION more questions... And i had em all written down because i had nothign better to do during the meeting but daydream about Harry Potter, haha.  But of course I left my notepad at work.  Oh well, tomorrow.  Lori you better be ready with all my questions.  At least I'll have something to do in the afternoon tomorrow after Mary's done blabbing away at me.  Get to spend the morning with her, which I guess isn't all that bad, because she's great and I don't see her very often.  After hte meeting which SUCKED and was boring, seriously was about to be bored to tears.  I was talking to Krys and Patti who are the payroll ladies behind me, and Krys goes you poor thing you were at that meeting ALL DAY!  I was like yeah, it was really boring.  So she told me to go home and do something fun.  I was like I think I can handle that.  We're supposed to be watching ""The Upside of Anger"" tonight.  

My computer shipped!!!! WHOO HOO!! It shipped FedEx and shoudl be here tomorrow, WHOO HOO!!!!!!!!!!!  So exciting. At first I thought it shipped through DHL, and I was having a shit fit, because they lost Lizzie's computer and were REALLY stupid about it.  But DHL is only doing my docking station and easy media creator, I can handle that.  I think enough rambling for now..."

Although we did start talking about Emily Fox which is ALWAYS good gossip, after all these years we still want to know all the gossip about her.  And apparently her mom wouldn't even talk to Anne's mom at the Pink Shirt party.  The issue was between the girls, NOT the rents.  I swear that family needs help.  Hugs to my Tiff, she's having a bad day!!!  So my mom started hounding me again bout finding a job for January, I'm like mom im jsut trying to suffer through the ACS.  It's bad enough there, with my shitty internship.  I guess it's good that it pays.  I was sooo cranky this morning, i was having such a bad day, I just wanted to get out of there.  And then Mary calls at like 2:30 going can you do this stuff for the meeting tomorrow?  I was like umm ok, i can try, but she never gave me any feedback on the project ideas i sent her at the end of last week.  So she was definitly no help there.  SO i tried to whip something up, but I was having a brain fart because I was so stressed out.  I sent it off to her so we'll see how much crack she thinks I'm on.  I was already stressed out when she called, Word was being stupid as usual.  But at least she seemed grateful that I was doing it instead of her.  That was nice.  

And Lori, our convo's on MSN are VERY meaningful, just cause Beth and I were trying to out Star Wars each other, doesn't mean it didnt require brain power.  We were referencing BOTH triologies!

I decided to wait on getting a printer, becuase Dad says I can just use the crappy old one of his till we figure out which one I should get.  Im not going to get the multi function one, cause the scanner is a POS on it, so I have to figure out a decent printer to get now.  Dad said he would look in the PC mags he has.  He also fixed the old scanner, I still havent told him I broke the other one, oh well, maybe he won't have to find out cause he fixed the other big one.  Anyways back to the point, my computer is supposedly going to ship around August 1st, which I find VERY exciting!!!!  I just cannot wait for my new computer.  I'll just have to find a place to set it up... Hmmm, no room in my room... Guess I'll have to find somewhere on the floor.  

Ok I still can't breathe after like 5 plus puffs on my inhaler, GRRR, there must be some mold or mildew around here that I came across. Guess I'm done for now, off to the cottage for the rest of the weekend, if Lizzie ever gets here.  Lets GO LIZZIE!!!!! I wanna goooooooooooooooooooooo."

"event","Bri went on errands, Lori is on brb, and Beth's eating lunch, Sonja went to the bank.  *hmph* Leaving me to my own devices to keep me busy at work, NOT such a good thing.  

Umm well I could whine and moan about work and how my boss is bugging the shit out of me, but I'll save that for later.  Stupid MM!  Makes me all emotional and hormonal.  I think I'm gonna skip lunch today and go home early.  Cause theres stuff I want to do at home, but i'm here, not there.  So that poses a problem.  Ok enough rambling, off to find some work to do.  UGH!"

"event","Stupid POS printer broke last night.  I just wanted to print something, but NOOO my printer went kaput on me.  Making all sorts of funny grinding noises and not feeding hte paper through.  Guess it's a good thing that I saved extra money for my computer, cause I'm gonna need it now.  Just can't win with my electronics.  Guess I'm not getting my mp3 player like I wanted.  *sigh*

And what's this about a surprise Bri?  Huh, huh, huh???  I wanna know!!!

Oh well onto other things, Bri sent me this amazing Journey video last night, that I think is now my #2 favorite video.  Nothing can beat the ""Journey story"" one.  THat one is just damn amazing and makes me cry everytime.  OH look once again back to GH.  Can't escape that damn godforsaken show, can I?  GRR!!!!!!! I wanna go to LA and knock some sense into GaP, then maybe we'd get our Journey and our NikE, and the damn Hedgehog (yes that would be Jax), get his own life AWAY from Courtney and Courtney could stop being a stupid Barbie.  On another note, can we still call Jax, Blaine?  Dumb ass Ingo dyed his hair brown, can we all say, ""you look STUPID.""  He looked bad enough with the blonde but the brown is just NOOOOOO!

Another random thought, watching AMC from yesterday and it looks like Tadius Martinus (Tad) is wearing lipstick!  HAHAHAHA!!!!"

"event","It's been a while...
    So it's been awhile.  I just haven't been wanting to write and I actually had something to do at work today, as frustrating as it was.  But I got it done on time, so whoo hoo!!!  Lizzie and I highlighted our hair the other day.  It sort of worked.  I'm waiting till I can go out in the sun with some lemon juice to make it come out more, which is what hte cottage is for.  2 days till Meaghan comes... I'm not sure I'm ready for this, but hey it'll be an adventure and hopefully a lot of fun.  We had a car wash at work today and I actually met some of the people that work at the ACS and even someone that worked on ""that side"" which I was never shown.  I was just told there are people and some offices over there.  I was like well one would think.  But it was nice to be outside during the day and we had an ice cream social afterwards so I had ice cream for lunch.  YUM!  Nothing too insightful today, maybe something more tomorrow when I'm home all day.  Lots of time to think.  Haha!  I'm sure no one is actually reading this, but it's an interesting idea and it makes me feel less guilty about not keeping a diary.  Soo I guess I'll talk to everyone online sooner or later.  Whoo hoo for IM.  Have a good day/night everybody!


The road goes South but NOT North
    Lizzie and I went on an adventure tonight, attempting to get to Grafton from Brown Deer.  We made it to Old Navy fine.  But afterwards trying to get to Grafton on Green Bay road we ended up in Cedarburg.  Apprently Green Bay road has no trouble going South but North it does not do.  Now how does that work?  We tried to take Green Bay road after ending up in downtown Cedarburg and we thought we found it, but we ended up right back in downtown Cedarburg.  Eventually we made it to 43 and headed north to Saukville and Port Washington, only to find out that the Wal Mart there was CLOSED.  The whole reason for the adventure in the first place.  But we did end up getting Dairy Queen.  All the way to Saukville just for DQ.  We suck at live Lizzie!


  So I just read ""THE"" for about the millionth time and it was very hard not to cry.  Damn you Laurie!  Journey... *sigh*  Stupid GH assholes just had to take them away from us. 
    So I woke up this morning and my cheek bone REALLY hurt, I musta hit it in the middle of the night or something.  But then I was looking at it a few hours ago and only part of it hurt, not all of it.  What's up with that?  Maybe one of these days I'll stop hurting myself, yeah right!  I'll just keep rambling away here because there really is no one to talk to, Bri you just HAD to go to work didn't you?  Well everyone keep your fingers crossed that the hurricane doesn't effect Lori down there in Florida.  I guess that's all for now.



Yoga, Schmoga
    Soo I started yoga today.  It was eh... Not really my thing.  Oh well, only two more weeks of it.  Not much happened today, I had the day off so I sat on my ass.  Party!

    I wanted to post a funny comic for you, but NOOOO html won't work.  OOHHH BRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII, the all knowing html Goddess, where ARE you when I need you?



I have a blog, WHA?

 I mean why not?  Weellll don't have too much to say.  My legs are really sore, thanks to Emily's energy burst yesterday.  Thanks Em!  Although it did feel good and I can't wait to do it again tonight, let's hope it doesn't rain.  So we're going to see the musical ""Wicked"" this weekend and I couldn't be more excited for our grand adventure down to Chicago (and yes i did just see Chee-ca-go).  Wow this is going to be a busy summer.  First Chicago, then Madison with Laurie and Meaghan, another adventure that I will need serious recovering from.  I guess that's what Monday morning's at work are for.  Well that's all till I think of something new and exciting to say...."

"event","Since graduation I have found myself with a dearth of time on my hands, which has lead to a great deal of introspection and reflection (though not the standard emo variety to which I have become accustom) and it has lead me down a road of renewal and rebirth, a personal renaissance if you will, regarding how I view myself, the world, and the way things work.

Before I can say goodbye to the Henry of yesteryear completely, however, there are still a few outstanding items I'd like to address in the skeleton-filled closet that is my past. These particular skeletons take the form of 'the three Gs' which I have found myself consumed by as of late.

Graduation:
It went remarkably well. I didn't have a panic attack or embarrass myself or anything. I truly felt changed as I grasped my diploma, not dissimilar to how children grasp their favorite toy or blanket, the actual object itself not so important, but its symbolism of security and understanding comforting and validating all on its own. I have stepped through the doorway to adulthood, not as reluctantly as I thought I might have, and I must admit, I have found myself pleasantly surprised with the freedom (and even the restraint and responsibility) that has awaited me on the other side. Like seeing an old friend after a lengthy absence, I am reminded of a time when things were much simpler and I spent my time worry-free, basking in the warm, loving glow of my family and loved ones, occupying my time with the trivial activities I so loved. I do not know how long this transitional period will last, but I do know I will love every minute of my existence while I am in it, and harbor no further regrets. Speaking of regrets...

Girls:
My high school romantic experiences have been turbulent and sporadic, occurring less frequently over time, and then in rapid succession, only to be further spaced out by drought. I would like to send some last words to all the girls I have wronged/been wronged by over these past four years, though most of them will likely never hear these words:

Mackenzie- I am so sorry for everything that has ever happened between us. I am so sorry you had to be the girl I learned how to love from. I fucked so much shit up between us because I was young and stupid, and every time I see you I silently pray for your present and future happiness. There is no ill will between us, at least on my end. Go into the world and be what you have always meant to be. Goodbye and good luck.

Nicole- I always have and always will love you. You are never far from my thoughts, and to this day I entertain fantasies of what we would be like if we were still together. It is sick, and obsessive that after 2 years I still cannot let you go, but I have never been as happy, before or since I was with you. I may never know that happiness again, but I am thankful I was given what little time we had, because from you I learned truly what love is and I will never have to worry about never having experienced something as pure or as a beautiful as what we had. You deserve so much happiness that I know I could never do you justice. Though time and distance may separate us now, you will always remain near in my heart.

Chelssy- You met me at a very weird time in my life. I'm so sorry I roped you into my paranoid delusion that unless I found someone right then and there who could look at me with hungry eyes, the way only you can seem to, that I was worthless. I tried to use you to validate me and once I realized that was selfish, I became despondent until you left me. It was the right decision to make and it shows how strong a person you are; you know what you deserve, you know what you want, and how to get it. Never lose sight of these things and you will go far in life. You are the only person on this list I honestly think I don't have to worry about for the future; you will do just fine, wherever you go.

Mallory- You made the unfortunate mistake of being nice to me, not knowing I have a tendency to fall in love with every girl who shows me the slightest bit of attention. You are an amazing person who deserves someone equally amazing and I am so sorry I tried to cheapen our relationship with messy, shallow, meaningless, physical entanglements. It was a weak point in my life and I am eternally ashamed of how I acted around you. Please forgive me, I was lonely and alienated from the world around me. The kindness and warmth you showed to me meant more to me then then you will ever know.

Brittany- You are forever my enigma wrapped in a conundrum. Quite possibly, you are the girl in my high school life I will look back on with the greatest fondness. I will never forget that shining night in early Decemeber at Chelssy's house when you looked into my eyes, kissed me, and told me that I was beautiful. That single utterance has meant more to me than anything else anyone has ever said to me in my entire life. You were kind to me, you loved me, you let me love you, and then...you shunned me. And I will never know why. But some things are better left unknown. You are my single, biggest regret, because you are the most perfect girl that I have ever met, and the knowledge that I am not a strong enough human being to tame you still burns in the periphery of my conscious mind.

Theresa- You once told me you couldn't believe I loved you if you thought you could have just been 'any other girl'. I didn't fully grok those words until just this moment, but it perfectly encapsulates our predicament. I DID love you. I loved you wholly and completely. I defied all odds and rational thought and intensely loved every inch of you. Every time I kissed you, I felt something so amazing and so right that I couldn't ever bear to know that perhaps, just perhaps, THIS would be the last time. So where did things go wrong? <i>You</i> didn't love <i>me</i>. <i>I</i> was just 'another guy'. One more uninteresting, soulless husk of a man who threw himself into your path. How could you have done anything besides walk all over me? All because I didn't play the guitar, I didn't drink and get high every weekend, because I truly understood and accepted every dark, gothic corner of your being. But that's not what you're looking for. You're looking for someone you can hide from. Someone you can lie to. Someone you can pretend with. But I'd never let you pretend. You couldn't ever lie to me. I hope someday you're ready for a real, adult relationship with someone, and I hope you find someone special to share that with. I think you'll find, once you give it a try, that it's actually much more fulfilling.

Wow, that felt amazing. 4 years worth of sadness and pent up emotions, vomitted up, violently into a few paragraphs of incoherent babble...

Grief:
I could not have felt less attached to my high school. I always thought that there was something wrong with me, because I didn't like any of the people I knew. I found them all flat, static, two dimensional. No one seemed good enough for me. I used to think that was because I was fucked up and hyper-critical. But I realize now that I was just resisting the conformity that all youths have to go through in high school; find a clique, or be alone. I didn't think I could spend 4 years in complete social solitude, but by god I did it, and I emerged more or less unscathed. I will now enter the real world and find newer and more interesting people and form bonds with them that will be so rewarding and fulfilling I'll wonder why I ever even wasted the neurons processing the presence of some of the people I knew in high school. Meanwhile, they will continue to live their high school lives, over and over, ad nauseum until they awake one fateful day to realize they are 30 and still acting like they are 18. That will be a rude awakening, to be sure.

That is all. I am so happy with who I am and where I am right now that I can't even imagine some of the despair that is chronicled in this journal. Next week, I will be getting my license to drive my new car (which I absolutely adore), Colin and I will begin our apartment hunt, and then life as an adult will truly begin. I cannot wait.

This will be the last time I ever pen any words into this journal. It has served well for its purpose; that is, chronicling the hapless misadventures of a disaffected, disillusioned, emo high school student, but that time has passed. It is full of too many bad memories and shattered dreams that even staring at its front page sends chills up my spine. This is not who I am anymore, and it seems so disfigured to me now that I cannot even recognize what morbid, self-hating corner of my brain it was born from.

I will leave this journal up until the very bits on the hard drive it is stored on has decayed and rotten due to the ravages of time, with the hope that perhaps someday some one else, perhaps a similarly maligned young child, will happen upon it and find that no matter how detached from the world around them they feel, they are never truly alone.

Perhaps someday, some lonely night down the road it will occur to me to start a new live journal, to start a new chapter in my life, but this chapter, like all, must ultimately have an ending. A point of no return; a point of completion, though the reader must be content in the knowledge that what they have just read can never, EVER, be unread.

This is that point. 

Goodbye, high school. You were the worst thing that ever happened to me."

"event","Man, I'm in a really good place right now.

As you may have surmised from my previous entry I've begun to immerse myself in the field of discovery and self-betterment that is neurolingusitic programming and several other schools of analysis regarding social dynamics (particularlly relating to male/female relationships vis-a-vis courting, attraction, love, etc) and all I can say is...wow. I've never felt such clarity and understanding of the world and the way people work as I do right now. Learning about communication is so vital to understanding it and making work for you and with you.

Part of the ASF seduction manuscript I've been reading has been about improving yourself by establishing a strong frame or mental window through which we percieve the world and learning how to demonstate value to other people by having a strong emotional center and learning to draw interest from others by achieving congruence between the way you are and the way you act around others. It's truly a mind-blowing experience to be actively engaging in activities and behaviors which increase your self-esteem and sense of worth and entitlement, and at the same time allow others to see that within you as well.

I'm trying to take it one step at a time, right now focusing on how to not be 'reactive' regarding male/female relationships. Realizing that I am in control of my own emotions and feelings and I am an inherently useful human being of worth, regardless of how other people (specifically objects of romantic desire) feel about me or act around me is an immensely rewarding feeling and I no longer feel drawn to find 'completeness' within others. I am whole and perfect in and of myself. We all are.

Here are a few things I've learned in my journey to self-betterment so far, and it may behoove you to examine these principles and see if you can draw anything from them:

- The ability to change the process by which we experience reality is more often valuable than changing the content of our experience of reality. 

- The map is not the territory.

- People already have all the resources they need.

- Life and 'Mind' are systemic processes.

- Underlying structure matters more than specific content.

- Behind every behavior is a positive intention.

- There is no failure, only feedback.

- The meaning of your communication is the response you get.

Applying these sorts of principles and axioms to my every day life will be tricky sure, but for the first time in a long while I feel confident that I can evoke a change in my own life. It is a truly magical feelings.

Let's see how my first attempt at life-narration goes, keeping all these things in mind, and with me acting out of a desire to demonstrate high value.

~*~

It all comes back to Theresa. She has been the focal point of my life for the past few months, in a very big, self-destructive way. I have put myself in this position because of my lack of self-worth and allowed these terrible events to unfold around me and then claim ignorance when my actions of consequences.

That said, truly, the way I feel about her has not changed one iota. I simply percieve the situation and our actions, differently.

She has 2 months left in this town, a 2 month window to decide whether or not I am worth the trouble of acknowledging my 'romantic elligiblity', if you will. I've tried everything that I thought I knew to demonstate high value to her. I showed her jerkiness, indifference, compassion, neglience, sweetness, thoughtfulness, everything I thought might get me what I wanted. The problem that has arisen is that most of those things are alright, and may very well have worked out for me, if only I had been congruent about it. She's seen so many faces, she can't possibly be expected to know which ones were real, which ones were defense mechanisms, which ones were elaborate lies meant to decieve and mislead.

So what am I going to do?

Absolutely nothing. She know where I stand, I have communicated my feelings for her in almost every way I know how. It is up to her to act on it now.

Before my journey towards 'proactivity' began I found myself very hurt that she was not giving me more of her precious little time. That somehow she owed me her attention because I NEEDED it. I see now that that is completely faulty. Being needy is what has gotten me into this mess. I will not burden her, or anyone else, with that any longer. I am going to keep on living, keep on moving forward with my life, and if she would like to include me in her last days here in Portland, I would be delighted to take part in that, and if she is too busy soaking in the people around her, hastily trying to have experiences she can hang on to while she lives her life in what she views as social alcatraz, then that is only human, and I cannot fault her for that.

But if not, then I have my answer, in a not particularlly messy way, and we can both move on. Either way, the situation is resolved, everyone has what they need to continue living, and at least on my end, there will be no hard feelings.

Even if I have not captured her heart, I have not failed in this experience. For after all, there is no failure...only feedback."

"event","Sorry for the past few incoherent entries. I haven't really been in the right mind set to narrative the events of my life over the past few weeks, it's all getting to be a little much.

But I have a lot to say and no one to say it to, so internet-ho!

I was talking to Nicole the other day (shut up, i know) and she revealed to me that Theresa had posted a bulletin on her MySpace pretty much saying her problems at home had come to a head with her guardian and her parents arranging for her to move back home in 2 months time.

Fuck. I couldn't believe it. I wouldn't believe it. It must have been an elaborate practical joke. It wasn't.

I frantically fired off a few tearful text messages for Theresa begging her to let me be with her before she left. Everything else didn't seem to matter. For a blissful, frightening second all my anxiety about her and us and where we were going and why she couldn't love me disappeared....and became replaced with NEW anxiety, that feeling of someone you care about being forcibly ejected from your life with no rational or logical explanation.

I went to Spiderman with butterflies in my stomach, but when I returned home she called me and we stayed up until the wee hours of the morning listening to each others' sobs. Creepy? Yeah, a little. Cathartic? Absolutely.

It all became clear for a while. I wanted-- no HAD to be with her, to support her through this terrible transitional period. I had to help her in whatever way I can. Because that's what friends do. Friends.....friends. OH right friends. I have no goddamn idea what a friend is or how they act. I just know how to like or not like someone. Isn't this just another elaborate ruse to cover up your true motives and trick her into liking you? For shame. I can't believe you'd sink THIS low.

What kind of a horrible monster am I? At a time like THIS, I still can't stop chasing unrequited love. You are in so far over your head you can't see where you came in. This is ridiculous. For so many reasons.

She's not in the right mindset to even think of serious romance right now, not to mention with you, no matter how nice of a guy you are, or how many of the right things you say. She is in social and emotional limbo. Everything isn't real. Nothing really matters. Soon it'll all be gone. If she was smart she'd use this opportunity to do all these things she ever wanted to do but couldn't; bitch out those annoying whores that bother her in between classes and at lunch, hook up with all those cute guys she's had her eye on all these years, say those things she's always meant to say to everyone but couldn't ever really bring herself to.

That's what you'd do, right? Go out with a bang?

No.

This is the way my world ends. Not with a bang, but with a whimper.

edit: i think im going to go watch voices of a distant star. i fear for my well being at this point.

edit2: oh my god i just cried myself to death holy shit what a beautiful movie

~*~

As I exhale, I think of questions to ask myself:
""What's your plan?""
""Do you think you're a man?""
""Has your little bit of success gone to your head?"""

I don't know why people make it so hard for themselves sometimes. I'm guilty of it too, I know. I see what would make me happy, identify the route to get there, and purposefully tarry so as not to achieve it.

I look at Theresa and her recent obsession with 'not hurting people'. An admirable goal to be sure, people that act without regard to the impact of their actions on the people around them are not people at all, but selfish monsters lacking in any sort of moral grounding.

There comes a point though in which good intentions become obsession and it interferes with your ability to exist in the world around you. In the end, you are not responsible for anyone's happiness but your own. <b>You cannot control the emotional states or nuances in the people around you, no matter how hard you try, or how smart you think you are.</b> When you speak or act there is an almost certainty that the intentions behind your words and deeds will become altered by the receiver's metal 'filters'. 

This brings me to an important point that <i>I</i> need to pay attention to and grasp fully:

To think that you can save people from what they do to THEMSELVES, no matter how delicately or thoughtfully you craft your words, is a fool's errand.

~*~

Just had to get some of that out of the way, for myself and the good of the order.

Post-Theresa update I guess. It's been a long time since I've written about her in a reflective, expository manner, largely because I haven't allowed myself a whole lot of time to dwell on this, worried that I may identify wrong-doings on my part and become wholly consumed by guilt and despair, and I really don't need that right now. Ignoring that, I seem to be doing alright though.

I can't lie and say I don't miss her. There is a part of me that now, really and truly, would like things to be the way they were, say, a year ago. I was expecting to find myself glad to be rid of her seemingly treacherous grip on my life at large, as I had convinced myself my interests in her were purely romantic, and I would languish in agony if she couldn't recognize me as a romantic being. But the fact that my thoughts are still often flooded by her lead me to suspect there was something really important there that I thoughtlessly threw away because it just HAD to be so dramatically 'black and white' with me, and that I couldn't have truly found happiness in any of the many shades of grey that exist.

I see her in the halls periodically, but I don't feel any of the anxiety or anger that I have felt in past instances where we were not speaking for extended periods of time. I see her and remember all of the good memories and feelings I've ever had about her and I want to smile. I want to wave. I want to say something. But I suppress it. I know that I can't do any of those things. They carry too much baggage. She averts her gaze and continues to walk before I have even processed the tragedy of the situation.

But then again, there is the part of me that knows that as things are the way they are, I really  couldn't bear to watch her ever be with anyone else. I guess that's a certain degree of my obsessive/control freak tendencies, but I know going through that one more time would destroy me. I guess that's why I wish she would have given me a chance. If we had gotten together and it had failed I wouldn't look on her other relationships as reflections of things I will never be good enough to attain, and more like what they actually are; temporary romantic pairings between 2 intrinsically flawed human beings who have coincidentally collided and lingered for a while before continuing their journies through life.

~*~

From up
High you look so lonely and
When I talk to you alone you'll think 
That guy he's the pick of the crop
And when you think about me, your heart will stop

So check the big times that got the heart of robot
Like the big guys, the body buildin' muscle men
And I can see why you'd pick them over me
They all got, big trucks, big subs, and I'm not 18

In 4 months I'll be one year away
But thats far too long, to wait I'm afraid
So go to the dirt bike track, pick you out a man
They might be riding all the time at least they have a career plan 

In 4 months
You'll be in college far away
And that's all I have to say"

"event","I'm getting some good, clear thinking done lately. It's great stuff and makes me wonder how I can ever view things as obsufcatedly as they seem to be some times.

The question I've been pondering today: why do I consistently go after the same types of women when it only ever ends in heartbreak, tragedy, and alienation?

There is something in me that likes to be a 'fixer'. Something of a 'knight in shining armor' complex that drives me to seek out...how do I put this delicately...non-traditional women, who have lived non-traditional lives (hey that wasn't half bad) and try to save them from, well...often, as it turns out, save them from themselves.

Part of it is, I guess, that I like to be the normal one in the relationship. These kind of relationships tend to be trickier to maintain, due to the finickiness of both parties involved, and have the appearance of being 'more interesting' than more normal, traditional ones, which, on its face, also tends to seem more appealing, as easily bored as I am.

But this seems at odds with other core values that I have; the belief that I am a human being of immense worth and deserve nothing less than exactly what I desire in a partner. Maybe I've just watched one too many bad high school teen drama movies where 2 amazing people collide and they find exactly what they were looking for, but I've always felt that at some point I will find that as well.

There is some sort of bizarre cognitive dissonance that exists between my desire for romantic intimacy of any kind (emotional or sexual) and my perfectionist, obsessive inability to accept anything less than absolute perfection.

So how do I reconcile that? In reflection, I've noticed that I tend to exaggerate the positive and undermine (and even sometimes blatantly ignore) the negative in whoever I am into at the time.

I'm feeling the same sort of disturbing revulsion that I felt when I got out of my relationship with Chelssy. That whole sort of 'what the FUCK was I thinking?' sense of failure and self-delusion. When you re-examine a person post-relationship and re-evaluate their qualities, there is bound to be some anger-induced bias/disparity in the perception between what you see now and what you thought you saw, but I am consistently overwhelmed with just HOW vast the disparity often is.

In retrospect, it seems almost TOO obvious. How could I have ignored so much in a vain attempt to gain so little?

Everyone told me 'dude, don't go there'. I ignored them. I told them they didn't know her like I did. I thought they were just jealous. They didn't want me to be happy.

Then she told me 'I can't believe you want to go there'. And what did I say? 'I don't care. It's not important. It is insignificant to the scope of these proceedings'. 

But it ISN'T. To say that how someone has acted in the past, how they are acting now, and how they will act in the future aren't at all related is just self-delusion in its purest form.

I really am the eternal optimist, despite my reputation. I give everyone I care about the benefit of the doubt, often at my peril, because of my belief in the power of love, as corny and completely out of character as it sounds.

There are so many things that seemed so small and insignificant at the time that I thought I could just let go, but they all stacked up, collapsed, and caught me in the undertow.

Maybe I need to reassess what I want in a partner. Try to figure out how to keep this sort of ridiculous bullshit from happening anymore.

Welp, I've got nothing but time. What DO I really want in a woman?

- Someone who understands and loves me for who I am
- Someone who I understand and I love for who they are
- Strong emotional connection between two dynamic people
- Intellectual and social stimulation

...is that really it? That seems so simple. Oh come on, you are such a liar. You didn't even mention 'pretty'. Don't pretend looks don't matter to you.

bare bones general obvious stuff:
- at least moderately physically attractive 
- good sense of humor, able to take it/dish it out
- doesn't abuse too many illegal substances
- no cheaters no cheaters no cheaters

I'm afraid to go any further because I can seem myself continuing this list FOREVER until I have nailed down THE perfect woman. Someone I will never be able to find. And that makes things seem so hopeless.

edit: you dont even want to know how long this list was in the first revision of this entry. good god i am a freak.

I guess I really just need to get over this notion of 'the one' and 'romantic perfection'. No one's perfect. I'm certainly not. Maybe if I can get more in the moment and not get caught up in  'completion' I can begin to truly appreciate people who aren't as perfect as I'd really like them to be.

Good talk."

"event","A moment of clarity. I love it when these just strike me. I REALLY have to hold on to this one too.

High School is almost over. 17 more days of turbulent adolescent melodrama, and then I am forcibly ejected into the real world. And you know, for the first time, I'm excited about this.

I'm going to enter a completely new echelon of romantic experience. I'm going to meet new women and I'm going to actually have to COURT them. No more of this 'harboring silent love for them for an extended period of time and then exploding on them'.

Because it isn't fair. It's all I've ever done.

I hate to get all '<a href=""http://www.intellectualwhores.com/masterladder.html"">ladder theory</a> all women are whores' about this, but I think a lot of it is pretty accurate, at least in a high school context. All I've ever done is climb to the tippy top of the friend ladder and hurl myself with reckless abandon across the abyss. Sometimes it works...sort of. Usually I'll fall short and just barely cling to the last rung. But that's something to me. I'll shout and be jubliant and exclaim 'I DID IT! I FUCKING DID IT! I MADE IT!' even as my pinky grasp slips and I begin to plummet. All the way down I am too destracted with my 'success' to even notice my impending doom. And then when I DO hit bottom all I can do is go, 'fuck. didn't see that one coming'.

But no more. I'm going to have to APPROACH women and ASK them out on dates and COURT them, in the traditional sense that I have evaded for so long.

It's always been scary to me. But it's so much more ethical than what I've been doing.

It wasn't right for me to tell Theresa how I feel. I ruined our friendship, for what? Some fleeting comfort that no longer having to carry a burden (that I am solely responsible for its creation) brings.

And what did I expect? I don't think that truly, in my heart of hearts, I expected for me to tell her I loved her, her to dump her boyfriend, for her to come to me, and for us to live happily ever after. And if I didn't REALLY believe that, there was no justifiable reason for me to do what I did.

So why did I do it? Is it some self-perpetuating cycle of me making decisions to reaffirm my cynicism and detachment from the world around me?

I fucked up. But it's for the last time. At least like this.

The future's looking a whole lot brighter. Good-bye, High School. You were the worst thing that ever happened to me."

"event","Prom pictures. I told myself I wasn't going to look at them, but I did. Fuck.

What is in a photograph? Why are people so fascinated with them?

They are fleeting moments, captured in time, and immortalized on Polaroid. They are so deceptive...so meaningless. What is true in those moments will never be true the next. They draw on empty nostalgia and desire for reminiscence to achieve...what? Hope for regression? To catalyze backwards momentum in life and maintain the status quo?

Memories are all we truly have, but to cheapen them into something as simple and meaningless as a photograph... It just seems unethical to me. My memories are mine and mine alone, locked securely in my brain...and the moment I stop forcing myself to remember and rely on a machine to do my remembering for me is the the moment I lose what little is left of my humanity.

Time marches on regardless...

Why do I get the feeling I'm going to hold on to these and treasure for them forever and become a Josh-Hartnett-From-40-Days-And-40-Nights obsessive stalkerazi creep?

Bah. Well, here are some of my favorites...we were pretty cute, regardless of the situation at hand...

I feel a lot more future-oriented. Almost like this experience was keeping me in the past. Suddenly graduation seems a lot more important. I feel more in control of my life. I feel comfortable with where I'm going.

I'm back to doing the things that I care about (as nerdy and stupid as they may be) rather than spending my nights waiting and worrying about what a girl thinks about me.

There still is some regret and remorse, but I've come to terms with them, I think. Mostly I'm just frustrated that this turned into ""Mallory part 2: no naked pictures edition"" but hey, shit happens. Next time it'll be different.

And I earnestly think there will be a next time. Someday I WILL find that special someone who can love me half as much as I love them. Until that day, there's nothing else to do but keep on keepin' on."

I received a text tonight. It filled me with dread even before I read it.

""Alright henry, im sorry but this is just too much. I realized that what i need and want right now, more than anything, is your friendship. I loved our friendship, it was different, and hard, and worth it every time it got hard. But that friendship isn't there, it isn't coming back and it probably never existed. So if you really can't do it, then maybe we just shouldn't try. I'm sorry we want different things and can't make this work.""

""Me too. But that's all I ever wanted you to say.""

""Don't be a stranger. If you ever need anything, i'm around. Thank u for everything.""

""You've already given me exactly what I need.""

""What's that?""

""Closure.""

I don't know. I guess this is what I wanted. To leave or be left. Good for her, I guess, for sticking to her guns when I could not. If I were here I probably would have given into me by now and given us a shot. But she didn't. I guess because she really couldn't see us ever working.

So that's it, then. This tumultuous period in my life is drawing to a close. 20 more days, and I can put this all behind me, and never ever remember.

I'm not thinking too clearly right now. I'll probably come back to this either later tonight or tomorrow once it's finally sunk in that it's for real this time.

Welcome love, I have made a place for you here
And I know every word they say
I don't want it want to make you change

Change if you want, but don't you go and change for me
I can love you as you are
I didn't mean to make you want to leave

In the fight between my heart and mind
No one really wins this time
No one really wins this time

If you don't find a love you want
If I have acted ungracefully
I don't want to see you go
I never meant to make you want to leave

Go if you want
Make your way straight to the door
I hope that you'll look back before you go
Cause grace looks back before it starts to leave

"event","I don't really have a witty intro to segue into my thoughts today. Nor an amalgam of poorly formated pseudo-poetry. It is, what it is I guess.

I WILL preface this entry, however, with some self-deprecation. An admission of humanity, if you will.

I have emotional and mental issues. Whether they are simply bothersome little neuroses or are the tragic effects of some neurological chemical imbalance, I cannot say for certain. I have staggering self-esteem issues which make me risk-averse the point of never trying anything or having any goals. I have fears of failure and rejection, both in my private, and romantic social life. I have crippling emotional problems which has lead to become unable to form any meaningful long term interpersonal relationships. I have problems with self-entitlement insofar as I am uncertain when bad things happen to me whether or not I should blame myself, and when good things happen, I feel undeserving of them. I act as though everything I have is worth nothing, and then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. I have recently come to realize that I have commitment issues. Not necessarily in a romantic pretext, but I find myself constantly having one foot out the door, ready to leave or be left, because of my cynical notions of time and the way world works, being perpetually prepared to have to start over with nothing.

I see all these things. I am trying to work on them.

ALL THAT BEING SAID, I think I'm doing better. I'm going after more things that I want. I'm trying riskier things. I'm becoming more uncomfortable with emotional uncertainty. I think the few friendships I have maintained through out the course of high school are stronger than they ever were. I am happy with my progress back to normalcy.

Normally, this is all I ever have to deal with. My own emotionally fragile, immensely complicated and neurotic brain functions. But things are different now. I have found someone else just like me. And I like them. A lot.

While this seems as though it is coming right out of a terrible FOX sitcom, it's true. My vision is beginning to become unclouded, and I'm beginning to perceive Theresa as having similar problems as I do.

Since 'the spring break massacre' as I have taken to endearingly refer to the incident and the following 'black monday', things have been tenuous and up in the air between us. Okay, we both have feelings for each other. We find each other at least sexually attractive enough to kiss. She sometimes was very intimate with me, emotionally and proximity-wise, other times, more distant and aloof. Sometimes she seems to despise her boyfriend, other time she seems to claim not to be able to live with out him. A natural balance of sorts, if I may hearken back to a previous LJ entry.

A sense of helplessness gripped me wholly for a time. The prize was within reach. I had said most of the right things and gone through most of the right motions and I was rewarded accordingly. But could I have my cake and eat it too?

I didn't know what to do. Before, in my earlier conundrums I could at least identify the choices and struggle over which one was the right one, but now I am blank. I have no idea what I can do to influence the situation. I know there is probably the one magical word that no one has heard before, that if it escaped my lips in the right tone, at the right time, in the right place, I could salvage this whole mess. I knew that. But what would that word be? How could I discover it?

It was troubling, leaving your romantic fate in the hands of a teenage girl. I never put myself on the line like this. So why now? What made this worth the terror and agony of waiting and wondering and doubting and crying?

The waiting game is the worst game of all, because no one really wins. If you have to wait for something, you're not going to get it. To play the game is to lose it. I moved quickly from helplessness to dispair.

Time flowed as it always does. Nothing really changed. Nothing concrete. Fragments of eternity here and there, but nothing to act as a foundation for a mature, rewarding relationship. ""It will come,"" I told myself, ""This too shall pass.""

Pass it did. No longer am I uncertain as to how she feels. I have it almost nailed down to a tee (i think).

Today, I had lunch with Theresa. It was a veritable emotional roller coaster.

We went to buy our prom tickets. It was fine, it felt good for both of us I think to get one more thing on the big ol' checklist-o-shit to do before prom comes done. We walk to QFC in the rain. I always like the rain. Everything seems so much more beautiful when it's wet to me, I'm not sure why.

Even her.

We split up in the grocery store. We like different things. I pay first, and wait outside for her. A few minutes pass. My stomach does the cold, churning thing. Is it a panic attack?

I get those sometimes. Usually only under extremely stressful situations. I've had 3 to date. Once before I lost my virginity, the second time when I was going to be late to final exams one school year because my bus broke down, and the third right before the SATs.

I don't know what panic attacks are like for other people, but for me they are absolutely terrifying. It starts first with the cold, churning stomach. Then your heart begins to beat faster and faster as worrying thoughts begin to fill your head. My face flushes beat red. I begin to sweat. But it is...cold. Cold sweat. My pupils dilate and my ability to perceive colors is sapped. Only amalgams of black and purple. Then I faint. And it's over as quickly as it started.

But why have a panic attack here? Outside a QFC? Theresa has only been in there a few minutes. What the hell is wrong with me?

But I never make the jump to stage two. The cold sweat never comes. Just a pervading sense of anxiety and animosity grips me. 

I watch Mr. Alvord, a teacher at Grant, pull up in his car and park in the handicap spot while he runs in and grabs something. His immaturity and irresponsiblity have always angered me. I make a silent vow to get his car towed. I will never follow through with it.

Moments later Theresa exits, and feigns an apology. The feeling doesn't subside. I resolve to forget about it. I comment on Mr. Alvord's behavior and make light of it to change the mood.

I fail.

I am assaulted with a diatribe about how I don't 'really know' Mr. Alvord. The implication being, I suppose, that I am too judgmental and condescending. I'm pretty sure he just parked in a handicap space, though. But what do I know.

It came out of left field. I stumble over my words trying to erect a defense for an attack I never could have seen coming.

""Stop arguing with me!"" She shouts.

And...just let you win? That isn't my style. I pull no punches. But I am too dumbfounded to even process the events unfolding around me. I stick to silence. Silence is golden. Silence is safe. Better to be silent and be thought a fool, than to speak and leave no doubt.

She seems to slowly become cognizant of her hasty behavior. She constructs something resembling an apology, but it's really more like an excuse. She's had a bad couple days. Why? She's been getting high at lunch and then skipping her classes because she's too fucked up to think straight.

I hate pot, for the record. I broke down and tried it once over spring break, and now I can say with first hand experience, pot is by the far the dumbest thing you can spend your time doing. I hate hanging out with people that are high. I hate it even more when people bitch about how doing it fucks with them. Just an exercise in retarded adolescent futility.

A months worth of bitter anger leaks out in a single venom-laced admission.

""I'm sorry you're having a bad day, but you kind of did it to yourself, so forgive me not being entirely sympathetic.""

And that was the last we spoke today. Silence, all the way back to school, except for the beautiful Portland rain.

~*~

It has been hard for me to deal with the mixed messages and conflicting emotions both within her and within myself. She has been pushing me away all week, and I'm not entirely sure what I've done wrong, except perhaps be a bit snippy here and there, but I feel I'm entitled to that much at least.

There's the part of me, watching all I've worked for crumbling down around me, that wants to frantically reach out and grasp the peices as they fall. Call her. Apologize. Do some more nice things for her without being recognized. Whatever.

But then there's the other part that is beginning to suspect something more dire. Maybe she isn't pushing me away because she's scared or she doesn't know how to tell me no, or she has decided that I'm not the kind of guy she wants to be with or whatever. I pray it is one of those things because acting shitty to person when you feel that way is an ENTIRELY HUMAN RESPONSE and I could identify with that and I could understand and I could forgive or ignore or tolerate or whatever I'd have to do to not let this bother me.

But it isn't that, is it? I think she wants us to happen, truly, in her heart of hearts, she thinks that it would be a good thing. But she is UNABLE to keep herself from destroying it. Maybe SHE was the one who was too vulnerable through out this whole ordeal. I was so wrapped up in my own insecurities I didn't even stop to think about how hard it was for her. Maybe she's finally snapped, the way I always worried I would. And she will kick and push and scream and drive me away to make sure our beautiful work of art never sees the light of day.

If this is the case, what can I do? I am powerless in every sense of the word. There is no one magic word to fix a chemical imbalance. I am completely at the mercy of her and my neuroses. I can pray they will work together and we will emerge through the crucible unscathed.

But who will hear my prayers?"

"event","I am angry.

Which in and of itself is odd. I don't generally get angry. I get mad sometimes, but it is fleeting and transitory and often immediately superseded by sadness.

Part of is that anger seems like such wasted emotional energy. Impotent rage, to me, is one of the most embarrassing expressions of humanity that a person could make.

And I guess the flipside to that is, I am overcome with the notion that everything bad that happens to me is deserved and I have no right to get angry about anything because it's all my fault and a product of my own design.

Tonight, is different, however, for some reason or another.

It all comes to a head a certain intersection, I suppose. The corner of Prom and Theresa.

So here's the skinny. Andrew and his fuckstick friends totally fucked us over. They went and worked out the whole getting the Limo deal without us, despite my REPEATED pleadings to PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE contact me when they got around to doing that because Theresa and I needed to get in on it and that money was NO OBJECT at all.

But of course, they are unreliable faux-friends who cannot truly be counted on for anything. But still, you'd have thought KYLA would have at least put her foot down or at least said something to them. I don't know.

So, here we are. No ride to prom, and no dinner plans Theresa says to me.

Alright. Fuck. We got fucked over. Badly. Alright. Time to come through at crunch time, just like you always do.

Within in five minutes of that conversation I had dinner reservations at a VERY nice 5-star restaurant downtown and an executive limousine (a VERY nice 1964 Bentley, no less) arranged to pick us up at her house. Great. Problem solved. Right? No.

It doesn't fit in with her plans. She has to do her hair. She wants to go hang out with her friends at dinner. She wants this and she wants that.

Look. It's too late for convenience. We thought we had it all worked out, I know, and we got fucked. I took fucking lemons and made the best goddamn lemonade I knew how to make, but it still wasn't good enough, was it?

I'm getting used to the whole 'me doing nice things for her and having it go WHOLLY unappreciated' shtick. That's not really what is bothering me. Well it is, but it was expected. If I didn't properly prepare myself for that outcome then I have no one to blame but myself.

The entire past few months has been me doing shit I don't want to do because it is what is right or it is what is needed or it what is expected and not getting so much as a 'thank you' for my efforts. I am tired of this. It needs to end.

This whole 'stoic, self-deprivation of pleasure' thing I have...created and internalized to deal with my recent series of uncomfortable situations was great for a while. It was great to feel righteously justified in feeling disraught, just under the surface where no one could see...But it's getting old. I don't want to do these things I think I have to do anymore.

And her dress. Good lord, her dress. Every minute it's about her dress. Why is this up to me again? Was it not YOU who chose to leave your mother fucking dress at 'my house' when you knew FULL WELL it is <i>not</i> MY HOUSE. I DO NOT LIVE THERE ANYMORE. There is no convenient time for me to pop in and go 'o hay guyz pickin up teh dress k thx bai'.

So what do I have to do tomorrow? I have to go to school. Then I have to bus to my mother's house. Pick up Theresa's fucking dress because it couldn't wait ANY LONGER because YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE IT TO BUY SHOES, IT IS A BIOLOGICALLY IMPERATIVE TRUTH, bus BACK to school with the dress awkwardly in tow, climb the god-forsaken Alameda ridge with it, give it to her, abruptly and angrily leave as the patheticness of the situation sinks in, walk DOWN to the max stop, and then get rewarded for my efforts with an hour-and-half long max ride to the middle of fucking no where.

Does she care? Not really. It's becoming quickly apparently that she really <i>doesn't</i> care, about me as a person, or us a potential romantic coupling. I'm just sort of an awkward social novelty that she can use when it suits her and order around when it doesn't.

Oh, I know Henry, but she really understands you. Boo-fucking-hoo. So she shows signs of emotional intelligence and perhaps fleeting desire not to cause emotional harm to other human beings. So she can see you are a (possibly) gifted linguist and some-the-times buys into your shitty emo rhetoric. Is that really what you want? Isn't what you TRULY long for a woman who sees that you have potential and talent BEYOND the ability to weave anecdote and clever turn of phrase into an embarrassing diatribe about the trite nature of your life and interpersonal relationships and DOESN'T settle for all that bullshit and actually motivates you to BE someone? (OH THE IRONY IT IS OVERWHELMING)

Yes. Yes it is.

I know sometimes you just want someone you can hold at night so you don't have to sleep alone. Someone who is as tragically beautiful and broken as you see yourself, someone you can whisper your sweet songs to in the dead of night, your emotions unclouded and unobfuscated by hesitancy and doubt, the way only truly gifted lyricists can bring them to the world. Sometimes the beautiful poetry you weave in your own head to justify both the end and the means makes the here and the now seem ephemeral, but at a certain point you have to protect yourself from this sort of bullshit.

I'm worried. I can feel my armor slowly righting itself, it's durability restored, even stronger than before, perhaps. I had my week or so of intense vulnerability, things did not work out the way I liked, and I am now worse off than when I started."

it wouldnt be the end of the world
there's so much more than you and me
and the lonely position of neutral
it's not so bad
you're only the best i ever had

this is you being selfish
this is you feeling sorry for yourself

people like me like to emphasize the distinction between being 'alone' and being 'lonely'
the two are not mutually inclusive
when you live life a certain way for so long
there is a certain amount of comfort in being alone
feeling the vast emptiness in the space between you and me
there's something familiar there

how then can i make the change without giving up everything that i am

~*~

here is a song i wrote:

Sweetness can rot your teeth
An idea can shake a belief
No words can withstand the test of time
You say as I recall the day you became mine

I don't believe it
How could you do this to me
How does it feel to use me
You say you never loved me
I don't believe it

Another lie escapes your lips
Malice wrapped up in tenderness
An empty promise that things will change
Now we're through but one word remains
Someday

I don't believe it
No, not for a minute
How does it feel to lie
And know I see right through it

I don't believe it
I thought I was the one
The one to whom you'd run
But now you say we're done
I don't believe it

Why does have to be this way
The words you hear but never say
Will comeback to haunt you
Someday"

drawn inexorably to the small brass gateway
so small but so powerful
so useless on its own save for what we place on either side of it
a divider between what we welcome and what we shun
but in this moment
so small and fleeting
but so beautiful and perfect
they are one

dot your is and cross your ts
it is what is required
sign the lovers' pact in blood so that no amount of time will fade it

in exchange, a small, modest package labeled 'handle with care'
branded 'fragile' by someone who thinks they understand what they are sending
but in truth only the object knows itself truly
hidden in its protective box, protected
and it only has a frame of reference in terms of the other packages
much larger, and grander

'do not drop'
who are you to disobey my markings

it happens quickly, violently
the protective layer of cardboard lost to the onslaught
its human nature to increase entropy when given the opportunity
the receiver is too eager to see what secrets the box contains
besides a healthy layer of packing peanuts and bubble wrap
it lies silently
awaiting its judgment

but it's never what you dreamt it might be
what were they thinking, sending you this useless trinket
good intentions, to be sure

what is the occasion
what made this worth giving

"event","Things are different now.

Maybe the best part about lying is the truth you will inevitably be forced to tell when you've told a thousand more lies, each more poorly crafted and brittle than the one immediately proceeding it.

~*~

An arm's length between our trembling lips, but it is enough to riven everything that I now hold dear.

There is so much space between us.

I reach out and touch you to shake off the feeling of separation anxiety. It grips me fully and I am too paralyzed with fear and anxiety to hold you tightly and tell you, ""Here is everything I've ever wanted to say,"" even though there is that small part of me that knows we will never see each other again. Not like this. Not in the naive light of carefree young love where only the now and the here matter.

The bed's gone cold, but we are still on it. Touching, caressing, exchanging body heat. Our chests rise and fall in rhythmic symphony, followed by fevered breaths exhaling in a bittersweet cacophony. I count the beats as I run the inside of my thumb up your forearm. They are irregular, and non-standard. Just like me. Just like you.

I haven't even left your side yet and I already feel the pain of absence.

~*~

Sorry, just had to get that out. Orphaned thoughts with no home tend to grow malignant over time.

What's going on with my life? I'll have to provide some context for the above ramblings. I let Theresa know how I feel. For better or for worse.

I did it in an amazingly pussy way. I showed her the LJ entry preceeding this one where I get all creepy and stalkerazi about her. It was a little worrisome, but she seemed genuinely touched by my words, or perhaps just surprised at the type of emotion and thoughtfulness I am capable of.

She told me she has feelings for me too, whatever that may mean. We are both uncertain as to our future.

We gave the whole intimacy thing another try. It was as glorious and perfect as I remember. Even better without the biting sense of futility and desperation! Her skin and lips are so soft, her body is so warm, when I hold her I feel that sense of completion and contentment I have dreamed about for as long as I knew that was something you could find in the arms of another human being.

The seemingly only two obstacles for us to overcome now are a) time and b) her boyfriend.

Time is the tricky bit. How much time will she need to make the full switch from viewing me as Jerky Pseudo-Friend Henry to Romantic Possibility Henry? How much more time can I wait before I go insane? Will this get resolved before Prom? Or will things be the same at that time and Prom be fraught with even more emotional precariousness than it seemed as thought it would oiriginally?

Her boyfriend is a simple problem, but not one that has a simple solution. She either has to dump him, or tough it out.

Perhaps the fact that she hasn't dumped him yet is sign enough that this will not work out. Perhaps it's a sign of hesitancy in the face of change and the desire to stick with the evil you know over the evil you don't.

I want her to be happy. Maybe we had our brief moment in eternity where we truly connected. And saw each other for what we truly are. Two lost, romantic souls, hopelessly wandering. Maybe that was all we'll ever get.

I still wouldn't trade it for the world.

Her words mirrored mine as I left today. I grasped her face in my hands as I leaned in, again unable to fight off the urge to kiss her any longer...and she pushed me away.

""I can't,"" she said.

Neither can I."

"event","Well hello there livejournal! How are you, my old friend? It's been a long time.

I'm getting increasingly more comfortable with the idea of not using this thing except when I have an assload of emotional baggage and no one to unload it on to.

Well, I'm here, so you know what that means. Set course for shitty teenage drama.

Where to begin.

Theresa spent the night at my house last night. I picked up from the train station and brought her back to my place where we met up with Keenan, Max, and Grace and had a blast playing drunken Wii. This went on for some time without incident.

Then our guests left and it was just me and Theresa. I was already pretty drunk at the time. Not too drunk to remember things, but drunk enough to be emo and honest. A deadly combination, to be sure.

We started watching TV, and I was sprawled out on the couch about ready to hit the hay, despite my hopes for something to 'happen' between us. Sure enough something DID 'happen'. I rue the day I ever set eyes on this girl.

After a few minutes of the Daily Show, she crawled up to where I was laying on the couch and put her head on my chest and laid down next to me.

""I thought you didn't want a cuddle buddy,"" I remarked, a throwback to an earlier comment I made about us sleeping in different beds that night.

""Cuddling is fine,"" she cooed as she tightly gripped my torso.

It was beautiful. I was so happy. Long had I silently waited in the corner as Theresa went through traumatic relationship after traumatic relationship constantly shaking my head and whispering quietly to myself, ""Why not me?"" Finally, my patience and perseverance had finally paid off, or so it seemed.

I slowly wrapped one arm around her and let the other come to rest on her head as I began to play with her hair. So soft...so beautiful...

She begins to giggle and remarks that her mother used to do the same thing to her when she was a kid. I smile and pretend to take offense as I pull my arms back. She grabs it and wraps it around her waist. Her body heat permeates my entire being, filling me with a serene sense of of completion.

Being Henry, the first question that comes to mind is: how do I ruin this?

I smile and whisper in her ear, ""I hate you so much right now.""
She turns her head and looks over her shoulder to reply, ""Cuddling is fine. We're not doing anything wrong if we just cuddle.""

JUST cuddle? This means the world to me. Every time I see you I have to fight off the urge to grab you and press your body against mine and tell you nothing will ever hurt you again while I entangle you in an embrace you are never allowed to be removed from.

But that's not what she meant. She meant just CUDDLE. As in, only cuddling. Nothing else.

I am not a bad man. However, I am A man. I have urges. You put me in immediate proximity of an extremely attractive girl I have long since had unrequited feelings for me and tell me cuddle is the only avenue available to me? This is going to be end terribly.

I am overcome with a feeling of anger. Indignity that I am merely cuddlebitch material. I pull away once more as I say, ""I can't do this.""

She again returns my hands to the warmth of her body. It feels so right. How could this be wrong?

""Theresa, I can't. This isn't right.""

""I'm trying to be a good girl. Young--""

I don't hear the rest of her words. Just 'young'. What kind of name is 'Young'? A..A...A stupid name that's what!

She drones on and on about her pseudo-boyfriend, the aptly named 'Young'. How could she possibly choose a mere sophomore over ME?!

Her grip on my arm begins to feel faintly like daggers. I wrest my arms from her grasp and begin to pull them back by head. I need some distance. Too much exchange of body heat is making me dizzy. I'm still pretty drunk.

She turns her body towards me and buries her face in my neck.

""Please. Just don't think about it.""

She is so beautiful and perfect and even if she hurts me like everyone says it will have been worth it to not have to spend the rest of my life wondering what if.

I grip her tightly letting my hands explore the small of her back. Her breathing begins to intensify. Is she hot? She should take off her clothes... Oh god, what are you saying.

I leap back, nearly violently pushing her off the couch in revulsion.

""I...I'm sorry. I just can't.""

""Henry, please...""

She looks at me with her big beautiful eyes. I reach out and move her hair out of her face.

""Am I beautiful?""

Her question goes through the usual cynic filters. Is it a trick? What will she get out of asking this question? I am suddenly overcome with a desire to be honest. This is a perfect opportunity to say all the things I've ever meant to say.

""I think you are very beautiful.""

""Like a traditional pretty? Or a sad girl pretty?""

Definately sad girl.

""When I look at you...I see your obvious exterior beauty. But I can tell...there is also beauty inside. In your secrets and thoughts. I want to learn them all...because they are all an equal part it.

Not exactly the most sensible, or eloquent but hey, I'm drunk.

She is taken aback. ""For someone who doesn't want to snuggle with me, that's very romantic.""

I am modest. ""I was just trying to answer your question.""

I feel I made progress. A step closer to honesty at least. We re-engage our embrace and things are perfectly serene for a moment.

And then she speaks. Venom practically drips down her cheeks as she surgically lays out her concerns.

""You can't tell Kyla about this.""

What?! WHY?! Because you are ASHAMED of being seen with me?! Because who in their right mind would possibly CONCEIVE of being intimate with Henry Demarest. A whore, right? That is what you are saying aren't you. Indignant rage boils to the surface again, but I supress it modestly.

""...Alright.""

She has no fucking idea what this is doing to me. To be doing something so beautiful and perfect but knowing it will DESTROY you. I feel nothing while writing this. My soul has been tapped. In the 30 minutes or so of close physical intimacy she took everything I had left. She is strong, I am weak. Until she lets me get close. Then I get weaker.

""Why is this hard for you?"" she asks inquisitively while I am lost in thought.

""I...I have a lot of...moral and ethical quandaries to ponder.""

""What do you mean?""

""Like...whether it is right to be doing this with you...because of how I feel.""

Good. GOOD. You are so close. You can't NOT say it now.

""How do you feel?""

An opening. It is vast and all consuming but there it is. Now is your time. I part my lips and whet them to brace for the verbal diahrrea that is about to be spewed forth.

""Nevermind, I know what you're going to say...and I don't want to hear it.""

She knows. She knows. ABORT. ABORT.

Wait, it's more complicated than that. She is torturing you knowing FULL WELL of how you feel. She is ignoring your emotions and using you. Playing you like a proverbial instrument.

A tear trickles down my cheek as the first real shred of honesty escapes my lips.

""You...are a selfish girl.""

I feel her face muscles contort into a smile on my neck. ""I know.""


~*~

It's a blur after that, folks. I remember getting up to go the bathroom, coming back and finding her visibly distraught. Either she kept drinking or sobered up enough to realize what she has done to me.

""Are you mad at me?""

""At you...no. I'm mad at myself for letting this happen.""

Her gaze drops. ""Do you want me to leave?""

no no no NONONONO I never want you to leave I want you to stay with me forever please don't leave me you're all I have

""No, I don't want you to leave.""

I am disgusted with both her and myself. I excuse myself outside to have a smoke. I begin to chuckle as the cool night air washes over me. Slowly, but surely, the laughter turns to sadness. I fall to the ground and begin to weep openly. I don't know why. 

I hear a faint 'oh, god' from inside the house. Theresa rushes outside and steadies me.

""Henry, I'm so sorry. I'll never snuggle with you again.""

I man up and steel myself. She can't see me like this.

""So you're punishing me?"" I muse.

""It seemed like doing it was the punishment.""

You're sending her mixed signals! She is trying to do what you want but YOU don't know what you want. You are so fucked up in the head, good god what is wrong with you. Man up, grow a pair, and fuck her on your parent's bed like a man.

""Not at all.""

She is extremely apologetic for the rest of the night and things are amazingly awkward. Her boyfriend calls and I use this opportunity to excuse myself to sleep. 

No sleep tonight. I sit in my desk chair and listen to music. I am restless. Theresa pokes her head in after a few minutes and tells me good night. She comes over and gives me a simple, friendly, hug. I am struck by the lack of warmth hugs have. I am unresponsive. She goes into my room and climbs into my bed. After I hear the light go out I plummet to the ground. More tears. Unexpected this time. No happy interlude. Just sadness and dispair.

I somehow at last found sleep.

When I woke up, it was 8:30. I went down to wake Theresa; she had somewhere to be early in the morning. Presumably her boyfriend's house. I will be the stoic gentleman and do what's right. Letting her sleep past her arrangement would be a dickish thing to do.

We sit on the couch while we check the bus schedule. Next one comes in 30 minutes. We wait. Silently.

She moves over to my computer and plays a song for me. 'Forgotten Not Forgiven' by Just Surrender. As the song nears the chorus, I turn my gaze to her, and she locks hers with mine. She mouths the words of the song.

promise me
you'll forget me
you said as you walked away
don't hold on, please
let go of me
you make it so hard to leave

I am overcome with a desire for her happiness. My emotional neuroticisms stop mattering. She is the only thing that does to me anymore. I reach out and grab her and press my body against hers like I've always wanted to. She is compliant. She is as soft and warm as I remember...

Then she pulls away. She has a bus to catch. To go to her boyfriend's house. The hard reality of the situation sinks in as I walk her down the hill to the bus stop. It's hopeless. She gets on and I turn around, masking the forming tears. So much regret. So much dispair.

As I write this I feel nothing anymore. Only a vast consuming emptiness. She took the last good part of me last night. But if it had to go...I'm glad it's with her.

You were right guys. You were right."

"event","Hey everyone.

Guess what I did today? I commited a cardinal sin; a crime against everything which I hold dear. I made a myspace. I feel terrible about it, but at least Kyla and Theresa can't parade around on that fake myspace they made 'for me' and leave mean comments on other people's myspaces and leave me to get in trouble for it anymore!

Whatever. I've had it for like a day and have already spent far too much time on it. That shit's addictive. Oh, if you're my friend or something I guess I should probably give you my myspace link thingy: http://www.myspace.com/angstandavarice

At least there's no annoying 'internet quiz' things or stupid youtube videos no one cares about. And it's not entirely offensive to the eyes. Whatever.

I don't know if I want to go out on too big of an emo tangent right now because I actually feel pretty good right now. I mean, my life still sucks something fierce and every day seems to get harder and harder but right at this moment I feel pretty docile. Never thought I'd be making an LJ post on how non-upset I am!

Maybe I'll just give a brief overview of why my life sucks right now:

1) Chasing a girl who doesn't care about me
2) Unable to grow up
2a) No job
2b) No car
2c) No friends
3) Future is looming
3a) No grades
3b) No college
3c) No ambition
3d) No idea what i'm going to do with my life

Maybe I will elaborate a little more on some of these key aspects later but for right now I'm just going to not worry about it all too much.

Later"

"event","I feel like writing/talking a little tonight and so I have decided to revisit this old haunt of mine and throw up some feelings onto this page and then probably abandon it until the next time I desire correspondance and then recall that I have no friends with which to engage in such an exchange.

Neat.

Anywho, what an emotionally turbulent couple of weeks I've been having. Mostly usesless dramatic teenage emo bullshit, I know, but still. Seems like I'm having a a prolonged streak of...at the very least...bad luck.

If you haven't heard/care/whatever, all that stuff with Mallory that was putting an extra kick in my step for a while there fell through and I really took that harder than I probably should have, because I really needed her to pull through and like me or whatever just for the sake of my ever-rapidly decreasing self esteem. I made a rather large emotional investment in her that may have, in hindsight, been unfair to her, but in any case it's hard to look back on the whole thing and not feel like I got burned by her.

I don't really want to talk anymore about that, though. I've said my piece to many different people, many times and I mostly just feel like a jackass for not seeing what was coming sooner.

Let's talk about the more recent.

Girl-wise, more precariousness. Set course for long-winded, pretentious, ego-stroking block of text, warp 5.

A week ago, Chelssy Allen had a party at her house one night because her parents were out of town. A spent the day hanging out with her, Kyla, Theresa, and Max downtown and then we all agreed to go hang out at Chelssy's. Max had to go to work, Theresa had to go home and do some chores, and Kyla had to go home and check in with her parents, so it was just gonna be me and Chelssy. On the way back to Chelssy's house, Chelssy called this girl, Brittany Rush, and invited her to the thing that night. I had had a thing for Brittany for a bit of junior year which ultimately climaxed with her spending the night at my house one night, me being a total gentleman and not taking advantage of her, then immediately regretting my decision, and blowing the situation out of proportion when I retold the story to people in the following days. We had agreed to keep in touch over the summer, but that didn't really pan out. She stopped talking to me, which I took as a sign that we were through, and I, in what I consider(ed) one of my more mature and intelligent decisions, let her go out of my life with relatively little social and emotional consequence. I had virtually all but finally forgot about her (due in no small part to Mallory's 'interference'), and hearing her name from Chelssy's voice did send a tingle down my spine...although I did not feel as awkward about potentially seeing her as I probably should have.

Brittany ended up agreeing to come hang out with us, and shortly after Kyla and the rest had dropped us off at Chelssy's, she showed up. I had already reverted to cave troll status and made up for lost beta radiation by blasting music out of Chelssy's computer and reading about whatever random crap I could find on the internet. When Brittany showed up she shambled downstairs into the basement where we were lounging and gave me a hug as I didnt even turn to greet her. Idle chitchat later she and Chelssy had retired to the couch and I returned to the computer. I paid no attention to them because they were busy being pseudo-lesbians/girl talking/whatever but after a time I noticed their voices had dropped to a whisper, followed by giggles. I began to get a little nervous as I felt a seemingly malevolent entity creep up behind me. As soon as I was able to determine it was Brittany, I felt a soothing, slippery warmth on my neck and ear. My eyes rolled into the back of my head and I just sat there awkwardly in my computer chair, unsure if I was dreaming or not, as this very attractive girl, that I had lusted after for some time just slobbered all over my neck.

After a period of time that seemed like forever, she let up and I practically melted out of the chair. She said to Chelssy, ""Wow, you were right. He does have an ear-thing,"" and they both giggled.

Before I knew it I was sitting on the couch between them, and one thing lead to another, and I quickly found myself in the midst of the seemingly hottest threesome ever. I'll spare you the specifics, in the interest of keeping myself as emotionally detached from the situation as possible, but also to keep this journal less at least...semi-clean.

After that...<i>happened</i>...the others began returning to Chelssy's (several half-crying telephone calls to Theresa from myself, later) and things began to...normal out. Although in the brief moments in between rooms and groups of people that Brittany and I found ourselves alone, we could not seem to keep our hands off each other...In between a kiss she mused, ""this has been a long time coming""...I was not sure if she meant for me or her, but I guess it didn't really matter...I replied, ""it was worth the wait.""

And it was. I finally had her. And I barely had to work for her!

The night continued, Max got off work and came back to hang out with us and everyone (less myself, and Mira, one of Chelssy's random camp friends that she had conjured out of thin air) got high. I spent most of the evening making sure no one hurt themselves or burned down the house, as well as chasing Brittany around the house, trying to get her to calm down. At times she seemed visibly upset and distressed, which I assumed was at least MARGINALLY, my fault, but for some reason this didn't scare me off. I wanted to be with her, and I would face whatever emotional garbage that meant I had to. We talked A LOT while she was blazed. About a great many things. Her family, her love life, heh... and my psychological state. She asked me if I loved her. I wasn't sure how to respond, but I thought I would err on the side of overstating and I told her ""I think I might...""

Then she began to cry. She said something about how she hurts everyone that loves her, and I told her that even if she did hurt me, I would still want something to happen between us.

All-in-all the night was very hectic but by far very emotionally (and physucally) rewarding. We spend the night in Chelssy's bed and I will leave it up your imagination what happened thusly.

The next morning I had to leave super early to work so I had snuck out of Chelssy's room early in the morning and crashed on the couch so my alarm wouldnt wake her...but when it did I knew I couldn't leave without saying goodbye. I woke her up and we spent a short while together, and as I left I was sure I had forged a meaningful relationship with a woman I cared about and left feeling like I had finally done something right in my romantic life.

The next day at school I saw her in the halls out of pure chance and rushed up to her. Our gaze met and I knew I had to try to kiss her. She complied and I was so happy she had not broken down into regret during our time apart. I spent the rest of the day on cloud 9...until I got a call from her that night. Theresa had come to my house after school to hang out, but she was fast asleep on my couch when Brittany called.

She was very surgical with her words. She told me that she 'really wasn't looking for a boy right now', having just been emotionally wrecked in a relationship with 'Nathan', the boy who had caused me to stay my proverbial hand that night she had spent the night at my house. I asked if there was any way to reconcile that, and she simply replied 'by not having one'. I let her bulldoze me because I was still so happy at what we had...I offered no struggle. I told her that I had hoped she would not regret what we had done and she confirmed that this was not the case. She told me she would keep me posted if her 'situation changes' (whatever that means) and we said our goodbyes.

And that was that. I've been waiting for a week now. I intermittently text her every now and again when I think I am a fool for letting her get away, and she, for her part, indulges my obsession. She makes it clear however, her life has not been altered by this chance encounter. Not like mine has.

I am exhausted now, but I feel like this was worth the time it took to write. I will hopefully regail you some more tomorrow with why life sucks right now."

"event","Holy cow! Has it really been a WHOLE YEAR since I last updated this motherbitch? Well it clearly had much longer a run than I think any of us had ever dreamed it could.

So let's recap what all has happened. 

Nicole broke up with me. Twice. Yes, that's right, she broke up with me, and I started dating Mackenzie again for a short while (yeah, I know, I'm a tard), then <i>Mackenzie</i> broke up with me for Ian, and then Nicole asked for me back. Then she broke up with me again over the summer. I've seen her at random intervals every once and a while, we both seem to still care deeply about each other, but know it will just never work.

This year (my junior year) I've gone out with one girl, Chelssy, and that ended pretty poorly as well.

Still doing pretty poorly in school, but I've basically resolved to do EXCELLENT next year, so we'll see.

I was having some more girl troubles today and my good friend Cassidy and I began discussing live journal, so I thought that I would christen this blog with an entry about how much I love her.

Top 10 Things about Cassidy Slaughter-Mason

"event","Oh man, it's been like a week since I've updated! Could that mean my life is returning to normal?!

It's remarkable, but apparently true. Nothing dramatic/tragic/gutwrenching has happened lately, despite my best efforts to mess up my own life by whatever means nessecary.

What have I been up to?

I've been playing Arcanum like a motherfucker, holy shit that game has got to be the best RPG ever. It's just got everything. Please, ask me to burn a copy of it for you, I want as many people as possible to enjoy this epic game.

I've been playing it pretty much all day after school for the past few days... Since Arcanum takes over the whole screen Trillian doesn't pop over it so I've missed Nikki about 6 times in the past 3 days. I think she thinks I'm ignoring her or something...she seems pissed off. Her sister apparently IMed me while I was playing and relayed a message that I was a dick for not calling her Friday since it was our 3 month anniversary.

NEWSFLASH: Nobody cares!

Honestly, what the fuck does a 2 month anniversary mean when you've only spent about a dozen hours together? I have no idea. I'm begining to think maybe I should just ignore Nikki until she gets back in control of her own life, cause I really don't wanna have an internet-only relationship. That's about the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.

It bothers me that I'm not festering emotionally as much as I thought I would be, I mean its been...what...a month since I've seen her? And I haven't once yet broken down into tears/thrashing because I am so desperately alone in the world. I guess a relationship really doesn't equal happy. 

Arcanum equals happy!

But I am a hypocrite -- I am abstainig from playing Arcanum so I can catch Nikki next time she gets online and apologize prefusely for not having my priorities in order. I am such a tool.

Speaking of which, the leaked singles for NIN's new album, With Teeth, are the dumbest songs I've ever heard. Honestly, they're just utter shit. Trent Reznor has been doing coke for the past 2 years and finally realized it was time for a new album so he's just randomly churning out what ever garbage he can record and trying to pass it off as 'art'.

New Adema CD leaked too, and uh...it's the strangest thing I've ever heard. They got rid of their old lead singer (much to my dismay) and replaced him with someone...who doesn't sound like an angry rich white boy, which pisses me off, cause Adema was my angry white boy band. Oh well, I still have their old stuff to trash to.

Well, that's all for now I guess. I'll let you know if I have a sudden mood swing or something."

Been hard at work all day, puttin' in doors and working with power tools. No sense of accomplishment, though. Just more of the same.

Nikki called and rescued me from it, though. But I now I wish she hadn't. She said she might be able to find a way to get out of the house this weekend, and I was so pissed that after all this time of me begging her she hadn't said that she thought there might be a chance...and so now I have some hope in my heart that can only get crushed, inevitably, after I had already resigned to never see her again.

I feel like I want her out of my life until we can actually commit to each other, instead of the sort of 'i'll see you whenever' bullshit mentallity we have going on right now. This is just dumb.

And of course she pulled her usual 'if you don't entertain me I'm gonna hang up angrily' shit on me. If there is one thing I hate about her, it's that. She calls up and when you're not being talktative she practically holds herself hostage.

I might get to go home tomorrow, though. So that would be nice."

3 weeks of Algebra homework to do over the weekend, and a nice long Chemistry lab.

I can feel myself seperating more and more from everyone around me. My relationships with people are dissolving faster and faster all the time. I seriously would kill for just one good friend to talk to. I wonder why I don't have one...

Gonna have to help my father move this weekend. Lots of packing things, cleaning up, etc. Good home skills.

Talked to Nikki yesterday, on the phone no less...it sucks, it reminded me how much I miss that girl. I feel like we should break up or something until she gets ungrounded because its so painful to talk to her, knowing that this very weekend she will be less than half a mile away from me, but I will (most likely) not be able to see her.

I think there might be a chance I could go over to her house and see her if I bond with her parents a bit. I'm sure her mom will have some great things to say to me (remember that Nicole has told her mother that we are having sex, so I have been too afraid to show my face around them lately)... But frankly, I'd endure anything just to get to touch another human being again...

I'm a mess.

Oh, Me, Colin, and Chris are going to see Constantine on Monday. If anyone else is interested in tagging along, gimme a holler. Afterwards, we will return to my abode and play the video game to compare. It'll be fun, I'm sure.

Spent Valentine's day desperately alone. Watched the notebook like Nikki told me to. She didn't even call.

She called tonight. Talked for a little bit and it was good for a while. Then I mentioned I smoked a cigarette (and this was probably contributing to the disgusting cough I had while talking to her) and she freaked out and gave me a lecture on how cigarette smoking was bad and how I was a communist asshole for doing it. I tried to explain that I was doing it because I do not like the taste of Alchohol and Druggies (like her, it seems) are the lowest common denominator and are appaul me, so cigarettes are the only vice option I have left.

Her: ""Do you know how fucking bad it is to get a craving in the middle of class?!""
Me (jokingly): ""No, but I hope to find out!""
...
Me (seriously): ""Do you?""
Her: ""Yes.""

Apparently she's an ex-smoker and has since moved on to pot. When she started berating me I went 'oh dont even lecture me you dru--' and I caught myself, but you could practically hear 'Druggie' ring through the line.

Her: ""Yeah well pot is WAY better for you than cigarettes.""

DEFENDERS OF POT UNITE! YEA VERILY THE GATEWAY DRUG OF THE MASSES THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A RIDICULOUSLY HIGH FATALITY RATE EVERY YEAR IS BY FAR THE BEST CHOICE OF VICE.

She succeeded though, now that I know she has dominated that realm of human fuck uppery I do not want to ever put a cigarette in my mouth ever again. In fact, I'm going to go throw away my stash right now."

Thursday night, supposed to be at my Dad's house, instead I get ambushed cause he got my report card a few days before my Mom did. Clearly the only viable explanation for this is that I have raided the mail and made off with my report card to keep it from my parents. It did not help my case that I got /straight/ Bs, except for a /C/ in health (oh man I am a smarty) and a D in Chemistry (I even got a B on the final...what the christ?).

So instead of enjoying a nice evening at my father's home I instead am treated to a long talk about how I have no ambition in life and am wandering aimlessly, how I am a terrible human being, how I am most likely clinically depressed, and how, if I do not improve my grades, I will be sent to Military School in the fall.

"event","God damn, this shit is getting ridiculous. I would like my life back, please. You know, one where I didn't have to deal with all this shit?

Honestly. 2 Months ago my top priorities were video games and anime. Now I have to worry about drugs and sex. What the fuck happened, guys?

Today was pretty good, school wise. Wednesday blocks are always my favorite. Rane was here today (he skipped out yesterday) so I missed him (read: missed having someone to bitch to).

Last night I finally got to talk to my dad about what happened. He couldn't get over the fact I wasn't outraged that Nicole was doing drugs with a circle of people that included her ex-boyfriend.

Marc: ""People that do drugs usually have sex afterwards, Henry.""

The thought of Nicole and Aubrey <i>ever</i> having sex just makes me want to belly laugh. I trust her that much, at least.

He brought some scientific facts to my attention, such as the fact that Marijuana cannot be laced with E under any circumstances because you cannot grind it up, light it on fire, and get off from it. Chemically, that is just impossible. The only thing that her pot could have been laced with was Meth.

Apparently she knows this. When I talked to her this afternoon, she seemed to know everything I had to say to her.

And now for some chat log action:

Her: soooo....why are you blamming kristine???
Me: I don't blame Kristine directly. I don't think she did this to you, although it is a possibility.
Her: why would she of all ppl give me all that crap?
Me: I don't know, but it /is/ a possibility
Her: no its not
Me: ...why?
Her: because kristine would never do that
Me: before this weekend the thought would never have crossed my mind either, but EVERYONE is a suspect unless there is something you're not telling me, a reason you KNOW Kristine could not have done this
Her: no....none of those ppl in that car would have given me any of those drugs
Her: are u accusing me of lieing?

I guess I am. What else I can I do? The evidence is so overwhelmingly stacked against her...

What evidence you say? Excellent question!

Me: During my research last night I was trying to figure out how all of those drugs could have possibly gotten into your system via smoking pot
Me: the only answer (and I looked in MANY places) is that it is impossible. Some of those drugs could /not/ have been combined in marijuana
Me: E for instance, E is a designer drug as I'm sure you're familiar with and is generally taken in pill form
Her: i know that. 
Me: it is not physically possible to /grind up E/, /light it on fire/ and /get off from it/
Me: I have been lead to believe that that simply, on the chemical level, will not work
Her: the only thing the pot could have been laced with is meth...
Her: i know all this already
Me: then I won't go on. Can you at least see why I am skeptic?
Me: The peices don't go together
Her: no because you are supposed to believe me.

I'm just supposed to believe her? I'm just supposed to suspend rational thought & logic just because I love her? I wish I could. I really wish I was that naive.

Me: I know. I know. I am sorry. I truly and honestly want to believe you, and until I learned all this stuff myself I really and truly did.
Her: and now you dont?
Me: But the fact that A) no one told me most of what happened is actually impossible and B) the fact that...no one has a reasonable explanation for what happened is making me faith waver
Me: do you have any possible reasonable explanation for what happened
Her: NO i dont. im tired of ppl asking me that. why the fuck do you all think i was so freaked out? I would have NEVER done any of those drugs (becides pot) and even if my some chance that i would have....i wouldnt have mixed them. 
Me: Alright. That is fair.
Her: but you still dont believe me so odviously i am waisting my breath
Me: please let me finish
Me: I can understand you are upset with me for not just automatically believing you, but this is a serious issue to me and I just want to know everything.
Her: well you know everything there is to know. you know as much as any one in the fucking van.
Me: If you tell me right here and now that everything you have told me is 100% accurate and there is nothing being kept hidden, then I will believe you. I honestly and truly will.
Me: i told you everything that happend
Her: and i am sick and tired of defending myself
Me: Alright. Then I believe you.
Me: I am so sorry for having to put you through this
Me: but I just don't know what else I can do to protect myself...to protect you?

I thought I handled that part quite well, actually. A little victory for me...but then, the shocker.

SystemMessage: *** ""Nicole"" signed off at Wed Feb 09 16:00:02 2005.

Okay, maybe she really was pissed. This is not good. Not good at all. I have no idea where to go from here or what to say.

Do I think this is the end of us? Quite possibly.
Do I regret not just believing her from the begining? At first I would say no, but then I realize we could be talking and having a good time with each other right so I am inclined to say yes.

The real irony to me is that I felt like I would be justified to break up with her, but because I wouldn't just be a good dumb boyfriend, I am putting myself at risk of being dumped.

So much for a happy Valentine's day."

What's all been happening?

Let's see. I talked to Nicole last night...she IMed cause she's grounded from everything in the world and can only sneak online when no one is home...poor girl.

We threw a lot of crap back and forth. Well, it was mostly me. I was just so upset and angry to be as empathetic as I should have been...and I regret that. But it's too late. She gave me this big long gothic description of her 'uber-high' and how painful it all was for her. I do feel bad for her now, but at the time I felt like...like she deserved it. Like this was the trade off for doing drugs.

Her: i dont know what happend. the docters found extiscy and meth and barbituits in my system along with the THC. so either that pot was laced or somone slipped me somthing. neither sound likley so i dont understand

Holy mother of God, that is a lot of drugs. That is ALOT of drugs. She is one lucky girl.

I couldn't get over all of this as I was talking to her last night. I feel better about all of it now, but I was being a serious dick yesterday. I could not believe she/Kristine/God had let this happen. Seriously.

PEOPLE. DO NOT DO DRUGS. IT IS A DUMB IDEA. CUT YOURSELF INSTEAD.
For fucks sake, they are about as equally as healthy and productive.

Geremy (Kristine's ex-boyfriend) IMed me just to tell me how much of an asshole I am for not immediately forgiving her for almost killing herself with narcotics. Honestly, i don't get you people sometimes.

Kristine and I were angry at each other all day because I kinda of accidentally blamed her for this. I feel like she's a bad influence on Nicole, but I guess if Nicole has been smoking longer than she is like Kristine says, it's kind of hard backup my argument.

I'm not really angry anymore, we yelled a bit, and I think we both feel better because of it.

Things are sort of back to normal now, I'm talking to Nicole like old times...things might get back to normal after all.

Looks like she's banned from ever seeing anyone ever again, though...I guess our Valentine's Day date is off...why god, why must you do this to us?"

It's amazing how a little tragedy can turn a terribly dry day into a...really, really emotionally unsatisfying day.

My life is a sham, my relationships with other people are jokes, I have no friends. My deepest relationships are with strangers over the internet. Last night I played blockland with some other goons. I felt like we had bonded in the few hours we played together better than I had with anyone else in my entire life. My existance is meaningless. I consume without producing, take without giving back. I am a leech in this world.

Where is all this coming from? I honestly can't say.

It all started this morning. I actually felt like I got a good night's sleep. Probably because I got no sleep the night before. (Colin came over and we watch Freddy Got Fingered, and played some shitty Dreamcast games...I fell asleep so he just decided to crash at my place too. Wanted his Xbox game I'm guessing.) Also, because Nikki had neglected to call me Sunday to say good-bye before she left...but I wasn't really upset by that. I guess after people have sex with you you can't really hold anything against them. Anyway...I was unpleased that the alarm had gone off though...I remember saying 'you've got to be kidding me'...haha.

I barely make it out of the house in time for the bus, and I pull out my cell phone to check the time, and there is a message from Kristine. (Are you surprise she started this? I know I'm not.)

It reads: ""Are you at school yet? We need to talk.""
""I'm waiting for the bus.""
""Okay, I'm almost to school. We need to talk. No joking.""
""Uh, about what?""
""I need to tell you in person. This is serious.""

Sure it is.

""Are we actually going to talk or are you just going to yell at me for something?""
""We will actually talk, just hurry up and get here.""

Fine. I don't particularlly want to hear what she has to say about me being a bad boyfriend or whatever dumb shit she's concocted over the weekend, but I guess I'll humor her. I slowly make my way to school.

She drags me away from everyone.

""Nicole is in the hospital.""

I'm sorry, what? I'm pretty sure you just said the woman I love is in a place where they treat people who have been seriously injured.

""She came over Saturday night and hung out with me and Aubrey and Geremy.""

True. I talked to Nicole via text message that night. On Kristine's phone. Where is this going?

""We were smoking in my van...""

Oh, holy shit, you guys. What the fuck did you do?

""She took some ibuprofen because she had a headache. She took a puff and all of a sudden she tweaked out and went unconscious. We had to call an ambulance.""

Oh, Jesus Christ.

""I saved her life.""

Fuck you, your drugs almost killed her.

""They found traces of Meth...and Barbiturates in her bloodstream. Barbiturates are like Speed.""

Fuck you, I know what Speed is.

""We don't know how they got there.""

Yeah, of course you don't. Drugs just magically find their way into peoples' bodies. Happens all the time.

""She's alright, though. She told me to tell you all this.""

Well at least she had the courtesy to tell me about her near death experience through proxy.

""Don't tell anyone.""

Okay, I won't. (Hello Internet!)

I spent the few minutes left between then in first period in an emotional coma in front of my locker. I finally picked myself up and drug myself away.

""Don't be down about it. You didn't have to be there like I was.""

Fuck you. Just because I wasn't the one who force fed my girlfriend copious amounts of drugs doesn't mean my feelings don't count.

After school she leans close and says, ""I'm supposed to say that you can talk to me about it.""

Oh, like talking about how I hate you? How I hate you for doing this to her? For taking an otherwise innocent girl and almost KILLING HER? Honestly, you be a dumb bitch and do drugs as much as you like, but when you start hurting other people is the time to stop.

Me: ""I think I'll be okay.""

I am not okay. I've never done drugs before. I've never had to deal with drug-related problems. I don't know what it's okay to feel and what I should be doing. I wish Kristine at least had taken responsibility for this and said she was sorry. 'We don't know how it got there'...hah. There are only so many possible explanations.

1) They were fucking doing meth and speed while smoking.

If 1 is the case, I hate them all. I don't want this to be the case because it might actually lead me to want to break up with Nicole.

2) Kristine and Aubrey peer pressured her into taking Meth and Speed.

If 2 is the case, Kristine needs to be curb stomped. This, to me, seems one of the more likely scenarios.

3) Nicole had a headache and went through Kristine/Aubrey/Geremy's things looking for tylenol, saw ibuprofen bottle, didn't realize that afforementioned person KEEPS THEIR SPEED AND/OR METH THERE, TOOK SOME, AND COULDN'T HANDLE IT.

3 seems the most likely to me. If this is the case, I want to try and prohibit her from ever seeing any of those people again. I know, of course, this will never work, she doesn't listen to me, and I am second to her friends. I don't even know if this is an okay thing to want.

4) She went through her own things looking for tylenol and found her /sister's/ Ibuprofen.

If this is the case and her sister is to blame then I am sincerely sorry for everything that is said here. That not with standing, this seems the least likely scenario to me.

In any case, I suspect Kristine knows more than she will tell me.

I'm not sure who I'm more mad at, Kristine or Nicole. I'm mad at Kristine for probably almost killing my Girlfriend, and I'm mad at Nicole for sending afforementioned attempted murderer to tell me about it. I'd really like to think that I deserved hearing about this first-hand. Then again, as I've said before, friends > me.

Is it okay to be mad? Am I supposed to be more supportive? Is this just a bad coincidence, and is no one's fault at all? Should I just keep letting her do her drugs and wait till she kills herself and then go 'what a shame, didn't see this one coming', or should I tell her to stop doing drugs and if she can't, I'm leaving? Is that innapropriate? Am I worth enough to her to make the gamble even possible?

Does it even MATTER? Is this ANY of my buisness? Do I get to have feelings?

So many questions, so few answers. I'll update as more develops. Post comments about your wacky drug related stories so I don't feel like such a shit stain, please!"

"event","I love how the worst day of my life is always followed my the greatest day of my life. Emotional rollercoaster AHOY!

Nikki called last night after she got out of the movie (which she didn't take me too...I'm not sure if she was still punishing me or if it didn't actually cross her mind) and we talked like absolutely nothing had happened. Maybe she got off her little hissy fit or maybe I started to feel a little guilty, I dunno. (Actually, I'm pretty sure KRISTINE was the only one genuinely angry through this whole thing. She just <i>eminates</i> drama and pissiness. I shared with Rane last night my theory that she has some sort of Drama emitting beacon in her vagina. The irony is, she is the only one who has no reason to be pissed off.)

Our conversation was pretty normal. In fact, I'd say it flowed more smoothly that they usually do. I guess recognizing we both messed up might have made us a bit more quick to chat. We were both pretty upset that we weren't with each other at that moment; we kept trying to persuade each other to come over to each other's houses, but she volunteered to sneak over early this morning so we could...make up.

She was late by several hours (despite the fact I explicitly told her to be on time), but it wasn't entirely her fault. Her mom was up when she was about to leave and her mom pretty much knew what we were intending to do. Nicole did manage to get over here by about 8, though.

We didn't waste much time, either. We finished fucking by about 10, as I recall. Definately a personal love making record. It was really great, it finally stopped hurting her enough that we could try a different position too. She seemed to genuinely enjoy herself too...I was fucking exhausted by the time we were done. Who know sex was so much work?

She gave me a handjob a little while afterwards too...I think I was starting to nod off and she wanted to keep me awake. She succeeded, to say the least...haha.

We relaxed for a while, trying to regain our strength. Then we started watching Anchorman - The Legend of Ron Burgundy at about 11, I walked her home at 11:45 and then stopped at Jack In The Box before I came back.

I think our relationship is saved, all thanks to some make up sex.

"event","I fucking hate my life. It looks like last night was just an omen of things to come.

Today was supposed to be the greatest day of my life. I have no idea where it went wrong.

My girlfriend came to school with her best friend today. I was psyched because I have not seen Nikki in 2 weeks. However, I want to be careful not to step on Kristine's toes. She had brought her to school, it was her day to be happy, and I had to stay out of the way.

And what happens? I get the fucking shit abused out of me.

Lunch rolls around and Nikki is there, chatting with friends. I go up and give her a hug, and that was the last we spoke. After that, it was just one big sophmoric (haha irony we're sophmores el oh el) game of grabass, that I for one, refused to take part in. Nikki just kept getting up and <i>leaving</i> at lunch. I DID NOT GO TO GET LUNCH SO THAT I COULD MAXIMIZE MY TIME WITH HER, but she just kept abandoning me. Leaving, to go say hi to her old friends, leaving to go...whatever miscellaneous random place she wanted to go to and I was uninvited to.

I guess I'm just bitter her friends mean more to her than I ever will.

Kristine kept <i>screaming</i> at me to chase after her, but I don't see the point. If Nikki wants to be distant from me that's her perrogative. I'm not gonna chase after her, begging for attention. I'm not going to play that game. I fucking hate that shit.

The whole day I got ripped on because everyone was like 'WHY AREN'T YOU PAYING ATTENTION TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND YOU ARE A HORRIBLE PERSON ETC' but jesus tap dancing christ, if to be a good person I have to fucking beg for her to look me in the eyes, I would like to have my place reserved in hell.

Okay, maybe Lunch was just sour. It'll get better, right?

Wrong.

Chemistry was appaling. We got our packets so I thought I'd work on it a bit cause I want to stay with the game this time. Kristine & Nicole were talking and Rane went over to hang with them, but I actually wanted to get some work done so that I would have less to do tonight (so I can spend more time with Nikki, but I guess I won't even get to see her at all now), so I start to work with Mackenzie and Katie, like I always do. We're having a bit of fun while we're working too, and we finally get done with the first unit so I decide that since neither Kristine nor Rane NOR Nikki have invited me over yet, I'll just go try to squeeze my way into the group and things'll be okay.

Kristine greets me with a 'so you finally decide to come over, you peice of shit'. It's nice to be loved, let me tell you.

So I stand around them, <i>no where to sit</i>, hoping maybe things'll just work back into the natural groove. Oh, what a naive fool I am. Nikki won't look at me. Kristine is angry at me (I have no idea why, she has no fucking reason to be angry at me, I fucking GIVE UP TALKING TO MY GIRLFRIEND SO THAT SHE WON'T THROW A SHIT FIT ABOUT ME STEALING NIKKI AWAY FROM HER AGAIN AND <i>SHE</i> GETS MAD AT <i>ME</i>) and Rane enjoys seeing me in pain so he won't defend or even help me.

About halfway through the class, Kristine started stabbing me with a pen. Repeatedly. Ink soaked into blood, I still tried to be in the conversation as best I could. I think I caught Nikki's glance at one point. We locked eyes for only a moment, but I got this look from her:

I see you are in pain. I can help you; I can stop it, but I will not. I want this. This is punishment.

Class is over, everyone leaves. I try to get in line behind Nikki hoping maybe she'll say something to me...ANYTHING. But no such luck. They scramble away from the classroom with quick feet.

After school Rane tells me that I am fucking up. No fucking shit. 

Apparently everyone's pissed because I was 'flirting with my ex-girlfriend'. I hate my life. I work with Mackenzie EVERY DAY IN CHEMISTRY. EVERY FUCKING DAY. But no, today is special. Today I am being watched. Today I am  being graded. 

Today I am being judged.

You know what? I'm even willing to accept that there might be a grain of truth to that. That maybe, subconsciously, I WAS flirting with Mackenzie. But you know what? All Nikki had to do, was come over, say 'Hi' to me, and lead me away. I would follow her where ever she leads me. I just will not be the straggler.

This whole day has been 'Henry fucked up because he is failing to make Nikki feel special'.

What about me? What <i>the fuck</i> about me?

Nikki made absolutely no more effort than I did to interact. This was boyfriend testing day. How well trained I am? Will I bend over backwards to make sure that she is the happiest she can be? Will I fucking throw myself into mud puddles that bar her path so her shoes may remain clean?

Fuck this shit. I don't deserve it."

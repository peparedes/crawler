"event","My day has been rather uneventful, and now that i am home i find myself thinking about this weekend.  Most people probably think about it as valentine's day weekend, but i am sitting here smiling and thinking about it as the beginning of the moving from Jersey process.  This weekend Alissa and i are gonna be uber romantic and load lots of boxes, and maybe a chair or two into my dad's mad crazy sexy volvo station wagon.  Then when i get back i will put the rest of our security deposit down on our apartment and start moving stuff into our storage unit in the basement there.  I cant begin to describe how excited i am about this.  It means that we will be officially starting to move her stuff up here, which means we are getting close to moving in together.  I cant wait because, not only do i get to get away from my nutty parents, but i get to live with Alissa too!!!  Its like two wonderful things all rolled up into one.  Our apartment is gonna be the coolest, and we are going to make it a warm fun place to be with help from all our wonderful friends who have offered their help with this whole moving thing.  Drink... move stuff... drink... move stuff... tons o' fun.  Yeah, so i figure i will beat the dead horse one more time and say that i am way excited to be moving in with Alissa.  Ok, so i think i have talked enough giddy for one night."

"event","It has been a good morning.  I did my expense report, played stratego and dodgeball, and helped a little girl count out 100 beads for her school project.  All i need to do is type up an newsletter for my site and the majority of my work is done for the day.  To top the morning off, i am going to have pancakes and take a nap.  Sometimes i complain about doing a split shift, but today i dont mind too much."

"event","Today was way amusing until i tried to make a posting about it... I just lost ALL my text TWICE!!!!!!!!!!!!! First time because i switched modes to rich text after typing my whole entry, and the second time because i spell checked and didnt understand that i had to cut and past the whole damn thing to make any changes.&nbsp; GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.&nbsp; The first entry was way funny, the second was was shorter, and less funny.&nbsp; This one will be way short with little funny.&nbsp; Unless you are laughing at my stupidity... I know who you are.&nbsp;&nbsp;So i went to a training this morning, went shopping afterwords, and then did some more shopping while on the phone with Alissa.&nbsp; Highlights-&nbsp; Rolling down the road with my windows with my system bumping for the first time in many months, looking at fun electronics to be purchased later, <A href=""http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=1077628262739&amp;skuId=6314712&amp;productCategoryId=pcmcat40200050002&amp;type=product"">Home Theatre</A>, and walking through 3D bed and bath while on the phone asking questions like ""is this a good color for a bath mat?""&nbsp; and ""wouldnt it be cool to have an outdoor bar set on our deck?""&nbsp; I didnt buy anything there because i left my 20% off coupon at home.&nbsp; I think i am gonna go back there to purchase a bath mat that is both plush, and thoroughly absorbent while making it clear to the rest of the bathroom that is it BIG PIMPIN!!!&nbsp; Peace in your mom's crease y'all..."

"event","SOOOOOOooooo... This is livejournal huh.  I figure since this is my first posting and i got this account mainly so that i can post comments on other people's journals, i should probably keep this posting fairly short and full of all sorts of terrible uses of the english language.  MMmmmm run-on sentences, my bread and butter.  The school i work at had a delayed opening today, so i had to work later in the morning than usual.  The end result of this is that i didnt get my midday nap in, so i will probably be rather cranky today.  I pity the fool that comes up to me today whining about legoes..."

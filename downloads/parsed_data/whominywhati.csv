"event","I've logged on, locked in, and bolted the door. And now, I have no idea what to say. I will start with this, a poem:
 
The greater cats with golden eyes 
Stare out between the bars. 
Deserts are there, and different skies, 
And night with different stars. 
(from The King's Daughter, 1930) Vita Sackville-West

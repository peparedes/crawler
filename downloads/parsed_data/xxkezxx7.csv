I don't think i could really summarize this summer in one entry, so i'm not going to try. But at this moment i don't think i could be more stressed out and scared. Senior year...yeahhh...its so weird that high school is almost over. I'm looking forward to being a senior..after college auditions and ap/ib exams are over. Right now i don't even know specifically what i'm stressed about. Its like this overwhelming anxiety that i have had since band camp (well before band camp..and of course i ended up actually having something to worry about at band camp..umm yeahh). But yeah college stuff is stressful too. I want to get out of northport, but i don't want to end up some place where i'm not happy. And right now we're expected to make decisions that will effect the rest of our lives. I think most of all i'm worried about auditions..i feel like i'm so behind that i shouldn't even bother. But practicing relieves my stress a little. 

I was going through my beskin stuff from last year (yes i saved it all) and i found the hand out that he gave us that tells us what we need to do in order for him to recommend us. I felt lost just reading it!!! I have no idea what i am going to do!!!! He probably won't recommend me because i won't have anything ready early enough to be one of his 30 people he recommends. oook i'm totally gonna stop before i go insane trying to think about a million things at one time."

"event","Hey everyone! Ahh finished my two hardest finals today...english and math!!! Tomorrow I just have american and chem, which to be honest I couldn't care less about. I kind of did stuff for the AP exam, which was like a month ago, so hopefully regents questions should be easier compared to them. And chem I stopped trying like months ago, so I don't expect to do well and I know even if I tried to cram tonight, it wouldn't do much good. W/e I'm done with the Beskin final...although no English class will ever be as good as his. And math wasn't as bad as I thought considering I bombed the practice test. Actually I was freaking out because I forgot my calculator and math text book so I made my driver's ed car drive to my house so I could get them. Woo never thought I'd would be glad I had driver's ed in the morning. 
Then we had this lead orientation thing tonight. It was quite intesting, but it sounds like fun. Actually its looking like senior year is going to be a million times better than junior year. I've been in such a good mood this week because the year of hell is almost over and next year is gonna be so much better. Ok junior year wasn't ALL bad, but many more bad points stand out in my mind over the good ones. But whatever its over offically after the chem regents which is...wait I don't give a shit haha thats right...well its over soon!!!"

Annddd Heather recently brought it to my attention that now that i am drum major i can ask the band....JEALOUS?!!!! hahaha


Hmm trying to think what else happened before today...Ahh yes composer's concert. That went very well!! It was stressful as usual, but it was worth it in the end, cuz my piece ended up sounding amazing. And now Doyle wants me to submit it to this like compositional nyssma or something, which is good news. Today i also realized how fucked i am for most of my finals. I knew doing nothing all year would catch up to me eventually. Too bad i don't care...its sad i have senioritous and i'm not even a senior. But its ok that this year sucked for the most part b/c next year is gonna be amazing!!!!"

And granted I did skip most of today to use sibelious to print out my score and parts, but again at least I finished!!! And composer's concert means the year is almost over!!! The year of hell is almost over!! Actually it wasn't all bad. Just the work part of it was pretty brutal, but it wasn't unexpected. Whatever, its almost summer!!! 
And its monday night but we don't have tour choir!! What does one do with a free monday night? Homework? I think not. I should be working on ib oral report or something/ taking some steps in the general direction of studying...theres more to do that I probably forgot or blocked out of my mind. But getting my piece done was a very big thing that was stressing me out so I rewarded myself by not doing anything today after I got home from school. Niceee

"event","Wow the last like 2 weeks have been crazy!!! But soo much fun!!! Last weekend was the band/orch baltimore trip. Such good times!!!!!! On the first day we walked around the baltimore harbor, went to this random place for dinner the went to a basketball game. Kind of not musically related but it was still so much fun. Then the next day we went to the university of maryland and the band guy did a workshop with symphonics, which was really good. Then we saw the baltimore symphony which was fun i think? kinda fell asleep...along with everyone else who was there from our school. Then we went to espn zone for like 4 hrs and played games and stuff there...again random but fun. Then we got backt to the hotel, and hung out there, played big booty in a random court yard, then when we got back to our room, we found our sink was leaking and flooded our bathroom so we had to change rooms at like 12:30am. The last day we went to this random high school and played for all the music kids there (about 60 people total) then we stopped for lunch and went home (actually we went straight to tour choir when we got back to the school). 

So this past week was like trying to catch up on work and sleep. Nothing exciting really. Then yesterday we sang at alice tully hall with tour choir!!! Wow such good times. It was an awesome hall and we got a standing ovation. It was really exciting just being like back stage. Even tho we had to sing richard rogers with people who can't sing in tune for the finale, it was totally worth it. Even after it was over i was still like going crazy. 

...and thursday is CARNEGIE HALL!!!!!! Ahh all these places northport music has conquered in only 2 weeks."

"event","So, this past weekend/week i flew to chicago with my mom and we stayed with my aunt and my cousin, then we rented a car and drove to wisconsin!!! Yes the scenery for 4 hours was farms and cows, but it was still awesome haha. So we drove to lawrence university, and stayed in this beautiful old victorian guest house for 2 days. Basically i love it there and i would be extremely upset if i don't get in. The campus is beautiful and they have a brand new conservatory and art building...what more could i ask for?!!? But my mom and her 2 sisters went there and old college friend teachers theory in the conervatory, which is what i want to do when/if i get there, so i have a pretty good chance. I also met with the clarinet teacher to like ask him what he would like to hear when i audition in january (scary thought) and he was very nice and helpful. So i definetly felt welcome and stuff there and i didn't want to come home tuesday, but kinda couldn't miss more than 2 days of school. Its good to know like where i want to go and what i want to do, its one less thing i have to worry about this year. 

Yeah and this weekend is the baltimore trip, so looks like i won't be catching up on work from this week this weekend. I actually don't really have any time to do anything anymore. My chem teacher told me i had to make up a lab and i was like wow i seirously don't have any time before the end of the quarter (which is tomorrow)..but its ok i already know im failing chem cuz i never go to class. Whatever, i have to worry about passing my ap exams first. Arggggg april= death!!!!!"

"event","Hmmm lets see...didn't do too many exciting things this weekend. It wasn't long enough tho, or relaxing enough. I organized the month of april on my calendar and realized that i will not be home for the next 2 weekends in a row, or any time during the week for that matter. This weekend im going to chicago to see my aunt and then visiting my top choice school in wisconsin. Yes its in the middle of no where but it has an awesome conservatory and like everything else. But yeah my mom still has friends there since she went there so im sitting in on her friend's theory class and jazz composition class. Then the weekend after that we're going to baltimore with symphonics and orchestra. Hmm don't really know what to expect with this one. It seems like the trip freshman year was a really long time ago. Its definetly gonna be different from the boston trip. Then i have ap american review sessions and rehersals all during the week and a million other things, then its alice tully hall, followed soon after by carnegie hall. Its all very exciting im just afraid im gonna be too exhausted to enjoy it. 

According to my mom im becoming too cynical because i always go on about the people i hate. I mean its mostly like teachers like my drivers-ed teachers, my ap american teacher, my private clarinet teacher, people like that. But when you are forced to listen to these people everyday, it really gets to you and forces you to become pissed off at everyone. Like my drivers-ed teacher is the stupidest man alive and i feel like im watching a sitcom just being in his class. He looks like hes in his 30s but he acts like hes 14 or something. Don't even get me started on my private teacher...but for example (one of many) harangued me for like 20 minutes about how i should never practice with a metronome and its pointless blah blah blah. And the only thing i got out of his speech is that i should disregard anything he says because he is a cynical old man. And no comment about ms dolle because if you have her or ever have, you know about the horrors.

On a lighter note, my grandparents just informed my family that after i graduate they're taking us on a mediterranean cruise!!!!!!!!!!! Its probably gonna go to like the greek islands, italy, turkey and other places like that. Its seriously like my dream vacation im amazingly excited!!!! Yayy for good news!!!!!!

And im blaming my horribly bad cynical mood on post-pit depression, happens every year. It like going crazy for the show and then suddenly its over. But it was ooooooooh so much funnn. MAMEEEEEE"

"event","Craziness!!!!! This past week we had MAME dress rehersals after school and even like during school for ridiclous amounts of time. Of course it was soo much fun and was totally worth it. But thursday was the opening night of the show. It didn't go horribly but it could have gone better. The pit was kinda off in the first half. Then friday i came home feeling sick but went to Gee's house for the pit dinner (woo good times) then to the show. Friday was definetly the best night, we were really on and we had alot of fun in the pit. Then a bunch of pit people went to Angie's house for a while. 

Saturday i woke up feeling worse and went to the doctor. They told me i had all the symptoms of strep but i don't actually have it...? So even tho i felt like totally shit i went to the last night of the show. After my medicine finally kicked in after intermission i felt ok. Then like 7 of us squished into Chris' car and went to the cast party. It was fun kinda, but since we're not in the 'cast' we wern;t as welcome. Even tho there wouldn't be a show without us, duh. Then Lianna, Chris, Sarah and me went to my house at like 2am, and we all fell asleep i think then they left at like 5:30am. Didn't really sleep much this weekend, but it was good times anwaysss. 

Yeah haven't done hw in like 2 weeks honestly and i have an american test tomorrow that i didn't do shit for. But its ok cuz im still sick an im not going to school tomorrow. Even tho im gonna have to do hw all day to make up all the shit i missed/didn't do.

"event","Hmm lets see...wednesday was the opera trip, it was good fun except we had to leave during the second intermission to go back to the school and have rehersal. But byt the time we got to the school and were ready to go, we only had like an hour and a half left of rehersal.

Thursday was school then rehersal again from 3-8. Shirley kept accusing me of having too much sugar or something but i was really only having a bad day. Being in school for 13hrs kinda does that to u.

Friday we had no school, i actually think i slept like 12hrs cuz i was so exhausted from the week. Had a lesson, took some pictures for art, and went out to dinner with lianna. 

Wow saturday was very random. We met my mom's best friend from college in the city cuz she was in town for her daughter's band trip. We met them at the metropolitian museum of art and alked around there. I got yelled at multiple times for taking pictures of like everything i saw. Then after that the wisconsin people let us get on their bus and tour the city with them. It was funny cuz everyone thought it was amazing that we live here. Then later me and my mom went to the met to see Samson et Dalila. It was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was seriously the greatest opera ever!!! Saint-Saens is a fricken genious!!!! But again we had to leave early to catch a train. But of course we waited until after Bacchanale because that is the best song ever. And it does actually mean orgy in French, which i didn't understand until i saw the opera and there was an orgy going on on stage. So thats twice in one week i left early from an opera at the met??

Side note....tickets to see an amazingly awesome opera at the met costs less than it does to see symphonics play a Carnegie Hall. Yeah thought i'd point that out....kinda scary.

Then today we had a dress rehersal from 12-5 and i haven't started my hw yet. Actually it doesn't really matter cuz we're rehersing 2nd-6th periods tomorrow, then after school from 3-8, then we have tour choir from 8-10. Should be fun if i live thru it. *sarcasm*"

Wow thanks to lea i just got my sweet 16 pictures on my picture website thingy. http://community.webshots.com/user/xxkezxx8288 .....go to it and sign my guest book!!! even tho my sweet 16 was like at the end of july, im just getting my pictures up now. its so funny cuz i didn't take any of them...i put disposible cameras on each table and let everyone just take the pictures. wow getting that film developed and looking at all those pictures was the funniest thing ever. there were some pretty crazy ones that i couldn't even like tell what it was. i have more of me and my family and stuff i still have to scan if i ever have time. wooo that was good times"

Well since its tuesday i had a private lesson. ARGG i hate my teacher!!!! he def knows what hes talking about with the clarinet stuff, but i hate the way he teaches and just him in general. he is ridiculously stuck in the past (cuz hes like 70 or something) and he thinks all there is to life is playing the clarinet. despite the number of times i told him i'm not going to college for clarinet performance, he still thinks i have time to spend like 15 minutes on one measure of an exersise. nope sorry i have a life. and it really pisses me off cuz i know i can't get a new teacher this close to all-state so even if i wanted to change teachers, i would have to wait until after all-state. well thats me ranting about my teacher. ok im done bye"

And the funny part is none of my teachers believed me when i said i couldn't get online to do hw or whatever. But i actually wasn't pulling that out of my ass. Go figure.
Yeah so since last time i've written there were many good times and christmas and the whole break and such. But it was quite fun and relaxing somehow.
And actually i got season i of the OC on dvd, but my mom ordered it from amazon.com and it didnt arrive until today so instead of doing ap american i watched 4 hours of the OC!!!!!!!! And damn proud!!! Actually i haven't done much work this whole week. Partly because of the stupid course presentation day thing which i guess got me out of going to class all day, but i still worked on art all day. 
I'm actually extremely stressed about choosing my schedule for next year. If i go for the non-slacking off schedule, then its gonna be basically the same as this year (which is NOT a good thing) only like a level up. So I'm meeting with my guidance counselor tomorrow to be guided. Exciting i know, but i get out of choir so hey, im not complaining."

Then tuesday and wednesday were regular school days. Then thursday the all-county people came to our school. It was so weird cuz i kept seeing people i knew from CYM!! Some people i saw i didn't even know lived on LI. It was so weird to see people from camp in our school. Then friday i went to like 2 classes cuz we got signed out of the whole day practically to help out with all-county. Of course im still making up work and i probably will b making up work all week but whatever. Then we ushered the concert/watched some of it. Then a couple of us went to a diner, and ran into more CYM people!! It was so ironic. but good times.

I've been sleeping and watching tv all weekend trying to get better so i dont have to miss more school. Oooh yeah and i got my report card..did alot better than i expected which was cool. And one of my students got first chair!!! Yayyy!! Now im just procrastinating the shit load of hw i have from the whole week."

"event","Hmm trying to think what has happened in the last week or so...nothing exciting ever happens really so yeah
actually today was fun cuz we did this photo shoot in ap art with a huge piece of plexi-glass rested on 2 tables in the a-wing hallway. Minardi put all kinds of things on it like raw eggs and vases and transparent colored paper and rope and other weird things. It was so much fun and it was even more fun to watch people walking by trying to figure out what we were doing standing on a giant piece of clear plexi-glass. hopefully something portfolio-worthy will come out of this all. 
today was also fun cuz i didnt really do anything in any of my classes...at least i wasn't paying attention. i went to choir lessons instead of gym, then helped people with the symphonics music. then i went to chem and got a 103 on my test. go figure i have never done hw for chem. but i do have a quarterly on firday so i might actually have to crack the text book. then me and laura and sam went to math extra help instead of band cuz shirley was with all the all-county people. 
now im extremely tired cuz i was up late finishing that stupid would lit paper for beskin...and some people on an IB committee in france or something. but friday and next week we're watching like an actual good movie during class so it was worth it to get it done. 
and tomorrow is going to be AMAZING!!!! 

Yayy laura i updated!!!!!haha"

But this year is just ridiculous. 9th period we sucked beyond belief...and its the day before hofstra. It is beyond me as to y people would put hundreds of hours into practicing this show but not care at all about how we look at the biggest performance of the year. People just don't pay attention to the people around them..and hello thats the whole point of marching band!!!! And there are like 4 people who are an exception to this. All lianna and I do is yell at people but for some reason people choose not to care at all. Why do these people even bother??!!! And then they expect to look so good at hofstra and still be the best band on LI...helloooo reality check!!!!!! We're not gonna be good unless people actually start caring and work together and shut the hell up when they need to be silent. It amazing really....i watched the show from above on shirley's podium thingy at clinic and then again like 2 weeks ago...i didn't see any difference. Which is just plain sad if u ask me...i mean we practice every fucking day!!!!!!!! You would think that something would click between now and then. We even had a fucking saturday rehersal at like 9am!!!!! And it sucks cuz right now theres nothing we can do about anything really. But u bitches just wait until next year!!!!"

"event","Well this that was an interesting 3 day weekend. 
It stared with friday being extremely random. We had an ap american field trip during period 3-7. We went to npt library to listen to this old guy lecture us about nothing specific. Then they dropped us off in npt village to do whatever for an hour. So we got lunch an stuff the went back for 8th period. 8th was basically a free period (well it was kinda a pizza party for the choir but we just sorta wondered around the school). Then because of that drill thingy i ended up missing my bus and waiting at the school for like 2hrs. Then we had group later so all was good.

Hmm saturday i did absolutely nothing except like drive. I drove like everywhere actually which was fun. Then lianna and chris came over and we played tony hawk until 1:30am when they left. 

Sunday i had psat review which was a complete waste of time. They spent more time arguing about what lesson we should be reviewing than actually learning. Not like that math teacher has any idea what shes doing. I asked her a question about a problem, and she goes 'hmm theres some formula that goes along with this problem but i don't know what it is' yeahhh

Now im just procrastinating cuz i have an ap american take home quiz and an essay both of which require way too much energy which i really dont have right now."

I totally needed to do that. I had way too much going on to still be doing something like that. I wasn't like getting anything out of it anymore anyways. People acted like sad but i  sincerely doubt anyone is too upset. Cheerleaders aren't my type of people what can I say. I feel unbelievibly relieved. Its so nice knowing I can actually go home on the bus tomorrow after school. My coach wasn't mad either, she thought I was making the mature decision. I mean i think I'm the only one on my squad who takes AP classes anyways. So no one really understood. Whatever. It was fun last year, I guess. 

Yeahh now I have to go write a FRQ essay for AP american. Don't worry, I won't have too much fun.

P.S. the only reason I write in this thing during the school year is for means of procrastination of hw. in case it wasn't obvious enough haha."

I feel like all my friends are different or most of them i don't see during the day. Im lost in all my classes except ap  art and ap music (if im lucky). This year is just really not going well. I miss last year and feeling comfortable in school and actually having good days. This year I feel like all I do is sit at this stupid desk and do hw. I never actually get to talk to alot of my friends. And when I actually do get to talk to them, all there is to talk about is how sucky school is. I mean the choir trip to Saratoga was alot of fun because I was with alot of my friends but we wern't in school. I dunno this year i feel very detatched and alone. I mean i come home from school everyday in a bad mood. It doesn't help that i have cheerleading practice almost everyday and i despise it. Its alot different from last year too. Not in a good way. I can't deal with it anymore, I'm seriously considering quitting. It would make my life alot easier and I wouldn't exactly be upset about it. I mean I still have to talk to some people about it before I completely quit but I'm really leaning twards it. This year is just way too much for me. I want to get out of here and go to college. I just want to feel comfortable and have fun again. But in reality I know i still got 2 more years of this shit.
Yeahh that was me venting/procrastinating ap american paper."

""Everyone's going to the party,
won't you come if I come
with a friend for your friend?
I'd be so pleased to see you
out of the classroom wearing the smile that I'll bring you.
I was hoping to learn a few things like..
Do you do you like dishing the dirt
on the whole class or
talking the big smack or
playing the fool or
wearing all of the latest fashions
or bucking the new trends
wearing your old threads or
if you like coffee in the evening
These are a few things that I'd like to know

""I've been scheduled to work but I'll call in
and my friend isn't busy
he'd be happy to join me
and maybe my friend
and your friend
will hit it off or maybe we will?""

I'm dying to know
do you do you like dreaming of things
so impossible or only the practical
or ever the wild or waiting through all your bad bad days
just to end them with
someone you care about
and do you like making out
and long drives and brown eyes
and guys that just
don't quite fit in
yeah do you like them
So yes, I'll see you there.

The first day when Lea and I got there, me made friends with everyone in our half of the hallway: Sara, Tiffany, Leigh, Alli, Laura, and Jess. We ate meals together and laughed at everything there was. ahh i miss u guys soo much!! <3. And of course u met people in like ur classes and stuff and it was cool cuz u saw them everyday constantly. The only bad thing about CYM was the rules. The counselors there were so fricken anal!!! U couldn't go anywhere without a counselor. The day consisted of traveling in between 3 buildings along with everyone else in the camp. U went from the dorms to the dining hall to crane for your classes then back to the dining hall for lunch, back to crane then back to the dorms. By the end, everyone was kinda going crazy. It was insane, they knew where u were at all times.

Its crazy how much i got out of it tho. It sorta gave u a taste of what going to music school is like. In the morning i had clarinet master class with the professor of clarinet who is now retired. He knew everything there possibly is to know about the clarinet. Then i had symphonic band for an hour and a half. Hah no comment. Then i had clarinet ensemble for another hour which was about 28 clarinet players. Then lunch (it was weird having time for lunch) After lunch we had choir. Ahh i loved choir!! It was all-camp choir so there were about 350 kids in it. Then i had band again for another hour. (again, no comment) Then i had theroy with a theroy/harp professor at crane. 

It was soo much fun but we got like no sleep and im still tired. so im going to go sleep again. i miss all my CYM people!!!!!!!"

Thursday- last day of classes, but when classes end, hell begins. so really it wasnt much of a relief that school is over, cuz its not. well the day was pretty normal, teachers mentally preping us for the regents exams. then i came home and slept for a while...didn't bother to study for any finals.

Friday- final day. i had comp first for an hour and a half. but it was by far the best comp class all year!!! doyle started going over the packet/ making us do sight singing (which i bombed) and somehow him teaching us was funnier than usual. then we watched the Meat Loaf video from like 1988 or something. hahhaha funniest thing ever!!!! doyle in a huge trench coat, spandex pants and the same hair!!! then he told us stories of his travles with Meat Loaf for a while. all of us were amazed. then i had my math final which was sooo stressful and mind draining. then i had my global final- 100 multiple choice...talk about mind draining. then lianna and john came over my house. we were so tired we just sat on my couch for like 3 hours (well at least they did haha). then i went to Leah's sweet 16!! it was awesome!! lots of good times.

This morning i had a clarinet recital which was weird. i bombed all my runs, but my musicality and intonation was amazing. i kinda expected that since i havent practiced in weeks. right now im trying to study for bio, but im so preoccupied and ready for summer that i can't concentrate. so i should go do that now....have a nice day :)"

I mean, fuck, I know that I'm <i>not</i>, but taking it all into consideration...

Gay deathrocker Asian kid in a North Florida high school.

I face an irritating number of stereotypes. I do not have a small penis. I do not cut myself. I do not worship Satan. I'm not a fucking atheist. I'm not a fucking wiccan. I do not listen to or even generally like heavy metal music. I don't paint. I have a shitty sense of fashion. I can't cook a bowl of spaghetti, let alone pais de whatever the fuck you want me to make. I have no idea what color your hair should be.

I don't know why people think that I WANT to fill the ""gay best friend"" niche, because it's just more that's expected of me when all I want to do is enjoy myself, which 99% of the time does not involve girls hanging off of me. It doesn't bother me if it happens a few times, and the affection is nice if I'm close enough with the girl, but <b>it grates on the nerves.</b>



I was thinking about that line from <i>Moulin Rouge!</i> today.

<i>""The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.""</i>

It's probably from somewhere else, but I don't really care. Where it came from is irrelevant. I know that before I thought that it was difficult for me to be loved. I thought of myself some as unlovable, and still do to a certain extent. At this point, though, the reverse holds true far more. I've found myself becoming more cynical and shallow.

Another good teen movie? Jaded pretty boy meets some kid who's crazy about him? Zany antics insue?

Honestly, I think that my life should never be made into a book or a movie or anything like that. It'd be horribly boring and mostly consist of nothing but the incessant brooding and angsting that I do. If I ever get famous, I will definitely see to it that I never write an autobiography.

I'd probably crap out on it halfway anyways.

I wonder if I'll die halfway through my life. What a fitting time to end that would be..."

"event","I've been thinking... what if I was a character in a story told in the first person or third person limited?

How developed would I be? Would I play a huge part, or would I be just a passing person?

It would all depend on who the main character was...
If I were the main character, I would obviously be a very developed character, being able to bare my emotions to an invisible reader without even being aware of doing so.

But what if Lexi were the main character?
Suddenly, I've become the character to fill the niche of the gay best friend. I would be an important character, and the reader would know me quite well, but not as well as Lexi herself or Mike.

And if Mike were the main character?
I become a smaller character. I'm his girlfriend's best friend. My thoughts are made known. Some of my emotions and small parts of personal life are made clear, but little is truly known about me.

Matt?
By then, I become, to the reader, an ex-boyfriend who couldn't let go. A stalker. Someone who nearly killed the story's hero. Someone who may very well nearlly kill him again. It becomes easy to either dislike or pity me, depending on the reader. Much is known about the sort of person I am, and certain aspects of my personal life are known by the reader, but I am portrayed as someone who is mentally and emotionally unwell.

Russell?
I am a major character again, being shown in a far more positive light; as the boyfriend. I am, in the narrator's/main character's eyes, at least, a very lovable person and am seen as a good person. I am extremely developed, if solely from our conversations. My innermost thoughts and the state of my life is well-known.

I've been wondering that for a while. He's talked about how he's been in love with Alex ever since I've met him, and it's caused him a lot of distress.

He sort of avoided the question when I asked him.

Ouch. Haha.

I'll probably end up asking other people the same question. Like Mike.

I kind of wonder... what do I love? Is it a person? Is it a thing? Do I love the piano? Do I love music in general? Do I love myself? Do I love Chris? Do I love art?

I just don't know.

What if I don't love anything?

Is that a bad thing?




Today is special, as it marks the first day I have been horny and introspective at the same time.

Chris and I are going to get tested for HIV together.

Ah, that does a wonderful job of killing my sex drive. It makes me pretty nervous. I'm not really too much more sexually active than most teenagers, even though I guess I sort of give off a manwhorish vibe. I'm still pretty nervous about it all, though.






I think it's sort of funny how a few years ago, at that lock-in at Adventure Landing with my school, my friend Alyssa had brought her sister and her friend Lloyd with her. I remember thinking Lloyd was hot but that was about it, and I didn't really expect to see him again. I spent the whole time with Alyssa when Lloyd walked off with her sister.

Now it's... I think three years later? I found out that Lloyd is (was?) Chris' best friend. They have (had?) one of those weird best friendships that has a romantic element to it, and they were ""sorta dating"" until Lloyd went off and had a threesome. Now apparently Lloyd's none too happy about my presence in Chris' life. He won't even call me by name; he'll just call me ""him."" They had a big fight. That bothers me, because I <i>know</i> it was partly to do with me, no matter what Chris says.

I feel like situations like this shouldn't happen in a city that's supposedly ""the largest city land-wise.

I hope they work out this whole situation. I'd hate to see Chris lose his best friend...

"event","I was supposed to go have fun with my friends today, but that didn't work out.

But that's okay
because I wrote <s>one</s> <s>two</s> <b>three</b> songs today, giving me a total of five to record.

That's demo-tape worthy, right there.

Or at least worthy of burning onto a CD so when people meet me and go ""oh, you're a singer? SING FOR ME."" I can just give them that without having to perform for them privately. That's always so awkward, especially considering that it's one of the first things people learn about me and suddenly expect me to burst into song for them.

I generally don't burst into song around a person unless I've known them for at least two weeks.

Looking at my lyrics, I notice that I need to use less novelty tricks in my writing (i.e. making the last word of a sentence the first word of a new one, or double-entendres) as well as trying not to use ""fuck"" nearly as often.

Overall sound-wise, there are enough stylistic differences between each song to keep them all from sounding the same, but enough similiarity to give me as an artist an overall ""sound,"" which is good. On the other hand, my voice does not have a particularly unique sound when compared to the major vocal influences of this project (Regina Spektor, Rozz Williams, Tori Amos, Amanda Palmer, Judith Shimer...), and while the concept of a male singer-songwriter writing with a tone and on subject matter that would traditionally be considered ""female"" may sound novel or even ""good,"" it will require meticule and prudence to actually make it work. Most likely I will have to compensate lyrically and work with multitrack studio recordings, rather than a simple single-track live one. I must also be careful not to let my musical influences come through too strongly. The style I'm working with right now depends on the absolute sincerity and intimacy of the artist, and I <i>will</i> need to keep that in mind.

It's been a pretty good day. Even if only because I actually wrote some songs."

The whole trip was pretty inconvenient... I spent New Year's Day in a car for twelve hours with the parents and brother, and Saturday (at which point I was still in Louisiana) Lexi had planned on bringing me to Eclipse with her.

My evening was spent playing Final Fantasy XII. I think I might actually beat this one. The only Final Fantasy I've ever finished was the re-release of the first one, and I've played about five. It's shameful.

I felt jealousy for the first time today. It was a weird feeling. It was like greed and pride, only less malicious and more insecure. I will need to make a mental note to try and avoid situations that would make me feel jealous, because that is probably the most unpleasant emotion I've felt in a long while, excluding my ""lows"" that seem to be coming and going lately.

I will also need to make a mental note to obtain a top hat and a generous amount of vinyl.

I have decided that being mistaken for a girl is one of the top ten most amusing things that stem from my appearance. Number two is probably scaring small children.

I got this obnoxious karaoke machine/CD player for Christmas. I don't know why my parents decided to get it for me, but I do greatly appreciate it. There is a microphone included, and I have reason to believe that it will do a good job of making my voice sound like shit, but it's still a microphone and I have been in need of one lately. If I could find my old audio recorder I'd have it fucking made. It would certainly make the writing process much easier...

I sure hope that I passed French this semester...

I had a long talk with Mike last night/this morning at 1:00 AM. We mostly talked about spirituality, and he divulged what he remembered from his past life to me. Regardless of whether or not any of it is to be believed, he was suprisingly detailed, using names of people and places, describing his sword, chronicling his life and going into great details about significant events.

Supposedly, America is to fall in three years. Mike may be planning to explore the Atlantic at that point. I want to go with him. I have very little to leave behind here, save for a few special people who I will probably have lost touch with by that point. Either way, I will probably die before I'm thirty.

Andrew.

We're sort of friends,
but he's really pissing me the fuck off right now.

Now, he tells me that he's really horny before our overnight field trip starts. I can sympathize. At Epcot, he's acting like a pretty good guy, but I'm starting to understand that he's also a fuck-and-run kind of guy. My little ""group"" has been Chelsea, Rachel, Andrew and Kirsten, and that was how it generally remained for the entirity of the trip (save for when I went off to make Sarah feel better). Wednesday night at Epcot, he acts really close to Chelsea. It's beyond friend-hugging; it's holding her close, as if they were dating. Thursday, on the bus, he's doing the same thing to Kirsten. On the rides at Magic Kingdom, he has his arm wrapped around Rachel. It was upsetting to everyone. Kirsten, sitting behind him, only needed to write the letters ""M-A-N-W"" in the air before I knew what was bothering her. Chelsea was furious. Rachel was uncomfortable about the whole situation. I <i>did</i> notice that he seemed upset about something. He was crying at one point, and did a really shitty job at trying to hide it. When I asked, he just said that he was ""tired,"" which was obviously bullshit.

I really don't care anymore. As we were loading back onto the bus, Chelsea begins to bitch out Andrew for calling her a lesbian, prostitute, etcetera. Once Andrew got sick of it, he put on his headphones and blared something. As he did that, Chelsea told me the real reason that she was angry. I could have figured as much.

They made an elaborate revenge scheme. Chelsea wanted to take time to really piss him off. Rachel would then comfort him for a while before leaving. From there, it was intended for Kirsten (who really likes Andrew) to do what she wanted; either date him like any relationship, or to seduce him and then leave him. The fact that this was all described to me with a British accent made it all feel very musical-like.

At the time, it didn't seem right, but the entire trip home he was holding Kirsten as though they were dating and was talking shit about everyone else. I was ""sleeping,"" so I heard everything he said.

Once we got off the bus, he approached me as if he had said nothing that I could have (and did) take offense to and just said ""This'll turn out interesting."" I ignored him. He poked me and repeated himself. I acknowledged him after the second repetition. He told me that he really didn't want to date Kirsten. I couldn't do anything but shortly and angrily tell him ""Then you shouldn't have done what you did"" and walk off."

And sure, I may not be the <i>greatest</i> at the piano, but I have an amazing voice, don't I? No, I don't. I can't do anything that any of you couldn't do given a few years. But everyone still fawns over me every time I rape a piano and scream my ass off to music.

I make myself sick, even as I type this.

Don't get me wrong. I don't want any of you to pretend to like me, as I'm sure most of my ""friends"" do. I don't want you to pity me.

God. I can't believe myself. I should've outgrown the whole ""bitching about nothing"" phase. At least I didn't get bombed, right?

Christ. You all make me sick."

I went downtown. I almost got run over by a car from Pizza Hut. The guy didn't even look back to see if I was okay. It made me feel like I was grown-up, in a whimsical sort of way.

I saw some trees for the first time. I love seeing new trees, especially the ones that hang down and sway in the wind and have the branches that you can reach up and just barelyyyyyy touch.

I ran part of the way back. It was so liberating.

I stopped and got ice cream.

Strawberry birthday cake flavor.

Then I went to Starbucks. I was going to go to Uncommon Grounds, but there were a bunch of kids giving me the ""I'm better and more fashionable than you, you stupid fucking teenager"" look and I decided to stay away.

I'm bleeding in a few places. Matt scratched me yesterday when we were fighting. It was the kind of playful fighting that friends do, but it had that  slight sexual tension between ex-boyfriends. It was the kind of fighting that I wished we did a few months ago. It's the kind of fighting I hope I get to do with someone special someday.

I thought Alex was offline yesterday, so I sent him an aim message saying that he should be on aim more often so I can get to know him better because I totally want to date him. It turns out he was invisible at the moment.

Ooooops.

He didn't get freaked out about it, though, so it's just sort of something to laugh about.

I'm asking people what they look for in a guy or a girl. I'm just... sort of curious, I guess.

Dear Lucas Lanthier,
I wish I was as cool and talented as you were.

Vocal concert was last night. I didn't really get to hear much of it.

I'm starting to hate a lot of the freshmen in my department. All the other ones I don't have a problem with, but the vocal department has some really fucking arrogant freshmen this year.

""Jaded"" and ""embittered"" are such dramatic words. I don't want to call myself those by any means, but a lot of the events lately have left me very tired, and I'm noticing that I'm starting to become a lot more hateful, and my mood swings are getting worse.

I suppose last year I never would have imagined hating a lot of the people I do now.

But good god, we are such irritating creatures.

Lexi and Michael broke up. She went and begged for him to take her back. He took her back... this time.

I can't afford for them to seperate, but in case that does happen, I need to stay in contact with Michael. This is my chance to change the way my life has been going and a chance to give myself purpose beyond rotting away in front of a piano that will probably outlive me.

I saw that weird scene again. It was sort of like a flashback. It wasn't as clear this time, but it was the same event. A woman begging me not to kill her baby. This time, she was powder-faced (as opposed to bloody from last time). I couldn't hear her.

There was a man there, too, but I can't seem to remember what he was doing.

Fuck memory.

Fuck time.

Fuck me.

It would be nice if there really was nothing beyond this life.

Although I'd probably find a way to depress myself over that, too.

This afternoon I'm going to go see a movie at the theatre down the street from me. It's some independent horror film made with a <$1000 budget.

Teenagers are such interesting creatures. We all seem to have our own unique brand of angst.

I find it all to be intriguing and completely depressing at the same time.

Caffeine doesn't have a psychological affect on me anymore. It just keeps me awake.

I need to talk to Michael or Matt soon. Hopefully one of them will be able to help me. David may be able to, as well, but I doubt that I'll be seeing him any time soon.

I've invited Rachel, David and Matt to all meet me at the theatre tomorrow, and I'm trying to contact Lexi.

I'm betting myself that not a single one of them will show up.

Rachel will forget, David will ""forget,"" and Matt will make up an excuse because that's just the way he is."

And I'm listening to my new Evanescence CD and it's actually pretty damn good.

I talked to the guys working at Hot Topic. While singing along to The Dresden Dolls. Some lovely man had the CD playing. We walked in at ""Bad Habit"" and I was still in there by the end of ""Truce.""

One guy commented on my Rasputina shirt, while another had a conversation with me about The Dresden Dolls (we both agreed that the first album was better and more eclectic). He plays bass.

I was supposed to meet Alex there, too, but he never showed up. I still had fun. Rachel got mad at him for it, though.

And Lexi went to the wrong mall XD

The only reason I went to the Oktoberfest was for closure of sorts. A sort of reassurance that I survived and have my own identity.

I don't know... It sounds really puerile, but I feel a lot better after going. Ever since what Matt said to me, I've been a little insecure. It's nice to know that it isn't part of me anymore. I was so fucking miserable there, and I felt a lot better about going to DA."

Either way, I can feel a sort of transformation happening.

Lexi and Michael's relationship is going downhill. This is bad, both for me and for Lexi. Michael is probably the best guy that Lexi is going to find. She doesn't realize it. That, and he has something that I need.

There's this guy at school that wants to ""experiment"" with me. He's been flirting with me for the last week. I can't do anything for him. I know I'll probably pass on whatever mental disease it is that I've contracted from that conniving demon.

Apparently I'm popular among the freshmen.

I'm not attracted to any of them.

I suppose I'm starting to go through another one of my self-loathing stages.

I'm turning into some heartless manipulative monster.

I have a purpose in life. That purpose seems to be growing increasingly difficult for me to reach.

Ruthie:
<i>I think what you say about chris and how you fucked my first boyfriend is out of line and really gross. I heard that this is all you talk about, either its sex with him or sex in general. Like when you are in french. It makes everyone awkward around you and they dont really want to hear every day that you are sexually active. 

I am no part of what you and Chris did, yeah he is my first boyfriend, but leave it out whenever you talk about you guys fucking. Its immature and it just brings up stuff that I dont care about anymore. Ive gone through so much shit with people saying how I turned chris gay, all through middle school and still now people make jokes that i turn my boyfriends gay. Which is fine because i know that dating me doesnt make boys gay. 

What happened today was really rude, and you have no right running your mouth to someone like Frew. Im upset, and afterwards i probably said some stuff i didnt mean. Not to your face, but it still makes me mad. 

I just thought Id let you know that you upset me a hell of a lot today.</i>

As you can see, I said some dumb shit today, and I am in that self-loathing stage that always seems to come whenever I <i>really</i> fuck up.

If I were one of those people to always blame everything, I suppose I could probably blame my old school with some cock-and-bull ""Nobody liked me there so I thought that getting attention by being a whore would make me more friends"" rant or blame my exes with some equally stupid ""They used me for sex and said they loved me so I thought that by being overt about my sexuality other people would like me too"" sob-story, but really...

I just can't keep my fucking mouth shut.

I honestly could not give a rat's ass less about what Chris has to say about it, because I know that he did <i>not</i> pity fuck me and he was only slightly tipsy if anything. But I can't believe I was idiotic enough to bring Ruthie into it.

I have some things I need to think about.

Find the root of the problem
and shit.
and do whatever it is that needs to be done to eliminate it.

Goddamn. I feel shitty right now.

I wonder if I'll become some recluse because of this, or whether or not I'll just go to sleep and handle the situation like someone who wasn't so fucking thin-skinned.

I really haven't felt this angsty in a while.

I do need a nap. But I've got homework and shit to do. What a lovely evening this'll be."

1. Katzenjammer Kabarett- ""Gemini Girly Song""
2. Emilie Autumn- ""Gothic Lolita"" (demo)

9. The Dresden Dolls- ""Slide""
10. Jill Tracy- ""Evil Night Together""
11. Switchblade Symphony- ""Witches""
12. AFI- ""Fall Children""

Most likely I'll be taking out Evanescence, The Dresden Dolls and AFI and add some Midnight Syndicate, Moi Dix Mois and Zombina and the Skeletones. And maybe some 45 Grave and Black Ice?

I can't wait to stop caring. That'll be nice.

I'm in one of my ""I don't really like anybody all that much"" moods right now. Part of it's probably because I'm sick, and another part is most likely that one of my friends told me to stop talking to them because I hadn't said ""hi"" in three days.

I would like to be able to look inside people and see how much they'd have to be offered before they would stab me in the back.

There's maybe one or two people who would honestly not trade me for anything. I suppose it's always nice to know that.

On a lighter note, I have begun the process of conquering ""Girl Anachronism."" It won't be long now.

I find it rather funny that since getting that book, I have learned (with little difficulty) ""Girl Anachronism"" and ""Bad Habit"" and not ""The Perfect Fit"" or ""Good Day.""

""The Jeep Song"" is hell to play.

I saw musical numbers from The Clockwork Waltz the other day. The lead didn't have a great voice and she just kinda... stood there. She didn't even wave her arms or anything. It was disappointing.

Which brings me to Kaleidoscope.

Although I did see Valerie. That was a pleasant suprise. The person I brought with me got a LOT more attention than I did, but I didn't mind at all. Hell, I expected it. She made a lot of friends at that school, in spite of how much she hated most of the people there. She's always had a lot of friends. I sort of envy her for that. I can't get people to keep liking me to save my life. That sounds really self-pitying. I don't really think about saying these things. They just kind of slip out of my subconscious. I really appreciate my friends, even if I'm only going to stay friends with maybe three or four of them.

I want to go into someone's subconscious and see what it's like. I wonder how much different they are in the deepest regions of their minds that even they aren't aware of...

Their dreams and ambitions will be consumed. As for the rest... they will probably not live to see their forties. It was a bit upsetting.

Chorus pissed me off, too. Two of the students were put in charge.

""Okay, you have to sing this song louder! Don't worry if your voice is sticking out, because most likely that's what I want to hear!""

""Mr. Clayton's going to be so happy when he gets back!"" 

No, he's fucking not. In that entire period, we learned one page of music and spent the whole class molding the song to what the vision of some egotistical seventeen-year-old rather than doing as we were instructed, which was to work on memory.

By second period, I was exhausted and irritated. But my teacher was nice enough to let me sit in the back of the room and I got to talk with a few of the freshmen. It really cheered me up.

Not that it's possible for me to be gloomy in Mr. Lipp's class, especially after lunch.

Apparently I'm still a virgin. I'm a pretty fucking sexual person, but because I haven't done shit with a vagina most of my straight friends still consider me a virgin.

Virginity is really intangible, though.

Nicole and I were talking about how we'd probably end up fucking each other. It would be on some night where we were both depressed and lonely and talking to each other too much.

I love that girl.

My mom thinks that one of my best friends is on drugs (although she is...) and said she had a ""dumb blonde complex."" I thought that was damn funny.

I was unbelievably bored yesterday, and I composed a ""to do"" list. It's a list of about... twenty or so people that I would do and how many times I would do them. The number was a bit random in most cases, though... The highest was the Alex who doesn't read my journal (52) and the lowest was Matt (2).

Lexi told me I should be a surgeon for Halloween. I might go with that, actually. Or see if I can get a vinyl lab coat.

Of course, she also told me I should be a warlock.

""And you could have those little Mickey Mouse ears and everything!""

Among that, I have also been informed that I am failing my online PE class, I have been told to ""suck it,"" I watched a pianist undress in front of me in a courtyard, I got showtunes stuck in my head, I wrote, I desired alcohol, I fucked up a test, I asked someone if the devil would marry me, I went into ""creepy Jordan"" mode, and wanted sex more than usual.

It's been an odd week.

We read this story about that eruption in Columbia back in 1985 in English class today.

It was a riveting situation. The lahars drowned thousands of people in the nearby village, and one girl was completely submerged in the mud except for her face. She couldn't get out because her dead family had their arms clamped around her legs.

The fictitious story story itself was boring ""I had a fucked up childhood, pity me please"" drivel. It <i>could</i> have been good, with the prostitute mother, abusive father and retarded sister who died mysteriously, but it never went anywhere because the author became so infatuated with her own character and had to juggle his development, the story idea of the girl drowning in mud, the main character's past and an internal conflict in the span of ten pages.

But the whole idea was morbidly poetic. I'd go into why, but nobody really wants to hear that.

I wonder how many songs have been written about that story?"

[22:07] raggedmeterman: do you know how i would describe you to someone who doesn't know you?
[22:08] quiescence13: No...
[22:08] quiescence13: How is that?
[22:09] raggedmeterman: i just want to hear what you think of yourself
[22:09] quiescence13: So...
[22:09] quiescence13: How would I describe myself to someone who doesn't know me?
[22:10] quiescence13: Um....
[22:11] quiescence13: Well... I'm shy at first. And then when I warm up, I can be a bit sarcastic.
[22:11] quiescence13: If I think someone is cute, then I will tell them unless I don't know them well enough...
[22:11] quiescence13: And...
[22:11] quiescence13: um...
[22:11] quiescence13: I'm kind of dim.
[22:11] quiescence13: And...
[22:12] quiescence13: I like music. And I'm not depressed. And I'm a nymphomaniac. And I have bad mood swings. But I try to be happy as often as I can.
[22:12] quiescence13: That's all I can think of right now :\
[22:13] raggedmeterman: hmm
[22:14] raggedmeterman: i would say you were a boy who was aloof in the cutest of ways, and you understand a lot. you're really mature and can give good advice. and you jerk off too much.

It's pretty ironic, though.

After the whole thing with Chris, I had adopted a ""fuck dating"" attitude. And then Matt shows up and does the romance shit. Only he's sincere about it. I think. I don't even know anymore. And now I'm caught up in it all again.


I'm really not that high-maintainance. At least... I like to think that I am. There's only a few people who I actually bring my problems to, and they're people who I really trust. Heh. Maybe I'm trying to convince myself that I'm not as whiny as I must come off as. Or maybe I'm trying to apologize for my incessant angsty moaning.

I bitch way too much about my love life. I need a social life. Or a hobby. Or at least a boyfriend who can keep me satisfied.

Then I could write about interesting things. Like... I could post photos. Or I could write about how I went to the studio and wrote this fantastic piece for string-fucking-ensemble.

I guess I should write about going to San Marco.

I was supposed to meet Rachel, Alex, Sarah, her boyfriend, Matt, Michael, Lexi, Jasmine and Veronica at San Marco today.

I'm not so naive as to actually expect all of them to show up, but Veronica was the only one who did.

Although I admit that it was worth it to have that conversation with Michael on my cell phone. He actually gave me his number, and I've talked to him once or twice. On Wednesday I talked to him online. He told me that he wasn't doing anything Saturday and that he'd ask Lexi if she wanted to meet me. The conversation from this afternoon went as such:

Me: Hey.
Michael: Hey...
Me: Are you and Lexi still coming today?
Michael: ...who is this?
Me: This is Jordan...
Michael: Oh, okay. Actually, I have to go into work in a little bit and Lexi has work at about five or six.
Me: Okay. I'll talk to later.
Michael: Later, man.

I don't know why, but I thought it was all really funny.

Alyssa, Veronica and I all had fun today, though. It's the kind of thing that pop-punk bands write songs about.

We went to the park, Starbucks, Reve, Smoothie King, Marble Slab and Mudville all in one day.

We talked about everything.

I fucking hated Assumption. I want that place to burn. But... out of the sixty assholes in my graduating class, I met some really amazing people.

I should probably just dump him and find someone else. But every time I set my eye on someone, it either blows up in my face or is patently an act of desperation.

It would be just my luck that when I'm finally through with dating for a while, he swoops in with his grandiose empty promises.

And now I'm hoping that things will turn out better. I really should be smarter than that. Gravity is a force. Not a person. People can be stopped in a multitude of ways. But forces are always in control. Always.

To quote Amanda Palmer:

That was about back pain.

I don't care.

Cabaret cast was posted today.

All of the musical theatre sophomores got parts as Kit-Kat Girls or Customers.

Of course, a certain vocal major sophomore got one of the major roles.

I don't know why he pisses me off so much.

He probably just frustrates me.

Good at everything.

Better-than-everybody-else at everything.

Ha fucking ha.

God.

If he wasn't an ass to me earlier this year, I'd probably just be amused and laugh it off.

I hate myself for doing that.

Laughing things off.

It's not even all that convincing.

I don't know why I do it, either.

It's not that I'm trying to hide anything.

And telling people about some situation in my laugh and ending it with ""I actually think it's pretty funny"" probably makes them think that I <i>am</i> hiding my ""true feelings.""

Hopefully Alex and Rachel will show up this weekend. That'd be fun.

Most likely Matt will be interrogating some guy or chasing after Michael.

Pretty Balanced's CD came in the mail yesterday. Their song ""Floating"" reminds me of that last romantic talk we had. I meant what I said there. I really did.

You make me sad sometimes, but that's okay. That's okay if it makes you happy. You deserve to be happy at this point.

I should stop thinking that. For my own sake, I should probably just jump on the bandwagon and say that you're a horrible person.

I just noticed that.

I wonder why? Winter seems so romantic to me...

It's such a beautiful season. Down here it's really more like autumn... but I see so many more moving scenes from winter than, say, summer.

Summer has tension. It overloads on fun, passion, and is overly-free.

Winter has that sort of loving sadness. At least... it does to me.

Veronica took an amazing picture of me today.

That sounds horribly conceited. But it could be any person. The photo itself was really nice.

Really, though, it's just a silouhette on top of a slide.

It's one of those metal slides. One of the few left.

In a way, those slides are like Winter. Cold, sad, and resigned, but still beautiful in its own way.

I really wish that more of those slides were around.

I burned Alex a CD today, since he mentioned wanting mix CDs for his car rides. I don't know him too well, but it was one of those impulse things. Hopefully he'll like it.

I don't know what the fuck my problem is, but I've been getting nervous doing solos ever since I started going to DA. It was awful.

Not the audition itself. The actual song went fine. The shaking was what was really getting to me.

It's always the goddamn shaking. The being unsure of yourself. Maybe it's the pressure of being an art school, but I know that's not it... I can't even sing in front of my vocal tech class, for god's sake.

Oh, well. I don't expect to get a part (there's like... three singing parts for men in Cabaret.), but I still enjoyed the experience. I need to get used to singing in front of my peers again, as well.

Tiffany, you are my new hero for ""And All That Jazz"" and the fact that you made angels cry tears of joy :D

Matt is pissing me off. I know that it's not a good sign when it's a love-hate sort of thing in a relationship. But... committment is not something to change your mind about. I understand that it was really naive of me to actually believe him when he said that he loved me and that we could be together forever, but damnit... He's being bitchy because I'm too <i>nice.</i> What the fuck?

I've noticed that I always seem to end up asking myself why I haven't asked out That One Person yet. Not even just when my relationships are going to hell. I figure it would actually work between us. I have for about two years, now. Probably because of the standard romantic-drama reason: he doesn't seem to care much for me and I'm too scared to actually tell him how I feel. I almost did, once, but I fucked it up. I guess it'll come out eventually. The first time, it was between him and someone else, and I made the wrong choice and I got turned down. I don't really regret that whole situation, though, because I got turned down in what was probably the most amusing way ever.

""He says he doesn't like goths.""

I'm not really upset about the latter issue. I actually think it's extremely funny. My life is like a goddamn after-school TV show.

At least in that aspect.

Life is starting to resemble fiction more and more, evidently. It's kind of amusing. But also a little strange."

That boy... he always impresses me.

He's been through so much more than he lets on. Even more than I knew. I guess I should've been pissed at him. But... our conversation tonight really sort of rekindled something between us.

I'd forgive him for leaving me now. I know why he'd do something like that. There's a sort of quiet resignation about the relationship. It'll end shortly. I know it will. But I want to make it good for him. I know how hurt he'll be after this is all over. Maybe he'll come back to me. I would really like that.

I can't forget about what he's done, though. He used me. He lied to me. He hurt me. He did a lot more than anyone else has done to me.

But at the same time, I can't help but sympathize. Being blessed with a calculating mind, a lack of remorse, and a talent for manipulation and being cursed with being in love with someone who will never be more than ""just friends"" simply because of what society's told him... I don't like the fact that he used people like that. I don't like the fact that he used me, that he used the man that he loves, or that man's girlfriend as pawns to get what he wanted. But... he's not a bad person. There's no such things as bad people.

What he needs most is someone to be there for him. Someone who he can trust. I really want to be that person. Maybe I'm not, but... I get the feeling that he really opened up to me more than he has anybody else. Maybe we won't spend our lives together. That's fine. But I know that there was something special between us that didn't exist between any one of his other lovers. I <i>know</i> that.

I don't even see the point in wasting the effort. He's the worst one. He actually made me <i>believe</i> him. I actually thought I could trust him.

Why all of this?

Because I didn't fucking fit his ""criteria"" for a boyfriend. Two months into the relationship, he's been telling me that he loved me and he's been promising never to leave me and he gave me hope for the future. He told me that there was more to the universe than just this place. And now he's deciding that he doesn't like me after all. Who the fuck does that?

Always. They always suddenly decide they love me and they always change their mind just as quickly. People always lie.

He used to be anorexic. Until he met me he thought he was fucking hideous. He was told that there was nobody else out there for him, and he believed the person who told him that. He was cut with a motherfucking screwdriver. I saw the scar. He cried when I showed him that there was someone for him. He cried because he had someone prove his last boyfriend wrong.

And now he's changed. Now he wants to be abused.

I hate him. I hate him for this. I hate him for taking away more than just himself. I hate him for taking away the hope he gave me and I hate him for proving that no, there are no exceptions and I hate him for showing me just how right I was.

""We'll still be friends.""

What a load of bullshit.

""The only way I'd ever leave you is if you cheated on me.""

""I hate spiders... But I'd let myself be covered in them if it meant I'd get to see you for one more second... if it meant I could hear you say my name one more time.""

""Don't leave me. Everyone leaves me.""

""I love you so much.""

""What did I do to deserve someone as amazing as you?""

All bullshit.

The ground might as well start melting away now, too. I suppose if reality was completely fake too I wouldn't be that shocked."

Not for any emotional reason.

It's just fucking <b>annoying.</b>

They can't even discuss their problems like adults. They yell at each other, mock each other, and their voices rise in pitch when they're angry.

It pisses me off, because all my father ever does is work at the office and bitch at the house. My mother just bitches all day. They are never happy. I swear to god, it's so irritating to watch them create their own little soap opera.

Mother put a tracking device in my father's car. <b>A goddamn tracking device.</b> She paid $600 dollars for the little fucker.</s>

Human nature never fails to interest me.

I find myself criticized by a certain person, and the moment things become too difficult, she turns to me for support.

Not direct support. She came in, crying. She wanted me to give her a hug. I did. I doubt she realized how devoid of emotion it was. She said ""I'm sorry I don't hug you enough."" Then she told me she was going out for a little while.

If I really wasn't made cynical (for whatever reason), then that could've been a very touching moment.

For the first time, I actually heard sincerity from her. She didn't lie to me. She wasn't putting on some pleasant-mask like she usually does.

I think it's most interesting, though, that she would have never apologized for that sort of thing unless she had gotten into that fight with my father that had evidently driven her to tears.

I have always liked my mother better. Or at least disliked her less.

My father is just an asshole. Where mother can be dismissed as being emotional, there is no excuse for my father acting so puerily. He's always been an asshole.

I don't give a shit what his income is, or his position in his company. I'd rather have an umeployed father who isn't an asshole.

I hate to admit it... but I felt warmth in her embrace. I hate that. I hate it. I hate wanting to be my mother's son. I hate feeling like I owe her more than I already do.

I tried to stop myself from feeling sympathy for people I didn't like. I really thought that I had succeeded, too. Fuck me.

There's really something wrong when I can't even be totally honest to a goddamn journal.

I need to go clear my head, somehow."

I'm still brooding about all of this confusing shit, funnily enough.

I hate this.

fucking
much.

Evidently I disapprove of smoking and drinking and according to a reliable source I think people close to me are going to quit someday and want them to.

People can be really big assholes sometimes.

Last night was incredibly disturbing.

Every time I closed my eyes to go to sleep, I heard people screaming. I was still awake, but I could hear the screaming until I opened my eyes. First, it was a woman begging for a man not to kill her child. I imagined her in my mind's eye. Wounded, bleeding, on the floor. The killer holding the bloody baby by the ankle in the doorway. She would've been such a pretty woman if she wasn't begging for her life. After that, I heard a man being tortured. He was bald, but pretty young. I hate hearing men scream. I didn't even want to visualize that scene.

My friend thinks I'm schizophrenic. Maybe I am. At least then I'd know what the fuck was wrong with me.

I still have a big English project due tomorrow. I don't think I'll do it just now, though. I'm not really feeling up to it.

I'll probably just sit here for a while. I was talking to Lexi about my problems, but I doubt she'll be back online anytime soon, and clearly Matt isn't going to help me all that much tonight.

I'm really almost afraid to try sleeping tonight."

"event","I really do need to grow up.

It barely matters anymore.

But in the grand scope of things, not much really ""matters.""

Sure, some people are fortunate enough to make a difference in the world. Some are lucky enough to stand up to Death and proudly present their lives to Her, being able to say ""I became more than Just Another Grain of Sand. I <i>mattered</i> in life!""

As for the rest of us... We are free. We have the freedom to go about our meaningless existences. We have the freedom of ambition. We don't need goals. We don't need anything.

I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. All I know is that I give up. I give up trying to make some two-faced bastard happy. I give up trying to make other people value me. Why value a human? Why should anyone value anyone other than themselves?

For a moment, the word ""love"" came to mind.

I'm starting to stop believing in that word, though. It's so fleeting. It's tormentous. It's sadistic enough to enjoy it. It's sadistic enough to repeat its games until we finally just cave in under the pressure.

I suppose I give up on a lot of things. But I don't want to cave in. If I let myself become engulfed in a sort of self-pity, then I will lose to a faceless woman.

That woman's always there. I wish she would just fucking leave me alone.

He doesn't love me anymore. There is no reason to bind myself to his side. But... I don't break my promises. I can't do that. I can't become what I loathe.

I do not hate myself. I do not love myself. I just ""am.""

I've tried thinking of ways to get him to love me again. It's pointless. It's just fucking pointless. I'm so tired... I don't want to hear anymore of his lies, no matter how romantic, epic, or promising they may sound.

I just never learn. <b>I just never fucking learn.</b>

I need to grow up, apparently.

I probably do.

But what is growing up? Is it shedding something? Is it shedding myself? Is it the suicide of this so-called ""corruption?"" I will not die.

Perhaps I've been seduced.

I've been seduced often. Perhaps as often as I have tempted someone else.

But... seduced? Seduced insinuates that I walked here. It insinuates that I fell in love with this evil.

No, not seduced.

Raped.

Perhaps I did not fight it. Perhaps I, as always, allowed myself to be violated by evil. Perhaps evil isn't there. Perhaps evil is no closer to me than he is.

Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.

I never could ""know"" anything.

I feel like such a failure. A heartless devil gains his first taste of love, but spits it out because of me.

Even on other levels...

I can never be ""good enough."" I am never satisfied with myself. Others are never satisfied with me.

And when <i>I</i> surface? He cries. He begs for the one he loves back.

It makes me sick.

He hurts me. He really does. He would never touch me to harm me. Never.

But that goddamn tongue of his... And the face he hides away, deep in his stomach...

Maybe I'm just overly-sensitive. I always have been. I shouldn't be. I shouldn't be a lot of things. I probably shouldn't be writing all of this. I probably should be asleep, with all my homework done, ready to get up, put on my polo shirt, blue jeans, flip-flops, brush my teeth, eat a bowl of cereal and go to my homeschool so I can fail my classes like the normal fuck I'm supposed to be.

At least then there's security.

I hate the word ""freedom."" It's such a loaded word. It insinuates being able to do as you please. But you can never truly be free here. No one can ever truly be free here. Every child is bound by their own little drama before succumbing to their mundane lives at a later age. And then what? They die? They are born again? And then what?

What?

What?

What?

What?

What?

What?

Fucking <b>what</b>?

What happens after this is all over?

Will I be alone again?

Will I be happy?

Will I be miserable?

Will I be anything at all?

Will I burn?

Will I sleep?

Will I finally sate my lusts?

Will I be alive?

Will time finally take everything away from me? Is that it? Is that fucking it?

I don't even know who I hate anymore.

It's so easy to say you hate everything.

It's so easy to make everything in existence your enemy.

Time... Destiny... Love... Life... Good... Evil...

Everything.

I need to do something.

As expected, Matt's feelings faded. Those ""romantics"" are always the most fickle. Not to say that I don't still care about him, of course, but it really pisses me off. Imagine, a romantic who's actually sincere about what he says... ha ha ha.

Also, I discovered my mom is just as closed-minded (and as ignorant as to my true nature) as everyone else in my family. She started screaming at me in the car because I told her that the Catholic church was wrong in saying that Satanism is the act of worshipping Satan on the grounds that I was ""acting like you know everything"" and because documentaries told her that Satanism meant worshipping Satan.

Even worse is that I used the word ""lesbian"" in the car today after school and the bitch told James that I meant ""thespian."" What the fuck?! She acted as though homosexuality were some obscene thing and that school-age children (nevermind that James had used the word ""gay"" before and had shown knowledge that he knew full well what it meant) should not know of their existence. It's that kind of bullshit that keeps people from accepting each other.

Naturally, I'm extremely irritated at that woman. I was hoping that she had taken the overt clues that I didn't believe in Christianity anymore and that I was gay, but evidently she still doesn't get it.

I am very angry right now."

Naturally, it's a LiveJournal-worthy entry.

Even not counting school, today was <b>amazing.</b>

I'm a freshman again because my Algebra grade didn't get counted for some reason (to quote Mrs. LePage: ""That's ridiculous!""). So I go from having a super-homeroom to one where I don't know anybody.

I didn't see too many of my old friends today. Mostly just Amanda, Chris, Kathryn, and Jasmine. There were a few others, but I barely talked to them.

I got a really nice compliment from Thomas in chorus. It warmed my little heart.

By Geometry with Mr. Lipp (that man terrifies-yet-amuses me...), I had met two girls, Amber and Diedre. Amber went by ""Faerie,"" and convinced Diedre to make her nickname in math be ""Yami."" Faerie is quite a silly little girl. A little... spacey, to say the least... but she's a good person. I rather like those two freshmen.

There was also the Guy With The Really Cool Hair And Glasses in that class who I wanted to talk to but never did. And there was The Girl With The Temporary ID Badge and The Boy Who Kinda Looks Like Kieron But Not Really And Is Much Nicer Anyways.

Somebody winked at me in the lunch line. It was flattering. But still awkward.

I got a nice nap in Mrs. Thurlow's class. She was really nice about it when I woke up. I'll try not to do it again.

When I got home, I browsed through various websites on the internet for new clothes. I'm... going to try for slightly more showy style. Hopefully mother won't see the vinyl and forbid me to order it this time. I found these really pretty brocade pants on one website. Apparently the lady who owned and ran the site did work for black tape for a blue girl. I was rather impressed by that little tidbit.

Afterwards, I ate some stir fry. It was really fucking good. It was good in a rancid sort of way. Like scat sex. Only more delicious. And less disturbing.

I sat down at about five and opened The Dresden Dolls' Companion and started seriously learning the music with the intent of getting ""Half-Jack"" down well enough to actually play and not look like an idiot. After my parents left and I got some real privacy with my piano, I screamed my fucking head off and pounded the keys in. It was magnificent. I tried it again with ""Good Day,"" ""The Perfect Fit,"" ""Slide,"" ""Gravity,"" ""Coin-Operated Boy"" and ""Truce,"" but the only one that really reflected those magical moments was ""Slide."" 

It was... liberating."

We sort of got into a fight today, so I wanted to make it up to him. I went to World Market and got his favorite Italian imported water and two of his favorite chocolate bars with strawberry and red pepper. I'm going to take a shower just before he comes over. Wear the black shirt he's always wanted to see me wear (but hasn't yet, because it's summer and the shirt is long-sleeved).  I'll play the mix that I burned for the occassion, with ""our"" song, Tori Amos' ""Winter."" We may watch Moulin Rouge!. I'll play something on the piano for him. I'll make him biscuits. I'll fucking pamper that boy. He deserves it. After everything he's been through before meeting me, and after him putting up with my recent bitchiness... he deserves it.

All I have to worry about now are bastardised parents and irritating ""other factors"" fucking up my plans. I won't let them. I've worked too hard."

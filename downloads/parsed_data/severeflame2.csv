"event","Yeah so I guess you have all read this many time, it seems like it is the only thing important that I talk about ... (yet for something that I am so passionate about no one seems to comment on it ..) I have found the most amazing girl in the world. I know that I have had crushes in the passed where I say that they are amazing, but how well did I really know them. It seems everytime I got to know a girl last year, when I got to see deep into who they were, I was only disappointed to see that it wasn't what I wanted. I honestly though I would never find someone who could always make me feel happy, whether I was with her or not, something Elijah could tell you Kyla was never able to be... After her, I was somewhat skeptical about Kim at first. It really didn't take too long for her to really gain my trust and I knew that who she showed me was who she really was, and I liked who that was. We have only been together for about a month and I know that I am so deeply in love with her it's making my head spin, but I know that there is no one else I would rather be with. I could sit here and go over every little thing that she does that I love about her, but that is more for me to tell her and not the world. What I would do is to yell atop the tallest mountain, broadcast on every radio and tv station, hand out flyer, write in the sand and on the sidewalk, until the whole world knows that I love her, and only her. She is my everything and she completes me.I think that I would honestly die without her. And it's not like I'm falling for some girl who I haven't really known for too long, I've known her for like 9 years, and I guess this year, things just clicked, and I couldn't be more happy about the way things turned out. Yes the 3 hours between us is a pain, but it makes the time that I do get to see her so much more special and I enjoy it so much more. There will be another entry at another time about more stuff that I have been up to, but till then .. Later Dayz!"

"event","Well I've gotta say that the begining of the summer this year was kinda boring... I didn't really do much of anything. Outside of Chris, Ve, and Melissa coming up I don't think I did much more than ... well .. what I'm doing now. Not too much later after that I got my job straightened out with Staples and was working steadily about 40-45 hours a week. I still wasn't doing too much, but I was at least out of the house at work. Then things got very hectic when my grandmother grew very ill and was rushed to the hospital. She stayed in Kent Hospital for about a month and a half. Then my mom wasn't sure if she was going to go to the beach house cuz she had too much to think about... but she decided to go anyway. As many of you have prolly read, assuming people still read this, I enjoyed the beach house .. but was angry about work cuz the beach house was very relaxing this year, and it took care of a lot of my stress, but was interupted when I had to go back to work.. not to mention, by the end of the week, I had gotten a lot closer to the girl of my dreams... which just so happens to be my current girlfriend. I will get back to that in a second ... It was a good thing that she stayed for two weeks cuz the second week is when we started going out. Also that was the week of the Washinton County Fair, which was a lot of fun. It was really hot in that Pizza Booth at times, but it was worth it when they handed me a check for $400 for my 2 days of work.. in scholarship form.Then after that I was pretty much only involved in work, they had boosted me up to 50 hours a week, without asking me, but still paying me part time wages... which is bullshit.. then about 2 weeks ago I gave them my notice that my schedule would change to a really small schedule .. and what did they do .. thats right .. they gave me MORE hours ... and when I talked to my boss about it he said he didn't know that my schedule was gonna be changing at all .. like I was gonna be able to be a full time student and work MORE than full time at a shitty job... But to make a really long story short .. I got fired so I no longer have to think about that piece of shit ever again...

Well I said I would go back to the Kimmi situation so here it is... I love this girl to pieces, with no warning at all I could be in the middle of something and completely forget what I was doing and be thinking of her. I know that I have never felt so strongly for anyone or anything before. And yeah, this long distance thing is hard, but we are working around it. For example .. Thursday night I just got back from seeing her. Wednesday morning I left my house around 5 AM to drive to North Adams to see her... I was so excited the whole way up, even though I got lost temporarily in Springfield. But soon I was back on track and made it to her house by 9. I didn't even make it out of my car before she jumped on me and hugged me and kissed me... But I've gotta say that the view that she gets to see everyday is just to die for. If it weren't for my family and school I would give up what is here to go live up there... We had so much fun, even if we were just sitting around watching tv .. we were still doing it together. Words can't even describe everything I felt and saw while I was there... All I can say is that she is the most amazing girl I know, and I love her soo much and I will do EVERYTHING in my power to make sure things stay the way they are between us .. unless of course you include the miles ... I would make them shorter if I could. 

I do believe that is enough for me at the moment .. I am still exhausted from the trip, didn't sleep much cuz I knew that it was only a matter of time before I wouldn't get to see her for another while. Well I guess all that is left for me to say is .. Later Dayz!"

"event","Yeah so yesterday I had a really shitty day, like right from the start ... and it only got worse towards the end ... well until I was able to talk to Kimmi and she made it better.. So I went to work yesterday and was making sure everything went smoothly, I got out a lot of load and busted my ass to get customers satisfied .. I actually think I was also mystery shopped too, but I think I left her with a good impression and she seemed to leave happy... whether she was a mystery shop or not .. Anyway .. so I was told by my OM (Operations Manager) and my SM (Sales Manager) to talk to my GM (General Manager) about my schedule change and also about the fact that I need the next few days off for a family emergency .. so I talked to him at the end of the shift after all of the confusion of how the day went had passes, I try to negotiate so that it works for us .. and then let him know that I am part time, getting paid part time pay, and I agreed to 32 hours a week and maybe a little more, but not up to 40, when I was hired ... and also let him know that I was currently scheduled for 52 hours this week, well at first he sounded like he cared a little ... and he seemed to be ok with it, but wasnt sure how it would all work out.. well when we left the store he said .. ""So you need time off until friday this week, right? well don't bother coming in the rest of the week..."" So basically I just a little PISSED OFF right now, and last night I really wasnt in the mood to talk to anyone outside of Kimmi and my mom.. so yeah .. I'm still not really in th emood to talk .. I would much rather put Pete into the hospital perminantly ... but I promised Kimmi that I wouldn't hit him and I wouldn't cause a fight, and I wouldn't want to put her through the pain of knowing her boyfriend is in prison somewhere... plus I think it would look bad to her parents... yeah so umm .. that's it..."

"event","UGH!!! I FUCKING HATE STAPLES!!!!!! I was scheduled till like 11 today ... or last night as the case is now .. and I didn't leave till 1 AM ... now think most people that stay that late from a job it's because they close at like 11 or 12, but we close at 9!!!! Come on ... why stay 4 hours after we close, and at STAPLES! JEEZ!  Oh and it gets better .. I called out next week telling them that school starts for me .. what do they do .. schedule me for 52 FUCKING HOURS!!!! So they expect me to skip school .. which is bullshit anyway since i am not going to school but instead going to North ADams at least one of those days to see my baby, whom I miss so very very much. But what if I really was going to school next week .. do they really expect me to work THAT much during school?? are they that FUCKING nuts? so basically I will give them an ultimatum .. they can give me next week off like I asked (minus Sunday) or Sunday the 29th will be my last day of employment at Staples! either way they wont have me working next week .. Oh well sorry about taht sudden burst of I FUCKING HATE STAPLES!! but it was mildly neccessary.."

"event","Well if this isn't gonna be obvious, I miss my Kimmi. She has been away at camp all week and the best that I have been able to hear from her was a rushed email that she sent me. I had written her about 21 pages in letters, but never sent the last 7 pages since it wouldn't get to her ontime so I emailed it, well the point of it at least. I know some things need to be kept to oursleves, but I think this is ok to say, since it's a general thought... basically everything that we have shared, absolutely everything, has just seemed so natural, like this is what was supposed to happen, like it was all planned out from the beginging. I know I hate talking about anything religous, but maybe, just maybe, this could have been planned before hand .. I won't think anything more than just the dating thing could have been planned... ANYHOO, yes I miss her, I miss her dearly, more than I've missed anything and almost anybody... I knew this long distance shit was gonna be hard going into this, I made my decision. I back up my decision with these words .. she is more than 100% worth every bit of what I feel and it will only make the time in which we can be together so much more special.

Kimberly Anne Rose .. I love you!

Well, I have lost the real meaning of which I was going to post and this entry just became dedicated to Kimmi. And as if I haven't said it enough, I love her and I miss her lots. Later Dayz!"

"event","Well it seems that I have had a lot to say in here the last couple of days, whether I wrote it down or not. There has been some very happy moments to very very very very (insert ""one year later..."" sign here) very very happy moments, to sad moments, to even sadderer moments. I don't know exactly how to explain my mood.

For the good news .. well the only news that is really any of my business to insert into the journal... As everyone should have read in my last entry, I had grown very fond of a friend of mine, who, yes, is a girl. AS I said before, she means the world to me, and I now know that the feeling is mutual. That basically could only mean one thing, yes you guessed it .. Tom has a GIRLFRIEND! and a damn good one at that. Her name is Kimberly Anne Rose (which, for anyone who has seen me recently, it explains the tattoo) I will not list all or any of the reasons why I love her, other than she is just the absolute bestest, she knows why and that's the important thing.

The bad thing, since all good things have them, is that she lives nearly 3 hours away from me, and shes going home tomorrow .. well actually in about 7 or 8 hours ='( and I will miss her sooo much, like I have said before.

The very very very happy and the very very sad moments will not be shared due to the privacy of the persons involved.

I will leave off by saying Kimmi I love you sooo much and will make my best effort to see you at least once a month, and that is a promise I intend to keep. Also thank you Elijah for being such an amazing friend and allowing me to go see my girl on her last night anywhere around me, you have no idea how much it meant, both to me and her. (by the way Kimmi wanted me to thank you for understanding about .. well everything ... the concert, and today and well everything) Oh and I would also like to thank the German who tried to convert Elijah .. he was good for some entertainment.

How could something that felt so right seem to not be possible. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not sad exactly, and I'm far from depressed, I'm more ... well ... I guess I'm still floating. I will try to explain for all of you... I have been going to my beach house for 9 or 10 years now, and basically the same families have been going the same week as I do for even longer. SO over the years I have gotten to know .. well .. everybody. And I have always gotten to make friends with a couple of them all over again near the end of the week. Well, this year it was a little different. I got out of being a little shy and started talking to everyone else, before they really even remembered who I was, since I look like really different than I did last year. And I made good friends with this girl, Kim. There were feelings between the two of us, but they didn't really come out till the end of the week. Finally I got to spend all of yesterday with her, and the feelings really came out.

To make an even longer story a little shorter, I know that I care about her more than anything else and I believe that she feels similar towards me, if not the same, but she lives in North Adams, MA which is 3 hours away from me and I know that I want to continue a relationship with her, but I fear that something will go wrong or we will lose what we have. I guess I shouldn't look too far into the future and just enjoy the now.

Well I guess that's all, and the reason I am/was kinda sad is cuz shes gonna go home and I'm gonna miss her soooooo much (in case you didn't pick that up) Later Day!

"event","Yes you heard me right. My job blows... I have had the week from the shithole of hell with work and finding some things out about a couple people. One being my friend Jessie (RIP) and someone else. The only thing that has kept me from going insane this week besides Caity and Elijah coming and surprising me at work was the beach house. BUt while at the beach house I had to leave constantly to go back home to go to work. GAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! I CAN'T TAKE IT!!! I had such a good time at the beach house, it was good to spend tiome with Steve and Amanada. And I prolly would have had a boring week there too had I not had someone to talk to, and play guitar with, and watch movies with, and buy ice cream, and other stuff. Even though you will not read this most likely ... I am going to miss you a LOT, and I fear that when the year passes, so too will what happened at the beach house this year, but I will still pick you up on Wednesday. The last night is usually the most emotional, since everybody is going home the next morning, except inm my case which is that same night, and it will be till roughly next year for us all to be together again. But this year was different.. fights occured, other stuff occured, and more different other stuff occured, and I didn't want to go because of the more different other stuff (wow I couldn't be more general than that) and I know that they didn't want me to go either. Well now I''m gonna go pass out in my bed cuz I am too tired to be here...

Later Dayz!

P.S. to the one who isn't reading this (unless I give you the address) you really made my week nice, and I wish just as much as you that I didn't have to leave, and I thought it was nice that you told Alli that if you could you would let her stay, but you would let me stay first.. I am going to miss you so much and I will never forget what was felt this week, I just wish it was easier for us to keep it going. I heart you! .:smooches:."

"event","Have you ever thought about the past? Ever wished you could go back to a certain point of time and prevent something from happening, or to even relive something, maybe it was something so good that you wish that you could relive it day after day after day. BTW this is gonna be a lot of rambling so for those of you without the time to read this through, maybe it should wait till you can really read it.

Anyway I was just reading my own subprofile for no reason whatsoever, but I came accross my page titled ""Friends and Unforgetables."" I started to read everything that I had written about people. I obviously had to put something about Kyla in there back when we were together. I read it, and I remembered absolutely every moment I had written about. Even most of the stupid shit. I looked back on it, and even though it has nearly been a full YEAR since we have been together, it still seems like it was just yesterday that we were laughing at the stupid things in life. I guess when most peopel break up they say that they regret some of the things that they had said to the other person, whether it was about how much they had opened up to that other person or whatever.Personally I can't say that I regret anything I told her, especially one BIG thing that only she would really know. Maybe she wouldn't remember it at first but this was big, but I am almost certain that she wouldn't appreciate it, it did leave her speechless last time I said it.

I guess I do wish at some points that I could go back and change a couple things in history, God knows I would love to go back to February 20, 2003 and stop a group of 8 people from going to see a concert, or maybe go with them. I'm sure many of you know why that day specifically. Or maybe it would just be amazing to go back to May 23 or 28 2003. I could definitely relive both of those days forever. Maybe I could even go back to June 10 2003, that was a good day. I can't forget June 30 2003 either, although that didn't end as good as I had hoped, but all worked out in the end I assume. Maybe, given the chance, I would have loved to go back and try to change so many things. 

But then again after looking at the list of things I would like to go back to to either change or relive, the list doesn't come nearly as long as the resons not to change anything, for the fear that something on that list would be erased as well. Had I not been supremely depressed and gone to talk to Alden, I would have never met two of my closest friends, well then again, I wouldn't have met maybe 5 of my closest friends. The 5,6,7 or 8, or even more people that I can honestly call friends that I met from the crap that I've lived through, I woudn't trade for the world. Like my subprofile says, after the Kyla entry, Ve, Melissa, and Adam (not to exclude anyone else, those are just the people I was closest to around the time I wrote it) I couldn't have gotten through college the way I did without you. Maybe I would have gotten a little higher GPA wise, but only cuz I would have given up the massive ammounts of fun that we shared. Adam, next year was supposed to be the best year ever, we had everything figured out to be the best roommates ever. Things fall through and plans change. I guess for the first time in my life, I can look at everything around me and honestly say, I wouldn't have it any other way.

Although I apologize for the length of this entry, I would like to close in saying that I love all of you so very much, and I also mean those whom I did not add into this entry. Everyone on my friends list has made my life better because you were in it. I mean that for every last person on the list. However I would like some comments to this, let me know what you thought about what I said .. other than commenting about the length or my bringing up how I still love Kyla and always will =) .. anyway until next time .. Later Dayz!

"event","Yeah so there isn't much new going on with me as of yet .. I'm just doing a lot of working. But I finally broke down and listened to a band Adam said was good and I must concur that he was dead on. Their name is Fall Out Boy and they rock out.. however I've never seen them so I don't know if they rock out with their cock(s) out. OOOOOKAAAAAAY .. moving on... you should all listen to them cuz they are amazing, they don't exactly have an ""original"" sound but they are still good. I figured that I would give you lyrics to one of their songs .. don't judge their music merely on their lyrics or my word, go out and listen to them.

"event","Well I didn't really forget it, the last entry was just long enough without this. I got it in an email and it really made me think of everything and everyone who has ever been part of my life. Read this and think of how it pertains to your own life. Maybe it will make you feel better about something or someone who made you angry or sad.

People come into your life for a Reason, a Season, or a Lifetime. When you know which one it is for a person, you will know what to do for that person.

When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to meet a need you have expressed. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or spiritually. They may seem like a Godsend, and they are! They are there for the reason you need them to be.

Then, without any wrong doing on your part, or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away. Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand. What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered, and now it is time to move on.

Some people come into your life for a SEASON, because your turn has come to share, grow, or learn. They bring you an experience of peace, or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it! It is real! But, only for a season.

LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons: things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person, and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life. It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.


You know, it kinda makes me feel a little better about the Kyla thing. God knows I still love her and would do nearly anything for her. I guess she was there only fulfill a prayer of mine and was only gonna be there for a short time. And I will assume the same with Murphy, had it not been for him, I would have never met some of my bestest best friends in the whole world. And had it not been for Marissa .. well.. I don't think I was any better off after finding her, but maybe it was a little to my advantage to get some of the guys off my back when I kept answering no to ""So Tom, do you have a girlfriend?"" Then the girls chime in .. ""yeah and we can see why.."" followed by laughter. I didn't really like the first maybe 12 years of my life .. except I found the best friend I will ever have when I was four, and I mean no disrespect to any of my other friends esspecially Elijah, you have been there for me when I thought there was no one to be found. I can't say I love one of you more than the other .. there are just things that me and Steve do that would make me uncomfortable doing around anyone else. Beach House holds MANY secrets.. Anyway night all..."

"event","Duty, Loyalty, Honor, Courtesy, Sincerity, Courage, Justice, and Morality... what do these words mean to you? Are they just words? Or are they what you live your life with? Don't jump to any conclusions here ... I'm not here telling anyone they aren't living their lives the right way .. I just want you to think. Could go everyday living only by those eight words. Would you be able to honestly say to someone that if they thought you were of no use to them anymore that you would gladly take your own life. Would you believe me if I told you that there were hundreds and thousands that drank, breathed, slept, and bled nothing but those things. I know most of you wouldn't be surprised by this, maybe even more than one of you could even understand the subject .. no, as you may have noticed it is not in English. Those ways of life come directly from the Samurai Code of Conduct. I'm sure some of you already knew that though.

Anyway, the thing that brings me to this is that I actually was really bored the other day and went out to finally humor Ve, and I rented ""The Last Samurai"" starring Tom Cruise. I finally got to watch it this afternoon. I must agree with Veronica, that it gets added to the top of my favorite movies of all time. It is up there with ""We Were Soldiers"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and we all know how much of a sucker I am for war films. The tradition used was unbelievably breathtaking, and the storyline was impeccable. It also holds one of my new favorite comebacks ... for those who watched the movie and would remember it .. it's the part at the end after Katsumoto had died, Captain Algren presents Emperor Meiji with Katsumoto's sword. Emperor Meiji turns to Omura, after declining the American weaponry offer, and says that he will be stripping him and his family of their assets and giving it to the Emperor's people. When Omura angrily yells that it is a disgrace to him, Emperor Meiji turns to him and says ""If it is that shameful I offer to you this sword."" ... it was just too good.BUt the presentation of it was just too good .. the whole movie moved me to the point of tears .. not many movies do that.

So to end this off I would like to say .. I commend you on an excellent movie Edward Zwick and John Logan ... and I commend you, Ve, for recommending such an amazing movie... I am off to discover more about the way of the Samurai... Later Dayz!

P.S. 18 Dayz Left for me..."

"event","Yup that's right we finally got a ""finalized"" lineup for August 19th 2004 Warped Tour at Foxboro ... however the 20th is still trying to .. well .. exist. For those of you who have no clue what I'm talking about, Boston was the lucky winnr of TWO Warped Tour dates this year .. one on the 19th and the other the day after. Both were scheduled for the same place. Well, it turns out that everything is fine with the first date ... but the city of Foxboro is not ok with having a second day of insane cleanup, so they are not giving permission for the 10th Aniversary show on the 20th. While there is no confirmed show as of yet .. Warped Tour Reps are working as hard as they can to get the date added back to the list... But without any more hesitation .. the August 19th 2004 Warped Tour lineup!!

IF I KNEW
 
If I knew it would be the last time
That I'd see you fall asleep,
I would tuck you in more tightly
and pray the Lord, your soul to keep.
 
If I knew it would be the last time
that I see you walk out the door,
I would give you a hug and kiss
and call you back for one more.

If I knew it would be the last time
I'd hear your voice lifted up in praise,
I would video tape each action and word,
so I could play them back day after day.
 
If I knew it would be the last time,
I could spare an extra minute
to stop and say ""I love you,""
instead of assuming you would KNOW I do.
 
If I knew it would be the last time
I would be there to share your day,
Well I'm sure you'll have so many more,
so I can let just this one slip away.

For surely there's always tomorrow
to make up for an oversight,
and we always get a second chance
to make everything just right.
 
There will always be another day
to say ""I love you,""
And certainly there's another chance
to say our ""Anything I can do?""
 
But just in case I might be wrong,
and today is all I get,
I'd like to say how much I love you
and I hope we never forget.

Tomorrow is not promised to anyone,
young or old alike,
And today may be the last chance
you get to hold your loved one tight.
 
So if you're waiting for tomorrow,
why not do it today?
For if tomorrow never comes,
you'll surely regret the day,
 
That you didn't take that extra time
for a smile, a hug, or a kiss
and you were too busy to grant someone,
what turned out to be their one last wish.
 
So hold your loved ones close today,
and whisper in their ear,
Tell them how much you love them
and that you'll always hold them dear

Take time to say ""I'm sorry,""
""Please forgive me,"" ""Thank you,"" or ""It's okay.""
And if tomorrow never comes,
you'll have no regrets about today.

"event","Yeah so I had a lot of things that I coud have been doing, like Kyle's party that I REALLY wanted to go to, or going out to the Liquid Lounge with Giggy, his girlfriend, and some people from work (prolly Nick, Joe, Mike, and Joelle .. but I wans't told) but I went out with the family instead. We had a great time tho, not like July 2nd isn't always fun, it was just better this year. Alli actually had something to keep her busy and not complain. I do however feel bad, cuz I really wanted to see Kyle, since I've only really seen him that one day that he came to visit me at work with Ashley and Meryn. I also feel bad cuz Giggy has tried to get me to go out with the gang for a couple weeks now and I've just been busy when he wants to get together... like when he wanted to go to the beach last Tuesday maybe .. but I was doing something much more important when he wanted to go .. at like 7 or something at night.BUt back to what I did ... It was also really good to see Amanda again. Hun, I do think that you had WAY too much sugar ... but it was still fun. I'm glad we get to hang out ever now and then, it's good to actually have gotten to meet one of Steve's girlfriends. This may seem weird, but it kinda makes me feel like I'm still part of Steve's life even though we have both kinda split in our separate ways. I don't know .. I think that sounded weird .. I hope you know what I'm saying... anyhoo .. was a good night, had a lot of fun, and now I have a full weekend of work...

25 Dayz Left ... I'M HALFWAY THERE!!!

lol... now you know what the countdown is for Amanda .. or you at least have a clue...

Later Dayz!"

"event","Well, I don't know how long I will be staying at Staples, one of my managers is really pissing me off .. I will at least stick it out for the summer .. after all I need the money. 

Anyhoo ... What I wanted to say is that after a certain point the thing that I am counting down for just gets soo much easier. 

Ok, now I have to put this in here .. there are some people that I REALLY have to see cuz I miss them too much ... Adam, even though he doesn't check this anymore, it has been way way way to long. Also I need to see Melissa and Ve again, cuz I miss them both dearly. I should prolly go see Steve sometime too, cuz I love him and if I don't see him then that's my fault since I live so close to him. And while I'm at it I will say hi to his girlfriend Amanda ... whom I don't think reads this either ... but I don't blame her if she doesnt feel like commenting. Also Ve, I really need to talk to you ... I suppose I could just put it here, after all it will eventually be up here .. it's just a matter of time. I was gonna tell you when you came up here on Saturday, but you were working.

Umm.. I dont think I have anything left to say other than ...

"event","Really tough day at work, but I guess it feels good. I'm actually doing something with my time, and I'm not just sitting around the house doing nothing. Tonight is one of those nights that you just feel like sitting down watching TV and cracking open a beer, or something like that, and putting on this song... and oldie, but one of the best songs ever made...

<marquee behavior=""alternate"">Lyrics of the Day</marquee>

<center>It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

He says, ""Son, can you play me a melody?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

La la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me.""
As the smile ran away from his face
""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

Oh, la la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy who's still in the navy
And probably will be for life

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

Oh, la la la, de de da
La la, de de da da da

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

I have Thursday off (for the moment) so it looks like I will be going to The Doug Out in Hope Valley to watch a 3:00 show with my friends from knuckleDown and my new friends from Imprint, as well as some band from Michigan. If anyone is interested in going, let me know if you need directions .. or at least the address to find your own directions. I said for the moment because that could change, my lead, Chris, got off of work yesterday and was immediatly got a phone call from the hospital telling him that his father had just died. So I may be taking over his shifts .. if he isn't working on Thursday then it's no problem, but I'm trying to be as helpful as I can be. Which brings me to my next set of business .. three days on the job and I am already up for a prmotion from Office Supplies to Electronics and Furniture .. not too shabby huh?? Yeah that's what I thought .. but it's still just talk at the moment .. the real celebrating will come when/if I get my notification of the promotion.

"event","Yes another weekend gone .. but this one put to good use. First things first, my job at Staples is going well .. at least for the three days that I've been in so far, and out of those three days I think I was able to get together 19 or 20 hours of work on ""short shifts."" This coming week I am working only 26 hours. SO I will prolly be looking at like $150 or so for next week and maybe $115 this week.

Now for the more important part. Melissa came up on Friday, which made me so very happy cuz I missed her lots. We went to YMCA Rockhouse to see my buddy Ryan and his band knuckleDown play. It started out crappy, first cuz we were surrounded by some of the most immature kids in the school system, then they found out that they had a broken PA with them and had to get another one there as quickly as they could. Then we were left in a small room with those wonderful immature monkies. We ended up leaving and going to see Sara at work for a little bit. When we got back we were just in time to catch the end of Leah Stargazing, and we saw Imprint. They were good but something sounded off. The knuckleDown came on and they had a really kick ass performance. Melissa and I helped Ryan take some of his stuff to his truck and then everyone from Flatline, Imprint, and knuckleDown as well as Melissa and I went out to Denny's in Coventry and I think we were there till like 1:30 or something like that. We got back to my place and Melissa slept over. I don't know when she woke up but my mom woke me up at like 12:30 so that she wouldn't feel awkward.

Then later that night I went to Applebee's in South Kingston for Becky's ""surprise"" party. I was told that I was supposed to be there no later than 7:30, so I get there at like 7:25 or a little earlier only to find that I WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE!!! Yes I lived the farthest away but I was still the first one there for a while. Then 10 minutes later Ted got there, and he lives not too far from me, but still closer to it than me. Him and I were sitting alone for almost 10 to 15 minutes alone until the next group of people got there. But the best part was when Becky got there, She noticed Caity and her aunt when she walked in and waved to them, but still had no idea what was going on. She walked around the corner to see like 23 of her friends and family sitting together and she was just like... ""hey everyone what's up"" and it wasn't until we all said ""SURPRISE!!"" that she figured out why basically everyone important to her was sitting there together ... I think she said ""this is straight up craziness"" like 27 or 28 times before the food came. So yeah it was really good to see Bex again, as well as Tedward and Caity. And I guess it was good to see John (her brother) again even though we didn't really acknowledge each other existence the whole night. I wouldn't consider us friends, but we are definitely not enemies.

Yeah so it may be a bit long but that was my weekend in short. Now for something that hasn't been around lately ...

<marquee>Lyrics Of The Day:</marquee>

""And you've
got to change stories quickly, 
quickly fill these heads with lies.
Its okay as long as you blameless in their eyes. 
And you know 
that you were never right. 

You flaunt it and they want it, 
but they know that the inside's hollow. 
You went for what you can't have. 
Here's you line, and these lies they follow. 

You flaunt it and they want it, 
but they know that the inside's hollow. 
You went for what you can't have. 
Here's you line, and these lies they follow.

So I went into your room 
but you know that nothing was asked for. 
Who was the one who was kissing the others' neck? 
And who was the one that was wishing that we shared a speck 
of feelings for one another? 
Under the covers, 
you threw yourself at me, a
nd I could have had you easily, 
I'm sorry but this ins one time shot down.

You flaunt it and they want it, 
but they know that the inside's hollow. 
You went for what you can't have. 
Here's you line, and these lies they follow.

You flaunt it and they want it, 
but they know that the inside's hollow. 
You went for what you can't have. 
Here's you line, and these lies they follow.

SO TRY TO TURN THIS ALL AROUND!!

You flaunt it and they want it, 
but they know that the inside's hollow. 
You went for what you can't have. 
Here's you line, and these lies they follow.

You flaunt it and they want it, 
but they know that the inside's hollow. 
You went for what you can't have. 
Here's you line, and these lies they follow.""

"event","Yeah so I find myself tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep. Actually I'm dead tired and I just can't fall asleep ... maybe I'm just to anxious for work to start. AS of tomorrow I am the one of the two newest additions to the Staples establishment. I would tell people to come by and bug me, however I will be working in back and in the offices in merchandising. Plues I have no idea which days I will be working or when I will ever get breaks, assuming I will have some.

Ya know in all of the craziness of life I had forgotten just how beautiful a sunrise is. Last night marked the third night in a row that I was awake for sunrise, that is before I even went to bed .. basically saying I've been going to bed at like 6:30 every morning. The only other time previous that I can remember watching the sunrise was such a beatuiful night. I spent the night at Kyla's, it was the night of her prom. We had a good time (at least she said she had a good time) and then we watched some movies and went to bed. we never really went to sleep, but finally around 5 a.m. or so while we were both still lying in her bed, we decided to watch the sunrise. It was so beautiful, her in my arms, watching God proclaim the new day. I guess she was worn out, or maybe 5 in the morning was too late for her to stay awake, but she fell asleep in my arms. Even after everything I went through because of her, I can still look back at those memories and say that they were some of my favorites.

Well I guess I'm putting off sleeping for enough time already, so I am gonna try to sleep now. Later Dayz!"

"event","Yeah so not only do I have way too much time on my hands but I think I have found my calling .. and I don't even mean something I'm good at .. at least I'm not yet .. but I at least found something that I can be completely passionate about, and I find myself just dreaming that I could be doing that all day .. and just my luck, I can't get into it for nearly 4 months. I have always loved some of the sitcoms on TV like Law & Order and variations of it, ER, and now Third Watch. Oddly enough even before I joined EMS, those were the only shows I felt were worth watching. Tonight was no different, but I was watching Third Watch was about firefighters that were called to a fire .. how surprising huh?? ... well this fire was basically nothing .. but three squads were sent. Because the building was nearly a dead zone and one of the radios wasn't working correctly, they didn't get a line up to the fire in time, and the fire spread. Throughout the night, the fire spread throughout the entire building, eventually with the building caving in on itself. In the show .. that fire killed 3 firefighters. As I sit there watching all of this happen, as I start to feel something, as if it were a real story, and I was watching it happen, I snapped back to reality (don't get into the lecture of me having to separate myself from my TV shows) and I quickly realized that there are people that do this kinda thing everyday, and they put their lives on th eline to save a couple more. That is when I felt proud to be part of the EMS, I know the show was about the fire department and not a college EMS station, but it amounts to the same thing, there will eventually be a call that I go on, be it with URI EMS, SKEMS, or Charleston (the later two if I plan to furhter my work) where I may have to go on a call which I have no idea if something will happen and I could possibly risk my life to save someone elses, but just the fact that when I do get a call, I am part of a team whose only misson is to save someone's life. I think that God has called me to do this, at least for now. Who knows, maybe you might see me change my career objective, but I don't think I'm called to go that far. BUt while I was sitting here, realizing that I couldn't be happier with a job than with the one I have waiting for me when I get back to school, I found this ... I want to hear what you guys think of it, give me your honest input, whatever little it may be... even if you hate it.

<marquee behavior=""alternate"">An EMS Prayer</marquee>

As I perform my duty Lord 
Whatever be the call, 
Help to guide and keep me safe 
From dangers big and small. 

I want to serve and do my best 
No matter what the scene, 
I pledge to keep my skills refined, 
My judgement quick and keen. 

This calling to give of my self 
Most do not understand, 
But I stand ready all the time 
To help my fellow man. 

To have the chance to help a child 
Restore his laugh with glee, 
A word of thanks I might not hear, 
But knowing is enough for me. 

The praise of men is fine for some, 
But I feel truly blessed, 
That you oh Lord have chosen me 
To serve in EMS

Watch you on the one's and two's.
Through a window in a well lit room.
Become a recluse.
And I blame myself because I make things hard
and you're just trying to help.
And when I wake up you're the first to call.
This is one more late night basement song.
I'm so sore.
My voice has gone to hell.
And this is one more sleepless night because... 

We don't believe in filler.
Baby, if I could I'd sit this out.

(This is over when I say it's over)
This is a lesson in procrastination.
I kill myself because I'm so frustrated.
Every single second that I put it off 
Means another lonely night I got to race the clock.
I ignore it and it ignores me too.
What say we go crash you car?
And every time I leave you go and lock the door.
So I walk myself picking at a chip on my shoulder.
I'm another day late and one year older.
It's failure by design.

And we just want sleep.
But this night is hell.
I'm sick and sunk and I blame myself because I make things hard
and you're just trying to help.
I got no gas. (No Gas)
I'm winding out my gears.
This is one more day on the verge of tears.
And now my head hurts. ( Head hurts)
And my health is a joke.
Now I got to stop because the headphones broke.

We don't believe in filler.
Baby, if I could I'd sit this out.

(This is over when I say it's over).

I'm another day late and one year older.
It's failure by design.

I'm out of everything.
But no one sleeps till 
we get this shit out on the shelves.
It's late. I'm faltering.
But this time I got nothing to say besides: 
Do Do Do. Do Do Do.
Do Do Do. Do Do Do. (Get this shit out on the shelf)
Do Do Do. Do Do Do.
Do Do Do. Do Do Do.(Get This shit out on the shelf)
Do Do Do. Do Do Do.
Do Do Do. Do Do Do.(Get this shit out on the shelf)
Do Do Do. Do Do Do.
Nothing to say besides!

"event","So yes, as I just said .. it is finally Summer. I have done basically nothing but eat, sleep, and sit on my ass thyus far.. 'cept I do now have a job at Staples making $7.00/hr and 32 hr/week. So what better way to really kick off the summer than one KICK ASS day. That day just so happened to be yesterday, which by now is now two days ago (Thursday.) It started much like everyday has for me so far ...  wake up at 8 am, bring my sister to school, get home, and take a shower. The first difference in <i>this</i> day was that before the ""get home"" part could happen I had to drop off my car at Steve's (my mechanic) to do some work. Then once my shower was done, I did a little bit of extra cleaning around the house. At about noon Ve showed up with Chris. The original plan was for it to just be me and her, but the more the merrier .. and it may have been a little wierd for the both of us to just spend the day together as we did, just the two of us even though neither of us are attracted to the other one.

So, the first thing we did was go to my room and watch some Invader Zim episodes. Ve had never seen Invader Zim, but had read comics written by Jhonen Vasquez so she knew she would like it. I think she liked it and now she understands more about my LJ picture. Then after that we went to my bank, and then form there we went to Barnes & Noble's to pick up a DVD that I ordered. We went to Chris' house since he needed to do stuff for his parents at his house. He had to be there when some packages came, but they were already there once we got there. I helped him move the boxes into another room and then he made us all mac and cheese. While eating the mac & cheese I opened my new DVD and me and Ve and Chris watched ""Eddie Izzard: Dressed To Kill"" and they were introduced to my favorite comedian. For people who have never heard of/seen Eddie Izzard perform, his cometic style is similar to that of Dane Cook, and if you have never heard of him .. then you are shit outta luck, cuz they are pretty damn original comedians. From what I saw .. Ve and Chris enjoyed him... maybe that was from Ve's hysterical laughter through about half of the performance. We still have yet to watch the complete thing, so that should give at least her another excuse to come up and see me, not that she needs an excuse.

Next we came back to my house and got her some gas .. I will assume that the $10 that I put in her tank was enough to get her home. Then right after that we went to Pizza Hut for dinner. It was really good. After we were done eating, we went back to my house for a little bit and I introduced them to another good comedian, George Carlin. After about 30 minutes, which for as much as I love him it is as long as he is good for, we stopped watching Carlin and started to head off to Providence for the REAL fun of the night. Funny how once we got there it was Ve's Idea to go to the strip club, even though she was only joking. 

We got to the theater around 9:50ish. The show started at 10 pm .. or at least it was suposed to. I don't know when it actually started, but when it got under way it was a great show. For those of you who didn't know what the plan was, we went to Improv Jones. And for those of you who don't know what that is, it is a live show that is much related to the show ""Who's Line Is It Anyway?"" and for those of you who don't know what that is .. you are not only shit outta luck again, but you should prolly stop living under that rock of yours, it can't be healthy for you. Sean Sullivan, my class president from TG my senior year, was one of the performers. And Dominic, my personal favorite, sorry Sean, was also one of the performers. I guess he wasn't as good as I saw him the first time, but he they also didn't do more than two pieces this time, so his talent wasn't able to be used completely. Overall the show was great, and from what I was told, Ve and Chris enjoyed that too.

This morning Chris and I woke up at 8:00 am, and Ve woke up at 8:15. BY 8:30 we were on our way to Denny's to get some breakfast. Not much to say about that, other than it was enjoyable. It was a good ending to a great day of plans. Chris had to be home again by 10 am. I would have rather slept till then .. or past then, but it was all the same to me and was no trouble. I had wished that we could have at leat hung out a little longer, but alas he really did need to get home. Both of them are definitely welcome back to visit anytime, as well as just about anybody else. But also are more than welcome to come back to have another night at Improv Jones.

Oh yes, and I know this entry is already long enmough but I will keep my promise to my Caity. On the same sday as that ast entry, Saturday I beleve, the most important part of the day was when I got to see her. We went to Brewed Awakening, and it was pretty good. It would have been nice to hang out with her longer that day too, but alas she actually does something with her time .. unlike me who prolly broke the record for most consecutive hours sitting on his ass. Oh well, now that I have posted .. I think I will go to bed .. there is nothing else to do anyway. Night All .. Later Dayz!"

"event","Yeah so I'm in a really wierd mood right now. I have been very happy lately .. at first I didn't really know why and didn't care, but as time went on I got happier and happier, but still had no clue why. I mean I know that my first yuear of college is over, and that is awesome... SUMMER IS HERE!!! And I know throughout all of the good that summer brings I am .. or will be sad to see some people go, as I stated in my last entry. While I am still in this giddy-ish mood, I would like to bring you sttention to a quote from a long ago that I tried to bring back, but haven't felt like it has gotten its point across of how awesome it is ... so here it is for you once again ... ""Get off your knees ref, you're blowing the game!"" Now after saying that I think you would need to hear the whole story but I'm not in the mood to tell it, so Elijah feel free to inform people of the story in a comment if you wish.

I have become very contemplative in the last couple hours I've ben staring at my computer screen. I believe that because of thi such intense feeling of happy that an intense depression will come sooner or later to balance it off. I have also realized I guess, thanks to a certain talk, how much I am loved by my friends, the ones who have been by my side throughout all of the shit I call my life, which, don't get me wrong, is a better life than some and better than I give it credit for sometimes. I guess there lies one of the causes of my happiness. Although I am loved, I wish to be loved ( as Catiy wishes to be loved) but I guess I can deal without that love for a bit longer.

Anyway, I have a job interview at Staples tomorrow at noon, I hope I get the job. I guess if that falls through I could always check out petsmart or petco or target or something like that. Anyway Wish me luck .. even though I will probably not see who wished me luck till after it is over... wish me luck anyway at any time.

Well Until we meet again, Later Dayz!"

"event","People are starting to talk more about the end of the school year so I feel that it is only logical that I should give my penny and a half... Yes it is true, the school year is almmost over .. just a couple more exams and we are all through. Even EMS can't stop talking about the end of the year. We officially go OOS (Out Of Service) May 15th at 13:00, one hour after dorms close.

The point of this was to say how much I will miss everyone. Forgive me if I do not put everyone in here .. I'm in a little bit of a hurry. 

Melissa and Ve, you guys have been like sisters to me all year. We have had such a fun year esspecially the killing me part that became a ritual nearly every other night. Then there were the times when we would go out to eat and I wouldn't let you guys pay .. for example Spikes and Applebees. Those were some good times. I also can't thank you guys enough for accompanying me and my family to the service for Station Fire vitcims. You guys were truely a big help to my whole family and it gained you guys mucho respect in the eyes of my uncles and aunts and cousins ... you already had respect from my parents. I love you both soo much and I will miss you guys possibly the most.

Adam, you were definitely my right hand man in college. We should have been room mates next year but I hate those bastards. IT would have been sooo much fun. Anyway I think this year went well, we had our wonderous little band .. which never should have started .. but it was fun for the whole 2 seconds we took it seriously. I'm sure we will have loads of fun next year .. and maybe we will get a real band going. I will definitely miss you over the summer .. I will have to come down at some point to visit.

Sara, I'm glad we started hangong out more .. we had some fun times. I hope you enjoy all of the episodes of Invader Zim that I got for you .. another CD is on its way I swear. We have had our times of seriousness, but it was more fun times rather than serious moments. Like taking apart the Fine Arts building.. Well I love you hun and hopefully we can get together at some point during the summer so I don't have to miss you too much.

I know there are some people that I forgot like Chris and Ashley and a lot of people who dont have journals, but at the moment I am WAY too tired to continue and I'm not gonna say that I will come back and finish later cuz I've said that in the past and just forgot , so I will say this .. maybe I will finish but don't be surprsed if I don't. Now it's off to bed.. Later Dayz!"

"event","I felt this was good for all to read, and rather than show you where to look which is becoming more and more of a hassle I thought I would just move it here. Ve now you don't have to look for it anymore it's right here, then you can tell me what you think about it after you're done. 

This was taken from the EMS community that I'm in ... it's quite long but please read the whole thing ... come back to it if you have to ... it is hilarious.

EMS Laws
Anyone who has ever worked on an ambulance for even a short time can relate to many of these ""Laws"".

This little list was given to me by a friend. It stated at the top the author was unknown, so if someone has copyrighted this material please let me know before you call the feds.
 

THE FIRST LAW OF EMS: 
All Emergency calls will wait until you begin to eat, regardless of the time 
COROLLARY 1 -- Fewer accidents would occur if EMS personnel would never eat. 
COROLLARY 2 -- Always order food ""to go"". 

THE PARAMEDICAL LAWS OF TIME: 
1. There is absolutely no relationship between the time at which you are supposed to get off shift and the time at which you will get off shift. 
2. Given the following equation: 
T + 1 Minute = Relief Time 
""T"" will always be the time of the last call of your shift. E.g., if you are supposed to get off shift at 1900, your last run will come in at 1859. 

THE PARAMEDICAL LAW OF GRAVITY: 
Any instrument, when dropped, will always come to rest in the least accessible place possible. 

THE PARAMEDICAL LAW OF TIME AND DISTANCE: 
The distance of the call from the Hospital increases as the time to shift change decreases. 
COROLLARY 1 -- The shortest distance between the station and the scene is under construction. 

THE PARAMEDICAL RULE OF RANDOM SIMULTANEITY: 
The emergency calls will randomly come in all at once. 

THE RULE OF RESPIRATORY ARREST: 
All patients, for whom Mouth-to-Mouth Resuscitation must be provided, will have just completed a large meal of Barbecue and Onions, Garlic Pizza, and Pickled Herring, which was washed down with at least three cans of Beer. 

THE AXIOM OF LATE-NIGHT RUNS: 
If you respond to any Motor Vehicle Accident call after Midnight and do not find a drunk on the scene, keep looking -- somebody is still missing. 

THE LAW OF OPTIONS: 
Any patient, when given the option of either going to Jail or going to the Hospital by a Police Officer, will always be inside the Ambulance before you are. 
COROLLARY 1 -- Any patient who chooses to go to Jail instead of the Hospital probably knows you're the driver. 

THE FIRST RULE FO EQUIPMENT: 
Any piece of Lifesaving Equipment will never malfunction or fail until: 
1. You need it to save a life, or 
2. The salesman leaves. 

THE SECOND RULE OF EQUIPMENT: 
Interchangeable parts don't, leak proof seals will, and self-starters won't. 

THE FIRST LAW OF AMBULANCE DRIVING: 
No matter how fast you drive the Ambulance when responding to a call, it will never be fast enough, unless you pass a Police Cruiser, at which point it will be entirely too fast. 

PARAMEDICAL RULES OF THE BATHROOM: 
1. If a call is received between 0500 and 0700, the location of the call will always be in a Bathroom. 
2. If you have just gone to the Bathroom, no call will be received. 
3. If you have not just gone to the Bathroom, you will soon regret it. 
4. The probability of receiving a run increases proportionally to the time elapsed since last going to the Bathroom. 

THE BASIC PRINCIPLE FOR DISPATCHERS: 
Assume that all field personnel are idiots until their actions prove your assumption. 

BASIC ASSUMPTION ABOUT DISPATCHERS: 
Given the opportunity, any Dispatcher will be only too happy to tell you where to go, regardless of whether or not (s)he actually knows where that may be. 
COROLLARY 1 -- The existence or non-existence of any given location is of only minor importance to a Dispatcher. 
COROLLARY 2 -- Any street designated as a ""Cross-Street"" by a Dispatcher probably isn't. 
COROLLARY 3 -- If a street name CAN be mispronounced, a Dispatcher WILL mispronounce it. 
COROLLARY 4 -- If a street name CANNOT be mispronounced, a Dispatcher WILL mispronounce it. 
COROLLARY 5 -- A Dispatcher will always refer to a given location in the most obscure manner as possible. E.g., ""Stumpy Brown's Cabbage Field"" is now covered by a shopping center. 

THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF TRIAGE: 
In any accident, the degree of injury suffered by a patient is inversely proportional to the amount and volume of agonized screaming produced by that patient. 

THE GROSS INJURY RULE: 
Any injury, the sight of which makes you sick, should immediately be covered by 4x4s and Kerlix. 

THE RULE OF FUNDING AND DONATIONS: 
All Funding and Donations are received in amounts which are inversely proportional to need. 

THE FIRST LAW OF EMS SUPERVISORS: 
Given the equation: 
X - Y = Quality of Care 
where ""X"" is the care that you render and ""Y"" is the assistance supplied by any Supervisor. If you can eliminate ""Y"" from the equation, the Quality of Care will improve by ""X"". 
COROLLARY 1 -- Generally, Field Supervisors have no business in the Field. 
COROLLARY 2 -- The level of technical competence is inversely proportional to the level of management. 
COROLLARY 3 -- Technology is dominated by those who manage what they do not understand. 

THE LAW OF PROTOCOL DIRECTIVES: 
The simplest Protocol Directive will be worded in the most obscure and complicated manner possible. Speeds, for example, will be expressed as ""Furlongs per Fortnight"" and flow rates as ""Hogsheads per Hour"". 
COROLLARY 1-- If you don't understand it, it must be intuitively obvious. 
COROLLARY 2 -- If you can understand it, you probably don't. 

THE LAW OF EMS EDUCATORS: 
Those who can't do, teach. 

THE LAW OF EMS EVALUATORS: 
Those who can neither do nor teach, evaluate. 

THE PARAMEDICAL LAW OF LIGHT: 
As the seriousness of any given injury increases, the availability of light to examine that injury decreases. 

THE PARAMEDICAL LAW OF SPACE: 
The amount of space which is needed to work on a patient varies inversely with the amount of space which is available to work on that patient. 

THE PARAMEDICAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY: 
The number of distraught and uncooperative relatives surrounding any given patent varies exponentially with the seriousness of the patent's illness or injury. 

THE PARAMEDICAL THEORY OF WEIGHT: 
The weight of the patient that you are about to transport increases by the square of the sum of the number of floors which must be ascended to reach the patient plus the number of floors which must be descended while carrying the patient. 
COROLLARY 1 -- Very heavy patients tend to gravitate toward locations which are furthest from mean sea level. 
COROLLARY 2 -- If the patient is heavy, the elevator is broken, and the lights in the stairwell are out. 

THE RULES OF NO-TRANSPORT: 
1. A Life-or-Death situation will immediately be created by driving away from the home of a patient whom you have just advised to go to the hospital in a private vehicle. 
2. The seriousness of this situation will increase as the date of your trial approaches. 
3. By the time your ex-patient reaches the witness stand, the Jury will wonder how a patient in such terrible condition could have possibly walked to the door and greeted you with a large suitcase in each hand. 

THE FIRST RULE OF BYSTANDERS: 
Any bystander who offers you help will give you none. 

THE SECOND RULE OF BYSTANDERS: 
Always assume that any Physician found at the scene of an emergency is a Gynecologist, until proven otherwise. 
COROLLARY 1 -- NEVER turn your back on a Proctologist. 

THE RULE OF WARNING DEVICES: 
Any Ambulance, whether it is responding to a call or traveling to a Hospital, with Lights and Siren, will be totally ignored by all motorists, pedestrians, and dogs which may be found in or near the roads along its route. 
COROLLARY 1 -- Ambulance Sirens can cause acute and total, but transient, deafness. 
COROLLARY 2 -- Ambulance Lights can cause acute and total, but transient, blindness. 
NOTE 
This Rule does not apply in Massachusetts, where all pedestrians and motorists are apparently oblivious to any and all traffic laws. 

THE LAW OF SHOW-AND-TELL: 
A virtually infinite number of wide-eyed and inquisitive school-aged children can climb into the back of any Ambulance, and, given the opportunity, invariably will. 
COROLLARY 1 -- No emergency will come in until they are all inside the Ambulance and playing with the equipment. 
COROLLARY 2 -- It will take at least four times as long to get them all out as it took to get them in. 
COROLLARY 3 -- A vital piece of equipment will be missing. 

THE RULE OF ROOKIES: 
The true value of any rookie EMT, when expressed numerically, will always be a negative number. The value of this number may be found by simply having the rookie grade his or her ability on a scale from 1 to 10. For rookie EMT's in the back of the vehicle: 
1 = Certified Health Hazard 
10 = Member, ACEP 
and for rookie EMT's driving the vehicle: 
1 = Obstruction to Navigation 
10 = Mario Andretti 

The true value of the rookie is then found by simply negating the rookie's self-assigned value 
COROLLARY 1 -- Treat any rookie EMT assigned to your Unit as you would a Bystander (see The First Rule of Bystanders, above). 

THE RULE OF RULES: 
As soon as an EMS Rule is accepted as absolute, an exception to that Rule will immediately occur."

"event","As I promised to the magificant Caity, I do have a dedication for her, I also have one for two other people. Instead of making two separate entried I will combine them, the first specifically for Caity and the second part for Caity as well as any other person, goy or girl, who has ever felt that there was a flaw of theirs that made them less important, I guess the two people that have kinda voiced a similar opinion of themselves that stick out to me are Melissa and Sara. Anyway here are my dedications.

to Caity: ( this is coming from an e-card so it is a little mushy)

Hun, do you know how important you have become to me, how much I believe in you, how special you are, I am so grateful to have a REAL friend like you. You have brightened my life in so many ways. You are always there for me and I just wanted you to know that I will always be there for you, in good times and bad. I hope this brightened your day, and know how much you are loved. Your friendship is very special to me!


To Caity, Melissa and Sara: (Caity you were the first person I ever sent this to so you should remember it sorta.)

This comes from a very insightful story that acutally my great grandmother used to tell me, evenbefore I saw it as an e-card as well ... let alone even know what the internet was at the time.

A water bearer in India had two large pots, each hungon each end ofa pole, which he carries across his neck. One of the pots had a crack in it. The other pot was perfect. While the perfect pot always delivered a full portion of water at the end of the long wlak from the stream to the master's house, the cracked pot arrived only half full. For a full two years this went on daily, with the bearer delivering only one and a half pots full of water in his master's house. Of course the perfect pot was proud of its accomplishments, perfect for the end for which it was made. But the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imprefetion, and miserable that it was able to accomplish only half of what it had been made to do. After two years of what it percieved to be a bitter failure, it spoke to the water bearer one day by the stream. ""I am ashamed of myself and I want to appologize to you.""  ""Why?"" asked the bearer. ""What are you ashamed of?""  The pot said. ""I have been able, for these past two years, to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side causes water to leakout all the way back to your masters house. Because of my flaws, you do all of this work, and you dont get full value from your efforts,"" The water bearer felt sorry for the old cracked pot, and in compassion he said, ""As we return to my masters house, I want you to notice the beautiful wild flowers along the path."" Indeed, as they went up the hill, the old cracked pot took notice of the sun warming the ebautiful wild flowers on the side of the path, and this cheered it some. But at the end of the trail, still felt bad because it had leaked out half its load, and so again it apologized to the bearer for its failure. The bearer said to the pot, ""Did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of the oath, but not on the other pot's side? That is because I have always known about your flaw, and took advantage of it. I planted flower seeds on your side of the path, and everyday while we walk back from the stream, you've watered them. For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my master's table. Without you being just the way you are, he would not have this beauty to grace his house."" Each of us has our own unique flaws. We're all cracked pots. But it's only our cracks and flaws that make our lives together so very intersting and rewarding. Don't ever feel that being a little cracked makes you less special or less loved. Yes everyone has flaws, just cuz I can't point out any of yous doesn't mean anything, but I kow that sometimes you think about your flaws more than you should, and you end up dwelling on them at times ... or at least did. I love you all so very much and you all should know that I would do anything to make you guys happy, all of you know that if you feel as though your flaws are getting the best of you, I am always only a call away, I am always available to you.

That is all ... so until next time ... Later Dayz!"

<CENTER>
<marquee scrolldelay=""250"" height=""40"" direction=""up"">Lyrics of the Day</marquee>

There are things that used to make me smile
One of them was you for just a little while
You left me for dead so far away
I replaced you with fear and shame
You'll be happy on the day I die

There are things that used to make me laugh
But now they're deeply buried in the past
I left them there so far away
Replaced my humor with my pain
I'll be happy on the day it dies

Remember when I said I love you
Well, forget it I take it back
I was just a stupid kid back then
I take back every word that I said

There are things that used to make you cry
One of them was me for just a little while
Why is it that you had to say
Goodbye in your special way
You slashed the tires on my car

Remember when I said I love you
Well, forget it I take it back
I was just a stupid kid back then
I take back every word that I said

Remember when I said I love you
Well, go ahead I take it back
I was just a stupid kid back then
I take back every word that I said

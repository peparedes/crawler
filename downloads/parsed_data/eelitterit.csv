"event","i suppose i've been neglecting you, journal. my deepest apologizes. school is boring, and i don't like it. the enviornment just sucks. the one good part is the library, i've decided to start avidly reading again. i'm almost done with go ask alice, which is wonderful so far. school is also good for meeting new people and connecting with old friends. i love courtney and kelley, and i'm excited to get closer with them. i've missed april, i remember why i used to love her company so much. she's very refreshing.

friday night i went to a local show featuring the devil wears prada with courntey and kelley and kristen and some of kristen's friends. nic's band also played there, and they were surprisingly exellent. the show would have been better had moshing been allow.

saturday was the eve of destruction with laurel, don and my brother. never in my life did i feel that wonderfully white trash. it was exciting, and people watching was really interesting. after that, my brother and i went over to kelley's for a bonfire with courtney and jon, too. that was also very amusing.

today after work, laurel, don and my brother picked me up and we went to x-trava con, which is some wierdo comic book convention. lots of creepy nerds, one extremely good looking young man.

i'm not ready for school tomorrow.
i'm getting sick.
a lot of people suck right now.

this weather's got me wanting love more tangible."

schools going okay thus far, my classes seem to be okay. i'm really excited for art, i want to start creating again. i lost inspiration for a while. sociology seems like it's going to be cool, as with government, street law and journalism. geometry, however, i am having my doubts. but that's just because math is satanic.

school is making me exhausted already. i'm not ready for waking up early, long days, homework. and on top of that i have to actually put forth some effort. meaning studying, no more sleeping, no more carelessness, no more putting shit off.

<lj-cut text=""i can stand my own ground."">
<b>1. What is more difficult for you, looking into someones eyes when you are telling someone how you feel, or looking into someones eyes when they are telling you how they feel?</b> Looking into someone's eyes when they are telling me how they feel. I always look into people's eyes when i talk to them. 

<b>2. Think of the last time you were REALLY angry. WHY were you angry? Do you still feel the same way?</b> When I felt like he was fucking with my head. I don't think he was trying, but I freaked. I think I over reacted, but now I'm still confused, and somewhat hurt.

<b>3. You are on a flight from Honolulu to Chicago non-stop. There is a fire in the back of the plane. You have enough time to make ONE phone call. Who do you call? What do you tell them?</b> Considering I would be with my family, I would call a random number and hope someone answers. I would want to tell them about my life, and let them know that they should live each day completely and free of fear.

<b>4. You are at the doctor's office and he has just informed you that you have approximately one month to live. Do you tell anyone/everyone you are going to die? What do you do with your remaining days? Would you be afraid?</b> I'm not sure if I would tell people or not. It's a toss up with me. My remaining days would be spend doing the same shit I do now; having fun. I wouldn't care about school, or about what other people thought. I would do a lot of shit that I always wanted to, too. And I wouldn't be afraid to die, because, well, I'm just not. In my opinion, the afterlife is when we all truely start to live, because it is eternal.

<b>5. You can have one of the following two things: trust/love. Which do you choose? Why?</b> Considering I don't believe in love, I'll say trust. Not to mention my considerable trust issue I have now, having complete trust would better me.

<b>6. You are walking down the street on your way to work. There is a dog drowning in the canal on the side of the street. Your boss has told you if you are late even once more, you are fired. Do you take the time to save the dogs life? Why or Why not?</b> Absolutely. Life is too precious to sacrifice. Plus, you never know who that dog really is. AND the karma prosperities would be enourmous.

<b>7. You are unfaithful to your spouse/significant other. Do you tell him/her? Why or Why not?</b> I wouldn't do it to begin with. But if for some reason I was, I would tell them, just because I'm a really honest person.

<b>8. Your best friend confesses that he/she has feelings for you more then just friendship. He/she is falling in love with you. What do you ( or did you ) do/say?</b> No matter who it was, I would be flattered that my friend thought so highly of me. I may date them, I may not.

<b>9. Think of the last person who you know that died. You have the chance to give them 1 hour of life back, but you have to give up one year of yours. Do you do it? Why or Why not?</b> I would. I didn't even know Lauren Laplante that well, but she had many friends that she never got the chance to say bye too. What's one hour of my life anyways?

<b>10. Are you the kind of friend that you would want to have as a friend?</b> I would either hate me, or really like me.

<b>11. Does love = sex?</b> Fuck love, have sex.

<b>12. Your boss tells your co-worker that they have to let them go because of work shortage, and they are the newest employee. You have been there much longer. Your co-worker has a family to support and no other means of income. Do you go to your boss and offer to leave the company? Why or Why not?</b> No. People learn through sufferage. The co-worker should be smart enough to find another job to support their family.

<b>13. When was the last time you told someone HONESTLY how you felt regardless of how difficult it was for you to say? Who was it? What did you have to tell the person?</b> I think the only thing closest to me ever doing that is when I tell Danielle stuff. And that is for her to know only :]

<b>14. What would be (or what was) harder for you to tell a friend, you love them or that you do not love them back?</b> That I don't love them back.

<b>15. What do you think would be the hardest thing for you to give up? Why would it be hard to lose?</b> Danielle and Ashee were very hard to loose. If I lost the rest of my friends or my family, I don't know what I'd do.

<b>16. Excluding romantic love, when was the last time you told someone you loved them? Who were they to you?</b> I told my mommy I love you last night. I always make it a point to tell her as much as I can.

<b>18. Imagine. It is a dark night, you are alone, it is raining outside, you hear someone walking around outside your window. WHO do you wish was there with you?</b> Danielle, or my brother.

<b>19. Would you give a homeless person CPR if they were dying?</b> Absolutely. Like I said, life is precious, and you never know who that homeless person reeeally is.

<b>21. You are holding onto your grandmothers hand and the hand of a newborn that you do not know as they hang over the edge of a cliff. You have to let one go to save the other. Who do you let fall to their death? What was your rationale for making the decision?</b> I'd save my gradmother. I'm closer with her, and why bring a newborn child into such a shitty world?

<b>22. Are you old fashioned?</b> Sometimes.

<b>23. When was the last time you were nice to someone and did NOT expect anything in return for it?</b> I do that all of the time.

<b>24. Which would you choose, true love with a guarantee of a broken heart, or never loved at all? Why?</b> Never love at all.

<b>25. If you could do anything or wish anything, what would it be?</b> That the people of the world would be united in brotherhood. We wouldn't have war, poverty, religion, law, money. The world would be a peaceful place to be and I wouldn't be hesitant about bring children into it.

<lj-cut text=""annabell lee by edgar allen poe."">
It was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me.

I was a child and she was a child,
In this kingdom by the sea;
But we loved with a love that was more than love-
I and my Annabel Lee;
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me.
And this was the reason that, long ago,
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsman came
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulcher
In this kingdom by the sea.
The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
Went envying her and me 
Yes! that was the reason,
as all men know, In this kingdom by the sea,
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we 
Of many far wiser than we 
And neither the angels in heaven above,
Nor the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.
For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
In the sepulcher there by the sea,
In her tomb by the sounding sea.

jordan came over today, and it was very nice to see him, considering i hadn't all summer. i miss him. we hung out with don and laurel as well. i also went to johnson's today for the first time in a trillion years. it was incredible. it looked a bit different, but i felt so happy and safe being there. it made me want to tag the shit out of it, too. i gotta get some spraypaint.

i like the book Mitchell is Moving. it's a childrens book about a dinosaur named mitchell who decides to move two weeks away, and his friend/neighboor margo doesn't want him to, and tries to stop him. dispite it being one of those learn-to-read books, i completely relate;

<i>'So long, everything' he shouted, 
then he ran next door to Margot's house. 

'I'm moving' he said. 

'Where' asked Margot. 

'Two weeks away' said Mitchell.

'Where is that' asked Margot.

'It's everywhere I will be after 
I walk for two weeks' said Mitchell. 
'I have lived in the same place for a 
long time. It is time for me to go some
 place else.'

'No' said Margot, 'you have only lived
 next door for fifteen years.'

'Sixteen' said Mitchell.

'Fifteen, six, what's the difference' 
said Margot. 'I want you to stay next 
door forever.'

'I can't' said Mitchell. 'I do not want to
go wake up in the same old bedroom and
eat breakfast in the same old kitchen. 
Every room in my house is the some old
room because I have been there too long.'</i>


i want to move two weeks away."

Because if you don't like it, you can stop fucking reading.</i>

Friday night, Don, Laurel, Ashee and Leigh came over. Had some fun, that's for certain. Ryan and Jon were supposed to come over, but didn't. After talking to Jon, it's because Ryan ditched us for some girl he likes. Am I surprised? Not in the least. Pissed? You betcha.

Yesterday was hanging out with Don and Laurel again. Been seeing a lot of them, by the way. It's nice, and reminds me of the old days.

Today, I worked. That's it. Mom and Greg are coming home soon. I wish they were gone longer, I'm liking this home alone thing. Not that they're usually home or anything, I just enjoy the feeling of independance and knowing that they're miles and miles away. They're going out of town next weekend again, and hopefully everything planned will go just as.

I miss Danielle.

so you made me come
then you sent me away
like a messenger bird
so I circled the earth
blown away in the wind
but I always returned
with some new little song
some sad story to tell
of a breif love affair
with a boy I compared to you and he failed
you said you dont want me to beg
then you said get down on your knees
cuz you knew that I would
if I do any good satisfying your needs.

and I know all about those things we cannot speak
and just so you know well they dont bother me
so you dont have to be worried
just nod your head if the plans have changed
shake it, love, if they stayed the same
smile at me and I will stay
start to cry and I'll go away
just please dont keep me waiting

just nod your head if your mind's been changed
shake it, love, if some hope remains

"event","According to Japanese legend if a koi succeeded in climbing the falls at a point called Dragon Gate on the Yellow River, it would be transformed into a dragon. Based on that legend, it became a symbol of worldly aspiration and advancement. 

The Japanese associate koi with perserverance in adversity and strength of purpose. Because of its strength and determination to overcome obstacles, it stands for courage and the ability to attain high goals. It means good fortune or luck, as well.

The Koi Fish is also symbolic in the Buddhist Religion, representing courage. Humans 'swim' through the 'ocean of suffering' without fear, just like a fish swims through water. 

The Koi is symbolic with family. On Childrens Day Koi flags are raised, Black Koi the father, Orange/Red mother, Blue/White for a boy, red/pink for a girl. 



With all this said,
I want a koi tattoo."

"event","We sent out the SOS call
It was a quater past four 
In the morning
When the storm broke our second anchor line.
Four months at sea.
Four months of calm seas
Only to be pounded in the shallows
Off of the tip of Montauk Point.

They call them rogues.
They travel fast and alone,
One hundred foot faces
Of God's good ocean gone wrong
What they call love is a risk,
Cause you will always get hit
Out of nowhere 
By some wave and end up on your own.

The hole in the hull defied the crews attempts 
To bail us out.
And flooded the engines and radio
And half buried bow.

Your tongue is a rudder.
It steers the whole ship.
Sends your words past your lips
Or keeps them safe behind your teeth.
But the wrong words will strand you.
Come off course while you sleep.
Sweep your boat out to sea
Or dashed it to bits on the reef.

The vessel groans
The ocean pressures its frame.
Off the port I see the lighthouse
Through the sleet and the rain.
And I wish for one more day 
To give my love and repay debts.
But the morning finds our bodies
Washed up thirty miles west.

They say that the captain 
Stays fast with the ship 
Through still and storm.
But this ain't the Dakota.
And the water is cold.
We won't have to fight for long.

This is the end.
This story's old
But it goes on and on 
Until we disappear.
Calm me and let me taste
The salt that you breathed
While you were underneath.
I am the one who haunts your dreams
Of mountains sunk below the sea.
I spoke the words but never
Gave a thought to what they all could mean.
I know that this is what you want.
A funeral keeps both of us apart.
You know that you are not alone.
Need you like water in my lungs.
This is the end."

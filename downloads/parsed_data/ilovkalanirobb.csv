"event","life is very bissfully fucked up and confusing... i have hardly any friends in school anymore but its better than hanging out with people who don't like me.i still have friends outside of school and some in school. but next year will be better. the funny thing is you can't really get our of the visous cycle of a click, like i think when you all together like that no one thinks for them selves soo we chose some one to hate every month or so. its o soo confusing. i'll always remeber the fun times unless i get hit on the head really hard. you know right now listening to joe strummer helps me just except everything. i really don't wish the situation was any different, whatever was felt had to come to light eventuly. i just feel stupid for hanging out with people who never liked me in the frist place. but lifes a bitch and it takes you on stupid rides..."

"event","so i love indie flims and and all the sudden i was like ""i should go to sundance"", so i check and it all ready happend. then i had to clean so i blasted kroq while i cleaned and downloaded some songs. school is sooo fucking retarded, i learn more when i dont go. skating and surfing are what i need to be doing not fucking geometry. which i am sooo bad at. i don't know what to do with the whole selena thing. but im not complaining because life is beautiful. when i go to a different school next year i wonder how its going to be, i need to hang out with people who don't annoy me. oh yah i decided to dress up while i clean i have a black leotard on with my gold heart belt, gold fishnets,pink leg warmers, and tap shoes. pretty awsome, huh! the whole day today i hung out with guys cause my friends were doing shit, i miss my old guy friends. we hated eachother but yet looking back on it we were friends. i don't know what school they go too anymore, but thats the way life goes. i have lost a lot of friends over the years i hope i don't lose the ones i have now. it would of been cool to go to sundance, exspecially if stacy had a flim out.

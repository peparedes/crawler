<P>i've become one of those people...but i am insanely happy, so can it be that bad?</P>
<P>i've officially decided that i am not going back to school, and my plan is to get certified in massage therapy like i've been thinking about doing for about a year now.</P>
<P>i haven't talked to my father in close to three weeks now, and i'm not sure why. it all started with my avoiding his phone calls because he kept pushing me to get my financial aid figured out for the summer, and i just didn't have the time [and didn't want to either, so i didn't make the time]. but now it has become more of a need to separate myself from him, and i'm not sure why. it upsets me that i haven't talked to him, and i know he's just waiting for me to call him, but somehow i can't bring myself to. i can't bring myself to tell him that i am not going back to school. my mother knows, and seems ok with the idea, but it's proving to be harder for me to tell him. i think i'm going to call him today.</P>
<P>i told jared that there's not much stopping me from heading out west with my dog, and getting certified in a state i actually want to live in. i feel like i'm going crazy; all of this shit is possible, and all of it is happening. we sleep next to each other every night. we go on evening road trips every other night it seems, just driving west and talking, or not talking. we have the kind of relationship where we don't even have to touch each other, but still thoroughly enjoy one anothers company. it's not easy to find someone with whom you have physical attraction as well as an intellectual connection, but somehow i did, and nothing has ever felt quite this right before.</P>
<P>this is the first time in months that i haven't felt the need for my medication to get me through my days, yet i'm still taking it [mostly because i'm afraid of what will happen if i stop]. i used to crave those three little blue pills every morning, but now taking them slips my mind, and i usually remember sometime during the afternoon.</P>
<P>billie is doing well, she is currently asleep on my bed.&nbsp;she slept in the bed with us last night, right in the middle, like a little baby. she's HUGE now, at least three times the size she was when i first brought her home, but her face is still as beautiful and sweet as it was at 2 1/2 months of age. i definitely love her more than life, and don't regret getting her in the least [as some told me i would].</P>
<P>well, there you have it, a full update on my life.</P>

..i've already been partially released. this week has been hell. finally finished up all of my papers yesterday. most of my week went as follows: wake up, write, go to class, come back, write, maybe eat, write, go to bed, wake up, write. it went on like that for several days there. i finally got to eat a meal today; i think my stomach is going to explode, as it most likely shrunk quite a bit in those few days during which WordPerfect consumed every second of every hour that i wasn't in class.

the WRC benefit concert went pretty okay last night. the Um's were fantastic as usual. i think we raised at least a couple hundred dollars to put towards joining. afterwards we went to the hubcap house and just chilled on their front porch while they took turns playing guitar and singing songs at random. i had a really good conversation with Stevie G [as they call him]. we talked for a good long while about the pixies and how frank black is a crazy bastard.

i went over to rachel and katie's after class today. we sat on their porch and drank cosmopolitans in the afternoon sun. katie played the banjo for me while i was quasi-napping in their big, red bowl-chair. i enjoy those two immensely.

tonight there's a toga party at the mansion. i enjoy going to the mansion. it kind of reminds me of the Beers' house that i spent much of my childhood in, only bigger. big windows, big arched entrances to rooms, wooden floors, large staircase; it has a lot of character. alan and tony are lucky they got to move in there. i want to explore it tonight in my drunken, toga-glory.

Last night I came home, and the first thing my roommate said to me was ""ummm, whenever you get a chance, I need your half of the cable bill for the last three months."" Keep in mind, this is money&nbsp;for cable to a television that I DON'T EVEN WATCH. I feel like going to the bank, withdrawing every cent of the money I have left, hopping on a bike, riding down the middle of Apalachee Parkway and letting it all fly away in the wind while screaming, ""THERE YOU GO, LICK IT UP OFF THE GROUND MOTHERFUCKERS!"" and then riding far, far away. Hmm...</P>
<P>That aside, I'm looking forward to summer break. Seeing as I can't afford to stay here for the summer anymore, I will be living with my mother and working at home. I'm starting to like the idea going home. I need to get away from this city--its people, its air, its everything. I need a break from the cliches, the people that try so hard to fulfill social roles, the cynicism, the drama, the relationships, the drug-induced apathy, the deadlines, the exams, etcetera. Most of all, I just need time.</P>
<P>Okay...I was supposed to start this paper an hour ago. I'm really horrible at this. I have two papers due wednesday, and one due thursday. My plan goes as follows: paper 1, tonight. paper 2 tomorrow night. paper 3 wednesday night. we'll see how this goes...</P>

I blacked out at the press conference today, for which I was nothing more than a warm body. ""Earned press."" So I stood, looked at the camera, looked at my toe covered in blood, looked all around me at the well-dressed men and women, looked at them looking at me, dirty, blood-drained face, unruly hair, and stumbled to a chair before I lost my vision and blacked out completely. What a horrible feeling. Reminded me of church. Sit, stand, kneel. Sit, stand, kneel. SIT, STAND, KNEEL. I always felt faint. Maybe my body was trying to tell me something.

The question ""Did I teach you how to love?"" has been running through my head. And the sad thing is, I can't come up with an answer. Yes. no. maybe. Yes, because I love you, but no...no because it's incredibly difficult for me to love. Watching the two of you, I learned how to be independent. I learned how not to depend on physical affection or any kind of attention for validation. I learned that words are like fire, and that actions don't always speak louder than words. I learned that my role as a woman is not to live to please a man, or anybody for that matter, but to live for myself and myself alone. I learned strength and selfishness, weakness and selflessness. Rationality and irrationality. I learned that I should never give up any part of myself to something that isn't what I want or need. You supplied me with wisdom and knowledge beyond that of what parents normally deliver to their children. And for all of that I am eternally thankful, but the question remains, does love play into any of that? ...and it remains unanswered.

I thought I had already passed this part in my life, the part where I began to see my parents as 'real' people, people with lives beyond that of giving life to me. I guess I didn't quite get there when I thought I had.

This week has been filled with painful discoveries, as well as comforting ones; discoveries that have helped me make sense of things that I have been trying to make sense of for years.

I have been walking around for the last four hours in a perpetual state of shock. It's all so strange and foreign to me. It's going to take me a few weeks to absorb all of this information and make sense of it.

In other news, my father and Nat left for the Great Lakes state this morning. It was a difficult goodbye. I'm not entirely sure what is going to happen in the next few months. I've grown tired of everything being so unsettled. I have too much going through my head right now, I probably shouldn't even be writing, let alone publicizing any of it. I need to clear my head. Writing only makes me over-analyze everything more than I already do. And i'm done.

"event","So, last night I had at least three consecutive dreams about being held hostage.

hmm.

In other news, I have gotten through the worst of this week, and only have one more midterm and then a paper to write. I feel much better than I did a few days ago [my apologies to my lovely friends who had to put up with me through those few days]. I am leaving for home on Friday, which makes me happy. The only bad thing is that I am getting sick again [third time this semester! something has happened to me!] so there's a possibility that I will be bed-ridden for the week, but at least I will be at home where my mom can fill me with weird herbal supplements and echinachia tablets.

I'm thinking about changing my major to...philosophy [i know, i know] with a minor in studio art, if that's even possible. Because yeah, somewhere along the line, I lost my passion for biology. I will miss those science experiments dearly.

I'm incredibly frightened; frightened that the revelation that I had a few nights ago is of a true nature. I am afraid that no one will ever be enough for me...and that I will never be enough for someone else. But then I ask myself, why do I worry so much about such things? I know it all comes down to the fact that society has conditioned me to think that love and/or relationships are necessary components to happiness in life [especially in adulthood], and that I will be an unhappy, bitter outcast in life without either of them. But I'm starting to come to realization that love is not real, it is nothing but creation, another control tactic created by man, and that relationships are nothing but a series of compromises through which you lose your sense of self and sense of independence. Well, fuck that. I refuse to compromise any part of myself. I refuse to surrender myself to something so fake. I refuse to cripple myself. And I refuse to become dependant on anything other than myself.

"event","So the last few days have been pretty difficult for me to get through. I just feel as if I have been running around everywhere, never slowing down to enjoy life. There have been so many moments when I have just wanted to throw myself face down into the grass on landis and let the earth consume me. I take the same paths back to my building every day, the same paths to everywhere; it's all growing so old. But that's just me, I'm never content with my life as it is. I always want something more; new people, new environments, new experiences...new paths. I can't handle this monotonous lifestyle. I'm starting to wonder if I will ever be content, if I will ever be able to stay in a long-term relationship, or anything long-term for that matter. I'm not sure if it's possible for me; I don't think I will be satisfied. It's my perpetual desire for variety in life, I guess. I envision myself always moving, always traveling, always...going away. It scares me to think that I will never be able to stay put...

In other news, [as seen below] Sarah and I FINALLY signed the lease today. I'm incredibly excited. I have a house. It still hasn't quite hit me yet... I plan on moving in in June [there are a few rooms open during the summer if anyone is interested]. After we signed the lease, our landlord got really excited and started telling us about all the flowers he had planted the day before; He's such an endearing old man.

And oh yeah, I almost forgot how fun ear infections are...

"event","Tonight was the first night in awhile that I've just had a genuinely good time. I went with Mike and Sarah to the Warehouse for jazz night. We met up with Roberto, and ended up running into Alex and Jen as well. The jazz musicians were pretty good. I got Guinness, which I enjoyed more than anything; it was the first good beer that I have had in awhile. I love how drinking one Guinness is like drinking two beers. We sat and absorbed the lively atmosphere for awhile, tapping our feet and fingers uncontrollably. I ran into a guy from my Philosophy of Feminism class and had a good conversation. Turns out he's from Sarasota and has gone to the same drum circle as I have many a time. Small world. It was nice to be in good company, drinking good beer and dancing to good music. I intend on going more often.

For the past week I have worked out every day. I have a desire to be fit and healthy again. It feels good to release endorphins and such; I think I shall keep it up. The only thing I dislike about is the other people I'm forced to be surrounded with. I think I need not elaborate anymore.

In other news, I ingested meat for the first time in a long, long time today. Of course it was by mistake. I went to the diner earlier this evening, saw that tomato soup was their soup of the day, and ordered it. I took several spoonfuls before I realized that the little pieces in it weren't cheese, but pieces of shredded meat. I spit it all out into my napkin, felt extremely sick and went to the bathroom. Of course due to the fact that I HAVE NO GAG REFLEX, I couldn't purge it out of my system. Who the fuck puts meat in tomato soup?! I was quite angry and horrified. Still am, actually.

And I'm done.

<P>And with that, I am out.</P>
<P>--peace.</P>"

That aside, things have been strange lately. I'm happy, but I'm just in a strange place in my life. I don't know what else to say at the moment, at least anything that I wish to disclose.

Maybe it's a ridiculous notion, a fanciful impulse, but there's a possibility it's not.

<P><BR>So I have a house to live in next year. Five bedrooms, hardwood floors, front porch, beautiful old windows, basement and a backyard. It's perfect. The room I'm hoping to get also has a built-in bookshelf. I will be living with Sarah, Josh and Becca [who I don't know that well, but seems really nice]. We decided to keep the basement open for guests instead of having a fifth roommate. Our house will be big enough for after-parties, big enough to have space from people when I need it, and a beautiful front porch to smoke and drink tea on in the morning. I can't wait for next year. I plan on going home for a month, and then moving back in June. It will be great. Our landlord looks like the nice, old man in Home Alone [the one who he thinks is scary, but actually isn't].</P>
<P><BR>I had a good night last night. I went over for a dinner party at tony and alan's. The food was amazing as usual. There was a minor kitchen fire, and none of us knew what to do, as the fire was inside the oven, but somehow the flaming oven mit was brought out onto the linoleum floor and stomped out. A tequila night ensued soon after dinner, but I ended up not participating much past one shot. Instead I opted for continuous bong hits with alan and lindsey. I passed out on the couch and woke up to all of my friends dancing wildly in candlelight. All I could make out were their silhouettes against yellow light. I wish I could have joined, but I couldn't bring my limbs to move, so I just watched through a haze of smoke and scattered light, and soon after dragged myself to a nook in tony's bed and buried myself amongst blankets. It was oh so cold last night, but I felt warm the entire time. I love my friends.</P>

And that is all I can bring myself to say at the moment.

I have to get up in a few hours and go house-hunting for next year."

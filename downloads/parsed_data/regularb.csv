December 3: N offers a jump. Both doors frozen shut. Key is in danger of snapping off. We cannot get under the hood.
December 4: Self-charger exchanged, after long, cold walk. Door de-icer purchased.
December 8: Successful jump-start from N. Engine runs for a good 30 minutes. 
December 9: Battery dead. Self-charger dead. N, with admirable generosity, offers another jump-start. Car starts. I climb in and prepare to drive for a long time. Rearview mirror comes off in my hand. I leave the engine running and go get some Superglue. I sit in the car, engine still running, and attempt several times to reattach the mirror.

This is by far the latest I've ever finished, but the sheer fact that I finished? Awesome.

N has an interesting hypothesis, involving the interrelation of creation and destruction, that I create so much my creative genius (as in the motivating spirit, not the ability) has to cause a lot of attendant destruction. As fuel. As balance. As something. In any case, the past couple of days offer plenty of support for this belief:

- the car doors, one of which sprang open (surprise!) as I was driving to work yesterday, one of which wouldn't even let the key turn in the lock as I was trying to get home from work today
- the 10,000 other drivers who tried their hardest to hit me on those commutes
- last night's flat-out snide rejection slip for a short story (but I wound up working it, and the reply I wanted to send, into the NaNothing, so it's all good)
- the bottle of cranberry juice, whose cap I should have checked before I shook it
- the big dish of maple-tangerine glaze, which I poured all down the front of my good winter coat (also en route to work this morning)
- the mural in the bathroom, which fell off the wall this morning (it was a rough morning all around)
- the broken glass on the kitchen shelf, which I discovered right after N and I had a conversation about Periods of Broken Things

I feel as though I'm forgetting something. Ah well. As N says, it's not massive crippling destruction. It sort of dances between annoying and funny. I choose funny. Maybe it's just what happens when you start taking risks. I don't know. In any case I've got this manuscript now. And all kinds of challenging, bruising circus skills to practice. And a few unexpected pieces of work that point unequivocally towards Italy. Accompanying all these Broken Things are a lot of really odd coincidences that whisper: One way or another, you are living rightly."

I suppose it's conceivable that all these stories will somehow wind up being connected (Dad suggests a framing device involving someone with multiple-personality disorder), so it turns out to be a loosely episodic piece of long fiction and thus conforms to strict NaNoWriMo protocol after all.

Imagine, then, my surprise, on arriving home just now, to discover the Pop Tarts and chocolate chips strewn about the pantry floor, another bag shredded, a jar tipped.

Here's where it gets bad. It's not a mouse.

A large hole has been gnawed or clawed into the kitchen window screen (less than a year old: the landlord will be happy about that). I'm on the second floor.

It's an effing SQUIRREL.

If the squirrel is still in the kitchen, it's dead, because god knows those suckers can't keep quiet when they panic, and I've been clomping around and swearing enough that it would have panicked. 

Pros: Squirrels are marginally smarter than mice. This one apparently knew how to get out of the kitchen, whereas the mice always seemed to get sort of confused about that. If the pillaged shelf is any indication, bowel control is not as much of an issue for squirrels as it is for mice.

Cons: Way the hell larger. They can climb anywhere. The claws can obviously do some serious damage. I don't think you can buy an indoor squirrel trap, and I don't even want to consider how I'd handle emptying such a thing. Squirrels are cute enough to make you feel guilty for wishing them dead, too.

Sarah suggested that I sprinkle capsaicin around the window. But the cayenne doesn't seem to be doing much in the garden. (Maybe I should upgrade to pepper spray. Do you think that would work?)

Coyote urine. Okay. It makes sense that this would work, but I have several questions. Where does one obtain coyote urine? Do you have to find the dealer standing beneath a pair of cowboy boots slung over a power line? Is there an enterpreneur out there who, even now, is scheming to become chief coyote urine supplier to the whole Midwest? Is it safe to assume my neighbors would react poorly if I started pouring coyote urine out of the second-floor window? Is it possible that, in combination with the pepper spray, it would just make our clean, woodsy little alley smell like every other alley in Chicago?"

<b>Utah film sanitizers ordered to cut it</b>
Court ruling: Deleting objectionable language, sex and violence injures artistic expression
By Vince Horiuchi 
The Salt Lake Tribune 
 
It's the kind of ending Hollywood craves. 

   After a bitter three-year legal battle involving Utah companies that sanitize movies on DVD and VHS tape, a federal judge in Denver ruled Thursday that such editing violates U.S. copyright laws and must be stopped. 

   In a ruling in the case involving CleanFlicks vs. 16 of Hollywood's hottest directors, U.S. District Judge Richard P. Matsch found that making copies of movies to delete objectionable language, sex and violence hurts studios and directors who own the movie rights. 

   ""Their [studios and directors] objective . . . is to stop the infringement because of its irreparable injury to the creative artistic expression in the copyrighted movies,"" the judge wrote in a 16-page decision. ""There is a public interest in providing such protection. Their business is illegitimate."" 

   Michael Apted, director of ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and president of the Director's Guild of America, said Friday that movie directors can feel ""vindicated"" by the ruling. 

   ""Audiences can now be assured that the films they buy or rent are the vision of the filmmakers who made them and not the arbitrary choices of a third-party editor,"" he said in a statement to The Salt Lake Tribune. 

   Ray Lines, chief executive of CleanFlicks in American Fork, said he plans to meet with his attorneys Monday to discuss the ruling, but vowed to keep fighting Hollywood. 

   ""We're disappointed,"" he said. ""This is a typical case of David vs. Goliath, but in this case, Hollywood rewrote the ending. We're going to continue to fight."" 

   CleanFlicks is a distributor that produces copies of Hollywood blockbusters on DVD by burning a scrubbed version onto a blank disc. Those versions are then sold over the Internet and to video stores around the country who offer them for rent. 

   . . . The controversy over cleansing movies began in 1998 when the owners of Sunrise Family Video in American Fork began deleting nude scenes of Kate Winslet from the blockbuster ""Titanic"" for $5. 

And it boils down to that. Kate Winslet's boobies. I mean, they're very pretty and all, but if that's what counts as hard-core here, then maybe it really is time for me to give up and move to, I don't know, France, where you can see that kind of thing on your average beach, and experiencing pleasure--above or below the neck--is not a sin against God and country.

I never thought grilled cheese was the eucharistic meal of choice, but sure, why not? I bet it's hell to clean around the features of Our Lord, though.

Christianity is the only religion that does this sort of thing, right? I mean, if I googled ""Vishnu pan""...well, now, let's see...

...ah, right, 193,000 sites and a reminder that Pan is also a deity. Use quotes, B.

""Vishnu skillet"": nada.
""Buddha pan"": a blog that reads ""Lay your hands on this perfect solution for countering baldness and kiss good-bye to your buddha-pan."" I'm scared to click on the link.
""Mohammed pan"": apart from the likely attention of countless federal agents, a site excerpt that reads, verbatim, ""Ash-shadu-un-laa- mohammed Pan chod-ar-rasoolullahh! Ash-shadu-un-laa- mohammed Pan chod-ar-rasoolullahh! Hayi-FUK -fallahhhhhhhh! Hayi-FUK -fallahhhhhhhh!"" 
Seriously, I cut and pasted that. I have not changed a letter. It's on the indiaculture.net forum, if you want to check.

But unless ""Ash-shadu-un-laa-mohammed Pan"" means ""Impress the face of the one true prophet upon your flatbreads,"" then I have to conclude that it's just us dorky westerners who need to emblazon our holy logos upon everything we touch. Imagine what we could do if, every time we felt compelled to buy a Jesus Pan, we oh, say, maybe, <i>gave that money to the poor.</i>

And behold, there was kitsch. And it was good.

Oh, crap, and now it's 9:50. And I haven't edited a damn thing. Crap, crap. I blame the Jesus Pan."

Readings tonight. Three new plays, or pieces of them. Actors with scripts in hand, lights up and lights down on a smallish stage--one of the more respected stages in Chicago--and an audience of perhaps 60 hearing lines that no audience has ever heard before. So that's theater right there, the very heart of it, the kind of thing that makes <i>Time</i> and the <i>Guardian</i> and whoever else call this city the current theater capital of the world. And I was right in the middle of it, among my people. I knew one of the playwrights--I mean, because it was Terry--as well as the artistic director of the respected smallish stage (though, admittedly, I gave him a really crap audition last month and he kind of looked through me tonight); I heard the new plays and listened and laughed and thought about what they implied for what I'm writing and how I will perform the next time I'm onstage (if I can stop having crappy auditions long enough to ever get another role) and what I think about the medium in general.

So why the bloody hell doesn't it feel like enough?

I don't mean I have a little touch of Martha Graham's divine unrest. I mean this is not remotely close to enough. I mean every stage in this city, respected and otherwise, feels too goddamn small.

Anyway, it yielded one of the strangest collections of images I've seen in a while. Kreon is apparently the name of a German manufacturer (of industrial components and pills?) and for some reason the word also calls up a bunch of images of Soviet-era robotics, as well as some abstract modern art (I'm guessing ""Kreon"" is ""crayon"" somewhere in Eastern Europe). Add to that two fine-blooded racehorses, some ancient masks, and the expected smattering of young-looking actors in low-rent productions (including one smirking guy in a 1950s suit and what looks like a Burger King crown), and you have a nice healthy dose of modern absurdity, or else fodder for a suspense potboiler.

                      'Playing The Clash made me a terror suspect'

by ANNE CAMPBELL, Metro 08:06am 5th April 2006

A mobile phone salesman was hauled off a plane and questioned for three hours as a
terror suspect - because he listened to songs by The Clash and Led Zeppelin. Harraj
Mann, 24, played the punk anthem London Calling and classic rock track Immigrant
Song in a taxi before a flight to London.

The lyrics to both tracks made the driver fear his passenger was a terrorist.

THE WORDS OF THE CLASH TRACK BEGIN: ""LONDON CALLING TO THE FARAWAY TOWNS, NOW WAR IS
DECLARED AND BATTLE COME DOWN."" AND LED ZEP'S IMMIGRANT SONG GOES: ""THE HAMMER OF
THE GODS WILL DRIVE OUR SHIPS TO NEW LANDS, TO FIGHT THE HORDE, SINGING AND CRYING:
VALHALLA, I AM COMING!"" [capital letters theirs]

Mr Mann, of Hartlepool, Teesside, had boarded the plane at Durham Tees Valley
Airport when the flight to Heathrow was stopped and he was arrested by police. He
said he was told he was being questioned under the Terrorism Act and his choice of
music had aroused suspicions. Mr Mann said yesterday: 'The taxi had one of those
tape deck things that plugs into your digital music player.

""I played Procol Harum's Whiter Shade Of Pale first, which the taxi man liked. I
figured he liked the classics so put on a bit of Led Zeppelin - Immigrant Song -
which he didn't like. Then, since I was going to London, I played the song by The
Clash and finished up with Nowhere Man by The Beatles.""

Mr Mann said he was 'frog-marched off the plane in front of everyone, had my bags
searched and was asked 'every question you can think of'. He added: ""It turned out
the taxi driver alerted someone when I arrived at the airport and had spoken about
my music. He didn't like Led Zep or The Clash but there was no need to tell the
police.""

Durham Police said the action was taken 'as a result of information received' and
the flight was stopped before take-off.
###

Holy CRAP. I guess I'm not moving to London, then. I'd love to think this was a joke but unfortunately it probably isn't one. What ridiculous hoops we are all jumping through lately. In fact, there's actually a story I really want to write about a pair of schmos who try to blow up the Empire State building, but I'm kind of nervous about doing the necessary research. And that is just goddamn stupid. I'm a FICTION WRITER. In the UNITED STATES. I am supposed to be able to write whatever the hell I want.

Grr. At the risk of being hauled in for questioning, I'm going to make the only other appropriate comment I can think of, which is--naturally--a Joe Strummer lyric:

<i>You have the right to freeee speech
As long as you're not dumb enough
To actually try it.</i>"

"event","From today's NY Times:
Mr. Hare said that he felt American audiences would respond to the play, even if, he said, it was unlikely that a work like ""Stuff Happens"" could ever transfer to Broadway because of its large cast (16 actors). ""It's not politics, it's economics,"" he said, though he added that he felt American theater makers had not really stepped up to the challenge of the war. 

""Certainly from Los Angeles my impression is that the American audience is way ahead of the American theater establishment,"" Mr. Hare said, speaking of the 2005 production. ""For some reason in America the theater has also been largely collusive in offering escapist entertainment, as if we were living through the Depression or as if we were living through a war that we all agree on. Actually, we're fighting a war that we don't agree on. And I wish I saw more signs in the American theater of that dissent being dramatized.""


Go forth, my children, and make shows."

"event","Okay then. For the first time in nearly two years, I don't know what I'm doing next.

I still seem to be a writer. I've been writing prose again this week, revisiting <i>Bird by Bird</i>, feeling a couple of plots (both old and new) nudge me, even sending out a collection of stories. Got a really nice rejection slip on a batch of poems last week, too, the kind of thing that makes you think, hey, maybe there is an audience for these things. I think I might be done sending <i>Rook</i> out, though. Which is sad. It feels like a waste of a hell of a lot of work. But I'm not sure I care about it passionately enough to sell it any more. Some might, of course, say that's the perfect mental state to be in before you send your work out. But oh hell, it's tough.

I'm pretty damn sure I'm still an actor, too, if this crankiness and restlessness about auditions is any indication. God, I <i>must</i> be missing acting if the MFA is starting to seem appealing again. So I need to get the hell back on stage.

Definitely still a coffee drinker.

Being a playwright was never really the plan, until I got an idea and knew it had to be a play. Being a musician wasn't really the plan either, but--well, I am one. 

I'm still really interested in history, and classical languages, though I wonder if it's necessary to get a degree in them to do what I want to do. 

I'm 30.

February always makes me think about leaving this city, but I'm wondering increasingly if I can have the acting career I want here. There's New York, of course, but...hmm. Well. I can legally work in London. I don't know if I can have the acting career I want there, either, actually, but I like the British approach to acting a whole lot.

Deep down there's also, still, a very quiet and neglected shaggy-haired girl who loves to draw, and in drawing can achieve the kind of pure and complete inner peace one rarely finds elsewhere.

Well: and what the hell do I do with all this?

and what the hell kind of arrogance is it to expect that my life will actually conform with whatever plan I make for it?"

"event","From today's NY Times, on the Muhammed-satirizing cartoons: 

Last week a State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, simultaneously condemned the cartoons as ""unacceptable"" and spoke up for free speech, while the Joint Chiefs of Staff were firing off a letter to The Washington Post about a cartoon it ran in which Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, in the guise of a doctor, says to a heavily bandaged soldier who has lost his arms and legs, ""I'm listing your condition as 'battle hardened.' "" The letter called the cartoon, by Tom Toles, ""reprehensible"" and offensive to soldiers.

The Post's editorial page editor, Fred Hiatt, replied that the newspaper would not censor its cartoonists, inspiring John Aravosis, who runs Americablog (americablog.blogspot.com), the Web site where the letter was first reported, to tell Editor & Publisher magazine: ""Now that the Joint Chiefs have addressed the insidious threat cartoons pose to our troops, perhaps they can move on to the less pressing issues like getting them their damn body armor.""

HA! Yes, we can hope so. Please, remind me of this week the next time I'm complaining that no one notices art in today's world."

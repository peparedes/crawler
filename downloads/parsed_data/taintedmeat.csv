Aristotle: stable, committed relationships-but the upside is that the when the men are 37, their wives must be 18. Not to mention-since the wife is inferior, the man can tell her what to do. Are you a Platonist or an Aristotleian? Cast in your pebbles, I'll post the results."

"event","Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing with my life. I wake up each morning take a sip from my nalgene bottle, put on my converse all stars, black plastic glasses, rainbow socks, ripped black shorts, ironic t-shirt, black hoodie (with anarchy symbol on back), and eat a quick breakfast of Kashi with soy milk and walk out the door in hopes of scaring some suits. I mean, I know I'm a really really good person and all, but sometimes you just want a little more. I hate to admit it, but I really like this girl who wears clothes from the Gap. Now I know that she is a complete moron because she does not hold the same views as me, yet still I'm strangely attracted to her. Oh cruel world! I need to go to the bathroom..."

like Enron's papers in the wastebasket
You'll never see their faces 
shrouded by Burkhas
keep the pictures in your briefcases
maybe a glimpse on page 14 A
or maybe the day you're out of office
chewing on a hamburger
just another tasty murder
You know what I say?
Eat a Dick 
preferably Cheney, that fat ass heart-diseae ridden motherfucker
the real president playin' undercover

Chorus: To the man named Dubya, I say Fuck Ya
        Don't vote for him, my mothafucka

Anyway it's a work in progress... Let's fuck shit up!

       My goal in life is to fuck you up. For a long time I sucked on the teat of the earth. It made me strong. I enjoyed the teat. I worshiped it. Now I've come to a realization. My strength is illusory. All along the world has been sucking away at me. It took my life-blood, sucked the marrow, only to spit the waste on the ground causing it to grow mold. That pool of innocence has warped and mutated and what has ensued is a dark morbid moribund morose mangled mess of beauty. Beauty! Yes, they would call it beautiful. Wouldn't they? Well enough! Fuck the system! Don't call me beautiful. When you sweep away my bones don't spread them across the Ganges. You people are going straight for the incinerator.
              Love
                 Tyler"

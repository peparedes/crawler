"event","I'm loosing control again.. This time its not about drugs, its about me.  I had the most self-awakening summer. I learned that if people dont like u for u, FUCK EM!! lol But then I found Trevor.. For the first time, sum1 loved me as much as I loved them. He knew me, just as kim and terry and ali know me. Wow and now that I dont have that.. well I've kinda lost control."

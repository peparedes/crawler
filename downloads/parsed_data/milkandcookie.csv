You know what's crazy? In situations when things are great, there's still limitless stress. I was contemplating why I can't find myself in the good times anymore. Opportunities are finally being flung into my face (what I've been waiting for and what everyone has been talking about) and I'm still going bananas! So bananas, that I went home mid-finals week purely so I could lay on my parents' bed and tell them that I want them to drive me around and pull the meat off the bones/out of shells and bring me snacks when I'm in class. I went home to hear them tell me that they still would --- and that's what makes me strong enough to keep stressing. Can't stop loving the family and friends!
Anywho .. I was thinking again that maybe I'm all screwed up now and am anti-happy girl, not capable of just being. Depressing isn't it? BUT I realized that God made it THIS way because if I was deliriously happy right now, I'd fall on my face and really be up the butt. When you're at the top, there's no way but down. I can't afford to go down right now.

and hey.. CONGRATULATIONS to all the grads! Don't worry, opportunities will be flung in your face too. Just catch one at a time, school's in the bag!"

Daphne's Snow Ball
Daphne turned 16! It's really weird that she's getting older because she's always going to be my little sister. When I think about her, it makes me try to remember what I did when I was her age (a whOpping 3 years ago! hehe) and when I started to like boys and when I became 'pretty' and when I was finally real. Then I think, ""Oh man, I wonder if she's anything like me when I was her age!"" Would that be a good thing? It wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing; I'd just be shocked.
Her party was quite a success. It was all girls; I never had 20 girlfriends at a time. I guess I'm a guy person. Anyway, everyone looked really cute and I felt like a schlump!

No more studying for Pauline alalala! I think I'm delirious now.

"event","SO I'm a livejournal whore.. :p

I'm stuck in my room today; give me some credit from tearing myself away from my precious chemistry book! BUT boy do I feel like a loser posting for the 3rd time today!

harUmph: I have nothing to talk about. Let's see..
1) I'm going psycho from studying for 6 hours. Despite this fact, it has only felt like I've been studying for an hour! I like that.
2) O-chem is challenging! I like that too!
3) Now I'm bored, since I was expecting an all nighter and I'm not about to study calc (that would push out all my chemistry knowledge from my brain).
4) I want to dAnce!!
5) I'm going to a party tomorrow :X weird..

the end!

This may be mean, but the truth is hardly ever nice. 
People are stupid. Sometimes I wonder why because I believe that all people have a choice in life. Option A: Use your abilities to become everything that you want to be. Your brain is there; use it. or Option B: Be a giant lazy butt that complains about being stupid (about how it's not your fault, but think JUST for a second: it is). Get over it and pick your butt up!

I can't change the ignorant people because in the long run they're the most apt to not listen. I know I'm not ever going to be the smartest person in the world and maybe I'm not the best person for advice, but at least I don't think I'm stupid. I'm confident and I think that intimidates people. When I want something I'm logical: How will I get there? What's the best route? Is it worth it? Then I go. Hopefully, the people I love will keep up with me, otherwise I'll go first and come back to help."

"event","I ate and ate and ate today. Well...not so much, but I went to Fuji's Sushi Buffet :D (early birthday present to myself) I went with Matt my cOol Indonesian friend - we're math geniuses, or more like he's the genius and I'm the understudy. Anyhow, we ate as much as we could and then got a coffee and talked. I admit it was really refreshing getting out of the routine of life.
Now, while I should be studying, I'm learning that I'm not as computer literate as I thought. It's sad.

Evanescence is POSTPONED :( bOoOoooo! They're flakers - first BFD and now this!

BUT, I am super excited that Thanksgiving is coming up and I get to see my cousin from Boston and, of course, I get to eat cake without being condemned (birthday :])!"

I just got back to Davis from my two day excursion to the bay! What a trip huh? I loved being home. I forgot how wonderful it is to walk barefoot on clean carpet, have a fridge full of food, and see faces of people who truly absolutely undoubtedly love me!

Some days out of the blue I am reminded of how blessed I am. Today I looked at my life and saw beauty. I have everything I need and extras.
What I didn't see, until today, are the people who are envious of what I have.
There's always someone trying to bring you down >_<"

I feel bad because I make Daniel stay up with me because I know he knows that I know he coaxes me to sleep :] I'm like a weird human puppy.

Yes our puppy has diarrhea! haha. Poor guy."

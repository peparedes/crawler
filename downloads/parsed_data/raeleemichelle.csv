I like college.
The amount of homework sucks.
But that's ok.
Because I like East.
and dancing.
and the awesome gym.
and new friends.
and freedom.
Oh, and pretzels with PB on them.






That's all.




P.S.---I HAVE A SUPER COOL COSTUME PLANNED FOR HALLOWEEN......MAYBE I'LL TELL YOU IF YOU ASK ME. MAYBE."

"event","I haven't updated this, in quite a while, Because Bob Evans sucks, and made me work nearly every single day. But, that's alright, because I went on EDUCATIONAL LEAVE early. And, I just called Pizza Hut. The reason they didn't call me back was because she knew I moved, and thought it was the wrong number, but she's supposed to call me back later about orientation. Score, I think.





Ozzfest, was totally amazing. I have never had that much fun, ever.




Monday=Warped Tour=Awesome music + MAD fun with Knepptard



I just rented Jacket. It looks good.



I need to do the work for that IT class. I really don't feel like it.


I keep forgetting to call Tony for Amanda.

"event","Hmmmmm, was it for the best, or the worst? I don't really know right now. I don't know anything. I don't know what I want, and I'm sick of trying to figure it out. I think I just want  to have fun for the rest of the summer, and not be strapped down. Is that a bad thing? I don't think it is, considering I'm going to have to go to college, and study 24/7.....and.....I won't have time for a relationship anyways.





I'm leaning towards the best.



Hopefully, I didn't just offend you. I'm not trying to.

Yes, Knepptard, I know you think the guitar class is retarded,like you, but it will count as a fine arts credit.


I REALLY do not want to be pre-med. I'm kind of regretting it right now. I'm definitely not working while I'm in college.


Sometime down the road, I have to take physics. PHYSICS. How am I going to pull that one off again?


Orientation was fun. I thought so anyways. I got a lot of questions out of the way, and stuff.



I went shopping a few days ago, and I bought a few totally hott outfits in American Eagle. I swear, I'm addicted. oh, oh, oh....and brown converse shoes. I <3 Chuck Taylors.

We close our eyes and dream
Another year has come and gone





You know, I was just sitting here, listening to music, and thinking. Everything was fine, and then the thought of graduating popped into my head. For the past few months, I have stated several times that ""I won't be afraid to graduate, I'm ready for it"". WELL, the truth is, that I'm not. Everytime I listen to a teacher's farewell speech, I cry. It's not the thought of college that scares me....it's more so the fact that this last week of school will be the last time I see most of the people in my class. Granted, a lot of them get under my skin, really bad, but, I have been around some of them since I was born. They have been with me through the most vital and influential parts of my life....my childhood, and my teenage years. Memories have been made, that will last forever. Right now, I kind of wish I could live in them....in the memories. Everyone says ""We will keep in touch"". No, we won't. We are moving on with our lives. Out with the old, and in with the new. It's over, and I don't want it to be. Manda is my best friend, in the whole entire world, and though it doesn't seem like it sometimes, I would do anything for her. However, what if we grow apart? It's quite possible. We are going to different colleges. What am I going to do? I thought I was mature enough to handle this, but now I'm doubting myself.

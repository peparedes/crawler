"event","Woohoo, now that I'm home, that means I have my AP scores, finally! They were as follows:

Biology: 5 (Fat load of good that does me... My adviser won't let me use this credit)
World Lit: 3 (Oh well, I'll live)
BC Calc: 5 (Yay, that gets me out of Freshman math altogether)
Spanish: 3 (Meh, doesn't matter anyway)

So, I was happy with my scores. Here are my classes for next year... I think I have to sign up for more, though...

Chem 115: Fundamentals of Chemisty (Lecture and lab)
Biol 115: Principles of Biology (Honors)
Psyc 101: Introduction to Psychology

I also have to take the requisite freshman course that gets us used to college life, but I haven't been assigned to a class yet. I think I'm going to sign up for Statistics, fencing, and maybe another class to get more GEC credit. I'll know once the school year starts, though

With all the sadness and trauma going on in the world at this moment, it is worth reflecting on the death of a very important person, which almost went unnoticed last week. Larry LaPrise, the man who wrote  ""The Hokey Pokey"" died peacefully at the age of 93.


The most traumatic part for his family was getting him into the coffin.


They put his left leg in.


And then the trouble started."

"event","Well, this sure has been fun. I'm sitting in my room in Florida, hanging out. It's beautiful weather down here, with the usual afternoon storms that are quite entertaining. Anyway, before this, I was at orientation at WVU, which was quite interesting for many reasons.

1. I got my ID, meaning free admission to Ravinia!
2. I also got my schedule, and I don't have any classes after 12:30 (except for monday, when I think I have a class at 1:30)
3. I've decided to double major in Forensic Examination and Forensic Biology, plus get a minor in Spanish. Since I scored well on my placement exam for Spanish, it seems I can achieve the minimum 15 hours necessary in just one semester.
4. I got to stay in my dorm (Not my actual room, though, since that was on the girls' floor). I like it a lot.
5. I took pictures of the campus. I'll post them somewhere when I get home.
6. I met some really cool people, including a couple other direct admissions to the Forensics program.
7. I got a new cellphone, with a number local to Morgantown.
8. I'm gonna be a Mountaineer Maniac next year, meaning I'm guaranteed a free ticket to all football and Men's Basketball games.
And finally...
9. There's a sixteen lane bowling alley in the basement of the main student commons area. We got to bowl on it for free, and it was quite fun.

Other than that, this past week has been pretty uneventful. I'm gonna spend these next couple weeks hanging out on the racquetball courts or by the pool, methinks. It should prove to be a lot of fun, despite the fact that I won't be sharing that time with the one person I really would like to... Or any of my other friends for that matter. But oh well, in two-ish weeks, I'll be back home livin' it up :)

send...couldn't help it!


     1. Two antennas met on a roof, fell in love   and
got married. The ceremony wasn't much, but the
reception was excellent. 

     2. A jumper cable walks into a bar. The bartender
says, ""I'll serve you, but don't start anything."" 

     3. Two peanuts walk into a bar and one was a
salted. 

     4. A dyslexic man walks into a bra. 

     5. A man walks into a bar with a slab of asphalt
under his arm and says:  ""A beer please, and one for
the road."" 

     6. Two cannibals are eating a clown. One says to
the other: ""Does this taste funny to you?"" 

     7. ""Doc, I can't stop singing 'The Green, Green
Grass of Home.'"" ""That sounds like Tom Jones
Syndrome."" ""Is it common?""  Well, ""It's Not  Unusual.""


     8. Two cows are standing next to each other in a
field.. Daisy says to Dolly, ""I was artificially
inseminated this morning."" ""I dont believe you,"" says
Dolly. ""It's true,  no bull!"" exclaims Daisy. 

     9. An invisible man marries an invisible woman.
The kids were nothing to look at either. 

    10. Deja Moo: The feeling that you've heard this
bull before. 

    11. I went to buy some camouflage trousers the
other day but I couldn't find any. 

    12. A man woke up in a hospital after a serious
accident. He shouted, ""Doctor, doctor, I can't feel my
legs!"" The doctor  replied, ""I know you can't - I've
cut off your arms!"" 

    13. I went to a seafood disco last week...and 
pulled a mussel. 

    14. What do you call a fish with no eyes? A  fsh. 

    15. Two fish swim into a concrete wall. The one
turns to the other and says ""Dam!"" 

    16. Two Eskimos sitting in a kayak were chilly, so
they lit a fire in the craft.  Unsurprisingly it sank,
proving once again that you can't have your kayak and
heat it too. 

    17. A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a
hotel and were standing in the lobby discussing their
recent tournament victories. After about an hour, the
manager came out of the office and asked them to
disperse. ""But why,"" they asked, as they moved off.
""Because"", he
    said, ""I can't stand chess-nuts boasting in an
open foyer."" 

    18. A woman has twins and gives them up for
adoption. One of them goes to a family in Egypt and is
named ""Ahmal.""  The other goes to a family in Spain;
they name him ""Juan."" Years later, Juan   sends a
picture of himself to his birth mother. Upon receiving
the picture, she
    tells her husband that she wishes she also had a
picture of Ahmal. Her husband responds, ""They're
twins! If you've seen Juan, you've seen Ahmal."" 

    19. Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, walked barefoot
most of the time, which produced an impressive set of
calluses on his feet. He also ate very little, which
made him rather frail and with his odd diet, he
suffered from bad breath. This made him. (Oh, man,
this is so bad, it's good. . .) A super calloused
fragile mystic hexed by halitosis. 
     20. And finally, there was the person who sent
twenty different puns to his friends, with the hope
that at least ten of the puns would make them laugh.  
  
    No pun in ten did."

I don't know when I will get the siren to go with the light and radio. Hopefully soon, but I wouldn't count on it :(

And for shits and giggles...


1. Reply with your name and I will write something random about you.
2. I will then tell you what song/movie reminds me of you.
3. I will pick a flavor of jello to wrestle with you in.
4. I will say something that only makes sense to you and me.
5. I will tell you my first memory of you.
6. I will tell you what color you remind me of.
7. I'll then ask you something that I've always wondered about you.
8. If I do this for you, you must post this on your LJ. (and be prepared to answer the question I ask in #7)

But on a similar note, as my subject line may hint, I have a slight deviation in my plans.

1.) I will not be doing my ordeal this Wednesday. Instead, I will be doing it the 27, 28, and possibly 29 of July. Which brings me to my next point.

2.) Due to lack of adults, we will not be going to the U.P. for Boy Scout camp, which gives me that entire week off, except for the aforementioned dates.

I guess that is a plus. I am kinda disappointed, though. The UP is fun.

1.) It was the first. Happy 10 months, Nicole!
2.) I finished my Camping Merit Badge, finally.
3.) Because of number 2, I could have a Scoutmaster Conference with my SM, for my Life Scout rank.
4.) The staff was nice enough to supply Evan Williamson and Jive Monkey (Don't ask) for a Board of Review that day.
5.) I passed the BoR and I am now a Life Scout! 
6.) The Order of the Arrow fire was that night, and I got tapped out! Now I can do my ordeal at Fall Conclave and be a member of the OA!

And that was just one day! This past week, I was also hiking in the Porcupine Mountains. I got to camp alongside a creek, and on Lake Superior. We hiked a total of 25 miles over 2 half-days and a full day. It was great!

Well, that is all for now. I have a plane to catch to Florida, so I must be off. Then Drum Major camp, then up to the UP for another Boy Scout camp. This summer is going too fast! I hope you all have a good rest of the summer.

"event","So, last night was a small social get-together for our school. Nothing big, just Prom.

Personally, I had a lot of fun. The music wasn't always that great, but I can live with it. Otherwise, the food was good, the company was good, and hanging out at Twans afterwards was fun

But now, I must get ready for we are going camping for the weekend (We being Nicole, Katelyn and I) which sounds like it will be a lot of fun.

Carpe Diem

"event","My lady give birth today
I run to her room right away
She smiles with glee, and hands her to me
I look at my newborn and say

Damn thats an ugly baby
Damn thats an ugly ass baby
I'm feeling quite concerned, my semen must have turned
Cause damn that's an ugly baby

This is just what I feared
Her head is mishapen and wierd
She's skinny like a twig, at least her nuts are big
But her hair color doesn't match her beard

Damn thats an ugly baby
Damn thats an ugly ass baby
I give the doc a smack and say can't you put her back in
Cause damn thats and ugly baby

And when she smiles I find
Shame McGallen comes to mind
It makes me want to cry
When I look into her good eye
I always wanted kids
Is it wrong to hope for SIDS
The doctor calles me in
Mr. Lynch she has a twin

Damn that's a good lookin baby
One for two on the good lookin babys
Now I start to weep, this one we can keep
Cause that was an ugly baby

She's got one good tooth and one ear and one eye
And thank God only one nose but it's on her left thigh
The thought of changing her diaper each day
Or powdering her ass with that tail in the way
I think I could get a good price on Ebay...

Damn thats an ugly baby
Damn thats an ugly ass baby
I give the doc a smack and say can't you put her back in
Cause damn thats and ugly baby



Sorry, I just couldn't resist. I had to put this song up here..."

1.Ear infection
2.Throat infection
3.Sinus infection

Needless to say, the next week or two are going to be fun.

"event","Ok, it is another entry, and a look into the life of myself. Today is on the books. Here, I will pose the same question that is currently haunting my away message: why am I in such a bad mood? I'm angry, sad, and lazy, all at the same time. Could it be because of the revelations I have had in the past hour? I will let you decide.

Revelation #1: No one tells me anything. I know I have said this for a while, but it has just hit me that it is true. Take today for example. At my church, I run lights and sound during the services, along with a man named John. He usually does it, but when he isn't there, I do it. Apparently, John was not there this morning. Did anyone tell me this? Of course not. Of all the past 6 or 7 times he has not been there, no one has told me so. At least I was at the late service today, so I could do sound for that one. But still, my point stands. 

Revelation #2: Adam was right. It may sound weird, and funny, but Adam was right. But not about stage managers, he was right about me. His comment was ""Stage managers are like carpet. You can walk all over them, and if they weren't there, you really wouldn't miss them."" I have realized that this holds true for myself. This ties into #1 above. I can count on one hand the number of people that would be a little ""off"" if I didn't exist. Also, my only reason for existence is to be used (Not the good kind of used that Nicole implies.) It just really pisses me off. Is there a video that needs to be played? Give it to Tom, even if its just 5 fucking minutes beforehand. Need a spot filled in in the band? Ask Tom. Then, tell him what he is doing wrong. Need your computer fixed? Ask Tom. He knows what he is doing. 

Where is the point in which I just say ""enough?"" Am I past that already? Why me? Why isn't there anyone else that can do what I can? Why does everyone walk all over me? Why are you still reading this. Comment if you want. I bid you adieu.

-Tom"

"event","I think my title says it all. Sorry I haven't posted in a while. Between all my classes, I have had zero time for myself in quite a long time. So, I guess that since I have a spare moment, I could update all my faithful lj followers. So, I guess I will do from the end of last week.

3 days of straight testing in physics (Thats 6 periods, for those who don't know) That totally sucked. Weekend, had a Boy Scout campout, in which it rained. My tent was flooded. Yay. But then again, it gave me an excuse to make a big fire to dry out all the stuff that got wet. So, I guess it wasn't all bad. 

This week was a pain. I had a 150 point rhetoric paper due on monday. That was about it for this week. It was just the little things, though, that ate up my time. And on Wednesday, I had variety show tryouts. Every act that tried out made the variety show, except the one that I was in. Just because we couldn't swear, and without the swearing, it wasn't funny.

""So... That makes you a... gay robot.""
""Yes. Thats right. I am a gay robot...""

""I bet we could pick up chicks in this thing. Like 2 or 3 chicks a piece.""
""What are you going to do with 2 chicks?""
""Man, women are like voltron. The more you hook up, the better it gets.""

THose were just some of the lines form our act. The act that got cut. But oh well, I will live. There is always next year. I think that is about it, except that THE QUARTER IS OVER! THERE IS A GOD! Sorry. I am just so happy that I only have 3 more quarters left of school this year. 

Tonight, I have a lock-in at my church, which sounds like it will be a ton of fun. I can't wait. So, until next time...

"event","Hey everyone. Sorry that I haven't posted in a while. I have been uber-busy. I have had a ton of homework, (Thanks a lot Ms. Glover), I was feeling a little sick, (No, it wasn't your fault Nicole), and I didn't really have anything to say. But, I guess I will update anyway. First of all, I am in a pretty good mood, because Nicole and I have officially been dating for about a month. Huzzah! That makes me so happy. The sad thing is, that I don't think I will get to see her this weekend. That kinda sucks, but then again, I have seen her for the past two weekends, so it isn't too bad.

Our marching band had competition yesterday, and for all of you who don't know, we definitely sucked. It was a personal best, but we still got fourth place out of four bands. Oh well. Maybe we won't suck in Marengo next week. *Stifles laughter*

And finally, the grand homework total for this weekend: Physics: book problems, a catapult lab, and a horsepower lab. Precalc: 2 book problems (not <i>too</i> bad). US History: a study guide for the Boston Massacre and the American Revolution. Spanish: Book problems, and a pesadilla, which I neglected to do for Friday, when it was due. Finally, I have a Rhetoric paper, which isn't due until Tuesday; but if I don't get it done now, it sure as hell won't get done Monday night.

My life rules, doesn't it? Well, I need to go get ready for church. Hasta Luego, y'all.

"event","Today was probably one of the best days I have had in a while. It started off crappy, because we got 3 extra homework problems because of some dicks who didn't clean up yesterday in physics. And, we had a quiz. Then, I totally bombed my Spanish oral. I remembered almost nothing of my script. Oh well. There were good points, though. Very good points.

A friend has asked me to build him a computer from scratch, and has allotted me a fairly generous budget with which to complete said device. It will be good.

My dad can't get into the BIOS of a laptop he is working on, so I may get to test out my password cracking skills.

I get to work on a broken computer and see if I can get it up and functioning again. Huzzah.

These, however, pale in comparison to the rest of the night. Nicole and I decided to go out to dinner, because this is probably the only free night that I will have in a while. We decided to go out for Thai food (hence the title). Needless to say, it was delicious. And spicy. That just made it more delicious. Then, we returned to her house and hung out for a while (2 hours?) and built a fire. Today was definitely good. I also got my bio turned in for the play. Possibly the shortest one I have written to date. Come see the play if you wanna know.

All in all, this was an amazing day. If anyone has anything else to add to this, feel free.

"event","Yeah, I really need to update, so I shall. Things are pretty good. I am hating AP Physics, but that is to be expected. I also have a new E-mail address, for those who didn't know. If I haven't sent you the E-mail, or if you never had my E-mail address to start off, my new address is ssj5pinfu@gmail.com. Thats right, I have a Gmail account. That makes me so happy. Also, I have an E-mail for work if you want to send me stuff there. It doesn't really matter. That one is tlilly@kildeerpolice.com. So that is about it for now.

I will do this week, because I can. Monday was fun, because it was Early release, and we got to break pasta bridges in Physics. Good times. 

Today was pretty cool. I got ""caught"" with Nicole in the large ensemble room. What were we doing? Hacking the pop machine. Good times. And I got to sleep during 4th hour. That is always good. That is about all that I did today, except for licking Ben's precalc book. MM MM good. He told me to. That is all I have to say for myself. And finally, I went to marching band today, and PG was there. Man, I hate that school. Fervent passion. So, now, I am just procrastinating, because I have a rhetoric paper to write. I am off to do that, I guess. And keep the anonymous comments coming in the previous entry. They are interesting

Well, on to slightly happier things. It was a 3-day weekend. A very good 3-day weekend. I played D&D Friday night, and Chase was there. And I didn't even kill him. I am so proud of myself. Lol. I would never kill Chase. Even though he killed everyone else. Except me. Teehee... Anywho... Saturday, I did nothing, so it doesn't bear mentioning.

Sunday and today, my family and I held parties for my brother, as we never had a proper graduation party for him. So thats where I was all day yesterday and today. And, of course, I neglected my homework until about 5 tonight. So right now, I am perched in front of my computer, typing up a rhetoric paper. 

That is about all I did this fabulous 3-day weekend. That is sad, isn't it? My entire 3 day weekend was summed up in about 2 paragraphs. *tear*

Also, Nicole and I are officially dating now. That makes me happy. Also, we had set crew today, even though I couldn't stay for very long. Also, I started teaching confirmation today, which was a lot of fun. I got to show the entire class the lunchlady song by Adam Sandler and Chris Farley. So all in all, today was a very good day.

"event","Life sucks. It is the first offical weekend of school, and I am already sick. And not like the sniffles sick, but like really sick. I have a fever, runny nose, upset stomach, etc. This means that doing the Physics lab is going to suck, because I have to stake out a traffic light. Really gonna suck. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can feel better?

"event","Well, I finally finished my rhetoric homework. And my AP Physics homework. I am finally finished with homework for this summer. That, my friends, is what we call a good thing. This weekend was pretty good. I got to spend the majority of yesterday with Nicole at V.A. just hangin out. The only bad thing was that I was feeling pretty bad this morning, as in sick. I had to go to church, though, and play my saxophone. That was not good. I got through it, though, and I am feeling marginally better. 

Next week is going to suck, yet rule at the same time. 

Reasons to suck:
     1.) look at my schedule
     2.) I have a locker down band hallway, which means I have to carry most of my books to my classes
     3.) I have to take the bus to school
     4.) I have to get this whole deal with Kaylie dealt with (small explanation below)
     

Reasons to rule:
     1.) I get to see people I haven't seen in a while
     2.) Jensen announces the musical
     3.) Set crew will supposedly start
     4.) I like most of my classes, it is just a huge load

Alright, here is an explanation of what is bugging me the most about next week. No, Kaylie and I are not technically dating as of now. We both made promises to each other that we would get back together at the beginning of next school year. Neither of us are apt at breaking promises, so we will uphold it. But Kaylie wants to know what will happen next year. The problem is, that nothing will happen next year. We will be dating again, but not for very long. Then, we will go our separate ways, and date other people. Her, probably the person she is dating now, and me, Nicole. 

I am just really angry at the way that our relationship ended, as it almost seems like a year of my social life was put down the drain, and that makes me very sad. Especially since Kay and I wanted to stay friends, but that is seeming doubtful as of now. This really sucks.

But then again, I guess I am almost looking forward to the final split, as it gives a sense of finality to our relationship. I am also looking forward to dating Nicole, as she is an amazing person. 

I guess that is all I have to say for now, and I just wanted to get that off my chest. Thank you to all that took the time to read this. And feel free to comment, positively or negatively.

Seize the day,
Tom"

Nicole gets back today from her trip to Montana. I won't be able to see her, though. I have marching band. Huzzah... Oh well. There are more days in the week

I am finished annotating the given articles for Rhetoric. Therfore, I only have a 600 word paper to write, another article to find and annotate, and then another 200 word paper to write. All by Tuesday. This kind of sucks. Oh well. I will live.

Finally, I contacted sapphire (the people who make my video card) and told them about my problems with it. They suggested that I RMA (Returning merchandise agreement) it. That means I send it back to my dealer, and they send me a new one. That means my computer will be down for a couple weeks. That means no (g)aim, so don't expect me to be on after Saturday or so. Sorry, all.

I guess that is all that is new in my life (and others') so until next time...

Nothing much is new with me. I had band camp these past two weeks, and I had a lot of fun. Especially getting in trouble, and having to carry the sousaphone up to the band room. Man, did that suck. Its not like I do that EVERY DAY ANYWAY! (For those of you who don't know, the sucking part was sarcastic) They really need to think of new ways to punish people. Like maiming them. That would work... Sorry. I'm done ranting. For now...

What else is new? I registered today, and got my schedule. Huzzah. For those of you who care, it is as follows: 

1. AP physics - Glover
2. AP physics - Glover
3. P.E.
4. Hon college algebra - Orsi?/ hon precalc - Orsi 
5. US History - Terhar/ Pellikan
6. Band - Mr. B
7. Acc spanish III - Sra. Lutter
8. AP Rhetoric - Koch
9. AP Comp. Sci. - Timmerman

(All classes are the same both semesters and 5 days a week)

Isn't that a fun schedule? If anyone has classes conmigo, let me know...

Well, that was my update. I know it wasn't too much, but maybe now that monkey won't come and visit/kill me...

"event","Well, my last 2 weeks have been uneventful. I did get a chance to see 2 movies, though. Spiderman 2 and Dodgeball: a true underdog story. I would recommend both to anyone. Today, however, is my last day in Florida, which means I should be home sometime later this week. I haven't been home since the middle of June, so I am looking forward to getting home and 1)sleeping in my own bed, 2) talking to people I haven't talked to in the near-month that I have been gone, and 3) get back to my computer, and work on it. All in all, this has been a fun month, between JLT and Florida, but nonetheless, I can't wait to get home.

Until next time,
Tom

P.S. I have also been reading quite a bit. These are the books:

A Hymn Before Battle - John Ringo
Gust Front - John Ringo
When the Devil Dances - John Ringo
Deep Black: Biowar - Can't remember the author offhand
Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance - Robert M. Pirsig

If you get the chance, they are all good books, depending on your tastes."

Then, my family had a party for my brother's graduation, which he couldn't be at, because he had summer theatre. How much does that suck? Then, as I was packing, I discovered that I lost my summer reading for Rhetoric next year. That means that I will get an F on the first assignment of the year, if I don't find someone to get the articles from.

Back to my fun summer. I am at JLT until next Saturday. I leave straight from there to go to Florida for two and a half weeks, meaning that starting tomorrow, I won't be home for about a month. THen, the last week in July, I have another Boy Scout camp to go to, then summer band right after that. Therefore, my summer is about over. At least the part at home. How much does this suck? A lot. Sorry for this rant, and sorry to leave you all on a bad note, but this is how it is. I will not be home for about a month, so I won't update for a while.

I also got Blue COllar Comedy tour, which is some hilarious stuff. If you ever get a chance to watch it, you should. And if you want a little taste of it, I just made about 5 away messages based around some topics. My SN is in my info. I am also ready for VBS at my church next week, which I have to run lights and sound for. I am also prepping for Junior Leader Training for Boy Scouts, which starts next weekend. Then, I go right from there to Florida for about 3 weeks, so its working hard, and then a vacation, where I get to do all my summer reading for Rhetoric next year. Huzzah. I guess that is all for now. Until next time, I leave you with a little blue collar comedy tour.

I was riding a plane, and as I got off, I went to get my baggage. Of course, it wasn't there, so I went to the missing baggage department. I went up to the counter, and I told the lady that my baggage was missing. She says ""Well, has your plane landed yet?"" ""No! I'm just having an out-of-body experience! I just wanted to check on my luggage!"" Here's your sign."

School was the main way that I saw friends, and now that the year is over, I will probably not see many people over the summer that I had a lot of fun hanging out with over the year, such as Paul, Nicole, Will, etc. And it doesn't help that Paul is going off to college next year. :'(. This sucks. That, and since the year is over, Kaylie and I are officially not going out until either next week, if she accepts me asking her out again, or when the school year starts again. I don't think I can wait that long. I can't stand being away from her. And the sad thing is, there is no way to let her know how I feel. It just can't be put into words. This really sucks.

That is enough bad. There are some good things about the year being over. No more classes: Yay! This makes me happy. They were definitely getting to be annoying. What else? Oh yeah: I am now an upper classman! GO JUNIORS! Two more years of High-school, then 8-10 more at UIC. Won't that just be fun? I think that is all that has been good over the year. Oh well. I will live. I must get to bed now, as I am uber tired. So until next time, this is me, signing off..."

<blockquote>So, I was minding my own business this wonderful Monday night. I had decided to catch up on some reading for AP Art History. Fate had a different plan. I saw bright lights reflected into my canyon and I remembered seeing my block being closed off earlier in the day. I decided to snoop. I walked to the end of my block and, low and behold, there was filming going on. I thought to myself, I might just pee a little if it's Veronica Mars. I walked up to some guy and he said he thought it was a movie shoot. I got really bummed until I saw him...Jason Dohring (Thankfully, my bladder was able to keep its cool). I went from a relaxed stance to a full-on sprint back to my house to get my dvd box for anyone to sign. When I got back, I watched the scene they were filming. Man, I didn't realize how much work and time goes into a fifty second scene (They filmed that one scene for about 2 hours). Anyways, the scene was between Logan and Veronica. SPOILER ALERT....They made out. It definitely looked like they were back together. They were holding hands and being all cute; it was fantastic! I was able to get Jason Dohring's signature and he was so nice. He asked me how close I lived (if only he wanted to stalk me; too bad he's married) and how I became a fan. Then he told me about the viewing they had in Texas and I told him I had seen him at Comic Con. It was great. Ahhhhhh. I had to share that with you guys because my friends think I'm crazy to love a tv show as much as I love Veronica Mars. I wasn't able to get Kristen's signiture because she was always surrounded by people. She was alone when they wrapped and she was walking to her car, but I didn't want to harangue her on the sidewalk. I decided to let her get into her warm car. Nevertheless, it was awesome. Da Vinci painted what?

Okay, to sum up...I'm a freak, and it definitely looks like LoVe is in the air.</blockquote>"

It's me again, your friendly neighbourhood beggar.  I'm not trying to be a pain, I'm merely trying to help a friend in need.    

You're already acquainted with the lovely <lj user=""dark_inamorata""> aka Suki.  She's one hell of a tough nut.  She's got four kids, the youngest two having been born in little over a year of one another, finances are nonexistant, and she's currently battling a nasty golf sized tumour in her brain.  She's trying hard, and the one thing that makes her happy (as well as generating much needed cash) is sewing.  Her machine broke recently, and it looks like it'll be $300 to fix it.  I'd like to achieve a bare minimum of $300 - but with the holidays coming up, anything else will be sent for some presents for the kids.

I've supposedly got over 150 people who read my journal.  If each of those people gave me $10 to donate to Suki and her family, I'd have over $1500 - but I'm being realistic.  All I'm asking for is 30 of you to donate $10, or 60 of you to donate $5.....the cost of a movie ticket to bring a smile to someone's face. 

If you can't donate, I ask that you please either refer people directly to this post, or just cut and paste it in your own journal.  The more the word gets around, the better chance there is of making her happy again.  

Please guys, it's the holidays.  Send any donations, via paypal, to: kirawestwood@yahoo.com</blockquote>"

<blockquote>The Bertinelli was the style that truly dominated that era. The Bertinelli had at its core a flat, smooth top with a precise center-parting with very neatly arranged feathered-back wings on both sides. Many of you today look back at that style in horror and would not believe that fans like us exist.</blockquote>"

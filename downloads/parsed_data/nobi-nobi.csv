He notices a 6 pack and asks, ""Then who are these for?"" ""Those are for college men,"" the dad answers, TWO for Friday, TWO for Saturday, and TWO for Sunday.""

""WOW!"" exclaimed the boy, ""then who uses THESE?"" he asks, picking up a 12 pack!

With a sigh and a tear in his eye, the dad replied, ""Those are for the married men. ONE for January, ONE for February, ONE for March....etc.""

Over the weekend my family received news from Vietnam that my grandpa, who was in his eighties, passed away......

My dad along with seven of his brothers and sisters flew back for the funeral the same night.  My uncle said that upon arriving at my grandparents' house, where my grandpa's body was lying until the funeral, my dad couldn't stop crying. Throughout my entire life, I have never seen my dad shed a single tear.  It shows how much my grandpa meant to him...

So until then, I've been enjoying my days by playing pool.  It's so addicting, even Bobby started playing too...except the beefalo plays using a ruler...and still misses =P.  I can't stop making fun of him...I'm sowwies!! =P

Other than pool, the fishies have been keeping us very entertained.  Chibo's black fish has an eating disorder...umm, the kind where it can't stop eating.  And you know what comes in must find its way out....Poor fish was swimming around with a long strand of...stuff...hanging from its bootie. Bobby's fish and my fish apparently likes to nibble on that long strand from Chibo's bootie....all I can say is EWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!  My fish took in the whole strand!....sooooo disgusting....good thing it spat it back out. =/  Hong and Rami's fishies are very territorial.  They like to pick on the other fishies, chasing them around, etc.  Hopefully they'll all get along well, live happily in the fish tank, eat lots of food, grow very big so I can eat them =P umm..j/k about that last part hehehehe......"

So I've moved into another apartment and although I miss my old housemates, my new housemates are awesome =).  Random silliness, eating together at odd hours, etc haha.  I cleaned up the big mess I made.  Bought a new desk, bookcase, storage stuff, etc and the room now looks complete.  Rami helped me put together my entire desk and bookcase, thank you soooo much! (Thanks to Chibo also =P) The whole time we were pounding nails, Hong was dead asleep. She is such a workaholic, she even dreams about work!  But yeah, Chibo and I are pretty good at rearranging and organizing rooms, wanna hire us to do yours??? =P hahaha j/k."

Should go pack and drive home but that would just be insane driving during traffic hour and no carpool.

Should go pack some stuff to take home now.  Gonna take home stuff I don't need in Davis so I have less to move later on. I have a crapload of stuff to pack before moving out at the end of this month.  Can't believe I'll have only 3 weeks left here.  We've had our shares of ups and downs in this house, but I know I will miss Club2012 for all of its great moments.  The fun times we've had with cooking festive meals for the holidays haha, our crazy parties, late night walks, house trip to san francisco, driving through creepy road to get to the beach late at night, and so much more.  The stupid things we've done like lighting towels on fire...(ok, that was just me =P ), defrosting shrimp by throwing it down the back patio, feeding jello to fellow housemates by dropping it from the loft and into their mouths, targetting loretta's window across the parking lot with ""grape canons"", the raining bras, the scandalous lingerie posters, the boobie balloons, the yelling, the screaming, the laughing, the moaning heard by unexpected visitors (like Tamo), the educational sex talks, the sex....haha just kidding about that last one! =P...*sigh*...I will miss you girls a lot..."

Yay! At home now =).  Been eating mucho again hahaha.  Today Bobby and I went to Kim Wong and her friends' bbq at Santa Clara Central Park...wow, it's such a big park.  There's everything there, bbq area, tennis courts, baseball field, little stadium, even a big swimming pool.  We ates lots but I still wasn't satisfied so on our way home we stopped by Euro Delights Bakery...that place has the prettiest cakes and other desserts =).  That's also the place where I got Kim Nguyen's bday cake.  So I couldn't help myself and picked up coffee mousse cakes, tiramisu cake, mango moussse cake, and even pickled mangoes hehehe =).  Bobby was like ""geez, how many cakes are u getting, piggie!"" and the sales lady looked at me and smirked.  Haha, I don't deny, I am a piggie =P cuz I came home and ate some more during dinner with my parents!!  

Tomorrow I'm going on a date with Phan...lunch date haha (more food =P).  Hopefully I'll study a bit before I head back to Davis on Sunday cuz it's gonna be crazy next week.  

My roomie Kim Wong is also moving out next week!! =(  She's also gonna leave the country for a while...I'm gonna miss her, she was a reallly great roommate and friend =).  Now bring me back some souveniers!!! hahaha j/k =P.  Hope you have a blast over there!"

"event","<P>Marine World on Friday with Bobby, Kim, and Imchung was awesome! =) It was fun meeting Imchung and going on rides with her. &nbsp;She's a real screamer.&nbsp; Bobby and I couldn't stop cracking up when she kept going on and on with her screaming.&nbsp; Made the rides so much more enjoyable =)&nbsp; Medusa was so much fun, we call it the 'Top Gun' of Marine World.&nbsp;&nbsp; Too bad Imchung didn't go on that one!&nbsp; Also got to see dolphins, whales, seals, and so much more.&nbsp; </P>

<P>The past weekend had its share of joy and pain.&nbsp; To celebrate our 1 yr anniversary, Bobby and I had plans to go to Marine World.&nbsp; Being the lazy bums that we are, we didn't wake up early enough....although that didn't stop us!&nbsp; We printed our tickets, drove for about 15 mins and changed our mind.&nbsp; Instead of Marine World, we shopped in Vacaville hehehe =).&nbsp; No worries though! Marine World is still on! We intend on going this Friday and hopefully get some friends to come also.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Dinner at Soga's&nbsp;: The setting was romantic, the food was delicious, and THE WAITRESS WAS HOT!&nbsp; What more can a girl ask for??? =P</P> <center>

<P>~We had miscommunication about what time we were gonna go out...about 3 hours of a difference haha.</P>
<P>~Bobby arrives at my place.&nbsp; We were ecstatic about our date, but as we were heading out, his car dies. (I'm sorrry about your car =(.....but at least I got to drive on our date!! =).)</P>
<P>~We went shopping.&nbsp; Where at you might ask?&nbsp; Ghetto Eastridge Mall (which is still under construction =P).</P>
<P>~Dinner: McDonald's delicacies - Cheeseburgers, Big Mac, and McChicken Sandwich!!! And we ate in the car while driving to the movies...talk about multitasking.&nbsp; </P>
<P>~Movie: ""Unleashed"" (w/ Jet Li =) ) at the Cinelux Cinema Saver 10 in Milpitas.&nbsp; The name oughta tell you how ghetto it is =P (but hey, $3.50 for a movie anytime! Can't beat that!)</P>
<P>~Got home around midnight,&nbsp;tried to jumpstart his car but failed.&nbsp; Sat around watching T.V. and looking at old photos of my family and of me as a kid....super ghetto =P. I was talking about me, I was such an oogly kid, and still am. </P>
<P>Yet somehow it was one of the best dates we've had! I had a blast! =)</P>

Since his car didn't work, I drove him to his friend's house afterwards so he can have a slumber party with his some of his guy friends =P."

"event","<P>Conan O'Brien is hilarious. </P>
<P>Tonight he had a guest on the show, Steven Lamm, the author of that book <EM>The Hardness Factor</EM>.&nbsp; You should know what the book is about based on the title ;-) . So maybe you already know (well I sure didn't, but then again I'm pretty uninformed about the male species and what I know are stuff my bf tells me haha) that being a fat lazy ass who smokes and treating ur body like trash will make your little friend well ...little....and soft...and...u get the point.&nbsp; So spare yourself from having the penis of a fifty year old man, go exercise and eat well.&nbsp; The hardness of your penis can determine how healthy you are and vice versa haha.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Best part of the show...he broke out with this device called the Rigidometer.&nbsp; So the point is to stick your excited friend in it, hold for five seconds, and it measures the hardness.&nbsp; Nifty little thing...I want one, not that I have any use for it.&nbsp;But I can stick anything in it and it'll measure the hardness haha.....shut up, I'm not weird!&nbsp; So Conan stuck his thingie in and the reading was 500.&nbsp; The average measurement for a 15 yr. old guy (usally the age where it's the hardest it can be) is somewhere around 2000.&nbsp; Yea he's older, but 500???? Uh oh Conan.....</P>
<P>I'm kidding, it was his finger that he inserted in the Rigidometer.&nbsp;It was late night T.V., not porn!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Anywho, to go off on a tangent,&nbsp;I'm thinking of going&nbsp;running tomorrow morning.&nbsp; Key word = thinking.&nbsp; I wish I was a guy, then there would be so much more motivation to work out =P.&nbsp; </P>"

<P>The past few days have been really fun! Phan came to visit so we did a lot of random stuff like renting a really bad movie, eating Ciocolat in the park with no lights, bought fabric because we're ambitious ppl who think we can sew our own clothes, hung out at Fry's haha, and ate lots of yummy food like cake, baked jello (yes, we ""baked"" jello =P) Fuji's buffet, Cafe Italia, Thai2K, and Chevy's (yummy watermelon margarita ^_^).&nbsp;I was supposed to drive her back Friday night, but since my awesome Biomedical Engineering classmates wanted to go rafting, Phan stayed til saturday so she could join in on the fun.&nbsp; Bobby also stayed instead of going home for the weekend&nbsp;=).&nbsp; After rafting, Bobby and I drove her back to Berkeley&nbsp;and we had Steve's Korean BBQ again! *droooling*&nbsp; And of course we ended the night with 5 episodes of 24 Season 4 =).&nbsp; This season is by far the best!&nbsp;</P>

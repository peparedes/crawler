Hmm.  I disagreed with a girl friend that the book was slow-starting.  I was hooked from the first chapter.  However, it was very quick-ending.  And that, my friends, is why I wouldn't recommend it.  Is all that time spent guessing and waiting worth the ending?  Hell no.  It's a shame that all that fancy education still did not teach this poor a girl a thing about novels having to have some sort of worthy conclusion."

Oh my goodness.  This is a must read, though it is totally unlike anything I've seen from him before."

Often, I hate Nicolas Cage.  Today, I love him.  This movie got poor reviews and I know why.  No one learns any lessons and nothing changes.  It was refreshing, to say the least.  Even the violence was not quite as offensive because it was seen in an almost arbitrary light.  Yay."

Though my first encounter with this particular author was pure science
fiction, it in no way deterred me from this book. Is it icky? Oh my
yes. Is it bizarre? To the max. And yet, it was marvelous. Not at all
bad for a first novel. If only he hadn't gone and began bloody writing
about space and other such nonsense. Ha."

Geek Love - by: Katherine Dunn

Don't be dissuaded by the initial plot set-up.  It may be bizarre, but it is more than the sum of its parts.  I'm not going to use the phrase 'triumph of the human spirit', because it's not that in the slightest.  It's just a great book."

"event","I frequent Rotten.com.  The pictures are a pick-me-up every now and again, as I am fascinated by gore, but what interests me most is their collection of news stories.  Now, although the number of articles that deal with odd child abuses never ceases to amaze me, it's the special interest group revolution that ruffles the hell out of my feathers.

My example of the day:  AIDS awareness groups are up in arms over an episode of Family Guy.

Of all the useless things to have a fit about...  I don't feel the need to go into at length, because I think it's quite obvious that I find the situation ludicrous.  Unless there is force involved when you are exposed to things that offend you, you've got nothing to bitch about.  Don't watch that show.  Don't read that web-page.  Don't listen to the music.  Don't don't don't... and shut the bloody hell up.  

Also, I don't want to hear a word about influence.  Everyone chooses how they wish to behave and believe and everything else.  And if certain individuals are easily swayed by the media with which they come into contact... sucks for them.  Life is always really boring when everyone likes the same things."

This should be a quick one. Last Sunday I got the flu and boy, what a ride it has been. I wound up in an ambulance and took a trip to the emergency room last Monday night. I had a fever of 101.5 and I couldn't see straight or walk properly. I knew it was the flu, and after a few tests, it was determined to be nothing beyond that. It was better to be safe than sorry, however. There was some concern among people I know that it could be H1N1, but thankfully it wasn't. I've lost about 15 pounds since I've had the flu, and I'm almost fully recovered. I can't recall ever having been that sick in my entire life. My mom has been taking great care of me, as have a few of my friends at my place.<br /><br />This isn't the first time I've had the flu, but there was something in this flu bug that has had a profound impact on my life. I hate to use the term &quot;life changing&quot; as I wasn't dying or anything (though I certainly felt like I was at times) but ever since I got this virus, a lot of things have been put into perspective for me. For one, I can't even stand the smell of marijuana smoke anymore, and I just shudder anytime I see pot-related paraphanalia. I know it sounds like the same old thing, but I am finished smoking weed for good. No more &quot;well, just one last time with my buddies&quot; or anything like that. Even when I chill with my boys from up north again, I won't touch the stuff. If you can't respect that, don't expect to see me around. I know it's not the reason I got sick, but I have wanted to quit for some time and whatever is in this flu bug gave me the kick in the ass I needed to give it up.<br /><br />If my recovery continues to progress at it's current rate, I should be out and about all week, finally getting my life in gear. Another thing that I dawned upon was that I no longer want to prove people wrong in life. That's not fair to those that have always believed in me. My purpose in life is to reward the faith of the people who have stuck with me through thick and thin throughout the years; to show them that they stuck with me for a reason. I will still use some of that fuel from the doubters to push myself, but the main purpose being to reward the believers. It's the people like Danielle, Nick (I know we don't speak now but trust me, he's seen it all with me), Jay, Rashad, Joe, Rachel, Frank...ect. that I want to reward. I want to better myself so that&nbsp;I may help others better themselves. We all have a major turning point in our lives, and I believe this is one of them. Rome wasn't built in a day, but I'm sure it was one hell of a ride.<br /><br />I hate to cut this short, but my laptop battery is getting pretty low, and I feel like going to sit in the hot tub at the Y for a bit, so i'll do just that.</span><span style=""font-size: large;""> Enjoy the rest of your day folks!<br /><br /></span><span style=""font-size: large;"">-Paul C.</span>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: large;"">Good day everyone, I hope all is well and that you're all enjoying this beautiful weather we're having. Even in Timmins it's been really warm and the snow is melting rapidly, according to my dad. Can't Timmins have just&nbsp;ONE icy cold, snow-filled winter when&nbsp;I'm not there?</span><span style=""font-size: large;""> I'm talking 4 feet of snow and temperatures hovering around -40 on a daily basis. Basically, the real-life version of Hell freezing over, lol! Just once is all&nbsp;I ask. I may actually sell my soul to make this happen. Stay tuned.<br /><br />A few days ago, I randomly ran into one of my buddies from college, Greg. It was unbelievable. I was thrilled. I went downstairs in the lobby at my place to see my buddy Dan, and then Greg came walking in and we were both like &quot;Whoa, what's up?&quot; He said he wants to play basketball with me again soon and I said I'm looking forward to it. If you'll recall, Greg was this 6'5 guy on my intramural basketball team who dunks like I breathe. No way we make the finals without him. <br /><br />Greg is one of the guys I played with that knows just how good a player I can be, and he witnessed me at my best first hand. Maybe my shooting was off because of my broken wrist, but I more than made up for it on defense. Of all the guys I've played basketball with up north, Jay is probably the only guy who would fit in seamlessly on my college intramural team. No offense to the northern ballers, as I have great respect for them (well, moreso Timmins High), but the level of competition down here, even in intramurals, is way better than any runs you can find up north.<br /><br />I'm still on the job hunt. I had an interview on Friday at a place called Global Air Care, which is essentially a company that manufactures and distributes home air filtration systems. The interview went well and I was told to call them back between 4:30pm-5pm that evening to find out if I had been hired. From 4:30pm to 7pm, I called every 5 minutes and the line was busy. Quite a company eh? In retrospect, it's kind of amusing. The head of the company had a pair of 19th century firearms framed in his office. Now THAT is a boss i'd like to work for.<br /><br />If you haven't already seen the movie called &quot;The Cove&quot; I highly recommend either downloading it, renting it or purchasing it.&nbsp;Whether marines mammals interest you or not, it's a must watch for all animal lovers and basically, anyone with a soul.<br /><br />I thought this would be a longer blog, but I'm getting stir crazy and feel like going out again. It's too nice to just be cooped up inside all day. Granted, I've been doing some reading (Bill Simmons &quot;Book of Basketball&quot;) but I can continue with that later on tonight.<br /><br />Enjoy the rest of your day folks!<br /><br />-Paul&nbsp;C.<br /></span>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: large;"">Good afternoon everyone,</span> <span style=""font-size: large;"">I hope your day has gotten off to a fantastic start. Mine sure has.<br /></span><br /><span style=""font-size: large;"">The first thing&nbsp;I did today was get my rent paid, as it's the smart thing to do. My mom's birthday is tomorrow so I am going to get her something nice and make sure she has an awesome day. Later on today, i'll be getting a haircut. It's long overdue, to say the least. I should donate my hair to a cancer organization that makes wigs for cancer patients. It's thick enough and would probably make two wigs. Well actually, i'd like to donate part of my hair to Raiders owner Al Davis. Come on man, get rid of the toup&eacute; already!<br /><br />I've been watching the Olympics and it's just been awesome. The Canada-USA hockey game was just insane. We dominated them but the goals Canada gave up were just slopp</span><span style=""font-size: large;"">y plays by some of team Canada's elder statesmen. Luckily we bounced back against the Swedes, so we get to play&nbsp;Russia. This should be a fun match up. And yes, I will be not-so-secretly rooting for Alex Ovechkin. I'm sorry, but if Jason effing Whitehead can be a fan of Ovie, then I have every right to cheer for him (and him alone) in a game against team&nbsp;Canada. Remember, Jay is the guy who hates hockey more than anything. I'm pretty sure hockey is on his Mount Rushmore of sports hatred, along with the following 3 people: Carmelo Anthony, Bill Laimbeer, and Rajon Rondo. So there.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: large;"">The weather here in Hamilton has been great. There was a bit of a snowstorm (by their standards) on Monday. They actually closed the library early due to inclement weather.&nbsp;Of course, those same people made the brilliant decision to turn on the fans full blast here in the food court when I sat down to browse the web on my laptop. This may be a novel concept to some people, but if you're closing the library due to inclement weather, why would you then proceed to make the people inside the building freeze their asses off? This isn't &quot;The Day After Tomorrow.&quot; I half-expected to walk outside and see half the city buried in snow, with Dennis Quaid lurching towards the door to try and rescue the others trapped inside the mall.<br /><br />The NBA trading deadline passed last week and Amare Stoudemire is still a Phoenix Sun. That is somewhat surprising. I hate to say it, but Steve Kerr is among the worst GM's in the NBA. Granted, he's being handcuffed by Robert &quot;Penny Pincher&quot; Sarver, but they had to have known that Amare is going to bolt this summer. They won't get anything in return for him, unless the Knicks take pity on the Suns and offer them Al Harrington in a sign and trade. Way to waste Steve Nash's career. Kerr, you're a great color commentator. It's your destiny to be an all-time great NBA&nbsp;color commentator. I think even Suns fans would agree with me here. Actually, they probably have about 27 different chapters of &quot;Fire Sarver&quot; in the Phoenix and Glendale area. Suns fans, make your choice.<br /><br />I have more to type about but I'm starting to get hungry. Ugh, the lady who just sat down next to me has the worst smelling french fries ever. It's as if she literally fried them in piss and vinegar. I'm no longer hungry anymore.<br /><br />Have an awesome day folks.<br /><br />regards,<br />Paul C.<br /></span>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: large;"">Welcome back to my blog, loyal readers (the 3 of you that actually read this blog, haha). It's been awhile since my last blog entry, due to technical issues with my laptop. I'm happy to announce that my laptop is as good as new and I will be posting blogs on a regular basis once again.<br /><br />I'm not sure where to start, seeing as how it's been so long.</span> <span style=""font-size: large;"">I moved here to Hamilton on December 30th, which I felt was a much needed change of scenery for me. Waterloo is probably the most serene city&nbsp;I've ever lived in and i'll likely move there again someday. The house I lived in was nice, and at least one of my roommates was cool.<br /><br />The best way I can describe Matt (the roommate I couldn't stand) is that he is the step-father I never had. I'm sure he meant well at times, but I was going through a really tough time and I made it clear from the beginning that&nbsp;I needed my space and that any issues you had were to be explained to me in a civilized manner.<br /><br />Even before I moved in, I explained to Matt that I was extremely depressed&nbsp;(having lost Fluke on November 5th, which, based on what I went through, was akin to someone with a cast on their leg doing attempting to do yoga or pilates).</span> <span style=""font-size: large;"">What did Matt do? Nit-picked the shit out of everything I did, from my cooking ability to my job searching habits. Look, anyone who has experienced depression knows that you barely eat, let alone cook an elaborate meal. If you choose to eat when you're depressed, you just want the food to taste half decent, that's it.<br /></span><br /><span style=""font-size: large;"">The best part of everything that he was doing was the fact that he was a blatant hypocrite the entire time. Look for a job? I was doing that, but because he never saw me doing it, he criticized me. He was on welfare and all day he would sit and game in his room. Oh, and the creme de la creme: he had a wife and kids who lived with her and her parents in another city, while he was living where I did gaming and blazing all the time. Granted, I did my fair share of blazing when I lived there, but still, it was rather comical.<br /><br />One of the best nights I had in Waterloo was the night when Harmony came to visit. We'd known each other for over 3 years via the Irishman, but we had yet to meet. I walked my dog Theo to meet her downtown, then we walked back to my place.&nbsp;On the walk back, we witnessed a car accident, which was pretty bad ass if you ask me. A van turned into a lane without signaling and was blindsided by a car. Of course, being the attention-seeking showman that&nbsp;I am, and always looking to put a funny spin on things, I yelled out &quot;CHOO&nbsp;LOSE! Enjoy the jacked insurance rates, hahaha!&quot; much to Harmony's chagrin. Okay, she laughed a little. Meh, a stupid driving decision deserves an equally stupid response from some passersby.<br /><br />After we got back to my place, I noticed my roommates were blazing so I decided to join them while we all chilled in the living room. Harmony didn't mind my getting baked despite her presence, which was nice. I told her beforehand that&nbsp;I'm perfectly fine when I'm high (hahahahahahahaha!!!!!!) so to prove a point, I got extremely baked and somehow managed to avoid saying anything dumb or weird. My subconscious knew better</span><span style=""font-size: large;"">, I suppose. Harmony adored the two cats who were living at the house, Reckless and Lean. She was fawning over Lean in particular, as she is a tiny kitten. She wanted to steal Lean and I unsuccessfully attempted to get her to go through with it, haha!</span> <span style=""font-size: large;"">After a few hours of chilling and gaming, I walked her to the bus stop and waited until her bus came.<br /><br />I spent New Year's in Toronto, which was a first for me. Even after 3 years, it still feels weird to go back to the city where I got engaged for the first time. I do think about&nbsp;Marie when I'm there, to be honest with you. I rode the subway for the first time since I dated her, and I was actually surprised it didn't upset me, despite the time that has lapsed. Wherever Marie is,&nbsp;I hope she's doing fantastic.</span><span style=""font-size: large;""> She deserves it.<br /><br />I spent that evening with my mom and a bunch of her friends, and a few of their kids. Thankfully, Chris (Debbie's son) is my age, so I had someone to just chill with for most of the night. I took a lot of goofy and funny pictures that night, which I posted on facebook. We wound up watching the ball drop in Nathan Phillips Square. It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. It was a beautiful night, the women were equally gorgeous, and I met some people who&nbsp;I added to facebook. The only way the night could have been better would have been if I had gotten a New Year's kiss (which has still eluded me after 24 years) and had Papa Roach been the band playing live that night, as opposed to some no-name rock group that literally no one had heard of. It was really funny when the host (some MTV guy) yelled out to the crowd asking if they had heard of the band (whose name has slipped my mind) and the crowd went silent. He attempted this twice. After the second attempt, the crowd just lost it and everyone had a good laugh. <br /><br />The first thing I yelled out when the new year arrived was &quot;I&nbsp;LOVE&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;FLUKEY!&quot; in honor of my dog. A few people (somehow) heard me and thought it was cute. </span><span style=""font-size: large;"">That's going to be the first phrase I utter every new year until the day&nbsp;I die.</span> <span style=""font-size: large;"">What, like you expected anything else? It's Fluke, come on</span><span style=""font-size: large;"">!<br /><br />A few weeks ago, I did one of the dumbest things of my life and took two Oxycontin's while I was partying at a friends place. I almost died that night, which was one of the scariest things I've ever experienced in my life. I will always be convinced that Fluke was watching over me that night, as there is no way I should have survived, when you factor in I took half a morphine pill and two other muscle relaxants in addition to taking the Oxy's. I hadn't realized taking two Oxy's could kill you until someone conveniently told me after I had popped the second pill. Regardless, it was mistake I will never make again. I have healthier appreciation for life and believe that Fluke saved my life because he wants to see me succeed in life, which&nbsp;I will.</span><span style=""font-size: large;""><br /><br />I celebrated my 24th birthday on February 9th, as many of you know. It was my first birthday without Fluke since I turned 12. I made the best of it and partied with a few of my friends. Fluke was at the forefront of my thoughts the entire night, however, and I had a really fun time that night.<br /><br />That's my blog entry for today. I hope you all enjoyed reading it and I hope you all have a fantastic day.<br /><br />regards,<br />The Truth<br /></span>"

Seeing at how I'm at Starbucks, I suppose i'll keep this blog short, with a much more detailed one to come shortly.<br /><br />I'm now living in Waterloo, and I'm a basketball coach in the Waterloo Youth Basketball Association. I coach in the Juvenile division, and my team consists of 16 and 17-year old boys. They all know how to play, and it's great. I'm running my first practice tonight at 8pm, which is at Ressurection High School. My team lacks size, but every single one of my players can shoot the ball, handle it, and they're surprisingly proficient at grabbing rebounds.<br /><br />I'll go into more detail in my next blog, as I'm pretty busy today. My next game is Thursday night at 6pm at Ressurection. Anyone of my friends in the Waterloo area is free to attend the game.<br /><br />Have a great day everyone.<br /><br />-coach Paul C.<br /><br /><br /></span><br />"

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium"">Hey folks, thanks for once again reading my blog. I have a few things I am going to cover in this one, so let's get on with it.<br /><br />Yeah, I am attention seeker. Nobody in Timmins should be surprised by this. When you hang out with people maybe once a week (if you're lucky) you tend to want attention. It's human nature. What do you expect me to do? Just sit here on my laptop all day and night and just be okay with being alone?&nbsp;Well I can't do that. I'm a very social person, and I love being around good people. College changed that for me. When I went, I was lucky to have one night a week to just have some alone time. At times,&nbsp;I had to ignore my friends just so I could be alone and have a &quot;me night.&quot; I was actually around people who didn't always look for something to fault me for.<br /><br />Up here in Timmins, I notice that a lot.&nbsp;Be it a high school thing or somebody hearing something about me, I just find that people spend more time trying to find ways NOT to like me rather than actually getting to know who I am. My own friends are guilty of that. My proof lies in the fact that back in high school, I was really messed up. Yet I still had plans with friends pretty much every week-end. I've matured since then, and yet now, I've been reduced to &quot;day time hang out if I can't find someone else to chill with.&quot; Like what the fuck?<br /><br />My friends up here almost seem disappointed that I've gotten better. I guess they miss being able to rag on me for my inability to get a girl or whatever. I don't know what more you people want from me. I know I'm not perfect, so understand that.<br /><br />There is a reason why people constantly wanted to be around me in college. I didn't change completely when I went away for school, I just was able to open up more and people were receptive to it. Of course I'm going to want attention when you go from THAT to&nbsp;THIS.&nbsp;And yet you're surprised by all this? Well you shouldn't be. It shouldn't be odd that&nbsp;I want to hang out with my friends that&nbsp;I had back in high school (Jay, Rachel...ect.). I really don't get it. Rachel and I chilled a few times a week from October through December. She would actually call me to go hang out. Now, I would be shocked if I heard from her.<br /><br />Jay is the same way. I'm shocked when he asks me to hang out. Usually, it's me saying something like &quot;Yo, I got weed, wanna chill?&quot; Well of course he'll want to. Free weed, he won't say no to that. It's pathetic yet I do it because it's either that or I'm home doing fuck all.<br /><br />I just find it pretty fucking ridiculous when people up here are shocked that&nbsp;I want to hang out with them or something. I'm not a damn serial killer or rapist or anything. Yet people look at me that way for some reason. Pardon me for dressing nice and being upbeat and wanting to chill and have fun. I'm human and I'm very social, so it should come as no surprise.<br /><br />Look, I know I talk a lot up here. I've never felt fully accepted by my friends so that constant chatter is my way of trying to prove myself. To show that&nbsp;I&nbsp;AM as a good friend as anyone else you know. I was like that in Windsor for about a month, until I finally realized that my friends there&nbsp;accepted me and genuinely wanted to be around me. It wasn't because I had weed or because&nbsp;I knew a guy who could get weed. No, it was because they liked who&nbsp;I was and what I was about.<br /><br />Yeah, people up here may say something like &quot;They didn't know him in high school&quot; or &quot;They don't know him like we do.&quot; Well, I graduated high school 3 years ago. I've changed a lot since then. What people up here knew about me, they knew who I&nbsp;WAS, not who I AM.<br /><br /></span><font size=""4"">It's easy to judge someone when you don't take the time to get to know them, and instead go off what other people say or how they look. I don't expect to have plans every single day, or for people to always call me 24/7 wanting to hang out. My life has never been normal, which you all know. But having an actual social life brings a sense of normalcy to my life that&nbsp;I really enjoy. Like it or not, your life is shaped by the people around you. So obviously I was much happier and upbeat in Windsor (where I went to college) because I was accepted and people wanted to be around me. It's positive vibes. When people want to be around you, naturally, it makes you feel good because you know people care.<br /><br />I start my new job on Monday, and for once,&nbsp;I want to meet some new friends at work. Hopefully, i'll&nbsp;have some old friends (such as Rachel) want to hang out with me again and finally accept that&nbsp;I'm not the same person I was in high school; that I'm much better than I was. I don't expect everyone to like me, but getting an active social life again would be great.<br /><br /></font><font size=""4"">Really, I'm hoping that&nbsp;my friends from here start treating me like an actual friend instead of just an obligation or a weed hook up. It shouldn't surprise you (this entire blog) yet some people will be surprised by it. The people who understand this blog will either be intelligent and unbiased, or people who actually ARE&nbsp;my friend and treat me as such.<br /><br />I know that I'm not perfect company. Everyone has flaws. But are mine so bad that&nbsp;I don't deserve to have a regular social life?* Of course not. I want to get better as a person, and I will. It doesn't happen overnight.<br /><br />Women up here are pretty ridiculous. Any time I even so much as glance at one, they give me the evil eye. Ladies, understand this: not every guy who checks you out wants to fuck you. The sooner you understand that, the better off you'll be. Do you ever think that hey, a guy is checking you out because he thinks you're cute? Or because he's a naturally friendly person? And I don't overdo it. It's usually just a quick glance and a smile that maybe last 2 seconds, tops. And yet there's something wrong with that? Wow.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and have a great night.<br /><br />-Paul<br /><br />* = if you answered yes to that question, then you shouldn't have bothered reading this.</font>"

"event","<span style=""font-size: medium"">Good morning people. I hope you're enjoying the nice snow fall (here in Timmins, at least). It's spring, there should be no more snow! Oh well, hopefully it gets nicer later on today.<br /></span><br /><span style=""font-size: medium"">Yesterday was a pretty awesome day. I went into my new work place (called On-Line Support) and filled out some paperwork, which took about 5 minutes. I found out that i'll be starting on Monday, and that Rachel will be in my training class, which is cool. We haven't hung out in awhile, so I hope we actually get along in class. I guess that's her call.<br /><br />Afterwards, I went to Jay's and we chilled for the evening. We watched the Bulls-Celtics, and what a game that was. It went to triple overtime. The series is tied at 3-3. Of those 6 games, 4 have gone into overtime, which is an NBA&nbsp;record for ANY&nbsp;round in the play offs.<br /><br />I was rooting for the Boston Celtics in&nbsp;this series, but after Rajon Rondo's cheap shot on Brad Miller in Game 5 (which he should have been suspended for, but wasn't, for whatever reason) I switched sides. The game was as intense and physical as Whitehead and I expected it to be. Kirk Hinrich, wow! He was ready to fight Rajon Rondo after Rondo grabbed him and threw him into the scorer's table. Of course, Rondo wasn't ejected. What more do the officials want before they'll finally eject Rondo from a game? It just seems fishy to me.<br /><br />I came away thoroughly impressed with Bulls center Joakim Noah, a guy I love to hate.&nbsp;He played really well and had a sick fast break dunk in which Paul Pierce fouled him (his 6th and final foul of the game).<br /><br />Kirk Hinrich and Brad Miller (of the Bulls) are two players I gained a TON&nbsp;of respect for after last night's game. I had always liked Hinrich, and was so-so on Brad Miller. I was just blown away at the way Hinrich played. Plus his near-fight with Rondo was great. He was ready to knock him out after Rondo tossed him into the scorers table. Brad Miller just played great. You talk about redemption, Miller just took it to the Celtics. His clutch 3-pointer late in the 4th quarter was fantastic.<br /><br />The Houston Rockets finally made it out of&nbsp;the first round for the first time since 1997. Of course, it was without the injured Tracy McGrady, who can finally tell people he made it to the second round for the first time in his career. I still believe that McGrady should be given a Ewing Theory award. It's his destiny to win one, and this series locked up that award for him.<br /><br />Well, I am going to enjoy this day. I have a few things planned, so I'm looking forward to having a great day. You people do the same.<br /><br />Take care everyone.<br /><br />-Paul<br /></span>"

"event","<p><span style=""font-size: medium"">I have returned! Yes, it's been almost 3 months since my last blog entry, and for that, I apologize. I appreciate the comments on my last blog, even though I have no idea who wrote them. I'm pretty sure the first one was from Nick, but the rest, I'm not sure.&nbsp;Whoever it was, I really appreciate it.<br /><br />One of the reasons I haven't posted in awhile is because I forgot my password. I tried the &quot;forgot password&quot; tool, which wasn't of much use to me, as this blog is registered under an old e-mail address of mine. Seeing as how I change my e-mail address more often than I talk about basketball, well, I guess you can see why the mishap occurred.<br /><br />I guess i'll mention the women, as I always tend to do in my blogs. I&nbsp;re-read my previous entry a few minutes ago and I feel bad about it. It's pretty ridiculous to group every woman up here with a few bad apples. Well, few is an understatement, but you get my point. blah blah blah, whatever.<br /><br />The NBA Play Offs are in full swing, and I couldn't be happier. My San Antonio Spurs trail the Dallas Mavericks 2-1 in their first round match up. Game 4 is tonight in Dallas. San Antonio is coming off an embarrassing 21 point loss in Game 3. Am I worried? Nope. The Mavs will choke (again) and the Spurs don't lose in the first round. Easy enough, I suppose.<br /><br />Next month is when I finally go to Ottawa to visit Nick. I'll be going for about a week, so it should be fun. I guess i'll just add this sentence so that this paragraph actually looks like a paragraph.<br /><br />I'm a little over a month away from going to see Dr. Hardy about my knees. June 2nd is basically what&nbsp;I've referred to as &quot;D-Day.&quot; Decision day. I'll find out whether I need surgery, medication, or physio to help get my knees back to 100%, if it's even possible. I want to be able to get back out there and play basketball at full strength. I haven't played since November, which is driving me nuts. I'm determined to get into great shape this summer and increase my vert, speed, and quickness. Why? Because I love the game of basketball.<br /><br />I've recently become hooked on the new craze that is Twitter. It's pretty neat and it's nice to see athletes and celebrities get PROPERLY quoted, for once.<br /><br />That's all&nbsp;I feel like saying for now. I'll churn out blogs more frequently from now on, however.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and have a great day.<br /><br />-Paul</span></p>"

Today has been pretty fun. I am indeed in the holiday spirit. I finally got an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon regarding my knees. On February 6th, 2009, I will find out whether I need surgery or not.

Next week, I will type my year in review blog. I hope you all enjoy it. As of now, I don't have any plans for New Year's eve, which isn't surprising. I've only ever gone out for New Year's on one occasion, and that was 3 years ago, when I went to Johnny Power's house for a party with guys on the Jr. Boys basketball team from my high school, TH&VS. Of course, some girls were there too, but of course, I didn't do anything with them.

Have a great one.

"event","Hey folks. I'm going to make this quick. This will be my last blog for awhile. Not many people read them, so that's one reason. But the main reason is that my life isn't that interesting right now. Until I get a girlfriend or a coaching gig in basketball, I'm done with blogging.

I've been really out of sorts lately as well. Depression is probably the best word to describe it. I'm figuring some things out in my life and making some personal changes, like with friends and stuff. 

Also, for the past year, I've not had a girlfriend and not been a part of basketball. It's like taking away my soul. That fire that once burned within me has burnt out. I hope it'll be re-ignited soon, with positive things to show for it next time.

May you all lead happy lives.

Right now, I'm pretty blitzed. For all you non-weed smokers, I'm high because I smoked a fair amount of marijuana. I went to Rachel's earlier and scooped 4 grams, and her, Brody, Sarah and myself chilled for a bit. It was only Rachel, Brody and I who smoked up, as Sarah was quite tired.

After chilling for a bit, Rachel had to go to Jen's and Brody had hockey. I met my parents at the theater and we watched Saw V. It was amazing. I thought the fifth version of the movie would be the finale, but according to Nick, there are going to be at least three more. I'll be quite pleased if there are.

I'll keep this blog short, I suppose. I'm going to watch a movie, eat, and perhaps blaze some more a little later. Gaming is definitely in my plans as well.

"event","In today's blog, I will be doing part one of my NBA season preview. I will do one team each day. The idea came to me via the Irishman, Nick Slywchuk. Yes, I know you're Ukranian, but dammit, you look Irish, LOL!

Though I am not a fan of them, my first NBA team preview will be Canada's team, the Toronto Raptors.

Projected starters:

PG - Jose Calderon
SG - Anthony Parker
SF - Jason Kapono
PF - Chris Bosh
C - Jermaine O'Neal

On paper, the Raptors have a middle of the pack team, at best. Yes, they have one of the best PG's  in the NBA in Jose Calderon, and one of the most formidable front courts led by All-Star's Chris Bosh and Jermaine O'Neal. Jason Kapono is one of the NBA's top 3 point shooters. Playing alongside Bosh and Jermaine O'Neal should give Kapono wide open shots all day long. 

The addition of Jermaine O'Neal was viewed as a major coup by Raptors fans. However, I am one of the biggest critics of this trade. They gave up T.J. Ford AND 1st Round Pick Roy Hibbert (along with Rasho Nesterovic). Hibbert, as you may be aware of, was one of the top centers in college basketball the last 3 years. He is massive, standing 7'2 and weighing 270 pounds. He also has soft hands around the basket and is surprisingly mobile for man of his size. He has enormous potential. Pardon the pun.

Jermaine O'Neal, when healthy, was one of the NBA's top power forwards. A few years ago, I likened him to a poor man's Kevin Garnett, and most people agreed that it was a fair assessment. However, he has been injury plagued for the past 3 seasons, playing in less than 100 games during that span. Also, he has displayed a very questionable attitude during that same time frame. When you're making $20m per season, expect to shoulder a ton of expectations and expect to be the leader of your team. Don't go crying to the media about how you don't want to be the leader, that it's not up to you to lead your team. If you don't want to shoulder such massive expectations, don't sign a $20m contract. If he was making $5m per year, no one would say a thing.

The downfall of the Raptors is their severe lack of depth. Backing up Calderon at PG will be rookie Roko Leni Ukic from Croatia, and Will Soloman, an American who has not played in the NBA since 2000. Being the MVP of the Euroleague is no guarantee of success in the NBA. Remember, Maurice Evans and Sarunas Jasikevicius were Euroleague MVP's, and neither was a starter in the NBA (Evans is now a reserve for the Atlanta Hawks).

Backing up Jason Kapono at SF will be last year's rookie sensation, Jamario (insert nickname here) Moon. He was absolutely fantastic to watch last season, I have to admit. Very few players can jump as high as Moon, and he was an absolute terror on transition defense, averaging 1.4 BPG . Pretty impressive for a guy no one heard of coming into training camp last year.

El Mago, Andrea Bargnani, will be Chris Bosh's back up at PF this year. After a fairly impressive rookie campaign, Bargnani hit a wall last season, seeing his numbers drop in every major offensive category. It remains to be seen if Bargnani can live up to the expectations of being the #1 overall pick, as he was in the 2006 NBA Draft.

Seeing as how I have to get ready to go out, I'm going to cut this short.

Prediction: 47-35, 2nd Round of NBA play offs.

Have a great day everyone.

A few weeks ago, I went to Rachel's before work to smoke up. It was supposed to be just us getting blitzed then my heading off to work. Well, we did just that, but when I got to work, I was so blitzed that I wound up going back to Rachel's, hahaha! There was no way I was going to make it through my shift. Upon arriving back at her place, we watched a movie with Brody and Zach, we smoked up some more, then I went home and talked to Nick for a few hours. Irishman seemed to get a kick out of the fact that I was so blitzed. Good times.

Breanna and I went to see Eagle Eye last night. That movie is amazing and I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes action/drama movies. Which reminds me, I have to pick up Iron Man today on DVD.

Normally I would be excited about the fact that NBA Live 09 is coming out this month, but I'm not. After playing NBA 2K8 at Jay's a few days ago, I'm going with the 2K series from now on.

If I wasn't so hungry, I would type more. For now, i'll head to No Frills and buy some food. I'm hungry for Chinese food, hahaha! Lucky Star doesn't open for another few hours though, so that's out of the question.

Have a splendid day everybody.

I can't explain why.<br /><br />Work last night was pretty cool. I must have been out of it because when I saw Jay, I did a double take. I know he works at the same place I do, and I usually see him before work, but still. He came by with one of his friends at around 1am. He looked pretty blazed, but he also may have been tired. Okay, I'm lying about that last part. Nonetheless, it was cool to see him.<br /><br />Hopefully this Friday, i'll be getting an X Box 360. I'll find out in 2 days. If you ask&nbsp;Nick, he'll tell you it's been driving me insane, haha! If I am able to get it, the only game I'm buying for now is College Hoops 2K8. Yes,&nbsp;I am aware of the fact that 2K9 comes out on November 7th, but frankly, I don't care. I have to wean myself on to the 2K series for basketball and College Hoops 2K8 should help. When 2K9 comes out, i'll be better prepared for it. Call me crazy, but I may be the only person who buys this game that is most looking forward to the recruiting aspect of it. Yeah, I've played NCAA&nbsp;Football 07, and it was neat, but an NCAA basketball game should be far more interesting.<br /><br />Now that I'm finished rambling on, I shall go.<br /><br />Have a great night everyone.<br /><br />-Paul A.

I went to bed at around 11am yesterday morning, and I didn't get up until about 3am this morning. I had a lot of sleep to catch up on. My dreams during that massive sleep period were pretty odd (one included my almost being eaten by a bear, thanks to Jay and Junior) but thankfully, it was just a dream.<br /><br />On Saturday, I am attending a coaching clinic from 11am-3pm. Hopefully by then, i'll find out which team I am coaching this fall in the Timmins Selects basketball program. My friend Jay also expressed interest in being on my coaching staff, so that's pretty awesome. Jay and I coaching together would be tremendous. My goal is to win the provincial championship this year, and having Jay as an assistant would be a huge bonus.<br /><br />A year and a half ago, I lost two amazing girls from my life. Well, I'm happy to say that one of them came back. My friend Witney is finally back in my life. It happened when I was checking out my old myspace page and browsing through my old messages (about a week ago). I saw a few messages that her and I had exchanged, so&nbsp;I decided to message her, to see if she remembered me. As it turns out, she did. We've been catching up ever since. I missed you Witneysweet, I'm so thankful that you're back. You have no idea how much it means to me.<br /><br />Work has been going good.

This was the first blog I ever typed. Enjoy!<br /></b></font></p><p><font size=""3""><b><br /></b></font></p><p><font size=""3""><b>Hey. This is a blog, yes.&nbsp; Posted on December 16th, 2005, not '06 as it indicates.</b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>Well, my trip to Moncton, New Brunswick for basketball was the best. We went to an all-you-can-eat Chinese Buffet on our first night there. </b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>The day before, we drove to Toronto from my hometown of Timmins. We caught a Raptors game that night(November 28th), and it was the best night of my life. Our seats were awesome. We saw the Blue Man Group perform at halftime. Since our team got tickets from a scalper, we were pretty spaced out(2 guys per group). Me and Shane were in row 27 behind the nets(by the Raptors bench) so it was great. When I first saw the Raptors dancers, I dropped my camera, LOL. </b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>At halftime, while the Blue Man Group played, me and Shane moved closer to a few empty seats next to a few of the other boys on the team. The Raptors are my favourite pro sports franchise in any sport, so when I first walked into the arena and saw the Raptors, I was exhilerated. It was my first Raptors game. </b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>We flew out the next morning from Pearson Airport. I had to take off my shoes at airport security(my Lugz) and since I was the only guy to have to do so, the boys on the team didn't let me hear the end of it for awhile. </b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>The flight was nice. We took a Boeing 737. I had a ""window seat"" with no window. I was very disappointed, but I got a peek outside from the seat ahead of me. It was about a 2 hour flight.</b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>When we arrived in Moncton, I was in awe of how beautiful the city was. It's somewhat similar to my hometown of Timmins, only bigger and more spread out. Because of it's resemblance to Timmins, I never once felt out of place or lost there. I always felt at home, which put my mind at ease. </b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>We went to a place called Magnetic Hill a few days into our trip. It's a place where as you go ""down"" the hill, you're feeling an upward force, and vice-versa. At the bottom of the hill, my coach put our rental van(one of 2; assistant coach Big Rob drove the other) in neutral and we began to accelerate the further up the hill we got. Everyone then got out and walked up and down the hill. There's even a stream that runs upward alongside the hill. It's a sight to behold, a once in a lifetime experience that I feel very priveleged to have experienced, and i'll never forget it. </b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>The people in Moncton are very friendly. I was surprised at their hospitality. I've never been to a city where everyone was this friendly. </b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>We finished 4th in the tournament. </b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>Me and the boys had the time of our life there. On our last night, me and a few of the guys went to this indoor amusement park across the road from the hotel. We got a ""day pass"" at night and rode every ride; we went on the roller coaster like, 10x, LOL. Plus we played laser tag.</b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>Afterwards, a guy on the team(Justin) picked up 2 girls and we all went to see a movie. We saw Get Rich Or Die Tryin'. It was a really good movie. Then again, I tend to say that about EVERY movie, because I really get into them. The only movie I never liked was ""50 First Dates"". It was funny and deep, but it lacked a true concept. </b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>The next morning, as I went outside with my bags packed, I began to feel sad that early Sunday morning. I was really going to miss Moncton. This was the first time that I was going to miss a city after a basketball trip. I had been gone for a week and really missed my dogs, but I still didn't want to leave. I have a special bond with dogs, and it's great. I love dogs more than life itself. They're the greatest animals. </b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>The flight back to Toronto was well, interesting. In the Moncton Airport, I decided to wear my Nike basketball shoes, to avoid the security hassle I dealt with in Toronto regarding my Lugz. I bought my parents mugs as souvenirs at the airport. Shirts were really expensive, so....</b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>Because the flight was underbooked, we were allowed to move around to get our own seats. So all but 2 of the guys did. Like many, I had my own row, which was nice, because I got to stretch out across the 3 seats in the row after we were safely in the air. Which means I got to sleep. Since our flight was early in the morning, everyone else did the same, except for the 2 who didn't move seats, Shane and Adam. For some reason, I felt nauseus on the flight, almost to the point of throwing up. I can't explain why. </b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>When we landed in Toronto, I felt somewhat happy to be back in my home province of Ontario. As we walked to the luggage claim, we saw 2 foreign guys get arrested and brought into Canadian Immigration. It was kind of funny. At the luggage claim, it was funny, because one of my shirts had fallen out of my schoolbag which was circulating on the machine. That was quite interesting and the guys got a good laugh out of it.</b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>The drive back to Timmins took about 8 hours. It was great to be home.</b></font></p> <p><font size=""3""><b>Well, that's the blog about my trip, feel free to leave a comment or 2.</b></font></p>"

However, my mind is focused on returning to school in 2009. I'm trying to avoid becoming good friends with anyone I work with, because I would miss them next year, but no matter where I go for lunch and breaks, at least two people come to sit and talk with me. I go and sit outside away from the building and they still come and chat. Nice people though.<br /><br />There is a coaching clinic I have to attend on September 13th, which will officially register me as a coach for the Timmins Selects Basketball program. If the program doesn't run all winter, then I'm going to talk to my high school basketball coach about being an assistant coach on the Timmins High Blues Sr. Boys basketball team this winter. It'd only be for one season, but oh well. That would just add to my coaching resume, and help my chances of coaching down south next year when I go to university.<br /><br />I'm doing alright in my life right now. I just really miss my friends from Windsor. Talking to them on MSN is one thing, but being around them is much better. Other than that, I'm happy with how my life is.<br /><br />For Spring Break next year, I was thinking about going to Cancun, Mexico or the Caribbean. However, Rashad thought it would be cool if I went to visit him at his university, Ole Miss, which is in Mississippi. I may just do that. Mind you, if I beat him in a game of 1-on-1, which is possible, i'll never let him live it down. If I dunk on him, I swear that will rival Baron Davis's dunk on Andrei Kirilenko in the 2007 NBA play offs as one of the sickest dunks ever.<br /><br />I do hope you have enjoyed this piece of literature, do you have yourself a fantastic day.<br /><br />-Paulus<br /></font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Good afternoon folks. I have a simple request from my readers, if you don't mind. After reading this blog, please leave a quick comment, just so I have an idea of how many people read my blogs. I really appreciate it.<br /><br />I recently spoke to my high school basketball coach about coaching in the Timmins Selects Basketball program this fall. As many of you know, I applied for a coaching position a few months ago. I also spoke to the league's president, Laurent Gilbert. They both assured me that I've been accepted as a coach this fall, which is awesome. I'm not sure which age group i'll be coaching, but my preference would be boys, ages 15-17. Coach Sok (my high school basketball coach) is the one who decides which team each coach is assigned to, so I'm hoping he will put me with a solid team, just to see what I can do. He has seen my system, and he likes it a lot, so I'm sure he's looking forward to seeing how effective it will be. He taught me a lot about basketball and how to run a team, so I'm excited that I finally get a chance to show him what I learned in my 2 years with his team.<br /><br />My goal is to make it to provincials this year, which I believe is an attainable goal. Once I get there, my goal is to win every game. Many people (Nick, I know you're reading this) don't think that's possible, but I will never coach a game in which I don't believe my team can win. Any coach who has that mindset entering a game should not be on the sidelines. Basketball, ultimately, is about having fun. When you win, you have fun. Simple.<br /><br />It would be nice to coach against Nick at some point this year. Irishman has this idea that his team is going to run mine off the court, based strictly on talent and athleticism. By the same token, the United States men's basketball team should have done the same to Greece in the 2006 World Championships, but we all know what happened there, haha! It would be a fun game, that's for sure.<br /><br />Canada is to the Summer Olympics as Iceland is to hockey. If only bowling was an Olympic sport (which it should be, seriously) we might actually win a medal. For all you basketball fans, be sure to thank national team head coach Leo Rautins for the absence of Steve Nash, Samuel Dalembert, and Jamaal Magloire from our men's national basketball team this year. If they didn't despise Rautins so much, Canada's men's basketball team would not only make it to the Olympics, but they would have a good chance at winning a medal. Chuck Swirsky moved south of the border, why can't Rautins?<br /><br />That's all for today, I suppose. I'm attempting to locate the first blog I ever typed, which was completed way back in December 2005. If I can find it, I will post it on here, just for fun.<br /><br />Remember to leave a quick comment so that I have an idea of how many people read my blogs.<br /><br />Have an amazing day everyone.<br /><br />-Paul</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Hello all. Yes, it's been about a month since I last updated my blog, and for that, I do apologize. I've been quite busy and also, quite sick.<br /><br />A few weeks ago, I got strep throat for the first time in my life. It was not a fun time, to say the least. The worst part of it lasted for about 5 days, and I lost 10 pounds during that time. I'm feeling much better now, which is great.<br /><br />Three days ago, I sprained my left wrist and left ankle while roller blading. I was on my way back from the store and as I was getting near my house, I hit a divot in the road and fell hard to the ground. The roads up here in Timmins are horrendous, so I kind of expected it to happen at one point or another.<br /><br />My summer has been going pretty well. Hopefully sometime this month i'll hear back from the Timmins Selects basketball program. I'm awaiting to see whether I was accepted as a coach for the inaugural season. Basketball is probably my biggest passion in life, and coaching it on a regular basis would make me one of the happiest people on the planet. It's not my whole life, but when I'm passionate about something, I put my heart and soul into it.<br /><br />I'm going to keep this blog rather short. I'm going to purchase some DVD's today and perhaps take a swim, which I've not done in over a year, surprisingly.<br /><br />Have a fantastic day everybody, and remember to always follow your bliss.</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Today is the day of the 2008 NBA Draft! As you can tell, I am quite excited. Okay, that's an understatement, but whatever. Starting at around 7pm, I will be doing my 3rd annual NBA Draft Blog. <br /><br />For those of you unfamiliar with my NBA Draft Blogs, well, it's essentially a running diary of the events that unfold during the NBA Draft, plus some things that are going on around me (such as people I am speaking with). I should be joined (via MSN) by my buddy and partner in crime, Nicholas Slywchuk. Mind you, Nick and I have never committed a crime, but if the Utah Jazz happen to draft someone from China, well let's just say, all bets are off. <br /><br />The Jazz happen to be Nick's favorite team. I applaud Nick, really. I mean, who wouldn't love a team that is located in a state where the only black people in the state happen to play for the Utah Jazz? I am aware of the fact that the state of Utah has a pair of good universities for men's basketball (Brigham Young and the University of Utah) but the last 2 NBA players they have produced are Utah alumnus Andrew Bogut and (soon to be draftee) Trent Plaisted of Brigham Young. They are the whitest of white guys.<br /><br />I understand that those last two jokes seem racially motivated. Keep in mind, I'm poking fun at white people, not black people. I am white so I'm allowed to do that. It's like when you hear rappers such as Ice Cube and 50 Cent use the ""N"" word to describe their friends and family. Technically it's a racist term, but they are not using it in that manner (except when they talk about somebody they don't like). This is not the case here, as I like Utah and therefore, am not ripping them on a personal level. Just thought i'd clear that up.<br /><br />This year, I will actually be watching the NBA Draft on T.V. so my blog (or ""running diary"") should be much more entertaining and informative this year. I am trying to prepare about 5,552 jokes that involve Stuart Scott, Dick Vitale, and Stephen A. Smith, three men who will be analyzing the draft live as it occurs. Stu Scott and Stephen A. Smith will be at the draft, which is taking place at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Dick Vitale will be analyzing the draft from his secret lair, some 80 miles underneath the earth's surface. Oh, and of course, my favorite draft analyst, Jay Bilas, should also be there. I won't even get started with him. Screw it. This man ranks intangibles. Keep in mind, intangibles are the great unknown, and yet Bilas RANKS them! Just thought i'd prepare you for tonight.<br /><br />I hope that two of my other friends, Jay Whitehead and Joe ""Gangsta"" Bwanka, decide to stay on MSN during the draft. I'm trying to see if Jay wants to hang out during the draft, which would make my running draft diary about 10x better, but we'll have to see.<br /><br />There have been a few trades consummated that will affect the draft, but I will talk more about them tonight, when my running diary begins, which will be approximately around 7pm ET.<br /><br />Until then, enjoy your day folks!<br /><br />-Paul</font>"

I've read that blog a few times and the more I read it, the more I think ""Wow, that doesn't really reflect my view on life."" I may delete it, because looking back on it, I didn't mean half of what I said. Perhaps I should have posted a blog when I was in a better mood.</font><br /><br /><font size=""4"">Well, this is not going to be one of my typical blogs. Uh uh, nope. Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be my 2008 NBA Mock Draft! Keep in mind, I only do a mock draft for the 1st Round, because it's much easier to gauge, and some teams tend to pick Euros in the 2nd Round of the draft that I have never even heard of, so screw it.

I've been in contact with the editor of a major basketball website, which is www.nbadraft.net. It's a site frequented by NBA general managers, NBA players, and NBA coaches and scouts. Also, many NCAA players and coaches frequent that website. My point is, I asked the editor if I can do an NBA Draft blog for the site. I've done an NBA Draft blog for the past 2 years. It's a running diary of the NBA Draft, pretty much. The editor wants me to e-mail him a copy of my 2007 NBA Draft blog, so that he can determine whether I'm good enough to write one for the 2008 NBA Draft. Regardless, I'm going to do a draft blog, but if I can get it posted on that website, it will be great.<br /><br />Have a great night everyone!<br /><br />-Paul</font></font></font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Hey, a blog so soon? Yes indeed! From September 2007 to October 2007, I used to churn out blogs every few days. I may start doing so again, seeing as how I was pretty happy in my life at that time.<br /><br />It's a different story now. Sarah didn't pick me. Whoever reads this (i.e. Nick) is probably thinking ""Ah well, he should be used to it by now."" Well, I'm not used to it. Frankly, it hurts. Every fucking time I take that big step and re-open my heart to a girl, thinking ""Hey, it might be worth it this time"" it turns out to be another load of crap. Sarah is still a great girl, make no mistake about it, but this hurts. She is back with her ex-boyfriend.<br /><br />Here's the thing; every fucking time I think I get it right, something fucks it up. Not to toot my own horn here, but I'm a very intelligent guy, I'm quite handsome, I have a huge heart, I have a great personality and I am the last person on the face of the earth who would ever cheat on a femme. Is that good enough? Of course not. As everyone knows, I have high standards, but so what? It's better that than settling for some fat beast who smokes and who has a lousy attitude and who is as dumb as a bag of hammers.<br /><br />A few of my (moronic) friends have said that I should ""take what I can get."" Well that doesn't fly with me. Also, of the girls I have been with, I only regretted being with one. I'm fairly certain you all know who she is. Of all the friends I have who are dating/engaged/married, there is not one of them who I have thought ""he/she can do better."" They are with the best person they can be with, and I know that they want me to be with the best girl for me, one who makes me extremely happy.<br /><br />I really am beginning to question the whole point of meeting someone and then seeing if there is anything there for a relationship. I've heard from a few girls this year that I'm a great guy who is handsome and that I deserve a great girl. These are the same girls who wind up getting with another fucking guy a few weeks later. Way to fucking use me as an ego boost.<br /><br />The girls I've met in the past year, well, in a way, they did use me. Not for money, but on an emotional level. Starting with Myrissa last September, each girl I've become close with has used me as a gauge of their sense of self-worth, then some other guy reaps the rewards. I've made them realize that they are human beings who should be treated in a respectful manner and that they deserve a great guy. Each time, I was that guy! Instead, it was like ""Okay, now that I know this, see ya."" Like fuck you! I would never do that to any girl, and yet each of those fucking femmes deemed it okay to pull that shit with me. If I ever did that, my own friends would look down on me.<br /><br />The girls I've met in the past few years, well, I've noticed a trend. They view my passion as ""creepy"" or ""disturbing."" Like what the fuck? I have a passion for reading, writing, drawing up basketball plays, and for basketball in general. They in no way border on obsessive, yet I still get looked down on for that, which is fucking stupid. Don't women want a guy who is passionate about at least ONE thing?<br /><br />When I display a calm, relaxed demeanor, again, it's viewed as creepy or disturbing. Well pardon me for not being fucking wired 24/7. It's called SELF-CONFIDENCE! I don't have to go 110% in every aspect of life just to prove that I actually am worthy of being with you.<br /><br />The other aspect that I don't fucking get is why femmes are disturbed by my level of intelligence. It's kind of like ""Oh my God, how does he know these things? That's weird."" Umm, maybe it's because I read a lot and I DO have an education. And it's not like the knowledge I possess is out of the ordinary. I don't claim to be a genius.<br /><br />I'm fucking fed up, really. Of all the girls I've ever been intimate with, none of them are a part of my life. Like what the hell?<br /><br />I've been criticized a few times for not hooking up with random girls this year. What good would that accomplish? I love affection, make no mistake about it, but it's pointless if it's with some femme i'll most likely never see again. It doesn't reflect well on the girl either. If she's willing to fool around the first time we meet, then who knows how many guys she's done that with?<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief, it's a lot harder to find a relationship than it is to go out and ""pick up."" It takes more skill, more dedication, more heart to fully commit to that special someone.<br /><br />I really don't believe that all of the heartache I've suffered in the past year will ever be worth it. I've had a few of my friends tell me that someday, all of that shit will be worth it. I used to believe that myself. Up until recently, I held a firm belief that someday, when I find my perfect girl, i'll say ""It was all worth it. Every single bit of it was worth it."" That's a load of crap. I can't possibly envision a scenario in which I finally find her and say ""Oh my God, it was all worth it, I can't believe it.""<br /><br />Really, I fail to see the point of pursuing a relationship and even putting in the effort once the opportunity presents itself. Even when I have no expectations, it still never pans out. That hurts each and every time. Yet I hear the same bullshit from my friends ""It's okay, you'll get over it."" Umm, fuck you all for ever saying that. Those same people who say it are the same people who are happily in a relationship. Don't give me that crap that ""I know how you feel"" because you really don't.<br /><br />Frankly, I want to forget the following words: love, relationship, marriage, engaged, fiancee, girlfriend, intimacy, intimate, cuddle, cuddling, sex, making love, romance, and holding hands. Anything related to relationships, I wish I could forget, so that I would stop getting hurt all the damn time.<br /><br />My life would be far better if I could only focus on my friends, my education, my interests in life, and (eventually) coaching men's basketball at the University of Texas at El Paso and winning multiple national championships. The day I win my first NCAA Championship as the head coach of the UTEP Miners men's basketball program is the day that my life will truly be complete.<br /><br />AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I'm done typing, see ya.<br /><br />-Paul</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Good day everyone. For the record, by ""everyone"" I mean the people who actually read my blog, not the whole world. I'm fairly certain that if everyone in the world was reading my blog, it'd be on the news and this website would crash. Just thought i'd clear that up.<br /><br />Warning: The following paragraph may bore you and sound repetitive. If you're not interested in hearing about the new girl I recently met, please skip this paragraph. Thank you.<br /><br />I recently met a girl named Sarah. She is from Windsor and she attends the University of Windsor. She is majoring in automotive engineering. I know I've said this about every girl I've met, but she is really beautiful and extremely intelligent. Sarah is different though, in a good way. She's into sports, which is cool. Yes, she is a New England Patriots fan, but she is forgiven because she also likes the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. For those of you who do not know who those teams are, well, they are football teams in the NFL. Why do I keep explaining these things? Sarah can also be forgiven for being a Detroit Red Wings fan. That's acceptable, as long as they are not playing my Anaheim Ducks, the Colorado Avalanche, the Vancouver Canucks, the Montreal Canadiens, and the Ottawa Senators. I'm going to stop naming teams before you readers start getting bored. What it comes down to is, I care about Sarah a lot, and she cares about me a lot, and I am hopeful that things will work out between her and I.<br /><br />note: if you read the preceding paragraph, well, don't say I didn't warn you. haha, just kidding :-) Sarah is unique, and a girl I can definitely see myself with someday.<br /><br />The NBA play offs are now in the finals. It's the Los Angeles Lakers v. the Boston Celtics. It should have been my San Antonio Spurs v. the Boston Celtics. I keep telling myself this. Brent Barry was clearly fouled on his buzzer beating shot at the end of Game 4. Of course, there was a non-call by none other than Joey Crawford, a.k.a. the Spurs Hater. Crawford is the same referee who was suspended indefinitely a year ago for giving Tim Duncan 2 technical fouls while he was on the bench in one game, causing Duncan to be ejected from the game. Duncan received those 2 technical fouls (in a span of less than a minute) for LAUGHING! Yes, he was laughing. <br /><br />Anyways, there is no way that Crawford should have been allowed to officiate any Spurs game, due to his clear bias against them. When Brent Barry was fouled on that final play, Joey Crawford was the closest official to the action. The NBA even said a few days later that that should have been called a foul. If that's the case, why not have the end of that game replayed, with Barry taking his 2 foul shots? The Spurs only lost by 2 points in that game. Barry was the best free throw shooter on the Spurs during the play offs. If the NBA had no intention of replaying the final few seconds, allowing Barry to take his foul shots (making both would have sent the game into overtime) why the hell did they come out and say that it should have been a foul? To torture Spurs fans everywhere? Yes, I am still bitter about the Spurs losing that series.<br /><br />At some point today, I am finally going to type up my NBA Mock Draft v. 1.0. If you're at all interested in checking it out, just message me on MSN. It's going to be based on what I think teams WILL do, not what I think they SHOULD do. Just wanted to make that clear.<br /><br />Admittedly, I've not been all that cheerful lately. I'm kind of depressed right now. I booked the next two days off work so that I can clear my head a little bit. I even took a walk a few nights ago to my special spot. I went for that walk around 2am. I used to take late night walks all the time, even in high school. Sometimes it was because I was in a great mood, other times was because I was not having a great day. Prior to a few nights ago, I had not taken one of my typical late night walks since last October. That's quite a long time, if you ask me.<br /><br />My friend Alyssa has said that any time I need to talk about anything, I can call her. I really do appreciate that. I talk for a long time whenever her and I are on the phone, and surprisingly, she is cool with it. She is one of a few friends who have been there for me lately, which is pretty awesome. I mean, that's what friends are for, of course, but my main thing about friendship is having great people to share your joy and happiness with. Yes, I'm aware of the fact that joy and happiness are one and the same, I just thought it would make the previous sentence a tad more appealing. I feel like you should know these things.<br /><br />I'm going to go shave and then perhaps watch a movie. I'll also get to work on my mock draft in a few hours.<br /><br />Have a great day everyone.<br /><br />-Paul<br /><br />P.S. just showing some love for Stacey, Sarah, Alyssa, Jay, and, what the hell, Jeff Van Gundy. He is the best color commentator in the history of sports.</font>"

I'm not going type a long one now, seeing as how I'm laying in bed and it's very uncomfortable to</font> <font size=""4"">type while laying on my side. I will type a much longer blog tomorrow to update you, my readers, on the past month. It's been a great month, that's for sure. Damaging my right wrist at the gym was not good, but ah well. I'm almost fully healed, heh!<br /><br />On April 28th, I attended a banquet at the Dante Club, and it was there that I met CFL Hall of Famers Damon Allen and Michael ""Pinball"" Clemons, along with singer Diane Clemons. Before I start detailing that night, well, i'll just leave it for tomorrow. It's going to be a long blog, so yeah. Suffice to say, it was one of the most inspirational nights of my entire life.<br /><br />I'm watching the Cavaliers-Celtics game right now, and at 10:30pm, the Los Angeles Lakers host the Utah Jazz, who happen to be the favorite team of my good friend Nick.<br /><br />Have a great night everyone!<br /><br />-Paul<br /></font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Hello readers. It's about time I updated my blog, I suppose. Right now, I'm at the library. I took my lunch rather early because I was bored, so yeah.<br /><br />About a week ago, I was involved in a car accident. I took a cab home from the gym and we slammed into the back of a truck. My right leg was hurt but it's perfectly fine now. A few people told me to sue the cab company, but that would have been stupid. I can walk and talk, so I'm good to go.<br /><br />The t-shirt and sweater that I ordered came in rather quickly. In case you haven't read, I ordered a University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP for short) t-shirt and sweater. The UTEP Miners are my favorite NCAA team and also, I hope to become the head coach of their men's basketball program someday. Winning a couple of NCAA Championships would be nice, that's for sure. This may sound crazy, but I would turn down head coaching offers from the top NCAA programs in the country (such as Duke, North Carolina, Kentucky.....wait, forget them, Tennessee, Memphis) just to coach at tiny UTEP. They last won an NCAA Championship in 1966.<br /><br />Admittedly, work has sucked as of late. The policy for Sprint is ridiculous. Not to mention the fact that where I work, high school rep. is the most important factor in determining your success (that and how many higher ups you're good friends with). Yeah, I'm good buddies with a few higher ups (such as Harry, who, even though he is a Leafs fan, is a pretty cool guy) but it's not enough. If Sprint gave more leeway to their customer care reps. in how they can deal with customers, work would be more fun and a lot less stressful. I'm not implying that we should be allowed to curse out customers, but you know.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />customer: ""Hey! My fucking bill is too goddamn high and I want to know why! Sprint also cut off my damn service! I pay about $150 a month on average and now my bill is over $400! I want you to find out why this is and then credit my account because this is bullshit! I want this fixed NOW! Also, turn on my phones right now!""<br /><br />customer care rep. does his/her research and finds that the customer has not paid their previous bill and also, that they have been late to pay their bill for each of the last 6 months.<br /><br />Sprint policy:<br /><br />customer care representative: ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience this may have caused you. I'm seeing here that you have a past due balance on your account which has caused the interruption in service. Let's see what we can do for you today.""<br /><br />How customer care representaives SHOULD be allowed to respond:<br /><br />customer care rep: ""Well sir/ma'am, maybe if you paid your bill on time every month, you wouldn't have this issue. Also, you made $259.84 worth of calls to Sweden, and I checked the account notation history and did not see any request to add an international calling plan. So until you pay your bill, your service is going to remain cut off.""<br /><br />It's direct, to the point, and the customer will actually understand these terms better.<br /><br />Recently, I met a girl named Jackie. No, NOT my sister, for all you morons out there. This girl is pretty sweet and quite beautiful. Apparently, she's now looking for a nice guy. She found one, hah! She's just a good friend and yeah, all girls do deserve a really nice guy.<br /><br />Anyways, I am very late. I felt the need to vent, so I did, and that's that.<br /><br />Have a great day everyone.<br /><br />-Paul</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Good afternoon everyone. It's quite a great day, if I do say so myself.<br /><br />Last night, I missed the Louisville-North Carolina game due to the fact that I fell asleep. Well, it was an extended nap. The game started at 9pm. I took a nap at 8pm, woke up for a few minutes at 9:30pm, then I woke up again at 5am. Surprisingly, Rashad was still online, which was cool. I arrived at the gym at 8:30am, and I didn't leave until a little after 1pm. My energy level was endless, it was great. Even when I decided to call it quits, I still had a lot of energy. The thing is, the NCAA Tournament is still ongoing, so yeah.<br /><br />Today, the #2 seed Texas Longhorns play the #1 seed Memphis Tigers (in the South bracket). The winner will advance to the Final Four to play the UCLA Bruins, who are my pick to win the entire tournament. At 5pm, Davidson plays Kansas. Rashad and I have a little bet going for this game. If Davidson wins, I have to buy him (and ship him) a hoodie or t-shirt of his favorite NCAA team. Which team that is, I'm not sure. If Kansas wins, he has to buy me and ship me a brand new basketball. It doesn't seem like much, but whatever. I already ordered a t-shirt and hoodie of my favorite NCAA team (and the team I hope to coach someday; their men's basketball team) so I'm good. For the record, that team is the University of Texas at El Paso. Or UTEP for short.<br /><br />Anyways, I am mighty hungry, so I'm out.<br /><br />Have a great day everyone.<br /><br />-Paul</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">It's March Madness baby, whoo!<br /><br />Yes, it is time for the NCAA Men's basketball tournament again. We're already in the Sweet 16, which is cool. My University of Texas at El Paso Miners missed the Big Dance, so I was disappointed. They lost in the second round of the NIT Tournament, which is essentially a tournament for the teams that were not good enough to play with the big boys.<br /><br />I ordered some UTEP gear this past Tuesday. A white sweater and a navy blue t-shirt bear the logo and name of my favorite NCAA team. Yes, they also happen to be the team I someday hope to coach (their men's basketball program) and lead them to multiple NCAA Championships.<br /><br />Work today was lame. I'm burnt out, pretty much. The people I work with, I can't say I'm too fond of them. A few have tried being nice to me, but for the most part, I want nothing to do with them. The thing about friendship up north is, it's tier-based. Friends aren't treated equally up here. I've known and experienced that for many years. In Windsor, friends are considered equals, which is the right way of going about it.<br /><br />Another reason why I push people away up here is that they are not my Windsor people. It's like trying to mix oil and water; it's impossible. Not a single person I've met here can even come close to matching how great my friends from down south are. My best friend Stacey (from Wasaga Beach) is far and away better than anybody I've ever met here. I have high standards when it comes to friends (and women) so settling for a group of people I think are ""okay"" is out of the question. People who settle are unhappy. That's not how I go about anything in life, and that's how i'll always approach everything in my life.<br /><br />Anyways, I'm going to make some food and watch some college basketball. Gus Johnson is one of the commentators for the Davidson-Wisconsin game, so it's great. He is the second best commentator ever (well, a tie for second, with Steve Kerr). For the record, I believe that Marv Albert is the best commentator ever. He could make a croquet match seem intense and exciting, I swear. He could have people on the edge of their seat during a game of darts. He's THAT good.<br /><br />Have a great night everyone.<br /><br />-Paul<br /><br />P.S.

I have a migraine headache, so that's why.<br /><br />The past week has been pretty neat. I've been reading a book I recently purchased from Coles Book Store. It's called ""On The Shoulders of Giants: My Journey Through The Harlem Renaissance"" by NBA Hall of Fame center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The book has very little to do with basketball and more to do with the history of African-Americans and their early struggles (plus about the history of Harlem). I've read only a few chapters thus far, but I am hooked. I really do love this book.<br /><br />That's all for my blog today, seeing as how my head is throbbing.<br /><br />signing off.....<br /><br />-Paul<br /><br />P.S. much love Stacey, you're the best friend anyone (especially me) could ever ask for.<br /></font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Well yesterday was a rather interesting day. I had a fun day at work and I had a great workout. However, the walk home was a different story. As I was crossing the street at one point (I had the right of way, as it was at a stop sign and I let one car go) another person tried to run me down. That's right. Somebody waited until I was close enough to their car and they floored it. I barely got out of the way. How I managed to get out of the way, I don't know. Of course, I lost it, daring the car to come back around and try it again. Instead, the person just drove away. <br /><br />You know how I tend to generalize the people of Timmins in a not so positive way? Well, that person lived up to it. If you're stupid enough to try something like that, at least have the cajones to drive around and try it again. Finish the job, if you're even capable of doing so. Had I hopped on the car, well, that person would have gone to jail. It would have looked like I had been hit. <br /><br />If your life is so fucking pathetic that you have to resort to trying to run somebody down with your car, then you really might want to re-think your priorities in life. Ask yourself this question: is it really worth spending 5-6 years in federal prison, getting ass raped on a daily basis, just to run somebody down just because you don't like them? You may be laughing and saying ""hahahaha, it fucking would be."" I don't think so. <br /><br />If you're willing to give up your freedom and go to prison for attempted murder (yeah, that's what you would be charged with) you really should see a shrink. Had I slipped on ice when I was running to avoid the car, no doubt i'd have been killed. My neck would have snapped. Then whoever did that would have faced life in prison. I have never thought too highly of Timmins folk (and with good reason) but that takes the cake. <br /><br />In Windsor last year, the few times when I didn't get along with some people, we stayed out of each other's way. Didn't say stupid shit, didn't even acknowledge each other's exsistence. We were content with our own lives so we didn't have to resort to stupid, immature antics to prove we didn't like each other. We knew we didn't like each other, accepted it, and moved on with our lives. Is that so hard Timmins folk? Why waste your energy on someone you want nothing to do with? ""Because I fucking hate that person"" is not a legit excuse. I get it, you people don't like me! Do I give a shit? Hah, I don't think so. I have the best friends anyone could ever ask for. Frankly, I'm glad none of them live up here. It wouldn't suit them.<br /><br />What it comes down to is, if you're truly content in your life and really love the things/people around you, you wouldn't have to spew all of your pain/negativity out on other people. That's what it comes down to. People who are truly happy try and spread their joy, not spew their hate.<br /><br />Paul<br /><br />&lt;3 Stacey, you're the best friend anyone could ever ask for.

"event","<font size=""4"">Hey people. It's been over a month since my last blog entry, and for that, I do apologize. I'll try and keep them more up to date from now on.<br /><br />The past month was an alright month. I turned 22 on 02/09 which was cool. I spent that day at work, which sucked. My best friend Stacey and my friend Stephanie were my Valentine's for this year. Valentine's Day 2009 will be the best one yet.<br /><br />I got in really good shape this month, which is great. I suffered a setback a week ago, when I started experiencing severe pain and swelling in my left ankle. I went to the hospital yesterday and as it turns out, I have inflammation in my left ankle. The doctor prescribed some anti-inflammatories. Also, he said I can't do any leg weights for 3-4 weeks. That's sure going to be fun.<br /><br />Just before my birthday, I bought a laptop. It's a Dell. I love it.<br /><br />I've come to the decision that all of the shit that happened in the past, I'm just going to forget about it. If I allow it to shape who I want to become, then i'll fuck myself over. When it comes to relationships, I won't fear getting hurt again. Fear of getting hurt will lead to getting hurt. For friendships, well, I'm going to forget the assholes of the past and focus on the great friends I have now and the great friends I will meet in the future. Being upset about the dickheads who were a part of my past will not help me at all. I met some awesome people last month, and they were great.<br /><br />I've continued writing my book, which I am having a blast with so far. I'm slowly but surely regaining my passion for writing. I've also decided to try and re-discover my love and passion for the game of basketball. Soon, I am going to start drawing up plays again which I believe is the key to unlocking my love for the game again. We shall see.<br /><br />Anyways, I'm off. Thanks for reading.<br /><br />-Paul<br /></font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Another blog, another odd opening. Let's get on with it.<br /><br />Not too much excitement has occurred in my life as of late, which is okay. Were I in Windsor right now, i'd have more than enough people to hang out with. I admit, I do miss being around my friends pretty much everyday. I work with a lot of people, sure, but most of them like to create drama and talk shit about people because they have nothing better to do. It would be nice to hang out with the people at work that I actually like, but it's their call, not mine.<br /><br />Yesterday, I bought ""Saw IV"" and ""Mr. Woodcock"" on DVD. I forgot how funny ""Mr. Woodcock"" is (I saw it in theatres when it first came out). Billy Bob Thornton is effin' hilarious. Seann William Scott was great in that movie as well. I've yet to watch ""Saw IV"" yet. I've just been watching the special features, which are neat. Upon completion of this blog, I will finally watch ""Saw IV."" When I saw it in theatres, it was amazing. Yet another horror movie that failed to make me feel uncomfortable. By most people's standards, it's a pretty gruesome movie. However, I tend to focus on the storyline and the concept of the movie, so the blood and guts and violence don't phase me. I suppose that could also be a subconscious thing as well. Even though the blood and guts and violence look real, subconsciously, my mind knows it's fake so I don't get too worked up about it.<br /><br />As odd as this may sound, I'm somewhat of a New York Knicks fan now. I used them on NBA Live about 2 weeks ago in an exhibition game v. the Lakers. I lost, but the Knicks played well. The Lakers are my new Knicks. Bear in mind, the San Antonio Spurs are still my favorite NBA team and always will be, but I don't mind New York anymore. Isiah Thomas should still be fired, because he's a lousy piece of crap. I even created a ""Fire Isiah"" sign and posted it in my pod at work. Yes Knicks fans, I have joined your plight. Isiah Thomas is so incompetent as a coach, that when he's announced as the coach when I use the Knicks in NBA Live, part of me fears that he's still going to somehow cost my team the game.<br /><br />Now it is time to watch ""Saw IV"" so have a great night everybody :)<br /><br />-Paulus<br /><br />P.S. much love to Stacey and Clare. Stace, you're the best friend anyone could ever ask for. Clare, you know i'll always be here for you. Soon enough, you'll get to have as many ""Paul hugs"" as you'd like. Anytime you need one, i'll be there for you :) You're strong, and even the strongest need support sometimes. *hugs*</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">It sure has been awhile since my last blog. My apologies. Let's get on with it!<br /><br />I applied to university earlier today. The universities I applied to are Windsor, York, and Queens. English is what I've applied for. Each school has a football program, which was a factor in my decision. Obviously, Windsor is my first choice by far. If York offers me the opportunity to start at Wide Receiver (provided i'd be coming off the bench for Windsor) then that will make it a tough decision. I'm fairly certain though, that if I'm accepted to the University of Windsor, I'm going there.<br /><br />Things between Meaghan and I are going quite well. I still don't have feelings for her, which is kind of odd considering that she is quite amazing and very beautiful. She IS a Los Angeles Lakers fan, which is not a good thing. Yes Meghan, I do despise the Lakers. If she was a Knicks fan, I seriously doubt i'd ever want to date her. It's the Knicks for God's sake! What could possibly compell ANYONE to be a Knicks fan? You might as well say that you hate Jews and that Hitler was a saint. To me, it's the same thing. As you can tell, I am not a Knicks fan.<br /><br />I haven't loved basketball for a long time. I do like the sport, but the passion I once had for it will most likely never return. That's fine though. I'm starting to love the sport of football. Sure, it helps that I'm playing football in university this year, but still. It's a really physical sport that requires a lot of braun but an equal amount of brain. You have to be quite strong and athletic but also, you have to memorize playbooks that can be anywhere from 200-500 pages, with about 2 plays per page.<br /><br />It was kind of funny how a few hours ago, Meaghan and I were playing NBA Live 07 simultaneuosly as we spoke on the phone. She was playing on PS2, while I played on my computer. She used her Lakers to beat my Spurs, while I used the Rockets against her Lakers. Of course, I lost. It went to double overtime.<br /><br />If Meaghan and I ever wind up together, that will be quite neat. Whether I find my perfect girl this year or not really doesn't matter. Okay, I lied. So shoot me. I really hope to find my soul mate this year. She's out there, and hopefully she's already in my life. No Megs, I'm not implying anything. Ultimately, attending university and living out my dream of playing university football are my main priorities.<br /><br />The rest of my night will be quite fun, as I will be gaming and watching a movie or two. Which movie(s) i'll be watching, I'm not quite sure yet.<br /><br />Have an awesome night everyone :)<br /><br />-Paulus<br /><br />P.S. congratulations Nick, I'm happy for you bud :)</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">hola! Yes, it has been 3 weeks since I last updated my blog. I do apologize. Just haven't had much time, really.<br /><br />Not much has happened in these last 3 weeks. Work has been quite fun. A girl I went to elementary school with in Burlington (her name is Megan) is chatting with me again. She's pretty cool. She goes to McMaster University in Hamilton, the city where I was born. <br /><br />I wrote a letter to major basketball site www.nbadraft.net (essentially bashing their current mock draft). Now, their main editor wants me to write an NBA Draft blog for the 2008 NBA Draft, which is cool. I haven't followed basketball much this year, but still. It's a major basketball website visited by NBA players, coaches, GM's and college players and coaches, so my name will be out there. It's awesome. It sure helps that I am majoring in English in university next year. Had I decided to become a sportswriter (following in the footsteps of my favorite author, Bill Simmons) i'd be even more excited, but meh. By the way, I strongly recommend picking up a copy of his book. It's called ""Now I Can Die In Peace"" and it's available in paperback. You can order it from your local bookstore. It's a great book and it's not all about sports, so yeah, heh!<br /><br />My athleticism is getting better every week, which is great. I've started taking Myoplex for added bulk, and I'm up to 193 for football. I want to be between 190-195 for Wide Receiver next year for university football.<br /><br />I've decided to write a book. Mind you, it's going to be a 40 year project (I want to publish it when I'm 60) but even so. It will basically be about my life and every memorable experience I've had. I'm also going to have a Fine Arts and Culture section in my book, so that it appeals to a broader reading audience. I guarantee that it will be filled with great, positive stories. All of that sappy crap about how hard life was at times, no thanks. Those memories are non-exsistent. Too many novels focus on hardship and tragedy, so I'm steering clear of that. Nobody needs to delve into the pain I've experienced and ""feel it"" too. My book will be meant to inspire, not make people think ""aww, look at what he overcame to achieve greatness in life."" It's not genuine and it serves no good purpose in life. My positive (and sometimes comical) stories will hopefully be great reading material and show people that focusing on the positive will bring you great things and the ultimate thing we all desire: happiness.<br /><br />That's all for tonight. The right side of my neck is still iffy, because I slept wrong 2 nights ago. I've never experienced neck pain like that before, so it's been fun trying to work that kink out. It's spread to my back, but ah well.<br /><br />Have an awesome night everyone and remember to follow these 3 rules:<br />1) Don't f*ck with people who handle your food<br />2) Always tip your waitress<br />3) never, EVER f*ck with people who handle your cell phone account, because they (and by they, I mean me, for Sprint/Nextel customers) can do ungodly things with the information we have at hand.<br /><br />-Paul</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Quite a week I've had. I don't blog as much as I used to because I'm usually very busy or very tired, so yeah, heh!<br /><br />I think I pulled a back muscle while working out yesterday. There was no sudden sharp pain, but when I woke up today, the right side of my back was throbbing in one place. It's gotten progessively worse as the day has gone on. It's so bad right now that it's affecting my breathing. You know how when a doctor uses a stethoscope to check your breathing and makes you take those awkward deep breaths? That's exactly how my breathing has been tonight. It's rather annoying. A few Tylenol and some rest and hopefully it will heal up quickly.<br /><br />My San Antonio Spurs lost to Dallas tonight. It was a good game, and Dallas was clearly the better team tonight. I'm expecting a Western Conference Finals featuring Dallas and San Antonio. Stay tuned. <br /><br />Anyways, I'm going to game for a bit. Not having a stellar night, so i'll leave it at that.<br /><br />-Paul</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Hey everyone, it's been awhile. Today has sucked, but ah well.<br /><br />There's a snowstorm today, but meh. There are a few people I've decided not to talk to anymore. I would name them, but they know who they are. It's been a waste of time ever having them in my life to begin with, so it's time to essentially filter out the trash, so to speak. I'm not going to get hung up on who does and does not like me, because it's a waste of time. People's thoughts and feelings about me have no bearing on where i'll wind up in life. I'm going to succeed and reach all of my goals, regardless of what people think. I may exceed their expectations, but I will be meeting mine. <br /><br />I'm going to Ottawa in 10 days to see Steph. That should be a fun time. Steph and I are supposedly going out on a date when I go, but we'll see. I don't really care for that shit right now. I've contemplated not going to Ottawa, but again, we shall see. I just need to relax and have a great time and really focus on getting ready for football next year. Not to mention I have to start getting ready to go back to school (I'm going back in January).<br /><br />As for tonight, I may go see a movie. I'm thinking about going to see that new animated movie about bees. It looks pretty awesome. I may buy some DVD's, or perhaps buy The Sims 2 for my computer. <br /><br />My pizza should be here soon, and I'm going to watch a movie at the same time. I'm thinking about watching Saw III, but I'm not too sure yet.<br /><br />Have a great day everyone!<br /><br />-Paul</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Hola! Game 4 of the World Series is tonight. The Boston Red Sox lead the series 3-0. If Boston wins tonight, they will win their second World Series in a span of 4 years. This after going 86 straight seasons without winning one. It's pretty amazing.<br /><br />Yes, I will be keeping a blog of tonight's game. It should be a great game. I'm really looking forward to it. <br /><br />Before we get to to my game blog, I suppose i'll update you people on my life. Well, not really. All I want to say is that I'm going to Ottawa on November 23rd to see Stephanie. It's going to be pretty awesome. I can't wait to see her. The trip will also give me a chance to check out the Carleton University campus, a school I'm considering for university next year. Well, again, not really. Unless they add a football program there next year, I won't be considering Carleton. I want a great education, but I also want to play football. I've been preparing diligently for it.<br /><br />I changed my mind on what position I want to play next year. I've decided to focus on being a Wide Receiver instead. I have NFL size for a Wide Receiver, and it's a position I'm quite familiar with. In my third or fourth year of university, i'll look to play Free Safety. <br /><br />On with the game blog!<br /><br />8:19pm: Trisha Yearwood is singing the ""Star Spangled Banner."" Having watched this World Series, I've come to realize how full of itself America really is. They pride themselves on being a war country. They take so much pride in dropping bombs on other countries and fighting pathetic wars, and they expect everyone to feel sorry for them at the same time. <br /><br />8:21pm: Nice montage to the Toronto Blue Jays 1993 World Series championship. SportsNet is playing a game by game montage of that series. It's pretty awesome.<br /><br />8:24pm: I'm going to watch the game on FOX instead. When Boston wins tonight, it will be amazing to hear Tim McCarver's ""The Boston Red Sox are world champions!"" call. When I heard that call in 2004, it was priceless. It was the best call I have ever heard in any sport. Although, I'm pretty sure that Gus Johnson, who is an NCAA men's basketball commentator, could come up with something better. Remember, he is the same man who brokered peace between Bill Simmons (my favorite author/sportswriter) and Isaiah Thomas, the worst executive in the history of pro sports. Thomas once threatened Bill Simmons, saying ""there will be trouble"" if he ever met him on the street. Reason being is because Simmons (a.k.a. The Sports Guy on ESPN.com) ripped Thomas in a column 2 years ago.<br /><br />8:29pm: That last paragraph was rather long, sorry. I'm getting quite hungry. Once my dad is finished in the kitchen, I am going to make some spaghetti. Pasta is goooood! *pops*<br /><br />8:45pm: Oh how lovely, I missed the first run of the game. Dammit! I was getting something to drink and I also talked to my dad. Now I have to go make some pasta. Fear not, this game blog will be my best yet.<br /><br />8:49pm: Never mind, my dad is not yet finished cooking my mom her late dinner. However, I have a Tim Horton's capuccino and Stephanie is now online, so I'm happy.<br /><br />8:50pm: Oh, nice play by Rockies third baseman Garret Atkins. He threw out Mike Lowell at first after scooping up a tough ground ball.<br /><br />8:53pm: 3-1 count to Jason Varitek. Space filler. Hmm.<br /><br />8:54pm: Varitek grounded out to second base. It's a 1-2-3 inning for Rockies starting pitcher Aaron Cook. Why I felt compelled to mention that, I'm not exactly sure. Provacative!<br /><br />9:04pm: Still waiting to make my pasta. I'm also chatting with Steph. Once my pasta is made, this blog will become infinately more entertaining, I promise.<br /><br />9:14pm: Okay, I am going to make my food now. Steph and I were chatting for awhile, so I got caught up, heh! I'll be back soon.<br /><br />9:22pm: Pasta is coming along nicely. Kaz Matsui just hit a double. It's still 1-0 Red Sox, whoo!<br /><br />9:43pm: And I'm done. Good stuff, heh!<br /><br />9:44pm: It's still 1-0 Red Sox in the bottom of the 4th inning. <br /><br />9:46pm: Jon Lester just walked Ryan Spillborghs, or however you spell it. This game just got interesting. If only I would do the same, we'd be much better off.<br /><br />9:53pm: Baseball blogs suck. I think this blog would be more interesting if I was watching golf. The game has been fun and exciting to watch, but there's no ""oh wow!"" moments. So again, I cut this one short. <br /><br />adios!<br /><br />-Paul</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Hola everybody! Yes, I have decided to do a Game 7 blog of the Indians-Red Sox series. Whoever wins tonight will be going to the World Series to play the Colorado Rockies. <br /><br />Steph (my date for February 11th) thought my Game 6 blog was rather amusing. Hopefully, tonight's game blog will be much better. <br /><br />As my boy Cabbie would say: Let's go do this!<br /><br />8:01pm: You have to love the pre-game shows. If you want more useless information than you can handle, just tune in to any FOX pre-game show, regardless of the sport. Joe Buck and Tim McCarver will be calling tonight's game live from Fenway Park in Boston. They're a pretty good announcing duo. <br /><br />8:03pm: I apologize for that last sentence. I've caught FOX's ""useless information"" bug. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go get some chips.<br /><br />8:10pm: You know, I might actually enjoy the ""ouuuurr country"" commercial tonight. It's been a great day and I'm feeling great, so it's possible that I won't kick an innocent child when this commercial plays 137 times tonight.<br /><br />8:13pm: Tonight's pitching match-up features Cleveland's Jake Westbrook facing off against Boston's $103 millon man, Dice-K Matsuzaka. I'm a big fan of Dice and I expect a great game out of him tonight.<br /><br />8:15pm: The ""ouuuur country"" commercial just played for the first time tonight. I actually enjoyed it. You see? I told you I might not mind it tonight. <br /><br />8:16pm: I'm calling it right now; Boston will win this game 7-3. I'm guaranteeing a victory for the Red Sox. Why? I don't know exactly. I suppose it's a lame attempt to make this blog more interesting than it actually is.<br /><br />8:25: First pitch, here we go! Ball one. Should be an awesome game.<br /><br />8:26pm: Grady Sizemore leads off with a broken bat fly out to 2nd base. Let's go Red Sox!<br /><br />8:32pm: Dice-K retires the Indians in order, whoo! He just struck out Travis Hafner to end the top of the 1st inning. I am officially in ""game 7 mode"" and pumped. <br /><br />8:36pm: Dustin Pedroia leads off the bottom of the 1st inning with a single! My opening statements are becoming a little too predictable. I'm sorry. I feel like going for a run, but I won't.<br /><br />8:44pm: 1-0 Boston! Manny Ramirez just hit an RBI single over the head of Cleveland shortstop Jhonny (not a spelling error) Peralta.<br /><br />8:46pm: Here we go again. The bases are now loaded for J.D. Drew. He hit a grand slam in the 1st inning of last night's game. Can he do it again? I sure hope so.<br /><br />8:48pm: I guess not. Drew just grounded into an inning-ending double play. He's forgiven though. The fact is, Boston leads 1-0 after the 1st inning, so I'm happy. I'm sure Stephanie is as well. Her and I want Boston to win. Good thing too; I might have cancelled our date had she told me she was rooting for Cleveland. Okay, not really, but wouldn't that be funny? Actually, no. She is a sweetheart and I'm excited to visit her in December. I know you're reading this Steph and I just want to say; you're great. You've got a lot of the qualities that I look for in a girl and I'm happy you feel about me the way I feel about you.<br /><br />8:59pm: You know what?  I typed a long game blog last night, and that one was decent at best. It's kind of inconvenient for me to type a blog that likely will take me 2 1/2 hours to complete. I'm fairly certain Steph is the only one who will read this blog that actually cares about baseball. I'd much rather enjoy the game than have to look for anything even mildly interesting to write about. I'm trying to enjoy the game while trying to write an interesting game blog. It's fairly easy to do, but the fact is, I wrote one last night. It's more of the same commericials, the same announcers, same players (except for the starting pitchers). If anything even mildly interesting occurs during the rest of the game (i.e. my getting a girlfriend, a game winning home run.....ect.) i'll continue the blog. I'm still having a great night, but I'm quite tired tonight after a long day. <br /><br />Thank you for reading my abbreviated Game 7 blog. <br /><br />Have a great night everyone!<br /><br />-Paul</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">I'm watching Game 6 of the Cleveland Indians-Boston Red Sox series. I decided I am going to write a blog throughout the entire game. Mind you, Bill Simmons (who happens to be my favorite author) is also typing an up-to-date game blog as well, but meh. Red Sox right fielder J.D. Drew hit a 1st inning grand slam. Simmons (who is Drew's biggest critic) had to have been in ecstasy upon seeing Drew belt out that home run, which made it 4-0 for Boston. <br /><br />As I was typing that first paragraph, Indians catcher Victor Martinez hit a solo home run in the top of the 2nd inning. <br /><br />On with the blog!<br /><br />9:04pm: Just as the 2nd inning ended, FOX was playing ""Cleveland Rocks"" while showing footage of Cleveland starting pitcher Fausto Carmona sitting in the dugout. I mention this because 1) Cleveland sucks 2) They trail 4-1 after 1 1/2 innings and 3) Carmona looks like he just saw a ghost. I'm serious. He looks like a frightened child. <br /><br />9:07pm: A Bud Light ad just played as the game returned from commercial. I'm drinking Laker Red. I feel like you should know these things.<br /><br />9:08pm: The crotch grabber is at bat! Red Sox shortstop Julio Lugo practically makes an X-rated movie with every at-bat. Doesn't FOX have censorship agreements? Nobody wants to see a mediocre baseball player play pocket pool every time he shows up on T.V. <br /><br />9:14 pm: An infield hit by Kevin Youkilis! Nicely done. Yes, I am a Red Sox fan. Okay, not really. They're my American League team. I &lt;3 the Atlanta Braves, but the Red Sox are cool.<br /><br />9:15pm: The most over-played commercial of all-time is on; that stupid Chevy commercial. The whole ""this is ouuuur country"" song is pathetic and over-played. Why did Chevy executives ever think think this was a good idea? It sucks!<br /><br />9:18 pm: Guh! Just chugged my first beer of the night. Nasty! The first beer of the night always tastes horrible. Luckily, I also have pizza. I may go to the gym tomorrow, i'll see how I'm feeling.<br /><br />9:21pm: The Indians have just recorded 2 straight hits to lead off the bottom of the 3rd inning. <br /><br />9:22pm: Every girl's favorite player is at bat night now for Cleveland. Grady Sizemore just lined out to J.D. Drew in right field though, so I'm happy. <br /><br />9:23pm: Man this pizza is spicy. I guess that's what you get for having hot peppers on pizza. It's good though, damn good.<br /><br />9:28pm: Great job Curt Schilling! The Red Sox starting pitcher just got Travis Hafner to ground out to first base to end the inning. The Indians failed to score, which is great.<br /><br />9:29pm: Just to let you know, if I end this blog early, I am sorry. Watching the game has made me want to play MVP Baseball 2005. <br /><br />9:33pm: Manny Ramirez just drew a walk. What a name.....Manny. When I go to university next year, I may just buy a turtle and call him Manny. It's such a cool name. Have you ever met an uncool Manny? I didn't think so.<br /><br />9:34pm: Beer number 2, here we go! Okay, I have to wait for the foam to subside before I chug it. This is why cans suck.<br /><br />9:36pm: Carmona just walked his second consecutive batter. That brings up J.D. Drew. He actually received a standing ovation! Am I seeing this? Clearly I must be drunk right now. <br /><br />9:37pm: RBI single for Drew! Wow! 5-1 Red Sox.<br /><br />9:38pm: That's the end of the night for Fausto Carmona. His tongue was actually hanging out of his mouth before FOX went to commercial. For a second, I thought it was a beagle pitching for the Indians. Although, with how they've played these last 2 games, a german sheppard would have been a good choice to pitch for Cleveland tonight.<br /><br />9:42pm: The foam has subsided in my beer, so here we go!<br /><br />9:44pm: I just chugged it (it took me about 5 seconds to do so) and it was quite good. As soon as I did that, Jacoby Ellsbury just blooped an RBI single into left field. It's now 6-1 for Boston. <br /><br />9:45pm: Luuuuugggooooo!!!!!!!!!! He's hitting 3-19 in this series. <br /><br />9:46pm: And of course, he comes through with a 2 run double. It's now 8-1 for Boston. Amazing! I am anxious to see what Bill Simmons has to say in his blog tomorrow. The two Red Sox players he despises the most (J.D. Drew and Julio Lugo) have come up with huge games tonight. <br /><br />9:51pm: 10-1 Red Sox! Jesus Christ! Kevin Youkilis just hit a 2 run double. He was also hit by the relay throw.<br /><br />9:57pm: Oh, my friend Meghan is now chatting with me. Well, I wouldn't exactly call her a friend, but still. Her cousin is Leafs goalie Andrew Raycroft. My God do I ever hate the Leafs. Now I can understand why I can't stand Meghan, heh!<br /><br />10:00pm: Inning over, finally! FOX decided to play a good song for once; ""Crazy"" by Gnarls Barkley. That song doesn't really go with the theme of the series, but hey, it was nice.<br /><br />10:05pm: Curt Schilling looks like he's hung over tonight. He may very well be. His wind up is so slow, solar eclipses occur during each pitch. Hey, it's Saturday, I'm not using my A material tonight. <br /><br />10:09pm: The Indians got a few hits, but they failed to score. That's a regular game for the Toronto Maple Leafs. ZING!<br /><br />10:12pm: There are no interesting commercials to report/lambast, so I apologize for the delay. On a side note, the Indians have a guy pitching right now whose last name is Laffey. Are Tim McCarver and Joe Buck (the FOX announcers for tonights game) high? Why have they failed to mention that Aaron Laffey's last name rhymes with Daffy, as in duck? Laffey Daffy, quack quack! Something even remotely funny would suffice. Is that so hard?<br /><br />10:17pm: What a catch by Grady Sizemore! He just robbed Jacoby ""the Amish boy"" Ellsbury of a double. Quite a catch indeed.<br /><br />10:18pm: More political propaganda from the United States. Why do they waste money on these commercials? I guess the real question is, why does FOX allow this garbage to be advertised in the first place? <br /><br />10:23pm: My buddy Nick just said he is rooting for the Colorado Rockies to win the World Series. I am going to have to hit that guy. He's hopped on their bandwagon. I know Nick from basketball, and he is a really bright guy. However, he is high on the October air, or some other illegal substance.<br /><br />10:28pm: Nick just told me he likes the Rockies because of Canadian pitcher Jeff Francis. It's ""because he's Canadian"" according to him. What a lame reason.<br /><br />10:44pm: I apologize for the massive delay in my blog. Nick and I just had a rather heated discussion about life. <br /><br />10:58pm: This blog officially sucks because of my chat with Nick on MSN. <br /><br />11:00pm: After my next 2-3 beers, I will end this blog. Boston is up 10-2 after 7 innings, so it's game over.<br /><br />11:07pm: My best friend Stacey and I are now chatting. She's amazing :) I sent her a care package yesterday. It consists of a pendent and a painting I did for her (also named after her) back in March. She saw the painting on webcam and she loved it.<br /><br />11:09pm: The Indians are warming up their closer, Joe Borowski. It's good to note because Cleveland is still trailing 10-2. This is why I love play-off baseball.<br /><br />11:15pm: Okay, I'm ending this blog. There are no good commercials, the game is practically over, and Stacey and I are chatting. <br /><br />11:17pm: One more beer to go. Okay, i'll likely chug a few more later on, but still.<br /><br />11:18pm: Yuck! This beer tasted nasty! <br /><br />11:21pm: This blog is not yet done, heh! Sorry. Manny Ramirez just hit a sacrifice fly to center field. It's now 11-2 for Boston. <br /><br />11:23pm: RBI single for Mike Lowell! 12-2 for the Red Sox. That hit came off Indians closer Joe Borowski. It's not really relevent, but I don't care.<br /><br />11:29pm:&nbsp; The Red Sox have brought in Eric Gagne to pitch. He holds the major league record with 83 consecutive saves. However, according to BIll Simmons, he sucks now. I still love Gagne though, and I believe he will be dominant once again in the very near future.<br /><br />11:33pm: Game over! There is going to be a game 7 tomorrow night, whoo! The Indians are starting Jake Westbrook while the Red Sox will starting Japanese import Daisuke Matsuzaka. I'm a big fan of Dice-K, so I'm really excited for Game 7 tomorrow night.<br /><br />Thank you for reading this blog, I hope you all have an awesome night!<br /><br />-Paul</font>"

The customers I spoke to were fairly upbeat and cheerful. I suppose that's nice.<br /><br />I was going to read Bill Simmons Game 4 blog (the game between the Red Sox and Indians) but meh, I can always read that tonight. I'll be heading straight to the gym after work. I'll likely pump iron until 8:30-9pm. I really have to work out my legs and my wrists today. Well, I don't have to, but meh, I feel like it, heh! I feel like you should know these things.<br /><br />After that, I have to walk home, which will be fun. When I get home, I am going to game for a bit and also eat. Stacey and I are going to have a long talk tonight, which is good. It's been awhile since her and I have had one of those. They're always really good and it makes us both feel great. It's pretty awesome.<br /><br />I got some lapel pin at work today. It's for signing up for a cancer thing a few weeks ago. I'm either going to send it to Stacey, Christina, or Steph. I suppose whichever of them wants it, they'll get it. I kind of owe it to Stacey, but it's her call. I owe it to her because I was a complete ass to her last night. I'm sorry sweetie. You know you're still my best friend, by far.<br /><br />much love everyone!<br /><br />-Paul</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">It's a great night, and hey, I'm watching a great football game on T.V. right now, so I will blog about it. Yes, the game is in the 3rd quarter, and it's between 2 teams I don't like all that much (the Atlanta Falcons and the New York Giants) but whatever. It's been a great game so I'm going to blog about the rest of the game.<br /><br />It's 21-10 for the Giants right now. I never thought I would say this, but I am really impressed with how well the Giants have played tonight, especially on defense. They have sacked Falcons QB John Joseph Harrington 4 times tonight. Pretty impressive if you ask me. Okay, it's Harrington, I understand that, but still. The ease with which they have gotten to Harrington is astonishing, really. <br /><br />The fact is, Harrington has just held on to the ball too long. He could have easily avoided those sacks by doing something any smart QB would do; throw the ball away. Then again, the words ""smart"" and ""quarterback"" don't exactly go hand in hand for Atlanta Falcons QB's (Michael Vick anyone?). <br /><br />Amani Toomer just broke Tiki Barber's franchise record for receptions by a Giants player. Tiki Barber was an All-Pro RB for the Giants for many years, and he retired after last season. As my favorite author/sportswriter Bill Simmons would say: I feel like you should know these things.<br /><br />Amani Toomer just caught another pass that is being challenged by Falcons head coach Bobby Petrino. Toomer clearly caught the ball, but I guess Petrino is thinking ""hey, my team sucks anyways, why not prove how incompetent a coach I am in the mean time?"" <br /><br />I find myself cheering for the Giants tonight. Yes, you know it's a weird night when..... Wow, the catch was overturned! It must be a full moon tonight. <br /><br />Can somebody please gag Tony Kornheiser? He's an analyst for ESPN's broadcast team tonight. Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes (who is from Scotland) just nailed a 32 yard field goal, and Kornheiser had this to say immediately following the kick: ""I wonder if in Scotland, he kicked in a kilt."" If Mike Tirico doesn't slap Kornheiser upside the head soon, I'm going to fly to Atlanta and do it myself.<br /><br />This is awesome! One of my favorite players just made a nice kick. Yes, one of my favorite NFL players happens to be Falcons punter Michael Koenen. Living in Timmins will do that to you. Koenen was great for me on Madden 07, so that's why he is one of my favorite players. It's the ""Madden Effect"" if you will. <br /><br />Tony Kornheiser is talking again.....I feel a stroke coming on. Ladies and gentlemen, Tony Kornheiser!<br /><br />There are 8 minutes left in the game, and the Giants are leading 24-10. Nice catch by Jeremey Shockey, a tight end for the Giants and one of the best in the game. Just short of the 1st down though. The Giants also failed to convert on 3rd and 3, so they were forced to punt. <br /><br />Yet another incomplete pass thrown by John Joseph Harrington. When is Byron Leftwich going to be called upon for the Falcons? The guy only has a career record of 24-20, and he is one of the best young QB's in the game.<br /><br />ESPN just showed a list of Mel Kiper's top senior QB's for the 2008 NFL Draft. I think Kiper was high on methamphetamine when he created this list. How the hell do you rank Boston College's Matt Ryan ahead of Hawaii's Colt Brennan and Kentucky's Andre' Woodson? I don't expect anyone to answer that question, but meh.<br /><br />Touchdown Giants! Derrick Ward just scored a rushing touchdown. The extra point is good and it's now 31-10 Giants. <br /><br />There are 2 minutes left in the game, but the Giants have possession of the ball and they are going to run out the clock, so i'll end this blog.<br /><br />As for the rest of my night, I am going to watch Game 4 of the NLCS between the Diamondbacks and Rockies. Perhaps i'll game for a bit as well.<br /><br />Have a great night everyone!<br /><br />-Paul<br /></font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Hey everyone, hope all is well. Let's get on with the blog, shall we?<br /><br />Not a whole lot to report lately, really. Christina hasn't spoken much to me as of late, so I deleted her off MSN and I'm just going to let it go. I love her, but there's a saying, right? If you truly love something, let it go, and if belongs with you, it will return. It goes something like that. That's true in every instance, I suppose. We'll see what happens.<br /><br />My friend Mel and I are going clubbing next week-end, which should be fun. I'm really excited to be returning to school in January. That will be awesome. Just to be back in class on a daily basis, learning, and being with my awesome friends from Windsor all the time, it'll be amazing.<br /><br />The whole love thing, it's weird. Like, I have that feeling deep down that I'm going to be in a relationship again real soon. The thing is, I would never, EVER, under any circumstances, date a girl from Timmins ever again. I don't see how the relationship I'm feeling i'll be in soon will happen, seeing as how what I mentioned above, I'm going to stay true to. Stay tuned, I guess.<br /><br />As for now, I am going to play some NBA Live and I suppose i'll do a painting later. It's quite chilly to go for a run, but I may do that too.<br /><br />take care and have a great one :)<br /><br />-Paul<br /></font>"

I did the unthinkable and actually helped a New York Yankees fan with his cell phone today. I'm a huge Atlanta Braves fan, but the Boston Red Sox are my token American League team. The baseball gods will now shun the Red Sox, LOL!<br /><br />My knee felt pretty great today, until around lunch time. I took a long walk and it started throbbing. It then gave out on me at one point. It also gave out on me on my way home. <br /><br />My flu-like symptoms caught up with me today. I was uber dizzy and light-headed throughout my entire shift, sometimes almost passing out in my chair. I had awesome customers though, so that made my day go by quickly and it was great :)<br /><br />Tomorrow is my day off, which is cool. I'll just wind up sleeping most of the day and i'll try to feel better. <br /><br />Well I'm falling asleep as I type this.

However, I am in such a great mood that I've decided to go for a light jog soon. With ankle weights, I'm not sure yet. I am wearing my knee tensor though. That should alleviate pain and give me a nice spring in my step when I jog. <br /><br />My friend Steph (from Carleton University) are going on a date.....on February 11th, hah! Yeah, I asked her out on a date. We're going to go see my San Antonio Spurs take on my (former) Toronto Raptors at the Air Canada Center. I swear, I will be in ecstasy seeing the Spurs play for the first time. And course, as conventional wisdom has proven, they will go on to lose in the NBA Finals a few months later. <br /><br />I just took my energy pills, so soon I will be heading out for my jog. Afterwards, I am going to clean my room then do whatever, heh!<br /><br />As for now, I am going to play a game :)<br /><br />Have an awesome day everyone!<br /><br />-Paulus<br /><br />P.S. hope you feel better soon Christina &lt;3 *muah*</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Hey everyone, how are things? Life is great for me, in case you're wondering.<br /><br />Quick note: if you disagree with my blogs, don't read them. I disagree with the War in Iraq, and you don't see me gluing myself to the T.V. focusing on the coverage and talking to people about how much I hate it. You know what that's called people? It's called common sense. Here's a great quote you people should live by ""What you resist, persists."" I know my friends truly understand that quote, and they live by it.<br /><br />I suffered a slight tear in my MCL in my right knee a few days ago. The doctor said I won't require surgery, which is awesome, so I can still play football in university next year. I just have to get a few weeks of rest, which is fine. I'm getting acupuncture treatment on my knee sometime next week, which will be neat. Should help speed up the healing process and make my knee stronger than it's ever been. <br /><br />I have to admit, I'm really excited to be attending university next year. I finally get to live out my dream of playing football in university next year. I've narrowed my choices down to York University and the University of Windsor. Coach Morencie (of the University of Windsor) is a great guy and a great coach. It'd be an honor to play for him. Obviously, I'm giving York University equal consideration, seeing as how they have the best version of my program, but still. I know i'll be uber happy about whichever university I choose to attend.<br /><br />Sometime in November, I'm going to check out the University of Windsor campus. Then in December, i'll be visiting York's campus, provided I have a friend from there with whom I can stay. I want to meet with their football coach and see where i'd fit in with their team. The campus itself is beautiful, and it has such a relaxed aura about it. It's like a condensed version of Windsor. I love it :)<br /><br />I've been really sick lately, and it's not something I'm used to. It's a ""drunken illness"" as I like to call it. Stuffy nose, stuffy throat, and a drunken-esque dizziness. It's like being drunk with a really bad cold, only I'm aware of everything. I sometime randomly lose my&nbsp; balance, and I get random massive head rushes. Christina has been experiencing the same type of illness lately as well. Hope you feel better soon sweetie &lt;3<br /><br />Yeah, looking back, Christina is the most amazing young woman I have ever met. Of the girls who've loved me this year, she is the only one who kept her promises. I don't love her anymore, obviously, but her and I are really close, which is great. <br /><br />TH&amp;VS has football pratice at 12pm tomorrow, and one of their players (who happens to be a good friend of mine) invited me to come practice with the team tomorrow. I said I can't because of my knee, so he said I can at least just watch and ask Mr. Delich if I can join their coaching staff, to learn more about the game. I don't even care if I have an official position with the team, if I can just learn more about the game and have the team help me prepare for university football, I'm all for it. <br /><br />I really have no time for a girlfriend nowadays. A girl at work likes me (I found it out today through a friend of hers) but I told her friend I'm not interested. I have to focus on my education and on getting ready for university football. Having a girlfriend would just waste valuble time preparing for football. I know i'll get married eventually to an amazing young woman, but for now, I'm focusing on achieving my dream of playing football in university. That, and under no circumstances ever, will I ever date a girl from Timmins. Nothing will ever change that. <br /><br />Her friend tried selling me on her friends' finer points (including the fact that her friend loves sports) but once she realized I wasn't changing my mind, she was cool with it. I'll meet an amazing girl in university next year, which is cool. <br /><br />As for the rest of my night, I am still feeling really sick, so I will rest for awhile. Just going to&nbsp; take some Tylenol and game for a bit.<br /><br />Have a great night everyone, and remember, there's always something to smile about :) Focus on what you love, and you will attract more things to love. <br /><br />-Paulus<br /><br />P.S. SPUURRRRRSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!! lol, Steph knows what I mean :P</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Hola!<br /><br />I just got off the phone with the University of Windsor's football coach, which is awesome. He told a friend of mine from facebook to e-mail him so we can discuss my playing for his team next year. I sent the e-mail 3 days ago, but only today did I receive a notification saying it didn't send. So I called him up and we had a nice chat and he gave me an alternate e-mail address to send my information to.<br /><br />He said he is going to send me a winter workout program he wants me to follow and some more information on their football program. I'm really excited. He said he wants me to bulk up to 185-190 and be really fast if I want to play Free Safety (the position I told him I want to play) for his squad next year. I'm currently at 182. By the end of October, i'll be at my desired weight and ready to show him what I've got when I go to Windsor for a visit in November. I'm really motivated.<br /><br />I have no emotional heartstrings attached to any girl right now, which is great. It's allowed me to put all of my love and dedication into my education and university football. It's amazing.<br /><br />Right now, my friend (and first girlfriend, LOL) Jenny is helping me look up a list of banned substances for university athletics. I take substances from GNC so I'm just making sure i'll pass a drug test when I play university football. So far, so good, heh!<br /><br />I've not been feeling too well lately. I was really sick last night and for some reason, I thought I was going to die in my sleep. I felt really sick at work today as well. I'm quite nausious. That being said, I am going for a run soon.<br /><br />Have an awesome night everyone!<br /><br />-Paul</font>"

"event","<font size=""4"">Ah, what an amazing day :) <br /><br />Work was amazing. I had perhaps the coolest customer ever call me. I'm not really going to go in-depth as to why, but this woman inspired me, to say the least. I also never knew I could have such a positively profound impact on somebody like her in such a short period of time. If I can inspire one person to be great each day of my life, I'm happy. <br /><br />I wasn't planning on running tonight, as my calves and ankles were killing me all day long. The walk home after work, hah, I almost collapsed. My muscles were that sore.<br /><br />After a few hours of rest though, my legs felt good enough to run. So I ran and when I got home, the uber pain returned to my ankles and calves. Right now, they are soaking in a foot massage bath, and I plan on sleeping like this. I'll find a way, heh! My knees are prettty sore too. Ah well. <br /><br />In time, running with my ankle weights will become second nature to me. I am so excited to be attending St. Clair College again this January. I'll be able to go for long runs without slipping on ice, LOL! Plus i'll be teammates with Joe in basketball again, which will be awesome. Not to mention chilling with Zed and Ian and all of my awesome friends from Windsor. God I love you people! heh, a bit much, but you people are awesome. <br /><br />I'm buying a new cell phone in 2 weeks, only because Christina wants me to get one so she can ""text me 24/7"" as she so kindly put it, heh! Yes, Christina and I are close once again. I'm really glad too. She made me feel love back in June when I never thought i'd feel it again. I thank you so much for that, and for loving me at a time when I was still heartbroken over Marie. <br /><br />Christina, you are awesome :) I'm glad you've finally found a guy who treats you like the amazing girl that you are :)<br /><br />My lovely friend Devon (who looks like Scarlett Johanssen in my opinion, heh!) is getting me to revise an essay of hers, so that should be fun. I'm also talking to a girl named Steph from Calgary who just re-added me to MSN who I do not remember at all. She said we used to chat a few years ago, but it doesn't ring a bell. meh, I'm sure i'll remember her in time.<br /><br />Anyways, I have to revise Devon's essay and then chat and game for a bit.<br /><br />Have a great night everyone!<br /><br />-Paul<br /><br />P.S. Spurs indeed baby! hah, Steph from Carelton University, you know what I mean ;)</font>"

We've got a CD release coming out in May-ish on Profound Lore Records and Sound Devastation is releasing a vinyl version of the album not too long after that. We have a show in May in Brooklyn and will have more in the surrounding areas (still getting confirmation on those. 

The girls are great. Kay will be 4 this year (in about a week) and Robin will be 14. Yeah, I know. I'm coming up on 30 this year but it's looking to be one of the best years of my life so how in the world could I complain?

I got remarried last year and have been really happy. I try to look back and learn from my marriage to Alex, but it is getting to the point now that I am such a different person that none of that applies anymore. A lot of it anyway... I wouldn't say none. I have very different situations to apply these lessons to. Things that I accepted to be one way are quite another now and each has been okay for me for where I am at in my life, but sometimes it seems so foreign-- the life I used to live. 

I miss people I used to know. If anyone wants to reconnect then send me a message. I've got a ton going on but would love to catch up."

I know a lot of you who are friends with both Alex and me might not be thrilled to hear how well my new relationship is going.... or his for that matter, because you are used to us together and not apart. I guess as we grew and changed we kind of outgrew each other. Maybe made a few mistakes that ""sorry"" wasn't good enough for. Had the same arguments a few hundred too many times.

Yes, notzebob.... will you be my friend? Please please, be my friend! I'd be lost without you. It's okay... you don't have to call. Don't have to write! I know so many people at UGA... faculty and staff...even people in the ITS department who can make extra sure that we can meet!! They'll help me find you. Then we can be REAL friends. REAL CLOSE FRIENDS. Sorry I couldn't share what you wrote to me before. It was so personal to me, so special, that I couldn't even bear to let anyone else know about it. But now that I know... now that I am CLOSER to you... I can share our special friendship with the world. I know you won't hide yourself beyond anonymous journals and then smile a fake smile over the phone when we talk to make it sound genuine. NO, not you. You'll be true to our friendship... will really know and understand what friendship means. Only you, notzebob. Hearing you is like sweet familiarity. You make me miss someone so very deeply... hopefully YOU can be a substitute. 

Thanks for an amusing afternoon. There wasn't anything on cable anyway. It was kind of like a pathetic jigsaw puzzle. Yeah, that works."

"event","Okay so the first day I was wondering why in the world I decided to put myself through this. I couldn't believe they did it outpatient and neither could my mother (my husband stayed home to keep the baby) so we stayed in a motel room near the hospital just in case I encountered any problems. I had a lot of nausea... like motion sickness and weakness, but it was probably from the pain meds. 

I have been home a couple days now though and it seems every day gets better and better. I am much more mobile now. I have this big binder thing on and under that I am all bandaged up. My doc said if I seeped through the bandages that I could change them but since I haven't I don't think I should mess with them... no matter how curious I am to see the incision or my new belly button. Right now I have no idea at all what any of my new tummy looks like. I don't appear to have any bruising as far as I can tell but I am sure that will change as time goes on. I can't imagine not having any bruising for something like this. 

My follow up is Monday. Hopefully my drainage will be down enough that I can have at least one of these drain tubes removed. I'll take pics as soon as there is something to see."

"event","While I am still swollen it is so nice to be able to unwrap this binder and look down at my new tummy. I am way past the regret phase and am now looking forward to the ""all healed up and raring to go"" phase.

I am drinking green tea like crazy to reduce swelling. Anything else that anyone knows of that is good for swelling would be appreciated. My birthday is coming up this Friday, which coincidentally is the day the last drain tube and the belly button stitches come out. Apparently the drain fairy WAS good to me this time around and only made me keep one drain for 5 days and the other for 9. Compared to the 6 weeks with the drain after the gastric bypass this is nothing (not that I am enjoying it at all but...).

I'm sure you guys are tired of hearing about all my surgical procedures, LOL. I promise I am only a boob job away from being all done but you guys have some time to wait before I start going on and on about my tits.

"event","Okay so I am back from my tummy tuck and hernia repair operation and to stop the rumors before they start I am doing quite well. They even did it outpatient if you can believe that. I thought for sure that I would at least stay overnight but they released me after I stayed in recovery for a couple hours. 

The first day I felt like crap... the second day I wondered why in the world I had ever decided this was a good idea. Today I am up and about and have hardly taken any pain meds at all. I am still on some pretty intense antibiotics (1500 mg a day of Keflex). I think he wants to be extra careful about infection because of the Enbrel I was on (it is an immunosuppressor for my psoriasis... I have been off of it for a couple months). 

I still have not seen the results, not even a little. My tummy is totally bandaged and taped up and then covered with a compression binder to reduce swelling and to get the skin to adhere to the muscle wall in its new location (fun). I also have 2 drains below my incision to suck out the excess fluid from the swelling. Any of you who were around after my gastric bypass surgery can remember my great love for jackson pratt drains. Hopefully I have earned my props in this area and the drain fairy will be kind and they can be removed soon. The amount they are draining is decreasing quickly so things are looking good for a quick removal. I haven't noticed any bruising at all except where they tried to put in the first IV (and failed). I am sure there are bruises there though.

Monday I go back to the doc for a follow up. I can only assume that this will be the great unveiling so I am very excited. I have been able to peek in from the top and kind of see my new belly button, though it is covered with a small round bandage. At least I know where the doc decided to put it. I am very curious how much excess skin he took... like how many pounds. Oh, and though he didn't do my scar revision for my gastric bypass scar the stretching that he did seemed to flatten the scar some. It is actually looking pretty tame in comparison to what it was. It was never really horrible to begin with (thanks Dr H). 

My biggest complaint right now is that I am itching under the bandages where I am already starting to heal and I have no way at all to scratch it. To me there are not many things worse that an unscratched itch (okay yeah I know.... double meaning... sexual innuendo, got it). I wish I could see it though, damn it! I know it is much better off staying covered for these first few days but it would make the discomfort so much easier if I had some perspective to balance it out. 

Oh btw, don't have a tummy tuck and then use the time laying around as a good excuse to watch stand up comedy. I made it about 5 minutes and had to switch it. Coughing is also out, and so is vomiting (which sometimes happens when you stand up too suddenly 1 day post op). 

Some of you have asked for Beltaine details. We're looking at a camping event 1.5 hrs from Atlanta from 5-4 to 5-8. It is beautiful here... we're on a mountain in freaking paradise! Expect some rituals, bonfires, drum circles, swimming, games, yummy food at a reasonable price, and general fun getting to know people stuff. We're making this 18 and up, bring your own tent. $20 if you pre-reg $30 at the door. If you get 5 people to pre-reg you get in free. We'll have a work day before the actual event which is volunteer only but we'll feed you and all sit around a fire and relax at the end of the day. We just need to do some controlled burning to clear some underbrush and some general cleaning up of the area where we'll be. I don't expect a huge 400 person kind of event but if you want to go somewhere new this year or get to know some new people this should be a fun time. Email me at projectlutz@yahoo.com if you might be interested.

Nah, not really... just wanted to say hi to everyone!

Well, I've done it. I am now at my goal weight and a very happy 27% body fat percentage. I am currently a size 3, though I expect to lose another size when I get my tummy tuck next month. I am a very very happy camper these days and have more energy that I ever expected.

I heard a rumor that I was thought to have been on the verge of death with a colostomy bag and other nonsense. That's exactly what it is... nonsense. I did have a small complication that was resolved within 6 weeks of surgery but have had no problems since. Even my bloodwork came back great... cholesterol down from 180 to 90.

I started taking Enbrel for my psoriasis. It is a twice a week injection I administer to myself *cringe*. All of you who know me well know how I feel about that whole needle thing, especially when I have no art or jewelry as a consolation prize. I've been breaking out pretty badly this year though so I figured that something's gotta give and finally gave in to my dermatologist. MY first injection was lastnight and I didn't even have to get Alex to do it. I got brave, got determined, and did it myself. Luckily they are 27 Guage needles and I felt like a big old wuss for blowing it out of proportion because I managed it without a bit of pain. Luckily Enbrel is a protein and does not sting going in at all. I took it in my tummy where you don't have as many ouchie nerves. I am happy to report that my psoriasis doesn't seem as angry today as usual. I think I might respond very well to this medication, maybe go into complete remission. It's been a great year for me as far as doing things I needed to do for myself. Maybe I'll even kick this phobia in this whole process.

My bass is being shipped as we speak, due for delivery on the 20th. What a wonderful Christmas present that'll be. Alex is dragging his feet on telling me what he wants. Tick, tock gorgeous. Time's a wastin'.

I need to get my hair trimmed, and maybe change the style. I have met this great hair stylist (still a student but she's almost done and will do it for free to get the practice). I trust her though, and think I'll get her to hook me up with something new very soon. I need to redo my red. I did a rush job a couple weeks ago but couldn't leave the red in for long enough because I was late meeting some folks. It looks good now but is fading fast. MAybe I'll let it go a little longer.

I'd love to get some new clothes (or used clothes that are new to me). I need size 6 and 4 jeans and some long sleeve shirts in small. I'd love a trip to Victoria's Secret, too.

I'd like to get my hair trimmed and re-dye it. I have more than an inch of roots before my fire engine red streaks start and my black underlayer has faded to dark brown.

I'd love to do some modeling (photognome, where are you when I need you?). I think it might help me to adjust to the new (down 88lbs) me to see myself in some pics that aren't done by me and my P.O.S digital cam.

I want a good job in the Athens area doing what I am good at... IT or Telecommunications. 

I wish I had 40lbs of sculpey. I have been getting into sculpting again and while I love working with natural clay I don't have anywhere to fire it around here yet.

I want a massage by a good massage therapist. My center of gravity has changed this year and I feel great but think some good therapeutic massage would put me where I need to be.

Some of the people who I care about most in my life are very distant right now, due to different circumstances. It would be nice to talk to them but more than anything I just wish that they are doing well and finding peace, happiness, and joy this holiday season.

I wish I could go get a pedicure.

I wish Kerry had won. Or better yet, Nader.

I wish I could be closer to a friend of mine who is pregnant right now and be a more attentive friend to her."

"event","Wish List! (From several different sources)

Step One

- Make a post (public, friendslocked, filtered...whatever you're comfortable with) to your LJ. The post should contain your list of 10 holiday wishes. The wishes can be anything at all, from simple and fandom-related (""I'd love a Snape/Hermione icon that's just for me"") to medium (""I wish for _____ on DVD"") to really big (""All I want for Christmas is a new car/computer/house/TV."") The important thing is, make sure these wishes are things you really, truly want.

- If you wish for real life things (not fics or icons), make sure you include some sort of contact info in your post, whether it's your address or just your email address where Santa (or one of his elves) could get in touch with you.

- Also, make sure you post some version of these guidelines in your LJ, or link to this post (it'll be public) so that the holiday joy will spread.

Step Two

- Surf around your friendslist (or friendsfriends, or just random journals) to see who has posted their list. And now here's the important part:

- If you see a wish you can grant, and it's in your heart to do so, make someone's wish come true. Sometimes someone's trash is another's treasure, and if you have a leather jacket you don't want or a gift certificate you won't use--or even know where you could get someone's dream purebred Basset Hound for free--do it. 

You needn't spend money on these wishes unless you want to. The point isn't to put people out, it's to provide everyone a chance to be someone else's holiday elf--to spread the joy. Gifts can be made anonymously or not--it's your call.

There are no rules with this project, no guarantees, and no strings attached. Just...wish, and it might come true. Give, and you might receive. And you'll have the joy of knowing you made someone's holiday special."

If you want to pick on me or say things about me that will upset me then you must pick something that I am insecure about.

#1. WEIGHT
While I still have a long way to go on my weight loss it is a situation that is under control. This time next year you'll still be laughing at how witty you were when you broke into my profile, but I will still be better than any of the trash that drags itself through your bed.

#2. SEX
My sex life is totally under control and exactly where I want it to be. No matter what you say about my supposed promiscuity it really seems that you have missed the point. I am 100% secure with who I sleep with, when and where I do it and why. You can't shake me by trying to insinuate that I am a whore because, unlike you, I have the balls to be honest with myself and my partner and at least conduct myself with a shred of decency. I don't expect you to be able to understand that at all. Honor and decency seemed to have escaped you somewhere in your sad bitter past.

It is sad that this high school drama you try to drag me into has become your hobby.
It is to everyone's benefit that you grow up, and leave me alone.

Keep playing games..... karma is a bitch."

NO GAS DAY on MAY 19!!! 

May 19th is national gas boycott day. With gas prices on the rise, something must be done to send a message to the gas companies. If no one in America buys gas on the 19th the gas companies will lose an estimated $45 MILLION dollars! If you're not happy with paying over $2.00/gallon please do not buy gas on May 19th.

Please re-post this so that it will be able to reach as many people across the country as possible. 


[ A financial expert was on FOX last week explaining how prices are based on estimates, not the actual cost.. and that if we dropped our current system of (I think futures is what he called it?) that the price per barrel would drop between 5 and 7 dollars. not sure what that translates to at the pump but any bit of help would be nice... especially if it eliminates a government/corporate sponsered racket.]"

<lj-cut>
When you first enter the site you will come to what will be our administrative area. This is where check-in etc will happen.

I'd like to state right here right now that we have absolutely no reason to try to go after anyone. We aren't even interested in any retaliation for things that have been done to us. We would simply like to get on with the rest of our lives, and wish that others would do the same. 

I'd like to point out that we have talked to many of the LARPs in the area and have been very open to developing some level of professional relationship with them. This is our business, and in business that is what you do.

But I will not tolerate any more of people breaking into profiles I have on the internet and calling me a slut or talking bad about my children. I will not tolerate anyone slandering me or my family or friends. If you choose to be childish and play these games that is fine, but I don't have time to deal with you. My lawyer, however, has more than enough time and really enjoys this kind of thing. He went to school for it. That's what HE does. And we pay him plenty of money to be really motivated about it. 

I'm done with this. For a while it bothered me. Then it was kind of amusing that anyone was still even worried about us. Now it's just a distraction that I don't have time for and won't deal with anymore. It is out of my hands."

Guy: Hey, can u take my helmet off & put it on? It's bugging me while I'm driving.
**The next day there was a story in the newspaper. A motorcycle had crashed in2 the side of a building because the brakes were shot. There were 2 ppl on that motorcycle, but only 1 had survived. Halfway down the road, the guy realized that his brakes were broken, but he didn't want 2 let the girl kno or else she wuld have been scared. Instead, he had her say she loved him 1 last time & felt her hug 1 last time, then had her wear his helmet so that she wuld live even tho it meant that he wuld die.awWwW"

He don't know how much I need him
He don't know I'd fall apart 
Without his kiss 
Without his touch 
Without his faithful lovin' arms 
He don't know that its all about him 
He don't know I cant live without him 
He's my world he's my everything 
And he thinks he needs me

 Nelly]
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh

[Chorus: Nelly]
Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturin you with him
And it hurts so bad... yeah
Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, I can't shake it no

[Nelly]
I can't wait to see you
Wanna see if you still got that look in your eye
That one you had for me
Before, we, said our goodbyes
And it's a shame that we
Gotta spend our time bein mad about the same things
(Over and over again) about the same thing
(Over and over again)
Ho.. but I think, she's leavin
Aw, man, she's leavin
And, I don't know what else to do

[Tim M] Can't go on not lovin you

[Chorus]

[Nelly]
I remember the day you left
I remember the last breath you took right in front of me
When you said that you would leave
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything
But I see clearly now
And this choice I made keeps playin in my head
(Over and over again) play in my head
(Over and over again)
Ho.. but I think, she's leavin
Aw, man, she's leavin
And, I don't know what else to do

[Tim M] Can't go on not lovin you

[Chorus]

[Nelly]
Now, that I've real-izzzed
That I'mmmm goin dow-hown
From all this pain you've put me through

[Tim M]
Everytime I close my eyes (woo!)
I-hiiii like {?} ohh-hohhh
I can't go on not lovin you

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Nelly]
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh... over and over again, over and over again

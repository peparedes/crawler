"event","hey yallz this entry is about my day... first a psycho bitch named amber gouras called me a dumb ass bitch but if my memory serves me correctly she is the one who has failed her grade 3 times! now who is the dumbass bitch? she thinks that she can have any guy she wants, well recent studies show that tyler mclawhorn said that last weekend while he was dropping amber gouras and jenna bowen off at amber gouras's house she was feeling all up on him n he was like get off of me n shit. well that goes to show that she cant have any guy that she wants along with her flirting with jimmy crawford. they flirt all the time at school but in fact she does have a boyfriend names ben whose last name is unknown. ben who's last name is unknown is ugly n this statement has been heard from many people that have seen him. also tyler mclawhorn has infact told my brother mathew windham that amber gouras is ugly. therefore she cannot be the queen of beauty or have the guys she wants! alot of guys i have in fact met that have seen or know her or of her say that they would never be caught dead with amber gouras. she also thinks that she is a bad ass n can hurt ppl jus as to look at them well i offered her a chance to rpove that as of yesterday but amber gouras denied that invitation. i have recently found out that if amber gouras did hit me then she could possibly go to jail for assault. well i wouldn't call the cops on her, i would probably call an ambulance first. considering that shawn hardy told me hisself that i would probably win the fight anyway. she also told my brother yesterday that she couldn't do anything with me because of my being soo young, well i am 13 years old and will be 14 next monday. considering this i say that i am not young and have been told by many people that i have acted more mature that alot of 16 year old people like amber gouras who told me yesterday to have fun playing with my brother. but yet amber gouras told me also that she wasnt going to behave in this childish behavior. now when you comment please tell me who is the child n who is the mature adult n please feel free to put anything you would like to add. back to the not being able to do anything with me, she told my brother that she wasnt trying to hang out with him b/c she needed a ride because when she is not with me she doesnt need a ride because she can drive a jeep anywhere she wants to go. well if that is true then why was tyler mclawhorn dropping her and jenna bowen off last weekend? on the bus this afternoon she talks about halling off and hitting me in my fucking face well she had her chance yesterday but she didnt. she also called my brother ugly and dumb but yet i will say it again that amber gouras would be graduating next year if she hadnt failed the 8th grade three times. now once again i will ask: who is the dumb ass bitch now huh? amber or me? who is the fucking pussy? amber gouras or me? please leave all your thoughts and comments on this topic and if you have anything major to tell me you can reach me on aol at this sn: cloudsoflullaby4"

"event","<P>to continue what i wrote last nite... something was wrong and i mean the day all stared out fine, we weren't in an arguement all day. we go outside and start talking and then he says something i can't remember what exactly but it pissed me off! so he started walking to his car like he was gonna leave so i let him go as the old sayin goes ""if you love something, you have to let it go"" well he didn't leave, he just sat in his car and listened to music and i finnally calmed down and then i walked over to him and told him i thought he'd been gone by now and then he asked me y i was about to let him leaveand then i told him the old sayin that i was abiding by. he was talking about how he didn't know what to do n e more and i just listened and almost started crying then my mom came outside and told me to come in. she told me in the bathroom that my brother heard a snotty comment he made earlier and that it was all he could do not to kick his ass. then that set me off i was already pissed and then hearing that made it worse so i was like the hulk. i was tired of the attitude he had, i was sick of being the one who was trying to keep peace i exploded like mt st hellens! i stood in that kitchen and would not let him leave until he told me what was wrong and why he had gotten the attitude he had and that where ever he had gotten it from he was to give it back b/c i was not gonna deal with it n e more so he said fine i'll leave let me go i told him i wasn't going to until he told me what was buggin him and what i had done wrong and how i could fix it and then he grabbed me by my bicepts and threw me in the living room and walked out. i had fell on the couch and i picked myself up and walked in my room and slammed the door. my mom came in and asked me what was wrong and then i couldn't help but start bawling, i started screaming things like i am tired of his bullshit! and other things but i never could identify what was the main problem, just the little ones. i threw myself on the bed and just cried and i tried to calm down but the usual wouldn't work not again not this time. i ate my comfort foods, listened to music, everything, nothing helped i tried everything that i could. i finnally calmed down enough to call some of my friends, i couldn't talk. i ended up going to the living room and watched the recruit with my brother.&nbsp;</P>

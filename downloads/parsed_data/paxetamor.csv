<b>Saturday evening</b> 

I went to a club. 'Old Fashion Cafe'. I had heard of it-- supposedly it was notorious for its great techno music. Well, that vague assumption led me to a place that most definitely was not my crowd. High class [<i>like the name didn't hint it</i>], homogenous and-- worst of all-- its own little world. It reminded me of the orgiastic scenes described in Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby.  Rather than experiencing the story through the eyes of an 'objective' narrator, however, I was experiencing it through my own. Man, how I despised it. What made it worse was the fact that the occasional ASM student would be buzzing around. I don't know, I don't like it when the world is a small place. Luckily, my friends shared the same sentiment, and we skidaddled off early into the night time abyss.

<b>Sunday</b>
'06 Graduation. 'Nuff said.

<b>Sunday evening</b>
I went to my friend's birthday. Heh, was pretty frightened to go, to be honest. I thought I would be surrounded by flaming homosexuals. Not that I have anything against them-- I'm bisexual. I just don't like big crowds of people, as it can take away from the personal sentiment between the people there. Lucky for me, he brought only a few friends. They were great. They were sociable. They were pretty. But...I didn't fit in. I really got to work on that confidence stuff, huh? I'm already working on my posture! :D Hopefully by the end of this summer I'll be looking straight than rather at an angle.

Monday and Tuesday are a great big blur. Plus, I wont bore you with narrative shit.

On a lighter note:

World Lit: 6
English Oral presentation: 6
Math: 7

How cool is that?

I musn't forget: <i> I got to get to know a really awesome dude named Zach. This is my shout out to you. : )"

"event","I think the only possible way to get meaning out of life is to search for the relevancy and-- more so-- experience it. It's not just a matter of 'knowing that it exists', such a mindframe CAN leave us to be dreary and disinterested in what we do everyday. 

Hmm...A year ago today my Zio (my uncle) passed away. This important day drives me down to memory lane and seriously causes a need to reflect and assess how I live my life. I know for a fact that I take so much for granted and I have become so unaware of what I do. Things, in my mind, all seem habitual. Perhaps I just need a push in the right direction, a spark that will enlighten my observations. Nonetheless, I shall not winge about it-- better to get up and DO something about it, aye? ; )

The other day I bought some well nice clothes. I figured that if I'm going to America for the summer, I want to stock up on some EU fashion that would make my friends drool. Hahaha...Silly thought, and very unlike me! Ah well...I can have a little fun, can't I?"

"event","Here I am, sitting in my commodious, yet messy room, sipping on a fruit smoothie and thinking, ""what next?""

My 11th grade year is coming to a conclusion. The other day I had my English oral presentation and gave in my World lit-- that wraps up IB English Y1. My first initial thoughts were something on the lines of ""FUCK YES!"", slowly shifting over to ""oh shit.""

Any ending has initiatory value to it and -- in my case-- this 'value' would be the university application process. Now, unlike the US, the UK universities require a decision and dedication to your desired course BEFORE you go there. Personally, I quite like this system. I feel it gives me more of an opportunity to explore in depth my chosen area of study for three years and prepare me for its vocational/practical application. However, sad fact is, I don't know what I want to study.

First it was science, but then I found it too repetitive.

Then came graphic design, but alas, too superficial.

Then fine art, but how much impact can I really have?

Perhaps development studies, or journalism, or social policy? I want to get involved with the people and make a change for the betterment of humanity. It's so difficult to figure out how to, though..."

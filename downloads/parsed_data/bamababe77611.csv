"event","Hey what did I do? 
I've spoken too soon 
Listen to this tune 
Forget the words 
Wait until someday 
'Cause when I know what to say 
I'll say it in the best way you've ever heard 

I know that you don't need nobody 
Are you sure you're that sure about me? 

Young and with no clue 
I still wanna love you 
Give credit where it's due 
I've got good taste 
It's not like I wanna get married 
I never asked you to kiss me 
Just don't want you to be sorry you didn't try"

What would you do if 19 and 8 dated?

"event","The past few years I've outlined the months and told my favorite memories... here goes.  Woot for 2005.

JANUARY: Brought in the New Year with West Huntsville.  We sang... and blew bubbles.  It was quite amusing.

FEBRUARY:  Valentine's party at John and Mary Annes... went ice skating and gave Josh a surprise birthday party.  That day wasn't the funnest ever for certain reasons... but that's the only event I can remember from February.

MARCH:  Turned the big 18.  Ate at Westtown with Jennifer and went to see the musical?  Something like that.  Then that weekend Jessica, Jennifer and I had a sleepover... late that night we went to walmart and met Chad... THEN he came back with us and ate oreo pie and played uno.

APRIL:  Prom.  Prom was so much fun.  Dave was a pretty good date.  No complaints there.  Afterwards we threw Jess a surprise catwoman bday party.  It was the even of the season.  Then everyone accidently fell asleep and stayed the night at my house.

MAY:  Good Riddance to West Forsyth.  Graduation was wonderful.  I didn't trip or make a fool of myself.  That night a bunch of us went to Jessica's house and just hung out.  Good times.

JUNE:  Uhhh... May/June was about the time me and Dave dated, or whatever you wanna call it.  I think I went to Alabama late June.

JULY:  CAMP!!! It was my last year as a camper! :(  I was captin of the green team.  Hoorah.  Timmy came with me... hopefully he'll keep coming back. I think he will.

AUGUST:  College.  Moved in and was thankful for having a sane roommate. haha.  Interface = ok.  Fell on my butt in front of the entire student body.

SEPTEMBER:  Rush/Hypnotist.  The night that the hypnotist came was hilarious.  Some people from WH came that weekend... That weekend me, Vito, and Nik hung out a whoooole lot.  Fun times.  I think the Psi Mu retreat was in September too...

OCTOBER:  Halloween.  I was a witch.. how lame.  Abbey was an Umpa Loopa.  SO funny.  We trickortreated and then went to watch the ring in the middle of a field.

NOVEMBER:  Took a trip with Nik and Abbey.  Went to Gadsden and Huntsville.  Spent Thanksgiving week with Grandma and Pop.  Vitarelli spent a few days with me in Huntsville before goin back to school.

DECEMBER:  Took finals... BLAH.  Spent a little over a week in NC.  Hung out with some important people... came back to Huntsville and rang in the New Year with Brett, Brenon, Alyssa and Timmy."

"event","Something about this place makes me wish I was in love.  I guess I feel a void whenever I'm at home.  It makes me want to fall back into something that I know isn't for me.  The phrase ""in love with being in love"" comes to mind.  

I'm thankful for Freed-Hardeman.  I really hope I don't screw myself over and have to come home.  Like always I've had plenty of time to evaluate things and over-analyze.  I'm not going to say that I'm completely content with not having a boyfriend, but I don't think about it nearly as much when I'm at school.  I let other things take that place... and that's the way it should always be.  

I've been pretty level-headed about relationship business while at school.  I'm not looking for Mr. Right Now anymore, although I'm sure I could have one.  I do like someone.. I'm not head-over-heels for them though.  Which is good, because it's not healthy to fall for someone who hasn't fallen for you.  He's become one of my best friends, and I'm certainly not going to push for something that may not be there on his end.  

I've set standards for my future spouse, yet none of them are physical standards since I don't feel I have the right to do so.  If they DO happen to be taller and I DO happen to fit in their arms.. major bonus points. Haha.  Yeah, I have no clue where any of that came from.  Disregard if you feel the need.

SO, pretty sure I have the exact same new years resolutions as I have the past 5ish years.  Also, pretty sad that I haven't really followed them through yet.  Maybe it's stupid to even make a resolution, seeing that I haven't ever kept one.  We shall see.  I do know that if I don't keep atleast one of them, I'll be saying hello to Winston-Salem again.

I've been home for about a week and 2 days.  I'm going back to Huntsville tomorrow evening.  Normally I'd be excited about going back.  I'm just disappointed that I can't spend more time with mom and a few other people.  There are also some people who I haven't hung out with at all... so I'm bummed about that.  Anywho, I will spend the next 2 weeks in Huntsville.  Being bored because 1) I'm broke, as usual and 2) pretty sure most of my friends have jobs and won't be free during the daytime.  I reckon I'll spend a few days taking down all of Grandma's Christmas decorations.  Then I'll clean the house.  That'll keep me busy for a while, I'm sure.

Good news.  Alex Vizcaino is coming to Freed this semester.  I'm super excited.  He's a sweetheart!  I'm glad we'll get to be closer friends.  It'll also be nice to have a piece of Warners with me.  (and rides home! haha)

Christmas was a good one.  I got a digital camera, a straightener, and a phone for my room from mom and dad.  Timmy got me this eye shadow set that has like 96 different shades, or something crazy like that. And Grammie and Granddaddy got me a copier/scanner/printer.  :)  And for Christmas dinner we had prime rib and the greatest cheesecake ev-er.  Yes, I'm a fat kid, and I am NOT looking forward to Gano. Haha.

I think I'm all typed-out.  I hope all of you had a happy Christmas, and I wish all of you a wonderful New Year.

Jennifer, Alex, and Jess, I had so much fun with y'all this week.  I'm going to miss you like woah."

I've seriously decided I want to be a pastry chef.  I'm not even joking.. But I won't be.. because I'm at Freed, and so help me I'm staying there and I'm gonna be the best teacher ever.  And I'll decorate cakes as a side job.

I got to Huntsville Wednesday night.  I want to go back already.  I miss all my friends.  Dad is coming tomorrow... I'll be arriving at home Tuesday or Wednesday.  Then I'll come back to Huntsville around new years for 2 weeks of pure boredom.

Next semester I'm gonna do better.  I'm gonna actually write my papers and I'm gonna let go of certain things.  I'm giving up coke. (the drink, not the drug! hah.)  I'm gonna start praying and studying more.

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>On the other hand I've been spending the majority of my time with Nik the past few weeks.&nbsp; I'm sure that the whole campus thinks there's something going on between us.&nbsp; Honestly, I don't know how to feel about him.&nbsp; Sometimes I think it would never work... and other times I want to date him.&nbsp; He's sarcastic, witty, ohso intelligent, and makes it his daily job to make fun of me.&nbsp; Sounds familiar doesn't it?&nbsp; He'll call me in the afternoons and once all the normal chit chat is done, we sit in the most comfortable silence until one of us figures out what to do for the rest of the day.&nbsp; He never calls me Ashley.&nbsp; It's usually Payne, House, or Ashley Brooke.&nbsp; There is so much behind this front he puts up though.&nbsp; He amazes me.</P>

"event","Last week was midterms, therefore I had a ton of studying and homework to do.  I was so stressed out by Friday afternoon that I couldn't see straight.. which makes no sense because by that time all the tests and such were over.  Friday afternoon I was certain that I had failed my bible test and Abbey had decided at the last minute to go on the retreat with Vitarelli and I had a million pound package to pick up.  I was just gonna leave it there this weekend but mom called and was flipping out because she paid extra so i'd have it this weekend.  I ended up going to get it.  I got sort of depressed because everyone was either going home or going on the retreat. Then I perked up a little because I remembered Lauren was gonna be here too.  And I needed sleep like woah.  So Friday night we walked to the chinese place to eat dinner.. then we went to gano and used one of our meals just to get desert.  Heck yes.  We just hung out in my room all night.  Then we went to devo. 

Saturday I slept til 11.  I really didn't do much Saturday but it was relaxing.. and that's what I needed.  I showered and met Mary Anne's parents and talked to them for a few.  Ate leftover chinese with Lauren then went to Walmart with Justin...  Came back and washed clothes... Ate dinner with James and Lauren.... washed more clothes... went to devo.. and this is where my weekend turned from good to WONDERFUL.

First I have to tell the story of Garrett.  SO I know that Freed-Hardeman isn't exactly a huge school.. but I'm dead serious when I say that ever since the first day of school... I'd see Garrett everywhere.  I have no classes with this kid, and me and my friends are hardly consistant in times in which we go eat and such.  Everywhere I went, there he was... and none of this was planned on either side I'm sure.  So, I was really intrigued by this guy simply because I saw him all the time.  A few weeks into school there was a talent show.. he sang and played the piano.  He has the most gorgeous voice. AHH.  Anyway, a few weeks after that we had homecoming elections and he got elected to be a representative.  A day or two after that I found him on facebook.  I didn't friend him or anything I just sent him a message saying he did a good job at the talent show and congtats on homecoming.  SO, he friended me.  This was about 3 weeks ago I guess.  I still continued to see him all the time... THEN last Thursday when I was walking to class he caught up with me and introduced himself and asked if I was Ashley because he recognized my facebook picture.  So we talked for a few minutes...  I didn't really talk to him again all last week.. we waved at eachother a few times..  OK.  BACK TO LAST NIGHT'S DEVO.  He came up to me and just started talking.  And we talked for a good thirty minutes.  Then he asked me and Lauren if we wanted to go to church with him this morning.  So we did.  And he is wonderful.  And I barely know him.. but so far it's been creepy how everything just fits together.  This morning when I was getting ready, I was listening to Gavin Degraw.  I get into his car and he's listening to the same thing.  He played his favorite song on the album, which also happens to be one of my favorites.  I put my glasses on during church this morning and he looked over at me and said he liked them. Haha.  So, I really don't know this kid.  He seems so sweet and nice though.  I really hope I get the chance to get to know him better.  One of our mutual friends, Heather, has been talking to both of us.  And he's told her that I'm really sweet and he'd like to get to know me... which is what I've been telling her.  We're both on the same page and that's a good thing.

This weekend has rocked my socks."

"event","Nik can be described as a black woman trapped in a dorky white man's body.  99.9% of the time, he acts like this.  It's hilarious for a while...  I've had 2 really deep conversations with this kid, and some semi-serious random talks.  Most of our conversations include the words and phrases: ""you's a crazy cracka"" ""is you out yo mind?"" ""po baby"" ""whateva"" and ""faggot.""  We have a lot in common.  So much in common, it's a little on the scary side.  He beat my butt TWICE at checkers at Cracker Barrel Sunday afternoon.  I got mad (not really)... I'm usually the checker champion.  I met Nik the first week of school when we were put into the same group in history class to do some stupid skit. I sit next to him in history.. and today when we got our tests back we both got a 96 (only because he cheated off me, ok- not really again).  I drew a humorous picture of him during class the other day.. he balled it up and threw it at my head.  He has a shirt that says ""I lack the motivation gene.""  I can relate with that. Last night he gave me the best hug I've recieved since I got here.  I can wear heels and still be his height.  He has a worse southern accent than me, and I love it.  He's from Alabama.  Enough said.  He wears glasses...  He's sarcastic and witty.  He only got that way because his grandma got sick, and he wasn't that popular with the ladies in high school.  In reality he can be quite the gentleman.  He goes for girls who are unlike me.  Much unlike me.  His cd's are full of 60's, 70's and be-bop music.  He bought an Elvis CD in walmart the other night.  He stayed out until curfew and got a bad parking space just to make sure I was ok.  He was in love with some retard who is now in FL getting high and drunk.  He's worried to death about her, but knows she's not the one for him.  He can also the chewbaca sound.  Quite a talent.  He loves to sing.  When we sit next to eachother.. we're really close.. and when we bump into eachother neither of us say sorry, because it is understood.  My most difficult classes fall on MWF, but those are my favorite days.. and I think it's only because I have History on those days.  He has a contagious laugh.  One thing I have yet to find out... why the heck does he spell his name Nik and not Nick?

I seriously have no clue why I just typed all that out.  Probably because I haven't told anyone here... And also because I think he isn't interested."

"event","So, I was supposed to go to Wal-Mart with Nick this afternoon.. but my lack of cell phone screwed me over on that.  Whatever.

Let me just say that I really like it here.  I'm so stress-free.  It's a strange feeling.  I don't have to call mom and dad and ask to do anything.  I don't have an 11pm curfew.  My classes are pretty easy so far.  That being said, the only grades I have are daily grades for English Comp and a memory verse quiz for Bible (of which I Aced).  After I have a few tests, I might not feel the same way.. haha.  We shall see.

I've met quite a few new people.. and made a few friends.. not that many.. but a few..  You really don't realize how valuable a cell phone is until you've had one and lost one.  I have no cell phone service on campus.  People call other people and are like... ""yo, what is up home g??  wanna go chill in the student center/ go to walmart/ sit on the swings/ go to gano/ fill in the blank..?""  Hmm.  So, it is time like these when I'm in my dorm doing nothing.. and I'm sure there is someone I know doing to same thing.... but can they call me?  Heck no.

Ok, done with the cell phone rambling...

So, there are basically two guys of whom I talk to here on a regular basis.  Justin and Nick.  There are many guys I am watching from afar and am too afraid to introduce myself to them. (ok, so that last sentence made me sound like a stalker... i'm not.. i promise.. haha) A few of them are in the social club I plan to join.. so that problem will be solved eventually.  I don't really have a crush on anyone yet.  Out of all the guys I've talked to, I can't tell which ones to like.  They're all christian.. they're all super gentlemanly and nice.  I enjoy hangin out with Justin.  I don't think there's anything there though... And Nick just cracks me up.  I sit next to him in History and we hang out quite frequently.  Last Wednesday night we had a good talk.. not about anything in particular.. but, it was just good... get what I'm sayin? haha.. I'm still figuring that boy out.  Ok, so I MIGHT have a tiny thing for Nick.  I'm not rushing into anything though.

I'm very happy that I decided not to cut my hair.  I've found that Henderson, TN makes my hair frizz like crazy.  Yes, curly haired Ashley has made a come back.  You know you like it.  :-P

I love my roommate.  So far we're getting along great.  I know we've only been here 3 weeks, but things are good. 

I had an embarrassing moment the other night.  It was hilarious...  Let me set the scene for you:
Every night at 10:30 there is an optional campus-wide devotional.  Most nights, the majority of the students decide to attend, and this night was no exception.  We have the devo in the commons.  The commons are basically some huge concrete steps and a hill on either side.  Abbey, my roommate, and I were like a few minutes late.  Naturally, the steps were full, so we decided to walk down the very steep, wet, grassy hill to sit on the concrete in front.  Oh yes, you know where this is going.  Half-way down the hill I slip and fall right on my butt.  The funny thing is that Abbey lost her balance and almost fell the same time that I did.  She was the lucky one.  Haha.  So, I've fallen on my butt and decide that I'm just gonna sit there.  So I put my hands on my knees and try to play it off.  Abbey sits down beside me and the whole time we are cracking up.  It was more humorous to me than embarrassing.  Strange, huh?  Anyway.. basically the whole school saw me and were laughing, not only because I fell, but because I played it off so well and even laughed at myself.  All my friends came up to me and laughed and complimented me afterwards.  People I didn't even know came up to me and complimented on how well I played it off.

And on that note, I'm leaving.

I miss you."

Our seats weren't all that great... but it was still cool.  They had those huge screens so you could see everything anyway, ya know?

"event","Have you ever just set back and thought about all the people that have come and gone in your life?  Do you remember who you were best friends with in elementary and middle school?  What about early high school?  Are any of them still in your life?  I've been thinking about that a lot lately.  I always think about it when I see the musical.  I think about how me and Carlos were so close... and sometimes I miss being the way we were.  It was so long ago though.  And you know... it's always a gradual thing.  First you stop hanging out that much, you stop talking on the phone, you stop talking on the internet, sometimes you'll wave at them at school or in a public place... then after a while... you don't even do that.  You pass by them and don't even give them a second glance.  Your past with them is frozen over... like they never existed in the first place.  Have you ever thought about that?  Does it depress you like it does me?  And now things are so far gone, they're not fixable.  We've got like 2 1/2 months left.. and we're not gonna (well, i won't) see any of these people again.  What's worse is when a friendship just ends... it doesn't hurt as much when it's gradual.  Either way, it's a sucky thing to deal with.

MySN77611: how are you
Titan165: I'm dandy, you?
MySN77611: i'm alright..
MySN77611: whats been up lately...
MySN77611: you never talk to me..
MySN77611: you don't even wave anymore
MySN77611: ??
Titan165: Well, I hardly see you anymore
Titan165: It's hard to wave when I don't see you.
MySN77611: you see me nearly everyday
MySN77611: at lunch
MySN77611: and you walk right by
MySN77611: i know atleast some days you HAVE to see me
MySN77611: and kerry said you decided not to talk to me anymore
MySN77611: why is that
Titan165: Well, I don't mean to, I guess I really just don't see you.
MySN77611: i have a strange feeling its more than that
Titan165: I just never see you and I'm hardly on line, so really, I don't talk to you anymore
MySN77611: even the last few times i've tried to talk to you
Titan165: Well, what kind of feeling do you have?
MySN77611: you act weird
MySN77611: i'm not sure what it is
MySN77611: but someing IS weird
Titan165: Well, I honestly don't think I'm acting weird
MySN77611: why'd you tell kerry you were ""phasing me out""
MySN77611: and i tried really hard to talk to you during senior day... and you didn't care
MySN77611: so, something must me be up
MySN77611: i'm sorry if i did something wrong i'm not aware of
MySN77611: i still mean everything i told you... i still <3 my donny
MySN77611: i mean, i called you a few times... i really was trying to get close with you again
MySN77611: and you havent been receptive
Titan165: You're right...something is different...but I don't know what it is and I'm sure it's not any or our faults but I don't feel close to you as before
MySN77611: as before what
Titan165: before everything, we've just drifted beyond the point of return in my opinion
Titan165: and this doesn't have to do with me being gay or any of that stuff with me and alex
Titan165: i just can't pinpoint it
Titan165: our relationship has just been going downhill for the longest time and idk if you've recognized that, but I have
MySN77611: yeah, i have... and everytime i tried to fix it, tried to call you, tried to hang with you... you shrugged me off
MySN77611: so there must have been something wrong anyway
MySN77611: it was like you told me... then you pushed me away
MySN77611: i thought that after that we'd get closer again.. and i tried for a while... but like i said.
MySN77611: yeah, we were going downhill.. but i can pinpoint that night is when you completely cut me off
Titan165: idk what to say
MySN77611: then i guess it's all true
Titan165: what's all true?
MySN77611: i dont know why you decide to tell me something like that when you're just gonna cut me off anyway
Titan165: Cause you deserved to know from me.
MySN77611: if we're so grown apart, why did it matter?
Titan165: Cause you deserved to hear it from me than from some random person later on
MySN77611: you don't spill your heart out to someone you dont care about
Titan165: um yeah...all i told you was that i was gay...what about that is spilling my heart?
MySN77611: why did you tell me
MySN77611: if you didn't care about me and you being friends anymore?
Titan165: you are making no sense
Titan165: all i wanted was for you to find out i was gay from ME
Titan165: that's it
Titan165: no spilling my heart or anything
MySN77611: alright then
Titan165: i tell random people I'm gay
MySN77611: i wish you the best.
Titan165: thank you.

So, I started crying.  This isn't Donny anymore.  His typing had no enthusiasm or personality.  He didn't call me Babsy.  I seriously felt like I was talking to one of the instant message robots like SmarterChild, or SantaClaus, or something.  ...On senior day, he was one of the group leaders or whatever, so he had to carry that sign.. and when I walked by him, I started goofing off and singing, ""I SAW THE SIIIIIGN!! AND IT OPENED UP MY EYES, I SAW THE SIIIGN!!!""  Yeah, he didn't even crack a smile.  He's not Donny anymore.  And when I talked to him today, I felt like he didn't care AT ALL.  Is that the impression you got as well?"

"event","So, Kathleen and Lincoln broke up.  This really depresses me for some reason.  I mean, this was the couple everyone and their mom thought were going to get married.  And I know Kat HAS to be devestated.  I would be.  Lincoln is like one of the best guys I've ever met.  Maybe it's a good thing we never worked out, because I never had to lose him.  She really must be miserable.  That's such a sucky feeling.










I need a boy.  I probably won't find one that will fully accept me though.  You know what Dave said the other night ""Ashley, you'd be the perfect girlfriend, you're just too TALL for me.. You're so beautiful though.""  HAH.  Too tall, huh?  I'm sure that's it.  And it doesn't matter, because I don't like Dave... that would be way too weird.  But it's the same thing with everyone... ""You're the marrying type.""  ""Jonathan likes Asians and little chicks.""  SCREW IT.  It is so stupid for me to love people despite their appearence when they aren't willing to do the same for me.  Good grief.  Am I that horrible looking?  ""You're like my best friend Ashley.""  That's all I am.  The best friend-- maybe good enough for marrying WAY down the road because they know I'll be faithful but not good enough for right now.  What does Dave know anyway?  He doesn't even TALK to Jonathan anymore.  But of course that doesn't matter either because Jonathan doesn't go to church much as of late.  Blah.

Sometimes, I just want someone to hold my hand, to hug me, to hold me...  Doesn't everyone??  For as long as I can remember I've had to hold my own darn hand and I'm tired of it."

<P><lj-cut text=""the four day extravaganza""> </P>
<P>Wednesday mom and dad dropped me off at Grammie's before they left for Ohio.&nbsp; I went into the kitchen and mom had left me a bunch of balloons and flowers.&nbsp; I was so surprised.&nbsp; No one has ever given me flowers before.&nbsp; They were pretty.&nbsp; She gave me $40 in a card.&nbsp; Woot Woot.&nbsp; Then Dave came over and picked me up... we went to church... and afterwards he came over and just hung out.&nbsp; Fun stuff.&nbsp; He wouldn't let me touch his hair.&nbsp; I was sad. lol... anywho.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I turned 18.&nbsp; Legality!&nbsp; WOOHOO.&nbsp; Yeah, not so exciting.&nbsp; Mom called me before school and sang happy bday to me, and I talked to dad and timmy for a minute.&nbsp; Sarah gave me a little birthday note after 1st period.&nbsp; Then, in 3rd period, Katelyn Courson gave me some cupcakes!&nbsp; She made them especially for me.&nbsp; That was so cool of her.&nbsp; She's a sweety.&nbsp; So, I proceeded to pass out cupcakes to my friends until they were gone.&nbsp; I got tired of carrying them around.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; My good friend and boo jessica gave me this awesome card.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; :-D&nbsp; Too bad my real present wouldn't fit in her <a href=""car%20amp"" onmouseover=""window.status='car.&'; return true;"" onmouseout=""window.status=''; return true;"">car.&</a>;nbsp; Grammie gave me $35 and a card.&nbsp; After school Jennifer came over and picked me up.&nbsp; We went to eat at WestTown with dave.&nbsp; I had some noodley stuff.&nbsp; It was yummy.&nbsp; Dave gave me some birthday pie too.&nbsp; Jennifer gave me some of this smelly stuff from <a href=""bath%20and%20body%20works"" onmouseover=""window.status='bath and body works'; return true;"" onmouseout=""window.status=''; return true;"">bath and body works</a> and a <a href=""gift%20card"" onmouseover=""window.status='gift card'; return true;"" onmouseout=""window.status=''; return true;"">gift card</a> to icing.&nbsp; :-D.&nbsp; CARBO THE ALIEN IS AWESOME!!&nbsp; After eating we went to see the musical, Anything Goes.&nbsp; IT WAS GREAT.&nbsp; It was the best thing since West Side Story.&nbsp; I loved it.&nbsp; Everyone did such a great job.&nbsp; :)</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>School was just same ol' same ol'.&nbsp; The only thing I remember about school is that Carlos hugged me.&nbsp; It was weird... but familiar.&nbsp; Haha, I miss the way we used to be sometimes.&nbsp; He was a good friend in middle school... Anywho.&nbsp;&nbsp; After school me and Jessica went to my house, then her house, then to Mcallisters to eat.&nbsp; Then we got her dress from lay away at David's Bridal.&nbsp; THEN we went to the mall and I got a second peircing in my ear.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; </P>
<P>So, I REALLY like Jonathan... a lot.&nbsp; haha.&nbsp; I've always had a thing for him.&nbsp; Well, we decided to go to the dollar store and we spotted his car.&nbsp; So we bought some glow in the dark letters and wrote HEY JONATHAN on his windshield.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; He was in the comic <a href=""book%20store"" onmouseover=""window.status='book store'; return true;"" onmouseout=""window.status=''; return true;"">book store</a> playing some dorky card game.&nbsp; We went in there to see him and he jumped out of his chair to see us.&nbsp; I think he was happy to see us.&nbsp; Anywho, he proceeded to tell us that he's in a band called Thin Hips and that he wanted to hang out, but had to get up early for band practice.&nbsp; Haha.&nbsp; He plays the <a href=""bass%20guitar"" onmouseover=""window.status='bass guitar'; return true;"" onmouseout=""window.status=''; return true;"">bass guitar</a>.&nbsp; That's hot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we left there and went to cook out to get milk shakes.&nbsp; And we went to Jessi's house again.. and back here for the night.&nbsp; We stayed up til about 2... i forgot what we were doing... </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We woke up around 11ish... then we had brunch.&nbsp; It consisted of french toast, corn dogs, <a href=""french%20fries"" onmouseover=""window.status='french fries'; return true;"" onmouseout=""window.status=''; return true;"">french fries</a>.. and coke.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; We rock.&nbsp; Jennifer came over later... we went to the mall... we went to eat at Monte Dey Reys.&nbsp; Went to kmart... and me and jessica popped our collars and were wearing these trucker lookin hats that said ""flawless.""&nbsp; Good times.&nbsp; :-D...&nbsp; We eventually made it back home after a little detour...&nbsp; Lately I've been talkin to one of Dave's friends named Chad.&nbsp; He seemed pretty cool and I thought he might like Jessica.&nbsp; So we talked Chad into meeting us at Wal-Mart.&nbsp; We got there at about 11:45 and stayed about an hour.. then he came back home with us.&nbsp; We put candles in my birthday oreo pie.&nbsp; They sang to me... and we ate.&nbsp; Yum.&nbsp; Chad hung out til about 3:30.&nbsp; He even played Uno with us.&nbsp; I was impressed.&nbsp; Anywho, I think him and Jessica hit it off.&nbsp; It was a good good night.&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This morning, we were dead tired.&nbsp; So we just went to worship.&nbsp; Afterwards we went to McDonalds.&nbsp; Woo hoo.&nbsp; I am SICK of eating out.&nbsp; Now me and Jess are sittin here... chillin like the villians we are.&nbsp; About to go church it up again.&nbsp; Our final copies of our paper are due tomorrow.&nbsp; I'll be up all night fixing my rough draft.... and just one week and one day left until the GLORIOUS spring break.&nbsp; Life is so good right now.&nbsp; Well, most parts of it anyway.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; If I could just get myself a little buddy holly lookin dude, i'll be skraight.&nbsp; Haha.</P>"

"event","The past few weeks at school have sucked majorly... but outside of school things have been good.  Dad's been nice to me and Timmy and I have been getting along a TINY bit better... which doesn't say much, but it IS better. haha..  Last night me, mom, and dad went to Texas Roadhouse for my birthday since they're going to be out of town on my bday.  It was tasty.  Mom got me an mp3 player as an early present.  It's pretty awesome.  I downloaded the songs of us singing at camp from lincolnchurch.org.  And when I lie in my bed with my eyes closed listening to it, I almost feel like I'm there.  Yeah, yeah... strange.. but it makes me feel really serene.  I've been spending a lot of time with Jessica and some with Jennifer.  I <3 them.  Me and Dave have gotten pretty close lately too.  I know Dave is out there... but he's turning out to be a pretty good friend.  I like it that way.  

Once again I've gotten Spring/Summer fever and I can't stop thinking about Alabama.  I called Spencer last night.. for no real reason.  I'd forgotten how much I missed the big goofball.  We talked for a about 20ish minutes, and we could have talked longer but he had to get back to work.  He works at a movie theater and is one of the managers.  I'm impressed.  That's not bad for a guy without a GED.  That has been the one thing that always bothered me about Spence.  He didn't finish high school.  And it's not because he's not smart...  I'm sure if it weren't for that we may have gone on a few dates by now.  He's such a sweetheart and he's the only guy that's ever called me beautiful for no reason (except for dave).  He didn't say I was beautiful because I was all fixed up, or because we were going on a date, or because he was my boyfriend and felt obligated to say it.  He told me I was beautiful just because and said he was surprised that no one here is interested in me.  I still have that email..  It was years ago...  He might come down here in April for the next Ron Boy.  I hope he does.  

There are 3 guys that I have met that I could talk all night long with.  Spencer (we've had MANY all-night chats), Dave, and Alex.  At one point in time Lincoln and I could have talked all night.. we couldn't now of course.  I really love that though.  I love that I'm able to have a connection with someone where I'm comfortable enough to talk to them all night long.  I won't marry anyone unless they have that quality.

I'm super excited about Freed-Hardeman.  I'm going to be away from here!  And I'm going to be around christians 24/7!  And maybe I'll meet some guys... I mean it can't be that hard... I was there one night and someone asked for my phone number... And if I were a single woman then, I probably would have given him the number.  I can't wait to live in my closet-of-a-dorm!!!  I can't wait to be in a social club and go on retreats... Ahhhh! I'm just so excited.  I hope things work out to where I can go.  I'm gonna be so happy that Huntsville is only 2 hours away.  I'll get to see all the people there more often.  :-D Yay Yay Yay!!!  I'll get to go see grandma and talk with her... I'll get to see Jessica... and Kinsley and Jordan.  :-D  I really just can't wait.  I'm not scared at all.

I've been pondering a lot... as you can see... And for some reason last night I was thinking about my best day ever... I have a few...

The sophomore year trip to Carowinds was so great.  I will never ever forget it.  Me, Jnnfr and Jessi walking around SOAKED singing oldies.  Man, things were so simple then.  Chocolate funnel cakes, spin me right round baby.... :)

The monte sano day.  I used to think about that day quite often.  Me and Lincoln and Rochelle spent the ENTIRE day together... and there were sparks between me and linc.  Anyone there can testify to that.  I KNOW that if i didn't have to go home, something would have happened with that.  Melissa and Rochelle said they were constantly trying to get our attention that night, but Lincoln and I were so consumed in eachother, neither of us noticed.  I've only felt that feeling once or twice.  Lincoln still means a lot to me.  I'm pretty sure him and Kat are gonna get married... wow, thats crazy to think about. haha... But I'm over it.  He's a good guy.  She's lucky.  But I will never fling another scrunchie without thinking of him. :K

The Halloween party of 2003.  The 80's ladies rocked the par-tay! haha.  That was so much fun.  It was the night I got to know Dave and Jonathan a little better.  Me and Anna started getting close around that time also.  The haunted house we went to was SO much better than the one this year.  That was a good day/night.

I am quite sure that I've had a best day ever with Alex too. But all that is tainted now.. and one event doesn't stick out over another right now either.  So, INSERT ALEX EVENT HERE:

The single life isn't all that horrible.  I'm just waiting for mister right.  The only time I feel sad is when I see other couples... and I'll have a 2 second flash back of what I used to have, when it was good..  I know someone out there will love me.. so, I'm not worried, just a tiny bit impatient.  All I know is that I'm going to try not to love someone unless they love me back with the same love.

Prom is coming up soon.  Mom and I went to look at dresses the other night... I haven't decided if I'm going alone or with Dave yet...  I'm sure I'll have fun either way.

And last, but not least, I want to thank all of the people that have been here for me lately.  I love you all, and I have no idea what I'd do without you. *coughcoughjessicajenniferdavecoughcough*

Well, I think I'm going to go now... Those are the thoughts that have been floating around in my head lately... hah.  Have a good one."

"event","Timmy turned 12 Thursday. My baby brother is just growing up so fast!  *sniff sniff*  We ate pizza and cake.. and watched Spider Man 2.  It was nice... especially since we've been low-carbing the past few weeks.

Senior Day was Friday.  We didn't have to go to class... so that rocked... but the whole day was a bore.  We took cap and gown pictures and paid fees and all of that good stuff.  Our guest speaker was Cameron Kent, which amused me because he spoke at my 5th grade graduation.  We took our massive class picture outside in the football stands... it was windy and cold.  We got out of school early, so me and Jennifer went to Olive Garden and looked around at David's Bridal.  It was fun.  :)

Saturday was fun.  It was the Valentine's Day party at church.  Jennifer and Jessica came with me.  We went ice skating.  I didn't fall at all!!! WoO!  go me!  Then we went back to John and Mary Anne's to give Josh his surprise party.  He really was surprised.  And the game chubby bunny will never cease to gross me out.  That's all I will say about that. haha.  I had a huge headache all night, but I still enjoyed myself.  And let me say that John and Mary Anne are my favorite.  I <3 them. 

Valentine's Day wasn't such a bust since I was at home sick.  My dad gave me chocolate and my mom gave me some cute scarfs.  Dave gave me a special Valentine message Sunday morning.  Haha.  That's the only written valentine I got.  It was sweet though.

Sunday night, Alex, Sarah's boyfriend, got baptized.  :-D... I was so happy to hear about that.  He's such a great guy."

01. Reply with your name and I will write something about you.
02. I will then tell what song[s]/movie[s]/book[s] remind me of you.
03. Next, I will tell you who you remind me of, celebrity/animated or otherwise.
04. I will try to name a single word that best describes you.
05. I'll tell you the most memorable moment I've had with you.

"event","TWENTY-ONE PIECES OF ADVICE

ONE. Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.

TWO. Marry a man/woman you love to talk to. As you get older, their conversational skills will be as important as any other.

THREE. Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you want.

FOUR.  When you say, ""I love you,"" mean it.

FIVE.  When you say, ""I'm sorry,"" look the person in the eye.

SIX.  Be engaged at least six months before you get married.

SEVEN.  Believe in love at first sight.

EIGHT.  Never laugh at anyone's dreams. People who don't have dreams don't have much.

NINE. Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the only way to live life completely.

TEN. In disagreements, fight fairly. Please No name calling.

ELEVEN.  Don't judge people by their relatives.

TWELVE.  Talk slowly but think quickly.

THIRTEEN. When someone asks you a question you don't want to answer, smile and ask, ""Why do you want to know?""

FOURTEEN.  Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk.

FIFTEEN.  Say ""bless you"" when you hear someone sneeze.

SIXTEEN.  When you lose, don't lose the lesson.

SEVENTEEN. Remember the three R's: Respect for self; Respect for others; Responsibility for all your actions.

EIGHTEEN.  Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.

NINETEEN.  When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it.

TWENTY.  Smile when picking up the phone.  The caller will hear it in your voice.

TWENTY-ONE.  Spend some time alone."

<P>I was talking to a friend last night about nothing in particular.&nbsp; And I said the phrase ""life sucks.""&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; Didn't go into detail or anything.&nbsp; I want you to know that this friend called me and stayed on the phone with me til 1 in the morning.&nbsp; All because they knew something was wrong and they love me.&nbsp; He gave me some advice.&nbsp; ""<FONT color=#ff0000><FONT size=4><EM>You have to be happy with yourself</EM>...</FONT> </FONT>and once that happens other people will be happy with you.""&nbsp; You know.. he's right.&nbsp; He gave me the confidence to do something about my life.&nbsp; Because I AM beautiful and I AM smart.&nbsp; So, I've made a list of things I want to change about myself.. so I will be happy.&nbsp; It will take a while... but... hopefully things will work out.</P>
<P>The first thing on my list was to get rid of Alex.&nbsp; I knew that would be the hardest thing to do.&nbsp; I love him, but he only brings me down.&nbsp; It's not fair for me to love someone and put time and effort into a relationship when they don't care about me in the first place.&nbsp; To be honest he doesn't even deserve me as a friend, much less a girlfriend.&nbsp; He's hurt me countless times as a friend and as a boyfriend.&nbsp; I'm through with that.&nbsp; He can't have it both ways.&nbsp; I'm not letting him hurt me anymore.&nbsp; He's had plenty of chances to make things right.&nbsp; And do you know that he hasn't apologized once for the things he's done to me?&nbsp; I wanted to be with him and love him for the rest of this year so I wouldn't look back and resent him.&nbsp; It's too late for that.&nbsp; I hope that one day he realizes what he lost.&nbsp; I hope he will feel even a fraction of the pain he's caused me.&nbsp; My children are gonna look through my senior yearbook one day and ask who this Alex person is in my buddy article.&nbsp; And&nbsp;with a smile&nbsp;I will reply,&nbsp;""That's the boy who broke my heart into a thousand pieces.&nbsp; He's the reason I knew I was lucky when I found your father.""</P>"

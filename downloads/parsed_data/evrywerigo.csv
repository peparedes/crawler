For when&nbsp;a man&nbsp;seeks desparately&nbsp;for everyting, 
looking for anything, 
He'll end left with something, 
searching for nothing. 


For what you see of me, 
is he who veiw darkness as that of light's reflection. 
My shadow in the mirror, 
speaking bacx with open thoughts.&nbsp; 
The darkness all around,&nbsp; 
only plays imagination. 
A dream of those that slumber, 
silver bleedings in my heart."

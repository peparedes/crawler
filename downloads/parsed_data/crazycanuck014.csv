so passionate
great story
everything
i wanna go see it again

felt kinda bad that i couldnt go see across the universe...plans had already been made...but its ok though cause we'll all be seeing each other this weekend/next week so hopefully nothing huge comes out of this...as it tends to do for no apparent reason

thats something else that came out of tonight....i finally was able to let go of some things that in recent months i would've torn to shreds for no apparent reason

i think i've finally been able to find some kind of chaneg within myself....a different version of me

idk....but as for tonight i enjoy it


kthx





im really angry tonight too...idk why....

and i do have a rather inspired entry i need to be writing

so..until then"

"event","So...first and foremost
was watching the WWE special for the troops today..dx was back and those are always touchign neway
Anyway, this Christmas...put those troops in the back of your mind for w/e ur doing
Because..regardless of how you feel about the war then and now
those troops dont have the luxury of dealing with our problems....

As well as to all of my friends and loved ones...I hope that this holiday season is one of the better ones you have...after all, this is a pretty big one for us in some respects...

I love you guys...I really love you all

A while back...i wrote an entry that was something to the effect of...people were growing away from me...or..leavign me behind...i dont remember exactly...but it was called to my attention...as well as several others in the last week....

And...as I was sitting in my house today...celebrating the second of two straight holidays without any type of family...I did alot of deep thinking while i was distracting myself with several versions of Fire Emblem...and i thought to myself....none of those ppl ""went"" newhere...and i shouldnt have been wishing for the ""old"" them to come back...or what have you in the various situations....it was never them...I must assume full blame for the thoughts and reactions for a good 99.9999998% of the past 3 months..I dont know how i was able to convince myself of some of those things...or to actually write them and expect anyone at all to read them and think ""he's absolutely right""....was rediculous of me...and considering it involved the ppl i most sincerely and absolutely love without an inch of a doubt...i apologize as much as humanly possible..

this....incessant need for me to always assume that what i think is exactly whats happening...I've never given it a thought till the last week
When people used to make fun of me for it...i kinda laughed it off cause i got way too heated about some dumb argument like...what yesterdays math assignment was..or a detail to some story
then it started to effect major things in my life...and i still never bothered to give it any attention

to one person especially im sorry....the past few years our relationship has taken quite a few hits...and we've always managed to rebound
this time...obviously its quite bad...
but i remember in 7th grade...a conversation we had online after a coney island trip
we promiseed each other that nothing in the world would ever separate the two of us
mix in crazy hormones, and dumb decisions with some hurt feelings along with some other factors...and i know neither of us feel any different deep down inside
cause..even though i'll always see you as that little girl who tried to kill me on her playscape ^_^
I also respect the woman you're growing into after the recent talks we've had...and i'll be proud one day to look aroudn and tell everyone ""thats the best friend I've ever had""
the funny thing about love is...its unconditional....it doesnt matter what form of relationship we have
its the fact that we have that bond that makes it special...and..as proven..its made ppl jealous from time to time when its in full force
im waiting for the day we can get back to that promise we made all over again in 7th grade...and we can be best friends...and have that loving bond as strong as ever

and i cant tell you how sorry i am for everything i wrote in this damn journal..

along with everyone else....i would continue writing but im a bit emotionall burnt from today/yesterday's destruction of my family

but i promise i'll write another one when i can...

until then"

"event","so...obviously this entry...and clearing out my livejournal all the way to the end of 06 doesnt automatically change things that ive said before
believe me...i wish it did

but...obviously...what happened between us sucked...no doubt about it
and...whats happened to us since then has been all my fault...and again...no doubt about it worse than what started it

i realize that...i realized alot when u sent me that message
and i really feel that i have calmed down...and i have done everything i could to change whats been going on....it just sucks that one...you read my entries before we got back to normal and we could sort everything out...and two...you read them after we finally were over this entire situation...

the incoherentness thats been the last several months for me...have been compounded by things i've said...or ppl have said to me...and each and everything made the others worse...

the bottom line is...when you look at the very basics of the story...not how anyone and everyone..including myself has twisted it...it really wasnt as bad as more than half the things that are currently going on around all of us...

she didn't lead me on...
she caught herself before things got crazy...
she cared about me enough to offer explanations...
sure...it didnt work out they way either intended....
but thats what happens sometimes....and she really was sorry
and people do get busy...understandable to everyone nowadays...especially in senior year...
she told me countless times she ""needed me as a best friend, and i realized that.""
she really did handle things they way they should have been...

What did I do?
the same thing i've always done
mixed in with the way i had been....and it turned collassal...
and i dont want it to be the excuse ne longer....

all but ignoring what she was attempting to do, i focused on...all the very small things that I for some reason thought were necessary..but never really were...

she did...and does evrything possible given her current situation....


and im sorry every day for everything that has happened....especially to her...but i know that there have been other ppl as well to much lesser extents....

i messed up
i escalated everything far beyond any extent they should've reached
i failed to be that friend that i should've been
for reasons i cant even understand on my own

but i did realize that I need to change everything around
but im sorry
know that
and hopefully forgive me as well..."

"event","so....there is a lot i want to write in here tonight
but...i just dont have a will to write at this present time
i mean....who's really gonna listen anyway at this point

i just got two things right now...


1. i swear to god....no matter how small...if you do any one thing to hurt him...you will regret it for as long as i can remember your name

and


2. ive given up on this people...and honestly that includes myself....all words and actions lose their meaning....the two things that really define a person....they lose meaning because people use em for dumb reasons

and this....almost this need to go against everything you know you shouldnt do...because you ""know its right...its never felt like this""....again im not saying im above ne of this....it just gets so frustrating....to see people develop these thoughts...so quickly...and set themselves up for such a trainwreck....that cannot be avoided...ebcause its wat they've physically and mentally convinced themselves that they need...and thats justt he people who've just met

its gonna sound cliche here...believe me....but the words ""love"" and ""hate""....they lose meaning as you grwo older....because every couple that hits a one month anniversary is ""in love""...or anyone who wants to date your friend becomes ""hated""...

i dont really know wat else to write...but again i stress...im not saying that im not guilty of ne of this....i just cant stand how actual ""love""...from  ne two people...gets overshadowed by this sense of lust and hormones that creates so many relationships that should never have existed....but they do..because you ""love"" them

just...think about what the word actually means....just really sit and think about...what love is....i dont mean to get all preachy and anything

but...i believe in true love....and some people...not all...make a mockery of it...a downright mockery

i just hope when i find it...if i find it...that i'll know...and i wont..."

its a little different....not bad different....but...its like...some kind of awful awful cloud has disappeard over our friendship

bad imagery i kno..but bare with me

i finally feel like i can talk to u again..abut nething...and everything....and vice versa...and that our band literally has been nothing but at least doubled in strength....you really are my best friend....and we can finally get back to that

finally...

im so...uncontrollably happy right now....i missed you so much...i love you

i get it now...and im sry if i kinda made things difficult cause i wouldnt listen

and i hope you understand wat i said

i just feel like...i can take on so much more shit now that your back

and its not temporary this time because theres so much unresolved tension
who woulda thought the way that conversation started woulda resolved so much *_*

i love my best friend....and alot of this is probably incoherent...i'll write a better one later

but this is just rediculous....i asked for one thing...one god damn thing....just comment on my new pics that i have...cause i really love em....and...did you comment? no...you just ignored everything i said like your too good for me...honestly, how do you expect this friendship to work...if you cant even right four words about a friggen pool

why do you think ur better than me? or everyone else for that matter...when's the last time you spent like....all day if you had just to make sure someone was ok...i bet its been a while..u and that giant chest...just so selfish...you can keep your backrubs...you really hurt me...and im not sure i can ever forgive you for that

im sure ur probably just gonna go put ur brother to sleep...or...something else that'll be you ignoring me

some man my mom's known for like..6 months will be
obviously not biologically...but in every sense of the word basically
and...i guess he's a really cool guy....but...he's not my dad
and...i'm really conflicted...because..i can find ppl in high school that have been dating longer than my mom knows this guy....should they be getting married??

if i wanna be this guy that everyone can come and talk to whenever they need me....then i probably should act like it

even though it sounds to u like ur doing nothing wrong....that doesnt mean your not to someone else

andi  guess...for the longest time now....i've been trying way too hard to make sure that everyones ok...to the point where i actually start new fights because i cant really stop myself.

i really hope everyoen reading this understands...i never really intend to end up doing some of the things that have happend...it always started out as a genuine concern..that i couldnt let go

see...i virtually have no family....you guys reading this are my family....and i get alot out of knowing you guys are as happy as possible....so its kind of an opposite extreme when your not....as i'm sure everyone can understand...you've all had to of gone through that i'm sure

and i kno...i cannt really go back on wat happened...i wish i woulda handled it alot better

cause i alienated at least 3...although 2 were on more of a misinterpreted opinion i think...on my closest friends...and i'm really worried i'll never get to talk to them in the same way again..

but...i think i finally woke up...and i hope u guys can still allow me to help u if and when u need it....because you kno i'd never intentionally hurt any of u"

my newer friends, like ely, charlie, and rom, that i just started getting closer to this year, pretty much own the world. its been really great getting to kno them as a polar bear ninja, always ending up killing him somehow, or getting laughed at for laughing (somewhat of inside jokes for each one of em)

kelli,rachel, and alana i still at least hpe i'm close with. to different extents, there have been problems,whether brought to my attention outright, or things i wasnt supposed to hear. but i still heart em all, whether or not i'm one of their favorite ppl still or not...i mean i kno i havent always been perfect, but...some stuff has been a bit exaggerated, to some extent. and for kelli,i still hope she's doin ok...still seems rather..blah, recently..and i'm hoping that shes ok, or thati can help if need be. one things though, we all need to hang out soon...for more than an hour...after a dance..that no one liked neway...for the 48504th time in a row *_* ^_^

The official sneaky bears....pretty much amazing. actually getting to see lobster after so long was great, and even though the original hogged viva pinata the entire time, it was still great. rivan's still got a whip on him sooo bad its not funny...but i guess that happens sometimes. still, i think it'd be hard to find a group as close as us,without all the dumb time wasting fights (between us of course...errbody else fights), and....we obv. are better at mario party than neone...but yeh i'm just ramblin

my cuz and angie babie....how many times can i say it...there wouldnt be me without u guys. dan...jeez..i think we should just tell ppl we're brothers...and we pretty much should share rent somewhere for college or something like that...how amazing would that be. although..i'm a little worried how family parties will go once we gotta plan em.....oooo well. angie babie, idk wat else to say that hasnt already been said. best friends since forever, and i dont really see that ever stopping. kinda like kel, i've been worried bout u lately, but i kno when ur ready, i'll be waiting to help u out. with both of our short fuses, and other stuff along those lines, alot of dumb little fights are bound to happen....but..who cares huh. the bottom line is we'll always be best friends, everyone else is jealous that they cant be like us, end of story right? we gotta hang out this weekend...like...everyday

One thing i had a problem with...is how quickly ppl were willing to sell out...my best friend ever ...who i'd do anything u can think of for...presumably because they wanted to gain points with me..so to speak. Now of course, information was shared...that maybe shouldn't have been...but i'm willing to look past that...but..when it gets back to me...and the story has been changed to make her seem like she's the bad guy in the situation...while making me and jino look just as bad...how am i gonna react to that...and trust any of the rest of wat was told to me. I'm sry if neones got a problem with me and her being best friends...jealousy or wat have you...but...honestly...fuck you if thats the case...that dumb shit isnt worth my time.she'll tell me wat she wants..when she wants...i'm not worried about that in the least. Nothings gonna make her look bad in my eyes..at least nothing you can say...cause i mean..if she killed a guy..thats a different story. But my point is, it seems like theres a problem there somewhere...maybe it should be taken care of.

other than that stuff...things are amazing
my friends are great....its reaaally amazing finally getting to hang out with habibta...her and angie babie are pretty much the deadliest combo alive
i wish i could see kelli alot more though...she seems like she's been really down lately...and i hate not getting to help put on that
angie babie too for that much...they both seem pretty out of it...here's to them being ok *drinks shot*
Roms still pwned infintely for ditching me and mike *_* ^_^
and rachel better not make me do the ray approach...or she's gonna be sorry
and wat about alana...come to think of she's kinda disappeared for the most part too...wats happening with ma girls....*_* i promise never to say that again...ever



But..the saddest thing ever int he world...is that...the sneaky bears havent seen even close to enough of each other
for anyone who still has no idea who the sneaky bears are...and you should be ashamed of yourself >_<
1. Mike R (AsneakyBEAR -the original)
2. Me (CommanderPopNFresh)
3. Dave (Lobstrosity)
4. Sean (Rivan King)

sometimes honorary members
Rommel
Steve D.(judge)
Tom-where the hell has the jester been

dave's fallen off the face of the earth...sean's ""busy"" every friday...but thankfully the commander and his sneaky counterpart have been keeping it real..even though our jeopardy team sucked pretty bad...but we all need to hang out soon...geeking out or not....its great seeing those guys


so yeh...this concludes my random ranting about w/e...comment or wat not
had to edit some to avoid a problem though...sry"

"event","so..now that i'm pretty much sane and thinking straight again...and also deciding to forego writing about the lesson that my crazy emo rant taught me...basically...that would be...if u love someone...take their word for it every time...and make sure everyone always completly understands u before theres a huge ordeal

but neway...now that i think its safe to say i'm chilled and functioning right
its time for me to get back to wat i normally do
and thats help out everyone who means alot to me...because while i was being an idiot for a week...it sounds like quite a bit was goin down
plus...i prolly gotta sew up some things that i created...cause..i can get that way...never backing down an all...u kno it is

neway...i feel dumb for acting like i did...and i'll talk to who i have to about that...but...like i said...some of new best friends sounds like they're having rough patches....so i guess i came out of my daze at the right times.

two things though before i go....think about em for a while

think about the last conversation you had with all your friends and family....would u be happy knowing that was the last conversation you had with them?

and...in life...you dont get many chances to get or do something u want in life....so..when u get those chances....are you content just sitting back and saying ""if it happens, it happens""..aka..watch it slip away....or...do you wanna be the one who makes it happen...and....make ur life that much better
dont let the things u kno will be amazing slip by...because there r doubts...there always will be doubts...but most of the time...those doubts dont mean a thing"

everything was perfect...i was having the best times of my life
then i had to go and have a conversation that even i didnt think should've happened
now...i dont even know....my best friend wont talk to me unless i virtually beg...and i kno i'm the reason....i was dumb and i scared her...again...and...now i dont know wat to do
i was fine with everything the way they were...i still am...but not if it means i cant her even talk to her again

i thought maybe i was just overreacting till today...but now i'm officially out of ideas....
i love her to death..shes my best friend....and i kno she's worrying about something...
this isnt wat i wanted...i mean...that woulda been nice if it worked out....but i just wanna be able to actually get a response again...insetad of feeling like a creepy old guy at a mall...or a stalkerish type person...


other than that thigns r great tthough....

someone help...

i probably wont be on aim alot for a while too....its probably better to limit my chances to make an ass out of myself...

so txt or call if u want...or on myspace or something...i'll be around

p.s. ppl wanna hang out this weekend...starbucks and a movie or something?? idc...i just want outta here"

"event","yeh...i've been an idiot a couple times...done some things i probably shouldnt of done...but..if the same thing had happened to u...i'm sure u'd of been crazy too

but..the fact is...i gotta write some of this down...because i cant stand it in my head nemore

i dont have a sweet dad in a band
or a place up north...orr..stuff like that

in fact...in every way,shape, and form....i'm probably not even close to the person she should probably be with right now

but....everytime i listen to the stories of how she's being treated...
i'm reminded
of that little girl...who asked me out in kindergarten...asked me to marry her in third grade...and at least for a while...fell in love all over again in 9th grade

i was too dumb to notice except for the last time...just how true all that was...and how i time and time again...through...w/e u wanna call it...i threw it away

now..i probably cant offer even 1 tenth the things some ppl can
but in a certain sense....none of the rest of them even come close...when i can offer the world

not just....be a jackass who breaks up with u weekly...or invites other girls to his house etc...

i mean...who else really..at least tries cause sometimes its impossible....to be there for u...all the time...even when u dont want neone around...cause he knows thats really code for ""someone help me"".

if and once u read this...u'll probably think i'm crazy...but inside...i still see that little girl..the one who probably cared(s) about me more than i'll ever really kno or remember

it took me a while to get over wat happened the first time...mostly because..i thought there had to be another reason...till i realized...that u were right...we weren't ready

but then again....is neone ever 100% ready...or sure...of nething in life...i'm gonna steal a quote fromt he new will smith movie
""if there's something in life you want, go and get it. Period.""

girl i love u...and if think about it for a while...really think about it....i'm hopin someday...somehow...maybe i'll get something like this in return...

i ran out of stuff to write for now
but...if u ever read this...i hope u realize my intent wasnt to make neone mad...no to push neone away"

"event","so...i kno alot of ppl are having problems with plp they consider their best friend....and ppl in the past as well. and...my opinion on it is this

if you really feel that someone you kno...really truly is your best friend..and you dont just label everyone you kno that....that nothing in the world...nothing...can ever seperate you from that person...ever i dont care wat.....unless maybe...they ate babies with todd bertuzzi...then ok

but wat you gotta realize....is that...as with any strong relationship...any close one....that when there's a will there's a way... yea...sometimes ppl get mad...but if ur gonna bail...maybe time to rethink handing that title out so easy?

personally i feel...neone else comes and goes...best friends are forever....i love mine...and i'd do anything and everything for her....and if u can honestly say that too...then why does something so small get in the way

because...one day ur really gonna need that person...ur best friend....and..if u've argued about something stupid like not picking up a phone once...or ending up somewhere else one day instead of with u...will they be there?

and if you cant sit there and say...of course they will....we're best friends....then...i'm thinking this entry just made you rethink quite a bit



i hope this helped alot of ppl...it helped me..i realized quite a bit about wat that title means the past few days talking to a couple ppl...comment if u like..or im me idc

then another one of my friends...who i considered almost like a sister in a way...at least i feel that way....dunno bout her....especially not now . probably lost some kind of trust..or something..after my words were yet again taken out of context..and then i yelled at my other friend for no real reason...so i feel bad about that too

I didnt think you wanted me around nemore...that you didnt need me nemore...which has alot to do..i think with all of my random ""why dont u talk to nemore?"" related explosions....which was wrong. i dont even need to tell u...that its tough to change my mind once i have an idea in it...and i never stopped to listen/read nething u were telling me. i cant explain why..i dont even know...but that journal entry you wrote a while ago...and little other stuff i never even realized...showed me how wrong i was.

so...i'm sorry how i got mad for no reason sometimes...but like i said..i had myself tricked...i mean..if u thought that..u'd probably be upste/mad to urself wouldnt u? but..again. you journal showed me that i was pretty much all wrong...and i think we both have some stuff we gotta work on....but ever say you cant help me...because..ur still always the first person that comes to mind when i hear someone mention their best friend...or whenever someone talks about a playscape..and so on. I just hope that i havent damaged any of that with you...i still love to help u...hang out with u...laugh at those memories together...but i'm afraid my selfishness/whatever else u wanna call it if u can think of nething better....is what actually took u further from me.

and no...u probably dont kno exactly who/wat i'm talking about..so ask if ur unsure

o and...believe me..i kno everyone was trying to be nice yesterday..but as i was thinking about it today...

imagine u cant afford to pay for ur cable/water...and  u have to move because u cant afford ur house...now imagine someone pretends to not have enough money/doesnt have interest in bowling to make u feel better...

as that person that low on money...wouldnt u feel more offended than grateful....that someone would actually pretend not to have money so u wouldnt feel left out...i'm sry but that just emmbarrassed the crap out of me...again i kno the intent was to try and be nice....but this isnt just like i lost some cards or like a book or something, and you sit with me while everyone else has fun. its a little bit different...making me feel like i'm less than everyone was not the intent...but thats exactly wat happened

anyway, festival was great...i got to hang out with some ppl who i really never have alot before...or some ppl i never ever see nemore...i just wish i had some money for a car so i didnt have to wait 7 billion years before i see some of them..in lion years of course.

so yea neway...basically a very good weekend. i felt like lately, my group of friends i hang out with alot have change completly, although at the same time completly for the better. i guess sometimes it has to happen, but in this case i'm glad it did, or i'd never be as close to some of these ppl ( i hope they kno i'm talkin about em..u can ask if u want i guess).

on a different note to end...have you ever had the feeling that...ur just not as good as someone else..at least in a specific situation/for a specific person. i guess reality hit me this weekend, but at the same time i'm not mad about it either like i usually would be. i think for the first time, i'm actually glad for those two

i'm likin the new/less paranoied me

mucho commments welcomed..needed

also..probably much more on each later

you stay classy

"event","random thoughts on random people. most of who wont even read this (might be updated later if i think of more or better ways to write any of this)

1.my best friend. that kind you dont even need to talk to to have a conversation. you've got to one of the biggest jackasses in the world 60% of the time...but then again, thats problem the same reason we're such good friends till this day. i'd love to have ur gift of just tellin like it is

2.another good friend of mine, your one of the smartest yet most idiotic people i've ever met. its hard to pin you down. you a nice guy, yet at the same time ur probably one of the most underhanded person anyone could meet. its hard to tell sometimes whether or not i wanna knock u out or congratulate you knowin you may actually have it right.

3. we havent been hangin out as long as with the other two, but i think we might understand each other better than neone else on this list. Started hanging out mroe in high school, and the sarcastic view on almost everyone else we know couldnt be matched if we tried. not to mention, of course, no one else can come close to our love of video games. its weird how one in the same we can be.

4.time to change it up a bit. I love you, plain a simple. we've been best friends forever, a different kind then the other one.. one of those inseperable bonds. we've both had our share of making it rough along the way, but we'll probably always stay friends. i dont like being yelled at when i ask why we never hang out nemore. sometimes it can be so frustrating to feel like the bad guy for no real reason. 

5.you, while not either of our faults, i cant help but get angry when i hear about u. its my problem, but something i cant really help or change. so, dont take it personal ( or no one else who figures out who this is), its just the way i feel. ur probably a great guy even though i dont kno u well, its just the situation that makes me this way, whether u even know wat happened or not

6. you i drifted away from. whether it be school or any other random occurance, it happened. i still like talking to and hangin out with u. and, i kno it can be maddening sometimes believe me, but dont take anything me and my other albino friend say seriously, its in out blood to be bitterly sarcastic, and to attack anything we feel is wrong. it just happens to be a horrible tandem i guess. it doesnt mean we hate you, in fact you get off easy ^_^. we should hang out more.

7. same kind of thing with the next one, without the apology for sarcasm. used to talk alot, but i got a little crazy, made an idiot out of myself an yea *_*. but, either way, i never really got to get to kno you incredibly well although we did talk alot, i kinda regret that. we really need to hang out mroe than we do. you might find it weird, but i have alot of respect for you and think ur a great person. ur smart (again even though u'll probably laugh at that), but u have different, more sane views on things than most people do, and i really enjoy talking to u alot, even if most of it is just me making horrible attempts at jokes.

8. best friends be damned, your a brother to me. we're more than just cousins man. we dont see each other nearly enough during the year because of distance, but nothin can ever quite compare to all those nights of lost sleep beating up on ppl on xbox live, or playing with w/e we could find when we were like 5 and didnt kno any better. we've literally been closer than neone since we were too young to kno who the other one was. Man i'd give anything to have u live closer. Many,many years ahead of us man, and the times can only get better. even if r a little bit thickheaded sometimes man, it doesnt even matter, cause my year isnt quite complete till i hear ur latest scheme to buy something u have no chance of getting, or playing mario tennis through a whole family party ^_^

9. you're an idiot, plain and simple. again, i've known u forever and we're great friends. i dont hate you like that first sentence would suggest. but, c'mon man. some girls dont like you, ppl make fun of you. GET THE FUCK OVER IT. you not emo. i dont wanna sit here and dis the whole culture, but my friend, if there's neone whos not emo, its you. there's no way someone like you can think that low of everything around them. you dont have that in you, you just think you do. yea, it fuckin hurts when a girl doesnt like u sometimes, but ya kno wat, that doesnt mean u start hating the world. you just deal with it. the world can suck, suck hard, but get over urself. you have a fairly good life. you've got great friends for the most part. a nice house in a safe neighborhood. your not in new orleans, or africa or nething like that. the biggest decision of ur life right now is, wat am i gonna wear to school when i go back. no one says u cant be upset or mad at someone, but, speaking as someone who knows u better than nebody, this just isnt you

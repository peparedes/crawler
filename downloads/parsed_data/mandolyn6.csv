"event","Yes! I had such a fantastic day! Erin thank you for understanding why I was upset with you. I am happy were still friends. The mini break is gonna be wonderful!! Amy I hope you have a better day tomorrow, which you will since were all going out to lunch together! I feel so accomplished right now. I calmly packed my stuff for steamboat, finished most of my homework, and played a game of foosball (which I unfortunately lost but hey, I played Nick the foosballmasta) But he only won cuz he desperately wanted to get back at me for putting gummy bears in the sandwiches I made him for lunch! He he he! The root canals I endured today weren't even that bad, it is worth it to get some of that heavenly novacaine......Can you get addicted to that stuff? Cuz I have had at least 7 shots of it in the last month already...Did you know Greenday has a song about novacaine? It's a good one, but not as good as the Killers. Well I think I will go get something to eat, since Nick cooked the steaks for dinner and they were profusely dripping with blood. I want my meat to taste like well done A1 steak sauce, not actual animals okay? Is that too much to ask? Erin, remember- Chicks before dicks....or sisters before misters...or whatever it was...."

"event","I was having an average day, then I talked to Suz. After that I felt so much better than I had in over a week. I don't know why, but when you talk to someone who understands you completely, you get such a wave of relief! My horoscope told me to talk to a friend I think has been drifting away, so I decided that I will, tomorrow, in a three page letter. Yes I went overboard, but it is hard for me to explain things concisely, as you can tell if you read my live journal, considering everyday I say a shitload. (excuse the language). Tara and Suz, I feel your pain honestly, I do. I wonder if anyone will actually ever read this? I read my sisters live journal, but does anyone else? Who knows. Maybe this will improve my memory, make me more like Tack tara. Tack is short for tactful not tacky okay? I promise! brrr! It was freezing today, wasn't expecting snow, that was why I wore sandals. So my brother made me slave over making him two sandwiches perfectly to his orders, to bring to work today, and this morning he forgot them! Then to apologize for his inadvertent mistake, he obliterated me in our game of foosball, score was 10-7. The other day he only beat me by one. I was really angry that day so maybe I play better foosball when I am angry. Eh, who knows. Not like anyone cares about my personal life so I am going to stop rambling now. But one final choice-- should I do my homework or not? I guess I'll do it because, oh yeah, I have a C in that class and most of the people in it are FRESHMEN! It must be a virgo moon today because I cleaned my room...and it only took an hour and a half.... Oh and I need to mention, yesterday the subject of my journal entry had an obvious error, I meant to say ""when YOU'RE single."""

"event","I am so glad I have such good friends to support me on rough days such as this one. Let's just say this is a bad beginning to a week that is hopefully going to be wonderful. Last week was not the best I have had the pleasure of experiencing. With my constant trips to the feared Dr. A for arduous sadies plans, crying in front of my schools entire administration, and the forced treks to see the counselor for students with last names beginning with unfortunately mine. Was it my poor hearing or did Ms. Boian not promise complete confidentiality when we turned in our triangle papers? I guess honesty isn't always the best policy. Why do I break so easy? I lost all self control and became a human water faucet last week. Tara my darling, thanks for being so supportive of me, and Amy thanks for being so understanding. All the times I cried last week.....oh well the past is behind me now. So much for the Sadie Hawkins dance...I heard it was the best ever. Thanks for sharing. I easily spent more time at Mile High Station than any of you dance attendees, yeah, that's right, I slaved putting up all those decorations that supposedly weren't, how did Katy Kelly put it? ""Worth the cost of the tickets"" Considering our schools total expenses for that dance were around 6,000 dollars, and $300 of it went towards decorations what the hell were you thinking?  The decorations were great, you just shouldn't come if your expecting anything better, were a frickin public school. So Brooke A. is taking classes online. How did she come up with that brilliant idea before me? I wish my mom would cough up the $37 for online courses, wouldn't that be wonderful, not going to school to see the usual people I only wish to see in my nightmares. Hey guys in interact club, consider coming to the ice cream socials because I was the only one who went last saturday, and scooping frozen solid ice cream for one hour straight isn't entirely my idea of a good time. If your gonna be in the club at least do something!! Well I definitely wrote way too much, so I am just going to stop procrastinating and do my homework."

"event","well i had to face the reality that my actions can lead to something life changing. i had to face the music and take a dreaded test that could have turned my whole life around. things turned out to be negative but never the less life lesson learned. the thoughts that have been occupying my mind the past 2 weeks has made me think and rethink alot of what i thought and believe."

"event","between my friend and his girlfriend. the girlfriend of my friend came up to me last night and pulled me aside to talk to me about the problems she is having with her boyfriend. i played stupid like i didn't know that there were any problems. i of course know because my friend has told me he is not wanting anything serious but his girlfriend is starting to demand something serious. so anyway, his girlfriend is telling me last night she thinks he is being lame for not facing a relationship with maturity, i have to agree w/ her but i did not say anything, i just listened. anyhow her boyfriend walks up to us and she turned to him and told him to ""Fuck Off"". so he was obviously pissed off and walked off. she was playing when she said that but he did not take it as such, so they had to run off and have a massive talk. fast forward to the party. we are all outside talking and of course the subject of sex comes up. my girlfriends and i are talking about the difficulties of having sex with a guy who is well, not large. haha sorry. anyway so she pipes in with her comments and it apparently pissed her boyfriend off. so another talk had to happend.  fast forward yet again to the apt. we are all there and i walk to the kitchen and i ask my friend if the strips to test how drunk you are really work, so he said tired it. i then yell out ""oh this is like a pregnancy test, not that i have ever taken one!"" well chime in my friends girlfriend. she drops the bomb on her boyfriend and said ""oh yeah well i took one about 2 mths ago, because i was 2 weeks late!"" she then died laughing. i looked over at my friend and saw the blood from his face drain. it ruined his night because she never told him about this until then. so she went to bed and then i am hanging out with my male friends. i tell my friend that I love him and he yells out at me ""Iris you have been nothing but trouble for me tonight!"" and walks out pissed off. i jumped from my seat and ran out after him to talk. i told him i did not start this shit all of it was brought about because i happend to be there and it forced some confessions. he was ok but man he was not happy. so he said, ""alright you, *myboytoy* and I are going out right now!"" so off we went. i spent the whole night and my morning with them. drinking, playing pool and talking."

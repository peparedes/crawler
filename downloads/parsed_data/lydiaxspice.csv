you hit the bar i hit the door
sometimes i hate
the weight of the girl i have to be
sometimes the way you look just
fucking kills me

pop pop pop 
where will it end?
when's it gonna stop?
don't play me like that baby
you're already driving me 

CRAZY.

i didn't do anything, i just stood there smiling
i didn't even say anything
and now you're followin me around like i'm 
some kinda...
some kinda...
some kinda wonderful

i'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop
for every long look i get from you
i get 2 ""I WANT YOU TO DIE"" looks
from her
but i can't apologize because there's nothing
nothing
nothing
to apologize for"

"event","rrently i am having a love affair with my own imagination. currently i am thinking way more than i am talking and i am spending a lot of time by myself. even in my own house while there's a party going on. i am wishing and hoping that this wintertime blues will pass and leave me hopefully less scarred than i feel right now. that maybe some of the wounds will heal WITHOUT leaving scars. i miss being fun and fancy-free. 

 last new years carrie and i drank absinthe and then champagne and played cards.  i fell off my shoes.

this new years i plan to drink wine until i can't walk and kiss as many people as possible at midnight. i don't know. i just wanna be a party girl. i just wanna be a rock star..."

"event","Last night. Hm. Interesting enough. Josh and I spent all day at his mom's house and then around 7 or so, we went to Kris's. Now, Kris had promised to be HOME by like 5. But he wasn't there at 7, so we went to the movies. Miss COngeniality. It's a cute movie. (I have been seeing a lot of ""cute"" movies lately. None of them are particularly GOOD but they're all CUTE.) After the movie, we went back to Kris's house and found that Kris, Trent, Abe and Derrick were there. And the plan was to go see Dracula 2000 at 10:30. Josh didn't wanna go see another movie, so I went with them. Abe and I pointed out vampire powers and talked about the Catholic dogma in use. There are a lot of scenes in New Orleans which just makes me want to go even more than I already do.

I long for the French Quarter. We all want to go. ""We all"" being me, Ardy and Abe. No one else is really into it.

Then we went back and we were talking about tattoos. Joey and I talked about cameras. The final joke of the night:

Trent: I think you should get silver dollar signs tattooed on your nipples.
Me: And then I'd be what? Ghetto-fabulous?

Then we came home. I took a shower because my hair was sprayed on top of my head. When I got out, Aaron and Boyette were here. I went to bed shortly after.

That's my boring Christmas Day."

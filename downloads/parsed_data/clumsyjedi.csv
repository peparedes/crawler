I would just be sitting on his couch and he would pull out another stack of documentation from her majesties government explaining why he was deported and I was expected to sit there and go 'Yeah it's fucked alright'."

Later today I will try and somehow import these posts and images into facebook so I am not dealing with three blagging systems.

Item: EEE Xandros sucks. Does anyoe know how I can flush an iso of eeebuntu onto an sd card so it boots properly, preferably with only simple tools like dd?

Item: Ruby is just Perl and Python stapled together. Who knew.

Item: Fight like Apes still rock more than you do. Just deal with it.

Item: I am more and more into Rasputina. Oh Perilous world is my new favourite album, and appears to be a history of Pitcairn Island. Nifty."

"event","These were taken in some Austrian town I have forgotten the name of. It was a nice place, but bad things happened here. I had been drinking to get plastered every day for about a month at this point. On my last night the cops drove me home. No, I don't remember why. I have been off the sauce since then. You will notice that no photos exist from Slovenia. This is because I hid in my hotel room with drinkers remorse for two days before flying to the opposite side of Europe. Good times.

I call this one 'Freakish woman in tree'.

"event","It is. Teh Suck. You can't deny it. Having seen some really beautiful stuff around Kalaw and Inle Lake I am quite underwhelmed by the urban stylings of Mandalay. But since this blog seems to contain way more bitching than anything else I will forgo the negativity and tell you what I like about Mandalay.

First and foremost, Mandalay has draught beer. In most of the country if you want a beer you have to go to a restaurant to buy it. There are no pubs in Myanmar anywhere but in Mandalay you have something similar enough called a beer station - bars operated by one f the local breweries that serve one or two different kinds of beer on tap. My favourite beer stations are those operated by Dagon[1] breweries. In a moment of inspiration someone at the Dagon offices decided to staff these venues with local hotties dressed in cute little Dagon beer uniforms. You sit and drink and they bring the beer to you - just like God intended. My favourite beer station is on the banks of the Ayerarwaddy river, it has a west facing balcony where you can watch the sun going down, taste some beers going down and muse about the beer wenches going down. If you can ignore the roar of boat engines being flushed on the river below you it is quite tranquil. Then the mosquitoes come up and you have to flee back to the bustle of the city.

Another cool thing in Mandalay is the Marionette show. Once upon a time Myanmar boasted a widespread and highly developed community of practitioners of this art form but today it has all but been extinguished by 100 years of internal strife. Back in the 90's a Mandalay family found the last two surviving puppet masters in Myanmar and established the Myanmar Marionette Troupe. Their show is quite spectacular and showcases the talents of both the artisans who create the Marionnettes and the puppeteers themselves. With the exception of the one remaining puppet master the entire crew come from a single family and that family have been solely responsible for reviving this centuries old artform within Myanmar[2]. 

For those who are interested, the  handcrafted marionettes in question have about 16 points of articulation (including the individual buttocks) and are operated with both hands of the puppeteer. The level of control exercised by the puppeteer allows for sophisticated movements such as the manipulation of the puppets clothing by the puppets hand. The strings of two puppets are also frequently tangled and then disentangled during performance which I found amazing. Another interesting performance showed a puppet on stage with a live dancer and illustrated how traditional Myanmar dance has evolved to emulate the movements of the marionettes. 

Finally, there is one more thing about Mandalay that distinguishes it from the rest of Myanmar. Dairy products. There is an ice cream store in Mandalay where you can buy a glass of milk. Not non-dairy creamer mind you. Milk. And hell, even a milkshake. If you've never lived without dairy for two weeks you have no idea how much this meant to me. I almost fell to my knees and kissed the pavement when I found the Nylon Ice Cream Bar (They sell beer too).

But really, Mandalay is just a transport hub. If you ever travel Myanmar don't get suckered into thinking that Mandalay is a destination in and of itself. The attractions are tame and the atmosphere oppressive. Heed my words little ones, for I have beheld it with mine own eyes.

[1] It is difficult for an H.P Lovecraft fan to ingest something called Dagon without wincing, but once you start it is really quite pleasant. Ia Ia. Cthulhu fhtagn.
[2] In fact the Myanmar marionette tradition could be said to have been revived internationally since the troupe tour many countries."

"event","It looks like a dreamscape. The water melts into the sky, betraying a trace outline of the mountain  ranges where they meet. This is Inle Lake, a mountain paradise in the centre of Myanmar. 

I arrived at the outskirts of the lake on foot from Kalaw and was transported to Nyaungshwe, the main tourist town by a skiff like vessel. The lake itself is almost empty since this is the dry season, but it still stretches several kilometres across. The rivers leading into the lake are no more than a foot in depth and the flat bottomed boats are transporting up to ten people at a time - it's a wonder that they don't capsize (more often).

Much of the industry here is tourist oriented, guided boat tours and the like. Those locals who are not involved in pandering to tourists sustain themselves through traditional pastimes. On the surface of the water thousands of flat bottomed canoes are operated by fisherman who operate the oars with their legs in order to free their arms to work the nets. It's a pretty spectacular sight to see these guys stand on the aft of a boat on one leg while the other operates the paddles and they bring in their nets at the same time. Gravity says you should fall, so why don't you fall dammit!

Now that the water levels have retreated the banks of the river are covered by rice paddies. Those parts of the landscape that are not faded to mesmerising grey by the water, cloud and smoke are a brilliant green. In 6 months when the rains begin again these areas will be submerged once more but for now the extra agricultural space has been claimed. I've watched new fields being landscaped and it's a matter of finding a flat piece of land, scooping the dirt into a 50 square metre area and then stuffing the resulting receptacle with seeds. To get enough dirt to form the perimeter some dude will take his canoe out to a muddy part of the lake, and scoop it full of dirt. So this flat bottom boat that sits half a foot below the water line and half a foot above is loaded with about two feet of dirt all along it's length and then rowed (with one foot) back to the location of the new field. The balance these guys have is incredible.

I pass the time in Inle Lake with typically touristy activities. I cycle around the lake, take a boat tour and get a traditional Burmese Massage. Has anyone ever had such a massage before (traditional Thai massage counts)? It is absolutely excruciating. The masseuse was a tiny little girl but the way she drives her fingers into your tender bits you would think you were being molested by a decepticon. 

Despite this abuse, I could happily have stayed in Inle Lake a lot longer. But time is starting to run short so I book a bus to Mandalay for the next exciting chapter in the tour."

"event","After my horrific ordeal on the bus, which will henceforth be known as Charon's gambit I was treated to one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I was dropped off in a small touristy town called Kalaw. It is roughly at the geographic centre of the country and one of the more northerly points accessible to tourists. I didn't really have idea as to what to do while I was here but fortunately I had made a few new friends on the road and in the hotel where I was staying: Three French alcoholics (Benoit, Greg and Didiere) and a Japanese girl (Mayuka).

Basically all of these people had plans to hike in the surrounding mountains for the next few days. Now you know me - I'm all about hiking. So I booked myself in for a 3 day/2 night trek from Kalaw to Inle Lake with Benoit and Mayuka. It didn't sound too strenuous as we would be dropping from an altitude of about 1500m to 1000m over the course of the trek. We got a multilingual guide for the tour and would be staying in a traditional village on the first night and then a Buddhist monastery on the second. It sounded just ok to me but I was happy to have something to do, to have friends to talk to and I figured that even if I hated the trek I would end up in another more aesthetically pleasing locale so I said 'Bring it on'.

(I didn't really say that, I said 'I want my name to be Spaghetti' but no one got it).

The first day's walk was pretty good fun. We saw some very magical countryside, learned about local agriculture, attended a traditional wedding reception (no booze, really?) and ended up spending the night in a Palau village. After an absolutely amazing meal prepared from the produce grown by the local tribes we were introduced to three girls and told they wanted to ask us questions as they were trying to learn English.

Now I would guess that by most of their English education came from other backpackers taken to this village in the past cos it was pretty threadbare. They asked us a few English questions.

""What is your name?""
""Where do you come from?""

And we answered. Then they looked at us expectantly which was awkward indeed. So we tried asking them some questions.

""Do you live with your family?""
""Is she your sister?""

 They clearly didn't know what we were saying (our bilingual guide had conveniently left somewhere around ""What is your name?""). Then I remembered the Bamar phrase book. Salvation. 

So we re-asked our original questions and this time we pointed them to the Bamar translations. And then they read the Bamar translation back to us which wasn't really what we were trying to achieve in an English lesson. After several aborted attempts to communicate in English using the phrase book we had another, hopefully better idea. Noun exchange.

Noun exchange is a pretty good way to learn the rudiments of a language which we probably would have defaulted to if any of us had training as language teachers. Basically you find an object in the room (cup, bowl, table etc), point to it and then say the noun. You can do this for the same object in both languages and hence a balanced exchange of information develops between the two parties. It worked really well. After a few minutes the atmosphere was very comfortable with lots of giggling at mispronunciations and such. Benoit and I also had received sufficient prior instruction in Bamar pickup lines that we could glean that one of these girls had a crush on him. Squealing denials ensued. It was a really rare and beautiful experience for me and I think for all involved. 

The next days walking was a fair bit harder. We are in the dry season in Myanmar and so not only was the terrain mountainous but the ground was covered in fine dust that permeates everything. There's also not much moisture in the air and you churn through your drinking water at a fair clip. But the landscape is still inspiring and the experience is still a rewarding one. We visited several villages of another mountain people (P'oh) and saw traditional weaving and farming practices. In the afternoon we stopped at a monastery where we will spend the night. Our guide runs off to sort out our accommodation and we flee to the nearest non-monastic dwelling to find beer. It's there. Fuck yeah! We almost bite the tops off three longnecks and plop down outside this bungalow revelling in the sunset. 

A few minutes later an old man (70ish) wanders up and starts talking to us. He points at our beer, then himself. The process is repeated several times. We are all willing to booze him up but we don't want to give him one of the bottles because then it will not be in our mouths for a fleeting moment. He repeats the pointing thing several more times while we attempt to solve this dilemma, and starts to look dejected. Suddenly I am possesed by some bizarre spiritual force. My eyes roll back in my head to reveal luminous spheres. Wisps of black and pink smoke form a halo behind my head. I speak with the voice of a thousand golden Buddhas.

""Laquei.""

Instantly my original mundane appearance returns, and the old man departs and returns moments later with a tea cup. Behold my power: I have communicated. We give him a dose and he stands and drinks it with us, and then disappears again. This time he returns with a longneck and through a series of gesticulations invites us to his house. We follow him a short distance to his home and sit with his family: His son, his brother, and his daughter (OhmygodohmygodohmygodsheissofuckinghotandsheslookingrightatmewhatdoIdowhatdoIdo? Say, where did that baby come from?). We engage in another few rounds of noun exchange and have another really good time together smoking the old mans cigars and taking photos of the family which we promise to send back to them via our guide. We leave after dark and return to the monastery much richer people. (Inside ourselves you dolts. They had nothing to steal.)

By the way, the monasteries are not what you would expect. Well, they are what you would expect with the sleeping on the floor and the little kids dressed as the Dalai Lama and all but there are a lot of things you wouldn't expect too. Like how they sit around till the wee hours watching bad kung-fu movies or the wind generator that supplies at least part of the monastery's required power.

Day three is mercifully shorter. The trek has been great and all but by the third day my feet are so sore and my throat so dry that the only way I can keep myself going is by replyiing Justice League Unlimited episodes in my head. The tour ends with a short boat ride in a skiff like vessel down a 1 foot deep river (dry season remember) into Inle Lake and then to our destination Nyaungshwe on the banks of the lake. This river actually has steps/drops of about a foot and so the locals have constructed partial dams over the width of the river to funnel the water into the center creating a point deep enough that one of these flat bottomed boats can go up the steps as well as down. Cool.

All in all it has been a really good three days. I have heard it said since I came to this country and I believe it to be true: Burma has no must-see attractions except the people(s). There is something very special about the way they live their lives under the shadow of tyranny yet maintain their inner beauty and radiant demeanour. It's like nothing I have seen before (I really only have Central America to compare it to, but there are parts of that continent that are equally as isolated as this country).

When you visit a village here the children don't mob you demanding a dollar for a photo opportunity. Nor are you mobbed by purveyors of local handicrafts. The children long to have their photos taken and burst into glowing smiles when you show them their face in the view finder. When you visit someone's house they show amazing hospitality and generosity even though they have so little to give. Everyone says hello (mingalaba) to you in the streets. Even in the cities where people are a bit more cynical and jaded they are still amazingly friendly and despite the fact that there is a financial incentive for them in many interactions with foreigners they don't lie or try and distract you while someone picks your pocket. You may pay more than you should for something because you don't know it's true value but if you hand over more than the agreed amount by accident the excess is handed straight back. You are invited into strange houses by strangers about as often as you would be in any country where you are an outsider, but here the sense of menace and foreboding is replaced by warmth and welcome. Outsiders are as fascinating to them (or more) as they are to us.

 I am, in case you cannot tell, quite overwhelmed and touched by it all.

"event","I arrived in the and was picked up from the airport by Myo, a Bamar taxi driver who runs, what I imagine is a healthy business in acting as a tour guide for confused foreigners disoriented by the massive time warp they must pass through in order to enter Myanmar. He talks a good game and has convinced me to allow him to collect me tomorrow for a guided tour of Yangon. I pay him US20 in advance and am convinced at the time that  I will never see him or the money again. 

Myo is determined that I stay at a hotel of his choosing because the one I have selected will not permit taxi drivers to harangue the patrons in their rooms. This is, of course, a strong incentive for me to stick to my guns and lodge myself at my original choice: the White House.

This turns out to be a very good call indeed. The White House is the right sort of place. It's a four storey tower in the dead centre of town with rooftop views that encompass most of the city. You get a 360 degree panorama view in which you can see a) the gold plated spires of the five or six massive temples that are commonly presented as the skyline of Yangon and b) the relative catastrophe that is Yangon city. 

This city was obviously once something of immernse beauty. I know little about architecture but picture a sprawling city populated by multicolored buildings with elaborate facades constructed by British colonials over the past two cenbturies and you will have some idea of what Yangon must have looked like once upon a time - a fairy tale. 

Now wind the imaginary timepiece in your mind (we all have one, it's nothing to be ashamed of) forward by fifty years. As the infrastructure needed to sustain a metropolis decays it is not upgraded or repaired, just ignored. The exteriors of the buildings are blackened by smog and the traces of long extinguished fires. The interiors are stripped by the inhabitants for useful or valuable components. The overall impression is one of a disaster zone. 

If you look a bit closer though you can tell that while the Governemnt does nothing to maintain the city the local population do. This is a functioning city, no mistake. Enormous effort has gone into thousands of DIY projects across Yangon to ensure that these dwellings have light power and running water. I don't think there is any centralised authority maintaining this shit - there is just an amazing amount of effort being made on the part of the citizenry to keep things working. The number of electrical maintenance tools available through the ubiquitous street markets is testament to that fact. 

I wander through the streets dazed. I had intended to stroll to one of the golden temples that jut above the city skyline and take some inspirational photographs but you just can't look upward. The guide book suggested that it was incongruous that people should live out their mundane day to day existences in the shadows of such ancient marvels but my impression is that the theater taking place on the streets is far more powerful, far more engaging than any sculpture or fresco left by their ancestors. 

As I attempt to frame a shot of Sule Paya, a Buddhist temple rising bedecked in gold leaf and placed inconspicuously in the centre of the busiest intersection in town I am stopped by Benjamin. At 72 years of age he has migrated to Burma over 50 years ago from India. He is . While he fascinates me with his stories about how Yangon was architected by a man named Fraser and of the high population of Burmese in Perth the footpath around me begins to fill with various urchins and touts who can sense that I am for the moment unable or unwilling to evade them. It is probably a practiced technique but what the fuck.

I buy a postcard from a young girl for 4 times its value in USD. I buy a sparrow from an elderly woman and Benjamin explains that to the Burman, by releasing it I am freeing my own life. She suggests that I buy another one and I answer that I only have one life. Benjamin translates my reply with a showman's ear for comedy. Polite laughter confirms for me that I have committed a faux pas although I don't fully appreciate it's scope.

Later, back at the White House, I reflect upon the city from the rooftop. The sun is setting and as the oppressive heat diminishes somewhat the hubbub on the streets below changes in tone. The staccato of street hawkers is replaced by the meloncholy songs weaving through city blocks from the mosques. Families play soccer in the lengthening intervals between vehicles. The maginficent temples, illuminated by one of the few power sources the government does bother to maintain no doubt provide serendipity to the city's millions of Buddhists.

It is hard to understand the lives of these people from such shallow observations. The one overriding impression I have is that of the power of passive repression. You don't see tanks or guns in the streets here. The regime has no explicit presence and if you had to judge whether these people were suffering at the hands of a malevolent administration you might guess not. It's more a case of what the government doesn't do in  Yangon. While the cost of drinking water escalates nothing is done. While the power and plumbing deteriorate to dangerous levels nothing is done. I shouldn't say nothing: there is talk of a recently completed officers golf course on the outskirts of Yangon. 

My reflection at this point has started to nosedive into morbid territory. Just as I have resigned myself to the fact that this must be a city devoid of hope a flurry of movement draws my attention. In the dying moments of the sunset the skyline has burst into a crescendo of activity as thousands of tiny sparrows take to the sky - each one a life crying to be released from bondage and each one a symbol that perhaps hope is indeed eternal.

EDIT: The following final depressing line was cropped from the last paragraph above because I determined that is the info contained therein was probably factually inaccurate (Try and tell me the differencve between a bat and a sparrow in the dusk motherfucker). Once it was gone the whole thing had to be rewritten as a serious piece instead of a black humour piece. I still like the bleak overtones it gives the whole thing though.

each one a life crying to be released from bondage and each one a symbol that perhaps hope is indeed eternal. I am interrupted from these thoughts by a clarifying comment from another tourist. 

""Amazing aren't they. The bats I mean. The Laotians decapitate, skewer and eat them. I think it's cruel. Well, seeya""."

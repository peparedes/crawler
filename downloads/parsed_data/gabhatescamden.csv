"event","Today was the 2nd day I stayed home from school, I just feel like I have the flu, but I guess I am getting better. Mrs. Burr called me today and wanted to know what was going on with me and forensics....I decided to just go and observe since I have been sick...I am a little disapointed that I am not competing, but a little relieved since I am not quite sure if I am ready. We are going to Hampton tommorow, which is only about 30 minutes away, so why in the hell are we leaving at 1:45 when competition starts at 4 pm? I am excited since last time I met so many great people and it was a lot of fun, although spending all of that time with Julian just made me even more confused and shit, so I am sure tommorow will be just as bad.....don't know if I will stick with Megan in impromptu speaking or run off with him.....hmmmmm. I think I am seriously going to stick with being vegan...well, eating vegan, not adopting the whole lifestyle and everything, instead of starving myself here and there and having really bad eating habits....I guess I am just paranoid of gaining back all of the weight I have lost...it just scares me."

I need to get my Bright Eyes ticket, I have been needing to forever now, and I am definately going since it is the only concert I see in the near future at the moment.....I can't wait.

"event","So Gloria came over yesterday and we hung out for a few hours. She is really the greatest friend I have probably ever had, and I hope she knows that. We watched Pretty in Pink, and of course I was half-dancing to New Order/Echo and the Bunnymen/The Psychedelic Furs. Talked about music, life, sex, relationships, all of the important subjects in life. I really would love to go to Naples with her this summer, that would be amazing. I am going to work out today, I think it will make me feel better since I feel a little icky. Hopefully tommorow I can go spend time with Robert, oh how nice that would be.

You're as tight as a hunter's trap
Hidden well, what are you concealing
Poker face, carved in stone
Amongst friends, but all alone
Why do you hide

Say something, say something, anything
I've shown you everything
Give me a sign
Say something, say something, anything
Your silence is deafening
Pay me in kind

Take a drug to set you free
Strange fruit from a forbidden tree
You've got to come down soon
More than a drug is what I need
Need a change of scenery
Need a new life

Say something, say something anything
I've shown you everything
Give me a sign
Say something, say something, anything
Your silence is deafening
Pay me in kind

Say something

I'm open wide, open wondering
Have you swallowed everything
Pay me in kind

James- say something"

So i gave Julian his gift and the note, and I talked to him about it on the phone, and he said that he is attracted to me intellectually wise, but he has a girlfriend and he says that he doesn't plan on breaking up with her anytime soon.. Oh well, I guess that's how it is sometimes. So yesterday I went to the wrestling match with Diane and I saw Robert in his uniform......it was pleasant. I wanted to hang out with him today after school but he is leaving for Texas, but he said we might could spend time together when he gets back next week.......I don't know his personality enough, but the note he gave me today gave me a different impression of what I had of him before, so that is good. I went to Hot Topic with Diane and Amie and I saw a Smiths minidress that I have to buy ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

They had nice tennis apparel, but of course tennis apparel isn't cheap, and I found a pair of tennis shorts I wanted for $45 and a dress I liked for $70....there was no chance of me spending that kind of money. I went into the golf simulator to watch my little brother and my dad play golf....my dad is so good at golf, he is good at every sport, kind of makes me sick.....and plus I stayed in there a while since the guy running the simulator was quite attractive. Then, we went to Chesapeake and Sam and I purchased the following cds: The Cure-disintegration, My Bloody Valentine-loveless, Morrissey-you are the quarry, The Shins-chutes too narrow, Modest Mouse-good news for people who love bad news, and Yo La Tengo-and then nothing turned itself inside-out. When we went into Volume the guy was playing My Bloody Valentine and even though I wasnt planning on spending any money, I just had to buy Loveless, so now I have Loveless and Isn't Anything. Guess what......?........I might be going to Curiosa....woot!....the cure, interpol, mogwai, the rapture, muse, etc....!.....and I hope to see Longwave on June 16 in Norfolk at ""The New Belmont"".....I had never heard of this place until I was looking at pollstar last night....hmm..interesting."

Of course Jessica was freaking about not getting her fake lashes in very well and having a hard time, and then before they walked out the door she was like, ""Omg, I think I just broke my dress!""...wtf, she is stupid. She has freaked out at every prom since 9th grade. I didnt like Laura or Jessica's dress, but Laura's was better. Jessica's hair looked awful imo, but her makeup looked good I guess. Kate, Scottie, and all the rising seniors.....I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN 80S THEME PROM!.....we will play 80s music and everything....it would be great! We can still play 80s hip hop, but it was more tolerable back then. and we can play lots of depeche mode, the cure, new order, some duran duran, some aha, talking heads.....lots of goodies."

I mean, one time, she asked him to look for some hotels in London on the internet because she was planning a trip to London, and he said he couldnt help her, and she went off on him....wtf? I dont know what is wrong with her, but I need to get to the bottom of this....anyways, my stomach hurts like hell right now and I hope it improves soon. One more day of school this week and I can try to maybe get some sleep.....this week's sleep quality so far has been shit. I looked up the mall in Columbia on the internet today at school and it seems pretty decent so maybe if we have time when we are up there we will do a little bit of shopping. I read this great article in NEWSWEEK today about how rock music is changing and they talked about a lot of great bands...it made me happy."

So in Biology we watched a movie called Gattaca. I really enjoyed it, well, partly due to the fact that it has Jude Law in it, but also because it was an ace movie. My parents are supposed to be going out to eat tommorow, so maybe they will rent some movies for Samantha and I to watch- I was thinking Mullholand Drive and Gattaca(Sam wants to see it). I have been wanting to watch Mullholand Drive for quite some time now but have never got around to it. I am going to be eating alot tommorow during school. In first period English with Mrs. Corprew, we are having a huge breakfast in which I am not bringing anything because, well, I have nothing to bring without making something and I am definately not going to make any food. Then, in 4th period Civics with Mrs. Needham, we are having Bojangles chicken with biscuits, french fries, etc, because we fight and argue alot in that class, and she told us if we are good for a week she will bring us lunch......haha, it worked.

I said:
Big Bird seems to care more about children than Bush.

then, somebody said something about the tiny bit of job growth, and then

I said:
The economy isn't the only thing I care about.....I do not like having bigot cowboys with the IQ of my dead hamster running the country.

Megatron said:
Bush cares more about them than Kerry. Kerry is for any kind of abortion there is.

Megatron said:
you don't make any sense. if he was dumb the economy would still be in a shitty state. whatever go ahead and vote for Kerry and watch more of your hard earned money go to the government, who will decide to do god knows what with it.

I said:
So Bush being against a woman's right to choose makes up for the lack of funding for education and such? It doesn't work that way.

I said:
You actually think he played a significant role in the job creation of the last month?    And do you know what a majority of those jobs were?

Megatron said:
woman's right to choose to kill a baby who's full grown. for godsake at least have the decency to abort it at a humane stage in development.

Megatron said:
funny how all these Kerry supporters were complaining about there being no jobs and now are the same ones that are like the job growth isn't a big deal  

go ahead and tell me what they are. 

would you rather not have a job at all and be jobless and homeless?

I said:
Flipping burgers at Mcdonalds isn't going to make up for a job you lost under the Bush admininstration that paid twice as much. I don't think you can start becoming excited about job growth yet, it needs to be more consistent and a longer period of time, more than a month.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I hate it when people say they won't have a job under Kerry's leadership. You don't know that, but we do know that the incubent is a cunt and won't even debate with Kerry because he is scared of him. Kerry is willing to offer the american people quality debates that we deserve, but Bush of course knows in that puney brain of his that he will look like a complete moron."

Oh I don't think anyone understands how much I love blue cheese, it is the best tasting food ever! I had a chicken parmesan sandwich with french fries and it kicked my ass....I forced myself to finish it because I absolutley hate wasting food. There was a kind of cute waitor working there so I was looking at him half of the time. A group of prom people came in and sat at the table in front of us...I thought it seemed a bit early for prom. Anyway, all of the girls but one looked like they had been laying in the tanning bed ever since they were born, their faces looked like sand paper. Their dresses were really ugly too...:-) I got my pictures back yesterday from the concert and they are ok I guess. I am going to try to put them up on the internet hopefully tommorow or Sunday because I am too tired to start now. I am finally going shopping tommorow....woot woot! And I am going to probably get a few cds.......that always make me happy for a little while. Today in Mrs. Needham's class I put this on the board: Hidden motto of the death penalty: ""We teach people not to kill by, well, killing people."" and of course a bunch of people were like no, i disagree, and of course they wouldn't ellaborate either....figures. Crystal Brown fucking praises it because Texas embraces the death penalty and she thinks Texas is damn heaven so of course she disagreed.....yuck. Then, Kat Reppert put something on the board saying something like, ""I agree, considering they hire assasins, you pay them with your tax money."" and mrs. needham was like you are not supposed to know that, but it is true. I always knew Kat was smart and in the right mind like me...hehe....and everyone thinks she is some crazy lesbian....she is nice and she knows what she is talking about so all of the status hungry assholes in the school can kiss my ass. Then, she put on the board about how the bible had been narrowed down througout the years by monarchies of kings and queens when they didnt like what something said in the bible until it became what people think it is now and how it had tons of details about alot of controversial issues such as homosexuality and the death penalty. Most of the people in the class starting poking fun at her and being mean to her and I just kept on writing my thoughts. I also put to add to what Kat said about the assasins, ""Alot of pro-death penalty people state that they do not want to pay tax money to keep criminals alive in prison. I guess they don't know about paying tax money for this.""  and then another one i put was, ""The bible teaches us to forgive. I never believed forgiving translated to wishing death upon that person."" A little while ago, TK popped up on msn and asked me if i really believed in what i was saying in class, and i said yes, and he said he agreed with what i said....ok, so far there are 3 people with sense in my ELP class."

Yes, let's teach society not to kill eachother by, well, killing eachother. I don't think you should have a conversation about something you know very little about."" I don't EVER want to live in Texas, EVER. The same people that backed me up about how shitty Bush is were praising the death penalty. Bush set the record for the the most death row inmates killed during his term as governor of Texas, so obviously most of the people in my class are complete idiots.

The Verve- bittersweet symphony
The Beatles- the long and winding road
Feeder- forget about tommorow
U2- I still haven't found what I'm looking for
REM- The Great Beyond
REM- Nightswimming
Coldplay- brothers and sisters
Crowded House- don't dream it's over
The Flaming Lips- Do you realize?

That really bothered me considering I was doing that the whole fucking time. Anyway, I said, ""I have been doing that the whole time."" and she said, ""Don't get an attidude with me."" and i said, ""I don't have to do what you say, you aren't my parent."" and then i threw the tiny tiny tiny piece of ice into the sink and she was like, ""don't do that, it gets everywhere."" she is just so fucking stupid. and then she said, ""Go work out."" and i said, ""No, I don't need to.""(even though i do), and then she said, ""I beg to differ."" and then i screamed, ""Why don't you get a mind of your own you fucking conformist!"" now i have to dry dishes for two weeks.....i really don't like my sister.....i can't wait until she leaves....Samantha and I are going to throw a party.

I looked at the door posters and it said the show was sold out and I was like......ok, it wasn't last time I checked which had been pretty recent. Anyways, Braden couldn't go with us so we found a scalper who bought her ticket for $30. We were one of the first people in line and we would have had first row but 10 minutes before they let us all in they told everyone that was 21 or over they could go ahead and come in if they want, so I got screwed over. At the beginning of the gig, I was in the 4th row, and I think I ended up in like the 6th or 7th.....! My dad went up to the balcony and left me and Sam by ourselves. I had to listen to these middle aged people talk about The White Stripes being the greatest band.....they better have been fucking joking. Ok, so The Sounds come out and the girl (I forget her name) is so cute and everything. They are really good and the keyboardist was super attractive. After the Sounds, we wait for a while and my sister and I strike up a conversation with this cool half drunk blonde lady behind us who thought I was 20 or 21 and even her sober friends thought the same. By this time, my feet are killing me because I decided to be a dumbass like last show and wear heels. The Strokes come out and umm, they fucking rocked. Julian was super hott and I got plenty of pictures of him. He dove into the audience and I ALMOST touched him. It's a good thing he wasn't right on top of me because I would have unclothed the man. They played The Clash's ""Clampdown"" and it was really good. He asked us if 96x was a good station and we said, ""HELL NO, IT SUCKS!"" During the last song of the night ""Last Night"", he climbed onto the speakers and climbed onto the left side of the balcony section and started kissing people and going insane....it was great. Oh yeah, and Fab needs a bit of a haircut, and they are all super awesome."

"event","1. Why THANK YOU to the all mighty Mooneer for tagging this friend. I will remember this well, oh very well indeed. *sharpens knife* 

2. I own a nightlight. I've slept on the floor of my suite mates' room once or twice because I was too chicken to walk back to my room and fumble my way to bed in the dark. 

   I don't shave my legs. Ewwww disgusting y'all must think, but I don't have hair  so there's not point to shaving. I nagged a friend to show me what normal unshaved legs look like and she gave in. It was..... eye popping. She refused to show it to me again.  
  
   I'm a cat person. Not that I don't like dogs, but I prefer to own a pet cat because you got to graduatlly earn their trust. 

   I don't like ranch, avocado, carbonated drinks, or alcholic beverages. 

  
   And finally, errr.. just IM me if you have any other questions. There, I'm done.

3. Tootie, Auggie, Nga, Quynh, Calvin"

"event","I explained to my mom that it's a huge hassle to go home every weekend but she wasn't convinced. She said that I don't do anything down in San Diego anyways, so I might as well come home and hang out with her. As much as I love home, the trips to and fro have been really time consuming. I guess my mom took it as though I don't want to be home and left the scene upset (We were watching T.V in my parents bedroom). I thought she went to the bathroom but after 15 minutes or so she still wasn't back. I got a little worried so I went searching for her. I found my mom on the steps of our back door, clipping her nails. I sat down behind her and asked casually if I can get my nails clipped too. Without turning her head around, she held out the clipper behind her back. Neither did she say a single word. I knew instantly that something was wrong for her to not face me. I continued to act as though everything was still cool and told her my great discovery that Peking sauce is actually Hoisen sauce. My mom replied with the rhetorical ""really?"" in that melancholy tone. A few seconds later, she got up, turned around and walked briskly past me into the house. That was when I got a glimpse of her teary red eyes."

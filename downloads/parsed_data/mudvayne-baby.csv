"event","Well I finally got myself home last night, cuddled with my kittens, cleaned up some kitty poop and pee (apparently Apollo still thinks the floor is the litterbox), did my dishes, and went to bed.  I tossed and turned as usual.  I hate this.  Why can't I sleep well?  Even on my days off I toss and turn half the night.  ""Normal"" or no, I hate it.  I am growing ever more restless for this little baby to get the hell out of me.  They say that's ""normal"", too. 

I've got one of those head things where its not quite light-headedness, but not quite a head-ache.   Its some hybrid of both.  Really bothersome.  I hope that today is not as full of bullshit as yesterday because today I likely won't be able to hold my tongue or my temper.  

But this week is looking to be my last week.  Thank ye Gods.  By the appearance of things so far, I should be able to make the money I need before I go on maternity leave.  And I need to go on maternity leave.  No one who's as pregnant as I am should have to get out of bed at 7AM to but up with bullshit everyday and not return home until close to 10PM (provided I'm actually out of here on time).  How I'm doing it, I don't know.  But since I've been in Ottawa, I have been working really hard and being much more a responsible adult than I ever have in my whole life.  I just don't know how I'm doing it. 

Nothing much new.  So far, one booking, which is pretty good for 10AM.  Hopefully he shows up, that's $20 for me.  Yay.  Looking to be a good week.  I've been doing a lot of praying that I will make good money this week so I can finally take some time to rest my weary body.  Yesterday was lucrative, and I think the rest of the week will follow that trend.  

I also had a chat with my body about labor.  I told it to get itself prepared as soon as its ready so that the final stages of labor will be shorter and less painful.  I think my body agreed with me, as I have the distinct feeling I have begun to dialate.  I'm about two and a half weeks from my due date, but if I slowly start dialating now, by the time I'm in real labor, I'll already be mostly dialated and its less painful because its not so sudden.  I have a good body.  

That's about it.  Tired, cranky, feels like someone filled my head with helium and then dropped a couple lead weights in the bottom of it.  And I've got to pee..."

"event","Okay, well today turned out to be a very strange day.  I got to work, no one was here.  Odd....  Finally a couple girls come in.  One is a 19 year old open minded blond.  The other is a 25 year old (she's really 42) NOT open minded carribean girl.  Gee, I wonder which one the guys will want to see?  Of course she gets pissy when the guys pick the younger lady over her.  Well that's the nature of the biz, honey.  Tough titty.  She's been throwing attitude and being a royal pain in the ass.  Now there's four ladies on, two that are young, busty and really nice girls, and two that are a bit older, not as busty (not as pretty in my honest opinion, either) and no where near as nice.  They are in the other room being gossipy like a pair of thirteen year olds.  Well I don't like the way Morrigan answers the phones, blah blah blah.  Well fuck, sorry, but if the client asks who's the youngest, I tell them.  I'm fair.  I describe who I have on and let the client choose.  Men like younger women, that's just the way it is.  I don't need to sit here and have two little bitches, one of whom I just met a few minutes ago, sitting in the other room being all gossipy and bitchy.  Fuck them.  I could use the extra money, true, but I don't need it bad enough to get up early, come in to work, and have to put up with old hags thinking they should get more calls than the young girls.  Its simply not the way things work.  Period.  So sorry, but maybe if you're 42 and still working, you should re-evaluate your life.  There's something wrong there, methinks.  

So I'm crabby, tired, and not looking forward to this drama repeating itself.  If I come in tomorrow and its the same shit, I'll probably walk right back out again.  I don't need the extra money bad enough to endure all this bullshit.  Not for $20 or $40 a day.  No way Jose.  

So we'll see what happens.  I've never had problems with any of the girls aside from this little snob, and now she's got a sidekick who already is gossiping behind my back, and she doesn't even know me.  And to top it off, one of the other phone ladies is being unreliable and is under suspect of recruiting for her black boyfriend (who's pretty much a pimp from what I understand).  Why am I being dragged into this?  I don't know.  But I'm drawing ever nearer to the point where I just don't care.  Its simply not worth it.  I take it day by day.  Today isn't so bad.  Tomorrow might be better, it might be the same, it might be worse.  I'll deal with it as it comes.  But man, am I getting fed up with the non-stop bullshit, drama and immaturity around here.  I have never in my life worked for such a disorganized agency.  And I've worked for a few in my time.  This agency is poorly managed.  The girls do not have a set schedule (which is unheard of), and there is a lack of consistency in management that needs rectifying.  But who am I to say anything?  I'm just the phone lady.  I haven't been in the biz for six years.  I haven't run my own place.  I've got no clue what the best way to have order and respect (and a successful business) is.  No, of course not.  I'm just the pregnant phone lady.  Fucking morons.  When I'm skinny again, I'll show them how its done.  I'll be making a grand a week, easy, and they'll all be here wondering why the phones aren't ringing."

"event","I have not posted on here in a very long time.  I read the last few entries to get an idea where I left off.  I am on here for the benefit of one, so here's the gist of what has happened since my last real post in August. 

Billy and I went to hell.  Like no one saw it coming.  Of course it went to hell.  He never really wanted to date me again, and was really just lonely and wanting to get laid.  I never should have let myself fall for him again.  I paid the price by getting knocked up by him.  He totally denies this, of course, damaging as it is to his precious self-image.  I didn't know for sure until October that I was pregnant, but I knew within days of conception.  You just know you're own body.  

So I was having a hell of a time in Victoria during the month of October.  I enrolled in Sprott-Shaw Community College, and was taking a course in elderly care.  Oh god, the name of the course escapes me.  Anyhow that was not going well because part of the ""course"" that had no academia elements to it whatsoever was something I strongly disagreed with.  They wanted me to fill out these silly charts that essentially boiled the complex array of human emotions down to A or B.  It was just like Donnie Darko.  I wrote an essay to the director explaining why I felt this was wrong and even offered to do something else since I refused to participate.  They flat out refused, told me it was part of the course.  I asked them why it was so relevant when I could not make out any relevance.  They got grumpy that I was thinking outside the box, and eventually I got kicked out of the course.  The funny thing about that is I got kicked out on my first day of the REAL course, where we did a pop quiz, and I got 100%.  No one else got 100%.  Goes to show that they obviously cater to morons who don't have the brain capacity to see the box they're being stuffed into.

So I was upset about that, upset about Billy being an asshole (basically he was in North Carolina - or South, I disremember - on a course for a couple weeks, and he met this girl and they were going to drive down to Florida on the weekend to see a show.  I had a problem with this, naturally, and he threw a hissy fit and broke up with me.  I'm too jealous.  Well, he never took me out, hid me from his friends, and now is taking off to spend a weekend with some chick he just met?  Right).  Life was not so good.  I got confirmation of the pregnancy, and was really at a loss for where to take my life.

Enter Crystal.  She's my best friend of about 12 years.  We had a bit of a falling out, and weren't talking.  Funny that she pops back into my life when I needed a friend.  We got talking again, I filled her in on my life, she filled me in on hers.  She asked me why don't I just move to Vancouver with her?  I thought, why don't I?  So the very next day, she caught the ferry over, helped me move my stuff and that was that.  This was November 8th or 9th.  

I was planning on getting an abortion, and in truth, should have had one.  But shit always ended up coming up, or the clinic was booked full and I'd have to wait three weeks for an appointment.  Things just weren't going that way.  I worked at a massage parlor while in Vancouver, and was very happy with Crystal.  She and I had the chance not only to mend our friendship, but to have it flourish into an adult friendship full of understanding and love.  

I finally had an abortion set to go in the States.  This was in late Feb.  I was about five months pregnant.  Vancouver was so busy with so many people getting abortions that I always managed to just miss an open spot for an appointment.  While this was going on, I was corresponding with Billy - who still had all my worldy possessions in his apartment.  We were trying to arrange a time and date for me to come get my things.  In the end, he never replied my e-mail for a few weeks, and by the time he did, he said he already threw my things out.  We had no landline, and calling him was unrealistic.  I said so in an e-mail and he never did call us.  He blames it on me, as he does with everything else that goes awry that he doesn't feel like sharing responsibility for.  So all my crystals, all my family photos, everything of value to me  was thrown out.  I'll leave it up to you to decide who's in the wrong.  

So he comes to Vancouver to take me down to Seattle for the procedure.  It didn't go through. They wouldn't give me sufficient drugs and the pain was too great.  When I told them I'll take whatever drugs they will give me, they had already made up their minds to refuse me.  I was so upset I wanted to cry, but I refused to show any weakness in front of Billy, who I knew would be totally unsympathetic - as always.  The drive back to Vancouver was long, awkward, but thankfully silent.  My mind was reeling with what to do.  

My happy days living with Crystal in Vancouver were coming to an end.  This was all on the 26th of Feb.  By the time the 3rd of March came, I had my three bags which contained everything I own packed and was waiting for my friend to pick me up and take me to the airport.  I was flying to Ottawa.

I had done a search on Google to look into adoption, just to get an idea of what its about and how its done.  I stumbled onto a website where I came across the profile of one Don and Sarah.  I read through their profile (and a good many others) and something about them just stood out.  By far.  They're perfect, I thought.  And what's more, they live in Toronto, which is close to Ottawa.  At this point I was weighing my options of whether to A) go back to Victoria; B) stay in Vancouver; C) go to Calgary with Crystal; or D) go to Ottawa.  Ottawa held the most for me because I have two friends here.  Seeing the profile for Don and Sarah swayed me.  The next day, with Crystal's credit card's help, I booked a flight to Ottawa.

I left on March 3rd.  I have not looked back.  My first days here were interesting.  I was staying in a women's shelter, and was totally unfamiliar with the city.  Having two friends turned out to make all the difference.  It took me a couple weeks, but I was able to get work, and orient myself in the downtown area.  I got on the list for subsidized housing and finally moved into my own place on my birthday, May 3rd.  Two months to the day after arriving.  

I have since quit my jobs, and am now only working an under the table job as a receptionist for an escort agency.  I am otherwise on maternity leave.  I am not rich, and my apartment is sparsely decorated, but I'm happy.  Happier than I've been since I can remember.  I live close to good people, whom I am forging friendships with.  I have two kittens who adore me and I them.  And I have the feeling of giving something to two people that will forever bless and change their lives.  It will be hard, but it is best.  

So that's me up to date.  Its been a hard road, full of loss, but also a road of renewal and change.  I'm happy it all turned out this way.  Granted, I'm still a bit pissed that Billy so casually threw my things out (mostly I'm sad about my crystals and my family photos), but in the end it gives me a chance to really start fresh.  I'm optimistic.  And happy.  It takes more than an asshole ex and a pregnancy to get this girl down!

I'm at work right now, getting shit from one of the girls because I didn't promote her on the phone.  Well, when someone calls and asks for someone young, specifically someone young, I'm not promoting a 25 year old because its fruitless.  But whatever.  This girl drives me nuts and I could care less.  She's snobby and annoying.  Fuck her.  If someone wants someone young, well sorry honey, but you ain't young.  She's really 42 or 43.  I'm not passing her as anything younger than 24, and for most guys, that's too old.  So sad too bad.

Looking forward to Crystal coming for my baby's birth.  She's booked a flight so she'll be arriving at one in the afternoon on the 27th.  I'm due on the 25th, but the first one is almost never on time, let alone early.  And I have a hunch he'll be coming out on the 28th.  Same as the hunch I had that I was pregnant in the first place, and the hunch that I just knew it was a boy.  I trust my guts.  So the 28th it will be, I reckon.  And besides, even if its not, I can get induced.  I'll be past my due date, and there's no problems with inducing me.  

Not much else going on.  Its probably going to be another stupidly hot day in this stupidly hot and humid province.  I'll be getting an AC unit on the weekend.  And a queen size air mattress.  It will be better than the single foam bed on the floor I'm sleeping on.  I just hope this week at work is kind to me and I can make an extra hundred or two.  Then I can take my cats to the vet and get them a much needed deworming.  Vaccinations can wait, but they need to be dewormed if they're going to keep developing and growing properly.  We'll see what the week brings."

"event","Just checking to see if anyone still reads this one.  I have a different one now and the only person I can think who might still read this one from time to time is the very man I have mourned for for the past fourteen months.  You know exactly who you are, and all I have to say is that I hope that you are reading this and that you know how much I suffer for my wrong doing.  I have no other purpose in my life now but to find you and kneel before you and beg forgiveness.  I have never felt more regret over anything in my whole life.  Nothing even close.  I promised you I would come, and I am coming.  I will honour my promise to you even if you are no longer there to witness it.  I shall look for you and hope and pray that I will find you.  I do not hold any hope or expectation for how I will be received, however.  But know, my darling, that although I have faltered, I have a new conviction to try to absolve my dishonour.  I haven't words to describe how I feel for you.  No word I know is strong enough, determined enough or gentle enough to encapsulate my adoration of you.  I still think of you daily, and I still dream the sweetest dreams that break my heart when I wake to discover that dreams is all they were.  My heart still aches as much as ever for you.  I miss your tangled hair, your smelly green and yellow hat, the way you would look at me sometimes with a light dancing in your eyes.  I even miss you when you've had too much to drink.  I will keep to my word, even if it is a pointless pursuit."

"event","Sweet... I am now living with Billy.  Holy crap Batman!  That was fast, I know.  We are so happy together, though.  He asked me to move in a couple days ago, so I said yes.  How bad could it be?  I have been practically living here since last Monday anyways.  And I think he got hooked on me cooking him breakfast and dinner every day.  *evil plan is working*  It's been great.  We get up at around 6AM, I cook breakfast, and we sit and chill out with a cup of tea and have a smoke and chit chat, then he's off to work, and I am left here to play on the computer or play vids.  I can't think of a better set-up.  Besides, I'm used the hostel life where you've got at least 30-200 roomies at any given time.  Having one person around will be nothing!  I rearranged his kitchen a couple days ago, and now I can actually find what I'm looking for when I cook.  He never used any of his pots and pans until I strolled in and started cooking up a storm.  Later this week, maybe on the weekend, we're gonna go get my supplies: 10lbs of flour, 10lbs of granulated sugar, 5lbs of golden (brown) sugar, baking soda, baking powder, baking chocolate, a pastry bag/icing bag thingie, a cake stand, and some more baking sheets and pans.  Yay for cooking!!!  

Speaking of which, I made the best brownies ever a few days ago.  Oh my God were they good.  Its the recipe on the Baker's unsweetened chocolate baking squares.  The only difference is that instead of shitty old walnuts (which I abhor) I used pecans and I added in some of those Chipits Skor bits.  Soooo good.  It's a pretty easy recipe, too.  One Bowl Brownies its called and for those who might want it, you can find it on the Kraft website.  I'm gonna bring some in for people on the weekend.  

Billy bought a deep frier!  Oh, I could shit I'm so stoked!  I finally got my mothers recipe for donuts last time I was over there and I can't wait to make some.  They are so yummy, and I will be bringing some of those in for people on the weekend, too.  I'm in my element here.  Tasty treats for all!  

What else...?  I skipped work yeseterday.  I am probably in trouble for that.  I don't know.  I don't want to go to work anymore.  Not that I really did before, but even less so now.  But Billy's getting me a front door key (have to get them from the landlord) today so I can come and go with a little more freedom.  I'm going to mull around here until 11 or so, then head into work.  Pretty much back to my old way of doing it.  Stay at work until 7, then Billy will pick me up and that will be that.  I could get very used to this.  

Billy and I are going to Halifax later this month, too.  He's got to go do some sailing and I wanted to go there to work, so it fits quite well.  We'll be there for a couple months, then we've got to come back to Victoria and look for a new apartment, then go to Newfoundland for a buddy's wedding, then to Sasksatoon to see my family, then we're off to Scotland, Ireland and Britain come September.  He's got training in Britain, and we're going to visit some of my friends in Ireland and his family in Scotland while we're over there.  Going to be a busy year for us.

Well, its like 8AM right now and I think I want to lay down and get some more sleep.  Maybe play some vids if I find I'm tossing and turning.  *so sleepy*  Got a new shirt yesterday, will wear it out on Friday.  He he he...  it's pink, but that's not even the best part!  Bwa ha ha ha...."

Well it's official now, and although its a shitty situation we really like each other alot and we're not ready to just drop what we've got.  We hung out lots this week (I practically live here now) and we spend lots of time making each other laugh and shit.  We weren't really planning on this happening, I think that's the bitch-kitty of it all.  We were just going to hang out for coffee and that was it.  But we really hit it off and it turns out we have so much in common, and we read each other's minds all the time.  

Billy and I agreed that we should try to meet up with Jared for coffee to talk to him about it and let him know that Billy and I are dating.  Well, I called him from Billy's this afternoon and he didn't sound amused.  All three of us were most worried about it affecting the relationships we have with each other.  I especially don't want Jared and Billy to have bad blood over this.  But really, what can be done?  Last I heard from Jared, he said he'd deal with it as best he could.  Well I hope he meant it because he's gotta deal.  I don't want to sound like a bitch, but really, he needs to deal.  He dumped me - many months ago - and he can't still pull the ownership/territory thing on me.  I'm not his anymore and yes it sucks that I'm falling for a friend of his, but it happens.  You can't control how you feel.  Billy and I are trying to be mature and sympathetic to not only how Jared feels, but why.  I just hope Jared can understand that not only have I moved on and he should, too, but that feelings can't be controlled.  Kicking up a fuss won't do much.  Might take some stress off your shoulders, but that's about it.  I hope that the three of us can work this through.  Maybe just some time.  A couple weeks or something.  Sometimes it just takes adjusting.  

Other than that, not much new.  Been having fun with Billy.  Haning out, meeting his friends, cooking him dinner and shit.  Speaking of which.... I should probably go do that.... poker later, and we should eat before everyone gets here.  Hope everyone is well and I will update later."

"event","Okay, so had yesterday off (thank God!).  Hung out, didn't do much.  Went out with a buddy (who might be my new beau, we'll see) and eventually went to Evo.  Me and said person get out of the cab together and Jared was outside and shot us a dirty look.  Uh-oh.  Nothing happened yet but he's got his hackles up.  Shit!  Drink lots, have a great night and Jared invites me over for video games... my achilles' heel.  Have to decline, said boy needs a nurse for the night.  Shit, fuck, cock, balls!  Don't want to hurt or offend anyone, but have to make a choice.  We all walk to Jared's and Jared and I talked and I cried and we were both hurt and sad and not wanting to deal with the situation, but we knew we must.  So he said it was cool, he'd deal.  Okay, **half sigh of temporary relief**  sort-of.  Go back to buddy's place.  Spend the night talking and laying in bed.  No sleep.  Got up early so he could go to work, headed into town to get myself ready for work.  Feeling like crap.  Get to work, chat with the girls after not seeing them for over a week.  Not much different.  Jared calls me.  Wants to do coffee.  I go over to his place and we didn't really end up talking about much, but we just kind of sat there and cuddled and wished to God things could be different (I am pretty sure I can speak for both of us on that one).  Walked together partway into town again, and I had to go back to work.  Don't want to hurt Jared, hell no, but can't help feelings.  So hard to cope with.  Jared's in a tough spot and so am I.  We're trying to be sensitive to each other in this, but its still going to be hurtful to both of us.  We're still not over each other yet, that's the issue. We're still very fond of each other.  Oh well... it will resolve itself, I suppose.  

Thank you eddyzen for finding my lost marbles.  I was happy you remembered.  I would be nothing without my marbles!  And thank you to Jared for continuing to be not only a good friend but a good man overall.  You nursed me when I was drunk, you nursed me when I was sick, you let me cry on your shoulder, and you endeavoured to understand and accept something that was hard to swallow.  I am very blessed to have such a wonderful man in my life.  From the bottom of a heart that still belongs mostly to you, thank you Jared."

"event","Well, let's see.  Its been a while since I've posted, so I guess there's alot to catch up on.  Just after I posted my last LJ, my boss called me and wanted me to come back down to work to talk to her.  She asked me what was up and I told her that I have been really stressed out lately and I can't seem to shake it.  She gave me a week off.  Okay.  Good part was I got a week off.  Bad part was that I had very little money and had to make due best I could.  It was actually pretty nice.  I laid in bed most of the day and read books and wrote.  I needed it.  On Valentine's Day I was very surprised to get a knock on my door and the front desk staff told me I had recieved a delivery.  It was a big, lovely boquet of flowers from Al.  I was floored.  I had thought he had washed his hands of me since he didn't respond to the e-mails I had sent him.  I called him and he told me he missed me and all this.  So we're at least talking again, which is nice.  I went out on Friday night and got sick.  Great.  Have to be back to work on Sunday and I get fucking sick.  Lovely.  Went out anyways Saturday night.  Jared took care of me that night.  Fed me NeoCitron while I played Zelda.  He can be a real peach when he wants to be.  And today, back at work, I get my period.  God damn it!!  Sick, bleeding and grumpy.  Like I didn't have all week to get sick and bleed, no... let's wait until she has to go back to work then we'll gang up on her.  Nice.  At least I have tomorrow off.  All that time to destress worked, but now I have a whole new pile of shit to trudge through.  Fuck life can really stick it to you sometimes.  But I'm happy at least.  I have good friends who care not only about me but care for me, and I have supportive coworkers and food in my belly.  What else does one need, really?  I have to do some serious fundraising this week, though, so I have my work cut out for me.  But I can do it.  I've been booking up pretty well since a couple weeks ago, so I can't see finances being a problem for me.  But I want to put $2000 in the bank next month, so I'm going to be working more.  And I am still contemplating going to Halifax for a couple weeks to work.  Good money out there from what I heard.  And a change of scenery would be nice.  I'm going to skip off to Tofino in a few weeks and spend a couple days up there.  It would be a nice mini vacation for me.  Well, I'm going to go indulge in a hot bath and a good book.  And I think I'll treat myself to a candybar.  Mmmmmm chocolately goodness!"

"event","Yup... the end is drawing nigh.  I can't get time off even though I'm stressed to the max and I'm sick as all hell (although not bad enough for an antibiotic cocktail    eeew).  I can't bring myself to be chipper and happy at work like I used to be.  And my boss is getting less and less enthusiastic about me.  I can't really blame her, but for Christ's sake if I'm asking for time off, give it to me!!  I NEED it.  Fuck she doesn't see that I need time off more than I need her reprimands.  A few days to myself where I don't have to work would do wonders for me.  But I can't do that because so many other people at work have been flailing out and fucking it up for the rest of us.  **sigh**  Oh well... Life goes ever onwards.  I am going to make a point of going to bed really early today and getting up at 9AM tomorrow, showering and going into work right away.  I'm going to make myself be happy dammit!  We'll see how that works out.  

In other news... not much new.  Dave, some drummer I met last week has been hitting on me like no tomorrow.  He's a nice guy and all, but he's not quite my type.  He came out to Evo last night ""just to see me"" so he says.  He's really infatuated, I think.  **sigh**  I attract the weird ones and the ones that I'm not into that way but all the hotties and good boys are either involved or hiding under a rock somewhere.  Bleh.  Life can stink sometimes.  

I'm contemplating leaving town again.  I know, I know.  I can't sit still anymore.  I am getting really antsy being in Victoria again.  I love it here and I love hanging out with friends and shit, but it just ain't working for me.  It hasn't worked for me in years.  Not sure where the hell I'm going to go, but I am giving serious thought to moving on again.  I don't know.  I don't know what to do with my life these days.  I want to travel more of Canada, and I want to go to Australia and get my degree in nursing (that way I can have access to pretty much any country and be certain of a good job to boot.  Everyone wants nurses, so its a free pass to most of the world that way).  I might talk to the regular day phone lady about her old work place in Halifax.  She said I'd do well there and at least its something new for me.  I get so bored seeing the same shit day in day out.  I used to thrive on familiarity but now I crave unstability and new things constantly.  Daniel really wants me to come to Toronto, so I might do that if only for a few weeks.  It would be good to be with someone who knows me well.  He's really the only person who knows me all that well.  Good, true friends are really hard to find these days.  I should hold more value to the few I do have.  

Okay, so I'm going to go light a candle and do some meditating.  It's been too long since I've done that.  I think that might be part of what's wrong with me.  I've lost that part of myself.  That was my tether.  I need that to stay sane amidst all the stress and drama of my life.  Hopefully I can regain my balance and become more centered again."

"event","Well I have been better at work, not so stressed out.  But now I'm getting sick!  Fuck me!  When will this end?  Gawd...  Today I got called in for an appointment that never showed and then I got sent on an outcall.  I told the phone lady I would need to grab outcall clothes since all I had was jeans and a t-shirt, and I wasn't going to go around in public in my lingere!  Jebus no!!  I finished with the call and the driver told me the phone lady wanted to talk to me.  I called and she said my card was put away for the day because I was ""argumentative"" with her regarding the outcall.  Okay.... whatever.  Full moon, people are weird and cranky and I really don't fucking care.  The drama at work is getting really stale.  It's the same shit always.  Get a new grip or stop bitching about the same shit.  

So last night I went out to Evo.  I wasn't in the best of moods, but I wasn't really bitchy, either.  Just kind of blah.  It was a good night.  Allan saw me and asked how I was and I told him that he didn't want to know.  Later on he saw me and I guess I looked stressed and he went to give me a hug and I backed away from him.  I didn't mean for it to come across as harshly as it seemed to, but he's been jerking me around with going for coffee and shit like that and I have little patience for people who do that.  As most of you know.  If you're not gonna do it then don't tell me you're gonna do it.  So I guess I might have offended him or something.  Oh well... I'll make ammends later tonight.  I had fun with my friends and caught up with a few people I hadn't seen in a while.  Baron celebrated his birthday and my God was he drunk!  The usual crew was out with him and much to my amazement, Baron was on the dancefloor a fair bit that night.  He only really dances when he's been drinking or when he's in a particularly good mood.  Dave, Baron's buddy, invited me to call him and we'll go for dinner.  ""I'll treat you right, lady"" he said.  Oh God.  I like him but not that way, and I want to hang out with him but I don't want to inadvertantly lead him on by calling him for coffee or something.  I dunno... I'll prolly call him and do coffee or something.  Why the hell not?  I'm lonely and any company is good company.  Especially because I know he's a sweet heart and would treat me very well indeed.  

So last week there was some dickweed that came up to my table and slapped me for no reason, right?  I can't remember if I put it in my LJ or not.  Anyhow, the same dillhole was harassing me and my friends again last night.  I was not in the mood to be bothered by idiots (especially after having the same chachi ask me four times to dance and still not getting it).  I was outside and it was near the end of the night.  Both me and my friend told him several times to fuck off and leave us alone.  Allan saw these goings-on and told buddy to just leave us alone.  Buddy didn't get it.  Allan told me that if I wanted to take him ""for a walk"" then go for it.  Sure, I was getting very close, and these days it takes alot to make me want to deck you.  Finally when the bar was closed and everyone was going home or waiting for cabs, he pushed the limit.  I stood up, dropped my purse and took my jacket off.  I guess he didn't clue into what that means and kept beaking off.  I punched him with a right hook.  He got the message.  I feel really bad about hitting him like that, but not even the bouncers could get him to lay the fuck off.  Hopefully from now on he'll leave me and my friends alone.  

For someone so dull and boring I live a pretty eventful life, eh?  Hmmmm.... Oh well.  I am going to make this week my goal for moving into Adam's.  Or at least getting my storage locker paid off and getting the carpets in Adam's place cleaned.  They are so gross!!  I'm probably going to redo the carpets.  I think they're beyond hope.  And I want to redo all the drywall since there's big holes everywhere.  It'll be a good weekend reno project.  A buddy of mine (who's a kickass drummer) is a pro painter, so I can get him to do the job for cheap, maybe even free.  And because my brother Allan is a carpenter, he works with carpet installers, drywallers, tile layers, you name it, so getting him to ask the boys at work if they want to take a small under the table job would probably bring a good handful of people wanting to work.  I figure two men for the carpet, $140 cash in hand each.  It won't take them more than a few hours to get it in, and there's no one that would turn that down.  Drywallers, I don't know.  I will have to get my brother to take a look at what needs to be done and get him to give me an idea of what the boys will work for.  Two boys doing the job shouldn't take more than a day, so $300 each or so.  Tile layers for the bathroom and kitchen... no more than five hours to lay, the grout will take overnight to set, but that's not on their clock.  And that's that.  I can get the whole place done in a weekend, if I wanted to.  Then all's that's left is to rebuild the cabinets in the kitchen and bathroom.  And I want to install new interior doors, as well.  The ones currently in there are ugly as fuck.  I don't like it.  Buying the materials is going to be the expensive part.  I will have to talk more with Adam about what colour of tile, carpets and paints he wants.  I don't want anything too tacky but I want something that has some colour to it.  Maybe a plush hunter green...?  I don't know.  

Well, I should go get something to eat and then have a nap.  Sleepy sick girl...  **sigh**"

"event","Well the staff meeting was interesting.  I had an appointment right when it was set to start, so I missed out on Vikki screaming and yelling with a red face and bulging eyes.  Thank God.  I could stand to miss that anyday.  I've been under enough stress without needing a cranky boss to add to it.  I was really shocked that Vikki didn't make the connection between me asking for time off and my not being able to properly preform at work.  I never ask for time off and usually when I do its for a damned good reason.  But I guess since alot of the other girls have been flailing at work she's had to crack down.  Now you need a doctor's note for time off.  Harsh, eh?  So what am I supposed to do when I am so stressed out that I can't work but I can't get a doctor's note??  I'm fucked.  

So nothing else really new.  I tried calling Al in Australia just to see how he's been.  I told him that I would still like to keep in touch with him but I guess he isn't into it.  Oh well... his loss, not mine.  Talked to Adam and I will be moving into his place over the next few weeks.  I'm going to rent a carpet cleaner for a few days and hopefully that will remove some of the disgusting stains on the carpets.  And I have to look around for a good deal on a pillowtop matress.  I have wanted one for so long, and dammit, I will have one!!  Well, I should get my ass to work already.  Gonna stop at McD's on the way.  Something greasy and slathered in McChicken sauce.... mmmmm....

Hope everyone is well, and I will see some of you tonight..."

"event","Okay, so I met Rob, Alan's friend, right?  We hung out last night after he got off work and we wandered down to the Gorge to hang out and chat.  We talked for a few hours and as it turned out, he was interested in me and wasn't sure if it was reciprocated or not.  I told him that although he wasn't attractive to me in that way, I would totally be down for hanging out more.  Awkward!!  Fuck me, why do I always get stuck in these crappy awkward situations?? 

It was a nice night, though.  We perched on a rock overhanging the water, facing east, and talked for a long while.  A couple of young racoons were playing in a tree right beside us, pausing now and then to peek over the oak's limbs to observe us.  They were really cute.  We went to Timmy Ho's for some hot cocoa afterwards and talked some more.  I ended up getting really tired and called a cab at around 4AM to take me home.  There was no way I was walking when I was that sleepy!  

Just got up now, and about half an hour ago (5PM or so) my phone rings.  I answer it still half asleep.  It was **shock** Alan.  He was really the last person I was expecting to hear from.  He apologised for not getting ahold of me earlier, and I said no problem since he's got alot on his plate.  He asked if he woke me up and I said yes, but I should be up anyways since its practically dinner time, and I had no reason to sleep so far into the day.  He said that he would ""call me back in a bit"".  I said ""okaaay..."" and that was that.  He's a strange one, he is.  I don't understand him at all and his behaviour is always so incongruent and sporatic.  But he's a cool guy and I consider him a friend.  I wonder what possessed him to call...??

My day off today.  Thank ye Gods.  I am not doing much of anything but I am going to go out to Evo to see if Alan is out later on.  There's a staff meeting at work tomorrow and I am really scared about what its going to be about.  I think I know, though.  Too many girls showing up late, not showing for their shifts, not having a legit reason to miss a shift or take time off and making sure we are sweet as pie to our johns.  I keep getting the funny feeling that I'm going to get fired at the meeting.  But we'll see.  I've been under a lot of stress and I think if I were to get fired, I would have been fired by now - unless Vikki is going to make an example of me in front of everyone, which she does do on occasion.  I don't know.  I'm going to try not to think about it.  I was hoping to go to the park to feed the squirrels today, but I guess it's a little too late, now.  

Got my laundry done last night and I cleaned my room.  At least I am feeling more human these days.  I hope it lasts...  Well, I'm going to putter around and try to not watch the phone.  I hate when people call like that out of the blue, for no apparent reason and then just as abruptly run off with the promise of calling back later.  Grrr...."

"event","After a bender that lasted a week and a half, I seem to be doing much better.  I woke up Monday morning feeling not half bad, and I woke up again this morning feeling better.  I hope to God this spell of darkness is lifted because I'm suffering badly because of it.  

I'm about to lose my job because I can't work like I am.  But the bitch of it is that my boss won't give me time off unless I can get someone to cover my shift, which is nigh impossible.  So basically I can go to work and get complaints because I'm not able to work properly, or I can get fired.  The complaints will get me fired, too, I should add.  So its not like I have many options.  There's a staff meeting on Thursday, and I have the funny feeling that I'm going to be singled out for a few things.  I just wish my boss could see that I was very very stressed out and giving me time off shouldn't make me more stressed than I already was.  She made the situation worse in many ways, but I guess it doesn't matter now.  It's been done and it can't be undone.  

Other than that, things have been great.  I walked Alan from Evo home on Sunday night and we ended up hanging out with a buddy of his for a couple hours.  Rob, is the buddy's name.  Rob gave me his number and I called him the next day to say thanks for having me over, and to give him my number (which I forgot to do).  He called me today and we've got plans to meet up after he's done at work.  Alan still hasn't called me for coffee even though every time I see him, he swears up and down that he will...  I guess some people are more preoccupied than others.  Its forgivable considering his circumstance, which I will not be divulging.  

Last night I went out to Evo again, hoping Alan would come out with his hair spiked as he said he would do.  He didn't end up coming out, but whatever.  I had a good night chatting with Suzie, Jared and Marcus.  It was a good night.  I went home and stopped by seven eleven to grab some chips and dip to nibble on.  Just as I settled in and got comfy, the phone rings.  It was Jared.  He was calling to say goodnight to me.  How sweet, I thought, that he would do something so randomly.  I asked why he thought to do that, and he said that he was slicing up some ham and mustard to munch on and it reminded him of me.  He invited me over and we watched some CSI while pigging out on ham and mustard and chips and dip.  It was great.  I actually got more than four hours sleep that night, too.  He woke me up at about 1:30 or something.  Nice of him to let me sleep in like that.  He can be so sweet when he wants to be.  

Craig had called me, and when I went to call him back, there was no answer.  I went downtown to Shopper's with Jared and I got some new shampoo and conditioner (joico rocks!!  my hair is like silk!), some shave gel and a new toothbrush and floss.  Jared had to jet after that, so I walked towards the hostel.  I spotted a tall black man across the street, and lo who should it be but Craig!  I darted over the traffic and he didn't really look all that surprised to bump into me.  He confessed that he had the funny feeling we'd run into each other.  We walked towards James Bay, and finally he asked me if I knew where we were going.  I said no, did he know?  No.  We laughed and turned around to go to Rising Star for some coffee.  Marcus popped in and the three of us sat and talked for a while.  I shared the news with Craig that I would be moving in with Adam.  

I'm happy about that.  My own quiet place, and a crazy room-mate.  I can have a cat again, and a comfortable bed.  I'm going to buy one of those plush pillow-top matresses, and get some soft 300+ thread count sheets.  Ah... so nice!  

I've got to go see a friend from the hostel play later on.  She's going to the Bent Mast to play her fiddle.  It's her last night here and although I've been on the go all day, I owe it to her to come by if only for an hour or so.  I've got to meet up with Rob at just past 11 tonight, so I've got two hours to do that.  And I'm in the middle of doing laundry.  So I have to rush to the Bent Mast, then rush back here to finish my laundry, and then hop over to Alzu's to meet Rob.  Such a busy day!!

I am really stoked on my new life.  I seem to be much better at making friends than I was before.  I am actually calling people and meeting up with them.  Its a great feeling.  There's positive things happening to me underneath all that shit that I was just going through.  I am content again.  Work is really the only stress factor for me.  I am really nervous about work these days because I know that my boss is wearing thin herself, which makes her all the harder to deal with.  But there's not much I can do but try to stay happy and chipper when I'm with clients and hope for the best.  

I should get going soon since time is wearing thin.  Socail rounds will be the end of me!!"

"event","The only redeeming factor of today was that the sun was actually out for a while without rain and wind.  I got up and went to work only to go back home again as soon as I was done my appointment.  I wasn't in the mood at all to be there, and I probably would have ripped some poor bloke's balls off just for looking at me sideways.  I really wan't in the mood for much of anything today.  I don't really know what's up.  I feel like I'm somehow on the outside of all this.  Like there's some other part of my brain taking over and I have to sort of sit back and watch as my body gets hijacked.  It's really weird.  I ended up sleeping in after getting back from Chinatown.  Mmmmm BBQ pork on rice!  Yummy for my tummy.  

Slept and had another weird dream.  It stems from a conversation me and the girls at work had earlier.  

Vikki, the boss, was in last night while I was painting my wooden wish boxes.  I had been answering phones for almost five hours by that point, and I was really trying to focus on getting my boxes painted.  Vikki looks at me and asks if I was doing meth.  I stopped dead and looked at her and said ""where the hell did you get that from?"".  Sure, little miss never ever done coke or E is gonna go smoke a big fat bowl of meth.  What the flying fuck was that about?  I couldn't believe it.  I haven't been myself lately, true, but is it that big of a difference from how I usually am??  

So after my call today, I went into the staff room to have a smoke, and we got talking about stress and drugs and shit like that.  I told them that I was diagnosed with something that wasn't severe enough to be manic-depressive, but wasn't really just depression either.  I told them its been a long time - years now - since I've really had a bout of it that I couldn't shake off.  The girls all started sharing all these things about themselves and we ended up talking, the three of us and the phone lady, about all kinds of shit.  Like how abuse in the childhood is often used as an excuse for being a drug-head or a rapist or whatever.  How different parenting techniques are harmful in their own ways.  How drugs affect you and why they started doing them at various points in their lives and what hastened them to quit.  It was really interesting to have such a conversation.  We had never shared ourselves like that before with each other.  It cheered me up in a weird way.  

So I had a nap this afternoon, and in my dream one of the girls from work, who I was doing the most talking with, was sitting in my room and telling me that she was worried if we started to not be able to focus anymore.  I had no clue what the fuck she was talking about.  It was odd.  Then the dream progressed into something else and I was driving with Alan, the Evo doorman, and some random people.  The random people turned into some big burly black man and my eldest brother, Mike.  And the car turned into everyone walking and me having a bicycle.  Alan grabbed some package that was sitting on a concrete wall (I hate concrete walls... if you can't afford a stone one, then don't bother cause it looks really lame).  He opened it and I grabbed what was inside in my curiosity.  It was a video game for PS2.  Shit, what the fuck was the game...?  I can't recall right now.  But my brother wanted to see it, so I put it behind my back and opened the case to show him the insert, and as I did that, the black man stole the game cartridge (yes it was a cartridge, but in my dream it was for the PS2, go figure on that one...).  I threw away the case, knowing I no longer had any leverage left, and was about to fling myself it a fit of rage at the black man when Alan stepped in.  I woke up just at that point.  

I am really starting to wonder why I am dreaming of people I know so much.  I never dream of people I know.  Too many things are going on these days that just don't fit with how I know myself to be.  I don't drink every night.  I don't sleep all day.  I don't do erratic things like I have been lately.  And I sure as shit don't just stop eating.  I eat maybe once a day, if I am really pushing myself.  I went almost three days without eating for a while there.  That's not like me.  I used to eat at least three times a day.  And nibble almost incessantly.  Food rules!  So why isn't it doing much for me anymore.  Like last night, I made myself go eat something because I knew I had to.  My body needs food whether it wants it or not.  I didn't really savor my food like I usually do.  It was so mechanical it was bothering me.  Hand to plate, grab food, hand to mouth....  so very mechanical.  I haven't bothered to pluck my eyebrows in over a week.  I haven't bothered to repaint my nails or file them.  I haven't had a bath in almost two weeks.  I used to have one at least once a week.  

I dunno... I'll figure it out eventually.  Till then, I'm going to keep drinking and keep sleeping in and hopefully if I keep eating little I'll actually lose the weight I gained back in the fall...."

"event","Well today wasn't a very good day.  I woke up feeling okay, and I thought it would be a good day, but I was wrong.  I got called into work to cover phones because the phone lady had to go to a doctor's appointment, and the phone lady that was coming on after her was sick.  So I basically get in the door and walk right out again.  No shower, no time to change clothes.  But oh, do you have time to stop at Murchies and grab this for so-and-so?  Hmmmm... thanks.  No really, I don't fucking mind at all you numbnuts sons of bitches.  All I grabbed was an iced tea while I was there.  It was good, actually, but that doesn't really fit in with my rant.  So I get to work and the phones are non-stop.  I am overwhelmed with having to do phones when three of four lines are ringing most of the time, and I also have to do the laundry because apparently no one around there knows how to operate a washer or a drier, or how to even fold the shit, for God's sake.  And I'm also cleaning rooms because everyone is sneaking off without doing their fucking chores.  To top it all off... we're right near where they're renovating a building for a new outdoor clothing store, right?  So there's constuction workers doing their thing.  How they found out is beyond me, but they know what kind of business we have, but they usually leave us alone and don't say anything.  Not this morning/afternoon.  I got jeered as I was walking in and I was so fucking frustrated I cried.  It was either that or march back out there and bitch-slap the fuckers to kingdom-come.  Not a good start to my supposedly good day.  

So I have had a really stressful day, and I am really depressed and I went out to Evo for a bit, but it wasn't doin' it for me.  I wasn't in the mindset to be there.  Which is weird, since I'm always down for Evo.  I dunno... Just a rough day overall.  I stayed long enough to have a couple beer, then I went to Paul's for something to eat, since I was famished.  Grilled cheese and onion rings... comfort food... mmmmmmm.  And a hot cocoa with whipped cream.  Hells yes.  I just got back to the hostel now and I am totally restless.  Thank God open mic night is done, otherwise I'd probably go nuts and shoot someone.  With what, I don't know, but I'm sure that in my rage I could figure something out.

I also called my ex-fiancee Mark a few days ago.  He didn't sound particularly happy to hear from me.  He sounded really sad and forlorn.  He said that ""it still hurts"".  Okey-dokey.  I was just calling because I had been thinking of him lately, and usually when I think of someone for a while out of the blue its for a reason.  I think I might see if he wants to catch a film or something on the weekend.  I don't care.  I really don't care who's good for me or not anymore.  It really doesn't matter.  You can't shelter yourself from life.  It's going to kick the door in if you try.  Or so my experience with life has been.   

On the bright side, I spent the day painting wooden boxes to give as Imbolg presents.  I don't know who exactly I'm going to give them to, but I think they're pretty.  Probably going to give one to Jared, Lorna, one of the girls from work, and I don't know what to do with the rest.  I want to give them to people who actually appreciate that I took the time to paint them and to give the boxes to them.  That doesn't leave that many people.  

Well, I think I'm going to have a hot shower and do some reading.  I have to go check out some Marquis de Sade (not sure if that's spelled quite right).  I heard good things about him from Daniel, so I think I'm going to search Chapter's for one of his books.  

Today was a shitty day that was coming for a while.  Tomorrow the sun will shine and I will be in a much better mood.  I damned well better be, anyhow.  I'm going to go out to Evo again tomorrow night, too.  Free pizza!!  And maybe the company will cheer me up."

"event","I don't feel my normal self these days.  Still.  It's been going on for over a week, and I'm wondering if maybe depression has snuck up on me.  I haven't had a real bout of depression in over a year, but I think I might be in the grasp of one these days.  I just don't feel motivated about much of anything right now, and I feel like I'm going through an identity crisis.  

I've been going out to Evo lots, just to get out and do something somewhere other than in my room.  Pretty lame, I know.  Alan, the doorman was talking to me about weird shit on Sunday.  He came to my table and started a conversation that led to him asking me why I wore black contacts - did I think they made me look scary?  Why did I behave the way I do?  Why this, why that.  Questioning me in every way from every angle.  It really stuck with me.  Why do I do the things I do?  Everyone knows I'm different inside and outside of the bar.  At Evo I get more rambunctious and loud-mouthed and agressive.  I let myself say stupid things and crack jokes I wouldn't really crack in my ""normal"" life.  The Michelle outside of Evo is quiet and uptight and never really says anything all that funny.  She's introverted and socially anxious and shy.  So why do I behave so differently from one extreme to the other?  Who am I underneath it all?  I really don't know.  It sounds preposterous to have someone my age saying she doesn't know who she is, but that's exactly how I feel.  I don't know why I do alot of the things I do, and I am growing more and more uncertain of anything, really.  

It's like I'm completely lost in life right now.  Do I stay in Victoria?  Do I stay in Canada?  Do I travel the world and be alone while doing it?  What the hell am I going to do?  What's the right choice?  I'm not comfortable being sweet and shy and quiet like I am naturally inclined to be.  But I can't keep hopping back and forth between two extremes.  It's not good for my health - mentally or spiritually.  I doubt anyone could really grasp what I feel right now.  I have no official home.  I have no official job.  I have no official ties to anyplace.  It's like drifting on the open sea after being used to having a tether.  It's overwhelming, scary, alarming, exciting and nerve-wracking all at once.  It's completely bizarre.  

So I don't know what the hell to do about all this.  I am not really happy anymore, but that could just be the depression talking.  All I want to do is drink and sleep, and that's not good.  Not good at all.  I find myself doing things impulsively and without reason.  Nothing serious, but still... its not like me to just up and do something I wouldn't normally do.  It's sure as shit not like me to go get drunk every night.  Nor is it like me to be as agressive as I have been lately.  I'm not sure what the fuck is going on.  Maybe I'm going crazy.  Maybe I'm having some kind of breakdown.  **sigh**  I don't know.  That's the bitch of it all: I just don't know.  I'm being stupid and I know I am, but I can't seem to stop myself from being like this.  

So tonight will be - what? - I think day five of my bender.   Maybe I'll have some kind of epiphone after all this drinking.  I sure as hell hope I do, cause I need some guidance from the greater source.  Thank you to Jared who has been there for me through this in his own little ways.  And thank you to everyone else for putting up with me being a total dumbass lately.  Maybe one day soon I'll manage to figure myself out."

"event","I've been in one of my trademark weird moods for about a week or so now.  It's really starting to get to me.  

For those who don't know.  Al and I are done.  I asked him for some reassurance on something and he writes back criticizing me, then has the gaul to tell me not to e-mail or call him since he'll be taking a 2 week break.  He said ""I won't pick up even if I am home"".  Nice.  So I wrote him and told him that his little break will be extended indefinately.  I love him dearly and all that, but when it comes time to basic needs and common courtesy in a relationship, I put my foot down.  He's not meeting my needs, and he's not really even trying.  So that's part of the reason Michelle has been acting strange lately.  

If only I knew the other reason(s).  Work has been odd lately.  I either get hardly anything all week, or I get two or three a day.  I wish it was consitent, but the very nature of the biz is far from consistent.  My photos are up now, I think.  I have no clue how they look, or which ones he put up.  I don't really care about that shit anymore.  

I think its safe to say I'm depressed.  I've got all the symptoms: not caring about shit anymore like I used to, being noteably more sluggish than usual in the morning, drinking more, eating less.  Not good.  At least today is a nice sunny day.  And its my day off.  I'm working anyhow, but I think I will be on call so I can go to the park and beat up a tree or something.  Feed the squirrels.  That will make me think of Al, but I don't care.  He's obviously wanting this to end since he's not helping it to work at all.  Maybe I'll beat up a squirrel and mail him the carcass.  No.  I couldn't do that to an animal.  

Been having very odd dreams lately, as well.  I often dream of flying or being able to jump so high its practically flying.  Even having special powers and shit.  But I haven't had any of those dreams lately.  I haven't seen my whales or my horses in so long, either.  In my dream life (I think of it as a whole different life) I have an affinity with whales and horses - but mostly whales.  I can be on the beach or in a boat, and I can call them to me and I dive into the ocean without fear and swim with my bohemoth friends.  Horses I usually seem to dream of only in the transportation sense.  They give me rides places when I need it.  But I've had none of those dreams for a while now.  Instead I dream of weird things.  

Last night I dreampt I was on the BC Ferries, which is a somewhat recurring dream for me.  The ferry left Vancouver and was going really really slow.  It was late at night, and the sky was dark.  There was some kind of forensics/investigations team on the ferry.  They had a head office there and I remember calling them to get some information about volunteering.  Alan, the door man from Evo was on the ferry, too.  I've been dreaming of him alot lately.  I never dream of people I actually know.  Al, my man was also on the ferry.  If only my brother Allan was on there, that would make the three Al's in my life!!  The ferry was sort of sinking.  I was on the top deck, and it was mostly underwater.  People were swimming after the ferry looking for a hand-hold, and a few smart ones were clinging to the side of the ferry, holding themselves above water.  Al and myself were two of the smart ones.  He was across from me, and I waited for a wave to pass - slamming my face underwater as it went - and carefully swam over to Al.  I grabbed him and dragged him towards the main part of the ferry.  For reasons unknown the ferry began to slowly rise again, just like it sinking with no reason or warning.  People were agitated and grumpy, soaked to the bone with cold seawater.  I ended up losing track of Al - my Al - but saw Alan from Evo for a brief bit.  I can't remember what he said to me, but it was something.  Again, for reasons unknown to me, I was walking down a road with some people and I had to go and find something.  Sorry I'm not being more descriptive... It comes to me as I go through it.  It was a road and there was a bull that was always trying to break out of its pen.  It was a big black angus steer that looked about 1300lbs.  The people I was with, who I think was one of my brothers - Mike, the asshole brother - killed a goat and put part of it into some little vial.  I have no idea why, but oh well.  I felt the strong feeling that this was wrong somehow, and I ended up stealing the vial from my brother and hopping into a car I flagged down on the road.  Mike was clinging to the back of the car for a while, but we lost him.  I ended up back on the road, walking, and I ran into Alan again.  I got him to walk me to the forensic/investigation people on the ferry again.  I don't really remember much else.  It was very strange.

I dreampt of Alan (from Evo) a few nights ago, and he said that ""he liked me better before"".  I don't know what that's supposed to mean, but it was weird.  Why have I been dreaming about people in my life so often lately?  I never dream of people in my life, always strangers that my mind makes up.  Oh well... 

Other than that, I've been okay.  I should get going for the day before daylight wears thin."

"event","Never drink with the Irish!!  Unless you can really handle your liquor, that is.  Me and Tara met up and went out with a buddy from the hostel last night.  We started off at Big Bad John's.  Then we went to Irish Times.  Oh my fucking God, that place is awful!  The people there are snobby and stuck up and totally existential.  Not my crowd at all.  We ended up meeting a couple of guys there and the four of us went to Evo.  By this point I was pretty close to being drunk and Tara was well on her way.  I met up with a chick I know at Evo and we ended up doing shots of each other's nipples.  **sigh**  Tara couldn't stop fumbling and tripping and she ended up getting kicked out just as the bar was closing anyways.  My God, I am never letting anyone take me out like that again!  And next time she and I go out, I am making sure she doesn't drink that much again.  Yes, you're Irish, but still... it's a little thing called self-control.  She needs a lesson or two on that subject.  

So I walked her back to her hotel, and declined her offer to spend the night.  I had to work in the morning and decided it would be a bad idea since I'd likely sleep in if I spent the night at her place.  

I ended up sleeping in until after 1 and to my surprise, I wasn't hungover in the least!  I wasn't totally wasted last night, but I was expecting some kind of reprimand the next morning.  Nope.  I was fine.  Peachy-keen.  

Work's still been kinda slow, but oh well.  Life goes on.  A buddy of mine that drive me up to Ucluelet last weekend is coming back to town for a bit later in the week.  That should be cool.  We're thinking of renting another car and doing some more driving.  YAY!  I love road trips.  

So that's me up to date.  I'm letting the Al thing lie, and I'm going to see what he chooses to do about this issue.  I told him that he can call me anytime, so I'll see if he does.  But I can tell ya this much: if he tells me to call him at a certain time on a certain day and he's not there again, I'm gonna let him have it!  I can't keep doing this with him.  Yes, he's busy.  But so am I.  If I can make time, so can he.  End of story.  

Hope everyone is doing well, and I will update when something exciting happens."

"event","Okay, warning: this is a rant.  You've been warned.

Al and I have been great.  No complaints on that count.  But because of our schedules and the whopping 19 hour time difference, we haven't really spoken for any length of time on the phone in well over a week.  Its getting on my nerves.  He says he'll write with a time he'll be home but then he's not there when I call.  And I wrote him an e-mail telling him how difficult this is becoming on me.  I could handle not seeing him, as long as we got in a good phone conversation at least once a week.  That's not much to ask.  I fail to see what's so hard about picking a day when he'll have a couple hours to do nothing and set it aside to talk to me.  I get an e-mail back from him criticizing me and saying that its ""always the woman"" that is to blame for long distance relationships not working.  He said that he was sorry he was so busy, and he apologized for not being there to call when he said he would be because he likes to go out for walks and doesn't like to spend alot of time at home.  I made sure to carefully word my e-mail so it was neither whiny or bitchy, but still got the message across that I was feeling like I needed some reassurance, and more than anything, I needed to have a conversation with him that spanned more than 10 minutes.  I wasn't happy with his reply.  He told me to call today since he'd be home, and - BIG SHOCK - he wasn't around.  I left a message and told him that he could call me anytime at OI.  I don't want to be a bitch, but I have to put my foot down.  He knows how to use a phone, so why should I be the one to chase him around?  I am finding myself more and more wanting to cheat on him.  I feel horrible even admitting to myself, let alone everyone reading this, that I am actually feeling/thinking that way, but its true.  How can I be expected to stay faithful to someone that I never get to see and very rarely get to talk to?  Anyone would want something a little more tangible than that.  I don't want to break up with him, I just want to find some kind of agreement, like how we dealt with the last issue.  I want him to pick a regular time on a set day where he will be home for sure when I can call him.  How hard could that possibly be?  A couple hours a week on a set time and day...  That's not unreasonable.  But I'm starting to think that if going for a walk is more important than setting time aside to talk to me, then what the hell?  Maybe there's something going on that I don't know about that makes him not want to be at home much.  He mentioned there was some stress in the homestead, but wouldn't get into details.  Maybe he's just feeling the pressure of working a shit kitchen job and trying to finish his pHd all at once.  I don't know.  I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt, but I want to talk to him about this and see if he will set aside a set time and actually stick to it.  

I've got more to write about my night last night... went out with an Irish buddy.  Oh God, what a night that was!!  I've got to go to work, but I'll write about that when I get back."

"event","I wonder what ever happened to that ""anonymous"" person who always wrote rude posts on my LJ.  Guess they found something more productive to do.  Good.  

I've noticed that there hasn't been as much stress and negativity in my life as I'm used to over the past few weeks.  My existence is pretty low-key.  I wake up, go to work, chat with the girls, go for a walk, go back to the hostel, have a beer or two at the bar and go to bed.  Maybe go out on a weekend or something.  Call the odd person now and then.  Pretty stress free.  I like it.  I guess once you make up your mind to have a no tolerance policy for shit, shit goes elsewhere.  Like today, I woke up and went to the police station for my interview.  I saw a rainbow first thing.  The first glimpse of the world for the day was a rainbow.  How nice is that?  I'm so much happier these days, now that I've made up my mind that I want happiness and I won't settle for less.  The power of the mind man... some freaky shit.  I don't have monumentally great things happen to me, but I have small things that I notice that put a smile on my face for hours.  Its those things that I lost touch with at some earlier point in my life, and its so nice to be reconnected.  The world is a shitty place, but a beautiful place.  And its only shitty if you let the shit build up on your proverbial doorstep.  Positive thinking and all that, its hard to do, and it sounds like something a mescaline-tripping hippie would talk about, but my God, there's really something to it!!  After reading my friend Daniel's latest LJ post about wanting to get reconnected to his spirituality and his magick, I think I might do the same.  I am done walking around with my eyes closed and my ears deafened.  I want to pay attention again, I want to ride the cycles and let the wind blow me.  I'm happy for myself.  There's nothing arrogant or prideful in it.  I'm happy for myself in the same way I would be happy for someone else's achievement.  I am really excited about where I am taking my life and all the great adventures I will have and all the wonderous things I will see.  Amazing what a simple change in thought can do for a person...."

"event","Well I have discovered something interesting.  I get bored in one place these days.  Its not that I don't love Victoria, and its not that I have some weird kind of ADD.  I guess I really enjoyed hopping from one city to the next, and now I really have a taste for it.  I've decided to try to work out east for a while before I officially leave the country.  I'm probably going to stay in the Victoria area until I get my visa, then travel around to Saskatoon, Toronto, and Halifax.  Weird choices, I know.  But I have family in Saskatoon, and friends in Toronto and Ottawa, and there's some good money to be made in Halifax from what I gather from a co-worker.  

The phone lady who works days at the agency used to work in Halifax, and she says a girl like me would make a total killing out there.  So that's what my new plan is.  Man, I change my mind alot, don't I??  Oh well, that's the fun of life - freedom.  Why not see some more of my own country before I take off?  That way when people ask me what its like in Canada I can give them a half decent answer.  Daniel is going to be happy that I will be able to come visit him for a bit before I leave.  And I can go check out that sweet-ass goth/vicotrian store Siren.  I have last year's catalogue and the stuff in there is great!!  We're talking like the old school frilly Victorian shirts and gowns and skirts.  They've even got old school leather boots with the flat sole that they wore back in the day!!  I know I'm going to need alot of $$ before I go there cause I'll want to buy everything!!

Well, nothing really new lately.  Been kinda broke cause last week was slow for me and then I had to take four days off cause of my monthlies.  Oh well... can't complain.  Life's overall quite satisfying these days.  Al and I have managed to connect twice lately, for a whopping fifteen minutes or so.  I told him to let me know when he'd be around so we could have a real conversation on the phone, without one of us having to run off to work or something.  He went to the Mudvayne show and had a blast from what I gather.  But the poor bloke hadn't been drinking much since he's been in Aus and he was in the mosh pit for the whole show, and then had a few too many afterwards.  Needless to say he was really sore and really sick.  And he had to go to work in a hot kitchen all day, too!!  Oh the humanity!

Today I woke up to go talk to a police officer.  You have to do an interview with them as the final stage of your licensing, right?  So I crawl out of bed (day off) and walk outside to go to the cop shop.  Right at the very moment I walk out the door someone points out a rainbow in the distance.  What a wonderful omen!!  The interview went well and she seemed a very nice woman.  And Justin managed to score me a copy of The Legend Of Zelda for NES!!  And he's going to look for some N64 games for me, too, since my brother is giving me his old one.  Oh!  I am so happy I could burst!!  Good things coming my way, I can feel it.  And I just got my new photos for work put up, and I haear they're good, but I can't view them for some reason.  Oh well....  Hopefully it will perk up business.  I'm probably going to hop over to Vancouver for a working trip sometime soon, too.  Need the extra cash.  I can make a week's wage in two days in Van.  Why the hell not?  

Alone for Valentine's Day.  But not really.  Just apart.  I don't know if I'm going to do anything.  I think I might finally burn that log Al sent me and make into some kind of ritual.  He's going to be mad that I haven't burnt it yet.  I would be, too.  It's incriminating evidence!  It's his ass that could end up with a hefty fine and passport revoked!  Well, I hope everyone is as good as I am today.  

Oh, I forgot... Tara, one of the Irish girls I met in the fall, she's in town for a couple days!  I have to meet up with her for a beer.  That should be fun!  I love the travelling lifestyle... the only downside is that all your friends are spread out all over the globe.  Oh well... I can think of worse things.  Cheers..."

"event","Okay, so last night I was chilling in the lounge and I ended up talking to a few really cool guys.  They were quite intelligent and were all discussing all kinds of things ranging from politics to religion to history to all other things.  Great conversation.  Few hours pass and we're all chatting away.  Then end of the night draws near.  I wanted to go to Evo.  I went out and one of them came with me.  He didn't realize he needed two pieces of ID and only brought his passport.  He couldn't get it, so we went out to QV's instead.  We got back to the hostel around 3 or so and headed to bed.  Before we had left, one of the other guys at the table said he was renting a car to drive up to Tofino, and we were welcome to join him.  So we agreed to meet in the hostel lobby at 8:30 the next morning.  That didn't leave much time for sleep.  That's fine... I'm getting used to not sleeping much.  So we met up and went out for breakfast to Floyd's.  Then we got the car.  Well... minivan, actually.  Off we went.  Talking about all kinds of shit the whole time.  It took us 10 hours round trip.  

We stopped along the Malahat so Dave (driver) could get a few shots of the great view.  Then we stopped again in Nanaimo to take a piss and all that good shit.  We turned off at Qualicum and headed down the highway towards Port Renfrew.  Along that stretch of highway we passed Cathedral Grove, which for those who don't know, contains some of the oldest trees on the island.  They're beautiful trees and its such a spiritual place.  You can't help but to be in awe of nature when you're there.  We toured around there for a while and got some photos of us hugging and standing in the hollow trunks of there mammoth trees.  We stopped again at Port Renfrew and got some munchies and shit again.  I asked if we needed gas and Dave said we were good.  Okay, set to go then.  The road between Renfrew and Ucluelet was fucking incredible.  Pretty much the whole time we were driving on the road alongside this gorgeous river and all this wonderful scenery of misty mountains rising from the water, and marshes and huge boulders carved by waters of a time past standing in the middle of a now shallow river.  It was so amazing.  I wish I could do that trip again so I could get photos.  It was that incredible.  I recommend the trip to everyone and anyone.  

So about halfway to Ucluelet, Dave notes that the gas tank is on a quarter tank.  Just under, in fact.  So we all start getting tense.  Dave feels like a knob for checking the wrong guage (he looked at oil instead of gas when I asked him).  He kept saying that if we break down, he'll walk.  We were like, no, we all walk or we all solve it together.  That's the way it works.  So we're driving all slow to conserve fuel (its doesn't really conserve all that much, but I didn't want to make things worse by critiquing) and trying to joke and shit while we can tell Dave's feeling like a horse's ass.  Embarassment and guilt.  Shitty combination.  So we barely make it to Ucluelet and we all had a good chuckle about it (of course).  By this time it was around five or so and it was fully dark.  We decided that we'd seen alot for today and had enough adventure, and besides, we wouldn't be able to see shit all anyways.  So we turned back towards Nanaimo.

We were talking away the whole time.  These guys are so knowledgeable on politics, history, and all kinds of other such things.  I just sat and listened for the most part.  I can learn more if I listen and only talk when I need a point clarified.  It was wonderful.  I love the hostel.  Where else would that happen?  A random person invites you on a road trip?  Good deal.

I got back to see my brother Allan was trying to reach me all day.  I was kind of worried because as a general rule, when people call you every couple hours, its either because someone's in the hospital, or they've got some kind of emergency.  Turns out he just found a place that has a tv for a really good price.  And he's going to give me his old N64!!!   I love my brother!!  I have had such a great day today, I can't believe it.  I almost want to go buy a lottery ticket, you know?  

Al, my man, went to see Mudvayne in Brisbane today.  I want to know how the show was.  He's seen them before many times, but I still want to hear about it.  He'll want to talk about it, so it works out well.  I hope I can reach him tomorrow.  He said he'd be around, but I don't know what time.  

I'm off work for a couple days cause of my monthly cycle.  Good thing, too or I wouldn't have been able to do the road trip that I did today.  Hope everyone's well...."

"event","So I switched my schedule at work so I am now working the later shift.  That way I am at work until anywhere from midnight until 6 in the morning.  So when I get back to the hostel, I can actually go to sleep.  I stay in bed until after dark and do it all again.  I love it!!  No more sunlight for this girl!  

Went out to Evo last night.  What a weird night it was...  Going out again tonight, was hoping there'd be someone of interest out.  I haven't seen people in a while and they never seem to come out on the nights that I do.  Maybe you're all avoiding me....   :-(

Al got a job.  Fucking took the guy long enough!  Really...  He's been back for almost two months and he just now got a job!?!?  Meh, I don't really care that much.  But it sucks because he says he has no time for me to call him anymore.  I understand he's working, but can't I reach him in the mornings before he goes to work?  Lucky bastard is off to see Mudvayne on Sunday.  I think that's today for him.  I'm really envious of that.  I would love to see them play live.  And he's already seen them like three times!  He says I won't be able to get ahold of him until around Monday, my time.  Grrrr...  I hate waiting so long to talk to him.  I've had so much going on over the past week, and I haven't been able to talk to him about it all.  I don't like putting everything in e-mails because then when we talk, we have nothing much to talk about.  And besides, I prefer for people to actually hear the tone of my voice and shit like that.  E-mails are so monotonous.  We're still doing great, Al and I.  We haven't bickered or even said anything remotely grumpy to each other since we worked it out.  I am so happy about that.  He's got to go back to Townsville soon to finish the last of his pHd, and to get the $$ owed to him by the university.  So he'll be out of communication for a couple weeks there.  Unless he actually gives me a contact #.  We'll see.  I've been pretty busy myself lately.  So I don't think two weeks would drag by too slowly.  We'll see how it goes.  

Anyhow, I'm gonna have a round of cards with some folks here and then go get some breakfast.  I love this new schedule!  I never have to see the sun!  Yay!"

"event","Okay, I know I work with alot of women and there's bound to be drama, but this is really getting to a shockingly appalling level for me.  There's two phone ladies that seem to have it in for each other.  They're always bad mouthing the other one and all this shit.  Today when one was leaving and the other one was coming on, I left to go get something to eat.  When I got back about ten minutes later they were still chit chatting and they had exchanged numbers!  So if you hate each other so much, then what was that?  I'm getting really tired of all the drama and shit going on around the workplace.  I could just not work in house, but if I do that, I won't make as much money because you always make more if you're in house.  Grrrr....  I dunno... I think I am going to get a library card (hopefully I won't still be on the books [pardon the pun] for stealing a couple books from them) and I can chill out in the other room and read a book and watch tv rather than sit and get involved in the drama.  And for those who think its easy to not get involved, try sitting in a room listening to it for hours on end.  So I'm just going to sit in the other room.  I'm fed up.  I love the girls and everyone there, I'm just getting very very bored with the same dramas playing all the time.  

And I have to get a tv later this week.  Well... I don't HAVE to, but it will give me something to do with my time at night so I'm not tempted to eat out of boredom or go out to the bar and spend money out of boredom.  Actually, investing a few hundred in a console and a tv is saving me three times that for all the money I'd spend going out to eat and drink beers and shit.  I think I'll do that on Saturday sometime.  

Finally got photos done today.  The photographer dropped by to do a new girl's photos (which is odd since I've been trying to get ahold of him for over a month now) and I conned him into doing some quick ones of me.  I still want Justin to do some for me because these ones were rushed, and I don't know if they will be to my liking.  Probably not.  So Justin, I still want some done at some point.  Not so big of a rush now, though.  And Jared, I still haven't heard back from you about my dress...!!  My new toy rules!  Its so soft and pliable and mmmmmmmm good!  

So I had two days off in a row earlier this week, right?  Ever since then I haven't been my usual chipper self.  I think I'm in need of a vacation.  But I can't take one until I get my $4000.  Dammit!!  I wish I could gamble well.  I think next week or maybe the week after, I am going to go to the casino and see what I can do with $50.  If I double it, I put half away and start back at $50.  If I lose more than half, quit.  If I make $400 profit, go home and call it a night before I get greedy.  If I find I'm decent at it, I'll make a weekly thing of it.  Cause if I can make an extra few hundred a week, even at the casino, then I'll do it.  I want to go yesterday.  I am so sick of all the shit and drama.  I am really considering going to Saskatchewan to work for the rest of my time in Canada.  The biz out there is not too bad, and from what I gather, they could use decent girls who offer a girlfriend experience for a decent rate.  We'll see.  If work doesn't pick up over the next couple weeks, I'm going to leave.  I have to start making about $700-$1000 a week.  Or I won't get to Aus until my birthday.  And I can't have that!  I'd go nuts and have a mental breakdown or something.  Work's been slower this week for me than it has been lately.  I didn't get anything today, and what money I made throughout the week I spent on lingere and shit.  Now I have more than enough lingere for work, so I can stop spending money on that kind of stuff.  But now I am kinda used to going shopping.  It sucks.  

I have to knuckle down now.  I've invested money in my work, now I have to invest it in my bank account.  I paid off $200 on my VISA a while back, and I am hoping to put another $300-$500 on it this week, and hopefully pay it right off.  Then I won't have to worry about that.  No more little shopping sprees, no more going out for dinner all the time.  I've got to start eating better and being more conscious of what I actually need to spend money on and what I don't.  If it keeps me sane, okay.  If it brings in more biz, okay.  If it gets me to Aus faster, okay.  Other than that, no deal.  I'm going to get some of those little Ziploc container dealies and bring veggies and fruit to work to munch on rather than going to Chinatown and getting bbq pork on rice.  I've been good with not eating alot of junk food, other than the bbq pork, and I drink alot of V8 and water.  Just need more whole foods in me.  

Is it me or has this year been of to a weird start?  I've been stressed out almost non-stop since just after Christmas.  I should give quitting smoking another go, too, I think.  I did it and the only reason I started again was because everyone at work said I was crankier and bitchier since I quit.  So I started again.  Maybe I should go on the patch this time so I can at least get some nicotine into my system.  I dunno....  I need more dental floss, too.  Its been over a month since I've properly flossed, and I feel all icky in the mouth because of it.  I want to get one of those fancy-schmancy water jet flosser thingies...  They look really cool.  Depends on cost, though.  I need a new toothbrush, too.  Three cheers for hygene!!  Hip-hip hooray!  Hip-hip hooray!  Hip-hip hooray!!  Yeah, I'm a weirdo, I know it."

"event","So I talked to my dad about the wedding and all this and he mentioned the health of Bev's parent's wasn't so good these days, hence why they planned it for when they did rather than waiting another year as originally planned.  So I wrote Bev to congradulate her and all this.  I mentioned my man might come, but probably not since he'd be flying across the globe for a couple weeks.  The usual hope you're doing wells and shit like that.  I got a reply from her that I just checked today.  She wrote me a short e-mail that said for one, her parent's health wasn't meant to be told to anyone, she only told my dad to prepare him for the fact that she'd have stressful days as a result of the issue.  Okay, but why are you giving me shit for it?  I didn't ask, my dad told me.  And she said that the wedding would be only family, no friends, no boyfriends or girlfriends of family... stictly family.  She said something else which struck me as rude, but I can't recall.  So I wrote her back saying that I understand, but I will pass on the wedding.  I told her I'm not flying all the way across the world again and not be able to bring my man to meet my family.  And I told her that I wanted to express my concern for her parent's and that I was sorry I did.  I said I won't do it next time.  No signature, nothing.  She can go to hell for all I care.  I didn't need some condescending e-mail from her just because she's having a pissy day.  I love my dad, but I won't put up with that bullshit from her (or anyone).  Just because she pulled that shit, I'm not going to the wedding.  So I won't be back in this part of the world for several years.  Fucking stepmothers!  What is her problem!  I don't get it.  **sigh**  oh well.... I'm going to go have a smoke..."

"event","I was looking forward to getting my photos done by Justin tonight, but alas, he can't find his camera's charger.  So no photos for me.  Oh well... it gives me a little extra time to shed a few pounds before the shoot.  I got a new vibrator today!  I'm happy.  Its really nice, and its made of some kind of rubbery stuff that's firm but quite soft.  Ahhh... they joys of toys!  Well I guess I will have to wait to model my new lingere, too.  Time to start sticking to the healty eating regime I planned on.  No more colas, no more crap food, and more veggies and water!  And I am going to try and exercise more.  If I don't go for a walk or something I'll try to do some yoga or something while I'm sitting around at work.  At least it's something.  

Al sent me another e-mail today.  I'm so happy that we're back to normal.  I get stressed out over relationships too easily and it really wears on me.  He wrote about going to see King Kong, and how it wasn't all he thought it would be.  Well, duh!  He says that he needs to get kidnapped so he'll have something interesting to write about!  And for some unknown reason he finished the e-mail with ""wakey wakey hands off the snakey"".  What a strange, funny man!  

Nothing of note, really.  Same shit different day.  I went out to Evo on Monday to meet up with Justin, and I swear to God, half the hostel showed up!  It was actually really cool to party with some of them.  I made a fool of myself as always, but I don't care.  Everyone knows me to some extent, and I think people kind of half expect me to dance like a retard.  Oh!! Shit, I almost forgot!  I found a card in the woman's washroom.  It said ""I'm trying to get my friend laid.  His name's Nathan and he's mildly retarded.  Blah blah blah.  Phone number"".  Fuck I got a kick out of that.  Why would you advertise that someone is ""mildly retarded""??  I showed it to everyone and they had a chuckle over it, too.  It was actually a great night.  I didn't wake up still half drunk this morning, either.  That was nice.  When I got back to the hostel, I went straight to bed, but tossed and turned for a while because I had a spell of lonliness.  Now I know why people call their exes when they're all drunk at three in the morning.  For some reason you get lonely, and you miss your man or woman.  I wanted nothing more than to cuddle up with Al, but I couldn't.  So I settled for cuddling with the pillow.  It was a decent fill-in.  Prolly gonna go out Thurs night.  Free pizza!  I'm in!  

So I got my hair cut today, eh?  I go see Mischa at Arq downtown.  Love her!  She hardly took any length off, just neatened up the ends and redid the layers a bit.  She stopped and sorta looked at me and said ""did you know your hair is naturally wavy?"".  I was like ""....ummmm....no...."".  She put a little bit of product in it and presto, Michelle has flowing loose curls!!  I was so impressed I almost shat myself.  She blew me away.  I got it done at about 2 this afternoon, and now, five hours later, the curl is still holding!  No curling iron or anything.  I told her right off the bat that my hair refused to hold a curl, but she defied it - and me!  I am so happy about that.  I actually can style my hair the way I've always dreampt of: those flowy loose, wavy curls...  ah, bliss!  So I grabbed a thing of the products she used (spray gel and some kind of creme styler), tipped her and strutted on out of there like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever.   I brought her the usual boquet of flowers and chocolates, of course.  I always bring at least a small boquet for my hair dressers.  They appreciate it.  If they do a good job, I'll also tip, if not, then they have flowers at the least.  I'm going to go back later this week and pick up some shampoo and conditioner.  I didn't know they had their own line of hair products.  The shampoo and conditioner I've got now is a drug store brand (fructus) and after using salon stuff for several bottles, I really notice a huge difference in going back to a cheaper brand.  
I need to get a decent hair dryer and a diffuser and a straightening iron, too.  Now that someone has taken the time to show me how to style my hair, I'm stoked on it!  Can you tell?  Ha ha ha!  Okay enough about my hair...

Well, I hope everyone's doing well, and I will update in a couple days."

"event","So I got a phone call from my brother Allan today.  He's my favorite bro, for those who don't know.  He just finished getting his journeyman in carpentry, but now that he's out of school, he's still working like 6 days a week.  Poor kid never has any free time!  I was really happy he rang me.  We met up for lunch and had a good chat with each other.  He's wanting to get out of Victoria now that he's done school.  With his ticket, he can go anywhere to do carpentry and get a wicked good pay out of it, too.  He's getting $25/hr right now.  Not too bad for someone 23 years old.  Owns his own truck and everything.  I always knew out of the three of us kids, he'd do the best.  He's got the right combination of motivation, self-discipline, and determination to really go somewhere in life.  I love him to bits.  

He also told me that my father is going to get married to his long-time sweetheart, Bev.  I am so happy for them!  My dad deserves a lovely woman like her.  They are so good together, too!  But the thing is that the wedding is the long weekend in August, and I will be in Aus by that point, and I don't know if I can afford the $1000 for a ticket back.  I have to talk to Al about it and see what he thinks.  I would like him to come, too.  I want him to meet my family so bad, and this is the perfect chance!  The wedding will be in Vancouver, but the reception will be back east in Saskatoon.  I really want to go partly because its my dad's wedding and I want to be there for his big day (he'll want his little girl there, I'm sure) and I also want to go because I can visit with some family that I haven't seen in a dog's age.  We'll see.  I'll find a way to go either way, but I would really like Al to come along, too.  He's got enough airpoints for a ticket back to North America, but I don't know if he'll want to come to my father's wedding.  

So I am going to invest in a small tv and a second hand PS2 or something.  I need something to occupy myself on those days where I don't feel like getting out of bed but am bored senseless... and for those nights when I just can't sleep to save my life.  I can get a cheap tv for under a hundred and a PS2 for about a hundred.  It will save my sanity.  And I want to see if I can get an original Nintendo, too.  I technically own the Legend Of Zelda game at Jared's so if I got my own Nintendo, I'm sure he'd let me have it.  He never plays that one, anyways.  He likes the Adventures of Link better.  

I am so excited about getting photos done!!  I got another new outfit, so I'll have like three or four nice outfits to wear!  I set up an appointment to get my hair done on Tuesday, too, so I'll that hot, fresh-from-the-salon look!  I haven't been back to Arq since last year, so it will be good to go back there again.  I really liked Micha, who did my hair last time.  I am debating whether or not I want to bother with colour.  I like the colour it is right now because its pretty much exactly my natural colour, so I don't have to worry about roots.  But I want something more sassy.  I guess a good cut is worth more than a good colour.  And its cheaper by over $100.  

Had a good long conversation with Al last night.  I called him cause I was so bored and I couldn't sleep.  We shot the shit for a couple hours, cracking jokes and making each other laugh.  He was on the computer doing his schoolwork (structural geology) when I called.  I got him to talk like a scientist for me.  God, that's so hot when he does that!  I love intelligence more than anything else in a man.  Just so happens I got a great package deal with Al: looks, brains, braun, and a good demeanor.  It was so nice to have a two hour jokefest with him!  We both needed it.  He's stressed out with schoolwork and I'm just stressed.  

Well nothing new to write, really.  Got today and tomorrow off work.  Woot!!  I needed some time off.  Yesterday was rough.  I wasn't exactly up to my normal self.  Lack of sleep and waking up still half drunk will do that to a girl, though.  Hope everyone is well and I hope you all did naughty things at Sin City over the weekend."

I only paid $110 on mine, and I walk in today to see that I only owe $20.  I was like WTF??  Don't get me wrong, I'm happy about it, but I wrote a note to Vikki asking her to double check the tally of how much I paid.  I could swear on my kidneys that I still owed $140.  Maybe she likes me.  Afterall, I help out alot around there.  I'm one of the only girls who does the laundry, and I always do my chores and tidy up the rooms and bathrooms.  And I cover phone shifts for the daytime phone lady since she suffers from kidney disease and chronic pain as a result.  I love her to bits and don't mind covering shifts from time to time.  I like doing phones.  I dunno... maybe the boss is paying me back somehow.  Who knows.  But if it turns out that for whatever reason, I am paid up on my liscence, all the better!  That makes me really happy.  If its not paid in full by the 15th (when they're due) we can't work.  I was worried about that,  but now I'm not as stressed about it.  It seems that everything is coming together for me very nicely these days.  Such a good feeling.

"event","Well on top of the good stuff I found in my inbox this morning, the rest of my day was equally rewarding.  I did pretty good at work.  There has been alot of girls who usually work nights working during the day, and as it turns out its because the night phone lady has been not booking calls on purpose and telling clients all kinds of bogus things so they don't book.  The girls are getting fed up and they're making next to no money, so that's why they're all working during the day lately.  A note was written to the boss, Vikki, and I think action will be taken.  I understand if you're having a bad day, but to be so irresponsible as to deliberately not book calls for the girls... that's a little much.  She's costing everybody money by doing that.  So anyhow, because of so many girls being on during the day shift, its slowed down a little bit.  Today I got a call for an hour with some dude.  As it turned out I have seen him before and he tipped me $50!  I was so happy!  That's about all the good stuff at work.  Oh, when I answered the door to show another client in (the girl wasn't quite ready yet) he recognized me and he turned out to be another old regular who didn't know I was back in town.  That will turn out well, I think.

On my way to work, I stopped off at Money Mart to pick up the money Al sent me.  I walk in the door and who do I see but Andy.  Sarah and Andy.  Formerly Matt and Andy.  I was really happy.  I hadn't seen him in a while.  We chatted while we were in line and I noticed that one of the tellers was none other than my best girlfriend, Daniell.  She was the coolest chic ever.  So we're all going to go out tonight.  It should be a great night.  

And after work, I went out and got a toy for myself, and some new lingere.  I'm so excited about getting photos done!!  I trust you, Justin, don't get me wrong.  I'm just fussy about photos, no matter who's doing them.  I have total faith in you, though.  You'll have to let me know what night you're coming to do them, too.  Either you haven't told me yet or I forgot.  So I am really happy.  I've had a wonderful day of meeting people I haven't seen in a while and just good occurances.  Friday the thirteenth rules!  I think I might actually wear a dress tonight.  I haven't worn one in a while.  

Well I hope everyone else is as happy as I am, and I hope to see you all tonight!!"

They're happy e-mails with no trace of anger or bittereness.  It was so nice to have a happy e-mail from him after all this time of us bickering.  I think we just might have solved our problem!

I have got to stop sleeping in, I have realized.  No matter how hard I try, no matter what time I set my alarm for, I always end up snoozing in until damned near noon.  That's not so good!  And last night I was doing laundry and work called to ask if I could do an outcall.  Yeah, well all my clothes save for jeans and a T shirt are in the wash, so I don't think that will work.  They told me I had plenty of notice and when I pointed out that I am in a hostel and there's no promise that I will even get a drier anytime soon, therefor I'm not going to say I can do the call when I might not be able to.  She hung up on me.  Really nice.  Professional.  At least I was responsible enough to point out that I might not be able to do it, so perhaps passing it on to someone who could for certain do it would be preferred.  Oh well... I can't help the facts of life sometimes.  I can't be assured I will get a drier as soon as my wash is done.  That's just the way it is.  I am living in a hostel with like 100 other people.  There's no promise of much here.  But I like it.  It's a riot hanging out with people from all over the world.  I like to chill in the lounge and have a beer now and then.  

I keep having really weird dreams.  The night before last night, I was walking with Jared through a residential area, and I saw a cougar on a rooftop.  I said to Jared, there's a cougar, so let's just keep walking nice and calm and don't look at it.  Next thing I knew the cougar was behind Jared and then either Jared became the cougar or the other way around.  They fused or something, I guess.  Then the Jared cougar thing has its forepaws around me, and I could see the huge claws it bore, and it was getting ready to jump up into the tree.  I was scared shitless.  I pressed my face into the animal's neck and sort of screamed softly.  I looked down and the ground was easily thirty feet below.  I was terrified (the heights more than anything) and the cougar thing seemed to sense that and it took me back to the ground.  I ended up checking out this underground chapel thing, and I knew that the people that worshipped here were evil and needed to be discouraged or destroyed.  There were glasses everywhere, and I smashed them.  It was a very strange dream.  

Last night I dreampt about cats again.  I was on some ranch, and I was walking with a friend and we were each holding a cat.  Then a mad bull chased us up a tree and these fucking birds kept dive-bombing us and I was so worried about the cats.  That's about all I remember.  It was very odd, though.  And to dream of cats twice in a row... I wonder what that means...?

Well, I should go do some banking before the day wears on much farther.  Hope everyone is well and I will be at Evo tonight, so I hope to see some of you there!"

"event","I know I've been steaming about Al alot lately.  Here's the big dilemma:

I asked him for the money that I sent him back because I needed it a couple days ago.  I just got an e-mail from him saying that he's sent it back and the reference number is such and such and I can pick it up here.  That was all.  No reply to the e-mail I had sent him yesterday explaining that I am not happy with us seeming to drift apart like this.  He didn't even mention it.  Nothing.  Just strictly business.  He's been growing more and more distant as time goes on and he seems to be becoming more reluctant to talk much with me about anything.  Should I just break up with him?  What do you think is going on?  As far as I know he doesn't have a job.  I would have thought he'd tell me if he did.  He seems to be out all the time and he never e-mails anymore and I can't ever reach him by phone.  What the hell should I do?  Is it okay for me to be pissed off with him or am I over-reacting?  Ye Gods, I really don't know what's been up with him but its starting to get to me.  All I want to know is if he is moving on or not.  This silence is really immature and irresponsible.  He has no right to just let me sit and wonder like this.  I am really distraught over it.  I care for him so much and I don't want to just wash my hands of this just in case it turns out he's actually genuinely busy with something or whatever.  But on the other hand, if he's too busy to talk to me, that's the same as blowing me off.  I dunno... I really need some input on this one.  

In other news...  I have to pay my liscence for work.  I wasn't going to initially since I would only be here until Feb or early March.  But the popo have been cracking down a bit with liscences, and if I get caught without one not only do I get a hefty fine, but my boss gets a big reprimand, too.  I love Viki and I don't want to do that to her, so I have to cough up $250 in the next couple of days.  I paid $100 today while I was at work, so that's $150 to go.  At least then I can have my own ad in the Monday Mag.  Only girls who are liscenced go in there because of the whole crackdown.  Viki doesn't want to draw attention to those not paid up on their liscence.  So once I get a liscence, I might just ask Viki if I can pay her for the ad weekly and have it in there every week.  I need to increase biz a bit more.  It's been slowing down.  

On the bright side, today was my day off, and although I ended up booking on after I slept in a bit, a couple guys called and asked for me.  I guess I'm rebuilding my clientel.  That's really good.  And to think how much better biz will be when I have some hot photos for them to check out.  Yay!  As you can probably tell, I am mostly over the stigma with my job.  I am at peace with it and I don't really care if I get judged.  People judge and that's fine.  But those who judge to an extent that they will disassociate with me are the kind of people I don't want around me anyhow.  

I paid up for Feb at the hostel, so I am good until the end of Feb.  I like being here.  Aside from not being able to sleep half the time because of all the noise, the people are great.  I can go chill in the lounge and have a conversation with someone and forget about my stress for a while.  Or I can go have a beer at the bar and talk with the people there.  Its a nice distraction. 

I am really stoked on getting my photos done.  I think it will perk up business.  I hope they turn out well.  I love Justin to bits, but when it comes time to my biz, I want the best of the best.  I have to get a toy before I get the photos done, and maybe another outfit.  I want them to be HOT!  I am thinking of getting my hair and make up done so I look as good as possible.  We'll see.  If I can spare the extra few bucks it will cost to get that done, I will.  The better I look the more money I make.  And I need money!  I have the passport, so the only thing holding me back from travelling is needing the cash for the visa.  

Again, other than that, there's not much new.  Met up with Marcus today for coffee.  That was nice to hang out with him again.  He's looking well as always.  I love the new hairstyle on him.  I went with him back to his place and saw Steph and Avery.  We all watched some Cheech And Chong movie (can't remember the name).  It was terrible but in a good way.  Might go out to Evo for a drink later on... we'll see how I feel.  I'm just so pissed off that I poured my heart out to Al, expressing how sad I was that we were starting to get torn apart like this and how I still care and I miss him everyday, and all he writes back is where I can pick up the money.  Nice.  I'm going to try calling him because I want to talk to him about this on the phone.  But knowing him, he is probably out.  He knows the times I usually ring him, and it seems to me that he's making a point of being out all the time.  Fucker.  Oh well.... I don't care.  If he wants to put no effort into this, then I'm not carrying it on my back.  I have enough to deal with.  And besides, its probably better if I go to Aus without being attatched.  That way I can pick up and move somewhere else when I want to and I don't have to worry about feeling guilty for flirting with Aussie men.  I hope we can work it out, but at this point, he needs to impress me.  After him deliberately ignoring my feelings, he had better impress me if he expects anything else of me.  

Talk to you all soon... and thank you in advance for your insights.  I really have no clue what's driving his bizarre behaviour, so any guesses or advice to me would prove quite helpful, I'm certain.  The temptation to report him for sending that log of gum tree to me is overwhelming sometimes.  I can play mean, too, and I am so tempted to be a bitch to him like he's doing to me.  But I'm not going to stoop to his immature level.  I'm better than that.  Okay, I'm done ranting for now.  Hopefully things will reach a happy end, and if not, he wasn't worth my time anyway."

"event","Well, today I had a rough start.  I had a prebooking for 9:30 this monring.  Who the hell booked that!?!?  Everyone knows I drag my ass in the mornings and I am usually not showered and ready until at least 10.  And that's on a good day.  So I was hairy, smelly and cranky.  I don't care.  The guy was kinda creepy anyhow.  I was chilling out in the office talking with the girls - as per usual - and the time passed.  Around 2:30 this guy called and wanted to know if anyone on today did duos.  One of the girls did, but her usual duo partner was off, so I offered to fill in.  I was nervous about it because he wanted an interactive duo (which means the girls go at each other as well as go at him).  I have never done on before, and although I knew the girl I was doing it with and was comfortable with her, it was still a very nerve-wracking thing for me.  So I went back to the hostel to shower and shave and look presentable.  Out of respect for Seven, my partner, more than for the guy.  Like I care what the guy thinks.  So we get to the hotel room and buddy's totally drunk.  I mean, fuckin' tanked!  We get paid, call the office to let them know we're okay and funds have been issued.  We start undressing each other and doing our thing.  Fast forward a bit (sorry guys, but no details use your imaginations!) and I'm sitting on buddy's face while Seven is giving him a hand job.  I point down to his crotch and she looks down to see something I noticed right away.  He had balls of toilet paper stuck in his asscrack!!  And he stank!  Oh my fucking God did he stink!  Like stale shit and sweaty balls.  Thank God there was two of us to share the joy of his nasty rotten crotch.  I would have gagged on my own.  So anyhow, she starts laughing, and I start laughing, and we end up in a fit of hysterics and buddy was so drunk he didn't seem to notice, and if he did he probably thought it was just that we were having so much fun we were being giggly girls.  Um... no.  We were laughing at his little ass adornments.  God we had so much fun doing that call.  We confessed that if it was either of us alone, it would have been the longest half hour of our lives, but together we had a blast.  So now I have a duo partner and we are so comfortable with each other now.  Getting naked and all touchy will do that to people.  You tend to bond after something like that.  So that was my day at work.  
I thought the light in my room had burnt out at the hostel, and got them to change the light bulb.  That one didn't work.  Then I realized that the little dimmer knob actually was a button, too, and I pushed it and sure enough, blinding lights searing my retinae.  I felt like such a moron.  
I got approval from my boss to have Justin do my photos at work.  I am excited about it.  Justin's been looking for a good reason to get my clothes off, so I'm sure he's stoked on it, too.  I've gotta go get a new toy and maybe some new lingere for the photos.  I've got until next Tuesday to fundraise and go shopping.  Anyone want to accompany me and give their opinions?  I never know what guys like because to me half of it looks skanky and the other half looks like something my grandma would wear.  
Looking forward to hanging out with Marcus tomorrow.  Oh!  And I got an e-mail from Tara, an Irish girl I met this past summer.  She's coming to town for a few days soon and we're gonna hook up and go for a few pints.  That should be fun.  We haven't seen each other for like four months, and even then we only hung out for a couple days.  I'm so happy I am keeping in touch with some of the people I met this summer.  The contacts will come in handy when I am travelling.  
Well that's about all, I hope everyone is well.  Will update again soon, as always."

"event","Well today I was expecting news to come in the mail as to whether or not I got my passport.  I got it.  I was thinking that since I wasn't there to sign for the mail (registered) that I would have to go down to the post office to retrieve it.  Nope.  There was an envelope for me at the front desk when I dragged my ass out of bed, and I opened it up to find my shiny new passport inside.  I have to say, my passport photo doesn't really look too bad.  I've seen much worse, let's just put it that way.  I'm really happy about that.  Today I went to the bank for the first time in over six months and put $200 on my VISA and deposited the rest into my account.  I guess since it's been so long since I've put a payment on my VISA, they turned it over to collections.  I don't even know if I can use my VISA once its paid off.  I guess I'll wait to see.  I updated my mailing information so they can mail me my statements and shit.  And I think I am also going to pay off my Telus and my Roger's bills before I go, too.  I have to start being more responsible, and that means I have to pay my debts.  If I leave them unpaid, it will totally fuck over my credit, and I don't know if that will affect my ability to get citizenship in another country or not.  I know for sure it will bite me in the ass when the time comes for me to apply for a loan or a mortgage.  Time to start acting like an adult.  As much as I want to go travelling, I should take care of loose ends here before I do.  

That said, I might end up going back to Vancouver.  Or maybe Saskatoon like I was originally thinking.  We'll see how biz goes in Victoria over the rest of the month.  I want to go where I make the most money because I have alot of shit to pay for.  About $3500 in debts, plus the $4000 for my visa and plane ticket.  That's alot to save.  So I don't know if I am even going to bother writing Al to tell him that I might be several more months in getting to Australia.  I am going to talk to one of those debt consolodator people to see if I can have all my outstanding debts piled into one lump sum, which I can make monthly payments on.  That way I can still travel without having to worry about paying it all off before I go.  I'll just have to make sure I can transfer money from Aus somehow, which won't be a problem.  

I am really glad that I went out on Saturday.  I was being a little naughty, but oh well.  I felt like shit and I was really depressed and feeling very unloved and unattractive, so I did what I knew would cheer me up the fastest.  And it worked.  Temporarily.  It was so good to see everyone again.  So many good people were out that night, I was so happy I decided to go out.  I crashed at Jared's that night, and we ended up spending the whole day the next day playing vids and watching tv.  Thank you Jared.  I really needed to be around people and you were very patient and kind to me.  

I still feel really sad and lonely, though.  I really miss Al, but on the other hand, I don't miss the bullshit.  I'm living in a hostel with literally a hundred other people, but I always feel so isolated and alone.  It sucks.  And I am reluctant to go out and do things because that costs money, and I have so much to save for.  Last night I tossed and turned for half the night, and finally went to sleep.  I'm really pissed off about the iPod going on the fritz.  I have always had music playing as often as possible, and now that small luxury's been stripped from me like so many others.  I'm bitter, I know.  It's really hard not to be.  I guess I am just happy that I am in Victoria where I know people and where if I get really lonely, I can always go out to Evo and see people who give a damn (or pretend to).  

That reminds me...  if anyone knows anyone who has a digital camera and photoshop who wants to make an easy $100 let me know.  I need photos done for work, but the usual guy is incommunicado, so I figure I'd put the offer out you guys.  Nothing too saucy.  Just a few shots of me in lingere and a few of me nude, touch em up on photoshop and then e-mail them to my boss so she can put them on the site.  That's it.  Let me know if anyone's interested.  If I had nice photos, I'd make more money, and be more inclined to stay in Victoria.  And I just like having my photos taken ^_^  

Well that's about all that's new.  I sent Al an e-mail with a link to the big rant I posted on here a couple days ago.  I told him that I thought he needed to read it.  I think he does.  He needs to see how I am feeling and what my thoughts are.  Daniel and I agree that Al isn't a very good listener, and that he's kinda immature.  I mean, what was the first clue?  Daniel asked me why I am still bothering with Al.  I don't really know.  I guess its because I really care for him and he's not all that bad.  But he's bad in the spots where its most important to be good.  **sigh**  Why does life have to keep dolling out the hard lessons to me?  As if I didn't go through enough last year, this year's off on a bang.  I swear I must be a strong girl since I keep getting all the big struggles and hard choices thrown at me.  I wonder what the rest of my life has in store for me.  Whatever it is, it's big.  I'm being prepared for something.  

Well, Marcus, I hope to hear from you soon....  I am looking forward to hanging out on Weds.  Haven't hung out with you since the summer.  That seems like a lifetime ago!  Justin, good to see you and you have my number and if you lost it again, its somewhere in an earlier LJ post.  Lorna, **hug** you look stunning as always.  Hope things are well with you, love.  Jared, thanks again for being there.  I really just needed to not be alone.  Daniel, I will call you, I swear.  Just have to start realizing I'm still alive first."

So now I have no man and no music.  Its like the end of the world for me.  How am I supposed to deal with life with no music?  Fuck I am so angry and frustrated and bitter right now.

"event","All Al and I seem to be able to do since he left is bicker and argue.  We never fought while he was still here.  And now its all we ever seem to do.  I don't know what the cause of it is, but here we are nonetheless.  We talked on the phone last night and ended up getting into the worst argument we've been in to date.  He says that we are still together, that he doesn't want to break up, but that maybe it would be best if we didn't talk on the phone anymore and keep e-mails to a minimum.  What the fuck?  So I don't know what that's supposed to mean.  We're still a couple, but we should keep contact between us to a barest minimum?  How is that a relationship?  Why are we bothering to stay together when he's made clear that he doesn't want me to write or call anymore.  I'd rather be single than be in a relationship with a figment of my imagination.  Its fucking retarded.  I don't know what the hell to do about it because I care for him alot, and although the distance is the cause of all the stress and tension between us, I fail to see how aboloshing contact will solve it.  If anything its going to make it worse.  For me, anyhow.  I like to talk to people that I'm involved with - as most people do.  Who wants to date someone you can't see and can't talk to?  This whole pile of shit makes no sense, and I think Al's being a dickweed about it.  Let's just ignore the problem and act like nothing's wrong until it goes away.  Well I asked him what he thinks we're going to do when my year in Australia is up.  I pointed out that I can't get citizenship to Aus, and he doesn't have citizenship in any other country, therefore most of the time we will be in different countries.  I pointed out that just not talking to each other to avoid an argument is hardly going to solve the problem.  And its going to leave me even more lacking than I already am.  I am stressed out because I am dating someone I can't ever see.  Talking to him was all I had.  Now he tells me he thinks we ought to can that, too?  So how is that supposed to not make me even more stressed out about this than I already am?  How is this supposed to get me to not foster hate and bitterness towards him?  Honey I care, but let's not talk anymore.  Nice.  Fucking git.  I can't believe he's done this to me, and he thinks its the right course of action.  But if I tell him my case, which is a more logical one, I think, he'll just over-ride me with his own thoughts.  He's horrible with stuff like that.  He won't even try my ideas for solving our problems.  He gives me no leeway.  He won't compromise and he never seems to want to try any of my suggestions or ideas.  Yes, he's got six years on me, but I've been in more relationships than him, and all of them have lasted longer than his longest one - a paltry three months.  I think I have a little more experience with what works and what doesn't in relationships.  Does he see that?  Nope.  Does he care?  Doesn't seem to.  What am I supposed to do about it?  He seems to expect me to just be okay with not talking to him on top of not being able to see him.  Fuck!  I hate this long distance thing.  He's so stubborn, too.  He insists that the only way to work this out is to wait until we can talk face to face.  Well, that's great, but don't you think that that's rather obvious?  The whole problem stems from the fact that there's some-odd thousand miles between us.  Of course it's going to be better when we're face to face again!!  What a brilliantly deductive observation!  Fuck he can be so stupid sometimes!  I don't care about then because then there will be no problem.  What's going on now is what concerns me.  There's a problem now and if he actually puts a little effort into it and actually listens to my suggestions and ideas we can find a happy medium now.  But that's not good enough for him, apparently.  How is that fair for him to expect me to be faithful to him when he won't let me talk to him, and I can't see him?  Does he not see how this is only making things harder on me?  Yes, he's got school to focus on and blah blah blah, but what about me?  Its not like I was demanding of his time.  I brought up the fact that he hasn't been writing as much as he used to, and he made me feel like shit about it.  And I never called him everyday or anything like that.  I always asked him if my calling was at a bad time or anything.  All I wanted was to talk to him a few times a week on the phone, and to have him e-mail me like he used to.  But somehow that got turned around and he managed to make me feel like shit about it and now I can't talk to him at all.  He's very good at making me feel like shit about asking for anything.  It's not like I have high expectations or anything.  And if I do, its because he's the one that set the bar that high.  He used to write me everyday, so how am I wrong to miss that?  Why should I feel like shit because I miss something?  He's being so unreasonable and so  childish about this whole situation.  I love him to bits, but he's doing nothing but making it harder and harder for me to keep caring about him.  He's refusing to compromise and he digs his heels in whenever I tell him I need something.  How am I not supposed to harbour bitterness and hatred for him?  He treats me like this when my needs are legitimate and my requests reasonable?  And I'm just supposed to be okay with all this and not be bitter or angry?  He does this as a control technique.  He's so afraid of being controlled that he won't give any leeway or compromise.  So when something isn't going the way he wants it, he just up and walks away from it.  Because its easier to ignore the issue than to work together to solve it.  Working together involves being open to each other's ideas, which means he'd have let his guard down.  Compromising and finding a mutually satisfactory solution isn't one controlling the other.  There's no control drama going on there at all.  That's what a compromise is about.  But he doesn't grasp that concept.  He's so fixated on making sure he doesn't get manipulated or controlled that he himself ends up being controlling!  His control tactic is to leave the problem unsolved because I want it solved.  He leaves me hanging without a conclusion and just walks out the door or cuts off communication.  He told me over the phone that he deliberately does the opposite of what people ""expect"" him to do because he hates when people expect things of him.  And that's okay?  He doesn't see how that's a control tactic?  He doesn't see how his stubbornness is a direct contribution to our difficulties?  I'm finding it harder and harder to want to bother with him.  I mean, honestly.  He does nice things for me and he's great in bed, but he treats me like crap.  He has no respect for how I am feeling or what I need to feel better.  He won't pull his head out of his ass and do something that I want him to do because it would make me happier or help me to not be so stressed out.  He only does things when he wants to.  Doesn't matter how much I need something, simply because I need it he won't do it.  Rather than dealing with issues, he likes to go for long walks and stay out half the day, or longer, and knowingly leave me in an upset and stressed out state.  Going for a walk has always seemed a bigger priority to him than solving problems as they come up.  And he never wants to talk about anything.  I don't mind if you need time to gather your thoughts, but taking half a day or longer is a control tactic.  An hour or two at the most is sufficient.  And taking time only does some good if you actually talk about the problem afterwards.  No offense, Jared, but I was in a relationship similar to this for 8 months and I wasn't really that happy.  And now I'm back here again.  I don't want to be with someone who would rather ignore problems than work on solving them.  I don't want to be with someone who can't listen to what I need and provide me with it, so long as its reasonable like a hug or a comforting e-mail or accompanying me on a walk or similar small comforts.  I don't want to be with someone who won't come with me to a movie unless its one he wants to see.  I don't want to be with someone who has no idea of how to compromise or make small sacrifices for the other person.  I am the kind of girl who will bend over backwards for my man.  I will sit through a crappy movie because I'd rather be with them during a shit movie than not be with them.  I will do things I don't want to do, like go for a beer or two or walk to the park, because I would rather spend that time with my man.  The way I see it, if they ask me along its because they want me to come along.  So why not go?  Are there no men like that?  Why is it that every time I asked Al along to do something he'd always say no unless it was something he wanted to do.  But almost everytime he asked me I said yes.  Where is a man that's on my level?  What am I going to do about Al?  Will he smarten the fuck up and learn to be mature?  Will he drop his control fixations and learn what a compromise is?  I don't know what to do about this.  I am so lost and so confused and so angry that I really have no clue what to do.  This whole situation is retarded.  And its all because Al refuses to make any attempt at a compromise.  He won't e-mail me because I want him to.  He won't do anything because I want him to.  As long as I don't want it, he'll do it.  That's not the kind of guy I want to be with.  I need things from people in life, just like everyone needs things.  If someone is deliberately with-holding simply because I want it, that only goes to show the level of maturity of that person.  If you care about someone, you shouldn't with-hold things because you don't agree with them wanting or needing it.  You should provide it because you care for that person and you should want to do nice things for them.  He's so scared of being walked on that he makes being with him an incredible challenge.  Just because I am asking him for something doesn't mean I am walking all over him.  It doesn't mean that I am going to start asking for more and more.  It just means that I need something at that moment and I am asking for it.  That's all.  No big ulterior motive, no underhanded control tactics.  Just me needing a hug and asking for it, or me needing a few bucks and asking for it.  That's all.  I wish he could see that.  I don't want to walk all over him, I don't want to subdue him or control him, I don't want to be anything but equal with him.  He's so beautiful and so amazing to me, but he's got to stop thinking the worst of people.  I want to hold him, not chain him.  I want to love him, not smother him.  I want to be his equal, not his underling or overlord.  I want us to lean on each other, not look to be carried by one another.  I just wish he could see that.  I wish more than anything I could somehow convince him that my intent is pure and my heart is open.  But he's not ready for that, I don't think.  He still wants to believe that people are cruel and mean and seek to dominate and control.  Its in a place in his mind and heart so deep I can't reach it.  And it will be up to him to dig it up and throw it out.  I just wish so much that he could trust my purity.  The first night we met he was puking his guts out on the sidewalk and I sat out there with him and brought him water and a blanket.  I didn't even know him.  He kept asking me over and over why I was doing that for him, what I wanted out of it, what was I getting out of it.  And I kept saying nothing, I wanted nothing but to help, I helped because a creature of such beauty shouldn't be sick alone.  He couldn't grasp it then, and he still can't.  Such a wounded creature, such a beautiful fallen angel.  I love him so much, I just wish he could see that."

"event","Well, Al and I are in it again.  I know how stupid this may sound to those who don't know what its like to be victim of your own subconscious, but I keep pushing him away.  I don't want to push him away, but somehow I end up doing it to him.  He's the most amazing person I've ever met and its so hard for me to just accept that he really cares about me for who and what I am and that he isn't wasting his time on me or screwing me around somehow.  We exchanged a couple of e-mails over the past few days and I am waiting to hear what his final say on the matter is.  I told him that although I don't mean to do what I've been doing, I won't say it will change because it won't.  I can't change years of programming overnight.  I told him to really think about that, because if he cares and decides he still wants to be with me then he's going to have to be patient with me while I slowly work out my glitches.  I hate waiting for him to write back.  It's killing me!  I guess I have to just try not to think too much about it and wait to see what he says.  
I got a package from him today.  He sent me a cute little stuffed platypus, a couple cds, a lovely bracelet, and a stick.  I do Yule, and the big tradition is to burn a Yule Log.  He was out walking and said this one stick called to him, so he sent it to me.  It was a ballsy move for him because he could have gotten himself into major shit for mailing organic matter out of Australia.  No small offense, that is.  I am goin gto go down to the beach tomorrow to burn it.  Tonight one of the girls from the hostel is going to drink with me.  She's cool and I really like her.  I need to do some heavy drinking.  It will take my mind of matters of Al.  
I sent off my passport, too.  If I get approved **crossed fingers** they said it should be ready on the 9th.  Work's slowed down finally.  I am not happy about that.  I might not be able to save the $500 minimum per week I need to get to Australia by the end of January.  We'll see what happens.  I will be here long enough to figure out whether or not I have my passport.  I am nervous about the job and residency thing.  I have been back and forth between here and Vancouver for so long that there's a wierd kind of look to my info on jobs and residence.  I don't see it as being a big problem.  It's not like where I've been living is as important as my guarantor or my personal references who say that, yes, I am a citizen and I'm a good person, yadda yadda yadda.  We'll see.  If I get my passport and things don't pick  up again at work, I'll go to another city again.  If I get my passport and things are good at work, I'll stay here.  And if for some reason I don't get my passport, I have to figure out what the fuck I'm going to do.  But I try not to think on that possiblilty.  
Nothing else new, really.  Picked up the mail my dad sent me.  There were 10 $10 telus pay and talk cards.  That saved me $100 for cell phone minutes.  Thanks dad, you rule!!  Haven't called my mom in a while.  I reckon I should get around to doing that sometime soon.  
Oh!!  I'm fucking choked!!  I got my period last night, and just as luck would have it, today has been really busy at work.  Go figure.  I can't work because I'll bleed all over the place, no matter if I use a sponge or not.  I flow really heavy, which is why my cycle usually only lasts for three or four days.  It sucks, though, because there's so few girls on now that its so close to Christmas... I would have made at least $400 today, for sure.  And I might not be able to work tomorrow, either.  I think I might, just to make some cash.  I don't care.  Today I'm crampy and feeling blah cause its the first day.  If I don't feel crampy tomorrow I'll work.  I need the money more than I need to worry about some guy seeing a little blood.  Most of them want a ""girlfriend experience"" well... they'll get one!!  
That's about all, folks.  I'll update in a few days.  Hope everyone has a good Christmas, or Yule, or whatever you celebrate."

But I don't know if I can stay at this hostel for another month or so, so if anyone knows of anyone who has a room for rent, let me know.  I'm going to check Monday Mag just in case, but we'll see what the hostel people say tomorrow.  I guess they don't do monthlies for anybody.  I get to go see that psychic lady tomorrow, too!  I am so excited about that!  I have wanted to see her for a while, but never got around to calling to set up an appointment.  But last week I got the strong feeling that I should go see her, so I think it might be interesting.  I'll write about it tomorrow.  Other than that, nothing new.  Hope everyone is doing well...."

"event","Well I am at Ocean Island now.  The guys the the Turtle were being dick heads.  I didn't like it there, anyways.  OI is nice!  The beds are bigger the rooms bigger and there's a bar downstairs!  Sweet!  I'm happy there.  
So I was talking to a couple of the people I work with yesterday, and one of the girls suggested that I get someone to put some money in my bank account just long enough to get approved for the visa.  I had already thought of that, but figured if I played dumb, maybe something good will come of it.  I was right!  Richard, who's one of the drivers, told me he'd front me $2000 for a couple days.  So now all I have to make is about $3000.  Not too bad!  I already have almost a grand that I've made this week alone!  I'll get to that in a minute.  So I should be ready to go to Australia sometime at the end of January or the beginning of February.  Fuck, that's so exciting!!
So work.  It's been busier than it should be this time of year.  Usually it slows down from early December until after tax season, but we've been doing over 50 calls per day!  Mind you we're open from 9AM until 7AM, so that's alot of time.  I got an outcall to a hotel on Tuesday night.  This guy wanted to see me for 2 hours.  He seemed a little odd but relatively okay when I got there.  He ended up wanting to extend the appointment by another 8 hours.  Okay, fine.  No problem.  We gave me the extra $1000 it costs for 8 hours and that was that.  Shortly after that he began to get very strange.  He was drinking red wine constantly and he went through three bottles by the time the third hour was ending.  A bottle an hour, more or less.  He was also popping Xanax, or Zanax.  He would be really nice one minute and then be a dick the next.  I was really uncomfortable being there.  It was scary.  His eyes were dead.  It was like being with a zombie.  A totally unpredictable zombie.  And I was stuck there for another 7 hours!!  Finally after the 4th hour into the 8 hours (so I had been there for 6 hours by that point) he passes out.  I was so scared and uncomfortable that I didn't want to sit there for another 4 hours.  I called my boss and told her what was going on.  She said to give him a shake and see if it was okay with him if I left since he was passed out anyhow.  Okay, fine.  Thank fucking God!  Then as I'm going he gets all bitchy with me and starts being a real dick again.  Fucking scared the hell out of me.  I had a crappy day!  Ever since then I find myself unable to get into work again.  I am usually great at faking it and being all sweet and bubbly, but I just couldn't when I saw another client.  I felt really bad because I knew it wasn't his fault and that it was my own shit, but I couldn't help it.  So at least I have tomorrow off.  
I will be at Evo later on since Evan is in town and I haven't seen him in a few months.  I haven't been to Evo in a long time, so it will be good to get out and let loose for a while.  And having tomorrow off, I don't have to worry about being up at 8:30AM.  
Al and I are doing well.  The distance is really playing games with my head, though.  I find it harder and harder to keep my faith in him and to trust what I know of him when so many people are telling me he'll cheat or he'll fuck me over, or whatever.  I have to stop listening to other people and listen to my heart, which is harder than it sounds.  
I booked an appointment with a spiritual counsellor, too.  I read about her in the Monday Mag a while ago, and she always held a certain appeal to me.  I just got the strong feeling that I needed to book an appointment with her a couple nights ago.  So I did.  I see her Tuesday morning.  I'm really excited to see how it turns out.  
Oh!  And I quit smoking.  Or I think I did, anyways.  I might break and buy a pack on my way to the bar.  We'll see.  That's about all that's new with me.  I'll post again soon.  Hope everyone else is doing well...."

"event","Well, I am ready to go to the staff party tonight, but I'm not supposed to meet them for another couple of hours.  **sigh**  I hate waiting for things.  Like waiting to get to Austrailia.  That's killing me.  I send Al an e-mail to let him know that I'll be back from the party around 1 or so tonight, so if he's home then good, if he's not, then I'll call him another night.  He wrote me last night telling me that he was sorry that he wasn't around for me to talk to but he would be at home tonight for me.  What does that mean?  For me?  I told him if he wants to go out, then fucking go out.  I'll call him another night.  I would like to talk to him sooner as opposed to later, but if I have to wait, then I'll wait.  Its not a big deal.  But I think that's really sweet of him to stay in so I could call him.  Although I don't know what eles he'd do.  Probably go down to the beach.  He said living with his family again after 11 years was stressful on him.  No doubt!  I'd go fucking crazy!!  But he's a good man, so he'll get by.  I hope he starts looking for work soon.  He's pretty much out of money, and that alone is a huge stress factor.  I can send him money now and then, sure, but the more money I send him the longer it will take for me to get to Australia.  He's helped me out in so many ways, I don't mind sending him some much-needed cash.  I already sent him $200 last Tuesday, and I think I'm going to send him another couple hundred this Tuesday.  He needs it whether he admits to it or not.  I know he'd rather be working and finishing school and living in his own place, but right now that's not an option, so he's just going to have to accept my money.  He said he's just going to put it in the bank and whatever he spends he'll replace.  I don't care if he replaces it or not.  I am giving him that money so he can go for a beer when he wants to go for a beer, and so he can have a little bit of money to get around town to look for work with.  I wish there was more I could do for Al, but I can't do much from here.  I am ready to send my passport application in, finally.  I lost the other one and I had to go get new photos and another application.  All I have to do is get ahold of my dentist to be my guarantor and I'm good to go.  With that out of the way, I can go ahead and book a flight to Asu as soon as I get close to having my $5000 in the bank.  I'm not going to tell Al, of course.  It will ruin the big surprise I have for him.  I don't know if I wrote about my plan or not, but here's what I'm gonna do:
I'm going to get to Aus without him knowing I'm coming.  I have his sister's e-mail address so I'll get her help on this.  I'm sure his mother will want a piece of the action, too.  Afterall, he son's in love with a foreigner... she'll want to see this all unfold.  I'm going to stop in Vancouver for a couple days before my flight so I can get a chunk of metoerite made into a pendant and put onto a chain for Al.  Being a doctor of geology, I think its fitting.  I'm also going to pick up this beautiful outfit I saw in Gastown.  Its a lovely white satin skirt, full length, and it fits close to the hips and waist, then slowly flares out so it sits in a nice little pool of white satin around the feet.  And the matching corsette, as well.  Me and corsettes....   I'm going to catch a flight that gets me into Aus in the morning, so I have most of the day to finish the last of the surprise.  Make my way to the Gold Coast, check into a honeymoon suite for two or three nights.  Unpack the beer I'm going to bring for Al, and set up some candles and shit.  Shower and change into the white outfit.  Go to a salon and get my hair done up with baby's breath and white roses.  Do my make-up on the way to the florist, where I will pick up a white rose corsage to pin on my breast.  Find a karaoke bar (sister will help with this, I'm sure) and get them to play HIM's ""When Love And Death Embrace"" at a set time for me.  Get someone to bring Al there (sister and mother will help with that again, I'm certain) so he's there for the set time of my song.  I'm going to be a bundle of nerves, but I'm going to walk out and sing that song for him looking like a million bucks and he's not going to know what hit him.  Then when the song's done, I'm going to give him the meteorite pendant.  Then we're going to do alot of hugging and kissing and staring in total disbelief that I actually made it to Aus, and we're going to spend a few nights together in a swank honeymoon suite.  The perfect surprise, I think.  I get to dress up nice and be a girly girl, and Al gets beer, and lots of time in bed with me.  He's going to flip out!!  I can't wait to see the look on his face when I walk into his line of vision looking like a princess.  I got the Swarovsky Christmas ornament that they put out every year.  Its a really nice crystal shaped like a star.  I'm going to wear that as my necklace.  It's pretty, but since its clear crystal, it doesn't take away from the rest of my outfir.  I'm actually wearing it right now.  The girls at work are going to fawn over it, I just know it.  Ever since I saw them a couple years ago, I always thought they'd make a grand necklace.  I was right.  They do.  Just under $100.  That's not bad for Swarovsky.  
Anyhow, I think I should go get something to eat.  I'll write about the party later.  I'm sure I'll have lots to write about!!"

She's probably shelled out a fair whack of cash for that.  I don't really want to go, but I need to get some photos done, so I have to be at the party.  I don't know how its going to go.  There'll be alot of coke and E and I'm not used to being around that shit.  I'll be the only straight-edged person there.  I'm not doing any drugs and I am not even going to have a drink.  I don't care if some of the girls think its weird.  At least I know my liver and spinal fluids will be okay in another 20 years.  
Last night sucked balls.  I made good money at work that day, but when I got back to the hostel, I found myself really missing Al.  More than I've missed him yet.  And he was in Brisbane for a couple days visiting a friend of his, so I couldn't even get ahold of him for comfort and consolation.  I tossed and turned for hours before I finally slept.  I just felt really lonely and I felt like it was going to be a huge struggle for me to give up all the things I have in Victoria and go all the way to Australia on a summer romance.  I care for Al immensely, and I know that he cares for me, too.  I don't know the degree to which he cares, but he doesn't take our relationship casually, that much I know for sure.  I just miss having him there physically.  He wrote me that nothing in our relationship has changed, only the distance between us has, and although its a pain in the ass, we can work around it.  He's so sweet to me.  He always finds the right thing to say, or comes pretty damned near to saying the right thing.  I can't wait to get back from the staff party tonight so I can call him.  It's been so long since we've spoken on the phone.  
Well, I should probably get moving for the day... I promised Al I would go feed the squirrels at the park.  It's just no fun without him, though.  Brings back memorys of when we were still together, and I could put my arm around him and kiss him on the cheek.  Fuck I miss him....."

I am so much happier since I met him, and even though he's absent, that happiness hasn't faded.  He's so caring, too.  He likes to know that I am well taken care of.  Shit, he went and spent most of the money his work owed him on me!  Buying me more tiger's eye jewellery, an iPod, dinner, beers...  He just gives and gives of himself so much and so often.  And I do the same thing, too.  It's nice to be with someone who I feel totally and completely on level with.  I swear Al is my other half.  We have so many parallels between us.  And there were fireworks from day one with the two of us.  Everyone at the hostel saw it coming except us.  From the first time we actually talked to each other, we were hooked.  From that first night onwards we spent time together everyday.  Then he went up to Nanaimo for the weekend, and I walked him down to the bus station.  We had our first kiss there.  It was nice.  Something for him to think about on his trip up to Nanaimo and back.  He got back from Nanaimo and we started to spend more time together.  We fell more and more in love with each other, and to this very day, we both feel the same intensity that we felt at the start.  If Al isn't the man of my life, I couldn't imagine who would be.  What man could ever top Al for me?  What man would ever come even par with Al in my eyes and in my heart?  God, I wish I were in Australia right now.  I hate being away from my baby.  But I am getting by in the meantime.  Like we all do..."

"event","Well as it turns out, my worries about Al were unwarrented (as usual).  He was just taking a break from the world for a bit he said.  He headed up to Brisbane for the weekend, but took the time to write me a sweet and endearing e-mail telling me that he's not mad.  So good to know!  
Nothing really new otherwise.  Things in Victoria are okay.  I don't mind being back here.  All during the summer, though, I hated being here.  I guess after being away, I realize its not so bad here.  Anyhow, I should go to work and try to make some cash.
Oh, something I just found out...  One of the guys at the hostel (the manager, not the owner) has been charging me $90 a week for the dorm, when the manager told me I could have it for $70 a week.  Save myself some cash doing that.  Fucking Ben, the manager.  He's ripped me and Al off before.  He's always out to make himself a buck regardless of anything else.  He's a typical two faced greed monger.  Two or three more months, and I can be out of here, though.  I can squeak by on about $5000 worth of savings.  $4000 for the visa, and the extra grand to cover the brunt of my ticket.  That's plenty.  I can live off of less than $800 a month, so $4000 will last a long time in Aus.  We'll see... send me happy money vibes, please, cause the sooner I get my money, the sooner I can go be happy.

"event","Well, sort of, anyways...  Works' been nice and steady lately, so I've been able to walk home with a couple hundred every day.  That's always nice, especially since I will need about $4000 just to get approved for my working visa to Aus.  Then I need another $1000 or so for airfare.  I think is what I am going to do is save up around $3000 or so, and then ask people I know if they want to donate a little bit of money to my Getting To Australia Fund.  Just stick whatever they can into my account long enough for my visa to get approved, then they can have their money back.  I am not going to need $4000 to be there.  I am going to take a couple weeks to just enjoy the new lifestyle and see a few sights, but I am going to start working within a month of getting there.  I am certainly not going to go blow $4000 in three weeks!!  So we'll see how that works.  Anyone who's reading this let me know if you are game for that, cause unless I get about $1000 worth of people's cash, its not really worth it.  But we'll see.  Like I said before, the money would only be in my account for three or four days.  A week at the most.  
So Al and I got into it on the phone last night.  I was really depressed because he is so far away and I miss him so much.  I guess he heard it in my voice right away and wanted me to talk about it.  I didn't want to, but I didn't want him to think I was keeping anything from him, either.  It ended up as an argument.  Not a really bad one, we never have bad ones.  But still... the last thing I wanted was to have any kind of conflict with him.  Especially because we can't just comfort each other like we could if we were in person.  The distance makes everything so much harder!  Today there was no e-mail in my inbox from him, so I figured he might be mad at me for something.  So I wrote him another of my epic e-mails, and finally the truth came out.  I told him that I would rather die than see him leave my life and I was really worried about him travelling around so much.  I mean, I would go anywhere to be with him, but the question remains, can I keep up??  I wrote him all of this and told him that I care for him more than I've ever cared for anyone else in my life.  I had to get it out.  At least the distance is good for something.  So I guess if he writes back and tells me that I am being too intense or whatever, I think I am just going to scrap the idea of going to Aus to see him.  I'll still go because I want to, but I won't go anywhere where he is.  At least now he knows how strongly I feel for him.  He can't pretend he doesn't know anymore.  I'm really nervous about the whole situation, though.  I mean, I know he cares, but I wish I knew how much he cared.  And he's known for sometime now that I really am madly in love with him.  I guess I'm just worried that he'll decide that he doens't want to be with me afterall because of what I said.  We'll see... if he doens't e-mail me by tomorrow morning, I'm just going to let it be.  I'll stop e-mailing and calling him until he makes the first move.
Speaking of first moves, I was online earlier today and Jared poppped online.  I said hey, figuring if he didn't want to talk, then cool.  We ended up going for coffee.  It was so good to see him again.  His fucking hair is still blue from his Halloween costume of Milhouse.  He was telling me about how he's moving to Vancouver, and all about the new vids he got.  He's got Metroid for NSE.  I told him I had best be invited to come over and play sometime.  I can't wait!!  It's really good to see him again.  I missed him, but was never wanting to be the one to make contact in case he didn't want to talk to me.  Turns out that my worries were unwarrented, and he seemed really stoked about meeting up with me.  
Other than that, things have been good.  As I said, work has been treating me well.  Money's good for Victoria, so I am working as much as I can to bank all the money I can make.  Should be able to bank about $800 or so a week.  $300 a month at the hostel and $5 or $10 to live off of per day.  I have to quit smoking, though.  It's too expensive.  And so are phone cards!!  Fuck, I go through a $10 phone card everynight talking to Al.  And I only get a couple hours out of it!!  Its really expensive calling him, but I miss him so much I can't really help myself.  I'm not going to go to San Fransisco for Christmas.  It's going to cost me more money than I want to spend.  And besides, it will just be the three Aussies, and I will see them in a few months when they go back to Aus.  I don't need to go anywhere for the holidays.  
Called my dad for the first time in six months or so.  He was happy to hear from me.  He's going to send me something for Christmas.  God, I hope its something useful.  I am living out of a backpack, so anything that I can't use is going to get left behind.  And I have to go through all the things I have in storage and figure out what I want to keep and what I want to get rid of.  My crystals and things I am going to have mailed to Aus.  Most big things I am going to try to sell or give away.  Down to the bare minimals now.  No more time or money or space for creature comforts. 
Well, I should get organized here... I am going over to my mother's place for dinner and to do some laundry.  I went and got another set of passport photos done today since I can't for the life of me find my other ones.  I am going to do the application tonight and send it in tomorrow.  Its high time I got my fucking lazy ass in gear.  Having Al gone is good for that, at least.  Now I have motivation to get organized: no passport and visa, no more holding Al on cold nights.  That simple.  Hope everyone is well..."

"event","Well yesterday was the end of the best summer ever.  I know summer ended a few months back, but having Al leave was the final shock of truth that the greatest summer of my life has ended, and I will never be able to duplicate it.  Al and I finally got a private room at the hostel in Victoria for our last night together.  We woke up way too early after going to bed way too late.  I overheard him and his buddy Warren (waza in Aussie-speak) talking about me after I had gone to lay down.  Al said, and I quote, ""I really like her, yeah, but I'm not going to hold my breath"".  He was referencing me coming to Australia to be with him.  He doesn't think I will!!  When Al came to bed a few minutes later, I confronted him about it.  I asked him why I should bother going all the way there if he's not really even expecting me.  How do I know he won't have found another bird?  How do I know he even wants me to come?  We talked for a while and I think I finally convinced him that, yes dear, I AM coming to Aus to be with you.  We had phenominal sex and though we didn't know it at the time, it turned out to be the last real romp we'd have for some time.  
So in the morning, my beloved made me an omlette with some orange slices and orange juice.  I told him the night before that I was getting sick and I needed something citrus.  We ate breakfast and I updated my iPod while he complained of a hangover.  Poor guy...  We were on the 3 o'clock ferry and we were listening to music on the bus ride to Schwartz Bay.  Once on the ferry, we settled in and spent the voyage watching Simpsons and South Park on Al's laptop.  
We got into the hostel in Vancouver at around 7PM.  At first they gave us a crappy old private room that neither me nor Al liked.  I went down to the office to see if there was any way we could switch to another room if one was available.  As it turned out, we got the same room we were in the whole time we were in Vancouver!  How's that for lucky!  We dropped our bags and headed out for some pizza.  
Al took me out to a local brewpub and we had a beer.  Halfway through my beer I noticed that there were shards of glass stuck all around the rim of my glass.  And as I looked closer, I saw that there were more shards of glass pasted to the inside of my glass.  I called the waitress and told her.  She looked really disgusted and got me another beer.  About 5 minutes later, the manager came by to apologise and told us our beer was on the house.  I told him that we had already paid, and I had already recieved a complimentary beer, but you could give one to my man here.  So Al and I both got a free beer out of the ordeal.  I'm sick, too, and everytime my throat gets sore or itchy, I can't help but to wonder it its little bits of glass stuck in my throat.  
We went back to the hostel and cuddled in bed.  He downloaded some more episodes of Simpsons and shit to tide him over on the long, long flight home.  I donwloaded a few more bits of music to stick on my iPod.  We finally slept.  We got up and went to Stanley Park the next day.  We took damned near three pounds worth of nuts with us.  Ferocious Pete, the really little squirrel that Al and I fell in love with, got about a pound's worth of nuts all to his little self.  We fed the other, bigger ones, and we spotted another of Pete's kind.  They're so small and so fucking fast, its hard to spot them most of the time.  We went and fed that one for a while, too.  It's hard to feed the little ones because all the other squirrels and the ducks and the crows and the seagulls are all crowded around, squabbling for a nut.  Luckily, the smaller ones are pretty fiesty and have no qualms about charging and attacking the other animals.  Finally, I chased off most of the other wildlife and it was just me, Al, and the little one for a spell.  I took about 10 of what I hope to be really good photos of him.  He was sitting perfectly, and he was only about an arm's length away.  We'll see how they turn out.  
Al and I went back to the hostel and by the time we got in it was around 7 or so, I think.  He bought beer, but I was feeling sick and thought it a bad idea to drink any.  He looked a little disappointed, I think.  Oh well.  We talked for a bit, then we tried to watch Harry Potter and The Goblet Of Fire on his laptop.  It was kinda crappy quality and the sound kept cutting in and out.  Eventually I got frustrated with it, and turned it off.  Al thought I was mad at him again.  I made a couple comments about the way he was laying and how it was pushing the mattress farther and farther from the headboard.  I think he took it to be a little more harsh than I intended.  We talked for a bit about it, and I told him that I wasn't mad at him, and I'm sorry if my tone was edgy.  
Finally the conversation got steered to the inevitable: whether or not Al and I were still together when he got on the plane.  We agreed that it was the best relationship we've ever been in, and that we weren't ready or willing to end it.  I told him how great its been hanging out with him over the past few months.  He told me that he was going to miss me (he's never out and said it before, so it really touched me) and that he had alot of fun with me, too.  He also said that he was originally going to leave Victoia in September to do his tour of Seattle, Portland and Eugene, then he was going to fly back to Australia for early October.  He stayed all that extra time because of me.  He said he had so much fun being with me that he changed his flight schedule and stayed an extra two months!  I couldn't believe it!  I mean, I can, but wow!!  He's done more nice things for me in three months than I'm used to getting in three years, and now I find out he stayed longer because of me!!  Fuckin' A!  We curled up and watched X-Files together, and I started to get sleepy.  I wanted to stay awake because I knew I wouldn't get to share a bed with him again for some time.  But eventually sleep won me over, but I remember him cuddling me nice and tight as I went to sleep.
We woke up at 8:50 the next morning.  I will always remember that morning.  We stayed in bed and talked and cuddled and tried not to cry.  Time went by so fast, and Al commented that it just isn't fair that the time we've had together went by so quickly.  I commented that the time away always goes by unnaturally slow.  That's the way it goes, though, I guess.  At just before 11, I dragged my butt out of bed and went for a quick shower.  I got back into the room and Al wasn't there.  When he walked in, I noticed that his eyes were red.  I asked if he'd been crying.  He said no, and we both knew that was a bad lie.  I got dressed and organized my things and we were getting ready to leave when Al grabbed me and held me in a tight bear hug.  I started crying even though I promised myself I would be strong and not cry.  He started crying, but in the silent way men have.  We headed out and the whole way there we were as close to each other as physics would allow.  As we got closer to the airport, I started crying more and more.  I cried silently, too.  It wasn't the kind of sad that you really cry for.  Its more of a quiet sadness that aches deep inside my heart, so I cried in a quiet way.  Al shed some more tears, as well.  It was heartbreaking to see the look on his face.  The way his brow wrinkled in the perfect image of sorrow.  The way the moisture from his tears made his woeful eyes stand out all the more.  The slight but irresistable pout on his soft, full lips.  God, he was the epitome of sadness.  It completely broke my heart to see him that way.  
At the airport, he checked in and the Air Canada lady was nice enough to not tag his bags and let him wander around a bit more before going through customs.  Al bought me a banana split for lunch, and he got himself some brownies and some chocolate milk from the 7-11 downstairs.  We sat and talked and he took a couple of photos of me while I was eating my sundae.  He said he might as well start the roll of film off on a good note.  I started crying again, he started crying again.  It was so sad.  It got near to the time we both dreaded, and I walked him back to the place he had to check in.  He told me he wanted to say goodbye before he went through, and I told him to go to hell.  I was going to go as far as they would let me before I said goodbye.  And for the record, its not goodbye, its see you later.  So we went through and checked his bags together.  That was about as far as I could go.  Apparently in Australia you can go the whole way, through customs, and into the waiting area, with your friend, mother, partner, whatever.  But here I could go no further than where he entered to go through customs.  We were griping about how unfair that was.  We stood there together, neither one wanting to walk away.  He told me that I had to be the one to walk away.  I started crying again, and told him I couldn't.  We stood there wrapped in each other's arms, crying and kissing for the better part of five minutes or so.  At last, we both stood tall and turned away at the same time.  As I was leaving, I caught a glimpse of him talking to a customs guy, and he waved, and I waved back, and then he was lost to my sight behind a row of Air Canada desks.  That was the last time I saw my baby.  It started snowing just as I left the airport to go to the bus stop.  It made me happy because I knew he wanted some snow.  
He slipped me $80 while we were at the airport as well.  I told him not to, that he really ought to keep his money, but he looked like he was going to start crying again as he told me that he worried about me and if he could give me more, he would.  So I took it only so I didn't hurt him.  With that money, I got back to Victoria and paid for a couple nights at the hostel.  I missed the 3 o'clock boat, and had to wait to catch the 5.  On the bus to the ferry, I kept myself together fairly well.  I listened to my music and tried not to think of anything.  The ferry ride went by slowly.  I zoned out the world.  The bus ride back to town was bad, though.  I couldn't stave off thoughts of Al any longer.  I cried a bit on the bus, and managed to pull myself back together.  I haven't cried since.  But it's not over.  I have many tears to shed before I am over this.  
My roommates at the hostel are as follows: a hippie, organic loving girl from California.  A strange freaky guy from I don't know and don't care where.  And a cracked out girl from the streets.  Last night I was so tired I just wanted to sleep.  I crawled into bed only to be awoken by the sound of the crack girl flailing out on freakboy.  Freakboy had apparenly touched crackgirl and crackgirl bit freakboy's ear.  I yelled at them both to shut the fuck up because some of us were normal people who had jobs to go to in the morning.  Sometime later Andy, the manager of the hostel (and a young arrogant prick, too, might I add) opened the door to the dorm and was talking really loudly.  And then at some other point during the early morning, I got my sleep disturbed again.  So today I am freezing cold, really tired, and grumpy with the utter lack of common courtesy some people have.  If its 5 in the morning, don't turn on the fucking lights and start organizing all your shit.  Fucking freakboy!!  And its a woman's dorm, too.  I wouldn't mind otherwise, but this guy gets my goat.  He's always skulking around like a kicked dog, and he just strikes me as creepy.  Oh well.  I'll deal.  
I put up a photo of Al right beside my pillow so I can still see his face when I go to sleep and when I wake up.  Cheesy, I know, but I really love him and I really fucking miss that kid.  He nicknamed me Skids, by the way.  I farted when we were on the beach and he commented about leaving skidmarks.  The name stuck.  He calls me Skids when he's teasing me and I call him Roxy when I'm teasing him.  I wrote a postcard to Al last night.  He gave me one to write and told me to mail that one and the one he had already written to his mother.  I'm going to do that today.  
Have to go to work.  Gotta make the money to get my ass out of here.  I don't know when I'll be able to go to San Fran.  I think I'm going to stay in Victoria until I'm ready to go, then I'll go from here to San Fran, then to Saskatoon.  That sounds like the best idea to me.  
Anyhow I hope everyone is well, and I will talk to you all soon!!"

"event","Well today at work sucked ass.  Nothing all day!!  Fuck!!  Oh well... I'm just going to stay on until I get something.  I don't care.  It's not like I have anything better to do.  I went and picked up the three rolls of film earlier today.  Cost me way too much!  But they were worth it, I suppose.  There's some really bad photos of me and some really good photos of Al.  And most of the photos were of squirrels.  My God!  We took alot of pictures of those little fuzz balls!!  Some good shots, though, some of them.  I got back to the hostel about half an hour ago, and I tried phoning Al long distance.  His sister, Michelle, answered and said he was still asleep.  Poor guy, he had a long fucking trip!  Just over 31 hours, all told.  That would kill me.  I'll find out soon enough, won't I?  His sister's accent is much thicker than his and I found it much more difficult to understand her.  And I always thought Al's accent was moderately thick!  Bah!  I called my dad last night for the first time in a few months.  My dad's cool.  He never really gets his knickers in a knot if he doesn't hear from me.  I like that about him.  We shot the shit for about half an hour, then rung off.  I'm going to call him again next weekend, I think.  I should ring my friend Daniel in Toronto tonight, as well.  He'll be wanting to check in on me after Al leaving.  Daniel is my best friend for many resons, one of which being that he's always so intuitive with my emotions.  He always seems to know how to identify things and in what manner to be there for me.  He's a rare gem, he is.  I think I'm going to miss him more than anybody else.  Friends usually hold a place in a person's heart that family just can't quite reach.  Unless you have an exceptional family, that is.  Which I don't.  Anyhow, I should go take a crap and try to kill a few hours before I try ringing Al again.  Oh, I miss him so much!!  At least now I have some decent photos of him to look at when I get lonely."

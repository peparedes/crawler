I walked up to the house,and was talkin to his sister for a bit,and i guess he seen me walk up to the house,and bam i was caught talkin shit about him and how he treats me. So then we walk out to my car and i try to leave again..And seriously me and him both held onto my purse for about 10 mins,and then he tackled me down to the ground in a short skirt,and i managed to get up.and then my shoe fell off,so he threw it in the neighbors yard..O I WAS SO PIST,so i went and got it,and by the tim ei got back he tried to throw a fuckin huge ass rock through my car window..I WAS LIKE DO IT!Fuckin do it,and ill throw ur ass in JAIL! Then his sister saw it ,and came out trippin,and told him she'd call the fuckin cops, and he put it down.And i just kept sayin ""ur fuckin up just let me leave"". Then hes like so i guess ill never talk to u aagain,and then he was like fuck you whore..lol..and let me tell u not 5 minutes later is this bitch blowin up my cell.lol..r u crazy..im like just leave me along for a couple hrs,until ur sober...Called back half hr later again,then another half hr,then couple hrs,and then i was ok by then. I went over there,and had dinner with his family. I shouldnt have went back over but i did bc im stupid.

I swear everyone kept callin today i could barely sit down to wipe my ass if i wanted to.lol.ANyways i hung out with Seth again today.Ok wait ive been hanging out with him everyday sincei met him.Wow i usually get sick of ppl by then.But I like him alot. I made him kind of mad tho,bc i couldnt stay the nite.I mean sorry what can i do?I guess i can go back to Mason and be depressed. Then we kinda argued for a minute,but when he was walkin me back out to my car i started to cry bc i was sad. I made him feel bad, which really weren't my intentions.I mean we had a really good nite,then it kinda blew up.We were like sitting their talking about moving out,and before you know it, were like arguing.BUt things are ok were goin to go do something tomorrow.Well i am off tobed.Cya"

"event","I bet the subject draws you in to what i am about to write about.Well alot has been going on.So let me start at the begining.Lindsay gave out an application to her friend Seth, and well he stopped in the other day to set up an interview. And i walked in the room and Lins is like ""Seth wants to take you out on a date""..lol im like ""really?""...and hes like ""yeah sure"".So he asked for my number and stuff,and i gave it to him. He ended up callin me later on that nite, and was like want to come to ashley's and hang out.Ok not really,but i did.I didnt stay long but it was cool.Then before i left,i was like my friend is having a party this weekend,and asked if he wanted to go whatever,and that he could stay the nite cuz best believe i wasnt driving home. He came to the party with me,which was cool,except for the part where lauri got really sick,and it sucked,and i didnt drink. But still i got to know him,and stuff.Yeah we got to know each other till about 5am the next morning.LoL.He's not one of those people you try to figure out and i dont know why. We hung out Saturday nite too,and you want to know how small of a world it is,his brother  did the roof on my house.lol small i know.Ne ways hes really cool,i definitely like him,but we'll see."

"event","Today was absolutely BORING! It was one of my depressing days.Work wasnt bad tho. Me and Ashley got along which is good,and were going to talk on Sunday just about some shit thats bugging me. After I got out of work,I called Lauri and i was like ""you been acting super funny lately"" and shes like ""why do u say that"",and we sat their and laughed for like a whole 5 mins,bc she didnt kno what was goin on,and I didnt.Ne ways I was like ""hey i dont want to be rude but like ive needed  to talk to u,and each time i call u ur off not listening,or talkin to ppl in the other background,and thats really RUDE!And shes like ""im soo sorry ive had my head up my ass lately,and u kno duane said the same thing about me"".Then shes like what do u have to tell me,and im like uhh oh its been so long i forgot..lol.I told her what i had to tell her,and yeah it was neat.She told me how she was talkin to duane and Jeramie was over,and she was like ""tell him thanks for the condoms he gave me bc i used them"". and he hung up on her ass.lol.

BUt Ok really I have to find someone to go with me to this lil flip concert!I hope my friend Elisabeth can go bc that will be the shit.

I might go out to Jackson tomorrow bc my friend Evan is throwing a party for his friend Dusty.So yeah.Dusty keeps asking Lauri if i like evan blah blah.I dont even kno who i like?Ive been treated so shitty i trust like no one. I do know that i have tons of feelings for brian buts thats goin NO WHERE.

O yeah today i was like terrified to go to work!Bc i thought aladrienne would send her damn mom up to my work to start sumthing or one of her cousins,uh if she even thinks of doing that good luck ill let u kno how it works out.Im goin to UPS her shit to her work,well maybe not her curler,and straightner she left with me bc uh gas money?!

"event","O wow my weekend. Whatever happened at the hotel party stays at the hotel party. I got a wee bit tipsy at this party. These guys kept following me and lauri around. I was on the phone by the window in the hotel, and lauri was passed out, and then she jumped up and went out and i ran after her bc i didnt want to be surrounded by all these guys i didnt know..so when i was trying to leave the room this guy close the door behind him as he was entering and was like ""where r u going, stay here with us"", then this other guy in the corner grabbed me tryin to get me to stay in the room. I have never had ne fear in me before bc i was by myself with 4 total strangers. BUt i got out of the room, and sat out in the hallway by myself, and called Evan, and him and dusty came to pick me and lauri up from the party. Then i tried to call Brian so he'd stay on the phone with me while evan was on his way,but of course hes mad at me,and i guess thats how mad he was at me not to try to talk to me.I didnt get to bed till like 730am sunday morning,ok that wasnt cool at all.I got over bein mad at lauri for the whole ditching thing bc well I would of done the same thing for something i can mention. 

Aladrienne called me sunday afternoon to hang out,which really i didnt have much fun bc i was really sick.Like my stomach hurt and i kept puking. I didnt have a headache tho. I really didnt drink that much. I even told my friend Andrew that, but then he wanted to know what was in my jello shots and i was like ""i dont kno"".lol.Great im paranoid about not leavin my drink unattended but ill drink something someone gives me and not watch them make it thats cool idea?

O work was really awesome? I swear ok everyone thinks im immatured and a baby? I told lindsay how ashley cussed me out,and shes like well erica i think ur car would make if u went.Ugh its like ok first off i dont pay for shit on that car, and second how easily we forget i let u take my fucken car to go get curtis stupid ass one day with my car, and I see ashley has lindsay trained bc you know what..ok lindsay who stuck up for you when everything went down with samantha and ashley?Not I? I wrote ashley this letter but i dont think im goin to give it to her..im just goin to flat out tell her to never fuckin talk to me like that again bc the next time im goin to tell her to go fuck her self and that will be the end of that

I dont even kno why I deal with this petty shit, Ive been there for everyone of those girls.I keep my mouth shut everytime one talks shit about another (ive learned my lesson).Its insane bc now they go against me.Whatever grow up."

"event","Well its a lovely Saturday morning. Not really but anyways Im currently visiting at my moms. Not alot of fun bc I really hate being here. I'm waiting for my sister to call so we can go do something like get in trouble or do drugs.Since thats what certain individuals think. Thursday we got our tickets to the lil flip concert, and her mom tried to make her sell her tickets all bc she was home an hour late. Come on now its your summer, and you have to be home by 8, if my mom ever pulled that shit we'd be having sum serious issues at stake. Anyways I've had a really rough week, the credit union made me bounce like 4 checks bc the cashed a $10 for $110,and made my account all screwed up,and took $90 from my savings,and took their sweet ass time putting it back.Then Lauri blew me off friday,and when she called i could tell she had been drinking just by the way she was talkin,so i was like ok whatever.What else oh the whole ticket incident with aladrienne. O yeah then this guy i met where leslie's husband works thought i was pretty whatever whatever so i gave him my #, and he was pretty cool,and shit, until i told him this story about Lauri,and he told the whole entire place where he worked. I was kinda like ok first off I really didnt think it was sumthing to go tell, but it really pist me off, and Lauri got mad, but I cant blame her,but she kinda did some incidents like that to me,but that was ok bc she was drunk? When she told me I was like ok first off ""why do u care what ppl think""? But ne ways when he called me I let her answer my phone, and that was the end of that.Not a big deal. NE how I want to leave, so i called my dad up and i was like yeah I think you should let come stay with you because im goin batty, and i was bout in tears. Then to make it worse I called Ashley to see if she would drive me half way bc i want to stop putting miles on my car,and she came off as the biggest bitch, I dont even consider that bitch a friend. She treats me like shit everyday at work,and I really like to flat out tell her to fuck off.Well I need to get going now, and get around for the day!Bye Bye"

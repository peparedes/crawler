"event","Woah! It's been ages sence I have written last! -points to date- Well, to tell you the truth, I did forget to write for a while, but the reason was I lost my journal. See, I packed up all the stuff from my neoroom, and was moving to my own jelly room! So it got lost in storgae. When I was pestered by a friend, who always writes in her journal, I deicded to look for it. How was I supposed to know that it would take so long! Then after I found it, I had made a huge mess. So Jenn made me clean it up. So finally I have written, and I can't think of much to say. Well, when I do, I'll get back to you. Untill then I think I'm going to play with my newest little sister, Peanut. Aw, she is the cutest little thing you could ever see."

"event","We've checked into the neolodge today, Jenn said she won't be able to see us for 5 days. I'm sad now, I'll miss her a lot, I hope these days fly by. As for my staying in the lodge I'm leaving my journal home. I don't even have any books to read while in the neolodge, hopefully it won't be too sad."

"event","Jenn got me millions of books, I'm reading them as fast as I possibly can. They are still interesting, but I'm hiding some so that Jenn won't make me read them. If their boring, it will take me more time then the more interesting ones. I feel really inquisitive and smart! No matter how many books I read, Jenn still loves me. Mom still loves me. I am so excited about all these books! Got to go read! Write tomorrow!"

"event","Oh, happy I am today! -sings- Ah, how rude of me to be happy when Jenn is sick. I am only so happy because this has been a great day for me! Besides the fact Jenn is feeling terrible, she still plays with me and my brothers a lot! She's buying me books too, I think she ran out up her nps though. Silly Jenn. I am starting to think of everything like a family. I am getting closer and more like a family that a Lenny, most likely wouldn't be welcomed in. Oh, don't I feel special. I feel like a new Lenny. Wow, I really like my family! Okay, sorry I'm a bit hyper. Maybe even physco, eh? Well anyhoo I am going to go play with my brothers, they're having a pillow fight!"

"event","Oh goodness, -rubs tummy- I had a good weekend. Jenn had to leave for the weekend, so me, Zach, and Griff stayed at the motel, they took great care of us. I had plenty to eat, and when we arrived home, Jenn let us eat lots of candy! I read lots of books while Jenn was gone. She is so proud. Zach and Griff didn't leave me out, I think Jenn talked to them about it. Anyhoo, I am feeling very good. I still hope for a friend, maybe to fly with. Well, today is going to be sad, Jenn is quite sick, so me and my brothers are going to make her soup :) Okay, well I'll be off than, bye."

"event","Today we went to Mystery Island, and Jenn let me, Zach and Griff stay alone! How fun it would be, at least, I thought. It was nothing fun at all. Zach and Griff were unseperatable. I was left alone. I flew to the shops, as Jenn gave me nps to spend, but it wasn't fun alone. The tambola didn't even give me a booby prize today. I mean, how much worse can it get? I was so sad and lonely. I miss my brothers and sisters, even if they were just fosters. Humf, I wish Jenn would have another pet, so we could partner up and be friends :( Eh, got to clean my room, Jenn has visitors over soon. I'll write later!"

"event","Aviary is pink. Like my feathers. -blush- pink is a pretty color. I am the only pink neopet in my S.A.A.P Club. Anyhoo, I got Aviary now. Who is she? My pet miamouse, duh! I was given it as a gift from Jenn. I hope she doesn't spoil me just because she'll think I'll like her more. I don't think that't very nice. Do you? Well, I do like her more because of it. Is that mean? I'm not trying to be, it's just I do. Can I help my feelings? Me and my brother, griffeyphan connected today. Jenn is trying to find me books, and while I was reading, Zach took one to hide. How rude! Anyhoo, griffeyphan got it back and gave it to me. How nice! I said thank you, and than we started to talk. For a little thing, he's really qute educated. Well, I'm going to go check out my gallery, I hope to have visitors soon! Good day."

"event","My family is very, very new. I would have to say I would chose to know them all better, but life here is different. I am not sure if it's bad, or if it isn't ,but I can see myself being a part of the family. Zach, my brother is obsessed with battling, now it would be fine, except for battling is quite scary, therefore Zach scares me. The other day someone bumped into me, and told me to watch out very rudley, and Zach stood up for me. I didn't want him to. I don't like yelling or fighting. This was is terrible. I just wish it would be over. I hate it when Zach comes home with wounds and scars from his battle. Griffeyphan is rather childish at sight, he is my baby brother. He is very smart for his age, and her looks up to Zach as to be a good battler someday. For some reason, I wish he would look up to me. Jenn is rather jumpy, too hyper. I like happy, but too happy can really throw me threw a loop. They're are some things I rather enjoy, like my own gallery, my pink gallery, like the color of my feathers. I still get to go to my S.A.A.P (Society Against the Abusing of Pets) meetings. My brothers simply frown upon my knack for this club. Which reminds me of my short temeper. I don't dare raise my voice to any of them, afraid of the affects, to me. I like to fly, and odd as it is, I have no friend to fly with. None of my siblings can fly, and surley not Jenn. I sight at the lonleyness of my species. I must be off to pick out items for my new room in Jenn's faerie neohome. I find it most comferting that Jenn said she would make my room in the 2nd floor, so I can fly to my room. Who needs stairs?"

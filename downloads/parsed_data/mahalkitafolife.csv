"event","Well, let's analyze the subject a second, cliques---A small exclusive group of friends or associates...they are your crew, crowd, your family away from your family, and the term i've grown up with---BARKADA--the people you hang out with.

so what brings me to this discussion of cliques is that lately, wherever i go, most notably at school...my peers tend to form these factions...maybe it's always been this way, and i just never noticed it, but it's there, and it has been set before my attention..Don't get me wrong, i HAVE friends, all kinds of friends, but it has occurred to me recently that I lack the core group that many of my friends have....how?...well the answer is simple, i've never had one...ever...it never occurred to me that i needed a ""group"" to call my own....ever since i was little i was content in being friends with everyone--some deeper than others, but friendships nonetheless....all i needed was my best friend to have a sense of solidity in my life....

these thoughts surfaced during my disneyland trip...last year, it was easy to see who would be in my ride group...but this year it was much more difficult...the groups this year were all uneven....and following a number of incidents on the trip, i found myself walking on mainstreet alone...sad to be in the happiest place on earth all by yourself...

these cliques hang out not only at school, but OUTSIDE of school, they go to the movies, shopping, theme park trips, etc....they know each other beyond school...and that is how they're able to build deeper friendships in high school....i got a taste of this when i was invited to a movie nite with one of these famous cliques....the catch?...i had to drive....yes, i was the chaffeur for the night..picking people up, driving them home, and for what???....so i could gain some points with this barkada? that's not me at all...what's going on with me?

I guess it comes down to this....even with 1200 students, high school can be a lonely place...the weekends can be a lot lonlier"

"event","Let's see....2004 was to say the least, a pretty tough year....So, I am happy to say that I'm glad it's over. It brought so much pain and drama, I really wasn't equipped to deal with it all. Some friendships i thought were  solid, diminished. I'm really not quite sure if they were genuine in the first place. Too many funerals this year too. I can't or won't forget the people i lost this past year. Still pains me every night. I cry thinking about those who i am close to losing; who slip through the cracks; who, become erased.  

So in 2005, I'm ready for a fresh start. No more drama pleeeze. Incredibly tired of it. All I want to do is be well---me. I want to be the me I was at my highest point in life. When I was always surrounded by people I loved and who loved me in return everyday. Not just fucked up posers who say they love you or they'll be there for you and aren't when life gets fucked up. No, no those people need not be in my life any longer. 

Good Luck in 2005 everyone....i know i'll need it"

"event","man...so yesterday i said goodbye to Aubrey...she's going off to Loyola in new orleans....her flight leaves tomorrow..she's gonna call me before she gets on the plane...but yeah..last nite she sang for the last time in a choral setting..well at least until she comes back...which is highly doubtful seeing as how her parents are movin outta LA....JB gave her a shitload of solos...including one of my favorites yes we believe....oh man..and then he gave us a duet on this song..here i am...and the words were like 

""here i am, standing right beside you, here i am, do not be afraid, here i am, waiting like a lover, i am here, here i am"" 

bitch started to tear up in the middle...made me tear up too...well i guess that was pretty much our real goodbye...other than the 20 hugs and pool of tears cried afterwards....she is my big sister..and that'll never change, even if she never comes back"

I showed up at the church for the funeral service, i greeted sara, joyce's long time partner, and basically my other voice teacher....we held each other....for a very long time...it seemed like if we let go:
JOYCE WOULD REALLY BE GONE....and it was almost like we both couldn't even bear that thought

Unlike most people...i was accompanied by a few friends, among them being eileen, tatiana, omar, and t
i had a lump in my throat the whole time....omar held back his tears too...but t just couldn't help it...she let it go
i didnt cry....until sara spoke....hit home real bad....
""she's given each of you a gift, and only you know what she's given you""

how can i keep from singing?????
i find myself absentmindedly singing songs she taught me, everything from disney tunes to maxwell house commercial songs...it's crazy

i'll never keep from singing...especially for joyce

joyce was one of the most beautiful people i've ever met and probably will ever know...i probably wasn't one of her better students vocally but she made me feel like i was...she always made sure i was in a dress and was made up for every concert, recital, or performance....before i met her i was strictly hip hop, r&b, and pop...she showed me the beauty in classical, musicals, showtunes...and all different kinds of genres...she loved me unconditionally............joyce, i will miss you...and i love you from the bottom of my heart...

so tomorrow's the funeral...christine, omar, and many other choir friends will be there....we'll get thru it together...peace out"

okay so after i lost the bid the tickets and lost my trip to san diego...the day just kept spiraling down an endless pit....

we went to my favorite restaurant...(Rainforest Cafe)...i was so excited...(maybe this mite be relief to an already bad day) i bought this membership to the restaurant ($10)..the day was lightening up...but no....it was brought down again by my mother's unfailing ways of kicking me when i am down......yes...i couldn't even have a good time at my favorite restaurant..nope

i prayed to God to send me some sort of sign that i'd be okay...and right then my ""2nd mom"" Shari called me.....OMG it was a freaking miracle.....all she wanted to tell me was that the name of this guy from our church finally clicked in her head...and she had to tell me right away...it was definitely a DIVINE INTERVENTION

soooo i talked to her about wat was goin on...and she reassurred me that i'd be okay....just to slow down and what not.....the day had finally seemed to be gettin brighter

it was pretty much moderate from then on....except for a few clouds (i.e. reebok was closed, and i come home to a house that has no running water)...but i did meet KAREEM RUSH!...
he was at the rest stop...poor guy only has puti friends....o well i got a hug...and he signed my basketball shoe....yay!"

so for the last time i say goodbye to those who made me angry and bitter:
GOODBYE TO YOU....GOODBYE TO EVERYTHING THAT I KNEW
YOU WERE THE ONE I LOVED...THE ONE THING THAT I TRIED TO HOLD ON TO

that chapter is over, and so i start anew"

"event","i can finally get some rest...i think...well starting monday...haha...i got my wish wen i said i didnt want to sit on my ass all summer...im handling a job, babysitting duties, tutoring (yes, i'm doin the tutoring), basketball (soon, soon), asb meetings, and on top o everything i must plan two weeks of fun for my dad's daughter who's flying in on july 2nd

well u might be thinking ""dad's daughter?"" doesn't that mean she's ur sister?...technically, she's my ""half-sister"" but of course as most of you who know me know... to me it takes more to be a sister than blood or dna....in my case...blood is not thicker than water...the title of ""sister"" is an intimate thing that entails actually having a relationship & a ""sisterly"" connection with another female and even more so with the title ""big sister""...this title implies protection--someone not only to share an intimate connection but also to take care of me and watch my back...i've got people to cover the ""big sister"" role already (i.e. theresa, aubrey)...so i can honestly say b/c i dont even know this person.....she is my----""dad's daughter""...


AM I WRONG???????
COMMENT PLEASE."

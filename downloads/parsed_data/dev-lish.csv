"event","he went to indiana for a company meeting just over a month ago and met a woman his age that works in the corporate office. oh they hit it off quite well. she is the total opposite of me. the motherly type. the prissy type. very girlie. they talked over the phone and he went back there for another company meeting. he stayed in her apartment for the majority of the time while he was there. they were getting along famously. 

then she flew out here with her son. this is what i heard. her son is a whiney little baby. she was cold and unconversational. she didn't like his house. she didn't like his car. she sat at the beach wrapped in a towel and wouldn't go near the ocean. apparently she was 'out of her element.' i think she came here thinking 'beach, owns a house, classic car' and expected money. HAHAHA fucking cunt.

i feel bad for him because i know how it is. they talked semi-serioulsy about a lot of things and made preimptive plans. 

we've talked a little since this. he wants me to move back to the area to be closer to everything. he asks me in a playful tone 'why'd you have to be an ass' and 'you really piss me off sometimes' i know. you do the same to me. i know i'm for him. i would lose some very good friendships if i go back to him. our daughter would have a family. should i just do it and grow up? i think i really might."

"event","this week has been very stressful. 
he decided to seek the advice of a lawyer over his rights for custody of our daughter. didn't want me to have her this weekend for fear i would up and leave. 
you think crazy thoughts when you can see absolutly nothing ahead of you. 98% of them i would never do. but they are there.
i have to move somewhere. 
the hardest part is that i had much less control of my situation than i ever had before. i had chosen to move far away. i had chosen to change careers. i didn't choose to be left alone. i didn't chose to have my job taken away. i am getting past the worst part, though.... i feel it.

so i had a wonderful weekend with my daughter. we went to the park, flea market, aquarium. we had fun. she shows off wherever we go. i don't know where she gets it. i do know that she has my temper. my parents laugh at the irony. 
my left arm is fried from driving around so much this weekend. need to go to the beach to even things out.... perhaps wed."

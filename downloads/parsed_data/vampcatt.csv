"event","WELL.. had the yard sale last weekend, barely made enough to keep the electric going!
I THINK I got everything shipped. If you are an Ebay customer and have not received your items by the 24th.. EMAIL me and I'll make sure it was mailed and check with the post office . ( I've had a couple shipments go ""MIA"" so..I'm a little concerned about that. 

Other than that.. just putting my application/resume out everywhere looking for a ""normal"" job.. so that my ebay shipments don't suffer when things get bad.. 

I STILL have not had a cigarette.. and ironically.. I've not been bitchy or ""munchy"" because of it.. I've gained one pound since I quit.. so.. .. woo!!! ( that one lb could easily be the plain olf fluctuation, or perhaps the different shoes I was wearing when I weighed!.. lol ) 

I'm taking things one day at a time and hoping that everything falls into place and life quality starts imroving even more. 
Life is pretty serene.. on all fronts EXCEPT finances of course. If I can could get just that area licked.. all would be great. 

Miss yakking with all of you.. Like I said.. I'll try to be on more after Anna and Michelle head back to Gore!
*HUGS* to all those worthy :)"

"event","Those of you that know me, know my bday is in 2 days, and I used to go ""whole hog"" on the 4th of July. 
This year, of course, we didn't have the finances to really get fireworks. We drove the neighbors to the pond in the middle of our subdivision for the festivities. A bunch of the neighbors showed up and everyone had fireworks galore. I think it was better than driving to town and watching the ""official"" fireworks display. We brought a little bbq grill, had hot dogs and such. We had a grand time.. was really fun. :) 

The outlook was a little gloomy, this morning.. but it turned out well.. :) We had a really good time.. :)"

I had a couple payments I was supposed to get last week. Payments that people SWORE would be here.. that would have gotten me OUT of the hole AND gotten all my backlogged mailing out ( SO SORRY to all my past auction people :( ) 
BUT.. since the money didnt get here.. I had 2 checks bounce on one account.. and the electric is going to be about $20.00 shy on my checking account - first thing monday morning.. SO.. I'm totally screwed. I emailed all my auction people.. but.. man.. its been over a month for some of them.. Some have been MORE than understanding.. and some.. I'm SURE have their fingers poised over the negative feedback button. 

send good luck vibes my way everyone.. It wouldlnt take a whole lot of money to get me back and running again.. but MAN.. this really sucks.. :("

"event","I want to start off by thanking the 2 people that have helped with donations.. I really appreciate it. I am going to place the donation button at the end of this post too, as I still need help. 

Where to begin... Everything is still a blur. Tuesday morning.. I was going to take Vishy down to Carter to have Carter show me how to express the bladder. It was still looming in the back of my head that this isnt the same urinary tract infection that we've dealt with before, because his urine was clear.. not cloudy or bloody, as it had been in previous bouts with infection. I was concerned that with 400 cc's of subcutaneous fluid in him.. his bladder would be reaching its max.  I realized that Carter.. though a ""decent"" vet.. doesnt have a lab or the technology I needed to really figure out what was going on with Vishy. So.. I bit the bullet and took him to Johnson. (long story.. only one of you knows why thats an issue) . Anyhoo.. Johnson is a good vet.. with the exception of one area, in which I wasnt going to deal with anyhoo. 

I took Vish to Johnson and ran a series of tests on him. My poor baby was still as weak and lethargic as ever. And still hadn't Meowed or purred in days. (And those of you that knew my Vishy.. know that he was a TALKER.. <slight smile>. So.. Test results. his BUN reading was so high off the charts.. the machine just returned it with xxx. his Creatin level.. was 17.00 (supposed to be in a range of 0.30 - 1.30) glucose was high.. potassium high and calcium low. End results : Kidney Failure. Johnson said that he was 90% sure that it was Anti-freeze. (of course.. Johnson didn't know about Vishy's past Urinary problems.) Had I been a millionaire.. and could have a jet to fly me to a real state twice a week for dialysis, or spend $3000 to have someone do something about this??.. I might have been able to save him. But.. Johnson.. one of the ""higher tech"" vets we have in the area (has a nice clinic actually) didn't think that anyone in this state even offered dialysis for animals. If it had been an option.. I would have done anything in my power to work it out.. (Of course.. had I been a millionaire.. we wouldn't have lost Uncle Tom a few weeks ago either.. we still think that had they been able to take him to a cancer specialist in Texas.. he'd have had a fighting chance) Johnson told me that he didn't think that Vish would last throughout the day, with his levels being what they were. BUT that since his levels were so high.. that he was feeling no pain, and could spend the rest of his hours with his loved ones. So.. bawling and beyond numb.. I brought Vishy home.. 
""B"" and I were laying with Vishy.. and at one point while ""B"" was holding him.. he actually purred a little. ""B"" and I were of course were complete wrecks.. nothing worse than sitting there with your beloved baby and just ""waiting"" for them to die.. it was beyond heart wrenching.. Poor baby Vish was holding on.. but I can't believe he wasnt suffering at all.. I think Vets say that.. but our babies don't show their pain.. 
At one point Vishy let out a sad yowl that I've never heard him do before EVER. ""B"" and I were instantly panicked.. but he seemed alright after that.. we cuddled up with Vishy and started to nod off (we hadn't slept more than a couple hours in the last 3 or 4 days I think) and we both were startled awake by another heart wrenching yowl. SO that was it.. I didn't want my baby to suffer.. ""B' couldnt bring himself to take Vishy down.. we kept hoping that some miracle woudl happen and he'd ""snap out of it"" so I called Doc Carter and took Vishy down there. I was talking to Carter telling him how (OK I had to fib.. you don't tell one vet that you decided he wasnt good enough and took your pet to another vet) Johnson had run tests.. Carter was all "" you took him to Johnson!?!?"" to which I fibbed and said that we had run into town really quick and that our cousin came over..and saw how bad Vish was took Vish to Johnson.. bad lie.. but I don't want to piss off hte vet that is taking care of my babies... ya know? Anyhoo.. I told him about the test and how Johnson said ""Anti-freeze"" and Carter said "" Bullshit!!"" (as he was about to inject Vishy.) so.. pushed his hand away and said WAIT.. what do you mean.. Bullshit!.. (tiny glimmer of hope in my broken heart) and then he just explained that he thought it was bullshit that Johnson assumed antifreeze when there were no tests for antifreeze per se.. that the same symptoms can come from other things.. that it wasnt necesarily Antifreeze. OK.. I see I am rambling here.. Carter agreed that with the Kidney damage and the Creatin and BUN levels SO high.. that there was nothing that could be done to save Vishy..  :( So.. I had to resign myself to not let Vishy suffer any longer and ease his pain. It was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do in my life.  Vishy was a special kitty.. he was a character.. and TALKAtive.. man.. he'd carry on entire conversations with ya.  I came home and ""B"" had already dug a grave next to Meowsers and LB :( so we buried our third baby in one weekend. 

Meowsers was 9 years old.. and was Vishy's Aunt. Vish was 8 yrs old, LB was 5.. LB wandered on their propery 5 years ago and worked his way into everyones hearts.. so was the youngest of the family. 

All the while this was all happening.. I've been trying to keep half a brain cell dedicated to finances. I called the bank to check on our accounts.. and there was some funky charge for $25.00 to ""B"";s account.. and we dont use his account for much other than major bills.. My account is the one we use for smaller purchases and is usually the account that in lean times.. might bounce if the pennies don't line up correctly. SO.. because of this bogus charge.. the $21.80 water bill bounced.. We talked to the bank.. she said she'd dispute the $25.00 charge that we had no knowledge of.. and make the water bill go through. We didnt make it down there yesterday, as we were burying Vish about the time the bank was closing I think.  SO.. long story short ( too long I know) his account is currently $94.00 NEGATIVE.. and mine is down to $20.00 ( and thats with transferring $70.00 and $20.00 today from ebay sales!.. We have the phone bill disconnect on Friday $70.00 
SO.. here I am.. $120.00 in one visit for Johnson fees. $160.00 for Carter (4 visits ! ) and the phone of $71.00 (its 70.77 or something)  NOT to mention that I am backlogged on my shipping.. When Uncle Tom was sent home to die.. after the hospital told him "" oh.. you have been battling cancer for 9 months, and now you're Cancer free.... "" then 4 days later said "" Oops.. no.. yer not cancer free.. and you have inoperable liver damage.. and because you have cancer.. you cant have a transplant.. so.. you can just go home"" and He went home to just wait to Die ( sorry.. still a little bitter on that one- sorry for the mini rant) We were driving up to visit Uncle Tom as much as possible.. as we knew  it was the last times we'd get to see him. SO.. I wasnt home to make items and get them on ebay.. and all the money coming in.. went to gas to get up there.. and animal food/our food. SO I am behind on my shipping.. probably on the verge of getting a bunch of negative feedbacks from people that want their items. Everytime I get close to getting everything mailed off.. we have a death here :( 

OH.. and I forgot to mention that I confronted the Neighbor ( that threatened my cats lives 2 years ago when he moved in here.. long story about that one.. he thought he had the ""right to shoot them"" if they were on his property). I asked him about the Antifreeze.. asking if he had any out anywhere etc.. and he admitted that they had added antifreeze to his wifes car about 4 days previously ( time frame fits) but then after a bit of a discussion.. where he said "" I didnt know antifreeze could hurt animals"" etc.. then he said that they used Sierra.. the environmentally friendly ( and I THINK animal ""safe""r type.. so.. I dont know.. He also lied about shooting in the backyard the other day. (we heard a shot.. ""B"" saw Tom (neighbor) in the backyard with his gun in his boxers.. Mark (different neighbor) yelled "" TOm.. you shooting my dogs?LOL"" and Tom chuckling ""Nah"" at him..  When I asked Tom what he was shooting at the other day.. he said he hadnt been out back shooting anything. and since ""B"" was the one that saw him.. not me.. I said that ""B"" SAW him in the backyard with the Gun.. and that perhaps something was getting my guineas and were shooting at it? ( a smart person would have lied with "" yah.. saw a coon gettin your guinea.. so I was shootin at it) 
His answer was "" maybe he saw Mark (tom is bald.. Mark is a biker with long hair) .. Mark walks through the property all the time looking for his dogs ""with a GUN? "" I asked? 

oh gods.. ok.. and as I post this.. ""B""s computer just shut down.. either CPU or POwer supply.. JEEEEEEEEZ when it rains it pours! 
Gotta go figure out why his computer died.. 
ANyone that can help.. PLEASE help me out of this freaking black hole I am in!

"event","Took Vishy down to Carter again to get subcutaneous(sp) water injection (he was beyond dehydrated, and has been lethargic this whole time.. not eating, drinking or anything) SO.. I go down. he expresses the bladder again. No infection or blood in the urine.. it isnt ""blockage"" that is making him not pee. Carter goes on and on about how it could be feline leuk, or FIV or a zillion other things. I try to stay optomistic that the water will get absorbed in his system, he'll perk up and eat like last time we had probs with him. I get home. Ben and I start worrying about where Lil' Bastard is.. haven't seen him a day and a half.. maybe 2 days? (been crazy.. its been a blur since Friday) 
So.. we look and look.. I come back in the house, and Ben comes in and tells me that LB is dead.. was in the flowerpot dealie outside the bedroom window ( one of his favorite places to nap). So.. we went and buries LB next to Meowsers. We're both total wrecks.. We have to check when they all had their shots.. and try to get the money together to get everyone shots. It's 2pm now, and Vish doesnt seem any better. To look at him.. you'd think he was just a sleeping kitty.. but I see that his breathing is shallow.. he does NOT purr..and he is SOOO lethargic. :( 
I don't know what we're going to do.. I can't lose THREE cats in as many days :( 
My poor babies.. I dont know what is happening, and I don't even know that its related.. they seem to have different symptoms from what I can tell. LB seemed to pass in his sleep.. up in the flowerbox, neither Meowsers or Vish would have the energy or inclination to jump up there.. so I don't think its connected. 
I am accepting all prayers, positive thoughts, donations to the vet fund and general positive vibes.. we need all of the above that we can get. :( 

Someone out there must be able to help? If I could get 10 people to donate even $20.00 each.. It would REALLY help.. if you know of anyone that might be able to help me.. then feel free to send them to my journal. I can even try to repay donations with etched glassware or something..

"event","Those of you that don't know.. After 9 months of HELL fighting Cancer.. Uncle TOm passed away a couple Fridays ago. :(   2 Funerals in One week (the other was Cindy's Dad). 

Anyhoo.. Still here in Oklahoma.. Viscious still has his unrinary infection thing.. 
Saturday.. I go to Doc Carter and tell him he needs to try to express the bladder. that I dont think its been that bad, and what does he do? He is intent on a Cathedar (sp) so he sticks Vishy with Kedamine(sp) which I DIDNT want him to do unless necessary. 
SO.. he sticks vish.. then feels his bladder.. expresses the bladder. Clean Urine.. no blood or infection.. but NOW.. he is full of kedamine. Doc Carter says "" Don't worry about it.. I dont think he'll go that far under this time"" TO which I have to think.. Is this MIRACLE tranqs? They ""sense"" that there is "" no need"" for them.. so they are just going to dissipate?! ANyhoo.. Vishy is STILL groggy and laying in the cat carrier.. not eating or anything yet. and this is MORE than 24 hours later :(  :( 

And .. TODAY.. sigh.... <wiping tears> Meowsers was very lethargic.. I mean. BAD.. she had been puking foamy puke for a couple days.. but.. thats not uncommon in this house.. they puke the ""grass puke"" up every so often. 
So.. I look at Meowsers and her inner eyelids are coming up from the corner of the eyes.. NEVER a good thing. Thats what Vishy's look like from the drugs! .. 
SO.. I call Doc Carter.. he tells me to come over before church.. I bolt over there (8:30 am) He looks at her and says "" wow she is tiny.. she much have been sick a long time and you just now are noticing"" (which I get defensive.. NO.. she is 9 years old and been this way for 9 years.. yadda yadda) 
He goes into the spiel about how I COULD do 200.00 + of tests on her and still not know what the actual cause of sickness is. etc etc. and then the LOVELY quote from rural hell "" You could do that.. but it would be foolish on ***JUST**** a cat"" <shaking head> 
Of course. he is ""holding"" our checks for his services.. so he knows that this time around I cant afford to "" do whatever it takes"" ( not that he would.. he was on his way to church.. and he would have had me come back at 3pm - we talked about that option. 

and.. cutting to the chase.. I was on my way home with Meowdy.. stopped at Pixie for gas, as I was lucky i made it there and back.. got back in the cab of the truck.. she was ""drunk"" bobbing in the cage and meowing for me like she's never meowed before.. so I open the cage and take her almost limp body out.. and she focused on my eyes one last time and then died. 

<sniff> 
I'm going back to bed now.. I'm a mess."

"event","WELL.. for those of you that know.. I went to Colorado because I had a great paying job lined up..  Heh.. well.. that fell through before I even got here.. so.. I'm looking for work.. BUT.. i have a NEW ""funny"" job under my belt.. I've worked at the carnival.. I've made BOW strings for a living, I've been a cake decorator.. and now.. 
I've MILKED COWS!!! I wrote an email to ""B"", so I'll edit out the mooshy parts and post my MILKING experience here.. 


Time is 12:57.. Thursday night.. I got off work at midnight. 
Let me TELL you what an adventure it was. The guy must have been joking with me about it being manual.. lol.. I caught on well.. the guy training me even commented that I do a good job of attaching the milkers to each teat for someone that has never done that before..lol.. 
the ADVENTURE to it all is bringing in each of the 3 groups of cows.. the first bunch are nice cows.. young. happy.. not prone to be sick or mean or kick.. the next TWO batches are all of the above.. if there is a cow with mastasomething.. then they have to be milked differently and the nozzles soaked in a bleach/antiseptic solution so it doesnt get spread to the next cow.. etc etc. 

The guy training me ( Kent is his name I think.. and I will refer to him as Kent from now on :) told me to take the flashlight and go round up the batch of cows.. he stood at the gate with me and pointed.. denoting that I should walk the perimeter and ""yah"" and ""CH-SH"" all the cows in ( thats professional terms used to make cows ""scoot"" ) anyhoo.. as I walk toward the right side of the pen.. making sure i know where the hotwire is.. i take a step and WHOOOOSH.. KNEE DEEP IN COWMANURE!
I was wearing sweats and tennis shoes in galoshes type boots. which of course became filled with manure.. I was officially christened I guess.. 
Kent was very apologetic as he chuckled a ""welcome to the dairy world"" comment. lol.. but it wasnt really that bad all in all.
of course.. I stopped at the car wash on the way home and rinsed off.. 
I got back here and the shower doesnt work upstairs.. so I had to take a very long sponge bath from the sink.. I'm clean.. but it didnt feel nice and refreshing like a shower would have.. 
I guess I did alright, since they want me back at 12:15 noonish tomorrow..

UPDATE from that.. I told them that I wouldnt be here in 2 months, and they said that they didn't want to train me, when I woudlnt be there for the long haul.. Kent will be taking 1/2 the cows to texas, and they need someone to ""run things"" while he is gone.. SO.. 
I am no longer a milker.. rofl.. but.. it was an experience."

Went to Bingo last night with Anna and Beth.. we DID NOT win.. 
the ride home was SOO much different than last week when Beth and I BOTH won. <rofl>
They have these funky little computer/laptop little things they use now in Bingo halls.. they cost a little more,and I've never used them.. BUT.. I NOW KNOW that I will NOT go to Bingo again until I can afford to play with those little machines. 
I was keeping track of the winners all night, literally 80% of the winners were on those little machines. 
We watched the lady down the table from us win OVER 6 times, and another chick on a laptop 2 tables down won 4 times, once was $1000!.. SO.. 
thats the deal.. NO MORE BINGO.. until I have the $40+ bucks to do the laptop thing! 

<grin> BUT.. .. its been a great weekend anyhoo. 
Anna has been here all weekend, and we've been having a great time. 
We certainly haven't prepared for the yard sale as much as we wanted. However, we've had such a great time visiting, it's ok :) . 
Had a fish fry the first night she was here (Erika.. tell M to use a beer batter for the crappie.. was YUMFACE! :) We've played trivial pursuit every night and just had a great time visiting. GRANTED.. we've been up until 6am almost every morning.. rofl.. so.. the sleep schedule is a BIT whacked right now. 

She goes home today though, will miss her.. she's coming back Wednesday though.. since we are having the yard sale next weekend. 

I'm hoping to get all my ""to do"" list done in the next two days so that I can focus on getting everything I OWN (practically) down to the garage.. I really AM a packrat.. 
Is there a quiz for THAT out there? rofl!

Anyhoo.. I haven't posted much in the last week.. so I thought I'd just babble a bit :)  
I might not post until after the Yard Sale.. I'll have to let you guys know how it went ( LIKE I have some huge database of readers here. I'll let all 3 of my readers know how it went) <rofl!>

Anna is making ""Indian Chili"" in the kitchen, ""B"" and I are watchign football.. 
WOOO SAINTS!!!!!!!!!! great game.. WISH we could **WATCH** the Saints..
But NO.. they televise the freaking Cowboys.. BLEH.. We have to listen to the Saints game on the computer.. but I guess.. at least we can do that.. so.. it could be worse. 

Will post later!"

I was hoping I would have heard from Erika, saying that she got home ok.. but I assume I'll see her post later today. 

ALSO.. Beth and I went to BINGO last night.. *I* won 50.00 and SHE won $113.00!!!! 
That will help with the bills.. thats for sure :) 

I am off to town right now, but I will make a nice long post later with pics :)

Uhm.. rented movies.. but it was FOOTBALL!!>. and MAN the SAINTS GAME was a NailBiter until the last second!.. <grin> all the animals thought ""B"" and I had gone insane :) 
WOOOO SAINTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Oh.. P.S. I might start doing movie rental reviews on here.. 
Monster's Ball - What the HELL? How was this some ""critically acclaimed"" movie? I called it "" Billy Bob does Halle Barry""  before I rented it, wasn't ever sure how much of a plot line it had.. Now that I've seen it.. BLEH!!.. It was horrid. Don't waste your time or moneyl. ONLY movie I have seen recently that was MORE of a flop was ""Dahmer"" ( GODS that was **THE** worst movie I've seen.. probably because I am a Serial Killer Buff.. and KNOW that they left 90% of the content out of that movie.. )

Finally.. I am logging out.. so this is brief.. Waiting for Erika to call me.. cant WAIT for her to come VISIT! :)

I was thinking.. if I can make these a little smaller, or lighter.. ( and add hair of course) do you think these would be cute for a few bucks on ebay? i.e. would YOU guys buy them? Of course.. I dont know why I am asking here.. only Erika and Jill and Beth read this.. lol..but.. in case I start posting on some community thingy.. maybe someone will post. Here is a REALLY rough start.. I made a few little faces, partially from a mold and added lots of facial features myself..

We knew he had a ""mass"" on his pancreas, but we were waiting to get the results of the biopsy from the removal to see if it was cancerous. Turned out it was, and they give him a 25% chance of survival for up to 3 years. Its Grim.. and we're all just waiting to see how he comes out of receovery. He is still in ICU.. but is speaking and will hopefully go to a non ICU room in the next day or so."

HEY.. I thought I posted yesterday about our adventure in getting the pontoon boat out of the lake and taking it to the mechanics. <lj user=""vamplestat""> and I trying to paddle a 20+ foot PONTOON boat with an oar and a broom (as a psuedo oar) is QUITE amusing.. lol..

NOW.. if they will just HATCH them.. they are still juveniles and haven't had a successful spawn yet. I didn't get to see them lay these eggs, so I dont know if the male fertilized them or not. He's guarding them closely.. and thats always a good sign. 
SO.. cross your fingers folks.. I want little baby fry swimming around in my tank in a couple days!


Got lots to do today.. tons of etching and billpaying and all kinda ""lovely"" stuff so.. I'll be around here and there.. 
Now just to wait for Lestat to get out of GAME.. sheesh.. wakes up and first thing she does is message me that she if heading in game.. <shaking head>"

SO.. its going to be a trial and error to see if we can get the environment JUST RIGHT for them to keep and hatch their eggs :)

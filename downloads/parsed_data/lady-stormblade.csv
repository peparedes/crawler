"event","I just wanted to take the time to leave a journal update, to wish everyone a merry christmas.  I haven't written in a while, but then... I haven't really had much to write about. 

For christmas dinner, I'm being non-traditional... well.. at least for what I'm used to for christmas. Normally I'm used to turkey and stuff like that... this year... I'm having lamb. I decided to give it a go. I don't know how to cook it.. so I looked up a recipie online... gonna give it a try. I don't know how it'll turn out. I'll have to let everyone know how it was... assuming it doesn't kill me. ;) 

Anyway. I hope everyone is well, and enjoying this holiday season."

"event","okay... anything new to tell all about.... *thinks hard*  mmm nope. Not really. Going to see my mum for Thanksgiving this coming Thursday. So... that should be okay.  other than that... ... I'm going to see Harry Potter on Tuesday.. maybe Wednesday with my friends. umm... I think that about covers it. I haven't been up to a lot other than reading, and working on my fanfiction story. (well, aside from trying to find a job. but, that's nothing exciting to write about) Monday I'm going to go sign up for a few paper routes... it'll at least give me a little bit of money til I find something more substantial. 

anyway... I hope everyone else is doing well. :)"

"event","Hey guys, I just wanted to do an update since it's been a couple of days... maybe a week-ish... Anyway... I haven't really had too much to do. I did have an interview on Wednesday at a pizza place just down the road though, they had some more interviews to do yesterday, so hopefully next week sometime I'll be called. Here's to hoping. It would only be 3-4 days a week between 9 or 10 AM until 5PM each day that I worked. Which would suit me just fine. ... Unfortunately no one else seems to be hiring... and if they are... they haven't called me yet for an interview.

Lets see... other than that... not too much is happening. My bedroom finally got cleaned out from all of it's old contents, of my roommate Andrea, who lived here before with her parents when she was younger. I've been here what.. nearly 2 months now? and they've finally decided to let me have a bedroom, instead of a strorage space. So, my bedroom is now almost set up all the way. Yay!! Except for, well... my closet. It still has a bunch of Andrea's stuff in it... but I'm going to work on getting that stuff out of there either tonight or tomorrow probably. Then I can unpack all of my clothes and put them away, and store my luggage in my closet, instead of still rummaging around through them trying to find things I need. Weeeeee. I'm so excited to have my own room. Later tonight I'm going to put my TV and dvd player and vcr in there, so that I can watch tv and stuff if I want to while I'm in there. 

Hmmm.... I think thats about the only note-worthy things that I've had happen this past week. Halloween was pretty much a snooze fest. Didn't do anything. Ahh well. That's alright. There's always next halloween. And next year, I do intend to dress up and do something. .. hopefully. lol 

Anyway I think that's about all for now. I hope everyone is doing well."

"event","Okay, I'm tired. Didn't sleep well today. I think I might go to bed in a few minutes. hopefully I'll sleep longer than 4 hours. 

I had chicken and steak for dinner tonight. It was yummy. ... 

I've decided that after I get a job... I'm going to get myself a new computer... maybe a lap top... ... not sure yet. I want something I can carry around with me, if I want to.  Of course I'm going to wait long enough to get my bills caught up. ... not that I'm behind on them. I just want to get as much of them paid off as I can before I spend more money. Definately, I am going to get my stupid student loan paid off finally, so I can stop worrying about that. I've had it for faaaar too long. It's time to bid it fair well. 

Anyway, I can't think of much else to say right now, due to my brain feeling a bit mushy and numb."

"event","I went over to Traverse City with my roommates yesterday. We didn't do much of anything, other than go to a couple of shops and have dinner. We went to Best Buy, and to Borders, and to a little gaming shop. My roommate John, bought the game Soul CaliburIII ... It looks fun. I love the other 2 even though I haven't played them in ages and ages. We ate at a Cajun jazz/blues bar and grill... they have good food.. but I decided to try something different last night, and ended up not being able to eat it.. for the flames that felt like they were in my mouth. Anyway...

I just got off the phone with the US Postal Service career centre. I saw the number in the news paper, saying they were hiring, and the pay ranges between $18.50 - 59.00 + per hour... at the very lowest amount that I could earn.... $18.50 an hour... thats like... $2,960 dollars a month... (if I only worked 40 hours a week...)

The last job I had, I was only guarenteed to bring home $1,336 dollars a month... even though with the tips we made, I normally brought home closer to $1,800 every month. ...  ... At the very least I could bring home nearly $3,000 a month if I got a job with the US postal service...

I have to take an exam ... to see what sort of position I would qualify for... but the better I do on the exam... the better the position.. the better the position... the more money I'd start off making.... I usually do fairly well on tests. ...  The Postal Service supplies you with the exam materials...  They do charge you a 99 dollar fee for them... which after taxes is a bit closer to 120 dollars... but it's totally refundable if you don't pass the exam, or if you aren't guarenteed a job with the postal service during your first interview. 

I've heard the exam the postal workers take is pretty similar to the one people take before they join the military... The Armed Service Aptitude Battery ... or something like that. ... I actually bought a study guide for that exam before, because I was seriously considering joining the military.. and wanted to do well on the exam... I studied... and did well on the practice exams.. so I'm not too worried about how I should be able to do on the postal service exam. ...

The good thing about the postal service would be... Paid training, full paid holiday, and full benefits... all that stuff would be 100% delightful. (not to mention how much money I'd be making :) lol)

Anyway... I need to take a nap... I was only able to sleep for about 3 hours earlier."

"event","Okay, ... This isn't my first entry. Me finding out that I wouldn't be a nazi was my first entry. ... so... I guess that's good. *nods*

Anyway, Not much happening. A bit tired... considering the thought of going to sleep. ... it is after all, 2:25AM...  

I turned in 3 applications today around town... and picked up 6 more that I have to finish getting filled out and turned in tomorrow. I need a job. If I can't find anything around here, I might move. ...

I was thinking about Washington. I have a cousin who lives there and said I could stay with him until I find a job and a place to live on my own. ... I've never been to washington. Hmm... I guess we'll see how things go.

There are 2 or 3 places around town hiring right now so... Maybe someone will call."

Congratulations! You are not susceptible to brainwashing, your values
and cares extend beyond the borders of your own country, and your Blind
Patriotism does not reach unhealthy levels. <b>If you had been German in the 30s, you would've left the country.</b>

<br><br>
One bad scenario -- as I hypothetically project you back in time -- is
that you just wouldn't have cared one way or the other about Nazism.
Maybe politics don't interest you enough. But the fact that you took
this test means they probably do. I'm gonna give you the benefit of the
doubt.<br><br>
Did you know that many of the smartest Germans departed prior to the
beginning of World War II, because they knew some evil shit was
brewing? Brain Drain. Many of them were scientists. It is very possible
you could have been one of them.
<br><br>
Conclusion: <b>born and raised in Germany in the early 1930's, you would not have been a Nazi.</b><br><br>

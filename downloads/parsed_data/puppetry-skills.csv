Once it has failed why must re try and try again to only reach the same result? That man will never return to father. No never. He is much like the burned out star.

Too in love with a false idol. Too many try to live the life of virtue and dwindle down their own life and love for a chance at heaven.

I say forget heaven, forget virtue, I say live for now and live it well.

That is why I have returned to the city that welcomed me with open arms a place that never questioned my views.

I'm back.

Oh Hitomi, Tamaki we simply must get together soon and talk I have missed you both very much and I heard you had a recent loss of some man dying. I can listen if you need to talk.

Shiba where the fuck are you man?

Anyway I gotta go to work for a few hours so I'm out. Beloved's mostly better.

Tamaki, Hitomi I hope everything's good with you two. I have some advice for you two, that saying if you love something let it go don't listen to it. If you love something and it tries to leave break its legs, then it needs you. Just a bit of bitter advice.

I almost lost sight of what I was for so long but this has opened my eyes. I believe I have remembered why I choose this life. Isaak will be proud of me again.

My libido is really getting out of hand, if she hadn't noticed what I was doing I would have probably had forced her into sleeping with me by any means, My mind was already working deceptive lines and mental fuck ups to get the star out of her night gown and weeping beneath me. 

A year ago I would have been all over that and laughed while she wept, this obsession would be done I would have had my lay and been done with her, but something stopped me, something made me talk to her and apologize, what the hell is wrong with me! I need Isaak He acts like he knows everything maybe he can explain why I am no longer partaking in the finer joys in life. Why seeing a great pair of tits doesn't have the same hold it once did. ..

I mean yeah It is still nice to imagine the boob goddess on a trampoline but damn why the hell am I having trouble picturing myself touching another woman besides her?

No problems with men, so have I just lost my woman swoon? Seriously man-bits care to fill the rest of us in on whats going on? We'd like yo know.

Maybe I should just call Konata and get laid. Maybe it would help.{/PRIVATE}

Also, Esther gave birth to our first baby, I was their so I can say <i>ours </i>She named it Roger, its  can be made better faster stronger! I must not steal Roger and play with his insides! I must resist! This is our child not my Frankenstein! I do wonder if she has realized that shes dating a computer wizard? I've been messing with these things since the old school Mac...

This doesn't mean I'm old...FUCK YOU ALL!

But all in all, tonight wasn't half bad.

Yes Esther; I did use Roger! I got you all set up so you don't have to be scared anymore. Be lucky I remembered you cant speak German. I almost switched the languages on you. If you need any help please don't hesitate to wake me. I'll still be sleeping I assure you, I've been running three days without sleep. Yeah I faked going to sleep just so I could play with Roger, but no fear. I'm not cheating with the technology, I was watching you sleep too."

"event","Greetings whoever reads this, 

You must have noticed I always have at least one private cut per post. This is because what I think is solely my right to know. But I'm not making this private, I'm going to make my thoughts open just to do it.

I should not have to be careful about what I say, I should not have to worry if what I say is going to upset people. I am a bastard and I know this, almost everyone who I am friends with can agree with this, Well I'm sure Tamaki would disagree simply because he does not see the bad in people.

I am not sorry that I made a bog deal that I didn't know that Esther was from Europe, Its kind of a big deal to me that I offer information about myself to you but all I really know about you is your an orphan raised by the church, and now that you told me last night. Again most may not see this as a big deal but we have been playing this game for over a year. There are some things I should know.

Also, saying I per claim the fact I'm German. Its hard to hide when I have this wretched accent Esther Blanchett even if I hadn't told you anyone with half a brain would know! Some days I wonder if love is suppose to be this annoying. Every couple days were arguing again and I'm fucking sick of it. I mean most people fight to make up but damn it were not even to that level! After a year of knowing you and taking you out as much as I do, actually falling for you as hard as you and almost all of cross knows I did! I AM STILL WITHOUT! It's getting old.

I don't care what you think about what I've said here, I wont take it back I wont apologize. I have a right to be upset when a simple misunderstanding ended with our date being cute short and you walking out. Its annoying Esther, either learn to deal with the fact I can be a bastard or tell em off SOMETHING! so something besides avoidng the issues! Don't tell me to leave, don't walk off. Face the problem or we will be in limbo forever!

okay now I'm late for work, fuck. Let me know what you want, before midnight.

<div id=""testResultInfo"">
      <h1><!--t-->Your Score<!--/t-->: <span>Class Clown</span></h1>
      <h2>You are 42% Rational, 85% Extroverted, 100% Brutal, and 100% Arrogant.</h2>
       <div id=""testResultInfoImg""><img src=""http://is1.okcupid.com/users/156/664/1566642811609810544/mt1114812073.jpg""></div> 
      <p>
      You are the Class Clown.  This means you wear grease paint and have a big, red nose...
</p><p>
I really need to stop thinking so literally...
</p><p>
Anyway, I MEANT to say that you are the Class Clown, and this means that you are extroverted, mean, and arrogant.  You are not very rational, so you gravitate towards things that produce feelings or emotions over thoughts (like fart jokes or spitballs, for instance).  You are also an extrovert and rather full of yourself, so of course you want constant attention for yourself and think you are somehow better than others.  (Upon hearing the expression ""you are full of yourself"", you probably also slyly feel the need to ask women if they would like to be ""full of yourself"" too.  I am assuming you have a penis.  I often make that assumption, being fond of the penis.)  You can also be a bit mean-spirited, and like a class clown you wouldn't hesitate to make a joke at someone else's expense, no matter how terrible it would make them feel.  A lot of people probably find your antics annoying, sophomoric, and desperately histrionic.  Like some sort of crack-taking hyperactive monkey, you'd do anything, mock anyone, just to get someone to pay attention to you for five seconds.  So your personality defects are that you have to be the center of attention, that you don't care about others, and that you are rather irrational and motivated by intuitions.  Now stop walking around with those books on your head and sit down this instant!  Or else I'll be forced to stand here, hands on my hips, doing nothing once again!
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>To put it less negatively:</b>
</p><p><i>1.  You are more INTUITIVE than rational.
</i></p><p><i>2.  You are more EXTROVERTED than introverted.
</i></p><p><i>3.  You are more BRUTAL than gentle.
</i></p><p><i>4.  You are more ARROGANT than humble.</i>

The dorm just was getting to small and I had issues with being there after a certain point in time.

Yesterday I woke up later than I expected, I always sleep so calm when I am around you dearest. Alas I had to rush out and go to meet Ritsuka Aoyagi for lunch as I had manners of business to speak with him. Next time we met how about we met at the park? Maybe I can show you pictures of beloved. My dear cat, I'm sure you would love it.

Next time you want to let me know because for you I will threw others aside, I'm working today but I should be off around 7:30pm and I don't have any other plans until close 11pm. 

After this I met a beautiful woman whose name slips my mind but god she can make anyone feel better about life just by how disgruntled she is, it was refreshing to see someone that angry but I understand her sentiments now at least if I hadn't before. some animals are annoying, speaking of.

I don't know if I want to go near the cafe after last night but I have a few people I should apologize to after all of that, mostly though I was just angry over what happened I'm not so much anymore. So Tres, I.m sorry I wont bother you anymore alright. Random Japanese man that was defending the Cat I was out of line, sorry.

Hitomi, will you and Tamaki be out tonight? I would like to speak to you both if thats alright.

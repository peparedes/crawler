"event","<center> <small> You said you'd call, but you didn't.
I promise I havn't forgotten about you, can you say the same to me?
What happen to your midnight visits?
And watching me cry at Denny's, eating your hersey's chocolate pie.
You were always tellin' me ""those boys don't treat you right"".
I didn't care, but you were probably right at the time.
We drove to Walmart at 3am, insearch of something I can't remember.
You use to assure me I wasn't gonna die..
I'm not so sure anymore."

"event","<small>i got ready to leave,
was about to go out,
cancelled plans &
crawled in bed instead.
heh. i've grown quite attached to my bed.
it's safe & warm, i could use some rest.

i've been in the <i>missing</i> mood lately,
though i'm not all that sad.
just missing those who aren't around.

i miss my friend.
i hope you smile atleast once, where you are.
maybe i'll give you a call, 
we can talk 'bout how you use to just come over to sleep.
you felt safer in my bed.

<i>my car comes back this week.
my dad asked if i still rememeber how to drive.
this could be a good sign."

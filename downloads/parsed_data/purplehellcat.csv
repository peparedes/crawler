"event","Travis called @ 3am. I was way too tired to answer. So I let it go to voice mail. When I listened to it later, he was so obviously drunk. I love when he calls me ""just to talk"" or whenever he was ""thinking about me."" It makes me feel loved:D

I called Scotty-Bear. Oh! that reminds me. *Note to Scott* I've decided that your new nickname, among the hundreds I have for you, is now Scooter. I don't know why. It just came to me. hahaha. Anyways, I had a nice chat with him. We came to the conclusion that big cities have better transient police that smaller cities. He knows what I mean, even though most of you don't.

More kite flying. And now bike riding. I need a new bike. I'm going to try and get my dad to buy me one tomorrow. That's it. Lates."

"event","Okay, I guess it's about time that I make a real post and not just surveys or meme's. Blame Scott(<lj user=""keohookalani""> for that. He post them and I then feel compelled to do the same.
Anywho. I had to go to a neighborhood block party last Saturday. Like seriously had too. When we(the family and I) weren't there at 3:30-it started at 3, a lady came by to see if we were going to come. I don't know how I feel about this. Its a little weird and scary. So we all left, ate, hung out, and talked to people. It wasn't too bad.
I've also been helping my younger brother plan and shop for his birthday party. His birthday is on the 30th, but the party is going to be the 29th. Its a Mardi Gras themed party so I've had to drive all these places to find stuff. Not only that I, like an idiot, offered to make a cake purely from little cupcakes. I think I'm going to die or pass out when the day comes. Oh! and he invited like 45 kids! 45 little 15-year-old fuckers running around! There just might be a massacre of children if they piss me off. I and my little sister are going to be the only ones here to watch them. My parents are leaving, going to dinner or something. Bitches. I wish I had someone else here to help me. Maybe I can just tranc them all>:) hehe. 
Oh, man. I almost forgot. I have to carve 3 pumpkins. How can I get out of this? Chop my hand off? No too painful and inconvenient.
Well, I have to go for now. Lates all."

While on a boat, you slip and fall overboard. As you struggle to climb back in, your hands are chopped off by the motor's blades. You sink beneath the water as you bleed profusely.

TOP TEN REASONS TRICK -OR- TREATING IS BETTER THAN SEX.
10. You're guaranteed to get at least a little something in the sack.
9. Once you've done it, you don't have to wait an hour to do it again.
8. The uglier you look, the more likely you'll get some.
7. You don't have to make small talk with the person who gives you the treat.
6. The person giving it to you isn't fantasizing that you are someone else.
5. If you get a stomachache, it won't last for 9 months.
4. If you wear a mask, no one thinks you're kinky.
3. It doesn't matter if the kids hear you moaning and groaning.
2. You don't have to call the person that gave it to you.

And the ....1 reason trick-or- treating is better than sex..... ..
1. If you don't get what you want, you can always go next door!!"

<lj-cut text=""Where you going? Oh...there is more."">What would you do if you never met 5? I wouldn't have the memories of the stories that we created and the adventures that we had.

What do you honestly think of 10? I like her, but sometimes she can get annoying fast.

Would or did 19 and 8 date? lol...no, but they were planning on getting married at some point.

Have you ever liked 3? haha...secret time...yes, I have. Bet you all didn't know that one;)

If 1 died tomorrow, what is one thing that you would need him/her to know? That's way sad to think about:(....I would want her to know that I love her very much, and I'm glad that she is my bestfriend. 

Would 2 and 11 make a good couple? Actually, he liked her for a long time, but she didn't think of him in that way. But I don't think that they would be a good couple.

Would 13 and 17 be a lovely couple? omg...that is sexy. If they were bi they would be the hottest couple!

What do you think when you see 8? ""What the fuck were you thinking?! Why are you doing this to yourself and Jamie?""

Tell me something humiliating about 15. I don't know anything humiliating about her.

do you know any of 3's family members? Nope, not a one.

On a scale of 1-10 how cute is 14? aww...she's so adorable. A cute, sweet, short girl, with huge boobs. She gets an 8.

What would you do if 4 just professed their undying love for you? I would be shocked. Then I'd tell him that I cared very much for him, but not in that way. Then I'd take him drinking and dancing to make him feel better:D

What language does 19 speak? English and drunken English(very well I might add)

Who is 9 going out with? Jake H. as far as I know

What is 6's favorite band? I don't think he has one of those. But if he does I sure as hell don't know who it is.

Would you ever date 16? If we both liked girls?....no, she's too old and dear a friend for me to risk messing that up.

Would you ever date 7? Same answer

Is 12 single? yeah, I think

What is 5's middle name? haha...I have no idea...umm....David?

"event","-I've seen a double rainbow. I saw the entire arch of the smaller rainbow, I've never seen that before.

-I talked to Christy on the phone as she, Kendra, Clea, and Courtney headed to Disney World or Land? Which ever one is in California, I can never remember.

-I got lost in my closet. (Don't ask)

-I looked for my winter things/clothes, finding three jackets and ONE glove. I can only assume that the partner to said glove and all my other things are lost in the abyss of boxes in the garage. I hate not being able to find my things.

-I've lost all my socks and had to buy more. I think monsters stole them to make hand puppets.

-I watched ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space""! I love this movie.

-I woke up to a freezing room. I then ended up throwing on all the blankets I could find, burrowing into the middle, curling into a ball, and falling back to sleep. mmm...Warm blankets are good:)

-I watched hundreds of hot air balloons fly over my house. There will be pictures soon, promise. It was so cool to watch. Some even set down near us.

-I almost forgot! I eat antelope for the first time. It was way gross! Better than deer though. I'd be happy to go through the rest of my life never having to eat one of those animals again. Ick:S

And that's all I can remember for now. This weekend is supposed to be eventful. I'm taking my little sister to the Apple Festival, and the Pumpkin Festival or whatever it's called. And my dad wants me to go to some art and crafts/painting thing in Santa Fe. Oh! and my mom wants to check out the balloon festival. I feel tired already.

Hope you all have a good Columbus Day weekend. Lates."

I just feel a need to beat the crap out of something. Man, I wish I had a punching bag to knock around. I used to be able to use Nick's but not anymore, sad. Oh! well, I'll just have to find some other way to let out this aggression. Maybe smoking a cigarette will help calm me.

"event","I've felt this way for a while, but I haven't talked to anyone about it. Mostly because there is no one around to talk to, and I'm not about to talk to my parents that know nothing about what goes on with me.

<lj-cut text=""Don't read if you don't care."">Things have been going fine here in NM. That's not that this is about. It's about things back in MT. Lately I've been thinking about going back to school there, but I'm conflicted about it. I keep thinking, ""Do I want to go back there because it's safe to go back there? Because I know the town, I know that I have friends there and things will be easier to deal with?"" or ""Do I genuinely want to go back to school there because I like the school?"" I don't know what to do. I mean one day I'll want to go back, then the next day I hate the idea of going back. This all might be because I miss everyone there, and I want to be with them when they need me. But I don't what it to be my fail safe. I don't always want to rely on the fact that I can go there and be comfortable, and hope that things will go back to the way they were before I left. I know that things have already changed, that things can't go back to the way that I want them to be.

That brings me to another matter that I have to deal with. I have to deal with said issue either by talking to the actual people I'm talking about or I have to deal with it internally(by letting things work themselves out in my head). I'm having friend issues, again. Big surprise right? I'm always having friend issues, so much fucking drama. Now, I realize that because I'm so far away from a lot of my friends that I can't expect to talk to them all the time. I mean we all have our own lives to deal with. But the lines of communication are all that we have left to keep us connected now. I can't deal with not talking to someone for a long period of time anymore. I can't go weeks without talking to someone then hang out with them for a day or a weekend, and say that everything is alright. Or be like, ""It's okay we'll reconnect on the winter break or spring break or in the summer."" I can't do that anymore, because I won't be able to reconnect with people in such a way. I won't be there in the winter, I won't be there in the spring, and I won't be there all summer. At most I'll have snip-bits of time in all year that I can see people. I don't want to lose people as friends. I don't want to end up having to say, ""Yeah I used to be friends with so-and-so, but we lost touch."" I'm already afraid that I'm losing people, and I don't know how to stop it from happening. And I don't know how to stop myself from pushing people away so that I won't get hurt. I know that it's selfish, but I just don't want the pain that I know will come.</lj-cut>

Well, that's all from me for now. I hope you all are doing better than I am. Lates."

In this moment, you think of love as commitment. Love only works when both people are totally devoted.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/keystoyourheartquiz/"">What Are The Keys To Your Heart?</a></div>

My hair grows so freaking fast it's amazing. Now it's back to a darker color. I have dirty/very light brown hair now. I like it. I might keep it this color for awhile then change it to again, maybe back to blond-we'll see.
Anyways, apparently there is going to be a block party here(on my block) at the end of this month. It maybe fun. I also found out that there are only two houses with pools on this block. I thought that there were more people with pools, I guess I assumed wrong. Mah. 
I also saw ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" today. It was okay. Not as good or scary as I thought that it would be. I mean it had it's moments, but it kinda dragged in some places. But I'm picky, you guys may like it more than I did.

"event","So not only do I hate my mom('cause that's usual), but I hate my dad. Why you ask? BECAUSE THEY GAVE AWAY MY CAR!!!!! That's right my beautiful 2005 silver Dodge Neon. Gone. And to who? Lance, my older brother. He didn't even want it in the first place. Yeah sure we are supposed to be sharing it, but now I can't even drive it when I want to. They let him drive it all the way back up to Montana. They didn't even ask me what I thought about it, they just handed him the keys and it was decided. He asked them of a bike and they handed him the keys to the car! How screwed up is that?! I'm sure if I had asked to take the car they would have thrown a fit. Fucking parents. I expect something like this from my mom, but not my dad. Not from the one that actually loves me. I just can't wait to see their faces when the car comes back ruined, and trashy. 'Cause I know it will. Lance can't take care of a car properly. I know that it's not going to be the same car once he's done with it.

Anyways, on to something else. I've found a good thing about having to move and leave all my friends behind. It weeds out all the true longterm friends. I know that I'll be back there soon and I'll have to see everyone there, and that it will be awkward to have to deal with the people that I didn't keep in touch with. But I'd rather have that than deal with people, for months on end, who don't care about what's going on with me here. It's just weird for me to try and have a conversation with someone who I know doesn't really care. There is just some people who I'd hate to have that happen with. I know that it's better to have real friends than friends that will drop you as soon as you are out of the picture, but it still makes me sad to think that I'm probably going to lose some friends. 

Well sorry if I bummed anyone out. I hope everyone's Labor weekend was lots of fun. Lates."

I assume that it's because of all the fucking pollen and sand than gets blow around all the time. Seriously there have been like 5 sand storms since I moved here. Which are followed by rain. I like rain but not when it's blowing really hard, and causing driving issues. I'm just being whiny I guess.
The sunsets here are gorgeous! I love the colors that the mountains turn. I can't wait til the fall(my favorite season). I'm sure that it's going to beautiful here. 
Umm...I've been think about visiting Christy at LC, and seeing everyone there. I don't know when I would go there, but she wants me there soon. That of course is the response that I thought I would get from her. I'm also trying to talk her into coming to visit me here in the winter. Maybe I'll go there during Spring Break. I don't know yet though, we'll have to see how things go. I would really like to see everyone there. I miss them all very much. Well that's it from me for now.

""Run""

I'll sing it one last time for you
Then we really have to go
You've been the only thing that's right
In all I've done

And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you dear

Louder louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say

To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbye
I nearly do

Light up...

Slower slower
We don't have time for that
All I want is to find an easier way
To get out of our little heads

Have heart my dear
We're bound to be afraid
Even if it's just for a few days
Making up for all this mess

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you dear"

Its not that bad here in NM. We live really close to Albuquerque, seriously like 15-20 minutes away. But I have no one to run around with all day. Well there is Lance, but he's starting to get on my last nerve. I'll be glad when he goes back to college. I have no idea when he is going to be leaving be soon I think. He's going to be returning to MSU-Billings. I know so of you are thinking, ""Why don't you come back too?"" Because I don't like the school enough to want to go back to it. Sorry. Anyways. All I've been doing is unpacking box after box of my crap. Pretty soon I'm going to have to go back to that. I have yet to set my room the way that I want it to be, but as soon as it is I'll take pictures for all you Billings bitches. 

Pictures! That reminds me. I got all the pictures back from so long ago. I even have the infamous 4th of July pictures. They ended up NOT giving me back the naked Christy pictures. But I do have a scanner capable of scanning negatives into pictures. But as per Chris' request I will not be sharing them with anyone but her. Maybe a censored picture will be sent out to those involved in that drunken night. Drinking....ah how I miss thee. 

So upon moving here I inherited three pet fishies. They live in the small pond in our back yard. There's the big one-Vigo, the spotted one-Squishy, and the white kinda see through one-yet to be named.

There are also other kinds of animals in the back yard. There's tiny lizards, toads, humming birds, vultures(I kid you not), and other such flying things. It's kinda cool. I'm sure to come across a snake soon.

As for the boy situation here...its slim pickings. So far just short little high school boys. Sad. Oh and the occasional creepy older guys staring at me. It gets me wondering...where are all the tall hot latino guys? Seriously!

Speaking of money and work. I'm getting shit for pay. I was making so much more at Bath & Body Works. I thought about changing jobs, because I've been getting a lot of offers. But I figure that since I'm only going to be here for a little while longer, I'll stay.

Yep, that's right there is finally a moving date. I'm moving on the 1st of July. How crappy is that?! Oh, and the best part...all the things are going to packed up ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!! This family is really bitchy when it comes to picking when to move. 

And because my parents are making me move, again. I'm punishing them. I basically get torture rights for the next month or so.

In other news. My bruise that I got at the Modest MOuse concert is getting worse. It's gotten bigger and more tender. I can't even walk without wanting to scream in pain. My pant leg brushes against it and I wince. This is so bad. If it gets any worse I'm going to have to take myself to the doctor. I can't imagine what I did to it though. Any thoughts?

Well, time for bed. Have to work in the morning. I hope you all are doin' good. Lates."

"event","Well, yesterday was my first real day of work. It went okay. I was bored of just standing there at the cash register after a while, but it's all good.

After work I laid around for about half an hour. Then I decided to take the dogs for a walk. We went to Two Moon Park and played around there for like 2 hours. Catlin and I ended up climbing on trees the whole time. Maxine decided that she wanted to go for a swim in the river. That didn't go to well. With in seconds she was being swept away by the fast moving water. I screamed and pointed, and Catlin ran down stream to catch her. Thankfully she got to the side and climbed back on to shore. Stupid Dog! I have to admit it was kind of funny though. After that we started walking back to the car. We stopped in a meadow and let Scout chase some deer. While we were waiting for him to come back I saw fox kits. They were so cute! I think there was like 4 or 5 of them. Such cute-ness, I want one. 

After leaving the park we went back to the house, and I fell right asleep. I was then awakened by my cell phone ringing. It was Christy telling me that she and Adam were coming to pick me up. They did, then we went to go get Ryan. From there we went to Blockbuster and rented <i>House of Flying Daggers</i>, and <i>Chicken Run</i>. Then we went to Denny's and were there for a long time. Towards the end an old cowboy was staring at me constantly. It was really freaking me out. The whole time was spent drawing pictures on napkins. Well Christy and Adam were drawing, and Ryan and I watching. Charlotte and Luck showed up at some point during the night. They joined in the fun. After Denny's we went to Christy's to watch the movies. We only got thorough <i>House of Flying Daggers</i>. By the time the movie was over the sun was coming up, so we decided that it was time to go back to our respective houses.

Today is Charlotte's party. I don't know what time it's going to be, but I'm sure that it'll be way fun. Tomorrow is the get together at my house, and I still haven't called everyone. The only people that really know about it are Christy, Ryan, and Adam. And that's only because I've talked about it around them. Well, I hope you all have a fan-tab-uloius weekend. Lates."

"event","Last night Christy, Ryan, Adam, and I had a campfire. Following in the tradition of week day campfire. We tried to get Tim to come with us be he wimped out on us, loser. 

On Sunday Adam came back from college. So what do we do to celebrate? We get fucking drunk! Christy, Adam, and I went out to second bridge and drank all night. Charlotte and Luke showed up a little later, then left like 15 minutes later. We think it was because they couldn't handle our drunkenness. Which is totally understandable. Towards the end of the night we were laying in the darkness and it started to rain on us. A drizzle at first, then I yelled a Christy and Adam that we'd better leave. Then it started to pour on us. We had to hop to barbed wire fence and run to my car. I have a long scratch on my leg from that stupid fence. But I know that it's partly my fault too. We ended up sitting in my car for a long while, because I wasn't sober enough to drive the car. When I finally was I drove to Christy's house, where we all climbed into her bedroom window and fell asleep. We had planned to wake up in an hour, but slept until morning. Fun times.

This weekend the three of us where invited to a party at Charlotte's, which we will of course be going to. And since I have to work this weekend I have to stay home, and not go on the trip to North Dakota. Which of course means.......PARTY AT MY HOUSE!!!!! Of course what else? I have lots of calls to make, lots of plans, and lots of fun to be had this weekend. If you live in Billings you should come by! ;) I'm fairly certain that some people are going to be crashing at my house.

See you all in the funny pages! Lates."

"event","I'm Free! I'm Free! Sorry. Spontaneous moment of happiness. 
If I was any happier I'd piddle. :S Eww, sorry. Actually, I probably still have to deal with the awkward moments when we are amongst the same company. No, not awkward for me anyways. You know why? Because I DON'T FUCKING CARE!!!! You do what you want, you say what you want about me, but people know the truth. And that's all that matters. 

M'kay on to other things. Tonight I went to the Gretchen concert with Jade. It was decent. Lots of little ones-meaning like 16-year-olds. Then we went to Denny's with Christy. We were seated across for a table of little emo kids. I wanted to take a picture of them, and post it under the caption ""Billings Emo Kids."" Christy and I like the fact that there was a sort of ""emo hierarchy."" There were three total emo kids, and three not so emo kids. And they sat together in their respective groups on either side of the table. We figured that the sadder you pretend to be, the more emo bands you get into, the darker your wardrobe gets, the more hair that covers one eye, and the blacker your hair gets, the higher up on the ladder you climb. I can totally make a thesis paper out of this;)

Anyways. Jade's birthday is on Sunday, but (her sister) Sapphire's graduation is on the same day. So I talked her into having a campfire party on Monday. Christy and I will, of course, be in charge of planning the party. But we can't plan until Jade tells us what she wants, and we work around that. So tomorrow is the ""party planning committee meeting."" This should be lots of fun. Even more so because Jade and Adam will be there!

Adam is back on SUNDAY!! Only happiness will follow his return....so much happiness! He's already given us a mission to accomplish. I will not take charge of this one, I still have the left-overs of the last mission. This I shall charge to Christy. With proper supervision of course.

Have a great weekend all! Lates."

"event","So Christy and I have been trying to have a campfire for the past two days, but the weather has not been cooperating. It's been raining and fairly shitty out. Yesterday though it rain then got hot out, which was weird. Tomorrow looks like a good day, so we are going to try yet again. All the fire stuff is still in the back of my car. And there it will remain until we finally have the campfire. There is wood in there that we took from Christy's house, from the tree that her and her dad cut down, and a bunch of stuff we took from my house. Everyone should come to the campfire party! Everyone get off your asses and party with us.

Christy and I both got new things recently. Christy and her family got a new puppy. It's an Australian Healer, I think is what it's called. He's so cute and fun to play with. The best thing is that he plays cat games. Like chasing your hand or toy, not normal dog behavior of just watching the toy move. Christy and I quite enjoy this. I got a new car! Rather Lance and I got a new car. It's a silver 20005 Dodge Neon. It's beautiful! I love it so much. I'll only have it for a little longer, then my dad is going to drive it to New Mexico on the 25th. Sadness. So until then I'm enjoying it to the fullest.

HOLLY IS BACK!!!!!! Today was so exciting! Holly is finally here. She and Jamie(her baby) got in at like 1:00. Jill, Jade, Karma and baby Connor, Jackie, Nikki, and I were there to greet her along with her parents. It was great! Jamie is such a cute baby, and a good baby-not the crying, annoying kind. We then all went to Applebe's for food, then to the house, then to see Amanda at her work. I didn't get home until 6 something. I don't know why I was so tired, but I was and fell asleep right as I got home. It's good to have her back. She's the same old Holly, and I missed her so much. She's way skinner too, skinner than before she got pregnant. Heather maybe coming back this summer too. Which would be so great! I need to see a bunch of people before I move.

I'm so happy that everyone is back. Well, not everyone. One more person needs to be back. Then I will be intensely happy, then the trio will be complete, then we can finally go to the secret spot! Yay! Adam, get you ass back here! I got to see a lot of people last weekend and in the past few days. I saw Tim, Ryan, Katie, Kyle, Nick, Chaslee, Karma, and Holly of course. Nick and Karma were surprises. Karma is leaving to go back to Washington on Friday. Sad.

I hope everyone is doing good. Lates."

It's true. Now to find a guy to throw my love at, heehee. 

Christy and I are bored right now. We're watching <i>Tales From the Hood</i> as of now. Earlier we were looking for a party but no dice. All the people that we know were either not partying or they don't live here or we couldn't get a hold of them. Lame-ness. I/We need to know more people who live in Billings, or near it, and who like to hang out and/or party. *sigh* There is still tomorrow. Lates lovelies."

Your birthday on the 29th adds a tone of idealism to your nature. 

You are imaginative and creative, but rather uncomfortable in the business world. 

You are very aware and sensitive, with outstanding intuitive skills and analytical abilities. 



The 29 reduces to 11, one of the master numbers which often produces much nervous tension. 

This is the birthday of the dreamer rather than the doer. 

You do, however, work very well with people.</td>

What's wrong with me? Seriously? I know most of you won't care but I need to get this off my chest. I've liked this guy for awhile and so far we've only been friends, and that was all well and good. But now it's like I've totally lost interest. How the fuck do I go from liking this guy for so long, and then the next day the feeling is gone? What the hell is wrong with me?! He hasn't done anything to cause this. It just boggles my mind. I'm afraid that soon I won't even want to be friends with him. Which I really don't want to happen. *sigh* my head hurts from thinking about this so much. Maybe it's my mind's way of pushing him away, so I don't have to deal when I move. Bitch! I think that's it. Maybe not. Aarrrggghhh!

Why does listening to ""Rubber Ducky"" make me feel so much better? It totally took my mind off of it. I'm feelin' good right about now. 

<lj-cut text=""I want it now!"">
I want a feast
I want a bean feast
Cream buns, and doughnuts, and fruitcake with no nuts so good you could go nuts.
No, now!

I want a ball
I want a party
Pink macaroons, and a million balloons, and performing baboons and
Give it to me.....now.

I want the world,
I want the whole world.
I want to lock it all up in my pocket
It's my bar of chocolate
Give it to me now!

I want today
I want tomorrow
I want to wear them like braids in my hair, and I don't want to share them

I want a party with roomfuls of laughter
Ten thousand ton of ice cream
And if I don't get the things I am after
I'm going to scream!

I want the works,
I want the whole works!
Presents and prizes and sweets and surprises in all shapes and sizes,
And now!

Don't care how I want it now!
Don't care how I want it now!</lj-cut>"

"event","I'm the only one here at the house right now, except for the animals. I've been watching the kitten spaz out all morning. I'm not sure if he's naturally like this or if he ate something. But either way its way funny to watch, except for when to decides to attack me. I've been watching him freak out the dogs for the past hour. Maxine will fight back (playfully), but Scout will freak and run away-making it worse for himself. Its like watching a live action cartoon. I wish I could record it. 

Double Edge was a bust the other night. A christian-rock-rapper guy was doing a show. So we left. The rest of the night was spent wondering from place to place. I ended up at Jade's twice. The first time I was with Dan, and the second time I was with Christy and Luke. Way fun. Jade, Jill, Christy, and I are going to be going to Gretchen on the 20th. She's playing at Double Edge. So that'll be fun. I heard her on the radio and she sounds pretty good. I'm excited.

So many plans have been made just from a couple days of hanging out with people. Warped Tour plans, Holly coming home plans, camping plans, etc. Luke said that we're welcome to stay at his place when we go to Warped Tour, which is so nice. Jill, Jade, and I are going to be making banners for Holly for her welcome back. We're planning on making it like a mob scene with all the people that will be there to greet her(and Jamie). Everyone is so excited! Only 8 more days! I'm supposed to go camping with Christy and Adam at some point. Then I have to go for the yearly Holly camping trip. That's a lot of camping. Also, Dan has decided that since I'm going to be moving we have to spend lots of time together. Which I'm totally fine with. 

Hope you all are doin' good. Lates."

"event","Yesterday was filled with activity. First I got my hair cut, three inches! Who knew that I had three inches of hair to waste? Then to the house for a shower. Then with Lance to the DMV, then to Hastings to screw around for awhile, then house. Then with mom and dad to look at cars. Found some really nice ones. Dad was looking at a car that was a ""mafia"" car, that's what I called it anyways. I could go really fast, has a HUGE trunk, and looked all ritzy-like. So naturally I assumed. Then house again. Then to Blockbuster with Catlin, then BigLots, then Wal-Mart, then house. At Wal-Mart I picked up a welcome back present for Chris and a camera for the party. Sometime in all that mess I called Jill, she hasn't called back yet though, hopefully soon. Damn it! that reminds me that I have to call all the other people on the party list too. And clean my room, and wash my clothes, and wash blankets. Things I very much do not want to do. Arrggh! Someone want to do them for me?..................I didn't think so.

Also yesterday was filled with sneezing, watery eyes, and itchy eyes. That's right thanks to mother nature's cruel humor the wind was blowing and the flowers opening, all the while I was outside. That was fun.

My wonderfully great brother Lance will be leaving on Saturday. He's going to Florida for like a month, the lucky bastard! I want to go, I want to be back on the East Coast, I want to visit my friends there, I want to see the wondrous ocean again. *sigh* Some day I will again be back in the east. I do get to wake up early, and drop him off at the airport tomorrow. Yay! what fun for me.

The day has come! The day is here! Three important people are come back today. Christy! Dan! and Ryan! Yeah-a! Best friend Christy is here! Best friend Christy is here! I'm so happy. Tomorrow night we are going to be partying it up! Wooo! One way or another there will be partying. I'm so excited I think I just piddled. eww. haha :D Hope you all are going to be having fun this weekend.

Well, time to start on my self appointed chores. Lates."

"event","I had to put my cat to sleep today. She was really old, and her kidneys were failing. So to end her pain we had to put her down. If you're keeping count that that's three pets gone, two of which are/were mine. I'm so emotional drained. I've cried so much, I think I've drained all the tears in my body. Hopefully with the return of friends this week I'll be better. *sigh* Hope you all are better than me. Lates"

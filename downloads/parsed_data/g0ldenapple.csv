"event","When ever i need to be creative i turn on music and just type.  I type my thoughts on the project.. where i want the project to end up and who i want to impress with it. I type out the impression i want anyone who reads  my work and start to form an outline.  a lot of times its 2 or 3 pages of run on sentences.. but it gives me a start.


 I am working on a guest promotion for the hotel.. ive had zero time to think about it and is has to be done by tomorrow.(Monday)

im skilled... i m excited and i believe in the promotion.. how do i get the staff to feel the same way?

Education, Enthusiasm and Feedback.  Once i put out what i am going to create i need to teach them inside and out.. i have to write up the dialogue, so it flows from everyone.. sounds natural and not scripted.. but will give them an edge to impress our guests.
 I have to be excited.  If I believe in something staff members will believe it and so guests will believe it.  It has to be fun.  People aren't enthusiastic about things that are time consuming and boring.  I also need feedback.. once we test it out I need to know what works and what doesn't.  


This is where i excel.. so why am i having soo many issues 

UGH.  Btw... i like glee but glee cast versions of popular songs are not helping 

-.-  

wish me luck"

I'd tell them you dont need to be a jerk to get your message across.  She upset me so much the entire year i had her.  I had stomach aches.. nerves SHIT TONS OF ACNE BREAK OUTS it was my worst school year ever.  I developed an ulcer and i missed soo much school because i couldnt stand her.
  I dreaded lunch cause i knew after i ate id have to sit in her class and listen to her.  I dont mind people pushing their opinions on me.  But i dontl ike it when someone tells me how i feel or think is wrong.

Id like to tell her that as a teacher you are a huge influence on your students.  If your having a bad time it shows.  Either embrace your love as a teacher/learning OR find something else you love."

"event","I AM SO EXCITED two things


a) MY HUSBAND AND I ARE BUYING A BED!!!!  we have been sleeping on the floor for a few years.  The bed we had for the longest time got super uncomfortable so we updated to a bed from walmart.  Well the frame broke and now the 3 inch thick mattress lays on the floor.. its been like that for about 3 years.  My back kills me.. every time I roll over my hips hurt and I wake up a ton through out the evening.  I could sleep for 10 hours feel like I never went to bed and be in soo much pain that is hurts to do anything.  So I test drove 5 different mattresses today.. looking forward to picking one out tomorrow!

b) I start beauty school march 7th!  I started getting into nails and hair in 2009.  I started off by reading a blog called purse buzz (her you tube channel is here: http://www.youtube.com/user/pursebuzz ) .. I went from there. I also found a make up blogger named MissChievous when I was looking for make up for a fairy custome ( link here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjEJSgi8Yvw )Reading hair magazines and eventually reading about make up and finally getting into nails.. I have loyally for over 10 years every two weeks got my nails done.  When bob wanted to buy a house I wanted to cut expenses so I started doing my own.  If you page through my face book you can see how much better ive gotten over the past 3 years!  


After doing my own nails and make up im super excited about learning a new trade.  I love Guest Service which I provide as a supervisor at my hotel.. however some day I may want to take my peopleskills to the next level and help someone feel as confident and beautiful as they want too.  I also want to figure out how to do my niece Jasmines hair it can be quite a monster to tame with  mixed ethnic textures.  So if I can figure out how to make her hair look amazing too that would be a big plus!"

"event","Man I was soo pissed at bob when I woke up this morning.   I had a dream where bob and I separated and three months into it he got someone he was seeing pregnant.  I was pissed in my dream and I was mega mad when I woke up.  It carried into work where I just wasn't very pleasant looking.

It's odd how the brain interprets emotions like that.  It sort of twisted my sadness of not having children into being really pissed off at bob.

I felt kinda bad later in the day.. Bob asked why was cross with him.. I apologized told him I had a bad dream.

I asked him if he was seeing anyone.. he said nope.  And with that my anger almost completely disappeared.

How dumb!  I feel soo bad for being mad at him for something he did in a dream my mind made up!

"event","Snow driving is not something I take very lightly.  The Last time I drove in snow I managed to roll my car after losing control on ice at low speeds in 2008.  If it is calling for snow Bob takes me to work.  
At the end of my shift today I realized there wasn't enough rooms with working heat in them for all the employees that wanted to stay, so I drove home.   A little nervous I called my husband he said okay see you soon.  SO I called my dad.  Talked to him for about 20 minutes as I drove home.  The weather wasnt terrible I had driven through worse but I was just nervous.  

I was kind of impressed that my dad chatted with me after making fun of me.  Ive not always seen eye to eye with my dad. He is stubborn and hot tempered.. So am I. He gets his way and so do I.  My intentions are always genuine and in the best interest of everyone involved, but where I fail is getting everyone to embrace my way of doing things.  I think my dad is like that too.  Sometimes I come off as brash and abrasive... I am really just concentrating  or im terribly shy. I don't think my dad is shy at all but I do think he can be abrasive when focused.  It kind of sucks when you realize the person you cant stand the most.. you are most similar too.

He did help me out a lot while searching for a home thou I did get pissed at him when I asked him his opinion of a house and he blew smoke up my ass.  I called him annoyed--- asking him do you think this is a project I can handle?  I explained I don't know crap about construction or houses.  I don't know what goes into fixing a roof leak. And I defiantly don't know anything about VA Loan Regulations.  He finally told me he felt the house would be a money pit of sorts and he didn't think bob and I could handle all the work needed and follow through.  From that point on he was a whole lot more direct and honest with me. I know I am a drama queen that is very emotional.  I get that.. but when it comes to financing my husbands dreams I need really good advice other wise ill get in way over my head and purchase something I cannot afford :(.

  My dad never tried to be my friend. But he did tell me when I did something stupid and I shouldn't do it again.  He never really lectured me or grounded me either. I defiantly do NOT agree with his style of discipline but in the end I think I turned out okay. I know I didnt go down the path my mom and dad wanted me too but It's not their life.  I did the best I could with the cards I was dealt.  And I think finally my dad accepts that.

It;s nice to be able to talk to my parents and annmarie like I have been for the past year or so. I am trying hard to strengthen those relationships and so FAR SO GOOD!

A true friend realizes that I may not be perfect and i do say the wrong thing a lot of the time...I do it out of fear of losing them as a friend.  I am so shy and i get very anxious around people. i try very hard to make them smile.. this sometimes doesn't go so well and i end up pissing someone off -.- esp if they dont know me well 

A true friend realizes your short comings and can overlook them.

If a friend was trying to push me into doing something that made me uncomfortable i would end a friendship.  I had a guy that i was hanging out with a lot that had a thing for younger girls.  he tried to push me into helping him pick up 16 y/o's by approaching them and becoming friends with them.  It was an odd request and i terminated the friendship and had nothing to do with him.  Very disappointing.. we had a lot of fun"

My favorite holiday has to be thanksgiving.  a whole holiday that is centered around eating our selves silly then falling asleep watching the football game.  Its soo much less stressful than Christmas is for sure.

that brings me to my dislike holiday:

Christmas.  I would love if it was just a holiday where i got to see family and check out all the lights people have put up around their homes...but it's not.. it's about finding the right gift for someone who more than likely will just buy me a pair of socks.  i got a friend a gift and when i visted them a few years later i noticed the gift was still in it's box in a closet.  i wasnt offended but it really put gift giving into prespective.  why should i stress out about finding the perfect gift for someone?  hell no.. ill buy people stuff i would like to give them.. ie.. i wanted to give my inlaws a soda stream.. and my sisters make up kits.. so i did.

why stress and put youurself into at tight money situation just for it to sit in their closet?  forget that mess.. pass me the stuffing and enjoy your home made soda.

I had an okay day .  Paid my enrollment for school. And I talked to a few people about Stabbings as their example for a high pressure situations. and had lunch out with my husband.  All in all an okay day. 


Ive been watching a show lately called the Big C.  some of it is a little depressing since it does deal with a woman dying of cancer but overall it's a good show.  Just finished up watching the season.  Cant wait to see season 2 on show time :) the Season Final was rather tear jerking at the end.

Watching it.. even thou it is rather light hearted has made me realize that I spend too much time online.  And im going to cut a ton of that out soon.  I got shit I want to do:) and people to see.  Sitting alone all the time is kind of lame........

I ALSO GOT NEW PAJAMAS!  Ya its dorky and frump but im soo comfortable :P and really that is all that matters!
Just am arm shot I got bad allergies and my make up is running from crying about the big c show ending..... =/

I am going to put some money down to hold a seat in the March 7th class.  I am very excited about it.  Its a really great feeling to learn more about something im super interested in.  I love the hotel industry and it has always supported me, however it is time to expand my horizons and learn something new.  I dont think I will ever leave the wonderful world of hotels to be honest.  I hope my deposit today is the BIG STEP leading to possibly a side business in my future where I can make women and men feel awesome about themselves with a bit of color, cut and set :)<br /><br />Here is all the nail art ive done for myself. I just started in april 2010 :) so SO FAR SO GOOD :)<br />I really need a better camera.. using my phone is okay but id rather show off GREAT :D<br /><br /><a target=""_blank""

&nbsp; ENROLLED!
Very excited i enrolled in beauty school. i am super super excited. I had no idea that looking on the internet for new hairstyles would eventually fuel my passion for all things beauty.

In 2009 i was trying to make myself look more professional. I started following my favorite beauty blogger purse buzz on you tube. i was instantly hooked watching hair and make up tutorials. I then started watching nail ones. At the time i was getting my nails done .... i had been getting them done since i was 15. When we decided to buy a house i realize the 55+++++++$$ i was spending every two weeks could be put towards something else. so i bought nail polishes and i was off and running. MY FIRST nail guru i fell in love with was LOVE4NAILS and Cute Polish.

I am very excited about starting my education towards a new career. My first day is March 7th.

My co worker pat said something to me that helped me make the final jump..

Me: &quot;I want to go to beauty school but i am so worried I wont make any money at it&quot;
Pat: &quot;You dont make any money where you are at now.. What's the difference.&quot;

Shes right. and off i go!"

His face fell....

Bob&nbsp; &quot;Why wouldnt you want to go to Vegas&quot;
Me&nbsp; &quot; I&nbsp;dont get vacation time at work so the trip would have to be a short one.&nbsp; Niagara is much closer.&quot;
Bob&nbsp; &quot;&nbsp;You sure you cant do Vegas?&quot;
Me&nbsp; &quot;Y&quot;a id luv to see the falls&nbsp; been a dream of mine&quot;
Bob &quot; OKay i guess.&nbsp; ill see what i can find&quot;

:(&nbsp; i totally lied i didnt want to go to any place where i had to fly because last time i flew bob and i got bumped off the flight.&nbsp; When we were talking to the ticket agent making new flight arrangements she asked me if id prefer two seats to accomodate me.&nbsp; One of the other passengers behind me snorted and said... &quot;well if she doesnt take two seats i will if im next to her&quot;&nbsp; The ticket Agent gave a slight giggle.

Thats it no more flying 

Im sorry Bob.&nbsp; Im sorry im overweight and people think its a Joke.&nbsp; and most importantly im sorry i ruined your want to go to vegas because im selfconscience.

"event","some good friends of mine were considering getting divorced.. being the odd person in the middle i heard them constantly complain about one another.&nbsp; Finally i got something out of both of them that was fairly useful.. He was mad she spent soo much time online and had several men she would talk to constantly..He&nbsp;felt it&nbsp;was cheating and he would&nbsp;constnatly argue with her&nbsp;about it.. finally she pulled away from him&nbsp;since&nbsp;he was always angry and&nbsp;their sex life had died.&nbsp; He cheated a few times and was ready to walk out the door.&nbsp;Eventually he told her&nbsp;he wanted a divorce then&nbsp;both called me she crying and him yelling.. it was just soo odd.&nbsp; at 2am.. omg.&nbsp; 


after calming both of them down.. they got a hotel room got dinner the next day and talked&nbsp; i got them a room since i work for a hotel.&nbsp; i guess that jolt of him wanting to leave kind of reignited things between them. 

so now i get the constant tells about their sexlife.&nbsp; /sigh.&nbsp; its not info i want to hear really. 
i helped her shop for new toys and new lingerie&nbsp; and he tells me the new positions they are trying and how shes trying to take the role of dominate one in the bedroom.&nbsp; its great for them but it tortures me.. bob and i dont have sex and hearing about those two makes me soo jealous. 

im glad i was there for them when things were bad... but ugh keep some of the sex stuf to urselves.. thats private!

=My work life isnt much better.&nbsp; one of our supervisors is now getting her own office.&nbsp; Im jealous as fuck.. why?&nbsp; because shes a very very rude person snaps at people and has zero idea how to manage people.&nbsp; Shes been called into mmgt meetings to discuss her behavior and now she sgetting rewarded.

why cant good stuff happen to me.&nbsp; fuck.&nbsp; i really need to make some changes this year because nothing good ever comes into play.&nbsp; I know good things have to be created but i dont know hwo to make a situation work out in my favor.im at a loss. :(

i got to cleanse my heart of all this jealousy&nbsp;, its just not worth living to be this upset and angry :("

Now its dec 27th.. I received no gifts&hellip; didn&rsquo;t buy any and since bob wouldn&rsquo;t get the tree down for me.. I had no tree up. I totally missed the entire Christmas thing. I talked to sooo many people.. &ldquo;Christmas is my favorite time of the year!&rdquo; I just woke up.. Went to Sheetz for breakfast.. Then to work. It was another day for me, except the hotel was super slow. 

I&rsquo;m plagued by bad memories I cant let go of. Also instead of making new ones to replace the old, i get so sad I avoid everything all together. It&rsquo;s miserable. 


So what do I do now.. well I cant go and decorate the house with xmas stuff.. bob wont appreciate it and id just feel super silly.&nbsp; 

I really want to participate in life again and im really not sure how. Go away sadness go away."

How can a man say he loves his wife.. and only wants her to be happy.. yet wont even approach having sex.

i wish i could be who he wanted.

im not even attracted to him any more.&nbsp; /sigh. and the thought of having sex with him .. well its been soo long.. that i dont even want too.&nbsp; when i try and be intimate&nbsp; he just blows it off.&nbsp; like i kiss his mouth and he doesnt even move his head at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; i want a real relationship.&nbsp; everything right now is soo crummy.. i

hes exactly right.. its not very often i got someone who is willing to digest everything i say&nbsp; i said nah i talk to lots of people.&nbsp; but.. little does he know hes probably the only person who will ask me how my day is this week.

now that im thinking about it gosh im lonely im soo glad he listens.&nbsp;&nbsp; im gonna try to talk less now haha.&nbsp; so he doesnt get that impression&nbsp; i dont want to seem desparate."

"event","so i was going through my <a href=""http://g0ldenapple.deviantart.com/"">deviant ar</a>t and came across something i wrote 4 years ago.&nbsp; its kinda sad.&nbsp; nothing has changed:(<br /><br />Submitted: <span title=""218w 21h ago"">July 31, 2004</span><br />This is going to be a little long so  bear with me <img height=""15"" width=""15"" title="":) (Smile)"" alt="":)"" src=""http://e.deviantart.com/emoticons/s/smile.gif"" /><br /> this piece has some meaning. A few artist that I watch have posted pieces similar to this one so I got an idea ill go to one of the beaches here and see if I can do it. Its something that has been done a million and 1 times but who cares it&rsquo;s a lovely photo. So I got some batteries for my digital camera and asked my husband to drive me to the beach. It was super hot out and now my husband has a fabulously scorching sun burn hehe oops&hellip; but anyways so I find a stick and draw in the sand. And start snapping photos trying to get myself and the sun aligned properly so as to not flood the camera with soo much light which isn&rsquo;t easy in bare feet because rocks hurt! So.. This was yesterday and now I&rsquo;m editing these photos, most of them were taken just to show my mom the beach so I didn&rsquo;t use the highest quality settings on my camera, and I came across all the heart pictures. When I looked at them I noticed some heart outlines I drew heavier than others and the ocean water hits them all differently. Some parts of the heart are carved into the sand much harder and are much more permanent being able to stand up to the water when it comes to wash it away. Adversely other parts as soon as the water comes up are completely erased. And some are slowly fading. All the different hearts are like interests or people or just stuff in my life. Some things I am able to count on , other things I cannot and others are slowly fading away. The first thing I thought of when I saw these hearts with pieces of them fading away is my relationship with my husband. Its fading and soon nothing will be left unless another heart is carved out. Be it by me or by my husband. And if its not re-carved into the sand it will be gone forever. Some things aren&rsquo;t meant to be like hearts close to the ocean tide. U cant expect them to be there in 10years from now if they aren&rsquo;t carved in deep enough and far enough away. But even then they can be trampled by other things especially if they are not strong enough. So if your going to put a heart into the side make sure u do it deep and it stays strong. Make sure u care of it and check on it. Most of all make sure that u do it with all the energy that you have or it will be washed away with out u really realizing&hellip;.<br /> <br /> <br /> I hope u see my point. Sorry I&rsquo;m not  very eloquent&hellip;.<br /><br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/g0ldenapple/pic/00006r7h/""><img height=""142"" border=""0"" width=""320"" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/g0ldenapple/pic/00006r7h/s320x240"" alt="""" /></a><br />"

"event","ive been sort of alternative when it comes to love and sex.  im incredibly open minded on both fronts.  Is it possible to love two people at once?  Absolutly! however is it worth the time and enregy and the shitty emotions  thou?  Is it fair to you or them to share yourself and not give both your all?  

He is having issues with his wife, has been for sometime.  What saddens me is the fact he just wants to give up.  I dont want him to do that.  i know what its like to be married to someone in the military and the stresses it brings.  Not only is it stressful for both of them, they also  have two small children.  I love this man dearly..But i know his happiness is with his children and their mother.  He claims hes disappointed but  i know what he really wants and its his family.

 ive had this for a while.. but these feelings are only able to fester because of the issues i am having a home.  bob doesnt want sex.  Infact we havent had it in 7 years.  Ive never had sex with bob as my husband only while we were dating.. it was bad sex but it wasnt great either.  I thought that great sex comes with a deeper love you develope.  i still belive that.

I am not sure how much more i can deal with bobs depression.. I am trying to fight mine but he ignores it. I try to do everything in my power to help him but he doesnt want my help.  He really doesnt want to go to counsiling but i think it would help us both. i dont want ot lose my husband, but i dont want to miss out on the things a good marriage has.

I guess many people have not had to deal with sitting at work for 12 hours when you are only being paid for 6.

Afer a few minutes i got the Saftey Belt unlatched and i was standing in my car on its side on the passenger window..  AN officer comes up.. i am holding my car door open and says 'I need your liscence, registration and proof of insurance.""  I told him the glove box popped open and my stuff is scattered everywhere.. he asked can you look for it.  I said no.  

AFter the fire dep got me out of my car.  i wsa read the riot act.. basically i was getting fined a LOT for my accident.  All said and done my accident cost me 1100 ( would have cost me about 3k but i fought some of the ticketing.)  Witnesses said i wasnt driving fast, infact i was going kind of slow   But in my stupidity i didnt get any of the names or numbers of  the witnesses and i guess neither did the police department.

week later bobs engine blew out in his car and the estimates to fix it were higher than the car was worth  so he bought a new car.. NOT trading in his old one.  SO now  im paying for 3 cars.. Totaled car, Bobs Old car and bobs new car.  The insurance CO has not made a pay out yet.  So im still paying insurance and Car payments.. bob and i cant buy a new car until then because that is still 3 cars sitting on my policy..  My checking account has 300$ in it ( 12 in savings  ) after i paid off all the fines and the $400 dollar new insurance Fee.  So im freaking out.. our account usually sits at 1500 at all times.. Now its lower than it has ever been.. and the bank is charging us for not keeping t he min balance of 1000.  

Im soo mad:( upset and Fuck i duno what else to do :(((("

"event","probably, i did do a bitch mood.  When mathis quit sacred and tossed GM to sophey i sent sophey an email asking what the plans were.  I was second in command of sacred... I created it, so of course i want to know what the newly minted gm would want to do.  He never responded to me.. 2 days later i saw my self demoted.  In-fact i was demoted the second i went offline. 

So i asked again why was i removed of my post?  why am i being punished for mathias?  Got nothing.  So i raided one last night with sacred then took my leave when there was only 6 people online.  I then deleted the recruitment section.  That was all my work.  no one else's..so they can do the work themselves.. AT the point in which i deleted that section i took out probably 12 new applicants that  I myself had contacted, went on their servers and interviewed.

Because i had been paying for the website i called the company up said my credit card is on an account can i  have it removed.. they said the only way to remove it is to cancel the account. So i gave them my number and the Site went down about 2 hours later.  the operator on the phone assured me that none of the SQL databases will be deleted, just suspended until the account was paid for.  I asked if they could give me the log in info.. they said nope.  just that they could cancel the account, because i couldnt verify the screen name.

All sophey has to do is pony up 39.99  and the site and its dkp will all be brought right back up :). 

 I have been accepted to 7 different guilds.  2 of which are just sitting around waiting for sunwell, while the other 4 are on Mother or Illidari council.   i found a 8th working on RoS.  All of which have better raiding times for me .  i am not worredi about my raiding future giadia is well geared and i have a strong BT and Hyjal Knowledge.  I am revered with both factions.

 I am extremely sick of people not dealing with the consequences of their actions. Sophey fucked up, so did mathis big time.  They sadly just picked the wrong bitch to pissoff. Unfortunately since i took the site down a lot of people think rather low of me, however they will see that the new leadership in sacred will not only fail, but gives two shits about the memebers they have. a Punishment system?!  wtf... if you have to punish people just boot them for god sakes.  

 Mathias did a very stupid childish thing when he quit.  and sadly because of his stupidity.. the rest of sacred will pay the price because of poor decisions made by sophey. Mathias tried to rebuild fatal and it failed, just like sophey trying to rebuild Serious Business will eventually fail.  I wish they would have just worked with me.

 I am one of the best recruitment officers you will find. i am aggressive and i know my shit.. ill lvl a char to lvl 3 to make 30 copper to send you my site info. i can talk anyone into coming to sacred and if i wanted too i could talk those who i recruited into leaving sacred.  I have decided to just take time away and let either sophey remove his head out of his ass and work to get sacred back on track or let the fall-out begin.  I have not contacted any players and i wont.  I have no intentions of building another guild. Ive been running guilds since  i hit lvl 60 on my mage.  I dont want to do that any more.  I want to show up for raids get my shit and move on.  let someone else worry about attendence or if so and so is pissed at someone else.  

I wish sacred the best of luck."

""Shes slipping on her work and shes just spiraling downwards.  I don't even enjoy being around her.  She wants to take over insurance but I see that its a mess now that i have to fix. Looking for her replacement isn't a bad idea."""

"event","Frustrated.

Work frustrations are just dragging me down to the point i want to cry!  Dana has given me more responsibility and i still dont have much time to do it in.  Dr Joe hasnt finished my office, discussed about filling my position or has finalized hours they want me to work.

So im a little annoyed at the slowness of getting my own space to dedicate fully to insurance.  So i keep falling behind on desk work and insurance.  

My second job is working out ok.  Still just like the other is a little stressful.  My schedule is as follows
Monday 10a-7.30pm  (drs office) Tuesday 8a-1p (drs office)  11p-7a(hotel) Wednesday  3-7.30 (drs)
Thursday 8a-7.30pm (drs)  11p-7a Hotel  Fri& Sat 11p-7a.  Sunday 11p-7a

its killing me i hope i finish training soon so  i can just work fri and saturday at the hotel :(

On the plus side i am moving out of my inlaws oct 29th.. i even got the day off work so i could move in :)

yay!

Im not inferior.. but i feel that way.  when i was younger if i looked my dad in the eye he saw it as a challenge.  How do i break that.  
My car is getting new brakes today i HOPE it doesnt cost me much.  please hope for me i dont have much money :(

Two good friends joined my guild today.  I felt terrible about it thou.   they jumped in my vent and asked me raid times and loot policies.  i thought nothing of it till i saw them app.  I hope graciela isnt upset with me.  It was nothing i did.. still i feel terrible
  Sacred is going to be turned over to me soon. Ill be the gm :) for a few weeks tilll the current GM comes back.  that kinds sucks in a way because im always late to raids mondays.  But im always on time tues which is a progression night.

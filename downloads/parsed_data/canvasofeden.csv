"event","So...livejournal..how are you doing? its been too long. I'm sitting in my room, in tokyo and i am leaving here in the morning. Its too much. I was just reading over what i wrote the night that I was leaving...man, i had no idea what i was in store for. I've made so many good friends here. I never expected to feel this sad about not seeing the same people everyday. I've had a wonderful time, learned a lot about myself and was humbled by a culture that i could never begin to understand. I cant say that i'm ready to leave, but that is life, it goes by quick. The craziest part is that I am going to Thailand. That was a ridiculously unexpected occurence. 10 days of a country where i can live like a king for $10 a day. heh. I will be home may 4th, i gotta go back to my job right away-i'm gonna be beyond broke. Its definitely going to be a reverse culture shock, i can't imagine walking around a city where i can read the signs again. I can't imagine communicating easily. As good as those things my sound, its been fun to be...literally ""lost in translation"" I walk around sleepy eyed everyday here trying to soak in what i am seeing.

i'm curious to see what the summer will bring. It seems like just about everyone has turned 21. alcholism part II. I hope that the fact that just about no one will be home doesn't suck too much. I have a feeling i'm gonna hang out with the people i met on this trip a lot. I'd like to introduce a lot of these kids to some people at home i think everyone would get along.

I am officially sad.

the Thailand excitement should set in soon, i hope.

"event","Rationalization-what an interesting human action.
If we wanted to get formal we could reference Freud here and the third part of the psyche-The Super Ego.
It is our brain's way of setting parameters so we stay within the boundaries, or we can rationalize something as okay in order for one to complete an act. For instance, going to war can be rationalized as fighting for one's country (bullshit ehhem.sorry) anyway...interesting human action indeed. What is it that creates these parameters and induces the amounts of rationalization that occurs. Why can some kill another human being and be completely fine with it. We convince ourselves on a daily basis about certain things and just go on with our lives. The alarm goes off, you hit the snooze button..how many times? once. twice. dont get up...ect. The truth is though, no matter how much you rationalize it'll come back and bite you in the ass..hard. ouch.

One more final tomorrow and then i'm done...yippee for break/fuck yeah!
In other news we got a puppy. My parents actually wanted a puppy! Her name is Sadie (i got to name her and I thought the Beatles could come in handy here) She is the most adorable thing i have ever seen in my life. Seeing her is love at first sight. She probably weighs under a pound and is the size of my hand (and if you know me, you know my hands are tiny) I love her!
 
I am leaving the country in less then three weeks..holy shit. I am not getting used to the idea, i have nothing done, i need to seriously start getting shit together and taking care of things like car insurance and my cell phone. I am scared, but so excited and that is not changing. I have felt worried, but how could I not be ecstatic. It's going to be great. Culture Shock here i come."

school has begun again and its same ol' same ol'. the whole commuting thing is not too bad at all..we have this massive car pool and it makes it less painful and sometimes even borderline ""fun"".heh. Last week I went into center city after class a few times (trying to do that as much as possible before the cold), the first time to find a hookah for Jason for his B-day and boris and I stumbled upon this store called Foreign Baazar its a really great place, its cheap and has a huuuge selection of jewlery. Then on Thursday Carla and I went to visit Lauren's place. Its fuckin awesome. literally ON broad st. Its exactly what I would imagine an apt. for Lauren to look like. Her place made me want an apt by myself. Its a nice idea. eat, sleep, and be merry-naked-cuz you can.

Boris and I went to NYC for the weekend to visit Jason and it was a real good time. we all just chilled out and hung around, we sat in washington square park today for a while and I wished that i didnt have to go back to my suburb, but alas back in the land of cars and shopping centers.

the one big news that I do have is that I got my acceptance letter to Tokyo and I put down my deposit so if it was only 95% real before its 99.999999% now. I'm so fuckin excited!its seriously unreal- in about four months I am going to be across the world in Japan.

"event","strange week...
got started off with a rather large party at rachel's on sunday at which i was possibly more drunk than i have ever been and i mean that sincerely. Got into a biig fight with Boris there over something that shouldn't even be discussed, but after that was over things between us have been (knocking on wood) faanntastic!
i've grown a huge love for flip cup I've been playing it often enough that my body is definitely mad at me..i've never partied as much as I have this summer.
i've also grown an obsession with seeing movies at the ritz-thursday night was the third one in three weeks..i've seen: me and you and everyone we know (5 stars), happy endings(4 stars) and broken flowers which you'd think would be the best having bill murray and being a focus feature it was the weakest of the three, but still really good.
and somewhere in between I moved out of my apt. that was a really weird experience...
I think that me and boris cleaned and scrubbed stove/oven for mmmm 3 hrs. after that ball of fun we needed to go to the bar-we went to Locust Bar on 10th and Locust it was a really awesome place that thankfully didn't card..i liked the atmosphere a lot.
I really thought that I would be more sad to leave my place, but the truth is as I walked out and hugged my former roommate good-bye I didnt  even have the urge to turn around. It was a place where I sat around like a lazy fuck everyday and somewhere in the realm of 10 i'd do mm maybe some work maybe not. It was a place where anger and unspoken irritation was more common than friendship.
4 girls lived together for almost a year and have practically nothing to show for it-friendship..uhhh riight..maybe i take things to seriously or too close to my heart, but well it doesn't even matter anymore. 
Jaimie got an awesome place on 9th and Pine I'm in love with it, hardwood floors, two floors, alcove and an apt with the address of 420 right next door that happens to have a purple door..cute.
Lauren also got a place-broad and lombard which is a great location especially for the subway..she seems pretty good considering her recent break-up..shaady business.
but in anyway i have places to stay some nights so the commute isn't too bad...

          Its odd when you find yourself in literally a second of time, a second, and its all clear there. Everything makes sense-you have all of the answers to all of the questions that you have been pondering. Its like tripping -when your in and around your peak and you feel like master of the universe (atleast I do) where all of your why's are answered. the bad part about thinking that you have the anwers is that rational things can occur and things that you dont want to have surfaced do.

you cease to amaze me-who is the good one here? is it the friend or is it the accquaintance (can i call him that..weird-i have no other word that is, well, okay to use) well maybe not the good one, but the one that still gives a shit. and i thought i knew all the answers(its like i'm flirting with myself)

but anyway i watched a really really great movie tonight that I am recommending to all-The United States of Leland..really good actors who did a really good fuckin job. watch it.
several lines in it were dead on, but one inparticular i liked.   one charecter says ""i'm only human"" and the other says ""did you ever notice how you only say that right after you admit something wrong"" that no one ever says ""i'm only human"" after they have rescued a little kid from a burning building.

Summer just keeps getting more and more interesting and although I feel like these last few entries have been just talking about summer, and how i like it, or dont, or blah blah..but summer is a really special time as I cannot emphasize enough. Last night I par-took in my drug of choice once again-fantastic. I like feeling bonds with people from experiences beyond our usual realm (well mind) and I know its terribly cliche and you can't just have bonds with people based on something that MAKES you feel a certain way, but in a way you do and it can be a lot stronger than one where someone is worried about what they are going to say or how they will sound or what the other person will ultimately think of them. And i know its sad when you need a drug to break these barriers, but you know what sometimes you just do. Theres nothing wrong with that, one could say that its not ""real"" or ""real life"", but fuck, what is? And who are we to judge and make these statements-err standards. Anything is bad excessively-anything and I know this and keep my adventures to a minimum for more reasons than one. Its just better not to have regrets. I dont want to be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen and ask myself-why didn't you experience this? And i certaintly will not apologize for my actions nor do I feel bad about them.

I love him. I love him so much more than I ever thought that I could or would which sounds terrible i guess, but honest. I can remember back to us getting together senior year of highschool sitting up all night talking at Tom's house, going to the park..i remember the day he told me he got into temple and that he was going, i remember the day he said I love you.

"event","THEE most interesting weekend that i've had in a while. I'm not sure where to begin. how about the words: MOTHAFUCKER
I was looking forward to Hartford for a long while, i was really looking forward to just getting away. Nothing usually works out the way that it was planned, but that doesn't always mean that it has to be bad, well this time..uh yea
Got to Hartford after a 4hr ride and Carla felt really sick, the same sick that she felt earlier that morning. We had a Rusted ROot concert awaiting us, but she decided that she wasn't well enough to go. So she stayed at Sam's while me sam alex and dana went to the show. I felt really bad leaving her, but she said that there was nothing that I could do for her anyway. 
I have to say that the concert was FUCKIN awesome that was a really good part of this trip. Rusted Root put on such a good show, i did not expect it to be as good as it was. They did a little section of All Along the Watchtower and Very Superstitious which was really unexpected and well played.
So, we get back to Sam's and Carla is pretty much delirious she said she should be okay to fall asleep so we put on a movie and all went to bed.
Wake up the next morning really hoping to stay, but instead end up at St. Francis hospital in Hartford. Our parking garage ticket said Entry: 11:45 a.m. we left there at 8:30 p.m.! I have never spent so much fuckin time at a hospital in my entire life. (Oprah did have the cast of Seinfeld on which was a plus)It was really a horrid experience that i never want to think about again. We ended up leaving Hartford at 9 or so and got home close to 1. Carla feels better, it was some sort of stomach virus which should blow over soon.

"event","strange rap songs in my head. which is funny
Just woke up a couple of minutes ago from being fuckin' wasted last night which i didn't even notice until i layed down in bed (which always happens)
haven't brushed my teeth yet..ew, 
Even though we don't have off at all for this easter business i still feel like it's some sort of break this weekend..and kelly's parents are away and bridget is home which all adds to it.
I went to King of Prussia w/ Bridget yesterday, i had such a good time hangin out, i miss her and i can't wait until she is home all summer.
....random thoughts....
i've wanted to update so many times in the past couple of weeks, but for some reason or another did not and now i have loads of random thoughts
I'm not sure when I fell so hard all over again for Boris. I can't believe i was thinking about space during his road trip, i'm just gonna bum around and be real sad. 

I'm sure i'm not alone in this, but I look in the mirrow sometimes and think and have well convo's (sometimes..i'm not crazy dammit) And i'm not sure that i will ever find someone like boris, ever. I think about his personality traits and who he is and who he wants to be and it makes me very happy. 
When people are young(er) they count the time that they have been in their relationship- monthly anniversaries ect. (how many times they've banged eachother..hehhe) and i am guilty of the same, but somehow every month me and boris never remember the 25th it just gets passed over whether i write the date four times that day or something we just usually never remember and I LOVE THAT!...i think counting the time that you are together you are just counting the time until it's over. I know that we have been together almost 2 1/2 yrs.(roughly) and the time has flew by and it's been wonderful and that's all i care about not some dumb score board of how many 25 of the months we've had.
I'm really gonna miss him, he keeps me grounded..

or i can just elope with Carla which also makes sense to me..i've also decided that i've pretty much found my better half in her..it's sad when you know facts like how much gas is in the tank of someone else's car when you haven't been in it in like 5 days and they themselves don't even know

"event","I have to ask myself through muchos frustration if I am an angry person. I go back and forth and back and forth between smiles and laughs to anger and longing. I feel ungrateful for not enjoying this apartment and the good things. I feel it necessary to do things that I know are wrong. I rarely get excited anymore and I haven't drawn anything in two or so months. 

This weekend was pretty good even though i did a good amount of nothing.
Friday i sat around and later on my brother and his girlfriend came over, they brought a bottle and we sat around and chatted. A few hours after he got here mark came by which was a very pleasant visit. I love hanging out with mark when it's just a couple of people. And i'm looking forward to the plans that we made.
Saturday i went to the phila art museum in the morning and had a strange ride through university city followed by parts of west philly that i wasn't so sure i wanted to be driving through. Later that night Jess and Lauren came by and we went to this fantastic restaurant in University City called ""Bubble House"" it was like a Thai fusion place with the best dessert i've ever eaten. 
Then sunday came and i knew that stress was coming back into my life later that evening. And sure enough it did and soured the end of the weekend terribly. In addition to the horrendous movie i saw yesterday. But it was nice to spend some time with Boris. I guess that's pretty much it and it's snowing outside right now. ::fingers crossed for no math class tonight::"

i'm just tired..and i'm really sick of school..sometimes I sit in my classes and I have to literally sit there and remind myself..this is for your own good, this is for your own good. You know how it is said that ""college is not for everyone"" well i feel like maybe i'm one of those people just stuck in the ""this is really what you need to do it's for your own good and well frankly you have no choice"" (is that also a cliche) and it's not like i have no choice in terms of my parents it's that i have no choice in the goals i have set for myself which really doesn't make much sense and I understand this. right now the only class i enjoy is my Art History..well more than enjoy i just plain fucking love it, but sometimes like tonight when i have to study  my laziness takes over and i think to myself it would be easier to cheat then to memorize these dates and i have to ask myself how much respect do i really have for the topic or the class if i want to do that. I know i shouldn't make to much of an analyzation over all of this i mean people go through slumps and i have had many and will have many more.
anyway that's my current issue i guess."

I know i'll come here once in a while, but the majority of my time will be at home. Another dilema that I have is a job or lack there of. It seems that the only one I could find is well..contraversal..it seems that the art store in Newtown is opening up a figure drawing class and the only thing they are hiring for is models..(you can paint your own picture there..no pun intended) wow i'm really being cheesy today this is what my life has reduced me to puns and who wants to me a millionare.

I just want him to see that my brother and I will be okay. Hopefully this will give Max a push in the right direction. There is no one in this world more important to me than my brother and if for nothing else than this I want him to take that amazing brain that he has in his head and use it already. He's 25 yrs old..fuck. I don't update for weeks and when I do it's to bear bad news. At least things are falling into perspective. 
------Sometimes I see certain people that I haven't seen in a while and I look at them and i want to just scream out ""i understand"", but i never end up saying anything. Damn this is vague.

Friday we had a nitrous party at our apartment and it was to say the least--insane. Everyone i think had a really good time. Balloons everywhere. I don't know how soon we'll be doing that again, but i did have a blast. Then on saturday i'm sitting on my couch feeling pretty shit from the previous night and Jason calls Boris. He's like ""so when are you coming up"" and Boris says ""i dunno maybe next weekend...so jokinly i say how about tonight"" and Boris turns to me and he's like ""ya know why not"" so in the span of twenty minutes Boris checks the train schedule and i grab a shower and we are on our way to NYC. It was so spontaneous and I had a great night. Instead of going to sleep we caught a train at 5:14 a.m. out of PennStation because me and him both had to be back by 1 on sunday afternoon. So no sleep really and staying up all night, it was really exhausting, but no question worth it. I swear everytime i go up to NYU and hang out with those kids I ask myself why i don't transfer there. Everyone is amazing and so chill. Always really welcoming and so nice. We met this one kid from Oregon that made it sound like heaven on earth(sorry i know that was cheesy, but it fit) I really would like to go there, I mean i know it's not anykind of ""vacation spot"", but i think it sounds like a great time. I feel like I have a lot more to say and i can't think of any of it right now.

So i'm gonna do that with my parents today. 
The first week of school was pretty good I can already tell though that this is going to be a very difficult semester. A lot of work, which means that I can't work, which is going to be rough on the money situation. I mean i'll check it out and see what happens I've just been to busy to really do anything about a job yet. Over all i'm ridiculously happy with my roommates and things have been good.

Yesterday my roommates were all out and i made myself dinner cleaned up and smoked a cig it was the most rewarding feeling. ---------I slept at Boris's last night and i acctually missed my apartment ..i came back this morning and thought to myself..yep this is home.

I've been racking my brain lately trying to remember if my memories were dreams that I had within the last few nights or reality. I feel like if I ask someone i might get the ""what the fuck are you talking about"" 
AnYwAY..I am moving in three days and I have nothing done. I've gone to Target I've gone to the dollar store even Value City things were bought, but I can't seem to get my shit together I'm slacking (like right now for instance)
Yesterday was a great day. Although the movie me and boris saw kind of sucked ""we dont live here anymore"" was very dragged out and slow, but the acting i have to admit was great. We must have bought something food related about four times yesterday. Cosi,little asian woman stand,this OVER OVER OVER priced gelato place on 13th and Sansom (do not go there they say they are gelato artisans, but in reality they are gelato bandits) and then to Whole Foods for mine and Boris weirdo cravings. The shrimp was good though. After we watched a little t.v. we went to Jason's he just got back from the shore and had a bunch of people on his porch as always. I love those kids so much i'm really going to miss them ...never a dull time. Then i went home for some sleep and realized haha no more WORK...yippee. Okay I am going to go pack now..promise."

"event","The weekend was definetely better than the week. Although I couldn't go down the shore to visit Kara or Kevin it was still a nice time that got my mind off of things. My grandfather was released from the hospital yesterday which is good, he is driving my grandmother crazy which must mean he's feeling better. He's not going to celebrate his 75th birthday like he had planned to and that is really upsetting because it's a big birthday that absolutely should be celebrated, but he just isn't feeling well enough.
Yesterday was a really fun day. And as i was happy and content about to drive home I run into Kirby and Matt Hater at the Great American Pub which was random and even more random that I was with Evan and Zak who I really don't see that much and happen to be with whenever I see her. Evan had some choice lines of the evening...and we got to pick up a nice amount from Kyle and chill for a while. All and All a good day.
Boris and I are going downtown today to go to the Ritz to see a movie. And speaking of movies..it's official Garden State has become a cliche a fucking cliche and I'm not happy about it.. we may see Festival Express which is supposed to be good it's a documentary about Janis Joplin and the Greatful Dead. I really just want to get outside because it's gorgeous out!
----------------
In art news (and this is very disturbing) Two men stole Edward Munch's paintings ""The Scream"" and ""Madonna"" from the museum in Oslo they had guns and made everyone get on the floor as they walked out with both paintings. I really hope they catch these fuckers who think it's okay to steal art...bastards.
Everyone go outside =)"

"event","did you ever notice (or maybe it's just me)that when one bad thing happens it's like a door way for ever other bad thing to happen as well. Yesterday was probably one of the worst days ever. The day starts out normally...and I go to work and I'm bored as usual. First my mom calls because we had quite a big fight the day before and tells me in a mafia sort of way that she wants the car at her parking lot by monday with the keys on the seat and hangs up. So i call my dad because i'm really upset and i'm like what the fuck am i supposed to do about this? And it's noisy in the background and he's supposed to be at work so I ask-where are you? And I find out that he's in the hospital and has been since two in the morning the night before. My grandfather has internal bleeding and couldn't breathe so they rushed him to the hospital in the middle of the night and no one bothered to call me in the morning (i guess that's not really significant at this point) so my dad was there and my stupid car problem seemed like bullshit at that point. So i try to put all of this shit out of my head because Suzanne called me and was like..come over i haven't seen you in while. So i got directions, left work and went to her house. I stayed for a while and we talked a lot and she was like can I take your car out for a spin? I didn't see any harm in that so I go to grab my bag and she's like ""why are you taking your bag are you leaving soon?"" and i said no, not really and left it there. Blah blah blah basically she has a lot of siblings. And they aren't exactly moralistic kids. So when we took Jess out for her birthday I opened my wallet and saw that I had one 20 dollar bill in there instead of 3 of them. I got gas that morning and tapped mac so i would have money for dinner. I had two fives and three 20's in my wallet. So either money magically disapeared out of my wallet or something fucked up happened. The ONLY place that I was yesterday aside from work (where i never leave my desk or bag) was Suzanne's and unless Benji went into my wallet on the drive to Jess's (yea right) Suzanne's little brother or little sister decided to help themselves to my wallet which would have been quite easy considering I left my bag and wallet right on the couch. That might have been stupid, but come on who would think that something would happen to it. I mean i'm not the most trusting person, but leaving your bag in someone's house? Fuck. You know. So the day sucked a lot, i mean taking Jess out for her birthday was nice and it was nice to spend time with Lauren, Bridget and Jess. After dinner we drove to Jaimie's apartment in the city and we hung out there for a while and had a few beers. The part after the whole wallet thing wasn't to bad, but slowing my faith in things is getting less and less. 

I wish Boris didn't work so much and that Kara wasnn't down the shore..bleh."

"event","Well i'm glad that I waited until Monday morning and that I answered the phone call Linzy placed to me before I got into the parking lot at work to make an update. It's hard for me to put my feelings into words or onto paper (be it electronic or not, and it used to be a lot easier)I feel like i'm going to hurt someone no matter what I say. The couple of the weekend went from broken up to back together in the course of 24 hrs or so. And if that's something that they feel like they can do then good for them. I wish nothing but the best. I don't want anyone to be hurting or in pain, anyone that I know on a close level and when she called me on Saturday hysterical I couldn't help but feel a lot of pain for her and I was prepared to be the friend that she needed me to be and listening to her cry and the things that she was saying brought me back to a time I did not want to even remotely think about and have not thought about in a long while. I want her to understand that although we have been friends for the better part of my life and we've dealt with a lot of bullshit I'm not sure it is the kind of friendship I want to go back to. I tried to explain myself, but I don't really know what i'm trying to say. I don't trust her, and she sure as hell doesn't trust me nor do I blame her. Lies were told and well you know what I guess that's human nature. I feel like when I move into that apartment on August 26th i'm opening a new chapter in my life and I want to move forward not be kept in the past. For once in my life I acctually am looking forward to moving on and on and change and anything else that comes along with it. On Saturday morning when I was lounging around the house and no one was home I will admit that I missed our early morning/late night conversations with a cigarette in hand and an emotional conversation on the line. I felt like i had gone through a mini break up with a friend. People change and life moves on and I always come back to my cheesy beliefs in fate. And that's all i'm going to say on the topic."

"event","I've never been faced with this kind of dilemma before. I fucked up, and you fucked up, and now things are gonna get fucked up. It's really hard to realize and I mean really realize certain things about people. You may have always suspected it, but when you really figure it out you feel relief and you also feel anger. 
Everyone involved is going to get hurt here (some more than others)
A long time ago decisions were made and now I feel like a lot of people got hurt for no reason. Friendships were never the same after those moments and now I have to ask myself what was it all for? Safety? Comfort? Amusement? Was it worth it? On my end it wasn't, but maybe on your end it was...at least I hope so.

My pretty mouth will frame the phrases that will
Disprove your faith in man"

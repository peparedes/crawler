"event","so it turns out that noah indeed has FUS.  we went to the vet again yesterday and got him some meds.  these next couple of days are pretty critical.

my coworker sent me this <a href=""http://www.fluffytails.ca/boomer.asp"">story</a> about a cat with the same problem."

chinese new year is tomorrow.  that means we're going to have a big feast tonight for dinner.  tomorrow brings lots of red envelopes and a day of fasting (my family is vegetarian on new year's day).

hope the year of the ram brings everyone much luck, good health, and happiness!"

"event","yes! i got my super white prius from a <a href=""http://www.sftoyota.com"">great dealership</a> on geary last night.  my salesman was collin who used to be a cable car driver.  i highly recommend him because he treats his customers really well.

as for that other crap dealership, i posted a couple of reviews on <a href=""http://www.craigslist.org"">craigslist</a> and <a href=""http://www.ripoffreport.com"">ripoffreport</a>.  collin also said that toyota would give me a call soon after my purchase so i could tell them about what happened in daly city.  he had worked there for a day but quit on the spot because he disagreed with the way they did business.

my car is running great!  got around 40mpg this morning coming to work, and it was nice smooth ride."

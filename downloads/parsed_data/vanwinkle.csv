"event","If you'll just teach them to.  (Suddenly I'm reminded of Steve Martin's admonition to ""talk wrong"" around kids.)

Yesterday I came into the living room while the kids sat on the couch watching Looney Tunes, my hair mussed severely after a drenching in the sink. It's too long again, which greatly amplified its dramatic appearance. Not Einstein, but a worthy effort. I asked the kids if they liked my hair. Alexander looked and smiled and said, ""It's ug-ly!"" Angelina, though, in her thoughtful way, smiled at its comic appearance, then grinned--a small grin, more to herself for remembering--and said, ""It's a train wreck.""

Funny what makes one most proud. My influence grows stronger."

"event","It really is nice when the kids wake up in a good mood. They were unusually cheerful and polite this morning, which just started the day off on the right foot. It's so much nicer when we're all smiling and laughing!

I'm so glad that Clint didn't keep that StreetDelivery.com job -- he would have been bored to tears, and I don't want him to have to do something like that. I want him to have a job that he actually looks forward to doing! And if he can't have that right now, I at least want him to have a job that he doesn't dread. I wasn't really concerned about him finding something; I guess I'm just an optimist, but I knew something would come up. Something good -- maybe something great. And it has -- twice!

Of course, if we'd bothered to pay attention to Clint's horoscope we would have known that was going to happen:

AQUARIUS
February 4th - 10th, 2006

PROFESSIONAL LIFE: ***

A difficult decision has to be made, and you must choose between two very tempting options. Look at all the signs and you will see which one is best for you.

(Sometimes they're right.... Although, I suppose it isn't EXACTLY right, since he may not have to choose....)

I'm very excited about this real estate office position. That couple may be young, but they have a plan -- and they have their families behind them on it. I believe they're going to do exactly what they outlined for us this morning, and if they hire us they're going to take us along for the ride. Tammy really did seem to like the idea of hiring us as a team, especially since it's for the price of just one of us! (She especially seemed to like Clint's comment about the braintrust they'd be getting along with us; she really seemed to like it when I told her ""...if we don't know how to do something, we'll have somebody to call who can tell us."")

So I'm going to try not to think about all that anymore until we hear from Tammy on Monday. (Wish me luck -- I'll need it....) In the meantime, I'm going to cut Alexander's hair. (As I was tucking him in tonight he finally consented; he's decided that, instead of his usual cut, he wants his hair cut like Clint's.)

They're both crazy about him -- and I'm with them on that.

"event","This may be my last journal entry here.  It's not as if, of course, I've been a steady patron of these parts, with a solid following that will weep at my exit.  To say my posts have been infrequent would be an insult to ""infrequent.""  No, it's merely the observation that this may not be where I want to keep what I would call a journal.  I don't mind doing this, but ""this,"" to me, is a forum.  It is public and interactive--essentially a blog--whereas a journal as I consider it to be is a place to record one's private thoughts.  Yes, LiveJournals can be made private, but then why not just record them in, say, Microsoft Word?

That's not to say the forum doesn't have a place.  Indeed, I enjoy doing this.  I do like the interactivity, the sharing of information and resultant commentary.  That connection is fun and even thrilling at times.  But I want to keep a journal, too, and that's a private thing.  I think it may even need be an analog thing.  As a romantic traditionalist I'm a sucker for the pen and paper.  My father has recently unearthed a fountain pen he's had since college and is rediscovering the aesthetic thrill of the scratch and stroke.  I'm inclined to do the same, and as I'm sure that I don't at present have time to do both--keep a handwritten journal as well as an interactive forum--I believe I'll have to drop the curtain on this for a while.  And even then, when I am able, I believe it will be in the form of a website and blog.  If I'm going to have a personalized web presence, I'd rather go whole hog with it.

So, on that score, I guess I should bid my audience of at best two, usually one, adieu adieu a-dieu-u.  The ""usually one"" shares my bed, so it's not as if the separation will be all that substantive, and for my second, well, we still have e-mail, telephone, and getting together--gasp!--in person.  I think it will all work out in the end.

The End...."

"event","and we always do what we say we will, right?  In this case, journal.  About what, who knows.  I just need to drink enough water to compensate for the salty pizza I ate last night.  Today--what was today?  It was another day without work, for one.  I've strung too many of those in a row for my taste.  I was hoping still, even against my hunch, that I'd hear from a certain company today about a certain WiFi mapping job.  Didn't, but because I was already skeptical, not much of a loss, other than it would have been perfect for me right now.  So now I'm back, probably, to where I was, looking for another driving job or an office gig I'm not wild about.  But for whatever reason, at the moment I'm not terribly worried about it.  Maybe it's the music.  Or maybe I'm just tired of thinking about it.  Either way, I'm unmoved by it.

As for the rest of the day, Dave dropped the kids off this morning around nine, and Carole and I entertained them for the next six-and-change hours.  Their Christmas bounty still held their interest pretty well, as well as a third or fourth viewing of <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0129167/combined"">The Iron Giant,</a> a surprisingly good animated movie that deserved to do much better than it did.  (I believe it's been somewhat of a Shawshank, but I haven't confirmed this.  And it's not all that surprising it's good, considering <a href=""http://imdb.com/name/nm0083348/"">Brad Bird</a> made both films.)  Carole used her Mommy charms when those failed.  The emergency countermeasure, of course, is me.  Basically as long I'm willing to sacrifice my body to the whims of the children, bad moods and fussing can be largely avoided.  It's a very fortunate thing that I have no ego when it comes to kids these days.  I truly don't care what I look or sound like, which apparently scores lots of points with the under-six set.  I am the human Gumby.

A guy came to pick up the laptop computer desk that's been hoarding space in the too-small living room for months.  Got fifty bucks for it, thanks to Carole's ad posting yesterday.  Would've preferred the $70 we asked, but we more prefer cash-in-hand (or in Paypal) and the desk gone, so....

After Dave retrieved the kids we ate our very late lunches, Carole worked on the wedding website (which we finished; this definitely isn't my father's wedding, as he also pointed out), then she worked on Shana's bridesmaid dresses, I worked on finding a job (and/or some freelance work), and then we retired to the back half of <a href=""http://imdb.com/title/tt0120780/combined"">Out of Sight,</a> easily one of the best films of the Nineties and one of the best adaptations I've ever seen.  Love that movie.  And it's got my creative juices flowing again.  Probably won't do anything with the flow--well, besides writing this--but it's nice to feel them budge at least.  Too much going on of late for them to get much exercise.  It's okay, though; the things that are taking away from them should.  Some things in life just get priority, like having a job.

And now it's 12:45 a.m., which is ridiculous considering how badly behind I am on sleep.  So what am I doing here?  Nu-thin'.  Going to bed, actually.  And now I'm good for another nine months.  We'll see.  I'm making no resolutions."

IRAQ--LESSONS LEARNED [Rich Lowry ]
Here is a fascinating e-mail that is going the rounds in military circles. It is an account of a presentation given by one of the leaders of 1st Cav Div, just back from Iraq. I try to follow Iraq stuff pretty closely, but most of this I had never heard:

    1. While units of the Cav served all over Iraq, he spoke mostly of Baghdad and more specifically Sadr City, the big slum on the eastern side of the Tigris River. He pointed out that Baghdad is, in geography, is about the size of Austin. Austin has 600,000 to 700,000 people. Baghdad has 6 to7 million people.

    2. The Cav lost 28 main battle tanks. He said one of the big lessons learned is that, contrary to docterine going in, M1-A2s and Bradleys are needed, preferred and devastating in urban combat and he is going to make that point to the JCS next week while they are considering downsizing armor.

    3. He showed a graph of attacks in Sadr City by month. Last Aug-Sep they were getting up to 160 attacks per week. During the last three months, the graph had flatlined at below 5 to zero per week.

    4. His big point was not that they were ""winning battles"" to do this but that cleaning the place up, electricity, sewage, water were the key factors. He said yes they fought but after they started delivering services that the Iraqis in Sadr City had never had, the terrorist recruiting of 15 and 16 year olds came up empty.

    5. The electrical ""grid"" is a bad, deadly joke. Said that driving down the street in a Hummv with an antenna would short out a whole block of apt. buildings. People do their own wiring and it was not uncommon for early morning patrols would find one or two people lying dead in the street, having been electrocuted trying to re-wire their own homes.

    6. Said that not tending to a dead body in the Muslim culture never happens. On election day, after suicide bombers blew themselves up trying to take out polling places, voters would step up to the body lying there, spit on it, and move up in the line to vote.

    7. Pointed out that we all heard from the media about the 100 Iraqis killed as they were lined up to enlist in the police and security service. What the media didn't point out was that the next day there 300 lined up in the same place.

    8. Said bin Laden and Zarqawi made a HUGE mistake when bin laden went public with naming Zarqawi the ""prince"" of al Qaeda in Iraq. Said that what the Iraqis saw and heard was a Saudi telling a Jordanian that his job was to kill Iraqis. HUGE mistake. It was one of the biggest factors in getting Iraqis who were on the ""fence"" to jump off on the side of the coalition and the new gov't.

    9. Said the MSM was making a big, and wrong, deal out of the religious sects. Said Iraqis are incredibly nationalistic. They are Iraqis first and then say they are Muslim but the Shi'a - Sunni thing is just not that big a deal to them.

    10. After the election the Mayor of Baghdad told him that the people of the region (Middle East) are joyous and the governments are nervous.

    11. Said that he did not lose a single tanker truck carrying oil and gas over the roads of Iraq. Think about that. All the attacks we saw on TV with IEDs hitting trucks but he didn't lose one. Why? Army Aviation. Praised his air units and said they made the decision early on that every convoy would have helicopter air cover. Said aviators in that unit were hitting the 1,000 hour mark (sound familiar?). Said a convoy was supposed to head out but stopped at the gates of a compound on the command of an E6. He asked the SSG what the hold up was. E6 said, ""Air , sir."" He wondered what was wrong with the air, not realizing what the kid was talking about. Then the AH-64s showed up and the E6 said, ""That air sir."" And then moved out.

    12. Said one of the biggest problems was money and regs. There was a $77 million gap between the supplemental budget and what he needed in cash on the ground to get projects started. Said he spent most of his time trying to get money. Said he didn't do much as a ""combat commander"" because the war he was fighting was a war at the squad and platoon level. Said that his NCOs were winning the war and it was a sight to behold.

    13. Said that of all the money appropriated for Iraq, not a cent was earmarked for agriculture. Said that Iraq could feed itself completely and still have food for export but no one thought about it. Said the Cav started working with Texas A&M on ag projects and had special hybrid seeds sent to them through Jordan. TAM analyzed soil samples and worked out how and what to plant. Said he had an E7 from Belton, TX (just down the road from Ft. Hood) who was almost single-handedly rebuilding the ag industry in the Baghdad area.

    14. Said he could hire hundreds of Iraqis daily for $7 to $10 a day to work on sewer, electric, water projects, etc. but that the contracting rules from CONUS applied so he had to have $500,000 insurance policies in place in case the workers got hurt. Not kidding. The CONUS peacetime regs slowed everything down, even if they could eventually get waivers for the regs."

"event","He decided to write again.  Actually what I'd decided to do was start a blog, but I remembered I had this already, and it's free.  Blogger's free, sure, but from what I can tell, it's also cheap.  I'll go with Movable Type when I'm ready.  For now, I think this shall suffice.

Why now?  Eh.  Been approaching the idea for a while, it kept being turned away by the same thought: If I've got time to write in a journal, I've got time to be working on a script.  Or something else more crucial than this.  But you know, sometimes you just want to get a thought down.  That's usually been what e-mail's for, but I'd rather not restrict it as such.  The whole idea of e-mail is to share an experience or insight with a friend, whether you're looking for feedback or not.  So why limit myself to just one or two friends?  Of course it's largely, even primarily not even about that.  It's about putting my thoughts somewhere.  I'm not going to handwrite them.  Used to, for years, but as tactilely pleasurable as that it is, it's a pain in the hand.  I'm all about turning thoughts into words as quickly as I can, and I can type faster than I can write.  (Though considering my writing, you might not think it to see it.)

Anyway, there's the motivation behind the mystery.  I'm sure many were wondering...."

"event","I just had concluded -- it wasn't my doing; he bailed -- a week-long debate with a leftist by the name of Patrick Coony, editor of Newsbatch.com.  I'm a little disappointed by it, as I was eager to get his answers to the arguments I made in my last installment.  I'm not sure why I expected him to give any thorough explanation, though, considering he only circuitously answered any of my other questions.  And that's what bugs me the most.  Especially in the political sphere, where real people are affected by what you believe (through how you vote), merely saying ""We simply disagree"" isn't enough.  You need to be able to explain yourself, the premises for your beliefs, and be willing to do so when challenged.  If you really believe something to be true, if you're so convicted, explain yourself. Fight back.  I wish Patrick had.  If he had answers, why not answer?"

"event","Because, you know, it's almost over and gone.  Can't go back and do it again.  Or maybe I can.  Suddenly I'm seeing Red again.  The movie, that is.

I don't really feel like writing -- maybe it's the macaque in me -- but this caused a chuckle.  It's nice to know there are some people out there doing some real research.  I wonder what kind of message an Omega Code generator would find in this.

"event","I only met her twice.  The second time she was older, second or third grade, busy with a baseball or softball game.  She didn't remember me very well.  She was excused: The only other time I met her -- the first time -- she was only four or five.  But while she wasn't able to remember me so well, I remembered her.  She was the most adorable little girl I'd ever met.  The kind you wonder how her heart fits in her little chest.  I was rather ambivalent about children at that time, unsure if I wanted any of my own.  I was sure after Elizabeth.  We didn't get that much time to play together, honestly, which is why I was surprised by the earnest hug she gave me as we were leaving.  I didn't think such little arms could be that powerful.  It was the truest hug -- one of the best hugs -- I've ever received.  She just melted my heart.

There's construction on I-35 in Lancaster, TX, right now, as there is all over the Dallas/Fort Worth area.  And like many areas, it's narrowed down to two lanes.  As expected, it can make it pretty hairy during high traffic times.  It was that way this past Wednesday, November 13.  That was the day that yet another semi driver decided to drive his rig like a car and cut lanes.  (Although this one happened to have an outstanding traffic warrant, too, while driving for a company whose permit had been revoked.)  The semi tagged the back of an SUV heading from Austin to Arkansas for a funeral.  The 18-wheeler ran it into the concrete road divider then rolled over on top of it.

It took the rescue crews an hour to get the family out of the crushed SUV.  The father, mother, and oldest daughter miraculously survived with minor injuries.  They were released from the hospital that night.

They'll bury Elizabeth this week.  She was eleven.

I barely knew her.  I knew she wouldn't remember me.  And yet I fell in love a little with that little girl.  It would have been horrible losing her then.  But it's somehow worse now, harder to take, because she wasn't anymore merely a cute little girl whose spirit and smile lit you up inside.  She was eleven -- young enough still to shine with that light and innocence, but old enough to reveal the adult she was going to be, to hint at grown-up fantasies and dreams.  We should have gotten to know her as that girl, that woman, that wife, that mother.

To the man whose pitiful selfishness pinned a family in a smashed van for an hour with their youngest dead, you deserve to die.

"event","It's hanging around, in ways of which I wasn't aware.  (All that alliteration....)

Primarily I've realized a profound sense of peace that's settled over me the past couple of days.  I noticed it most today.  Granted, I was already in the most untroubled state of mind I've enjoyed in over a year, thanks to adjustments sought and unsought in the rest of my life.  What I'm feeling now, though, is something more.  Or less, as the case may be.  I'm not a mystical person, but the sense is one of having passed through something.

I think it may boil down to my being a sky junkie.  I've always felt more relaxed once I left the ground.  Every time Dad's taken us off, I can feel the world begin to slough off.  It's that detachment.  There's a magical point somewhere around 500-1000 feet where The Hubbub becomes merely objects on the ground and life begins to be something that happens below you.  You can't control it, obviously, but there's still a sense of godliness.  You're an Olympian watching over the hue and hustle of your puny human creations.  Or you can completely ignore them and look out at the blue and green.  While you're there, while you're up, all that matters is you and the sky and what you're doing there.

What's struck me mostly after the fact, too, is how truly bizarre an experience it was.  In the moment it is what it is, and you don't have much time for reflection.  But how sweetly odd it was to have such a sensation of normalcy -- standing there, swinging my legs, shooting the breeze (sorry) with someone -- in a supremely abnormal, unnatural position, hanging by straps 8000 feet above the earth.  I think at the time, too, it was too much for me to even register it.  I was too caught up being me, just at altitude.

This would be a decent place to segue into the observations I've had about the power of flight on political awareness, but it's already well past my bedtime, so it'll have to wait.  Besides, you've gotta have a reason to come back.  Keep them beggin' for more, after all."

"event","Well, ""fall"" is probably more accurate.  On the knees, head back, and rocking out into empty space, sunshine, and flapping cheeks.  In retrospect, the sensation is less one of falling than having the atmosphere roaring past you.  Not until you can see your shadow jogging toward you does the ground appear to ""rush up,"" and even then only as quickly as you want to meet it.  But between the roaring and the jogging is the hanging, the caught between earth and sky stillness.  It is you, and in a normal solo jump, I can't imagine a more striking sense of aloneness, but an expansive one.  A one-ness.  How remarkable.  I realize now I have to make a solo jump.  I have to know what that feels like, post-first-time, post-strapped-to-another-man's-chest-with-his-face-in-my-ear.  Yes, I have to jump again, and alone.

I've wanted to jump for years, probably since high school.  I just wanted to know what the experience was like, perhaps more than most people because I'm already used to being eight to ten thousand feet in the air.  Dad's a private pilot; I don't fly without looking out at the wing, down at the ground, without wondering about it.  Now I'll wonder know more.  I'll just want to do it again.

Why now?  Like I said, it was a nice day for it.  Or I knew it would be.  Friday was gorgeous, Saturday was supposed to be more of the same.  So I called Jason (who undoubtedly has his own post about this by now) and asked him if he'd like to jump out of a plane for his 29th birthday.  He said he'd be terrified, and sure.

So Saturday morning found us fifteen miles and several horse and cow pastures west of Denton, Texas, being fitted in orange jumpsuits with goggles and barf bags and watching the other orange jumpsuits disappear into the sky, only to be disgorged as dots high above us fifteen minutes later.  It's a strange sensation in and of itself.

How terrified Jason actually was, only he can say.  I could see a little trepidation, but he kept the extent well muffled.  In the last glimpse I caught of him as I was scooted toward the door I saw a brief flash of oh-mi-god, but he wants to solo jump himself now, too, so whatever he may have felt, it was reserved for the first jump.

As for me, for whatever reason, it was always just anticipation.  That I am used to being up no doubt accounts for some of it, but I think most of my lack of anxiety stemmed from my complete trust.  I had absolute no sense of danger, so my only anxiousness was to get to it.  I approached it as if it were merely an extreme roller coaster.  And that it was.  But SO much better.

Yeah, I'll be doing that again."

"event","A friend of mine mentioned a conversation she had with her professor.  He asked her if she'd voted yet and she said no, but what with him voting a straight Democratic ticket, their votes would just cancel each other out.  She said this as if it were a bad thing.  I pointed out to her that it's not.  You should vote even if it does only mean cancelling out someone else's opposite vote, because your guy wins by having the most left over.  In a two-way race especially, most votes are going to cancel each other out, but you have no way of knowing if your vote is merely cancelling someone else's out or putting your guy ahead.  They all count.  2000 showed us that in no uncertain terms.  And personally, I think next to this past presidential election, this is the most important election in which we've had the chance to vote.  What President Bush will be able to achieve in the last two years of his presidency -- and his ability to be re-elected -- is closely tied to getting the congressional support he needs."

"event","It's not often -- okay, it's never happened -- that I finish a book and see the film adaptation the same day.  Very interesting -- a little strange, in fact -- experience.

So I finished Thomas Harris' Red Dragon.  The ""double"" ending suffered for me not from any fault of logic in the book, but from the too many films I've seen in which the bad guy ISN'T REALLY DEAD AFTER ALL!  That said, I liked that Molly was forced to be Dolarhyde's executioner; that worked with the logic of the story and the characters very well.  The very end fell a little flat for me, too, in that Harris was trying to wrap it all up with a grand theme which for some reason didn't work for me.  I think it was a little too vague for me to be powerful.  He does better communicating theme through how his characters act and what they say.

But then there's the movie.  (If you haven't seen it and care about walking in a virgin, stop right here.)  As an adaptation, I think the director Ratner and writer Tally did a solid job.  Not nearly as good as was done for Manhunter, but as a stand-alone movie, better than average.  I recognize why for time compression certain parts of the book were left out or condensed, but I thought overall the film moved too quickly to achieve its principle goals, mainly expressing the frustration at figuring out Dolarhyde's m.o., and also catching Dolarhyde's crucial dichotomy.  I think changing Graham's personal dynamic with Molly and her son was a big mistake, too, though, because it helped as much as anything to define Graham's personality and situation.  (Plus it just set up even more the significance of Molly's actions at the very end regarding Dolarhyde.)

My biggest beef is with the casting, though.  Odd at first blush, I know, because it's obviously a great cast of actors, and ones I really like; I just didn't buy them in these particular roles (or at least with the direction they received from Ratner).  Most especially I didn't buy Norton as Graham, as I knew I wouldn't.  Norton always does at least a good job, but he wasn't old enough, damaged enough, or bitter enough to be Graham.  Graham is an old, tortured, moody soul and Norton is just too young and played him too eagerly for my taste.  William Peterson was just damn near perfect for that role in Manhunter.  (I should just say right here that everyone in Manhunter was better cast than anyone in Red Dragon, with the exception -- probably -- of Hopkins.)  Hopkins scaled down nicely from Hannibal, but he was still too aware that he was playing The Role.  Still a little too self-conscious and hammy for me.  I do think Ralph Fiennes was a damn good cast for Dolarhyde, and he plays it well, but I think he needed more time to develop than the movie allowed.  Plus, almost as important, he wasn't ugly enough.  Ultimately it's his facial disfigurement which puts him on his destructive path, and he has ... a bad scar on his lip.  I understood from the book that his nose was fucked up, too, and he'd had failed surgery using sixty-year-old techniques.  I mean, there's a reason the other kids called him ""cunt face"": His face is a hard thing to look at.  Fiennes wasn't hard to look at.  He just looked too pretty still in the movie for that to be the momentous, singular motivation it was supposed to be.  (Compared to Manhunter, though, which on this subject broke -- nay, achieved orbit -- from its almost obsessive faithfulness to the book, Red Dragon is the Word of God.)

As for the minor characters, Emily Watson did a good job as Reba, but they made the Reba character weaker than she was in the book, which hurt the story for me because it was largely that attitude that made her relationship with Dolarhyde possible.  She had attitude in the book that she lacked in the film.  (And a minor quibble: Someone needs to tell actors that blind people don't walk around looking perpetually amazed.)  The worst casting choice, though, in my opinion, was Philip Seymour Hoffman for Lounds.  I like Hoffman okay, but I thought he was completely wrong for Lounds not only physically but in demeanor as well.  Lounds in the book is an old, gruff, aggressively desperate almost con man, an irritating, insinuating firecracker, not the young, mumbling sloth as portayed by Hoffman.  As for Crawford, Keitel's too ... big, somehow, for that role.  Not subtle enough, I guess.  Crawford's a poker player of men; Keitel's ... well, he's a Bad Lieutenant.  Like Jason says, he's a tough guy.

So overall -- I am mixed.  It was a good movie -- I'd probably give it probably 7, maybe 6, out of 10 stars (following the IMDB system) -- but I'd have to say I'm a little disappointed in the adaptation. I just don't feel like it captured the spirit of the book or the characters nearly as well as it could have.  I can't stop thinking about who I would have chosen as a cast.  'Course, as I said, Manhunter was damn near perfect in that regard, so I guess I don't need to think about it.  Whew."

"event","As time falls back an hour, I post my first.  Seems fitting somehow.  It's too late and I'm too tired to analyze it.  But tonight's affair seemed a fitting first post.  (I've decided to let any background information on me trickle out as necessary.  No windy introductions here.)  (Whee, look at that; Windows just changed time for me.  Bill Gates is so powerful.)

So I bought a new leather jacket tonight.  Total impulse buy.  I mean, I need a new jacket since my good jean jacket fell victim to the battery acid in my trunk.  (Long story involving a car battery and a tote bag.)  Hit Mervyn's at Collin Creek Mall tonight with Jason to get some new jeans and wanted to find some nice boxer shorts, so we went to Dillard's.  Didn't find any boxers I wanted (certainly not for $16-20), but walking past the coat section I decided to check out their leathers.  I've never had a leather coat before, and I've always had a bear of a time finding the right kind of coat.  Well, there it was.  Second one I saw.  Picked it up, put it on, and Jason said, ""Wow.  That's really hip.  That's a Clint coat if I ever saw one.""  When I looked at it in the mirror, I saw how right he was.  It was meant to be.  So I fulfilled its destiny.  I love stuff like that.  I go for one thing, leave with something totally different.  Makes life interesting.

Funny, even though my clock's back to one o'clock, I feel just as sleepy.  I guess Bill Gates isn't that powerful after all."

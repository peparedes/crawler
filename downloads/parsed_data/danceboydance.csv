"event","So I got a little more drunk than I thought I would last night. Connor wasn't feeling well so he only had a little to drink, but he stayed the whole night. 
Zoe drank a 40 and smoked a little. I drank...1.5 40s, the half of one wasn't even mine, I think. I bought 2 40s and gave one to Maxime. 

Last night was such a good night. I fucked up my headphones somehow. I can remember the night, but not anything specific about it. I couldn't walk very well....at all. Rocco and Maxime were helping me walk from the park to Dana's house by holding my hand and my waist, just keeping me from tripping. I had some good talks with Maxime. It wasn't like at school where we just say a couple things, it was talking, laughing, sharing stories and opinions. I don't really care that we didn't ""hook up"" like Zoe was talking about. It doesn't matter to me anymore. As long as we talked and we at least had a conversation, I'm fine with it. I just want to be his friend.

I don't know. It was just a really good night. We didn't do anything stupid, either. Just went to the park, got our alcohol, drank some, walked around, drank the rest, went to Dana's house and hung out. Kevin invited me to start doing this every weekend and I am so down. The drinking part doesn't even factor in, it's the fact that we're friends and we're all together having a blast, walking the streets and just being teenagers.

EDIT:
reading this, it's not really truthful. It's hard to explain.
this version is kind of white washed and basic.
i was really fucking drunk."

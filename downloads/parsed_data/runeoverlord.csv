"event","Woweee. A lot has happened since I last posted. ooheee
Where to begin? 
Well i had two girlfirends since i last posted, both have dumped me. Oh well.

AND on friday i got attacked by neds!! I did nothing to antagonize them all night! One guy walked up an alley i was coming down and threw a bottle at me!! SCAREEEE! and then proceeded to punch me A LOT. The rest of his ""KREW"" came round the corner and the leader hit me four times for good measure when the other guy was nursing a hand in jury (MI HEAD DID THAT! HURHUR). So i got hit on the nose a lot and on the jaws and ears. I did not hit back becasue the rest of the group (about 20 odd) wouldve jumped on me. And my friends were in the crowd that gathered so they wouldve been sluaghtered. I stod there for ages taking hits trying to walk away. But the big bastard kept knocking my board out of my hand.
I got away eventually and hid in the Co-op cause i heard some crazy guy with a baseball bat was about, incidentally, he hit the guy that was punchin me in the stomach with his bat. Well thats what i heard anyway! HAHAAH THATS WHAT I CALL KARMA!
I got home eventually. and loked in them mirror, fearing the worst, and to my surprise.... there were no bruises or marks, just a slight reddening of the skin. How I laughed.
I cant wait to go to school tomorrow, (with my rather fetching new haircut *BLURGH*) because all the neds wil have think they did some damage to me! and they havent! heehee

they'll start to question their own strength and hopefully turn on each other! hehee"

"event","Egads. Just got back from Aberdeen. I bought a Jack Sparrow(Pirates of the Caribbean) figure and a Jack Skelington (Nightmare Before Christmas) figure. YAY!! I've already got two reservoir dogs ones (Mr. Blonde and Mr. Pink) and a Soul Caliber II one (Nightmare).
Had fun. Ate a cheese sandwich from O'Briens, was very good.

I just realized I missed out on sex. Fucking hell. I thought I didn't like the girl but I do and she was quite obviously up for it. That's me for you. Always wanting a relationship. It probably would have done me good. Oh well...

Back to school the morrow. Physics first thing. JOY.
Time for some bassing. Later kids."

<P>Yesterday, I went into Aberdeen with Katie. Had GREAT fun! I kept on yelling at minis and spinning a rolled up poster at pideons. Then we went to Starbucks and decided to be all cosmopolitan. Hehe. We went into a comic book store and it was pretty cool. It had all these action figures. It even had Nightmare Before Christmas ones. I got annoyed cos they were a tenner and I had just spent a tenner on crap. Also there was a Yagyu Jubei (Onimusha 2) figure, so I almost cried. I had a great time, went back to hers and watched Bill Bailey Part Troll for the fifth time (still funny to the point of tears). And watched the new Peter Pan film (was alright) Didn't get back home till about 12 at night. YAY!</P>
<P>I had to cut the fucking hedge today. Borrring. I've got stings all over my arms fom the sap in the hedges. Grr! Got 20 squid for it though. Hehe.</P>
<P>Oh well. That's life!</P>"

"event","Just recovered from a party, so I'm back online!!!
I can't remember much about it except pulling this really hot girl called Kirsty, pulling wheelies on a wheelchair (don't ask) and getting angry (again, don't ask). It was fun but Kirsty (another one, not the hot one) broke her pinky promise with me to stop grass. Silly bint. 
We played ouija board a total of three times, it worked every time. Even though I told my age old ghost story of a Ouija board gone wrong they still insisted so I joined in to make sure they did it right.
It wasn't even scary anymore. One of the spirits we contacted said that his name was owen and he was pennys guardian angel. OOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!
Better tahn the one I contacted on my first try at a Ouija board.

I was pissed off at my mate Innes but he came over and apologised, so all is well. He had girl problems.
We walked about Edzell today for about 2 hours yelling at Minis. ""The New ones are SHIT!!"" ""We want the old italian job ones!!"" ""MINI COOPER!!!!"" ""FUCKING NEW MINIS!!"" Fun in a basket.

Now I'm gonna phone Katie up, cos we are going into Aberdeen tommorrow and I can't remember what time she said to pick her up. EEEYAR. The curse of drink!

Ryan out."

Still don't know how to break the ""news"" to her. Well, I get some of the right signs from her but...girls are so goddamn complicated! Even though I have more female friends than male, I still ahve no idea what makes them tick!

Well this party should be an opportunity for some mindless fun before I take the plunge into rejection and quite possibly loose a friend that has been there for me when others haven't. HOW FUN!
Well, I'm trying to get things going by organizing visits to her house and taking her to Dundee etc.
I hope for the best. And the best is not what i'm gonna get in all probability.

I've had a pretty shitty couple of months. Three breakups since January. Ouch!
Well, I'm on the rebound again I hope! This time its someone i've overlooked for a very long time.
Dunno how to break the news of my undying love and affection for her but I'll try my best!

I FUCKING HATE BEING SINGLE!!!!!!!

Ahh, on that note I hope my mate (my good mate) Tom, does ok in his next bash at a relationship!
Im gonna go see him in the next year. Its a long time, but plenty to build up trust with my parents and travel the 200 odd miles to Northwich. On a train! I LOVE TRAINS! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeya!
Hmm, Im trying for the next summer holiday. But it may have to wait til the summer holiday that I'm 16.
A quote from a song comes to mind (Oasis I think) ""My body is young, but my mind is old""
Too true, why wont my parents trust me. I can go to Aberdeen unscathed! CHRIST!

Time for some personality tests and stuff. I'll keep whoever you are posted!"

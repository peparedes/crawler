"event","<font face=""Times New Roman"">Which is public, too~ :D

<lj-cut text=""Wish List Meme~""><i>STEP ONE
Make a post (public, friends-locked, filtered...whatever you're comfortable with) to your LJ. The post should contain your list of 10 holiday wishes. The wishes can be anything at all, from simple and fandom-related (""I'd love a ______ icon that's just for me"") to medium (""I wish for _____ on DVD"") to really big (""all I want for christmas is a new car/computer/house/TV.""). The important thing is, make sure these wishes are things you really, truly want.

If you wish for real life things (not fics or icons), make sure you include some sort of contact info in your post, whether it's your address or just your email address where Santa (or one of his elves) could get in touch with you.

Also, make sure you post some version of these guidelines in your LJ or link to this post so that the holiday joy will spread.

STEP TWO
Surf around your friends list (or friends' friends, or just random journals) to see who has posted their list. and now here's the important part:

If you see a wish you can grant, and it's in your heart to do so, make someone's wish come true. Sometimes someone's trash is another's treasure, and if you have a leather jacket you don't want or a gift certificate you won't use -- do it.

You need not spend money on these wishes unless you want to. The point isn't to put people out, it's to provide everyone a chance to be someone else's holiday elf -- to spread the joy. Gifts can be made anonymously or not -- it's your call.

There are no rules with this project, no guarantees, and no strings attached. Give, and you might receive. and you'll have the joy of knowing you made someone's holiday special.</i>



1. I love letters, postcards, cards, little things like that. They're great to have and I always keep every letter and such that I get. 

2. I'm an accessory freak. From hats/bandanas to bracelets, necklaces and earrings. I like them in all styles, shapes, and colours. Anything of that would make me dorkishly ecstatic.

3. Fanfiction/fanart of my OTPs throughout fandom. &hearts;

4. Music. You can't go wrong with music. I'd love mixed collections of songs to listen to.

5. I'd love <a href=""http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/(mint)/detailview.html?KEY=SFBD-3"">these</a> <a href=""http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/(mint)/detailview.html?KEY=SFBD-6"">two</a> DVDs, please.

6. <a href=""http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/(mint)/detailview.html?KEY=2006CL-151"">Tenipuri 2006 Calender omg.</a>

7. Anything butterfly related. I am <b>obsessed</b> with butterflies.

8. Being with my friends. All together. Somehow. 

9. Money. As much as I hate it. I'd like to have money.

10. If and when Dir en Grey tours America, a ticket to see them FIRST THING. &hearts;</lj-cut>"

"event","<font face=""Times New Roman"">.. because we all know the world ends when someone gets a file before everyone else.

Fangirling (bonus points if under a cut) = shoving ""AHAHAHA I GOT IT FIRST AND YOU DON'T"" into other people's faces.

Not Sharing File From Someone Else's Server = ELITIST BITCH OMG.

Lacking patience = FULL RIGHTS to attack someone else.

Combination of this = So horribly complicated and omg you're selfish and such and I'm confused ohnoes it's still not fair but I still wanna be your friend and fangirl that's okay amirite??

The internet is serious business, people. :: sage nod. ::

Honestly, bitches, <i>please.</i>

AND TO BE MORE SPECIFIC: I don't follow Tenimyu as much as I used to, but I'm still a fan of it as everyone else. Christ, the DL2!drama all over the place is pitiful. From what I've noticed, there's torrents, YSI links, direct links popping up all over the place for everyone. Was it really so hard to wait a day or so? Did you <i>really</i> have a need to gnaw on people's asses because you didn't happen to have it?

Seriously, it's available. And don't give out bullshit about how it's not easily available. You wanna buy it/bought it, go right ahead. You wanna download it, good for you. But it's NOT impossible to find and if it's not there today it's gunna be there tomorrow. So perching on the highest branch preaching about how people are selfish for not sharing it is really stupid. YOU WILL GET IT. Somehow. Someway. It's not going to kill you to <b>wait.</b>

The only ways it'll probably kill you is if your lungs explode from all the hot air you're blowing harping on and on and on about the stupid drama, or if you suffer a heart attack from the immense cause of fangirling you're doing to accomplish this.

So take a deep breath, monitor your blood pressure, and get over it. You'll live.

And if you don't think you can survive, I'll give you all ropes to hang your typing fingers from. &hearts;"

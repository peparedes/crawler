"event","Dude i dont know anymore...   I like Jess, even though her and alex just broke up.  Thats cool she told Matt that she liked me and whatever.. And that she could see herself going out with me but i guess she changed her mind, or maybe becasue i was there for her right after Cosner that maybe i was just a rebound...        But thats cool, Anywho even though she totally lead me on, She likes one of my very good friends Zach....  Only problem is he doesnt like her casue hes currently talking to someone else. But you know what Zach is a good guy and he does deserve happiness above anyone else i know.  Even above me..  Not like Jess liked me anyway i dont know why i cared so much about her...  I mean jesus christ...  she beats me up all the time, calls me names, destorys what little self-confidnece i did have...  

So on top of being destoyred psyhcially and mentally, i was a rebound.  Dude i feel great. And i told the only girl who actully liked me, Emily to leave me alone so i could be alone in peace with Jess...


LOL i knew this shit would happen, it always does....   Im never liked, im always the guy they can run to knowing full on i dont want anything in exchange for helping them pick up the peices when some asshole rippes them aprt...      i just dont get why they keep going after assholes knowing that they could have me in a heart beat....."

"event","Well ,its been foreversince the last update...    So here we go, Matt and Monica do infact go out and im totally ok with it casue like i told you, Matts a happy man! Theyve been going out for a while since i think it was 5/5/05..   :) Kinda hard to forget

   But today me and him got into a fight, casue i was talking about the new Jet Li movie in lunch today and He sat there and listened to me go on and on about it..  Then when Eric broke in and was like ""I hate it when people ruin the movie for other people by TELLING THEM"" i was like, ok ill stop thats cool...   But then matt went on about how he hated me telling him the movie...  and he always tells me to stop but i keep going on about it...   Well, he sat there at the lunch table and was listening to me until Eric said something...   and all sunday he didnt say a word either...  so i dont fuckin get it...  So i got pissed off, just closed my mouth...    And matt kept on asking me what was wrong, why i was pissed off, and when id go to say something hed start up a new sentence...   So i couldnt get a word out to explain why i was angry, so i exploded...  He just grabbed his books and left..  And hasnt spoken to me since..   Thats cool, its his right to be pissed, but it is also my right to be pissed too, that shit gets annyoing.. I mean it was ok i was giving away the movie, but to go on and on about how stuipd i was for doing that, and how many times he told me to shut up, and making me feel so small, and acutlly hurting my feelings...  I coudlnt take it, so i exploloed...  and i dont care if he ever talks to me again..  casue i dont need someone to hurt me all the time... 


Anyway, me and Emily Radcliff go out now, and i see a long term relationship finally, ive gone through so many girls that didnt last this long, and i think theres something here, Ive got invest in this... 


Everything else is fine..."

I tryed to send this to some people but i need to be linked up on AIM so fuck it i post in here...
Not much has been going on... I turn 16 tommorw at 10:12am  :)  Not gonna be in school casue its my fuckin birthday matts coming over and so is liz hopefully and were gonna watch movies :)   

Monica, ... ...   I really do not think she likes me... Matt swears she does, but when im in the same room as her i get this feeling that the ony reason she puts up with me coming over is becasue she likes matt...  And it isnt a problem that she likes matt over me casue that means hes gonna be a happy man! But i mean. why'd she have to lead me on? Just tell me from the begging that she didnt like me,maybe im just reading everything wrong and she does like me its just i cant see it....  Which i dont think is the case...  But she did just break up with chuck...    But then why would she flirt shamlessly infront of me with matt?   The only reason is becasie she likes him and shes useing me as a reason to talk with him?   Or im just being stuipd...

Poor Trish :( Eric and her anret talking anymore... Shes pretty upset about it but more angry then upset... Cause shes mad she lost someone imporant to her...  But she said her decion is to not tlak to eric and thats wut shes gonna stick too i guess....

Alex Cosnar told me that from his stand point that he thinks she likes me its just that i like her too much and i cant see it...  But i doubt thats true casue i dont care if she likes me now, It just dosent matter anymore...  Casue i dont care! I like someone else now and if shes got the sudden feeling that she lieks me i dont want to know aobut it... Casue she had ALOT of time to like me and go out with me but she didnt want too, she wanted to flirt with matt right in front of me.. Thats cool... Oh well, if she wants to be friends thats cool...

Goodnight guys"

"event","My weekend was good. Friday i had Mikey Bell and Alex Cosner over my house for Airsoft but it ended up not happening becasue we didnt have enough guns after Paul got there...  So we just sat around and talked about theories of our Universe and Paul spoke to jade for me, Now shes over me in a matter of 3 and a half seconds..  Which isnt bad, Its just that now i feel very alone.. And it doesnt help when the girl i like doesnt like me or cant show she does casue shes alrdy got a boyfriend...So i like a girl that alrdy has a man, which in-itself is werid..  But i like her alot and have liked her for a long time..

Saturday, Monica called me out of the blue and asked if me and Matt could go over to her house... Well i alrdy had Alex and Mikey over so i said to her that i had to wait for mikey and alex to leave then me and matt would be over..   I found out later on after matt had got off the phone with her.. That she said there were two reasons for her wanting us to come over.. 1. Was that she wanted Matt and Emma to start talking again, and Matt really didnt want to so it was a battle to even get him to go over there... and 2.Monica apprently said ( Now i dont and still do not belive this was said but Matt swears that it was) that she wanted to see me...  :)! But i doubt it was really said...   And even if it was i think that maybe she didnt even really mean me... She prolly meant Matt anyway.. Casue come on whod like me... ?  Other than Liz and Jade and Kelsey.. I got no one...   not even Jade anymore, But thats not a probelm...


Then Today i was soppsed to go to Monicas game... Me and Matt were gonig to her game to make her happy casue her boyfriend now doesnt even go over her house on the weekends...  So her game was 16 min. ago. So maybe now im going tover to Mollys house and hang out with Sarah and Moly and Liz and Caleb..  :)  Sounds like a good time in the making :)

Later guys

"event","The only reason i ""acted like Stephen"" was becasue you came into my room saying your internet was down so you turn off my transformer, casuing everything in my room to turn off. And leaving me to reset everything...   Then my norton anti-virus wouldnt turn back on, and my zonealarm was all kinds of fucked up casue of you turning off my transformer and crashing my shit...   So yea, i  was a little pissed...  Doesnt mean im stephen... I could be a bitch about it and be like ""YO WHY YOU TYPEING SHIT ABOUT ME YO"" But i wont casue im not stephen...  Just stop typeing shit about me...    If youve got a problem just try to come talk to me...    rather then bitching about it in the livejournal commuinty....   Id rather you tell me you got a problem with me then go tell all your friends first then come to me...   

Seems better that way...   Dont you think fag?   :)

Love you Danny,

"event","Im feeling depressed....   For one, Jade will not get over, she is like refusing the urge to get over me... It hurts her less to just get over me casue im not looking for a girlfriend...  But just becasue im not looking for a girlfrien doesnt mean i cant have crushs does it? Casue i definlty have like 2 crushs...

But anyway... Today i was in wellness walking and Danielle and Christina are talking about Ron, Chrissy's ex and i was in front of them all...  So i was walking along with my headphones in and im just midning my own bee's wax when dani hits my hair..  :) Im like ""Wth..."" so i turn around and all i see is her amazing smile... And she points over to Chrissy.. LoL So i turn back around and take off my headphones.. So we start talking about Ron and how guys are dicks... I defened us good guys like Corey,Matt and myself TOOTH AND NAIL!!  But they are convinced that every guy in the world is a dick in their own special way...  

But as we were walking i started to walk with my head down to listen better, and consitrate more on the converstaion... So im sitting there listening to wut happened to dani and her ex boyfriend, and i alrdy know wut happened with chrissy and ron.. So im sitting here soaking up wut happend. He cheated on her, and thought she wouldnt notice... And a whole bunch more stuff and shize like that..  But...  Then she told chrissy something that really hurt me and made me very depressed........    She was like ""Im not looking for anyone in this school, they're all immature, im going older, the only guy i like was a GI that got shipped out..."" Im like...  ""Why would she say that around me.....""  oh yea thats right IM A PUSSY AND NEVER TOLD HER I HAD A CRUSH ON HER!!!!  

So i turn on my CD player and put my headphones on, Then calmy started speeding up and later on i got really far ahead on them...  And then i started to think about it... And i ran some situations through mey head and i came out with, If i got her my number and she started to come over shed change her mind about every guy in this school is immature... But i couldnt just do that out of the blue, so i ran the situation of doing it through scool in my head...  and that came out with her laughing at me bacially and crushing everything i had for her... Basically she was like ""Hunny i think im a little to old for you... Go find someone your own age...""  And that hurts even thinkg about it.. So im not risking anything ill just get over it silently and be her friend if she still wants to talk to me..

And to top those things off, I still like Monica! WHICH isnt good casue shes got a boyfriend, but its cool casue i know she wouldnt cheat on him and i know she doesnt like me.. Which makes me 0 for 2.. Self Esteem on a scale of 1 to 10 is a resounding -65218414564854848   ....

The only people who are there for me to vent are people who like me.. Ive never vented to a guy for appernt reasons and only vented to 2 girls and both of which like me... Liz and Kelsey...  But then theres leesa and shes been there when ive vented but i never really put it all on her like i did Kelsey or Liz...

Justins a lucky guy

I need to a girl in mind and go after her...  Im tired of worrying if im steping on someone foot...  I really am...  I liked 2 girls and both of which do not like me...  Maybe i should go for this one in mind, if i work alot harder on her maybe shell like me, and she lives near me too!!  OOO  Maybe i should do that...  

""Should i put up my shining armor?
And put on the pimp shoes?
Or should i keep on the armor, just to kill the glow""

Later,
Matt"

"event","Im glad no one took my test....    DICKS!!!  But its cool i guess...   Anyway, not much has happened over my spring break....

The first couple of days we were off Matt spent the night, and we played Onimusha 3, Demon Seige or however you spell it....  Then on Friday he went to work so i was home alone, and monica out of the blue IM'ed me... She was like ""Hey, Matt told me to IM you, so wuts up"" and i was like ""Oh alright well i guess he wanted to know if we could come over..."" and then it went from there, I think we went over he house twice over spring break...   But both times it was fun..  :)  And then me and Liz made up, and weve been talking again...  Alot....  I never quite got how cool it was talking to her again...  I mean i know i liked it before, But i mean i didnt know i missed it until i got it back...   Its cool....  :)  But today at like 630 monica was like ""you guys should come to my game at 8""  and i had to go home and do some stuff and make sure it was cool with my mom and shit, but then when monica called me and i didnt have an answer to if i could come to the game yet so i told i couldnt.... But i definelty could and that kinda pissed me off.... 

So...  No airsoft or anything... Only a few girls that spoke to me...   I wish that Monica liked me.. At all....   But i mean if she doesnt then all i can just stay around till she likes me..."

"event","Your label is the Nice girl/guy. You tend to care for others over yourself. However, many people appreciate your caring side and would rather stick by you than hurt you. But, there is a downside. Some tend to abuse your kindness and take advantage of you. You always try to see the good in everyone and try not to hate. Also, you have sharp insight and a great personality. Calm, serene, and understanding, you make a worthy friend and a valuble ally to people in need. Don't change your sweet nature, your constant being-there can save a life. 
I suggest your go into a field that centers around working with others such as a doctor, baby-sitter, psychologist, lifeguard, or Teacher. If none of these occupations interest you, it is okay then. I am sure that there are plenty of oppertunities out there for you.

"event","Well...  Its been a while...  Yesterday was Jayme's birthday party.. But it wasnt so much a party rather than a get-together... There were like 6 people there, Krista her little sister and her boyfriend, Vince, my old bestfriend, then Me and Matt, and Heather, Jayme's bestfriend...  Everything was going good...  The way i remeber it Heather was a bitch but when i got into the car she was really nice.. So i made alot of jokes and was being cool and so was Matt we were being oursleves... Everyone was having a great time...  Then we got home and everyone was having a good time, until Heather let it get to her that her boyfriend wasnt calling her...  So when she left Jayme's room and went into the basement, i had to make sure she was alright casue matt and jayme didnt want too...  So i went downstairs to see wut was wrong..  I sat on the bottom 2 steps and she sat on the...  ummm.... how do you spell this fuckin word.. foo-ton..  dunno or care..  so i cleared my throat and she said ""I know your there, im not stuipd"" and i said ""No one said you were stuipd.."" So then she looked over at the stairs and said..  ""I like how my best friend came with you.."" and i said ""she didnt.."" and she said ""I know i was being sarcastic"" Everyone knows i can take a joke and she didnt mean it to be sarcasticly funny, she was hinting on me to leave her alone...  So i sat there and exmanied the sitaution..  I came downstairs to help someone with a problem, someone i thought to be my friend, and she either didnt want my help or she just didnt like me enough as a friend to even think to talk to me.. Both of which hurt... So i just sat up after the examniation was down and said ""oh, well then ill go get her for you..."" and she said something along the lines of ""I dont want to talk to her.."" But i just kept on walking... The whole rest of the day i was upset towards Heather...  She kept on being moody and i just kept on getting hurt whenever i would get over it and try to help her again...  Like the one time me and Vince were playing pool and we were laughing and having a great time... I went over and threw some streamer on heather and my myself, and she just took it off and tore it up and kept playing super nintendo....  i try to cheer her up and she gets mad and doesnt want to have fun... So we leave to go to Krista's lacross game, me and Matt go to see my old neigborhood and Jayme and Heather go inside to the game, me and Matt are having fun seeing some of my old friends.. We got into the car with Heather and Jayme and shes pissed again...  So when we get home me and Heather get into a fight casue she told me not to be sarcastic...   LoL, First off never tell me to do anything unless i hold you at some kind of respect.. second never tell me NOT to be sarcastic and expect me to listen, i cant not be sarcastic, and if u jump ill lay down... So i told her to shut the fuck up, i just had it with her, ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!""
So she stormed out and came back in the kitchen and threathen to beat my ass...  This is the same girl i had across my back and threw onto a couch.. She weights like 40 pounds but shes gonna fuckin slap the shit out of me...  So i was like ""OH YEA!? WELL, ILL SHAKE THE SHIT RIGHT OUT OF YOU, BITCH!"" She didnt like that very much..  so other than Heather, the get-together was a good time, i liked it...

But i feel bad at the same time casue i only made things worse for her, plus she drove us down there and she set up the party for jayme... So i was going to have jayme say sry to her but i didnt get to becasue i was too pissed off at her to even relay that message... Then as were about to leave i realize something... My jacket is in her trunk along with matts irish hat and and his name tag for work...  Shit...


But anyway about things up here, Me and Liz broke up like i think a week ago, tuesday, Me and her are talking though were on good speaking terms, and me and Jade are talking again, i think she likes me still.. it might be just a hunch but i think its right...  But, i dont know if i am going back out with her cause if i cheated on her one time wuts to say i wouldnt do it again, and i know its a thing of self-control.. And for you people who me, id rather not risk it if i think something like that might happen again, some might say thats bullshit, but i just dont trust myself yet...

I think i might have new crush, But i dont think i should just yet casue alot of girls who still like me read this, and they might say something to that girl that woudl ruin it... So ill leave her name as HER, For anyone of my guy friend just ask me and ill let you know her name..  But she is really cool, i spoekn with her like 3 times, and it was all peroid long...  I lent her my hoodie one class peroid and i was freezing my ass off talking with her, but i couldnt let her know that so i just kinda walk alongside of her saying ""Uh huh, yea""  But shes really cool, and i think i do have a crush on her cause i look forward to seeing her and talking to her... Shes making me like school all over again...  LoL

My grades werent all that fucked up, i think im doing good but i need to bring up my World History grade... And keep all the rest up...  

""I trust this unconditionally, it tightens the knot in my stomach, it is truely beautiful in my eyes. I am falling in love with the unknown""-Unknowen

Well, After about 4 days of me posting that last entry me and ajde starting to work alot of things out and it got down to the point were she told me wut had happened...  She broke up with me a week after we started going out, on Matt's birthday... 2 days after we broke up she said yes to going out with Richie... So bascially she broke up with me to go out with Richie..  And for some really strange reason im wasnt all that mad...  So then she went on to tell they went out for about 2 weeks..  then about 5 days after i started talking to her again she told me they had broken up for about 5 days now and thats why she didnt want to go back out with me... Casue she didnt want to have her cousin al;l her friends down there hate her for having broken up with Richie and then staright after that have me again.. Whcihc pissed me off casue she didnt care about my friends down here or me for that matter but anyway.. She told me that i won her heart... That she realized she liekd me a whole lot more then she liked Richie, she liked me for my personality, my heart, and id like to think casue of my charm... but she told me looks and thats totally false... So after that she told me she didnt want to have another best-friend/boyfriend relationships becasue the last one hurt her alot. Well the last one was a guy who went around school telling everyone about wut her got her to do for him and about all her secrets she had confided to him...  We ALL know i wouldnt do ANYTHING like that shit....  But in the end Matt yelling at her finally got to her, she didnt know why she wasnt going out with me... All the elements were there..  She liked me, she couldnt stop thinking of me, and she wasnt trying to get any other guy in my place, ...  ...  ... Hence why we go out now :)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   :)

Anyway...  Ive got to bring up my grades in 3 classes...  World History, i am a genuis in history but i dont do the homeworks so im failing that class...  Architural Desgin and Drafting, i dont give a rats ass for this class....   and Biology, Ive got to start doing better in this class or im in trouble of failing....    Ive got 2 essays due monday and ive got the roughs complete ive just got to type it and thought id get my fingures warmed up before i got down to busniess...  plus i gotta take a shit...

Well, ALex Conser got me into 2 new things and one of which was succesful with all of my friends... Alex finally got me to see Boondock Saints.. OH MY FUCKIN GOD thats movie is so fuckin good!! Its bascially about 2 Irish brothers who kinda fall into murder as a profession"

"event","Well...  I dont rly know wuts been going on around in my life latey...   Jade broke up with me 2 weeks ago tommorw becasue she likes both me and this other guy named Richie... I dont rly like not going out with jade casue she keeps somehow bringing up Richie and then when i bring up EVER going back out she always gives me some kinda of half assed asnwer or something along the lines of ""I love you like a brother, Matt"" Well if jade kisses her brothers, im not so sure id like to be her friend anymore...

Oh man, this could be wrong on so many different levels but,  ...  ...   ...  I think i like one of jades friends now....  her name is Renea...  i pretty sure thats how u spell it, unless its Renee, either way i know i got my point across...  Then theres always been Arien... But im not so sure... that if i go out with her then i might lose Renea's eye and i KNOW ill lose jades which wouldnt be so much of a problem, except that jade would probably never want to talk to me again... I dont know why i would care about that but i do so thats the problem...  I know that i need some kind of partner now more then ever, but its life, so that i cant find one...  

I dunno i mean im so screwed up..  I told a girl (jade) who prolly doenst like me anymore that id wait for her... and im getting the vibe from her that she doesnt want me to wait around..  but whenever i ask her about it she gives me a answer along the lines of ""I like you still its just that theres still Richie and whenever i go over to my cousins house and your not there i want to be able to do stuff with Richie and not lose you as a firend"" Casue i told her in the begging of us going out that if she were to cheat on me that id never talk to her again and she knows i was being serouis...  

So after telling this girl all those things ive screwed myself from dateing anyone else... Casue i keep telling jade how much i like her whenever some kind of problem comes up with her mother or one of her friends. Jade is a very emotional girl and every little problem gets blowen out of porportion with her... when someone hates her it affects her in ways it wouldnt effect normal people...  casue the way she feels all she is has is her friends... Her mom and aher are always in fights and when she isnt happy and bousing off the walls like in school shes crying at home!  Im the only one who gets to see that other than that small group of 4 girls that she hangs out with at school....  But anyway i cant date anyone else....  Plus id feel so bad about doing that to her i couldnt give my all into that realtionship so it prolly owuldnt last on my part, id prolly end it very quickly....

I fuckin hate myself sometimes... i put myself in these kind of situations all the damn time... I try ver yhard to help one girl out of a rut in her life and i end up likeing them... Then they tell me it wouldnt work or it isnt working and I end up casueing an even bigger rut in their life and im not there to help them out....  Well ive got to go ill type more tommorw prolly....

My internet is down over my moms house ill post something when i get it back up...

Later guys"

Im just rly nervous... I dont have a clue why though...  Is it casue school is starting on monday? Is it casue i hanet heard from jade in 3 days? Is it casue she probably forgot that she even had me as a boyfriend and she is out with other guys? Am i being paranoued? I dont think so, casue she has cheated on her boyfriends before..  But her longest realtionship was a month... with Jeff.. i intend to change that to ATLEAST a year if i have my way...   Which i prolly wont casue everything else i wanted to have happen didnt so why should this be any different?

Well due to past realtionships wut am i to go on with this? Am i a bad person for feeling this way? For not (i wouldnt say trusting but i cant think of a better word) trusting her? I mean i do trust her but, she hasnt talked to me in 3 days.... when we were friends shed call me everyday no matter wut she was doing or who she was with... Now that were going out i thought itd be the same but i guess i was wrong....  which sucks casue thats false advirtisement and i want my money back :) 

But i dont know.. even though i got my feelings out on this live journal and this is prolly gonna stain me for the rest of the time i have this journal, im still as nervous as i was when i started writing this entry...  Only my heart is beating faster...  I get these panic attacks from time to time and i know its casue of stress but i dont know wut is casuing these stressfull situtions so i cant rly prevent it..

My hands are shaking so much that i can barely type now...
Why is my life so stressfull around holidays?? remeber thanksgiving?  Terrible holiday for me and Christmas was alot better this year then it was last year casue Kelsey came with me to my grandparents house and the whole she was talking my ear off with how nervous she was... This year i got to go over to jades house and see her parents for the first time..  But today im worried that my current girlfriend is cheating on me and i havent heard from my best friend in like a week, i wonder how hes doing, All these rly hott girls keep coming over to me and talking to me when im in Target...  Me being the nice guy i am tell them that i have a girlfriend they give me the line of ""So she doesnt have to know about us"" and i say to her everytime ""No, but i do, and thats something i cant deal with"" then they always get the picture and leave me alone...  If only i was a hustler....

Then i could have any girl i wanted, and that other RLY hott one on the side...  Thatd be cool...

But im not...  So Jade is my one and only women :) i dunno if i think i love her yet...  I know im falling for her, i started falling for her before we started going out..  But im not so sure im there yet.. i know these feelings on insuricurty are a normal boyfriend thing but i rly have huge feelings for her... i just dont think they qualify as love yet...  Regardless when she says it to me i say it back, just to make her happy but, i dont know if i mean it yet...

I think my entry is long enough for now i might come back on little later to update it YET AGAIN...
Later"

"event","Alrighty before this break started, Jade and I started going out and i kissed her the second day we were going out so yes Corey, When u know someone before you date for a while then u can go farther and faster then u would with someone you didnt know before.. Then on i think it was Thursday, that Matt and Lisa started going out..  GOD DAMNIT!!  GOOD WEEK!!!!  WOOO! Im so happy for him and her he seems rly happy so far...  So maybe my perception on her was different then wut it should have been...  but w/e i usally wrong anyway...   THEN I find out Corey is going out with KiKi GET EM COREY GOD DAMN!!!  EVEN BETTER WEEK!!! WOOOOO!!!   Didnt get much for christmas...  MP3 CD PLAYER WOOOOO!!!!!  Lots of money,... few watchs some shtuff..  you know...  shtuff..  Then Matt leaves to go to his moms house all week up until New Years i think... and so im here alone...  Ryan is over at his dads house so i cant play or talk with him or anything like that..  Matts gone...  So i get closer with Molly and her little brother Caleb, He cool and i alrdy knew molly was..  But all week people kept forgetting about me... OR just didnt care, and i didnt do anything about it.... Jade had left for her cousins house and she lives in Baltimore..  So jade gets there on sunday and doesnt call...  Its cool i just saw her yesterday..  Then monday comes along and i get a phone call at like 8 and she talks to me for maybe 10 min. and then is like let me call you back later...  Im still waiting for that phone call....  I havent heard from my girlfriend in 3 days....  and 2 of those days i could have had her come over...  Damnit....  Matt called me up until Tuesday i think it was the last time he called me.... Shtuff....  I MISS JADE SO MUCH BUT I  CANT GET AHOLD OF HER!!!Damnit...wut should i do....  I wonder how shes doing.... I wonder if she rembers im still here or if im her boyfriend for that matter.... ""What happened to us?, We used to be so Perefect,Now were lost and loney, Wut happened to us?, And deep inside i wonder, did i lose my only one?""



I was happy nad hyper up until i posted all those things about jade....  I didnt know i felt that way until i read it over... 

I havent been on livejournal in a while and i havent been on aim in a while either.. Thats becasue for all you people who know who Stephen is he destroyed my comptuers internet connectin with spyware and i have to wait for a professional to come in and fix wut stephen fucked up.....
Stehpen is my little brother...

Man, I rly hope jade isnt doing anything with Richie... I mean i doubt shed keep me around if she felt like she was going to cheat on me.. which is good, but, i dont want to end this alrdy, She makes me feel.... lucky.... like before i couldnt caught a break, but, when i get to see her face there isnt anything i cant do.. ya know... I dunno maybe im being parnoued. I hope so...

Holy god...

First off, Molly and her boyfriend broke up today, Then her little brother and his girlfriend are fighting or brekaing up as well, Then Matt went over to his moms house today and his step-dad might be doing some shit that isnt fuckin soppsed to be doing and i hope Matt handels him casue he fuckin knows if i were there the shit would be done by now...  ME AND JADE GO OUT AS OF MATTS BIRTHDAY!!!!!  WOOOOOT!!!   Plus i met molly's little brother and he is a VERY deep thinker as well...  check out his first poem
""The Death Of"" 
A sigh is on the face of a mind in the sky
All day, dreaming of a life that might go by
Not knowing the truth, that there is no sky
Not knowing the truth, or when he may die 

We do not know what day it will end
For when that day comes, you cannot defend
The end of a life, the end of a lie
The end of a lie, the day you will die 

Die from a world that we werent even born
And after we die, no one will mourn
There will be no one left to fly in the sky
There will be no one left to cry, cry 

Death is not the end, or maybe it was
I wouldnt be here if it did what it does
Spend your time wisely, here on earth
For when you go, you'll never see birth 

Maybe you will, maybe you wont
Because what you believe, is not what you dont
Clueless, we are, of fate's aweful plot
Clueless I was, before I was shot 

Check out this random one that i lied alot:
i lay here,cold, falling asleep
tears freesing to my face, from my life-long weep
forever, and eternity, im crying
for an eternity, im dying

that is my dream, i wish i was dead
i wish i was dead, shot in my head
what you dont know : my wish is granted
my picture of life, in my head, is slanted

i was not sure who it was
he didnt say why, is was ""just because""
maybe he wanted someone to see
he showed me where he wants to be
Well ill check back in with you guys later, ill let his words sink in there..."

But Molly convinced me otherwise :)  Then at lunch Jade was like ""I rly rly like you but if igo out iwth you then alot of people will hate me, and i dont want that so can this wait plz?"" Im like ""Of course jade, the way i feel about you, Id prolly wait forever""  So now it is a waiting game with her......  I SHALL WIN!!!!    God i want to date her so bad and usally when i want something this bad i never get it but things are looking up and she might even come over today if my mom can go pick her up and if she gets home earlyer enough from doing all her arrins...  And also if jade wants to come over at all...  you know?  She might just be like ""I want to come over*but in her head* theres no way in hell id want to go over to his house!* But i might have dance practice tonight so ill have to check Matt!"" But so far Things are looking up so i dunno...

"event","No matter wut i do i always am steping on someone elses toes......  Plus Marie who i really like keeps telling she likes me and thats great but i dont think that she means it so i dont want to try anything with her plus she lives over by my dad so it doesnt really matter but i really like her!  Then with kelsey its like everyday she wants to be all over me and like 4 months ago i would have wanted that but not now i need some space! But if i tell her that then ill hurt her...  OH jesus i just told her...  aquward silence...  omfg now its like i dont care about her...  and how i always have to go, w/e.... I cant believe this its complete bullshit....   LET ME BREATH SOME!!  Now shes telling me that she doesnt care that i hang out with matt too much and that every problem she brings up starts out with ""you act different around Matt"" THE FUCKIN HELL I DO!! I act the same all the time no matter whos in front of me ANYWHERE! But w/e i guess im wrong  maybe my whole perception on the world is wrong maybe im a lier all the way through and through maybe i should fuckin slit my wrists and bleed to death it sounds good....  So after all that yelling at her and ripping her hear t out and throwing it on the gorund and then stomping on it and spitting on it then elbowing it till i cant see from blood in my eyes i realzied.....   That wasnt wut was bothering me.....  Woops......   LoL    Okay Jade has a best friend named Brittany  I think i might have a crush on her, but Jade doesnt want me to like her becasue she thinks well lose contact...  and ill end up not like jade anymore...  and Jade apperatly doesnt want that, i dunno why becasue im really tierd of hearing about how many guys like her and how much she likes AMC but now likes Richie....  Amazing how fast girls get over you...  She had a crush on Matt then me Then for al ong time AMC now Richie...  It kinda hurt me that she doesnt like me anymore but i can be so close to her and not be able to have her but i guess i signed up for it when i said sure ill be your best friend....  SO now that i might like brittany jade is getting farther away from me and i can feel her leaving me slowly maybe becasue she is going out with richie now or maybe becasue of the brittany thing...  i dunno maybe i should let her go... Now more for Marie...  Marie i REALLY like! But she lives so far away and when i talk to her on the phone i dont fell uncomfortable and shutff but the only time i feel uncomfortable is when im like yea i have a crush on you and she says it back becasue i dont know if shes saying it to please me or if she really means it and im really TOO scared to ask her....        I just dont want that to end im hanging on that like a monkey hangs from trees.....     Shes so beatiful and i dont think if she gets rid of her boyfriend and we start gettings rides to see each other that itll work out casue no matter how hard i try something falls through and it hurts when you want to see someone that badly and there like yea maybe next time....

Well maybe next time ill heal faster......"

Which is extremly confusing casue she keeps saying she likes AMC, but, she tells me that she has a crush on me as well... And cant stop thinking about me...  I have a HUGE crush on jade but....  Marie wants me to go out with her and i cant becasue i have no way of seeing her so ill have to wait to get a car to see her.... and jade hasnt said that she wants to go out with me but i think she does casue she gave off hints like ""I cant stop thinking about you"" and stuff like that so i dunno....   Then there still kelsey who is currently going out with me and things with her are fuckin awsome....  Marie is out of the equation... for now....  then theres jade, and i dont think she wants to go out with me anyway..    so shes out that leaves kelsey and i love her to death so im gonna just tell jadel that i dont think i should persue this kind of ordeal with her casue i dont cheat on women and ask her if she can respect that and if she cant then i guess ill have to leave her alone... I dont want to casue she is my best female friend but if she has this thing for me and i have someone i cant talk with her... one  becasue i like her  and two becasue i DONT cheat on women.. NEVER have NEVER will....  Im gonna tell her tonight, Matt if you read this remind me to tell you casue im not posting it in my live journal....

We started a break on thursday so i could make a move on lauren but i lost all nerve wut-so-ever so it didnt happen...   Matts pissed at someone and i cant do jack shit to help him...  Only someone else can and that doesnt help me any...   On saturday we went to the Baltimore Blast game....    It was very fun casue when the annocer annoced that Edgewood High School was in the staiduam and they all stood up and started cheering, so did me and matt..  Only we werent in the edgewood section...  We were in the middle creek section...   So we got looks like ""Wut the fuck are you doing over here!?"" and ""Go to Hell Buddy"" Im sitting here like Jesus matt maybe we should leave...
so we left the middle river section and went over to edgewood...   Needless to say we got rejected out of the edgewood section casue we didnt play soccer...   So we came back down and stayed silent until the last 15 min. of the game when me and matt started to cheer our asses off!!!  Hell they came back and scored like 3 goals in 2 minuets when we started cheering so im thinkin if only we cheered in the first half of the game this wouldnt be nessary....  Then after the game i wanted to go down to talk to one of the cheerleaders but his grandma wouldnt let me go HOLLER!!!  FUCKIN HELL!!! *Drowls* Damn she was hott...
But anyway i dont know wut to do...  Life is such a bitch maybe i should just keep to a small little group of people nad make them rly close with me...  Insted of having the world wide fame that everyone craves but few ever recevie...  not trying to sound arragent but i prefer to be alone with a few select friends rather then have loads that i barly know..   Me nad Matt took a test on quizilla..  It was ""What is your element?""    Matt got Light  basically calling him an angel and that he puts other above himself and that hes a hero. Well me and matt are best friend bascially alike down to the bone....   I got Darkness....
Funny how that works out...   They said that i wasnt a hero till someone needed it...  Like id be Saito from Ruroni Kenshin  a bad guy till someone needs me bad enough then im a hero but only for a short peroid of time....   and i look at all problems and my attidue have a sense of ""Leave me the fuck alone, Shut the fuck up""
Ya know...   it things like this that make me feel this big I---I"

"event","Alright, i try to tell it like it is and im called arrigent or however you spell it...  Wutever it doesnt even matter...   Im actully going to homecoming...  Who would have thought.. me.. going to homecoming...  I cant freak dance but im a good slow dancer :)  But im gonna feel bad acasue kelsey said she isnt going to dance with anyone cept for me but deep down i know she wants to go out there and freak dance with other guys..   I mean im happy she wants to make me happy and everything...   but i feel so bad at the same time that im supressing her...  but i know if i tell her once to go have fun with those other guys shes gonna freak dance the whole time with every guy there and ill just end up getting pissed off.....  So i feel bad but i still dont want her to dance with other guys....   Maybe i shouldnt go to homecoming...   Maybe i should have stayed broken up with her until after homecoming.....  MAYBE!! But i didnt so i have to deal with feeling bad all on my own..  Christ...   Anyway, Jade still flirts with me like hell, Lauren still flirts with me but i havent talked to her in a while, Arien wants to go out with me and got rid of her boyfriend to wait for me...  and there is a new girl Page, she isnt all that hott but i like to flirt with her casue shes funny....   makes me laugh :)   ANYWAY  im not trying to be arrigent im just giving an update....  Today was pep rally and i was sitting there in all black for about  an hour and 30 min. Got kinda hot...   But we beat the shit out of every other class in screaming...   07!!!!   Senoirs couldnt touch us, Jouniors even lower, and freshman didnt even speak....   MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAH     But i didnt get to see my girlfriend after the pep rally let out :(   Oh shit thats right..  Tasha wants me to kiss her to see if she still likes me..  But i cant cheat on kelsey that isnt like me....   I have to let Tasha off soft BUT HOW TO DO IT!   Im the kinda guy who would do it in person and crush her feelings..  So how to do it softly i just dont know....

How am i soppsed to respond to jeaoulsy?  

Can i trust kelsey when her bestfriend called me up and told me that kelsey and josh were dateing for 2 months behind my back?

She broke out into tears when i told i found all this stuff out which leads me to belive either kelsey is infact hated or shes the one lieing to me and im being deseved..   Well the one way she gets one over on me i get pussy and the other way i still get pussy

"event","Well, For starters lets start with recent events...    Corey has decided to take me and Matt S. and Matt B. Under his wing to teach us some basic martail arts and sword fighting techniques....   Only problem is i rly dont see how martial arts are going to help me when my oppent has a sword and is cutting my fuckin arm off while im trying to pull his nose of with my 2 nuckels..  But i like it so ill keep it up..  Also, My ex or recent girlfriend and me have gotten back together and have had yet another fight....   She got pissed at me for being pissed at her for ditching me for her friends when i cant see or talk with her outside of school. Thern a whole bunch of things happened. We talked them out and now i think were to the point where were fine for the weekend and then well need to talk some more on monday but on monday everything is going to be cleared up and were going to be ok...    Or so im hopeing thanks to corey very much appreated words of wisdom...   he otld me to ""Talk with her, hear wut she has to say and then make a descion from there"" so thats wut i did and were fine...   But my bestfriend Matt told me that hes been in this kind of relationship and he knows wuts going to happen and he knows how she is going to break up with me...  No offence matt but she is VERY different from Emma or Jessica so i dont think you would know wut your talking about...   She shows she cares when there is no one around only I see the tears you dont have a clue as to how much a simple name like ""skank"" hurt her... Only i do and im still sry for it....   There is no more of that fighting shit, josh has left me alone and i intend to keep it that way   No more drama for me! YAY! School is getting hard to keep up with when you dont do any of the homeworks....   And im devopling a huge ass problem..  So many women and i have kelsey...   Alright theres one girl that i like Airen..  but there another one after her and her name is Jade  and then after her is Lauren..  But while im devopling these crushs i still have Kelsey and i dont intend to do anything bout these crushs and its not like i could anyway even if i wanted to because these girls do not live near me...   Is it becasue i grew my hair out? Is that it, i mean cmon LAST YEAR YOU COULDNT LIKE ME BUT NOW!!!   CMON!!!!!!!!!!!!

Christ....   LoL All those women by the way like me and 2 of em are in the same class   EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Well im stop the spamming i alryd have a HUGE ASS journal entry so ill come back either later on when there arent so many ppl around me or tommorw moring =) LATER GUYS!"

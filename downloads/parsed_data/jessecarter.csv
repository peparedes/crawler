"event","Ahhahahah. I remember this game. Not so much a game, but also very much one. If you don't understand that you don't need to. I thought I had it all, but this one person kept popping back up in my life and causing all kinds of chaos for me at the time. Now, even back then I didn't think it was a fair judgement, and I argued this point for a long time, but eventually it became easier to just nod and agree. Although you'd be proud, it remained a very sore subject up until the day it all ended. Which, I'm not sure when that was. There was the night I got the email from some guys wife, that kind of set the end in motion. We'd been struggling for a while, but that was like a splash of cold shitty water to the face. So maybe that was the day. Anyways. Now it seems that this other person and I have switched places, and roles. I try to make simple, friendly contact, and I get very mixed messages. I'd like to think I can interpret those subtleties being as I used to act the EXACT same way towards her, this person I knew. Her behavior is new for her towards me, but very familiar regardless. I just want a chance, a chance to know if what we saw was real and not just fantasy. Time changes people though. Maybe we don't even know each other. Maybe we never will.

OH WELL!

The trick is, try and care as little as possible. It's all just a joke in the end. Most people never even make it to the punchline, but I'm going to be there with glass raised. I wonder who will stand beside me, or if I shall stand alone, laughing into the imminent oblivion.

I don't think I'll be alone."

"event","Hard to believe another year has gone by. 2010 was a weird year. A sad year.  A good year. Heartbreak, friendship, sex, drugs, rock and roll. Started off pretty good, took some serious unplanned dips into depression and hating my life, but in the months coming up to the new year, things have started to trend back upwards. Living here in a fantastic house in a new state with some of my oldest friends and some new ones, skiing all the time, making coffee for a living. In the same place I was working when I lived in LA, when I was with her, when she was with me. It still hurts sometimes, but its more of a once every month or two hurt, not an every second of every day pain like it was for so long. I don't think I'll ever get over her, stop loving her, missing her. I do think it'll keep getting better though. I didn't see how it could go from the black pit it was to the place I'm in now, but it happened. 2011 is going to be the year I break through the rest of this shit and move on with my life, whether I want to or not. It's happening, it needs to, and the groundwork has been laid. 

I'm moving forward, outside into the sun, out of this fog. I hope I see you there, though I haven't met you yet, you must exist. She can't have been it, whatever the evidence, when the chips were down all I got was betrayed, and thats not love. Love is still out there for me. I'm not bothering to look hard for it, it'll come when it comes. Until then I'm going to try and put a smile on my face and keep it there, I'm going to have fun, and I'm going to enjoy being alive.

Happy 2011 nonexistent readers of this!

There is a life out there for me, a future, and its mine to take if I want. I do, I want to do something permanent.

"event","Now what. Reading through all my old entries on here I feel sorry for the guy back in '06 and '07 and '08. If only he knew how little forward motion he would make by mid '10. Heartbreak? Check. Bouncing from unfulfilling job to unfulfilling job? Check. Loss of motivation, purpose, drive, and an overwhelming sense of apathy? Check. Bitter, whiny, emo bullshit written online when feeling sorry about oneself? Check.

I don't know where to go from here. 

I miss having somebody. Somebody to hold close and inhale their scent and be entirely content and comfortable just being close. Fucking hell, I don't miss having somebody, I miss having specific people. Which is a bunch of shit, because all those people did was abandon or betray me. Still, in my dreams, where the skeletons in my closet don't exist, we are back like it used to be. It's not a blind fantasy, music playing and clouds opening up while golden heavenly light rains down upon us. Its simple. Its just us. A kiss, a head on a shoulder, a hand ran slowly through a head of hair. 

Then I wake up. Its a very confusing way to start your day, part of me wakes and immediately wishes violently that she was next to me. The other part, reality, creeps in slowly, reminding me that she isn't here, and she won't ever be here again. I wouldn't be able to forgive, or to trust her again. Would I? It's a stupid question to ask, I'll never get the chance to answer it, and thats probably a good thing. Still, here we are, I've lost track of time since you left, but it's been almost a year now since there was an us hasn't it? I still don't care for the company of others, not in that way, not for long. We always said it would be hard if not impossible to get over each other, that the thought of having to go back out in this shitty world by ourselves and find somebody better? Incomprehensible. I'd think after almost a year, my mind would be able to wrap itself around this concept, but I cannot. She broke me, she betrayed me, but I was a better person with her then without, I loved her and still do, if I had a magic fucking wand, I'd use it. I am terrified of running into her. Its past the time when she said she might be back in this part of the world, my part. I don't know what I would say, that is if I survived the inevitable massive coronary that resulted from my immediate panic attack. I don't trust myself. I miss her too much.

Sometimes, rarely, but sometimes, I'll log on to skype, just for a minute. Every time my heart stops and my breath catches in its throat as the 'Friends Online' window opens, but your name has always been greyed out. Offline. I don't know what I'd do if I ever saw you online. Probably stare, frozen, at your name until you messaged me, I passed out, or I'd quit out. My therapist wanted me to write down all the things I want to say to you, I want you to know. Thats what this is for. I don't think you even remember this exists anymore, but thats not the point. I have to say these things. I can't keep living with this shit poisoning my insides. I don't know if writing it out will help, but I'm damn sure willing to try. 

You went from saving my life to being my fucking cancer."

You can see there is nothing behind them but more flat empty nothingness. He sits. Uncomfortable but nothing to do about that but call the army of tiny white soldiers with their tiny little identification numbers and letters printed on their blue and white and yellow fronts. Fight! Fight for he who commands you, he who is prescribed you, or occasionally he who has purchased you. Mercenaries! They are warriors all. Sometimes he goes out. The bars are noisy and full of stupid people, and he orders whiskeys and smokes cigarettes and watches as the world fucks and snorts and drinks and smokes its way into oblivion with a big fat Cheshire smile. He thinks about how he is better then all these, these people. Yet he knows the truth, its clear and bright and he knows it but he says to himself that its just bullshit.

As he thinks these things, he imagines himself on a rooftop, standing on the ledge, arms thrown dramatically outward, dressed to the nines, screaming it like some psychotic nihilist mantra. He grins at his own vainglorious idiocy, and only at this point does he notice the people standing in front of him, staring at him, those looks, so curious. Like the sound you hear when you are standing in the ocean, and a wave crashes! Crashes! Crashes over your head and submerges you. That instant silence followed by the dull roar that quickly grows into a loud, noisy, and very jolting reality. This is also a visual from inside his head, playing out even as it happens for real, here, now. He realizes that they've been talking, probably to him at some point, but he can't seem to find the motivation to care. Or even to find motivation. At some point soon, he will go home. Maybe to sleep, maybe to fuck, maybe to sit again. He thinks of a line he heard on tv once, something memorable, but ask him and he wouldn't be able to remember.

"event","Hello LiveJournal. I return to you after two years, and not to post something for the masses. Not to entertain or titillate the public, I'm back with a personal message. 

There's every good chance in the world that you will never read this, which is largely in part why I am writing it. That's entirely the reason I post this here, rather then emailing you, facebooking you, myspacing you, skyping you, the list of ways we can connect through the world wide web is endless, but you don't deserve my personalization. I've sat there with my finger hovering over the ""Send Message"" button on Facebook and Myspace more times then you'll know, but its too easy, and fuck, you know I don't ever take the simple way out. I miss you. Somedays I make it all the way through without that pang, that stab of unexpected raw emotion that hits out of nowhere. Somedays I can't go anywhere without hearing a song, seeing a fucking restaurant, a movie poster, the goddamn sunshine will send me straight back to you. In those times I can smell you, feel you, almost taste you, and its fucking awful because I know its over and theres nothing I can do about that. I tell myself that it all worked out for the best, that what happened was horrible but just what I needed for closure on the whole thing. Yeah thats a nice neat explanation, one I can tell my friends and family, one that is believable, that convinces them I'm alright and gets them off my back. Only you and I know the depths that this has taken me to though. The same depths I'd think you'd be experiencing, but thats a thought formed on my thinking I knew you inside and out, while apparently you were perfectly able to keep things from me, to lie to my face, so I don't know how much credence that really lends. You've truly burned me, broken my heart into a thousand pieces, and scattered them to the corners of the earth. I am but a sad little pile of ashes and the most base of survival instincts. You shattered my world, and you need to know that. I couldn't comprehend doing the things to someone I love that you did to me. Its not something that my mind can wrap around, and thats saying something being as everybody I know thinks I'm the biggest asshole/dickhead/jerkoff they know. You are a destroyer of worlds, but that doesn't mean I didn't love you. Thats the catch, thats the worst part. I loved you more then I thought I could ever love something. I literally did not understand the very concept of love until you. You made me fall head over heels for you, and you loved me back more then anything I could have ever hoped for. You made me feel like I was the only man in the world for you, but that was just false glass promises waiting to be shattered. I LOVED YOU. Goddammit you know me, you've seen me at my best and my worst, you KNOW me, and you know what that means to me. The other night, I slept fitfully at best, 30-50 minutes at a time. I dreamt of you all night. The bitch of it all is that in my dreams I can forgive you. In my dreams I've reached a point where everything thats happened before doesn't seem to matter. We are together again, and thats all that's important. There is no past, there is no future, there is just now, me and you. I wake from these dreams in a cold sweat, and upon fully entering reality from the shadowy murk of my subconcious, I feel like vomiting, because I know that I will never really feel like that again. I actually called out of work that day, siting a slight emotional breakdown as my reasoning. That was the worst its been in a while, but its been bad since. Dreams are as close as I will ever get to what I once had with you. The girl I thought I'd spend the rest of my life with. My lover, my friend, my teammate. Gone. Forever gone. I thought we'd be together forever. Reality turned out even harsher then we ever thought it could be huh? And we went through some SHIT, but I always figured we'd pull through whatever life threw at us. Never thought it would be this bad. I hate what you've done, but I still miss you. I still love you. I'm sorry its over. So fucking sorry. Not to you, just...sorry. Miserably so. 

You probably won't ever see this. Thats both a comfort and a source of great despair. I never got to say goodbye. I deserved that. I earned that. I never got to say goodbye."

"event","You look so good standing next to me. The last time I saw you was in a train station. It was cold, or at least thats how I felt. You looked so small then, so helpless and sad. I wanted to pick you up and hug you until you became a part of me. You looked so good through your tears, so beautiful and tragic. I hate to see you cry, but I love to marvel at how your beauty twists and changes with each new emotion, shaping itself to your feelings, but never diminishing, only growing brighter evermore. You looked so good, I couldn't look back. I needed to look, but I knew I couldn't. If I'd seen your teary little form turn and walk back towards the car, I knew I would have abandoned everything and ran to you, left with you, stayed with you. Its all I wanted to do, and everything I knew I had to resist.

You look so amazing standing next to me. That white dress you wear so well, its beauty is nothing compared to you. I've never been more happy then I am now, I've never known a love so deep and so pure. I can't wait to spend the rest of my days with you, I can't wait for the rest of our life. You cry when I say my vows, but thats okay. I'll probably cry when you say yours, but you won't tell anyone.

You look so beautiful laying on the bed, me kneeling beside you. Holding our child in your arms, exhaustion mixed with a transcendent joy upon your face. Never before have you looked as beautiful as you do now, giving life to our love, creating something new and miraculous between us. I have never been more proud of you, of us. The way you hold our child in your arms, cradling it ever so gently, I know our lives will never be the same.

You've never looked sexier sitting on our porch with me, holding hands, talking about nothing, talking about everything. You still make me laugh, and you still think I'm funny. We've made it a long time, its been quite a ride. Our lives aren't over though, we still have plenty of time, and as long as we're together, thats all that matters.

You look so good standing next to me. I don't want to get on that train. I don't want to leave you here. I have to though, because I want to have everything with you, I want to have a life with you. I want it all, and scenarios of what our life might be like flash through my head as I'm walking towards the train, and away from everything I love and need. I can do it though, I can do it for us. We can do it for us. I want everything with you. I'll do anything to get it. I love you more then anything in the entire world baby. You are my light, my rock, my starfish, my universe in a 5 foot two smokin' little package. I can't wait to see you again!

Happy Valentines my love!"

I agree wholeheartedly. You can lie between her legs for all the time you think you have, but it won't scratch the surface of what you truly have to go through. I write this sitting apon a bathroom floor, my bathroom floor to be exact. I write this after quite a few beers, and quite a few bowls. I write this while listening to Damien Rice and smoking a cigarette. I don't know what else to do. I am at a loss for words, and this is not a symptom which affects me on a regualr basis. If I'm not good for words then what am I good for? What potential do I have in this life if I can't write something that people want to read, if I can't satisfly that demand for catching lymerics and anecdotes. All I can do at this point is just hope. Hope that what I was told my whole life doesn't turn out to be nothing but folly and circumstance. Ever since I was but a tiny boy, I was told that my language arts and reading/writing skills were off the charts. Give me a simple algebra problem and I'll bust my head open trying to solve it. Give me something rooted in science and I'll scratch my head and give you a confused look at best. Give me something to edit, give me something to write and I'll blow you out of the water. I've never been one to extol my own efforts and talents without giving sufficiant evidence, but search through the past writings I've published. Tell me when God. Tell me when I've reached that point where I've reached somebody other then myself. I write here now as I used to write. Slumming, sitting somewhere no one has sat before, crushed by the misshaped promises as were made to me. Promises that were failed. ""Love taught me lie, life taught me to die."" I can't help but quote those that came before me, those that seem to have experienced what I have. I have a limited audience I know, if and audience at all I have. All I mean to say is that I have reached a point commonly reffered to as the ""end of my rope"". Do you believe in me? Do you wish me to continue my writing? All I want is one person not romantically or family obligated to tell me that I should continue, that I should persevere. Daylight. I only want to live to see the daylight swarm in through open blinds, hitting my eyes and waking me from a lifelong slumber. I only want to be what I can be, and nothing more. I am but a lost soul, adrift upon a dark and hopeless sea. Daylight. Daylight. Save me."

Its just one of those nights, with the long silent retrospectives, the flashes of things gone by. Its Oscar night in my mind, the statue for ""Most Spectacular Implosion"" gripped firmly in my fist. Who to thank, who to thank. Who's really responsible for who I am today? Is it my parents, with their split regime of overbearing religion and a seemingly unhappy and faithless existence? Is it my friends, and if so, which group? The ones that I attened youth group with, the ones I would stay up all night playing video games with? Or the other group, the ones that taught me to love the taste of cheap beer and cigarettes, the ones who introduced me to drugs and music and general hazy nights? The women, as few as they are, have always played a powerful part in my life. I don't know what it is about me, what is fucked in my psyche that makes me have such insane relationships. They range from innocent to bizarre to way in over my head. I guess I'd thank them all, a laundry list of people and places and experiences, a confessional that couldn't be censored, that couldn't be ignored. I can't deal with all this, I can't dwell on all this shit. I'm clean and sober now, a nicotine addiction the only remnant of that old me, the rare drunken celebration. The only things that keep me going are xanax, the faint glimmer of hope, and a wonderful woman. Man cannot live on this alone, he can only run on fumes for so long. Lets hope I make it to the next refueling station. Something good needs to happen, and it needs to happen now."

"event","I saw two birds fucking this morning. One was a pigeon, one of those large, dirty looking things you see in urban areas, pecking at cigarette butts and dropped french fries. The other was an LA bird. I call it an LA bird you see, because thats what I've been trained to think when I see them. I first heard the term from a friend of mine here, somebody who grew up in the Los Angeles area, and knows it well. The LA bird is a smallish, dirty brown avian creature that defies all typical species classification. Kind of like a sparrow, but larger, more...well, dirty. These birds flourish around here, because much like pigeons, they are able to live anywhere and off of anything. They function as a sort of mascot for the seedy heart of Los Angeles, a filthy struggling little creature who will always be around, a survivor. Anyways, I was out on the balcony of my second story apartment having a morning smoke. The morning smoke is important. Today it was extra important, as I was woken at 10am by the cable guy pounding on my door. I rose with a mix of excitement and reluctance. Reluctance on behalf of the fact that I reeeeally didn't want to get out of bed just yet, and excitement because its been months since I've had internet, and today was finally the day. So I get up, let them in, point them in the right direction, and pad outside in my slippers and gym shorts for that ever important morning ciggy. I'm sitting in the brown wooden chair. Its my favorite chair on the balcony. You'd think it'd be the white rocking chair that I favor, but no, the thin slats on the back hurt my neck. So I sit in the brown one, the one that looks like those chairs they would've made you use back in some small 1950's schoolhouse. My gaze drifts across the street, and there, on the roof, are the two birds. The little LA shitbird is on bottom, all hunched and low to the ground, and the pigeon is mounting it from behind, just pounding away. Now, I don't know much about the anatomy of birds, I don't know how they reproduce, or if they even fuck in this manner, but regardless of all these things, these birds were going at it. I watched for a good two minutes, till the Camel in my left hand had burned almost to the filter, and then the pigeon hopped off and took a few steps to the side. The LA bird straightened up and shook itself off, and they both began to pick at themselves, cleaning off their wings, scratching at their chests, all the while facing away from one another. Here I had the thought, these birds are not so unlike most of us. We meet, we go somewhere, we fuck each other, and then we turn away, perhaps embarrassed, perhaps ashamed, but neither one willing to look the other in the eye anymore. After another minute of this awkward cleaning/scratching/avoiding, the pigeon flew off, and the little LA bird stayed, staring almost motionless into the sky after it."

Is there a way to say it that makes it sound better, he thinks? There is no way to make that one word any less the mood killer then it is. Cancer. Its a cold word, alien to his ears, and carries a certain sting he feels somewhere left of his breast. She goes on, saying its going to be fine, the doctors think they got it all, they think maybe its a less serious kind. Oh, and they cut out a portion of her leg. At this point the words he's hearing stop making sense, everything slows to a dull hum and all he can picture are the most horrible of things. She's still doing it though, putting that light and unconcerned spin on everything, but its a beautiful silk pillow filled with broken glass. No matter what you cover it with, its still going to cut and hurt and maim, and you will still wake up with less of yourself, bleeding out slowly. The conversation ends with her telling him not to worry, that she'll be fine, she's sure of it. He hangs up the phone, but everything is like a low budget indie film with bad direction, quick cuts, the colors are all wrong, the visuals don't make any sense to him. He goes back to work, what else can he do, but he doesn't hear anybody for the rest of the day. He still smiles when they expect him to, laughs when they want, but inside, he isn't there. He's somewhere else, he's at home, he's seven years old again, sitting on her lap, she's reading to him from his favorite book. She is soft and warm, and full of everything he holds dear. She is all he knows then, she is all he needs. She finishes reading and lays him in bed, pulling the thick comforter up under his chin, softly brushing back his hair. She kisses his forehead and tells him goodnight, that she loves him more then anything. He curls up under the blankets, and looks up at her with sleepy/happy eyes.

Had a birthday party for Ashley, hoo rah for 21st's. Went to a bar last night, got her good and saucy.

Theres too many expenses and never enough money, swiftly realizing that being an ""adult"" sucks ass. Enjoy your youth, growing up costs way too fucking much. 

Drinking a lot, but not really getting drunk a lot. Becoming one of those old men who comes home from work to relax in front of the TV with a couple beers before retiring to read a little before bed. God I'm middle aged already (in my mind).

Have some kickass new roommates. Best collection of people in one home since I moved here almost a year ago. 

Been thinkin a lot about the past lately. In a very retrospective mood, but then again, when am I not. 

Wanting to write, needing to write. Have a completly kickass idea for a short story, but lacking the balls to actually write it. Coasting by on past accomplishments will only get you so far methinks. 

Going to get a fresh beer. Maybe watch some TV. Start the whole thing over again tomorrow."

"event","If God exists, then where is the mystery in life? The mystery of course, lies in whether or not there is a supreme being who lives somewhere in the great beyond, above our conciousness, above anything we can ever or will ever understand. Sometimes I wonder though. Is such a wonder or such a though enough to guarentee me a one way ticket to the lake of fire, the burning mountains of sulfur and eternal damnation? I can't believe in a God that picks and chooses his followers so glibly. I can't believe that this person, while being selfish and ignorant and spiteful will gain entrance to the pearly gates simply because they believe in Christ, while on the other end of the spectrum exist some of the most caring and loving people I've ever met. Those people will suffer till the end of time because they don't believe in Jesus? I can't believe it, I won't believe it. The closest I've come to seeing God is staring up at a bathroom ceiling late at night, waiting for something, anything to happen, to take me away from here, from this life, from this failure. Thats as close as I've come, and its all I've ever seen."

When you wake up, and somewhere along the way, your brain stalls, and doesn't fully enter the real world, and the dreams become hazy, everything mixes, and for a few brief moments, its beautiful. Its chaotic, the closest you could ever come to being completly insane without actually crossing over. I lay there, head spinning, carrying on conversations with the girl who'd woken me and the girl in my dreams, simultaneously. Sometimes they're the same. Sometimes they aren't. Today I woke in squalor, surrounded by filthy huts occupied by filthy people. Long stretching dirt roads lined with the bloated corpses of dogs. Some faces familiar. Most not. There is something, something on the air. Can smell it. Familiar, but can't quite place it. Death. Abandonment. Despair. This place reeks with the absence of hope. One of my eyes see's this world, this horrible place, and one of them see's the girl, the real one. One of my hands is burnt and calloused, and her hair is matted yet comforting to my touch. The other hand is held by her of flesh and blood, she is warm, she is here. I don't know which way to go, can't tell which is real. I shut my eyes again, and hope to wake somewhere else, somewhere that feels."

The sound it makes as it strikes nothing but dried and bare ground at the bottom is enough to startle my soul. I raise my head, and look about. With every new blink there is a new world. Every time my eyelids rise and set like the sun on my own horizon, there is a new beginning, and a new end. I no longer believe, my cup runeth dry. I no longer see with faith, but with the cold and cynical views that being sharpened on the strop of harsh experience can leave you with. I walk on broken glass, and though I often don't feel it, never feel it, I lost my shoes so long ago. I stop, look down, take a moment to dwell on this small but strange turn of events. Where did they go? Down the mouths of Donner Party victems I conclude, torn apart somewhere in the ice and in the snow, the last meal before the first dead were cooked. This makes enough sense to me, so I walk on, leaving the bloody footprints behind me, disappearing in seconds, no one will know I was ever here. 

I stop at the gates. They are massive gates. They loom with a presence indescribable, they invoke words in me that I've never heard before. My head hurts as I apply the vocabulary I once thought was substantial, but come up with nothing but stutters and whispers of languages I never cared to learn. I reach forward and grasp the bars. Cold to the touch, with a hint of warmth at their core. I scream through them, I scream, and the sound turns to something else, something I can't hear, but something I can see. It is dark and it is hurt and it is dying. It rushes forth like Friday nights after too much happy hour, I can't stop it, and when its done, when its left me, I collapse as a man drained. The cloud hangs for a moment, an evil swirling within it, before it disippates and is lost in the shadow of those gates. Those damn gates. They won't open for me, and soon I'll have to blink again, and I'll be somewhere else, I'll be somebody else. 

Oh Lord, where is my faith? Where is the harvest you promised your servants? Are we who think for ourselves not good enough? Are we who's ideas may somtimes differ from that which you taught doomed? Is there no hope for us? For if the only options are conformity to something I can't agree with whole heartedly, and death, then I choose death."

Periods of nostalgia can take so many forms. Sometimes they're the date rape drug dropped in unsuspecting drinks, leading to blurry nights where the only things you can remember are the only things you'd rather never dwell on again. Sometimes its that kiss of sunlight on a day starved face, so many countless nights passing by but never does there seem to be a sunrise. It can come on a note of music or a word scrawled aimlessly across an old forgotten notebook page. People, places, memories, springing to mind unbidden, the scars of the past can't be hidden forever by the priests, plastic surgeons for the soul. Grace is easy to forget, but turning a blind eye to all the hate and self loathing will only lead you in a circle, spiraling downward. Theres no prescription for failure, no little white cure-all to be taken twice a day, no bottle deep enough to drown the truth. Life is failure, and the sooner you realize it the sooner you can beat it and succeed. Success is death though of course, so make your choice and choose wisely. People die for their convictions everyday, perishing as your on your way by the Starbucks closest to the office, double soy lattes can't fix your fucking inadequacy. They slap labels on everything, trying to file everyone into a drawer and slap a prescription on them all, keep them sedated and in control. They tell me I'm depressed. They tell me I'm sick. They tell me things based on the things I tell them though, so in the end, who is fooling who? Theres always that small voice though, and nothing I've done can every make it go away. I'm sick of running from it, perhaps its time to turn and face it. I'm running at full tilt love, my sword pulled from its hilt. Goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, its time."

Had I been drinking, you ask? Nope, not a drop. Why, oh why, was I trying to drink from the opposite side of a bottle? Because the old wives tale would lead one to believe that doing so will rid you of the hiccups. Here's the kicker. I, Jesse, have had the hiccups for 36 hours now. 36 HOURS STRAIGHT. They've gone away a couple times for 20 or 30 minutes, but then they inevitably return. I've tried everything. Every medical recommendation, nothing. Every friendly suggestion from coworker and associate, nothing. So I finally turned to the myths, the old wives tales, the spoon fulls of sugar, the opposite sides of the glass (or bottle).

I'm only taking it right now, while I need it, and soon, when I don't need it, I won't take it. Right? I have to tell myself these things. I scream at the sky in my thoughts, asking why I am forced to go through this. Why doesn't my mind work like everybody elses? Why am I tormented by these things? Why can't I brush aside the everyday stress and worry, why does it stick to me and needle me and infect me? I can sit for hours and try to write it out, as if the more and more I type, the more all the suffering and the hardships will flow from that heavy spot in my chest down my arms through my hands and out my fingertips, tapping away at the keyboard, locking it all away in words.

Sunsets beautifully accentuated by the failings of man, five o'clock skylines backlit with smog. Old, my brain tells me. Tired, played out, move on. Heartbreak? Check. Loss? Check. Success followed by an unfamiliar fear of success? Metaphors layered upon metaphors upon metaphors, until its hard for even me to tell what I was originally trying to say? Bingo. Yes, I've done it before, these pages are filled with perfect examples of such writing. There is a voice in every writer however, a style, a distinct flavor, a usage of words or similies or adjectives or any number of writing tricks that makes them who they are. Something that shout yes, I wrote this, and have no doubts, for although my name may not rest at the top nor the bottom of the page, my signature curls and flows through the piece, from opening to close, so that you who read it will know what it is. Maybe thats my thing. Maybe I'm a metaphor guy. If so, then please do your best to interpret the following. 

There have been flashes lately, more and more as far as I can tell. The dated entries in my notebook have been growing closer and closer to one another, until the once sparse pages are becoming dark with scribbled writing. A reflection on some inner thoughts perhaps, some unreachable portion of my subconcious flowing out through pen and ink, bleeding himself out onto paper night after night. All I see sometimes are empty prescription bottles, rattling up against one another in the medicine cabinet, reminding me of days lost to forgotten problems. Everything is so desperate in those moments, drowing in a sea of insecurities, clutching against the walls, never being able to pull myself up. Thats when the medication kicks in, and from there on out all I remember is the floating sensation, the euphoria brought on by chemicals and the liquor its chased with. He sighs as he reads back over the last sentence. Drinking away bitterness in a sea of little white FDA approved miracles is overdone, nobody will care. The awkard and jarring switches between first and third person will leave his editor red faced and furious, nobody will read such garbage. Its my life though, its my experience, and however comes to fruition, the fact still remains that such a story must be told. These thoughts must be purged, these lies must be laid bare, and redemption must be sought. I haven't seen her in weeks now, my calls go unanswered, my letters returned. Anybody else would wonder at the sanity and practicality of a modern day man who still writes his correspondence out from time to time, what with the general public oversaturated with email, text messaging, cell phones and laptops. She knows though, she is one of the few who understands him, who didn't write him off as eccentric that night 14 months ago, the gathering, the meeting. That part of the story lies further ahead yet, and the beginning hasn't even been told. So turn with me if I haven't lost you yet, and let me tell you my story."

I was hung up on by one old friend, but I'm over that, and beginning to wonder if I should just get over them. Regardless. It was nice. Hell, it was great. It was one of the most uneventful and yet purely enjoyable New Years Eves I've ever had. 

I kissed her sweetly as the clock struck midnight. She kissed me back hard and fierce, and I came away breathless and smiling. 

Thanks to all who were good enough to wish me a happy new years last night. I miss all my old friends and family in the CO, and its good to know that some of you miss me too.

Hope everyone's year began as well as mine, and I hope the hangovers weren't too bad this morning."

Sadly to say, my motivation and drive has not been sufficient enough to actually get off the couch, find a pen and a pad, and put thought to paper. My laptop suffered a stroke. The screen turned a vibrant but overwhelmingly obnoxious shade of pink. I took it into the Apple Store in Brea, and to my suprise, they offered me a brand new 13.3 inch MacBook with 1g Ram, an 80g harddrive, plenty of extras and goodies, and a superdrive. It should be coming into the store all ready for me any day now. 
       In other news, my girlfriend is in Hawaii. I am here, in fuckall California. I would like to able to say that I am alone, however in a move that both shocked and blindsided, my parents decided to come down and suprise me for Christmas. Oh deck the halls with parents who rarely take a break from arguing or drinking, respectively. They mean well I'm sure though, and hell, they brought gifts. Back to Ashley being in Hawaii. Fuck that. Fuck her being all the way in Hawaii and leaving me with the 'rents for xmas. I mean yeah, I encouraged her to go, as I still would if I had to do it over again. Doesn't mean I don't miss that little sex kitten like a son of a bitch though. I hate being away from her for a day, nonetheless nine. Only three left though, and she'll be back in my arms, back on my lips, and back in my bed. Tis the season to be in love I suppose. 
     Fuck work. Fuck em all. Fuck the brownie guy who makes me refill his damn water bottle seventeen times a day and then asks for a restroom token every 6 minutes so he can empty his straining bladder. Fuck the crazy bitch and her two iced coffee's, no water, add whipping cream. ""I have a special diet."" Yeah ok, menthols and crack cocaine. Fuck the people who get mad cause their cappucino has all foam. Fuck the people who order a mocha-latte with a straight face. Fuck people who get mad when we don't except their Starbucks cards. See the giant emblem on my apron, the same emblem emblazed five feet long right behind me, the one that says SEATTLE'S BEST COFFEE? Get the fuck out of here. Fuck the guys who get mad because we aren't brewing organic French Roast at the exact time they come in. Fuck the Bev Hills bitches who make me remake their soy non-fat half caf sugar free vanilla latte's four times and then tip me a nickel. 
     I have friends here now. Ruth. Herbie. Matt. Peter. Jay. Milo. Chaz. Ya'll some badass mofuckers. 

Well thats all I have the motivation for right now. Look for more frequent entries as soon as my laptop comes in."

To express the best way I know how, the way that I feel about some things. But its that which I will not do. That which I will not make public. Somewhere, filed away, lie pages of the things I cannot or will not post on here. The things I respect you to much to speak of in such publicly accessible domains. I respect you, because I am you. I am you in all the ways that I should be, I am you in all the things that have ever lacked in me. I am you where I fell short. I am you where I wasn't good enough, or couldn't do it. I would like to think that you are also me. You are me in all the ways that I am you, and in that, we are us. Its a nice feeling, a good thing to fall asleep thinking. The kind of final thought that puts you into the most amazing sleep you've ever had, and makes you wake up thinking it in the morning, smile on your face, girl at your side. I hate to get sappy. You know me, you all know these things about who I am, or who you percieve me to be. I would rather whisper these things in your ear then shout them from rooftops, but thats just because I want to be close to you. You have brought me to life, you have challenged me, made me think, made me better. I can be who I am in your presence, I can say what I want I do what I feel and never worry about the reprecussions because you are mine, and I am yours. We are invested equal parts in this. There is no greater half, no issue where one is more important then the other, and that is what makes us strong. This poorly worded introspective, somewhere along the way, has slipped into a love letter, the kind I don't normally publish. But what the hell, its not every day at least. You have made me more content, more happy, and kept a constant smile on my face then I ever thought possible. I thought I had known what love was, but I'd only had a taste. I'd only known what could have been, and what never was. I finally get to experience what is right, and what is real, and what is true. I believe in love now, I have to, for I live with it every day, in a very real and visceral way.

I love you Ashley D. More then any love I've ever known."

There is a spotlight shining down apon a select few of you, a beacon of self imposed bravado and posture. Do you think we do not see these things, sitting behind our typewriters and notebooks, laptop screens blazing away until the dawn begins to break slowly through the blinds. The cigarette smoke has cleared by then, and its just about time to lay down your head for a few minutes, get some sleep. Soon you will have to report back to that meaningless social service position you call a job. Its a mockery of all we were meant to be, a perversion of truth wearing a four thousand dollar suit and a tie that costs more then I make in a week of pushing hot caffienated beverages on a dreary sleepwalking public.

Its interesting though how many times we've walked off cliffs and given ourselves to the sea over such words of supposed wisdom. A thousand souls crashing against the rocks below for the rest of time, hopeless and cold. Yeah yeah yeah, slit wrists, black hearts, red eye makeup and all that bullshit, but right now, I'm not competing for the xTrophyx. Metaphors aren't always about the lost and the lonely, but sometimes those thoughts can permeate the conciousness, infecting and feeding off all that is good, and all that is clean, until all you have left is bitterness and a lone empty bottle next to you on the floor. The pipes are all cashed, the case of cheap beer ran dry a long time ago. All the women have left this place, nothing intimate has happened here for months. The electricity has been shut off, the water has stopped running. Marlboro 27's smoked through four layers and a sleeping bag still won't keep you warm, but nothing much will in this place.

Oh little brothers, do not look to us for advice. We know not where we are going, and we know not the path to get there. We walk this road in the hopes that something better lays beyond the next roll of the pavement, always something better. Sometimes you don't know what you have until its gone, but some people never had it in the first place, and only dream of the fleeting pleasures taken for granted by so many."

Strong, graceful roots, which onced crept deep into the heart of our Earth and drank of her, trees which have been here for more generations then most can imagine. Trees which lay broken and blistered now, the limbs still smoke and smell of sulfur. Roots which now lay in their unnatural graves above ground. Is it senseless to imagine the irony? That which lives above the earth dies, and is put back to earth. Anything that lives within the earth, dies and is STILL with the earth. It is the same for both, but there will never be anything natural about the death of these things, there will never be anything good about this funeral hymn."

"event","I always get my best ideas right before I fall asleep. In those few hazy moments where reality and dreams mingle and mix, those are the times that I feel the touch of something great. Those are the times that I think of things to write, things to publish, things to pursue. I swear if I could write in my sleep I'd be a self made millionaire by the time I turn 22. Sadly enough, by the time these ideas hit I'm too far gone to motivate myself into sitting up and writing them down, and the one time I tried the thought slipped slowly away with each movement I made towards a pen or a keyboard. The harder I tried to grasp this fleeting moment of gold, the faster it ran like a love letter left in the rain, the characters and words all moving togething in a blur of blue and black. It has begun to drain on me. Its frusterating knowing that there are such good ideas floating around somewhere in my subconcious mind, but I can't quite unlock the door and peer inside.

On the lighter side of things, Mr. Garrett Dart and I did some conversing tonight, through the magic and powerful force of the internets, and the following is excerpts from our discussion, which ranged from such topics as selling people's souls, to birds being a drain on society as a whole.


GARRETT: eh
GARRETT: its finally getting cold
GARRETT: its nice

JESSE: eh...cold weather is for the birds
JESSE: whatever the hell that means
JESSE: why is everything always for the damn birds
JESSE: what did they do to deserve so much

GARRETT: birds need it all

JESSE: birds need NOTHING...except my scorn...i say fuck birds
JESSE: but not in the literal sense

GARRETT: hahah

JESSE: cause having sex with birds is wrong...unless the bird buys you a drink first...then its ok

GARRETT: ya
GARRETT: understandable

JESSE: i figure its a given you know...if a woodland creature buys you a drink, then they are making the first move...except squirrels of course...fuck squirrels...little sluts of the animal kingdom

GARRETT: 2true
GARRETT: you still living in bend?

JESSE: nah...i moved to LA a month ago

GARRETT: ahhh is that town fun?

JESSE: it has its perks...i don't have a car right now cause the goverment took away my license for something called a ""DUI""...whatever that means...so it sucks cause i can't drive around

GARRETT: hahah good times

JESSE: yeah...but other then that its all good...i work in a coffee shop...and make coffee...and sometimes i don't work there...and i drink and smoke things instead




So thats all. Oh, and Garrett says that anybody who reads this, honestly, needs to learn a real mans game.

"event","As I'm sure nobody is aware, I live in Los Angeles. Well, allow me to be technical. I live in La Mirada, which is just outside of LA. The base degredation of this town is incredible. The women with their million dollar smiles (literally), cheeks stretched so tight that the emotions they can show I can count on one hand. Hell I wouldn't even need the whole hand to describe some of these surgical creations. Its a cutthroat town for sure, full of fake smiles so you don't notice the knives held behind the back, hand outstretched in false greeting. I was driving to the theater the other night, on my way to a 10pm showing of Jackass Number Two (you gotta love it), when I witnessed an act that left me stunned. 

      I was stopped in traffic on Beach Boulevard, when I heard screams from the parking lot I was next to. In the parking lot was a yellow VW Bug, one of the new ones that just has none of the personality of the classics. But I digress. A man was rushing around to the passenger side of the car, apparently he was the driver. He swung open the door, and drug the passenger out onto the parking lot, the entire time screaming and yelling at him. ""You motherfucker, I'll fucking kill you! You fucking piece of shit, you fucking bitch!"" He threw the man to the ground and began to stomp on his face. I use the word stomp in a very American History X context. Nothing about the smashing of this man's head was subtle. At this point, the light turned green, and I had to drive forward. There were numerous people in the cars around me quickly dialing cell phones while staring at the parking lot, so I assumed that 9-11 had been called, although I'm sure that the response time of the 5-0 wasn't going to be fast enough for the poor passenger. It was at this point that my girlfriend, sitting next to me looking horrified, said, ""Should we go back and help?"" My immediate thought was FUCK NO. This isn't small town bibleville. People get killed here. Do I need to get myself shot over this? What could I have done to help? The police were on their way. There were witnesses everywhere. How is me going back and risking a confrontation with this psycho going to do anybody any good. 

      I'm not a hero. I'm not interested in seeing my picture on the cover of a newspaper, and I'm not interested in making the obituary page anytime soon. I don't need that warm fuzzy feeling of saving something. Now had it been a women the man was annihilating, maybe I would have felt differently. But I don't feel like being stabbed, shot, or viciously beaten because I had a delusional Good Samaritan moment, in which I felt empowered enough to challenge a man in a blind rage who has already beaten a man nearly if not to death. Am I in the minority here? What would you have done? 

     On the brighter side, theres nothing like seeing a bunch of guys taking shots to the nuts and getting bit by snakes to cheer you up from the reality of life. So go see Jackass."

"event","You know me. I have to write it to believe it. Thats just the way this fucked up head of mine works. Without being able to put it into words, and without being able to write those words down on paper, or type them into technological immortality, its as if they don't exist. Empty ships drifting on seas that nobody will ever see, lost in fog so thick that the lighthouse crumbles and falls into the cold mist, as if giving up on its own purpose. As single minded as the lighthouse can be, it could never match me. I would walk this path for years just to prove you wrong, I would never let myself down, at least as long as I keep my expectations this low. I suppose thats where the innate fear of commitment comes from. I am a man who can barely take care of himself. I get by sure, but its not the life that you dream of when you lay your head to rest at night, its not the life they will write about in People magazine, sandwiched in between the articles about Tom Cruise and his stubborn refusal to be a sane person. Maybe they'll write about me someday, but the words will not be soft, nor will they be kind. Perhaps they'll speak of a misplaced brilliance, perhaps they'll laud my overuse of ages old literary tricks borrowed from the likes of Hemmingway, Gastelum, and Thompson. Perhaps this life of flying under the radar is my destiny. Whatever they say, if they even say it, I don't care. I only want to be remembered. I only want to know that my words reached one life, that the things I wrote connected with one person. Just one. Thats all I need. Not that it wouldn't be nice to sell a few million copies of something, but hell, start small right?"

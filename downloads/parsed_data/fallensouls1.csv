"event","consisted of me being in south Jersey w/ the fam...came down Sat w/ my sis...on the way home we're on the parkway in the left lane, there's hella traffic & this poor dog goes limping by us on the yellow line, very badly hurt, uh it was so sad...so we pulled over & waited for a half hr till the police came but the dick pulled into the median & proceeded to use the loudspeaker to ask us if we were in ana accident....we shout back NOOO like 3 times, A DOG GOT HIT! then a 4runner driving by w punkass kids going by shouts out idiots, whatever, we were gonna wait there till we knew the dog was being looked for....finally we call the humane society & they said they were sending sum1 out there. So we leave, get home, sum family came over...we all sat out on the porch & just chilled, had cocktails & such...so there's been this family of bunnies in our huge backyard, they're so cute, like 2 nests...but htere's this ""outdoor"" cat, UH i hate it...in the middle of usrelaxing outside we see it go into our yard and get a baby bunny! so we like screamed at it, i try to hop the fence, but it took off...i was so upset, i mean cmon like 1st the dog then the bunny. So it wasnt really the best day for me.
Sunday we go to see family(same that were over Sat) & they live on the bay. it was very relaxing, then Kathy put on this Kalipso music, very cool. she's freakin Martha Stewart, made all this good stuff including fresh Mango margerritas mmmmmmmmmmmmm. i got drunk lalalalalala
then we shot this potato gun thing that made them go soooo high, like hundreds of feet into the air. then around 6 we leave Ashley goes back up to the apt shortly after, i decide to stay for a couple more days cuz i dont have this 1 interview till Wed. so then i take a nap get up, get ready around 8 & leave for Long beach island to my friend Tom's beach house, get down there, NO PARKING! the fireworks are starting while i'm in my car, but whatever, i finally get a spot, and go see my Radiohead friends, very fun...all Tom's friends are there, all pretty cool, but i had been drinking all day & had to drive back so i made my couple last. i broke out my guitar & played a bit, alot of Ours tunes & the Geico spot by request which was fun. met this cute girl who is actually Tom's ex & i had no idea till later...after we went to the beach...i mean Tom's gf was there & i didn't think anything of it...he was actually all like if guys are gonna make out can i watch? lol but then this girl starts running and dragging me...i mean she was so full of energy which i like...we lost them...and eventually just chilled, ok well more than just chilled but not too much, i just met the girl. but she's as weetheart, so that was fun, got back to the house, every1 was asleep, i had to drive home, was not really looking forwardto that but whatever...i got home at like 4am. oops.
Then yesterday just kinda hung around, errands, blah, same today...beautiful out...but i think i might be having asthma issues, i'm thinking positive tho. so that's basically it. my 4th weekend.
peace"

"event","oh how cute...a lil cairn terrier...here's what happened...Ash & i were sooo craving the company of a puppy so be4 she got off work i looked up a few spots and we headed out to ""shake a paw"" puppies when she got back.
1st one i saw was her...ears went back n all. she loved me and i loved her, Ashley loved her too...she went in her arms and just loooved my sis. we took her in a playroom & what fun! she looks like a lil hedgehog...black, grey, and white hair mix, w/ a lil tan...SO ADORABLE (ima prolly be sayin that alot) & i'll get pics soon.
so u can imagine that when we hadda leave i was so upset...bugged my parents from night till the morning...they were so set on not getting her, plus they hadn't even seen her. next morning i tried 1 last time be4 i had to get ready for NY. about to leave and my phone rings, it's my Mom...""we're gonna get this lil girl for our family cuz you found her and that's the way it should be, when a member of the family finds one and knows it's right."" uh, this is where my Mom is so cool, cuz she can see the positive. So i had to walk to the train station knowing both my parents were gonna meet me later to pick me up at the station then go get ""her"".
Great meeting in NY, good good stuff, actually this company is branching off another new company specifically for young ""Edgy"" artists!!! exactly what i'm looking to do. very cool. may take a lil time to come together but i think would be perfect for me. was very good i went to see them, what timing with this new branch!
k so i'm on the train all excited coming back knowing that the lil one is waiting for us. we go back to the apt(my parents & i) to chill while my sis finishes up at work. then she calls, we leave & she leaves work to meet us at the puppy place. we get there 1st she pulls up, we're all soooo excited...go in, walk over, get to about 5 ft. from the cage and i point(keep in mine the folks hadn't seen her yet)...and my Mom goes nuts, immediately starts crying just as she sees her, she LOVES her. so does my Dad. oh just good stuff! they take her outta the cage and put in my Dad's arms then my Mom's, they love her. play area, she hops & bounds, soooo cute. take care of legistics, like $760 worth of legistics lol then take her back to Ash's apt. WHAT FUN...she's running around, investigating, just loving all of us. finally around 7:30ish we say goodbye to my sis and i go home w/ the puppy and my parents. she really adjusted well the house, actually slept in the crate the whole ride home. man she's got spunk, what a sweet lil girl.
haven't named her yet, coupla thoughts tho are...Bella(beautiful), Robin, and Glory.
so i'm here for the weekend, tired already."

   i love that my fingertips are messed up from playing guitar, that's a good thing. got an e-mail back from Jim at Netcetra, the view guestbook is finally up w/ 18 posts, so i sent him the other 30 that have since come for him to add to the list. Hope it won't take another 2 weeks for that to get up. We'll see, but i'm glad that was taken care of. it was really nice out earlier and now it's kinda dreary...at least i was out alot today and got the things i needed to while the weather was good, can't complain. i will now go see my horoscope for today. i can't help but notice the soft pine tree out front, the branches are full and are swaying out of synch with each other, but it's still this gentle motion from the wind. just an observation...no i'm not stoned, just observant ;)"

"event","It's been a lil while since this has happened, but i tend to see spiders at night after i wake suddenly, mostly crawling on the wall, sometimes on a hanging from a strand of their own web & then coming right at me, once i blink my eyes a few times they're not there or they slowly dissipate, lol being that this has caused me on several occasions to throw myself outta my bed, i decided to look the issue up on a dream analogy site, this was the description...



To see a spider spinning a web in your dream, signifies that you will be rewarded for your hard work. You will soon find yourself promoted in your job or recognized for your achievement in a difficult task.  Spiders are a symbol of creativity due to the intricate webs they spin. On a negative note, spiders may indicate a feeling of being entangled or trapped in a sticky or clingy relationship. It represents some ensnaring and controlling force. You may feel that someone or some situation is sucking the life right out of you. 

To see a spider climbing up a wall in your dream, denotes that your desires will be soon be realized. 

To dream that you are bitten by a spider, represents a conflict with your mother or some dominant female figure in your life. The dream may be a metaphor for a devouring mother or the feminine power to possess and entrap. Perhaps you are feeling trapped by some relationship."

everything got done today despite the rain, went out on my bike an all. post office to mail Aimee a care package, after all if i had a broken pelivic bone i know i'd want sum nice mail. then to the gym where a nice guy named Mark showed me sum cool exercises, it all started when he asked if he could switch off w me on this 1 machine, soo nice this guy, actually he was a personal trainer in Florida but now is a computer tech, but soo nice which made his pretty face even prettier, so that was cool to make a friend at the gym, i couldn't help but wonder if he was gay or not, this was a hard 1, and i have gaydar that is ALWAYS in check! hhmmm we'll see about that 1.
i'm realizing that i like it when people look right into my eyes when talking to me, it's very reassuring.
uuh, drumline is on AGAIN, i'm so over it, y can't they play old scool movies that i like instead of these stupid teenie bopper movies, the lead in this reminds me of a guy i used to date in college my fresh yr. be4 i really started to spend my time exclusively w/ girls haha it's ironic cuz Stefen was a drummer at Berklee, and the best too...we used to slow dance in his room, wow i had forgotten about that...maybe that's y i liked him, cuz he was the kind to do sumthing like that...
i haven't slow danced in so long let alone in sum1's room, that would be nice for a change but what would be really nice...to have a girl in my life, altho it's cool to date, i'd be lying if i said i wouldn't like a gf. k now i'm gonna get depresssed so i'll stop on that subject, after all i've been asexual lately so.

"event","so yesterday came home w/ Ash...things were nice, kinda chill, my Dad came home, we celebrated Easter then cuz we wanted to. not that we're religious but we just like the things that come with it...so we all exchanged cute Easter cards, we got the parents a nice lil candle thing, Nikki was on her way from the beach so she got here about a 1/2 hr after my Dad got here...oh ya, lol Ashley & i had gone out early to get cards but stayed out driving around, just talking about old flames etc. but when we got to Hallmark there was this chic standing outside of the store next to it that i knew from last yr, i didn't wanna talk to her cuz she's a lil nutty, but couldn't help remembering how she pushed me into a stall in the bathrm at the FoHo last yr to make out w me LOL too funny. so we walked past, i just kept talkin and lookin ahead, whew...
   Nikki & i hung out here till we got ready to go to the FoHo 4 a lil...got there a lil early, the lights were still on, blah, but then the lights went off, band came on, people started comin in, and damn i think every1 i graduated w was there lol, told them about the commercial, alot had seen it, so that was cool...my friend Ryan kept comin up to us & jokin around w/ Nikki askin her sex questions, he was really makin me laugh, & she would just be a bitch right back to him so it was even more funny, so we had a good time, i do hate it tho when she does the whole i think this guy is cute blah blah blah shit...cuz it's obvious she's just doin it to see if i'll get pissed, but i don't give a shit!!! do what u want...so irritating. then, ok & this was the best, this girl Morgan comes up to me & we're talkin, Nikki i could tell was jealous, whatever, i'm not dating u & even if i was i can talk to sum1 for cryin out loud! but anyway, Nikki goes into the bathroom, i'm talkin to this girl, uuh so hot, she's bein all flirty, love it...she's very ditzy when she's drunk BUT this girl is hella funny so i was really laughin at her stories, she had been in LA for a lil, came back recently...
Nikki comes outta the bathroom & this girl is like um heeheee um so what r u doing 4 Easter? i'm all oh just dinner w the family, so she goes well we're havin like a big thing at 12 so if u wanna come over, and i can feel Nikki gettin all uncomfortable so i gave her my # and that was that...wasn't that big of a deal so whatever. 
   Talked to Jimmy's brother Mike and he almost immediately asked me if he's bi, so even tho i'm not friends w Jimmy anymore and he was an ass to me i still covered 4 him & was like nah Jimmy likes girls, trust me, it's prolly just cuz he was hangin w me that ur hearin things cuz i would take hime to gay clubs, & i said this even tho it was the opposite way around, Jimmy was always draggin me out to those clubs all of last yr. but whatever i'm not gonna blow his spot(no pun intended) just cuz i don't talk to him anymore...which by the way i still can't get over how bad it was what he did, tryin to start shit out in Cali w Aimee, after IIIIII put u in touch w her in the 1st place to help ur career and make new friends, i can't even imagine doing sumthing like that, man that was like 7th grade shit, for real, but the fact that he told her i didnt like her music & that i need to get over her? oooo man he lost me there. just glad Aimee was mature enuf to see past that, & that the only reason he was tryin to start shit was cuz he didn't have anything else to talk about w her, and so he had the audacity to make up stuff about me to try to buddy up w her. well he lost my friendship and hers & Aimee and i are still close so he just made things worse 4 himself.
   ANYWAY...now it's Easter sunday, my my Mom is making this HUGE meal, turkey, the whole nine. I'm glad Nikki didn't try anything last nite when she stayed over, i mean it was nice to just snuggle but that's it. so all together it's beena good weekend, i'm just anxious to get goin this week w/ everything about my career...hoping this week will be a productive one! oh yes and watching the Yankees of course...so i'm automatically in a good mood!"

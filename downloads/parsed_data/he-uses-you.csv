"event","so vegas was very, very awesome.  i cant believe i havent updated about it yet.  we saw SO MUCH but there was also SO MUCH that we didnt get to see.  i have over a hundred pics of it that i desperately need to upload.  it was a blast.. gambling, drinking, sightseeing.  i definitely didnt win anything besides a little bit here and there (which i ended up blowing)and neither did chris, but j won EVERYTHING he played. he left with the same amount he came with!! lucky!!  surprisingly we didnt get drunk like we thought we would.  i was definitely tipsy once or twice, but thats it.  i want to go back SO bad!!

today was mine and j's 6 month anniversary!  well, technically not an anniversary since it hasnt been a year yet, but what else do you call it?  i think that half a year is pretty significant.  we are doing great still.. i feel so lucky to have found him.  

we're still saving up for tampa and working towards that.  we've pretty much decided on the place we want to live so now we just need to fill out the application and get on the waiting list.. something we're trying to do by the end of this week.

in other news school is dragging on.  actually time has been flying by, but the last few weeks of school are always hectic.  i have a test tomorrow in genetics that i'll be up all night studying for.  and i have a bunch of other projects accumulating for the next few weeks.

i am going home this weekend for easter and to see my sister. she'll be 32 weeks pregnant this saturday, its so crazy!  i havent seen her since christmas so i am way excited about that.  other than that, not much new."

"event","only 3 more days til spring break and vegas!! i am so excited, but it still hasnt sunk in that i am actually going.  i dont think it will until thursday night.  j and i have read all about it and found out some awesome deals, particularly for food.  i am also excited for my first plane right, albeit nervous.  im happy that i wont be doing it alone, though.  so we leave thursday night around 8 when j gets off of work.  we have to drive 4.5 hours to my house and our flight leaves out of norfolk at 6:15am on friday.  

i dont really have time to be excited yet, well at least not until wednesday.  today is going to be busy as hell.  i had a test at 8am this morning, then my class at 9:30 was thankfully cancelled.  now i just have two more classes at 12:30 and 2pm, and im done by 3:15.  then i get to write a character analysis that's due tomorrow in class, and go hear a speaker at 7:30.  then its off to work 9:30-3:30am.  i'll be so relieved once i turn in that paper tomorrow.  i am so fed up with school, i just want out.

in other news, j and i have been researching apartments in the tampa area.  at first, we made a list of the ones we liked in tampa, but then i went to a website where residents can write reviews about the places.. and lets just say that none of them sounded desirable.  im not trying to have my car vandalized and broken into, or live with mold/termites.  eww.  so we've started looking at apartments in brandon, which is right outside of tampa.  i feel so much better about these ones, plus one of my friends used to live there and said it was much safer and nicer than tampa.  so our biggest obstacle now is to find a place that will allow his dog who weighs about 55 pounds.  most places wont accept such big dogs, so he's calling around today to find out the pet policies.  

oh, my sister is 25 weeks pregnant now.. i cant wait to be an aunt!! :)

i'll update after vegas.. im sure i'll have a lot to say!"

"event","j and i have been researching apartments in tampa this past week.  we found some places we really liked.. then i checked out what the residents had to say at this one website with reviews.. damn.. a lot of our choices just went down the drain!  most of the places have mold/termites/and lots of crime.  oh well.. we'll keep searching i guess..  i think it'd be best to rent a house, though.  i checked out the newspaper there and there seem to be a lot of listings, so we can check that the closer we get to july.

in july, we are taking a week off.. the first half of the week, we'll go to north carolina because my family gets a beach house there every year.. the second half, we'll go to tampa to see potential houses/apartments/condos.  i am so excited!

in other news, school is going ok so far.  this semester actually seems to be flying by!  i have a test and a presentation this week, both on tuesday.  other than that, its pretty chill.  work is the same as ever, but i am making lots more per paycheck since i got another raise :)  and less than 2 weeks til vegas! i cant wait!!"

"event","so trying to get my shit together...

i found out today that the max. amount of credits i can take over the summer is 18.. which is perfect.  but that also means that i cant drop any classes (im taking 18 credits right now) and there is no room for fuck-ups.  18 credits is exactly the amount i need to take this summer.. so i need to really buckle down and do well this semester.

i feel so liberated knowing that i'll be moving out of va in just 7 months.  its still a long time, but i cant help but be excited.  i joined <lj comm=tampa> to find out more info on the area and the people have been so awesome/helpful. :)

so 22 days til im drinking free drinks and gambling my money away in vegas!  i have never been out west, well.. further west than oklahoma which i guess is considered midwest.  i am going to take crazy amounts of pictures.. its gonna be insane!!  speaking of pics, i should include more in my posts.. here's one i took a few days ago while waiting for j in the car... 


<img src=http://myspace-829.vo.llnwd.net/00488/92/82/488542829_l.jpg>

awesome..

so yeh, im pulling an all-nighter tonight.  why is it so much harder to do now than it was freshman year?  i mean, am i really getting THAT old? haha.. 18 seems so long ago.  well.. gotta get going and finish some homework/read/organize.. im gonna start updating more from now on!!  :)"

"event","so for those of you who care.. i decided to do an update. its crazy...

so first of all.. my life monday-thursday consists of school and work.
i am taking 18 credits this semester, one of which is an online class.
i have one class on mon/weds, and <b>4</b>
on tues/thurs!! not to mention that the first one is at 8am, and the
rest follow pretty consecutively with an hour or so of break at like
11am. so after dealing with classes, i work mon-thurs nights. it all
pays off on friday, though.. no classes/no work.. same for the weekend.
its pretty awesome.

next topic..j. well, i met this guy, j, at work back in april. we
started dating in october and we're still together. his name is jason,
but he goes by j. so things are going awesome for us. i just cant even
explain how happy he makes me and how much fun we have together. its
kind of scary, but i really do believe that he's ""the one"". i spend
insane amounts of time with him.. usually about 4-5 nights i spend the
night at his place. sometimes i wonder why i pay rent here, haha.. so
for the first time in a long while i am truly happy. for once i am in a
relationship that is filled with only positive emotions; i dont have
any reason to worry or feel jealous or not trust him. it feels damn
good.

for spring break, i am going to VEGAS!! i'll be accompanied by the
awesome <lj user=kyzen>, as well as j.  and possibly another one of <lj user=kyzen>'s
friends. how is that coming along anyways, chris? so we're going march
3-8 and i couldnt be more excited!! (well im sure i'll be more excited
the closer we get :p) i have never flown before! can anyone believe
that?! wow, i am kinda nervous i have to admit.. but at least j will be
there with me. we're staying at the stratosphere and we're gonna be
drunkedy-drunk-drunk most of the time! haha..hey, free drinks to
gamble? sure!

here's another awesome piece of news.. i graduate in august!! yes, i
wish i could graduate on time in may, but i am a semester behind.. at
least i wont have to go through another ""full"" semester. i'd rather do
summer sessions anyways; the classes are easier and faster. ok.. now
for the big, big news...

i am moving to tampa! i know i said it would be new york.. but
seriously.. tampa. i am moving there in september, and guess who is
coming with? j! yes, we're going to move in together. its so exciting.
i have already started searching apartments and jobs. i am sure i will
use lj to keep track of things and update everyone on the process.. but
for now i guess i'll go finish up some homework!!</lj-user></lj-user>"

a lot has changed, a lot has stayed the same.

john and i broke up :/ so whats new, right? that was near the end of august, i just havent felt like updating about it.. i guess i didnt want to accept it. ive done so much for him.. more than i think i have ever done for anyone. maybe i was hoping there was some way i could get him back.. to make him see how much i care for him and how good i could be for him. maybe.

well, maybe has been my hope for damn near 3 months now. i havent been able to have any other relationships due to him. i just cant move on.. for some reason, this feels different. it feels like i shouldnt give up on him. i keep telling myself to just let go, and really i have come a long way.. but i just cant completely cut him out of my life.

we still talk every day."

"event","my roommate/best friend has been co-oping in maryland all summer.  her older brother (25) has been living in her room all summer.. we recently moved to our new 2 bedroom apartment and unfortunately he moved into her room (she's still in maryland). he moves out on friday, and it cant come soon enough.

he is the most filthy and disrespectful person i have ever lived with.  i wish i could kick him out, and even looking at him disgusts me.  here's why:

1. he blasts his music.  and its not even good music, either.. its shitty techno music.  everyone knows that of all the types of music, that is the one i truly dispise.  i dont think he has the ability to listen to it at a normal, human volume.  in our previous apartment, he played it so loud that it took one of my other roommates 5 minutes of knocking on the door before he heard her.  he plays this shit at ALL hours of the day/night, including early morning when i am trying to sleep.  at least once a day, i tell him to turn the shit down, of course i ask politely.. but its getting harder and harder to do.

2. he doesnt clean up after himself.  at the former apartment, he had an overflowing sinkful of dishes.  none of them were mine, nor my other roommate's.  she even taped a note up asking for them to be washed.  after about a week of them still sitting there, guess who washed them? me.  and now at the new apartment.. guess what?  another sinkful of his dirty dishes.  i make it a point to wash only mine, and pile his into the sink.  not to mention i already spent 10 minutes scrubbing the stovetop from his messy cooking.  i sure as hell am not washing his shit.  here's the kicker:  we have a dishwasher (that i dont intend to use b/c it wastes electricity).. so he takes the time to load all his dirty dishes in there, and then never even washes them.. he even takes the time to rinse them off first.  so i find them in there, take them out and put them back into the sink.  and then i cut the breaker for the dishwasher so he cant use it.  and he comes to ask if the dishwasher doesnt work.. i tell him that i dont want to waste electricity, and he says oh ok.. he still hasnt washed any of them.

3. he wastes electricity.  in my former apartment, rent included everything.. there were no seperate bills for electricity or anything.  well, in the new place, we have to pay electricity.  he leaves lights on all the time, used to turn the ac down before i asked him to leave it where it was, was planning on using the dishwasher, and he has about 3 computers hooked up in his room that are constantly running (he works with computers).

4. he smokes weed in the apartment.  he also did this in the old place.  its not that hard to go out on the balcony and do it.  personally, i hate the smell of it.. thats why i dont want him doing it inside.

5. he has nasty bathroom habits.  HE PEES WITH THE FUCKING DOOR OPEN. how fucking nasty is that?  ive noticed him doing it 3 times.  he needs to understand that he lives with a girl, not with a bunch of nasty guys.  also, he blows his nose in the shower... nasty.

I HATE HIM.  honestly, after having to live with him all summer.. i really feel hatred towards him.  i cant fucking wait until the POS moves out."

so i just finished another one of the projects.. that means that i have 4 more to do. they are due by tomorrow at midnight.. so pretty much i have 23 hours to complete the other 4. i am halfway done with the next one.. and i am NOT spending tomorrow night doing fuckin humanities. so i am shooting to finish 2 more tonight, and the other 2 tomorrow during the day.

this is what i get for procrastinating, but i never learn. i do this all the time and tell myself next time will be different; it never is. i'll be in the same boat at the end of next summer session, haha. :)"

SIIIIGHHHHHHHH.  ugh.. 

i almost wish that instead of working and taking 6 credits each session, that i wouldve not worked and taken 12 credits this session.. then i could go home for the rest of the summer and even work at water country again (i miss that place like CRAZY). oh well, i have a job, i should be happy about that, though i am going to need to start looking for another one b/c the hours/pay at this one just isnt cutting it.

john and i are doing well.. i just miss him like crazy.  im not sure when the next time i'll see him will be.. sometime in july (its already been a month!) whenever our schedules can cooperate.

im happy about going home this weekend.. NONE of my friends, with the exception of one, are here.. they all went home for the summer :/ i need some human contact, haha.. and i get to see my kitties, i miss them, too."

april is officially hell month. school is kicking my ass. this is the hardest fucking year i have had, yet. last week i got 2 tests out of the way, so its a little better now, but i still have a lot of work to do. i have a philosophy paper due this friday, 2 papers and a group project due next week, and 2 papers and an exam the week after that. FUCK THAT SHIT.

i am so tired of being here. i am tired of being in school. i am tired of being in virginia. 

the end of this semester is like a light at the end of a long ass tunnel. and it cant come soon enough. college sucks.

the one thing to make it all better, though.. is new york. i am going there on the 29th of this month.. i am so hyped about this trip. have i mentioned john before? i dont know.. but he's this guy i met on myspace, he has a band in new york and they are playing that weekend.. that's the reason i am making the trip. and well, john and i have been ""talking"" for over a month now.. i cant wait to see him. yeh, thats my exciting news.

my sister up and moved to california about 2 weeks ago to be with her boyfriend. i wish i could do that.. just take off.. i wish i had no responsibilities here."

especially when my team wins! anyone see the game? we just beat the hell out of georgia tech! an 80 yard touchdown, 25 point COMEBACk in the 4th quarter!! hell yes. we just broke so many stereotypes about vt football.

1st, the 2nd half syndrome aka playing football the first part of the season and becoming the ""chokies"" during the last half. next, we are NOT a road team. and we are NOT a comeback team. hahaha. fucking right!

i am so happy!! 

final score: vt34 - gt20"

"event","today in abnormal psyc this transsexual girl came to speak to us. it was really interesting, learned a lot. well, i knew most everything, but i still have an appreciation for people who go through that. she's a former guy who's now taking female hormones and transitioning while living as a girl. at a college campus, that takes a lot. she was talking about all the ridicule she faces and all of the precautions she has to take. man, makes me feel bad. its weird because i used to talk to her on yahoo all the time like a year ago, she found my name and started msging me. she's pretty cool so i think i'll start talking to her more often.

in other news... last night at like 1am i applied online to best buy. and i awoke this morning to a phone call from best buy. haha, gotta love that quickness. so i had an interview there today. went well, looks promising... and i have the second interview on friday! awesome, but the only bad thing is its a 45 minute drive. i think its worth it though, best buy is the shit anyways.

damn, i cant stop playing with my tongue ring! its addictive. ;)

oh yeh, figured out my halloween costume! saran wrap. hehehe, should be fun and i will def take pictures to post."

"event","today was a pretty productive day for me.

feeling like shit, i skipped my only class of the day this morning.. i have a sore throat, still.. but at least the headache and aching went away.

so i went to get my transmission fluid changed in my car. took about 2 hours, but i think it was well worth it. my car runs better now. next on the agenda for my car is brakes and an oil change. i need to get both of those things done pretty soon, within the next month.

oh yeh, i had a job interview for work on campus yesterday. i filled out a bunch of papers including tax return info... so i pretty much have the job. i just have to wait for the woman to email me about scheduling!! yay for money.

also, course request opened today. so i requested the classes i want for next semester. if i get what i want, i'll have all my classes on tuesday and thursday. that would be so awesome. but, i am taking 18 credits, so we'll see. too bad i have to wait til december to find out what i get. here's what i requested:

PHIL 1304: Morality and Justice
PHIL 1204: Knowledge and Reality
ART 2386: Survey of Historical Western Art
BIOL 2704: Evolutionary Biology
PSYC 2074: Animal Behavior
PSYC 2054: Psyc of Personality

the philosophy classes are required for psyc majors, as well as the bio class. art class is a core requirement, and the other 2 psyc classes are of course for psyc majors as well.

tomorrow i have an exam in statistics, so i guess i better start studying for that... this week is shaping up well! :)"

"event","im sooooo happy! a big weight has been lifted off my shoulders :D  i was worried about housing for spring semester when i go back to tech. i hadnt heard anything about it, so i decided to call them up. the woman said my housing contract had been deactivated since i didnt return in the fall, but she reactivated it and told me that i can check hokiespa in dec/early jan to find out my assignment :D  and i will definately have one. 

i actually feel productive, lately. ive been applying to a lot of places, getting a lot of chores done, etc. and now that i have everything squared away for tech, it just adds to the list.

im getting so fired up for the game on saturday. all i have to do is go to the college football message boards on espn.com and it does the trick. i get so pissed off and ready to kick some ass. look for me on espn in blacksburg saturday night!!

its just now starting to get cold here and the leaves are starting to finally change. i hear its ass numbingly cold in bburg right now. good, i hope it snows during the game, now i'll have an excuse to wear my vt earwarmer.

tonight im going to the mall to turn in my application for victoria's secret. now THAT'S the job i hope i get. discounts there would be awesome!"

"event","i went up to subway station, the one across from cnu (for those familiar with the area), and picked up an application. they're hiring. i sat through 5 light cycles b/4 i could finally make a left turn. damn 5 o' clock traffic on warwick blvd. it made me mad. i considered moving back out of the turn lane, but a big cox cable van pulled up behind me, blocking my vision and putting the pressure on me to turn. anyways, i filled the app out in about 5min. i'll turn it in tomorrow. 

i just got back from seeing scary movie 3 with my dad, bro, and uncle. damn, THAT was a FUNNY movie. i would recommend it to anyone. of course, it helps if you've seen a lot of recent movies, but either way..i didnt stop laughing for an hour and a half. i could've done without all the sexual ineundos, but guys i guess there's another reason for you to go.

im waiting for my friend john to get here so we can go to wallyworld. i need to buy a bulletin board and some white knee socks for my halloween costume. speaking of halloween, i cant wait to be up at tech! only 4 more days!! i hope we beat the living shit out of miami."

"event","hm...i think i want a nice sexy guy with facial hair. yes, that sounds nice. maybe i'll find him up at tech.

i drove for 5 straight hours last night. i was right by tech, but didnt go up there. it was for grandpa's funeral. it went ok, we just got lost a lot.

i signed up for next semester's classes last night. here's what i HOPE i get:
REL 1024: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam
ENGL 2744: Intro to Creative Writing
HIST 1214: History of the Modern World
PSYC 2034: Developmental Psychology
PSYC 2084: Social Psychology

so, hopefully i will get these classes. yes, i realize that some are first level, but i still have to fulfill some of my area requirements. that would be the dream schedule, tho. 2 psyc classes, and im in heaven.

tonight is the tech v. wvu game. sorry <lj user= journal_saurus>, but im thinking that my team is going to demolish yours. they better, we cant afford to lose to wvu the week before playing miami. that would be a slap in the face.

speaking of miami, i cant wait til nov. 1st! halloween will be a wild time up there, too, but the game is gonna be out of control. i have a strong feeling that we're going to surprise miami and most of the country that night. we are going to pull something, watch. we'll win somehow. plus, we have the home field advantage. is anyone else as excited about this game as i am?"

"event","the michelle branch concert last night was awesome. dakona and pat mcgee were the openers. we got there a little late, so missed dakona, but pat mcgee is a band out of richmond that does covers. they did this one pink floyd song that was so good. one of the guys was soo talented on the tenor sax.. made me want to reconsider the idea of buying one of my own. i really miss playing. then michelle branch blew everyone away. her voice is so amazing. im going to buy her new cd, def.

then we (my sister went with me) got lost in norfolk for about half an hour. we couldnt find the 264 entrance, and when we did, we went the wrong way on it. also, we stopped at wendy's on the way home and i tried their chili for the first time, its pretty good.

in about an hour i'll be going to hooters, because its tuesday night. that means all you can eat wings! why does every guy think its weird when i say im going to hooters? IM NOT GOING FOR THE GIRLS. who, by the way, most of which do not possess hooters..but thats a different story. i just love wings. and if there was another place around here specializing in wings, i would go there instead. we need a buffalo wild wings here, just like in blacksburg. there needs to be a restaurant for girls, like a male version of hooters. shirtless men would be fine..they dont even have to wear skimpy shorts."

(John Mayer)

*Yourself:
""someday i'll fly
someday i'll soar
someday i'll be so damn much more
cause i'm bigger than my body gives me credit for""

*Your mom:
""i want to live in the center of a circle
i want to live on the side of a square 
i'd love to walk to where we both can talk but
i've got to leave you cause my ride is here

home life
you keep the home life
you take the home life
i'll come back for the home life
i promise""

*Your dad:
""on behalf of every man
looking out for every girl
you are the god and the weight of her world

so fathers, be good to your daughters
daughters will love like you do""

*Your first best friend:
""by the time i recognize this moment
this moment will be gone
but i will bend the light pretending
that it somehow lingered on

and i will wait to find
if this will last forever
and i will wait to find
if this will last forever
and i will wait to find
that it won't and it won't because it can't
it just can't
it's not supposed to""

*Your current best friend:
""stop trying to figure it out
deep will only bring you down""


*Your Ex: 
""all you need is love is a lie cause
we had love but we still said goodbye
now we're tired, battered fighters

and it stings when its nobody's fault
cause there's nothing to blame at the drop of your name
its only the air you took and the breath you left""

*Your first true love:
""still is the life
of your room when you're not inside
and all of your things
tell the sweetest storyline
your tears on these sheets
and your footsteps are down the hall
tell me what i did
i can't find where the moment went wrong at all

you can be mad in the morning
i'll take back what i said
just don't leave me alone here
its cold, baby""

*Your current love (if you have one):
""its so hard to be so far out
living our separate lives
your phone was really broken
i tried your number twice
if you need confirmation, baby i understand

its alright if you want me to 
tell you you

you got my only heart
yah, you got my only heart
yah, you got my only
only heart"""

well, i can say that i definately feel 19 now. this is maybe the first time i've actually felt like its time for me to turn the age im turning, if that makes any sense. 18 was a rite of passage, i think, 19 seems like a more responsible, ""adult"" age. 

so far, today has been great! im going out to eat with my dad at 4, then all i have to do is go visit my grama, then comes the drinking!! yay..im looking forward to that. one cool thing about today is that i now have 2 tickets to see michelle branch monday night at the norva! yay! i'll update later tonight, maybe.  :D"

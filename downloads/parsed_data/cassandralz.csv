I, quite honestly, feel like I'm finally awake after sleeping for 3 months or more.  Maybe a lot more.  I dunno who hit the reset button in my system, but I am grateful.  The flipped switch feeling is more than a little unnerving, but I'll take what I can get, I guess?

This summer so far has been very different.  My apartment is kept at about 75-76 degrees, 85 degree weather does not bother me... and it was probably about 92-94 when I walked to the metro station tonight and I didn't break out into much of a sweat.  Very warm, yes, but not unbearable.

Last summer, and all summers before that, anything 80 or above was way too hot.  My living and working spaces didn't need to be any warmer than 72.  My roommates kept the place pretty frigid all summer, but other than pretty cold feet, I never thought twice about it.

How things change.

Back to my reset button - I didn't realize how a constant lack of energy like, sucks the life out of things.  That sounds silly, but... didn't realize how much I wasn't doing until I started doing it again.  Yeah.

I don't have much else to say except that I hope it lasts.  Getting through my workday without feeling like death.  Working on getting the rest of the boxes I still have chillin from when I moved months ago unpacked.  Trying to keep my place more cleaned up than I usually manage to.  I have plants out on the balcony I'm trying very hard not to kill.  I finally got my piano keyboard unpacked tonight.  Life is good."

"event","Things that I have learned recently, include but are not limited to:

1.  Bad things happen when you set a mostly empty milkshake on the roof of your car to get something out of the back seat, and the wind blows.

2.  Dishwashers can and will attempt to flood your kitchen.

3.  If you can't catch the mouse in your current apartment, move, and catch a different one there!

4.  Much of your life is dictated by where you define the role various emotions play in it.

5.  Sometimes it makes more sense to throw yourself under the bus, rather than have someone else throw you under the bus.

6.  It is entirely possible to trip over a bird when it's too stupid to figure out you're walking right toward it.

7.  Some motorcycle riders think it's a cool idea to try to sideswipe your car going over 100 miles an hour.  What they fail to realize is that A, I may have a heart attack, and B, they may lose their head in the process.  Literally.  Next time bad things could happen.

8.  Warm temperatures and a nice breeze - just about the best combination of things ever.

9.  This too shall pass.

10.  Hockey might actually be kind of interesting.  Kind of like baseball is kind of interesting.

11.  It's ok to have no idea what's going on.

12.  Sleep before 2 AM is a smart idea."

In that context death and life happen every moment of your day.

It's closer to the computer and therefore a little warmer, and it's also out of any draft on the floor.

Today apparently this was a bad idea, as I noticed while I was showering tonight...  The point that the shelf above where my feet were hit my leg, I currently have some serious indents in my skin that aren't going away (isn't that kind of odd to begin with?), and the ankle below that point is now a bit swollen and hurts to touch.

I've learned so much about life over the last few years.  It's really impressive when I step back and think about it.

The latest lesson for me is that life never lets you sit back and relax.  Even when you think you're on cruise control, you're not.

I used to joke about how in my family all we know is crisis mode, since we end up having to bounce from one to the next.  And that oddly is pretty true.  Maybe we just have bad luck.  It's always something!

Last year over christmas I was so excited when I was heading up there 'cause i was thinking I could just relax... no dice.

I'm going to have a hard time relaxing this christmas, too... although I suppose that depends on what comes out of the drs appointment I have on the 19th, before I go home.  I still have crap to deal with any way I go about it, it's just a matter of degree.  

I'm gonna cross my fingers for the less crap option, and hope I can have a worry-free vacation!

I really work hard at keeping myself upbeat and moving forward in my life.  The past is what it is, and the present is entirely what you make of it, and you can't determine the future with any kind of certainty, so you make the best decisions you can with whatever you have in front of you and just go with it and hope for the best.

Granted I am not always positive and I have long strings of time that I feel very much under water and it's a struggle on a daily basis to keep myself going, let alone that whole positive and upbeat thing.  But the key issue there is at least I'm always trying.

I think I'm having a rough time right now because I feel like I'm halfway up this huge mountain... except I realize as I'm walking, that there's this other mountain across the way that I should be climbing, not this one.  And I don't know if I should keep climbing this one, climb back down and start climbing the other one, or stop somehow and see if I can't bend the forces of nature until the two mountains combine themselves so I can just climb both.

Because that's really at all possible.  Mmhmm."

Friday all hell breaks loose :-)

But!!  Until then, I have two days this week that I'm DONE at 5:30 and don't have to THINK about anything until 8:30 the next morning.  Which is all sorts of awesome.  I don't even have to be studying.  Crazy.

Tomorrow there's a ""networking"" thing after dinner till 9:45 PM.  I kinda don't want to go, but networking is sorta important to my job, so I should.

In not work news...  I'm still working on this perpetual thing that is me trying to get my life together.  Someday I'll get it right.

Thanksgiving is soon!  Holidays sneak up on me.

It's national novel writing month.  I don't do so well with that whole writing thing.  As evidenced by how rarely I even write here, now.

I slept in this morning yet I'm exhausted.  Travel doesn't do well with me.  I was surprisingly less anxious this flight, though.  Repetition is good.

Forgive them anyway.

If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives;
Be kind anyway.

If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies;
Succeed anyway.

If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you;
Be honest and frank anyway.

What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight;
Build anyway.

If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous;
Be happy anyway.

The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow;
Do good anyway.

Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough;
Give the world the best you've got anyway."

Holy jesus.


I think my 10/15 is mostly over.  I should be sleeping.  I'm not.  Tired but too wound up.  Answering clients that need answers before 9 AM when I should be passed out.  I hope I wake them up via their blackberries.  Mmhmm.

After probably about 3 PM tomorrow I get my life back. :-)

Still sick and still trying to get over it... attacking the lungs now 'cause I had to stop it from attacking my nose from a day or two the end of last week.  Someone suggested I take something to stop it attacking my lungs, but I know my luck, if I don't let it do its thing I'll end up with pneumonia or something.  Le sigh."

"event","""Personal Rate of Return from 01/01/2008 to 10/02/2008 is -22.5%"" - so says my 401(k).

My IRA is down 31.4%.  That one's a slightly more risky mix so I'm not surprised...

Only point of this being I'm really, really glad I'm a long, long way from retiring.


Still think it'd be fun to retire at 50, though.  No way I'll have the money to do it, but it's a nice thought.

Gotta go win the lottery.  Mmhmm.

"event","Some people do not have to search -
they find their niche early in life and rest there,
seemingly contented and resigned.
They do not seem to ask much of life,
sometimes they do not seem to take it seriously.
At times I envy them,
but usually I do not understand them -
seldom do they understand me.

I am one of the searchers.
There are, I believe, millions of us.
We are not unhappy, but neither are we really content.
We continue to explore life,
hoping to uncover its ultimate secret.
We continue to explore ourselves,
hoping to understand.

We like to walk along the beach -
we are drawn by the ocean,
taken by its power, its unceasing motion,
its mystery and unspeakable beauty.
We like forests and mountains,
deserts and hidden rivers, and the lonely cities as well.

Our sadness is as much a part of our lives as is our laughter.
To share our sadness with the one we love is perhaps as great a joy as we can know -
unless it is to share our laughter.

We searchers are ambitious only for life itself,
for everything beautiful it can provide.
Most of all we want to love and be loved.
We want to live in a relationship that will not impede
our wandering, nor prevent our search, nor lock us in prison walls.

We do not want to prove ourselves to another or compete for love.
We are wanderers, dreamers and lovers,
lonely souls who dare ask of life everything good and
beautiful.

"event","I don't like it when people say things can't get better.  They can always get better.  Even when I'm not the one with the answers or the ability to change them.  Things can still get better.

The world needs more optimism.

Someone reminded me today that you walk your road in life at your own pace.  Nobody can tell you how quickly to progress, to recover, to move forward, to move on, or if it's ok to back up a little bit or to rest awhile.  Those are all decisions you make independently and you are the only one responsible for moving yourself along your road.  Other people interact with you on that journey, but you're the only one that can put one foot in front of the other, and you're also the only one that knows if your leg is broken or if there're rocks in the road.

The things I need to work on remembering in regards to that, is that there is always going to be movement along that road, and that the road itself doesn't have an end destination.  It goes until it stops and I have no control over where that stopping point is.  So, as far as I need to be concerned at this point, it's an infinite path I travel.  And one that I don't really have the option of stopping on.  Even if I rest awhile, the scenery around me will change, and where I start up again will not be the same place I stopped.  And life is way, way too short to be a passive participant in it."

"event","I wrote a lot of papers about verbal abuse, and abuse in families in general, both in the last couple of years of high school and through english and other classes of varying natures in college.  I also wrote some relatively dark but very thought-provoking poetry that I still think is some of my best emotional expression.  Writing is therapeutic - see the various points that I've actually written more than a few words here in the last however many years this thing has been around, and other journals I've had before it.

I still have some of that writing, but not all of it (and sadly I think I have none of the poetry).  Somewhere I also have a copy of the three page letter I wrote the instigator of such issues in my life, back when he was in no position to really acknowledge it, and I was a little too young to recognize it for exactly what it was.

So for a few years, I did a lot of self-analyzing, thinking, dissecting, disseminating, some spontaneously combusting, and eventually arrived at some kind of conclusion that not fun things happened, but I was better now.  Ready to move onward and do well for myself and generally keep myself up out of the mess I found myself stuck in for awhile.

For the most part I've been successful in that.  Typically I'm also successful in ignoring the little voice in my head that points out that certain resulting issues that I have will never entirely go away.  I know that they won't, but I also know that dwelling on that serves no purpose.  

But it proves to be difficult to bypass, when I get to a point that I can quite clearly see what some of those issues are doing to me in terms of keeping me from things that I want out of life.  And it is an incredibly frustrating related recognition for me that issues as a result of parts of my childhood are going to pop up out of nowhere at various points in my life, just to say hi and generally derail things for a little while.  I don't want that to happen, but it is, as I mentioned, pretty much unavoidable.  I can negate a lot of the impact just by being aware and willing to work to handle it, but still... the existence is.

Sigh.

I think it's just about time to try something new."

"event","Somewhat of a survey question...  when is it ok to lie?  Taking children out of the equation entirely, as I know you sometimes have to fudge the truth with kids.


A related question... is the thought line ""you're only telling half-truths or lying to me now... how do I know where that ends, and can I trust you at all"" wrong?  Is that paranoid or a valid thought?



I get very frustrated very quickly when people aren't totally honest with me.  I almost always take people at exactly what they say unless they're clearly and obviously joking around.  So when someone starts telling little lies for whatever reason, I start thinking the truth is a convenience thing for them and start questioning everything they say.

By the same justification, I can't stand it when people don't listen to what I say... not listen as in necessarily agree with, but listen as in show some respect for an opinion, particularly when that opinion relates to something directly in my control... on a basic level it comes down to stuff like ""when I say no, I mean no, and no means no"" kind of things...

It's two sides of the same coin, words are all we really have between each other, so if I can't take you at yours, and you don't take me at mine, then where are we, really?"

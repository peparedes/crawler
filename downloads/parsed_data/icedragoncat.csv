"event","I think I may delete my name as icedragoncat. It's a childhood name, and I don't want to be connected to all the childish and rotten things I've done in the past. It's kind of why I've avoided this blog. I've abandoned things, people, said some nasty things...

So I want to start over on a fresh, clean plate, and a new name. I think I may start by deleting my communities...it's just not something I want to keep up for all to see. icedragoncat and everything I did under that name is no more. I'm sorry if that some how rubs someone the wrong way, but I just want to completely erase this. 

I'm glad to have met all the wonderful people on here. I'll probably rejoin a select few communities (Zutara? Fuck yeah). If anyone is interested for whatever reason, contact me at jlbarker89@yahoo.com and I'll give you my new username. 

I don't want to rename because my new name will simply replace every single line that displays this username. Can't believe I joined this sire over 5 years ago...wow...and I really only started to join that lovely Zutara community...haha. 

Good bye icedragoncat and all your thousands of comments. It was a good run. :)"

"event","WHAT THE FUCK IS WITH STATISTICS AND ME?!

No matter how many hours I spend studying, this subject still destroys me come test time! I do well on the quizes, averaging an 8.5/10, and do all the homework and get full credit on that, but THE TESTS! I have failed two of them now, with a .56 and .57 respectively. 

TRUFAX: I am not, and will not, EVER, be a math person. Both in middle, and high school, I was mostly an A student, with B's here and there. AND THEN THERE WAS MATH. Always bringing down my GPA like the little motherfucker it is. 

I don't know why it eludes me, leaving me completely baffled. It's so frustrating, I could punch the person in the face who made higher levels required for fields that rarely employ it. 

My main problem, is that we test every other chapter, making two subjects that I have to identify and use the correct formula for. I get confused and wonder which formula is right and then panic! For this last test, I missed two, five point questions (so that's -10 out of 40 right there). One was because I used the wrong formula, and the other I screwed up the calculation (forgot to square some things, ugh!). Then there were points taken off here and there, making me get a total of 23/40. Fucking terrible, but as I glanced around, I saw many tests with many marks, so as a whole, we suck. AWESOME! 

It doesn't help that it takes almost everything in me to stay awake. I wake up at 4:30, go to work, get off at 2-2:30 (depends, really), do some chores, eat, try to relax, then go to class at 6:30, and get out by 9. Focusing is an issue, and tonights class...fuuuuuck. I tried so hard to pay attention to what he was explaining...I'm so confused now with this next chapter. 

Basically this class is eating my soul and I want to kill it with fire."

I just need a break from all the horror flicks I've been watching in light of the Halloween spirit. <i>The Descent</i> 1 and 2 were quite good. Of course it wasn't american either, which is not surprising considering the shit Hollywood has been producing in the horror genre.

$39.95 a month for the past 3 months. My stupid ass should have known not to trust anything 'free' when you type in your card number. They claimed you wouldn't be charged unless you wanted to continue. Of course they didn't tell you it's crucial that you cancel before the 5 days are up.

"event","<lj-cut text=In which I'm asked if I want to move up the ladder at my job"">So, I was again approached with the question of whether or not I'm interested in being a team lead. The store manager's last day was yesterday, and he asked me that a few weeks ago. The new store manager, our awesome team lead, Brian, asked me, and told me I'm his prime choice. 

Basically I work my ass off, do more than what's asked of me, and have proven to be extremely reliable and can take charge when needed. 

He told me a few girls have asked about moving up, but he's had to find a way to kindly tell them no. Bluntly, they suck, are unreliable, and are some of the laziest two-faced bitches I have had to deal with. Actually there are just two, and they both have questioned about advancing. Currently, FAT CHANCE. 

I AM LOOKING A GIFT-HORSE IN THE MOUTH! I didn't TRY for this. Not at all. I've just been doing my job, and evidently extremely well. To me, as your job, you should take pride in it and do your best. It's really not my fault I shine in the mist of incompetence.

The problem is school. While Brian told me out-right he'd be more than willing to work around any schooling I do (I eventually want to transfer, but am just taking things slow), there's still the lingering question of 'Do I really want this?' 

Sure, it's a pay raise, great experience, and the girls will have to actually listen to me when I essentially tell them they fucked up, but it's a lot more work and stress that I would like to do now. I'm 21, and am slowing working my way up to transfer and obtain my degree in Psychology. What I'm going to do with that degree is undecided. Perfect stalling period would perhaps be this team lead position. 

I just don't know. It's a lot more technical work (with paper-work and crap), and I'd have to forfeit my awesome-sauce schedule. Perhaps a little more responsibilty than I want right now. But the plus side of this IS SO DAMN GOOD! But the negatives are certainly there, hence this dilemma. Fuck! SO CONFUSED! 

Or maybe it's just because I've been so irritated and feeling like a train wreck these last few weeks that I just don't feel up to it. There have been so many call-outs (they can't find it within themselves to suck it up?) lately that I've had to stay late and work twice as fast and hard. Today I had to throw 11 pallets <i>entirely by myself.</i> Damn call-out...I'm exhausted, sore, and feel like nobody is trying to make my job easier, when I work so hard to make their job easier. 

The more I do, the less they do, and vice-versa. Kind of shitty how that works out. 

I AM NOT A ROBOT! I have never called-in sick, whether I'm actually sick or in pain. Nelieve me, I'm in pain a lot. I just ignore it, and push through. You gotta do whatcha gotta do. 

I was actually kind of pissed one girl called-in because she was sore. Oh boohoo! Suck it up, and tough it out. This is your JOB, it's WORK, and you have to DO IT. What part of 'This is a very physical and challenging job' did she not understand when we were hired on? 

Again, I'm surrounded by incompetence."

"event","Just came back from <i>Toy Story 3</i>. What a spectacular way to wrap up the movie that launched Pixar and the computer-generated animation era. As the first of its kind, it definitely deserved the closure it was served. 

I genuinely laughed through-out the movie, and the end nearly made me cry. It was bitter-sweet, and I left thinking that there is a need for more movies like this -- like the movies that I grew up on. Not only because they remind me of my childhood, but because of the atmosphere they provide. There is a personal quality about it that is just so emotionally evoking. It's beautiful, and it's a shame that so many movies are destroyed by trying too hard to be either extremely funny, or this mighty epic that has several aspects that are lacking. 

TS3 had a great story, with great dialogue, comedic moments that were fitting, and the animation was superb -- so much smoother than the '95 original. DAMN! It's been 15 years already? I remember this coming out...

<lj-cut text=""Spoiler thoughts"">
The part where Andy was hesistant to give up Woody was SO DAMN TOUCHING! He was going to take him to college after all, but it really expressed how much your childhood memories mean to you. 

Woody and the other toys were a symbol for comfort, hence wanting to take Woody -- the epitome of Andy's childhood and the good ol' times -- with him to a place that was sure to be challenging, stressful, and in some moments frightening. The fact that he let them go exhibited his 'coming of age', and it really developed his character without needing to give him a lot of screen-time. 

The One Last Play was sweet. Who says teenagers still can't act like little kids? Again, nostalgia is a powerful thing. The best thing you can give to someone is a gift that means something to you. Given how attached Andy was to the toys that brought him so much joy as a child, it was truly a special moment for that shy girl. Sure, they're just toys, but they carry a sentimental value that is worth more than the plastic they're made of.  

Also, I loved how the aliens saved them with THE CLAAAWWWW. I have to admit, at that moment, I was like: OH-NOOO! HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET OUT? THEY DO, I KNOW IT, BUT HOW THE HE- OMG THE CLLLAAAAAAWWWWW!</lj-cut>

All-in-all, it's a must see, especially for those who remember when the first one came out and all those emotions associated with it. Just another reason why I will always love Disney, regardless how many flops they create."

No. They shipped it in a little bubble-wrapped plastic bag. The wheel has a giant dent in it, and so it's utterly useless! I tried calling the supplier, but nobody answered. I left them an e-mail instead, but, argh! I just know it's going to take awhile for this, and I would like that as soon as possible. Of course it's a model that isn't carried in stores, otherwise I would have got it either at Petco or PetSmart.

Seriously, what nimrod ships a fragile object in something other than a box? My filters, which are a little less fragile, came in a box. 

The worst part is I have a feeling I'm going to have to pay to return it, which I will argue because as far as I'm concerned, it belongs in the garbage, and it's their fault for not shipping it in an appropriate packaging. A BOX! <b>BOX!</b>

Meet Jinx, our 2 month old kitten we got Wednesday. My cat (shown) has taken to him rather well. I'm inclined to think it's because she's 9, fat and happy, and could really give two shits about the entire ordeal. She knows she's number 1. XD

Our other cat however, has completely closed up. She won't stop hissing/ growling at him, and is always hiding from the rest of us. She's even hissing at the other animals, including my cat, who she's always been incredibly close with (see icon). Hopefully within a week or two she'll calm down. I've been giving her as much attention as possible, so her jealousy/ insecurity doesn't last...poor cat. 

Our dogs...are okay? Our big one is actually afraid of the kitten, as he hissed and growled when he first met them, but she's trying to get closer. Our chihuahua has been persistent in getting closer to him, and has managed to lick his ears and get close. I think after the kitten has fully accepted the dogs they'll get along great. 

Our calico's reaction obviously has me bothered, but, I hope she'll come around soon enough. I was certain, given her usually calm and docile behavior she'd warm up to the kitten much faster than my cat -- how wrong I was! 

P.S. I lost a fish today. Perhaps my new florescent light set-up stressed him out too much? Damn."

"event","1. There's a movie trailer flying around the internet lately, and when I first read the title, <i>The Human Centipede</i>, I instantly thought the infamous FAKE AND GAY term that can be found everywhere on YouTube. 

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yISIXp-FK-Y"">IT IS A REAL MOVIE.</a> Don't watch if you can't stomach the thought of the clashing and the joining of orifices. Just think, if they have to shit...I wouldn't even consider <i>not</i> killing myself. 

2. About yesterdays drama llama at work: a part of me feels guilty, but I could have told Boss way more. I kept it brief, and only really talked to him because the team leads urged me to discuss it with him. Outcome? Well, he told me to please not change a thing about how I work, and that he'd talk to her. Actually, he used the word 'rip' and so...yeah... Then, what are the odds I ended up driving behind, then beside her, on my way home? I'm pretty sure she noticed me: pretty much one-of-a-kind in town with my car and the giant dragon stickers on the sides.

3. My fast-track class is tragically full of reading. Like, why are the chapters so long? And Redundant? I'm skimming a lot of it though. This is what, my fourth Psychology class? Well, my fifth counting high-school, so I've pretty much got the basics. Correlation is not causation. Yes.

4. <a href=""http://buzz.yahoo.com/buzzlog/93573?fp=1"">I KNEW IT!</a> Haiti had a big one, Chile had an even bigger one, then Mexico, now China? Oh, can't forget the minor one in LA recently, too. I just knew something was up with the earth. It's on a earth-shaking frenzy. 

Rats. This 2012 hysteria is not going to cease until 2013. ""We made it! It was a lie!"""

Rented it. Beat it in 10 hours. 

The story line was unique, the game-play was exhilerating, graphics are top notch (water and shadows are great) and it had a creepy factor that wasn't really scray per say, more so kind of disturbing. <b>AND IT'S NOT EASY.</b> You don't have an inventory, your life drains really fast, and your ammo has a tendency to just about completely drain in a big battle. In fact I spent half the game saying 'OH SHIT I'M ALMOST OUT OF AMMO!' and often did end up with half my weapons exhausted. Searching thoroughly for money, and hacking health and vending machines are key. You'll run dry real quick. 

I of course went the evil route and harvested all the Little Sisters (ripped little girls hearts out), and up-graded the shit out of myself. Big Sisters are a BITCH. 

Highly recommend Bioshock 2."

"event","So, the finale of <i>Skins</i> was, well, dammit! PREDICTABLE!

<lj-cut text=""Get it into your head, I&#39;m Cook"">

The pacing threw me off a bit, and kind of made the finale stale up until the last minute. I know the whole series is only 8 episodes, but, the pacing this last episode was like this: THERE'S SO MUCH SHIT TO COVER AND TIE-UP BUT HOW ABOUT WE GET SOME SNAZZY FILLER SHOTS IN! :D

Pandora X Thomas and Emily X Naomi. Meh. So they found happiness. That was...kind of cheesy, but I'm glad there was a light side to this. 

Finding it twisted, in a tragic ironic sense, that they ended partying and coming to a resolution of sorts in Freddie's shed. I mean, they're assuming he ran off because he's over-whelmed at the moment, when in reality he's dead. That's just...DX

The ending scene? I figured that it would be Cook to confront that fucker Foster. After all, they didn't spend most of this series reinforcing their friendship and love for nothing. Cook IS one tough cookie -- he said it all with his last few words on screen. He has little to lose at this point for unleashing his fury upon Foster. We can all assume that Cook over-powered Foster, and really did kill him (or maybe just about). In fact, I think Foster himself knew what was coming to him. Nervous face much when Cook was acting all calm? YES. 

I was shocked at how bloody Freddie's clothes were. I mean, he got smacked around with a blunt object, and in the last episode I had figured the blood splatter scene was from a hit to the face. HIS SHIRT WAS FUCKING SOAKED! His shoe had a generous amount on it too! Poor kid. 

I do wonder what Foster did with the body. Why'd he strip him? If you were going to just dump the body you could leave his clothes on. If you had plans to make moving it more...managable and...inconspicuous...then OH SHIT! 

All-in-all, Series 2 is still on top, followed by the first one. The second generation couldn't quite reach the bar set by the fist one. Hopefully the next generation will be less predictable, more interesting, and have a totally new plot/ theme to follow. 

No lie though, it did it's job and entertained me for eight hours."

A major spoiler, EVERYWHERE, that's going to keep me up half the night guessing. No one has uploaded it yet, that I can see, and I'm with-holding from watching the promo for next week.

I've been going over my information, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to bullshit 2 minutes worth of this material. I'm going to expand as I think of ways to makes this a little longer. Ugh. Freaking metaphorical theology. Hate you. 

2. Have you guys seen <lj user=teachelite>? I don't know what to really think of it. On one hand, I think it's cool there's a critique community up aimed at giving beginner icon makers some pointers, but the other part of me says there are way too many restrictions, rules, and LABELING to make the community remotely enjoyable. These communities should be more laid back -- after all we're all going to have differing opinions on what is good, and there shouldn't be 'teachers' categorized by their skill. Chances are, I may think an 'advanced' icon maker isn't quite as good as that 'intermediate' one. It's really being controlled all by the mods, who are labeling the teachers with their own bias opinions. These opinions will be put forth and labeled, then stamped to everyone's subconscious about how good that teacher really is. Ultimate fail in the end? Who knows. 

Just seems like there are too many hoops to jump through to even get started there -- and I don't particularly care for the skill level categories. I didn't realize we had to have people approve of our icons for us to simply say <i>Perhaps adjusting the sharpening variables would immensely improve your icons</i> or <i>using the same PSD on every icon does not work; try playing around with the coloring without PSDs and see what you can make of the in-program tools</i>. Not elaborate at all.

Then we hit up Trader Joe's, Costco, and had a delicious lunch at Red Lobster. I got away with only spending $100, and that's awesome considering Costco is such a hard place to only spend $50 at. All those $10 items add up quick...and why the fuck is ass wipe $20? Seriously?! Oh, because it's a necessity and people will buy it? Bastards. 

2. <i>Skins</i>. Okay, so Series 4 certainly had a dramatic beginning. O.o

Makes me wonder if it's foreshadowing the tone this series will cast. I have yet to watch Series 1 in its entirety, but it wasn't as dark as Series 2. I wonder, since there's a new generation, if the same thing is going to happen. I've watched up to the 3rd episode, which is up to date, and it seems like a pretty accurate assumption. However, another Chris scenario? DO NOT WANT. 

And. Episode 3 had some disturbing tid bits in it. If you've watched, you know what I'm talking about. THAT'S JUST WRONG!

Hopefully tonight he mentions the presentations again -- my friend and I really want to get that shit done and over with. Fuck oral presentations! 

2. A little bit of drama llama at work. I met our 'new' team lead, and I can see why people get the impression she's a bitch, because her laugh is soooo fake. Like what I said seriously wasn't funny, and there's no need to bark out questions like I'm deaf. :/ 

Second! Some lady brought her grand daughter in, and the little girl kept grabbing samples apparently. Okay, they're taste <i>samples</i>, and the Kitchen Table is not a buffet. The K/T lady told the little gitl she couldn't have anymore (after several trips), and the grand mother FLIPPED HER SHIT! :O 

I was near my manager, whom she approached, and fuck! She was raging about how her grand daughter was crying and upset (looked fine to me!) and how it's 'bullshit that lady was so mean!' Honestly? She can't essentially have the word 'NO' said to her grand child? Spoiled much? 

Best part: as she was walking out the door 'Give her a dollar more an hour and maybe she'll be nicer.' Whaaaaat? LOL. Bitch. Everyone talked to the K/T lady afterwards, and it seemed reasonable to me. Little kids can't be eating all the damn samples! Buy it. 

3. What the hell am I doing? Last night I started re-watching Avatar: The Last Airbender again. Yes. All the way back to book 1. I haven't watched book 1 in forever. Damn, they sure came a long way with <s>how much money they had</s> animation.

Well, <i>Assassin's</i> is pretty close, but doesn't have nearly the re-play value. 

2. I started watching the Super Bowl, but I don't like FB so stopped, but I managed to catch one of <i>The Last Airbender</i> trailers. I must say, the graphics are coming along splendidly for something, well, based off a Nickelodeon show. Okay, I know I said I wasn't going to watch this movie when it comes out because of the fail of the ending the series had, but I'm thinking we shouldn't judge it too much. It may be a stand alone that may end up being quite exceptional. 

3. I didn't do anything, not even my hair today, and by golly, that felt refreshing. We ate beef fajitas and generally had a Mexican feast for our Super Bowl meal, as opposed to eating burgers like the white people we are. Totally satisfying.

Essentially we have a game of the week (or make it bi-weekly, whatever happens), we rent it, and write up a feedback on the gaming experience.

Then my manager called me today asking that I please come in tomorrow morning to help catch up on the load. Evidently I have the inability to say ""NO"". Meh, more money? <s>Workoholic here.</s>"

<lj-cut text=""Rage and complaining here"">
First, I work in a grocery store. With food. Food expires. Therefore the shit needs to be rotated with the later date pushed to the back. If there's multiple facings, then it's a damn good idea to spread the dates as evenly as possible across. Feb. 9th should not be one row going straight back with and Feb. 25th right next to it in front. On a milk product no less.

Fucking lazy moron!

Eggs have been pissing me off lately too. Everytime I stock them, which is everyday I work, I have to fix the rotation. Somebody at night is rumbling them completely wrong! Jan. 13th should not be behind Jan. 20th! NO! Kick them to the side so they're not popping out of the box they come in, and push the new product to the back. On eggs, this means taking out most of the eggs that are already there and putting the new ones in. Time consuming, but it's correct. 

Rumbling in general pisses me off too! When I'm stocking cans, there shouldn't be two half empty boxes on the shelf. Our shelves go really deep, and we leave the product in it's little tray box to make rotation easy. It is prefered that at night most of these boxes go away, especially if it's half empty. We sell food, not boxes. 

I think the thing that bothers me most is that older lady team lead. She makes comments she really doesn't need to make. I get she's trying to joke, or maybe be light-hearted but sometimes it's hard to take it that way because the joke feeling isn't there. It's offensive. Bottom line. Everybody has complained about her at some point or another. Some even call her a crazy bitch. I'm inclined to agree with that sometimes. To boot, she doesn't really help with the load. The opener should help us do the load in the morning! GAH!</lj-cut>

2. A happier note. Maybe. The mall is losing one of the book stores and everything is 50% off. I checked it out, and there were a few books I almost bought, but decided against it. I did drop by Bath & Body Works and got more of my spray. I bought my mom hers too since there was a buy 2 get one free sale. I couldn't pass that up. YES. That is my girly love store. It smells pretty. 

3. <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/wd_lims/130709.html?#cutid1"">This challenge</a> reminds me of my grad trip to Disney Land. There was a duck walking around and people were giving him sweets. We also went on all the kiddie rides since you could ride those 3 times in the time it took to wait out the line for the bigger rides. Haha. I don't even know.

My brother's 'new' 2001 Honda S2000. It's not a truck, which I would have prefered him to get since he used his truck as one, but he wanted a little sports car. The best part of the deal is that the money the insurance will give him for his truck will completely pay this off. 

Furthermore, for an '01, this car only has 19,000 miles on it and is in emaculate condition. The dealership let it go for $12,000, which is pretty damn awesome considering it's worth way more. Well, why so little you might ask? The dealership it was sitting at was a Mercedes-Benz lot that owned a series of dealerships consisting of BMW, Lexus, Infiniti and so on. When there's a used car with a price tag of $239,000, I think the S2000 was pretty much a waste of space to them. I mean, apparently they forgot they even had this car. Basically they didn't care if they let it go for nothing because they have their expensive (the cheapest new car there was 42K) to focus on. My brother lucked the fuck out. 

As a side note, my car is super clean and shiny. It's hard to see in that picture, but I managed to con my mom into helping me wash and wax it. I WILL NEVER OWN A BLACK VEHICLE AGAIN! It's only pretty when clean. Seriously. 

2. Work is killing me. I hurt everywhere. DX

Well, fuck. Hope anyone isn't driving any of the cars shown there. DEATH! Especially the number one car. NO CHANCE!

There were no gifts this year or big celebration for my family, but I hope yours involved family time and friends. 

My friend and I went to our other friend's house and we made cookies. They basically fail at cooking and I had to remind them that eggs are an important ingredient to remember. XD Oh, and we burnt the second batch because we went to her room to music browse when suddenly we remembered we were baking cookies! It was all good though. 

I was supposed to have tomorrow off, but my manager called me last night asking if I could work 8-2:30. Of course I said yes so, yeah. Today was my only day off. Oh well, more money for me."

"event","So filled with disappointment today. I feel like I let my manager down. He gave me a Christmas card saying how I'm one of his best/ valuable employees and that I 'kick ass' and such at load. Hell, I'm the main load person as I do it every day now. Essentially he has high expectations of me and I feel obligated to push out the load at record speed.  

However, today I felt extremely sluggish during my 5:30 to 12 shift. The fresh load wasn't that bad (however there was a pallet that was mixed and just straight up stupidly put together), and we didn't make the time I had aimed for. The ambient still wasn't done when I left -- a pallet and a half remained out of 3 and a half. Although it's worth mentioning they were huge pallets packed with a lot of tiny items (cans, boxes of bottles -- sauces and other crap like that). 

I don't know if it's my exhaustion, my pains, or both that affected my speed. :/ 

Yesterday I dropped a heavy can of soup on my big toe, and it was hurting all day today. My right hand hurts when it's open and there's pressure on it, and to top it off I ran my left heel over with a bin. 

What I need to do is buy nice gloves and safety shoes to prevent accidents and painful reminders. Seriously. I don't know how I've lasted this long. I'm beat."

"event","1. Monday through Thursday I'm working load at 5:30AM to 12. Pretty damn sweet if I do say so myself. We can move a lot faster without customers, therefore today we were done with fresh by 7:30, and we finished off the ambient pallets by 11. Hell yes. 

I recieved a fat bonus check from work too. Basically work has just been awesome for me. I'll probably completely crash after the pot luck tonight at 6. :/ 

2. <I>Assassins Creed 2</i> turned out to be mildly disappointing. After I turned it back to the rental joint, I actually bought it ( with bonus check and extra hours and all), and I ended up beating it last night. I was thinking it was...longer...more substance...and fuck that story line that leaves you hanging! Meh, I'll go back and do stuff I skipped over, then re-play the whole thing again just because.

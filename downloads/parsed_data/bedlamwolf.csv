"event","so I know this is going to seem like a No big deal, Em is overreacting again thing....
some you already know this, my grandma (nana) is stealing my room. Once again, Nana gets her way. she get my room, my tv....my freshly redecorated to my style room. AND now that I'm not home, shes not eating again and has gone back to treating my mother like crap, telling her shes a horrible person, can't do anything right yadda yadda yadda. Nana shit.

I do love Nana, shes family. But she's 84. shes an adult and needs to start acting like one insead of a spoiled five year old. We had a screaming match over the summer actually about that. I won. seems she forgot....though she threatened to kick us (mom me and the animals) out of the house.

yeah. summer was just so.....whats the word I'm looking for? oh yes.... FUN (sarcasim).

*great-aunt (nana's sis) died
*wart (ewwww) removed
*wedding (I did not need ANY of the stress associated with a family gathering soon after a death, thank you. and the dress was scary for me.)
*wisdom teeth removed
*dry socket from wisdom teeth
*work 9 days strait 8 hour shifts 3 alone (then a day off, then repeat)
*Esin-bar
*My friends ditched me at Otakon
*taking care of Nana
*Cleaning the house (and getting shit from Nana about it and from my aunt and uncle thanks soooo much I was fucking sick!)
*No communication with my best friend (who forgot when I left for school)
*losing my room to my grandma

this does not enclude starting school, looking for a job for afterschool, trying to find time t
o drive, and an upsetting doctor visit, or my dad thinking I just turned 20 (22 people, 22.) that's just normal crap.

This year has basically sucked ass for me. so I'm sorry if I'm annoying, anti-social, or angst-y. I feel miserable. It will pass....in about a week, so long as nothing ELSE goes wrong in my family. So yeah. it might not seem big to you, none of it probably does. But it all happened in less then half a year to me. I can not handle anything else at this point."

"event","so the con was a week ago.
I had a blast. went in costume 2 out of 3 days, one was an OC, all lime grean, even a wig. the foxtail was not green though. Lots of people took my pic in that. I'll see if I can find it and post.
I also went as Sexy-no-jitsu. That went well. again, a good number of pics.

Saw a few peveiws of new shows, found out that Witchblade is liceniced, and is actally slated for early '08, or maybe this fall (hopeing for fall) wallflower is also licenced. got to see it, was awsome. so was witchblade.

Went to a few panels, did a fan-panle mock trial one where we put anime charactors on trial. Rainbow bright will be highering illegal immigrants to work for her instead of sprite-slave labor, the villin in FF 3 I think it was is cleared of all charged, and Sasuke is to be castrated.

did not go to the rave. mostly chilled in the halls, watching people. got a kimono (no Obi, have to get that) tab socks, a weaponfan, a hat (gaia ORY hat) little gaia dragon, a free poster, gaia stuff for the site, a lemming for mom, KKM the new volume, and a teapot. Oh, and some new patches.

Had a blast. Have pics, will upload later.

Last day at dales this tuesday!"

"event","yay going to Otakon this year, going to be crazy poor after. Working too much, pulling shifts alone on register, might be working at Lows if my friend comes through for me. Wish me luck...if not, at the end of this week, I'm turning in my 2 weeks unless they give me a raise. It's fucking crazy to pull a 8 hour shift go in early, work with only 5 people (4 called out..4!) stay a half an hour late, only get at 15 min, and do it all for 8 crappy bucks an hour. I'm done, I still never found a sutable shirt for the uniform anyway. I'd quit now, but I need the cash.

It's hot here, and I'm feeling crafty. going to have to save like crazy after the con....I really am excited, but I know I'm going to be broke....I'm having pre-buy guilt, lol.

Had habatchi with Mom and Nana today, it was great! Finally got some art markers and new books too, so I am very happy. Pics from my coz's wedding comeing soon, we ordered them, and I'll facebook 'um when they come.

thought of the day:
Why the hell do I have CAVE crickets in my basement? I don't live anywhere near a cave.

Ok, Fantastic 4 2 was good. went with a friend. Had fun. 4 people called out of work yesterday. Sucks. Went back to the mouth people, turned out it was dry socket causing the pain. they stuffed them with Cloves or some shuch foul tasting shit. ICK!

"event","So, I went to work yesterday, made it to the last hour, started to cry because the pain-killers just stopped working. I was fine after a minute, we just had been crazy full, and I was supposed to be the only one on register. 2 people stayed to help, which was sweet of them. So we were packed! After I cried a bit (no customers were around, it was the first lull all day, damnit and it was 8!) I was fine to work, but they sent me home, lol. I took a full pain-pill, and ended up stoned out of my gourd.

Went today, worked a full shift, mostly alone, 'cause I was the only one on for register. Sold out of 5 different lotteries, All the bagels, hardrolls and pasteries, most of the papers, and all of the propaine tanks. Again, crazy-packed all night. I felt better though. my mouth mostly is just sore, but the bottom left is really bad still. kinda like throb-pain!-throb-BLOOD!-throb-PAIN! so I'm going to call and see if it's dry-socket or a pulled stitch or something, cause I'm getting pissed with my mouth. I want brownies damnit!

On an happy note, I'm starting to look at graduation -bribes/presents. Mostly because If I don't look now, I know I'm going to slack off really bad. So I'm bribing myself. I was thinking birds for a while, like finches or maybe a Mayh, but I got a better idea today! Main Coon cat. They're really cool, and I still really really miss my cat, Midnight, but I miss having a cat around too. So if you know any info on them, let me know, ok?

I'll post on tuesday at the latest; work tommorow, possible Fantastic 4 2 after work, and Nana's got cateract surgery tues, so I'm off (then I'm on shift all week through sunday, a few days alone....I hate dales.)"

Ok so I misspelled the word, but you know what I mean. Makeup to cover up freakles and fine lines, come on freakles are just there....it bugs me a bit that people just can't be happy with themselves on a day to day basis. This goes for those damn stupid diet commertials, too. Watch the peoples shoulders and posture durring them, maybe you'll see what I see. I'm just sick of people telling me if I'm not perfict to do something about it, go on a diet, wear foundation, eat pickles, whatever."

My bird died. Mel was old, and he died while we were away. that really sucked. I miss him. Mom freaked out, because he used to be so nosiy, and then suddenly the house was silent. It was kinda scary. So While I was at the Asian food market (AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) she got two black masked lovebirds: Lois and Clark. I picked the name.
The asian food market was cool. spent way to much money. I recognized the songs on the radio, even though they were in Japanese. Even had Raman from a Raman stand! It was fun
Newyears was cool. Wyno and I have made nice. So that was coo. We smashed produce, and broke and ore doing it, made lots of noise and watched speed grapher. (Oh yay? i didn't really like it) They guys were like Locus, they descended upon the house, and ate everything, then took off. There was only ME and spicy's new GF for the girls the whole night (beck and liam don't count, haha) Barb had work, so couldn't stay, and Katie was sick. In the end, I went to bed aT 7ish, and woke up surrounded by the guys crashed out on the floor.
Saw eragon: hated it. not a good stand alone movie, and let a lot out of the book if you take if for a book-to-movie.
Saw Night at the Museum: Loved it. grows on you, very funny.
Saw Happily N'ever after: Good. Made me laugh, would have liked to go with a girl and not just the guys.

Met a guy at walmart. he seemed nice, we're talking on myspace.....and that was my break."

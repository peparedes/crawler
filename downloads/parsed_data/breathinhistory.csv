"event","I had one of the most stressful weeks that I have ever had at UCLA.  I am taking a chem lab course and that required about 14 hours of in-lab/lecture time last week.  Hopefully next week will be different.  I am also still required to work in my research lab 15 hrs/week (I had a meeting with my mentor on Monday and he was being really strict about the hours).  On top of that, my sorority was rushing, which required 12 hrs this week.  I have just been going nuts.  I have a midterm on Monday, which I of course haven't started studying for and I missed lecture twice this week.  Luckily my discussion section rocked the house.  Oh, I also had to drop my favorite class, Geography 3: Cultural Geography.  I REALLY liked this class but I couldn't attend 2 straight hours of discussion, I needed to spread it over 2 days, and the professor wouldn't let me.  Jerk.  The thing is, if I did drop a class, I would drop one that required a lot of work, like my physical biochemistry class.  But no, couldn't do that.  Ugh, I think I will still take the class next year though.
Another big thing....
There is a concert in San Diego that I am going to with Brent today and tomorrow.  I wanted to drive to my house on Friday (last night) so that we didn't have to drive so far in one shot.  Brent had agreed to this all week, and at 1030pm last night, decided he didn't want to go.  I was beat tired from being at a sorority event for 5 hrs, awake at 7am to mail my fucking taxes, and class and lab all day, and he was bouncing off the walls and being a prick.  He was like ""you drive down tonight and I will meet you there tomorrow"".  I was way too tired (obviously) to drive myself down there, so right now I am in my apartment about to study and doing laundry waiting for him to pick me up at 10am.  Doesn't this sound like so much fun?!!
My whole relationship with Brent is hard to explain to people.  Neither of us want an emotional committment or romance.  So we are basically like really really good friends that have sex.  Haha.  The reason why I like this is because I got so hurt the last time I was in an emotionally committed relationship and I don't want to set myself up for that again.  Also, if I am romantic, and if that leads to love, then I start considering the person in all of my plans and I don't want to do that either.  He and I are just filling void space until we are ready for an emotional committment.  Once I am, I think it will be really easy to get out of the relationship with Brent, and most likely still be friends, since that is basically what we are.  I don't plan to ""stay"" with Brent over the summer if we are not in the same city, because there is no sense of committment and that would be so lame.  It might be a great time for me to be single, or to have hookups, or to find someone serious (haha, I really don't think I will be ready that soon....I'm talking years here!).
Speaking of summer, I will most likely have an interview next week for Schering-Plough, a pharmaceutical company.  I will either work in Palo Alto, Ca or Kenilworth, NJ (very near to Manhattan and a couple of my friends will be there).
So that is the scoop for now...
I have a problem set due Monday, a midterm in genetics, and a pre-lab and quiz on Tuesday for Chem Lab.  I also have a 20 pg report that I was supposed to have 5 pgs by now and don't.  I need all these calculations from my experiments to do that, and yeah, I haven't done them.  I haven't even been collecting all of the data that I need to calculate.  I'm not getting an A in this class...."

"event","""why dont you have some dirty hot sex with me?"" -pepper
that is the coolest song!  im so mad that i didnt bring my laptop home so that i could buy it on itunes and have it to listen to all day!
anyway, finals are over but i dont feel like they are.  i am still nervous and stressed out.  i went to the dentist yesterday, and i have 4 cavities and need my wisdom teeth pulled.  i felt a sense of failure i guess because i have never had a cavity before, and the dentist's assistant said that i need to take better care of myself, implying that i dont take care of myself?  ugh, so i was pissed for a while, especially because my teeth hurt like hell.  the other thing is, my mom doesnt have dental insurance, so we are paying for all of this ourself.  yesterday was $200, and the fillings will be $600.  it sucks.  who knows how much the surgery will be.  im so scared to go under anesthesia.  i never knew i was scared until i was told that i have to.
today im going to clean out my car, and get it washed!!!  finally.  im going to have a voice lesson, which i cant really afford, and then i will be heading back to school.  i might be meeting up with a friend that i met through andrew last year.  she is going to hong kong tomorrow!  once i get to school ill be cleaning up a bit and then going to brent's.  actually, i think he may be coming to my place....not sure.  but we are going to one of his friend's parties tonight.  should be interesting.
speaking of andrew, he called last night.  it was the first time that we had talked on the phone since late october.  i had called him about a month ago, so really he is calling me back...he is quick!  we talked online once and i really had nothing to say to him.  i didnt know which of the events in the last 5 months that i was going to talk to him about.  but he is a talker.  it was weird because our conversation was just like how our first conversations were in august before we really even became a couple.  we talked for about an hour and a half.  i mentioned that i was dating someone and he asked about him.  i really didnt know what to say.  i told him that brent was an entrepeneur that owned 3 companies and that his dad founded atari and chuck e. cheese.  brent is kind of a weird guy to describe when you know the person asking really doesnt want to know about him.  i asked if he was dating anyone and he said no.  im sure he is hooking up like crazy though.  whatever.  im am so indifferent to what he does.  i care about his well being, but not really about us being back together or anything.  it was really nice to talk to him though, even though it was awkward.
so what are you all doing for spring break?  im not so sure what i am doing.  my parents are broke, which means that the golf trip my dad and i were planning got cancelled.  ill be at school some of the time because brent is up there and i have to make a poster presentation for my research.  next monday i am presenting at a professional conference in san diego.  brent and i are going to go down early monday and go to the wild animal park in san diego.  ive been once before, but im really excited to go back.  so thats what i will be doing for break, working!  what really sucks is becuase brent is not the traditional student, he is working all of spring break, which makes him so boring and not someone to play with and go do stuff.  hamadi and derek will be around, so they will be some people to do things with, but AHHH!"

"event","in 2 1/2 hours i will start my second final, chemical thermodynamics.  i was really excited to take this class in the beginning of the quarter, but now that it is nearly over, i am not excited at all.  i didnt really learn anything in this class.  i can't study for the final because everything seems so boring, like all i have to do is calculate stuff and i will be fine.  there will be a couple derivation problems, which i have somewhat prepared for, but i am just so bored.  and last night i freaked out thinking that i didnt know enough for the test, so i woke up at 530, reset my alarm for 600am, got up for an hour, went back to sleep until 830am, ate a second breakfast, and now im just sitting here wishing i would have just slept until 9am then did a little last minute preparation.  im kind of worried i will walk into the test and not be able to do a lot of the problems, but then again im not because all the equations are given, and every part of the test is pretty much plug and chug.  well, in 5 hours, it will be over, and my life will be much better, i will GET to study for physics WOOPEE!!!"

"event","i just took a nap and during it woke up with the most disgusted feeling inside.  i have no idea why, but here are the events leading up to my nap:

yesterday brent came over with lunch around 140pm, then left at 2pm to go take a final.  my friend came over to study and brent came back around 545pm.  he was acting kinda feely, like putting his arm around me and rubbing my back, so my friend left and liz (my roommate) left the kitchen saying ""ill leave you two lovebirds"".  he went home to rest after his test and have alone time and i studied physics, picked up some study material from a friend, and got to his house close to 930pm.  we went inside his house to get food and ended up having a meal with his parents, which is always entertaining because his dad is so funny.  anyway we went back to his room and started watching a movie.  during the movie i noticed a pair of boxers in his bed that i didnt remember taking off of him, and i felt weird.  i mentioned something about it to him, and he was like ""you took those off of me"" but i swear i dont remember.  i feel like maybe i was being silly because we had only been apart one night, but i still felt awkward.  he said he wasnt lying to me. i got over it and then we had the weakest sex ever.  it lasted like 4 minutes, and he didnt have his normal orgasm reaction, it was so weird.  i really didnt want to stay the night because i dont sleep well there, but i did anyway.  i woke up at 730am and got ready to leave.  somehow we started talking, had sex, talked more, and i didnt leave until 1030.  im not sure if it was something we talked about that makes me feel weird now, if it has nothing to do with him, or what.  we did talk about his ex-girlfiend a bit, because i am curious about it and i want to learn as much from him so maybe i can handle a similar situation if i ever have to.  

anyway, i feel a little bit better now after jotting it down.  i think im being lame, and kind of feeling uncomfortable because i wont see him until wednesday, and i wonder if he will even try and contact me between now and then.  but, im going to head to the library and study physics some.  then cram for my religion exam tomorrow, and do a little bit of chemistry.  i cant wait for this quarter to be over."

"event","so i decided to take action on plan 1, which was to call brent sunday night.  all that i wanted to say was ""can i come over"".  when he answered (finally after i had called about 6 times or so...he doesnt have caller id on his house phone) he responded exactly the way i hoped he would with ""hey girl"".  he talked about his weekend in norcal and then i just asked if i could come over and he said ""yeah"" kind of surprised, but as if it were no big deal.  i said ""really?"" and he said ""yeah"".  so, i came over.  once i got there we just talked as if nothing had happened, because i dont really want to talk about the situation anymore.  of course, we had sex, which was really short because we hadnt had sex in 4 days, so it didnt take long for him :(.  since then, i have stayed over every night.  i should tell you why i changed my mind, why i wanted to see him again.  the reason is because i dont want to marry this guy, and he doesnt want to even be monogomous with me let alone marry me, so i figure that he is just here to fill a void.  the gap that comes between now and when i do meet the guy that i am supposed to marry, sometime in 6 years or so.  i dont want to get married until i haved lived a fullfilling single life.  or life without being married that is.  granted what im doing now doesnt make me that single, but still, i know this is a temporary thing.  so now when he acts like im his girlfriend, i just say in my head ""im filling a void"".  and that works for me.  meanwhile, he is talking about a camping trip with us, his brother and his brother's girlfriend, and his other friend carlos and carlos' girlfriend.  hmmm.  i wonder what he refers to me as to other people.  because i always just say the guy im dating, but do you think he says ""the girl im dating?""  kind of weird.  last night when i came over he had a friend staying over and he told me that he had told his friend i was coming over.  so what does he say, ""this girl is coming over?""  ""my friend is coming over?""  hmm.  i dont really care.  when something happens, i just kind of ignore it.  i feel like if he wants to see other girls, he will stop seeing me.  and ill check up on that every 2 weeks.  haha.  the best part about not being in a relationship is not having to have converstaions that involve jealousy or feelings very often.  i try to limit my outbursts to every two weeks.

concerning school: i have 3 classes.  
history of religion: i have an A so far, but there is a lot of preparing to do for the final in order to keep my A.  ill probably start tomorrow and do a little each day. final: monday
chemistry: i have an A so far, but the final is killer, so i really have to study for that, final is tuesday.
physics: i have a B right now.  i really thought that i was failing becuase i did very poorly on the first midterm.  i studied my ass off and just wanted to get higher than the average on the second midterm, which thankfully i did.  so now its all about the final.  im hoping to get a B or a B+.  NO B-'s!!!!

right now i am at brents house.  he left for a 9am meeting in malibu and im just going to relax here and do my physics problem set that is due today at 3pm.

what is everyone doing over spring break?  ill be gone until easter (the first sunday of break) but then ill be around campus doing work in my lab.

see you all soon!"

"event","there are so many things that i need to say, im not sure it is possible to type that much.
basically i am confused by our relationship because brent acts like we are serious and over a month ago when i asked if he was seeing other girls he said ""no-ish"".  he said he was seeing other girls, but after he and i started hanging out he stopped returning their calls.  then he brought up the fact that he asked me to go to a comedy show 2 weeks in advance and i said ""what does that mean"" and he said ""isnt it obvious?"" i said ""no"" he said, ""well, if i was dating, i would wait until closer to the day to ask someone to go with me, but i already know that i want to take you.""  so then 2 weeks after we went to the show, i brought up ""what are we doing"" because he invited me to have dinner with his parents, and was spilling his heart out to me about emotional issues he was having with his parents, and we were seeing each other a lot, but he still wanted to ""be able to take a girl on a date"".  and i just couldnt understand why he wanted to act serious but be open.  my heart and mind cannot understand that, and i knew i was setting myself up to get hurt.  so i brought it up to him again, after 2 weeks.  and he was still wanting to keep the openness.  i realize now that i did not make a good point of WHY i was uncomfortable, like i am doing for you now, when i brought this up to him on wednesday.  i said to him, i cant do this anymore, im serious.  he shrugged his shoulders and dropped his head, and came over to me and said lets think about it.  i said ""do you honestly think that if you think about it you will change your mind?"" he said ""no"".  he stepped back and was contemplating something.  unfortunately, jasmin came home right at that moment.  then he said ""i dont have time for a girlfriend, this is a mistake"" and walked away without looking at me or saying goodbye.  i havent heard from him since then.  
but now i am really thinking that the cause of my confusion is because he is confused.  he is still hurt from his last relationship.  he was, in his words, ""madly in love with her and she broke my heart into a million pieces"".  she was sleeping with someone else for 2 months without telling brent, after 3 years of them being together.  she has come up in way too many of our conversations for him to be over her.  now i just dont know how to approach him with this.  he is an AMAZING guy, and it kills me that some girl ruined his desire to be amazing to someone else.  so now i am wondering what to say when i see him again.  he is norcal right now, and will be back sunday.  i am thinking of three different plans: 1) call sunday and ask if i can come over.  ill call late enough (1130pm-ish) so he has had time to get some stuff done after his weekend away.  i have stuff at his place that i need to pick up if we arent going to see each other again anyway, but the reason is really to talk to him.  2) make the same call same time monday night so he has had more time to readjust to being back. 3) meet him on campus when he is leaving class and ask if i can come over that night.
right now, im thinking plan 1.  i dont want to drag this on any further.  let me know what you guys think.
talk to you soon."

"event","when i was trying to decide where to spend my summer, i was torn between crossing the country to new york and staying in california at stanford.  i had this weird feeling about new york.  i did not know what it was, but something was telling me to go to new york despite all of my fears of being away from family and going so far away from familiarity.  i felt that something would happen in my life that would not happen if i was at harvard, stanford, or ucsf.  and that something has definitely happened and i know that the something will continue to happen until i get back to ucla.

during my summer at stanford, i fell in love with research.  i loved questioning experiments, and wondering what happened inside different cells, how different proteins interacted with each other and how that affected the behavior of the cell.  when i returned to ucla, i lost that passion somewhere.  in between rubin's laziness in organic chemistry and my struggles in my physiological sciences lab, i myself became lazy and stopped trying to excel in everything that i did.  i remembered how i used to be so excited to study and know everything about a certain subject, but i just couldnt get myself back into that groove.  i went back and forth trying to figure out what took me out of my over-achieving state, and how i could get back into it.  maybe andrew?  i did spend a lot of time on the phone with him, taking weekends off to spend with him.  maybe living with jasmin?  we spent a lot of time chatting.  maybe spending way too much time doing nothing?  i dont know what it was.  i never figured out how to get out of it.  all i needed was some motivation.  some knowledge of why this whole college thing was important, why science was important, why anyone cared about anything.  why do some people put so much time into museums?  into parks?  why do people do the jobs that they do?  why are those jobs important?  

well, right now, i still do not know the answers to those questions.  but, i have thought about so many things while being out here in new york.  i have questioneed my enjoyment of science.  what type of science do i like?  should i switch majors to chemistry?  should i switch labs to a synthesis lab?  do i want to go to graduate school?  what would i do if i didnt go?  (ok, mcdonalds...NOOOO!!!)  i have time to think what it is about science that i like, and why i havent been happy with labs in so long.  what do i look for in a lab, what do i need to be productive?

i am getting back into the exploration world.  what is there to do for a scientist that doesnt want to be a doctor?  do i really want to be a professor and run my own lab?  or do i want to go into industry, drug development, pharmaceuticals?  am i business minded?  could i go into that kind of science?  what would i need to do as an undergraduate to get a job like that?  would i need a phd?  a post doc?  man, when i have time to ask questions, it is amazing.  i love it.

so, i am still deciding.  amongst all the horrible things happening to me this summer, i cannot return to my lab at ucla, and must find another.  maybe that is a good thing.  i think im going to try an organic synthesis lab.

sorry if none of this makes sense.  im not sure it really makes sense to me and it will ruin my mood to proofread this post.

love and miss you all!"

"event","this week has been so hard.  not only are classes stressing me out during week one with a quiz and reading and a presentation to prepare, i am suffering from turning cold turkey on my addiction to andrew.  almost every moment of my spring break was spent staring into his eyes, driving around in his hot suburu, snuggling on his futon just being wrapped inside his arms having lovey-dovey conversations, engaging in tickle-wars, or hanging out with him and his friends.  it was a week full of laughter and happiness, a full week, like no week that i have ever had in my life.  and now, it is all memory.  a wave of depression has settled over my being and i have nothing to compel me to study or write or read.  all i want to do is be with him, and now even phone conversations are unsatisfying.  before i loved just talking to him on the phone for hours, but now it seems so bland compared to what we had last week.  i will see him three weekends in the next two months, which is great.  after that we will have a couple days together to say goodbye for the summer, ten long weeks comparable to what i am experiencing now, minus the quizzes and exams.  but, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and we will have at least two weeks together in september, most of which will be spent in europe.  i will finally have a shoulder to lean on during my flight, because he will be right beside me.  andrew amazes me more and more each day.  little things that he does that show me how important i am to him cause me to daydream about our past and future together all day and have me sitting up in bed just thinking how amazing he really is.  in case you dont know, he landed a great internship as an investment banker for the summer, and will be studying to get his masters next year at stanford.  im so proud of him i could pinch his cheeks.  well, maybe i did, but just jokingly.  and as much as i want to surrender to life that took over me last week, waiting on him and cleaning his room and just being there to do things with him without doing any activities for myself, there is no way that could happen.  one of the things that makes our relationship work is our respect and pride for each other's lives.  if spring break were every week, we would lose that essence because the only thing i would be living for is the happiness he brings to my life, and not any bit for the happiness i bring to my own.  i think the happiness each person brings to their own lives makes a relationship work because they each have something to share, something to show excitement about, and something to distract you from thinking how perfect the relationship is.

so, back to the real world of reading and papers and presentations.  next time i see him i wont be sitting around playing zuma and watching movies.  we will both be sitting in the library studying like big nerds do when they are in love."

"event","this morning i planned out my entire week until monday night, at which point i will only have one final left.  every hour is dedicated to something, and it makes me realize how boring the week will be.  but, come wednesday night, magic will happen.  andrew will show up, after the oc of course, unless its before, i cant be interrupted, and we will hug and kiss and cuddle, and ohh, the magic.  thursday we will sleep in and ill take him to my lab to see my cool crystals, then head to my house to meet katie and do laundry.  friday we will hang out with his parents and saturday morning too.  we are going to drive up the coast, stopping in santa barbara and staying in morro bay.  the place i found looks so nice.  they have a spa there, and i think im going to get a massage.  on sunday we will drive to stanford, stopping to watch the sunset in big sur.  ill spend the rest of the week with him, until the sunday before classes.  we already have plane tickets for three weekends during the quarter, and he should be making reservations to come for my birthday as well.  one of the weekends we are going to see mama mia at the pantages, and hopefully jazz and her sister and emily and her man will come with us.  but, the best part is that he wants to come down and see me before i head to new york.  i was so nervous that it would really be 11 or 12 weeks that i would have to go without him, but he is going to come spend a day with me right before i go.  and we talked again about europe.  i think he might start talking to his parents about it soon, and then it will be time to start booking everything.  i am so so so excited.  he is the best, and i love spending time with him and making these plans to do things with him.  i might actually fly out to san francisco one weekend this summer to see him.  thinking of him never fails to bring a smile to my face.  but, studying for final always fails.  im watching animal planet right now on crocs and hippos....all you summer friends, im on tv!  uh oh, its proving how hippos are more deadly than crocs!  AHHHH.  be afraid, be very afraid!
oh veronica: i had my nobel prize winning idea in organic chemistry this week.  i immediately thought of you.  we definitely need labs next door to each other!
other big news, i talked to andrew's friend chris last night on the phone (i was being passed around at the pizza party).  he is so cool, and i wish he lived on andrew's floor so i could get to know him like i know his friend johnny.  i also love this girl jenny, who lives across the hall from andrew.  we like to gossip about the boys.  maybe i will call her tonight...hmmm.....  she transfered to stanford from berkeley and is from socal.  i think thousand oaks?  not sure.  
alright...quick nap before i meet with my presentation partner."

i want to let you see
you are everything and more to me
i will let you be i will i will

andrew just got a summer internship at deutsche bank, in san fransisco.  i guess he says its one of the largest banks in europe.  im so proud of him, and so happy that i just want to jump up and down and hug and kiss him, but i cant, and it is killing me.  i got off of the phone with him after he told me because he is running out of day time minutes (i wonder why?) and i felt so sad, i just wanted to keep talking to him as if the more i talked the closer i would get to him and be able to see his smiling face.  i am so in love with him, and this distance is somewhat bearable when nothing important like getting a huge summer internship happens.  kind of sucks that i didnt pick stanford because we could theoretically see each other every weekend.  but we both know that cold spring harbor is something that i couldnt pass up, and it will be an amazing opportunity.  so now i have two and a half weeks to wait to see him, which seems like an eternity.  i mean i have 3 finals and a paper to get through just to see him.  he is so amazing and makes me feel amazing, and i just absolutely love being with him, even if 90% of our relationship is talking on the phone.  except....big news....i bought him and i webcams (they were 10 bucks on ebay), so now we can watch each other while we talk on instant messenger.  i just shipped his today and i used mine yesterday, and he could see me.  it is so weird how satisfying it will be for me to see him in a 1 inch box on my computer.  regardless, i cant wait for him to get his so that i can see him.  he just bought a new computer too, a dell, which should be awesome and super fast.  makes me want to get a new computer.  but, mine works just fine.  i am so grateful right now that i get to share my life with him.  and it kills me that i cant just think about him and talk to him all day for the next two and a half weeks, but instead i have to read and cram for finals.

so, conclusion: andrew is amazing."

"event","i am in a weird mood right now.  i have decided to go to new york this summer.  for those of you that are unaware of this huge decision, let me fill you in.  last weekend i went to stanford to see my love, but i also met with the professor in whose lab i spent last summer.  we began to make plans for me to return to his lab for the summer.  the reason why this lab would be great are because i love working with doug and bill, they are fun, amazing, and extremely intelligent; but also because it would be a great experience for me to be in charge of my own research project which would be great preparation for graduate school and would look amazing on a grad school application.  however, i was accepted into a summer program at the cold spring harbor laboratory.  this is the most selective summer undergraduate research program, 25 students out of 485 applications were chosen, and i was one of them.  i was going to turn it down for stanford.  during the program, i will get to have dinner with james watson, watson and crick watson, the guy who determined the structure of DNA, and they will take us to a broadway show in new york.  i will spend the summer with possibly the 24 best undergraduate scientists in the nation.  so im sad right now because it is so far away.  far away from my parents, jasmin, ardeshir, familiarity.  the majority of the time i have spent back east has been with at least one of my parents, or an adult that i was very close to.  i cant stand being alone.  im hope that once i get there i will forget just how far away i really am.  i am such a baby, a very clingy baby.  at the same time, i am pissed off to all hell that i cannot think of a time that i will get to spend more that one week with andrew.  i love him so much, and i cant be around him.  im crying right now as i write this because it is the saddest thing.  enrique iglesias's ""escape"" just came on the radio.  ""you can run you can hide but you cant escape my love"".  andrew, you cant.  come to new york.  still crying.  did i mention im a baby?  this is killing me.  now ""milkshake"" is on.  ok, no more crying.  so....new york...i am going to try and get into a lab that does research on apoptosis, which i am OBSESSED about.  i think i have a good shot because bill (at stanford) knows a woman at cold spring harbor that is in structural biology that studies apoptotic proteins.  it should be amazing.  there are not any apoptosis labs at ucla, so it is a great opportunity.  i guess by my acceptance into this research program, that i should not worry about getting into grad school.  but, my grades are shitty, well, getting shitty.  i have been studying all day, and im about to finish this so that i can go back to studying.  ""a thousand miles"" vanessa carlton is on now.  god, if i could fall into the sky and land in roble's front lawn, i would be SOOOO grateful.  grades....so right now im right at the B+, almost A- range.  im trying to get a's on this next round of midterms, then a's on the finals, then my gpa will get back to normal.  so, pray for me, those of you that pray.  ok, back to molecular biology.  derek, i hope this will satisfy you for a couple weeks."

"event","so yesterday i was on the verge of breakdown.  i am so stressed out and so overwhelmed by everything i just wanted to give up.  lab is stressing me out more that i could ever imagine.  the feeling of being stupid and incapable of doing anything haunts me and i need to get out.  on top of that i have so much studying to do.  i got back all of my midterms, and i was so close to A's on two, and close to a perfect on the other.  i think if i just put in a little more time i can get the A's i want and think i deserve.  i cannot wait to spend this next week with andrew.  i am so in love with him and i think being able to see him tonight will be so good for my mood and situation.  he is amazing and has been extremely helpful during my freaking out times.  i just need to solve my lab situation because it is causing negative effects in other parts of my life.  im on my way to talk to the master, dr. weiss and tomorrow im going to talk to my favorite pi, dr. weis.  haha, two different people, similar last name.  also, i am so torn as to where to do research this summer.  i have high expectations of getting into harvard, low for cold spring harbor, and i dont care about ucsf.  i really want to go back to stanford but i dont know if getting $3000 less money and not having harvards name on my resume is the best decision for me right now.  i guess there is always harvard next summer, but i think i may have to stay at ucla next summer to get some kind of publication or something.  on top of that, i really just want to be with andrew this summer, and it is killing me that it seems like i will actually see him less during the summer than i do now.  is that possible?  i guess with the two of us anything is possible.  i also want to go to europe.  my sister is going to germany with her friend.  i want to go to france to see my foreign exchange student, to italy because andrew has talked so highly of it and i want to try REAL italian food, and to spain, because it just seems so full of life and culture.  i want to see veronica like i want an A in all my classes.  i think about her all the time, but i just cant seem to get it together to see her.  thats also why i want to go to harvard, but then, lia may be at stanford!  geez the choices.  and all you thinking that andrew will also be at stanford, i doubt it.  remember he was there for summer classes.  alright, back to my line of tasks for the day: new lab.  love you guys.

"event","i am in love.  andrew was here this weekend.  thursday i was trying to distract myself all day from his arrival, but it was just impossible.  he called me from downstairs, and i swear, everytime i see him, its like im seeing him after years of not seeing him.  i get goosebumps and a smile leaps on my face.  i gave him this mustang calendar that i bought for him, and of course he loved it.  he bought me some stevie wonder cd's that i am still trying to acquire a taste for.  friday we went to lunch with jazz, emily, and heather.  its so funny how people in the dining hall for the first time follow you around as if they cant find the food on their own.  anyway, we went to physics together (yes, i tortured him with physics, pointing out the couple hot guys, my study friend, and the mini-johnny).  i resisted with all my might not to be those lame-o kids around campus that are all over each other while they are walking around.  but for some reason, i kept forgetting we were on campus together.  something about the i-never-see-him-ness took away that feeling.  afterwards we went to enroll me in 2 more units, putting me at a wonderful 21 for the quarter.  he bought some basketball shoes and sat through my meeting with dr. weiss (faculty mentor).  when we got back to my room we were cuddling on my bed.  i told him that i wanted to give him a present that i bought him.  he closed his eyes and when he opened them i handed him a little teddy bear that says ""someone at ucla loves me"" on the t-shirt.  andrew told me he loved me on new years eve, and i didnt say anything back.  i wanted to wait until it killed me to not say it.  and, it did.  i told him that i have been wanting to tell him for a while, and it had been killing me that i didnt have the opportunity to do so.  he smiled, then i lightly pressed my lips next to his and whispered ""i love you"".  he smiled, and hugged me, and was silent.  i was so worried that he didnt feel that he loved me anymore.  but then he said it, and we were both so happy.  ahh, romance, im sure it makes many of you sick.  moving on, that night we went and saw chicago the musical.  we had to take the bus, which i am oh-so-familiar with doing.  i had to call derek to make sure i had the right bus stop, which i didnt.  then when we got on the bus, andrew had the money, and the driver started to go and he almost fell over.  haha.  we sat down and he was talking so loud, and he got up to get a bus route map, letting everyone know that we didnt know what we were doing, which i hate!  oh well, it was fine.  we walked past a buch of hollywood stars in the freezing cold, and to a subway for dinner.  the theater was just beautiful, and the musical was amazing.  those woman had the best voices i have ever heard on stage before.  on the way home we got on the wrong bus and had to wait around for another one.  once we got to westwood andrew tried to tell the driver where we wanted to get off, and i promptly told the driver to keep going.  like andrew knew where we were going.  psh.  we went back to the room and warmed ourselves up, if you know what im saying.  3 weeks is a long ass time to go without some loving.  alright, jazz is going to bed, the story must wait!"

    You were probably the last among your friends to have sex. And the first to pretend that you're pregnant. LOL. Though you're inclined to use sex as weapon, at least it's not as one of mass destruction. You're choosier than most about your partners. A supportive relationship is what you're really after. Whether you know it or not, you need something steady & long-term. And soothing.

from Candide:
A hundred times I wanted to kill myself, but always I loved life more.  This ridiculous weakness is perhaps one of our worst instincts; is anything more stupid than choosing to carry a burden that really one wants to cast on the ground? to hold existence in horror, and yet to cling to it? to fondle the serpent which devours us till it has eaten out our heart?
from the Sorrows of Young Werther:
I can't recall ever having felt so light.  I was transported!  To hold the dearest creature in the world in my arms and fly through the room with her until everything around me was lost and...William, to be frank, I swore to myself then and there that the girl whom I loved and to whom I therefore had certain rights should never waltz with anyone but me, and if it should prove to be my downfall!  Can you understand me?

how amazing would it be if the person i was with would say something like that to me?  the part from werther, not candide of course.  however, i feel as torn between true love and comprimise as the old woman from candide is torn between life and death.  if there was such thing as true love, it would be amazing, and i would feel like the most amazing woman in the world, making my lover feel equally as amazing.  at the same time, i feel that the love that will turn into marriage in my life will be more of an acceptance that i can love the man and live with him, but may not be in love with him.  so, i want to have true love, but i dont think it will happen and so i attempt to merely learn to love and comprimise rather than wait for true love.  my parents are wonderful and i never want them to split, but they are not in love.  they love each other and live well together, they have two daughters, and thus they are together.  had my mother not gotten pregnant with me four months after their first date, i doubt they would be together today.  and i have somewhat adopted that perspective of marriage into my life.  i just accept that i wont find true love, even though i want it more than anything.  true love is an image, a utopia, that human nature ruins the existence of.  jasmin says that she is only attracted to assholes.  obviously she doesnt want that for herself, that is just how she is.  if i look for true love, i will only be dissapointed and hurt when the person does something that does not fit into my image of love.

on that note, andrew is coming tomorrow.  as always before i see him, i get the urge to not see him.  i dont know why that is.  two days ago i wanted nothing more than for him to come that very instant.  maybe that is because i knew he couldnt.  but as his arrival gets closer, i start thinkig of every reason why i shouldnt like him and why the relationship wont work.  when he gets here, those thoughts disappear until one day before our next rendezvous.  so what is love when i dont believe that i wont ever find it?  how do i know the feeling?  i truly believe i was in love with ardeshir, and i still love him now, just differently.  we dont say ""i love you"" to each other, we just know that we do.  i just dont know how to judge when i am in love with someone.  i used to think that when i had a burning feeling inside to tell the person that i could not hold it in one more instant, i would say those three words.  so i had that burning two weeks ago, and now its gone.  that is why i dont want to start saying it.  i know me, and i know i wont feel that way forever.

for some reason, i tack a definition to certain things.  marriage defines sex and love defines marriage.  therefore, by saying i love someone, i am saying i want to marry that person.  so obviously when i said it to ardeshir, we thought we would get married.  duh, we didnt.  andrew was talking to me the other day about my saving sex til im married.  he was saying that he doesnt really want to go around sleeping with everyone, but he wants to share the experience of sex with people that are special to him.  from that i reasoned that to him love is something that he will share with people that are special to him, in contrast to my view of the emotion.  to him, it is easy to love someone that will not always be in his life.  for me, not so easy.  i totally understand this perspective though, and somewhat wish that i could adopt it in some ways.  why should i wait to share love?  to not get hurt?  well, thats part of love isnt it?  but, if i say that i will fall in love with people just for the sake of loving those who are special in my life, why not make it that much more meaningful and have sex?  but, that wouldnt happen.  i dont know why i am so intransigent about this issue.  frankly, whenever andrew and i talk about it, despite what he says, i always feel stupid for wanting to wait.  i guess i just cant explain it well enough.  and the more we talk about it, the more it seems to him that he is thinking about the next girl that will be special to him that he can have sex with.  wow, that sure makes me feel amazing.  i dont know what to do or think.  for now, ill just wait it out.  if the hot six foot milatto that i saw today speaks to me, then maybe ill analyze this relationship im in a little more.  until then, im content."

i dont so much want to kill him anymore.  oh, side note, i REALLY want to come to harvard this summer to be with you and work in the apoptosis lab.  so, andrew.  on the phone he was blabbering on about his senior project and all the ideas that he had and thoroughly explained to me had already been put into existence in europe.  the whole time i was thinking how he would never want nor let me blabber on about science stuff.  i had just discovered the amazingness of this lab, and i wanted to tell him, but he didnt want to hear it.  he began to laugh saying how my stuff didnt have any application to him.  so we went on about that.  the thing is, i feel like he thinks my stuff is less important than his so much that he can tell me stuff but i cant tell him.  i told him it hurt my feelings and he kinda laughed.  after we talked again and made up, we both realized how similar we are.  we both want to be right and we are stubborn about it.  but, i love being with him.  i love the way he frustrates me.  i love how cute he is and the images i get of him smiling in my head.  i cannot wait until he comes just two short days from now.  we are going to see chicago the musical with patrick swayze at the pantages.  we plan on watching movies and snuggling.  im excited.  im also going to make him snake drake with me (stadiums).  it is so hard to see him so infrequently because he means so much to me.  also last night i said something totally ridiculous and uncalled for.  i was sitting in the hall talking to andrew on the phone and my friends asked who i was talking to, for which i replied ""this stupid boy from stanford"" in a playful way.  even though i truly did not mean that he was stupid, i shouldn't have said it.  i realized it was something i said when i was with ardeshir, when i was a horrible girlfriend.  but i dont want to be like that anymore, not with andrew.  so i called him this morning and apologized.  bonus: i had a dream last night that he gave me syphillis!  wtf?  kinda strange.  big events: valentines with him, ill be visiting for just under a week.  i hope its special and accompanied by silver.  haha. spring break, which may or may not be happening.  he needs to hang with his bros and see his parents.  i may be put on the backburner.  we have made some temporary plans to go on a road trip though.  i finish finals wednesday night of his spring break, and he may drive down from stanford and then thursday we will head to santa barbara, then to yosemite, then to stanford.  we will see.  maybe big sur veronica.  i would think of you the whole time.  i miss you so much, and i really hope i get to spend the summer with you.  you are amazing!  i love you so much.

"event","andrew bought the book high fidelity for my by nick hornby.  this is the same author as about a boy.  i read it today, the whole thing minus the thirty pages i read yesterday before bed.  it is about this no-good loser guy who dropped out of college because a girl left him that is 36 and all his friends are married with 2 children and all he has to talk about is how his girlfriend just left him.  he is one of these guys that does nothing, is probably totally grungy and will never get married.  i felt like i needed to rush out and get married like britney spears or i would never be married.  i mean, after school, where do you meet people that you could possibly consider marrying?  i dont want to be left alone that is for sure.  i dont really want to get married until i graduate college, so hopefully i am dating someone at the time or all of my worst nightmares will come true.  the book itself is not so great.  one of those easy reads that doesnt take near as much thinking as say the heart of darkness or catch-22.  however, hornby does have a good writing style.  he knows how to put thoughts to words as honestly as i have ever read.  it is amazing how accurately he describes thoughts.  if you have seen about a boy, you know it is one of those movies where the actors talk to themselves and you can hear it.  well, hornby is that kind of author.  most of the book is the main character's daydreams. stuff he is thinking about when he isnt talking to anyone.  its funny, one of the critics that is listed on the back of the book says ""keep this book away from your girlfriend--it contains too many of your secrets to let it fall into the wrong hands""  funny, andrew bought it for me.  the andrew update will come another night.  possibly tuesday when i am sitting in my dorm alone.  oh, how i cant wait to get back to my dorm room.  i miss it SOO much.  i miss not being bitched at by my parents for staying on the phone til 4 in the morning.  i really miss sitting in bed with my computer and watching tv all at the same time.  i miss how i just cleaned it for 6 hours and i havent even been able to reap the benefits yet.  back to the book, i really think that derek will like it.  rob, the narrator/main character, makes all of these lists about movies and books, and that seems to be all that derek is into these days.  not like i think derek is as hopeless as i think rob is, i just think that he and derek may have some common interests.  and, i want to share a few passages with you all from the book.  just some of the highlights i guess.

1)rob cheated on laura who ended up being pregnant at the time and when she found out about the affair, had an abortion
""i asked her why she had stuck with it.
she thought for a long time
'because i'd never stuck at anything before, and id made a promise to myself when we started seeing each other that i'd make it through at least one bad patch, just to see what happened.  so i did.  and you were so pathetically sorry about that idiotic rosie womant...'--rosie, the four-bonk, simultaneous orgasm, pain-in-the-arse girl, the girl i was seeing when Laura was pregnant--'...that you were very nice to me for quite a long time, and that was just what i needed.  we go quite deep, rob, if only because we've been together a reasonable length of time.  and i didn't want to knock it all over and start again unless i really had to. so'
and why had i stuck with it?  not for reasons as noble and adult as that. (is there anything more adult than sticking with a relationship that's falling apart in the hope that you can put it right?  i've never dont that in my life.)  i stuck with it because, suddenly, right at the end of the rose thing, i found myself really attracted to laura again; it was like i needed rosie to spice laura up a bit.  and i thought id blown it (i didnt know then that she was experimenting with stoicism).  i could see her losing interest in me, so i worked like mad to get that interest back, and when i got it back, i lost interest in her all over again.  that sort of happens to me a lot, i find.  i dont know how to sort it out.""

and i think that is what marriage, and to some extent, a serious relationship, is more or less like.  you have to stick it out through the bad patches.  in these fickle relationships we are in now, we can just break up with the person if they kiss someone else or have sex with someone else or lie or whatever.  but when you care about a person, you care enough to work through little things like that.  i mean, my parents i dont believe are madly in love with each other, but they care a lot about each other and they wouldnt get a divorce over something small or even large that they didnt first try to work out.  if that were the case, they would have been separated long ago.

2)rob's enlightenment
""so maybe what i said before, about how listening to too many records messes your life up...maybe theres something in it after all.  david owne, he married, right?  he's taken care of all that, and now he's a big-shot diplomat.  the guy who came into the shop with the suit and the car keys, hes married, too, and now hes, i dont know, a businessman.  me, im unmarried--at the moment as unmarried as its possible to be--and im the owner of a failing record shop.  it seems to me that if you place music (and books, probably, and films, and plays, and anything that makes you feel) at the center of your being, then you cant afford to sort out your love life, start to think of it as the finished product.  youve got to pick at it, keep it alive and in turmoil, youve got to pick at it and unravel it until it all comes apart and youre compelled to start all over again.  maybe we all live life at too high a pitch, those of us who absorb emotional things all day, and as a consequence we can never feel merely content: we have to be unhappy, or ecstatically, head-over-heels happy, and those states are difficult to achieve within a stable, solid relationship.  maybe al green is directly responsible for more than i ever realized.""

i think that there is something in rob that is like every person in a relationship.  i mean, that critic said that it gives all of guys' secrets away, basically by telling the thoughts of a regular joe schmo verbatim.  but the thing is, i think the same way as rob did, some of the time.  it makes me hopeful for a nice relationship where i am happily in love.  god, love is such a hard state to achieve.  and i think the more people that you consider that you were at once ""in love"" with, the harder it becomes to be ""in love"" because you continually compare the new person to the old, and they will never be the same, as hard as you force the similarities.  people change, and so does the way that they love someone, and the way they want to be loved.  i mean, i sometimes think about past relationships, but they are merely frozen memories.  there is no way i could be with the chris that i was with freshman year, or the ardeshir i was with senior year.  i am a different person, and so are they.  but, they are happy memories and i really enjoy remembering what once was.  not to relive it, but just to remember.  one day i will be so old and i wont remember, so i am grateful now.  hahaha.  i am also grateful for the relationship that i am in now.  nothing can be as exciting as the present.

3)marie, the song-writer that rob has sex with after laura leaves him, performs at his shop.  these are merely his thoughts
""she's [marie] great, and when she sings, i wish that i werent living with laura, and that my night with marie had gone better than it did.  maybe next time, if there is a next time, i wont feel so miserable about laura going, and then things might be different with marie, and...but im always going to feel miserable about laura going.  thats what ive learned.  so i should be happy that shes staying, right?  thats how it should work, right?  and thats how it does work.  kind of.  when i dont think about it too hard.""

most of the time, i dont know why i like the person i am dating.  i dont remember why i wanted to date derek, or why i was in love with ardeshir.  i most importantly dont know why i want to be with andrew so much.  but the important thing is that i do.  i really want to be with andrew right now.  sure, he has done some things to piss me off and hurt my feelings, but its a rough patch right?  he is seriously sorry, so why not?  i dont know, what he did wasnt enough to make me not want to be with him.  it was enough to make me mad, but not to ditch him entirely.  he is going to have to do something meaner and more inconsiderate to get rid of me.

alright, thats enough for the night.  im sure i have thoroughly bored all of you with my fascination with literature, if you can call high fidelity literature.  im in the middle of catch-22 and i just started (1.5 pages worth) of go tell it on the mountain by james baldwin.  those will be more passionate entries im sure.  this book just came at the right time from the right guy."

"event","i just read christine's xmas entry and her talking about family made me think of a family story.  my mom's dad wrote poetry, and he wrote this one poem in calligraphy and framed it.  my ultimate favorite poem.  i re-did the walls of my room during my intense cleaning the past two weeks, and i decided i wanted it on my wall.  my mom lost it.  its funny because i am such a nostalgic person and i want to save things that remind me of everything.  i was talking to my mom's sister about this poem and she started talking about her father.  my mom and her sister are 9 years apart, my mom the youngest, and accidental child conceived after her father returned from war, a baby boomer.  after he returned from war, he was extremeley depressed.  he actually started to have an affair which lead to a divorce and another marriage.  basically, the father that my mom's siter grew up with was totally different than the father my mom grew up with.  i guess that he left when my mother was maybe 4.  she used to visit him in california, where he lived with his new wife.  he took her to huntington beach and she said that she always remembered wanting to live in huntington beach.  funny, that is where we live now.  i love these stories.  i love hearing about the personalities of people i never met, their legacy.  over the summer i went back and i met my father's mother's side of the family, and they were just so intriguing.  im sure that they all piss people off in so many different ways, but i just ignore those facts because it is nice to actually know them and to hear what it was like for them growing up.  i never met my father's mother or my mother's father because they were dead when i was born.  to me, any story is a good story.  i just love hearing about the people that they were, and am so sad that i will never meet them and connect personality traits of my own to theirs.  so, in light of all this, here is my grandfather's poem:

in this
     cracked plaster world
     with its steel mirrors
     and doors with outside locks

somewhere
     there are baby's clutching hands
     and crushed peppermint
     and welcome home

and you are
     and you will be
          and all is well"

"event","thank the lord she is in my life right now.  this is just a little summary of what ive been feeling, through her amazing lyrics.

""kiss me fool""
tell me whome should i be to make you love me
tell me what does it mean to be alone
cant you see me standing staring out from a distance
hear my cry if youd only listen
out of focus into me and you

kiss me fool if ya care
if your words have any meaning
playing it cool is so unfair
why this veil of secrecy
god forbid
im aware that ll in love is fair
but thats no reason to make me feel this way
and it hurts me so bad to deny it
and these feelings are out of control

do you know what its like to want something so bad
and then having to let it go
and it hurts me to know that this time in our lives
so soon will be in the past
and we spend it pretending and playing it cool
never knowing what we could have had
you got me wondering if im
good enough
pretty enough
giving enough
special enough
god, tell me whom should i be to make you love me

no kidding, that is what im thinking.  its crazy how sometimes there seems to be a song that fits your emotions so exactly.  i love music.  more next week.  i promise."

"event","i really dont like to study.  i just sit around and think of the reasons why i dont want to study.  i dont know what it is.  thursday i just couldnt get my mind to focus on anything.  i felt like my brain was mush.  yesterday i snaked drake.  i just get so high off of doing that.  when im done my legs are just shaking and my heart is pounding out of my chest and its hard to breathe.  i just love the feeling.  after i showered i was very ready to study and quite focused.  it was amazing.  i studied more yesterday than i did cumulatively in 3 days.  so now here it is saturday, ive been awake 4.5 hours and maybe studied 1/2 hour.  on the way to brunch i got this striking pain in my right kidney region.  then, sitting at brunch today my whole body just started aching and i felt like i was going to hurl.  as i sit here i am having striking pains in my brain.  god, i dont know whats going on.  im tired even though i slept 8 hours.  i really need to study, but i just feel physically incapable.  jasmin has the flu, and i am scared that she gave it to me.  that would just really suck.  but, i have the room to myself for the afternoon, so im going to shut my computer off and take advantage of that.  the study lounge is packed with noisy people, and i actually cleaned my room yesterday so my desk is pretty clean.

just a few things before i go about things im looking forward to over break: 1) my friend john that is now living in germany is coming home.  i havent seen him since may.  i am really excited.  i dont really know what we will do because we dont really ""hang"" out that much.  he will probably just come over and play pool or something.  maybe watch a movie, some golf, who knows.  we used to go drinking when i was in high school but since he became legal that hasnt really happened.  plus, drinking puts me in the mood to get ass, and the person i want ass from would not be john.  2) i want to read books.  i am in the middle of catch-22 now.  it is so good.  i have the list of the 20th century's greatest novels and im going to buy some books over break.  im excited.  3) going to the gym everyday for 2 hours.  i love doing that.  it isnt as satisfying as snaking drake but i also love lifting.  especially the pull up machine.  yum.  4) im going to see the starlight express and possibly rent.  i love musicals and i just think that it will be awesome.  5) my sister.  i miss her.  whenever i went home this quarter she was always off doing stuff.  the thing is, when she is around her boyfriend she totally treats me like shit.  but, when he is gone, she will sit up and talk to me for hours.  i think im going to go christmas shopping with her.  hopefully we wont get into too many fights over sharing the car.  i wish it were easier.  6) doing nothing all day and not feeling guilty.  i do a lot of nothing here at school, but i am thining about how i should be studying.  doing nothing over break is just so much fun.  i almost never get bored.  especially now cuz im gonna read books.  7) hopefully i will get to see my good buddy david cunningham.  he is awesome.  i know him from my old work.  he is so much fun..i used to just go to his office and sit there for an hour or so and talk.  everytime i go home pretty much i stop by and see him.  now he works offshore on the oil platform emmy and i cant just drop in.  but, we will meet up im sure.  8) andrew of course.  no need to explain.

thats all for now.  email me.  i wont be on instant messenger for the week if i can hold it in.

"event","i really dont like thanksgiving food, well christmas and easter food too because they are pretty much the same.  i really dont like turkey and stuffing and i eat rolls all the time, im a bread freak.  mashed potatoes dont really do much for me anymore either.  about 2 weeks ago i came home on a monday for a thanksgiving dinner at my cousins house, the whole family thing.  it was nice, i didnt eat much cuz i dont like that food but i liked seeing my family.  last night we had a thanksgiving dinner with just my parents and sister and her lame ass boyfriend, steak and lobster.  i could have done without the lobster, but man that was good.  they had twice baked potatoes, but i passed.  amazingly, i also wasnt too fond of the crescent rolls they had.  weird.  and today, the actual day of thanksgiving, my sister was going to her boyfriends house and my parents were going to church.  i didnt want to go to church when i could stay home and eat stuff like honey nut cheerios.  this morning i woke up around 930am, and man did it feel nice.  9 1/2 hours of sleep.  well, ray called at 645am but i promptly got off the phone.  what were you thinking dude?  at 1030 i went to the gym til 12 and i saw my mom's personal trainer that i picked for her.  this girl is just amazing.  she is so nice.  she told me what to do about my back.  she had my lay on my stomach and was pressing all over my ass and lower back and felt it spazaming.  thats gross.  so now i have to treat it and lay off on some of my lifting which sucks.  but i loved being at the gym again.  they were playing awesome music and i was just having a grand old time.  after the gym i lounged around for a while, ate a ham sandwhich, string cheese and honey nut cherrios.  i took a shower a very long shower according to my standards while listening to my sugarcult cd which is amazing and i havent heard it in so long.  around 2 i felt sleepy so i went to take a nap.  my mom wanted me to be at church at 3.  ahh, too bad i didnt wake up til 4!  i woke up so rested and in such a good mood.  in the spirit of pumpkin pie, i went to church.  i figured they had been eating for an hour so i would be just in time for pie.  i was wrong.  but, i didnt have to eat all that food.  i actually like creamed corn so i had a little of that, 2 rolls, and chips and salsa.  then i had 2 pieces of pumpkin pie and that was my dinner.  it was the best dinner i could have asked for! but it wasnt really dinner at all.  i was there for 2 hours: we were bagging on my mother being from kansas (she is really from independence missouri, but that is so close to kansas we can still poke fun), and this one lady was an epidemiologist.  i asked her obviously as a fellow scientist all about her job and how she got there.  then this other lady told me about how she got to where she was today, which was actually not a bad story.  when i got home there was this huge racoon in my backyard eating cat food!  i was just amazed that there are actually racoons in this part of town.  i was looking for a camera, but i couldnt find one.  my mom came home and she was flabbergasted as well.  i drove quickly to church to get my dads digital camera (church is about 1 minute away driving).  by the time i got home the food ran out so he left.  i just went downstairs and now there is this dinky ugly oppossum.  i hate those creatures.  i would rather have a racoon.  so now here it is 630 and i havent done one drop of work today.  i have to leave my house tomorrow at 7am to play golf in BFE.  i wont get home til late which sucks.  then saturday i have to leave at 6am for palm springs.  my dad is really killing me with these early mornings.  so tomorrow is my last day being at home.

the andrew update isnt as cheery as some of the other ones.  he had a shit load of work due on wednesday so tuesday i didnt get to talk to him.  wednesday he was going to call while he was in the airport but he didnt.  and last night online he asked when the next time he would see me would be which i thought that we had already talked about.  so it has me wondering why he would say that.  i am such a frickin scientist: everything has to mean something, it has to be evidence of something.  i was in such a shitty mood yesterday because i wanted to talk to him and deliberatley didnt go to the gym because he said he would call.  then at dinner i got in an argument that just lead to my sisters boyfriend saying stupid ass shit.  i just dont like him.  so when i was talking to andrew online i just wasnt all there and i was saying mean stuff, i think.  i just want him to call.  thats all.  i dont really want to talk online right now.  there is such a huge difference.  im a big phone person.  i want to hear his voice and i just like the difference in conversation.  he said he would call today.  we will just see.  i want him to come see me over break.  i wish that i could see him next weekend.  i want to see him more than i do.  but, i cannot be too picky i guess.  hopefully i will have a happy andrew update the next time i post.  i really like him.  i was reading through some of, well all of, my old entries where i talked about him and some of the things that i wrote i would only write if i really liked him.  they were really girly and stupid, but it was just my train of thought.  i always worry i guess that he doesnt like me.  and being in a long distance relationship, it is easy for my concious to start trying to convince me that i dont like him because of certain things that he does that would maybe point to him not liking me.  god im so weird.  whatever.  bottom line: i am so happy being with him and i dont want things to end.

sweet misery you cause me
thats what you called me 
sweet misery you cause me
and in my heart i see
what youre doing to me
and in my heart i see
just how you wanted it to be
sweet misery"

"event","hey everyone.  i am such a slacker for not updating in so long.  i dont even want to check how long it has been.  i have no excuse either.  i could say all this shit like school and midterms and whatever, but i would be lying because there was always a 10-30 minutes gap that i could have been venting to all of you about how i didnt want to study or that i was so excited to be seeing andrew or whatever.  so, here is the post for the weekend that just ended.  eventually i will randomly tell you stories of the days that i didnt update.

thursday at 5 was the scheduled time for my life science midterm.  i studied my ass off so that i could know the material so well i could plow through the test.  which i successfully did. the test was amazingly easy.  i was finished in 30 minutes time.  i got to the airport in time to make the 715pm flight, which i was originally scheduled to fly on.  but, the 6 o'clock flight got cancelled so the 7 o'clock flight was packed.  but, i got on the 8pm flight which left late.  regardless, i arrived in san jose with just enough time to get to stanford, changing into my dress in the car.  andrew even bought me roses.  he looked so hot in his suit from paris.  man, i looked hot in this red dress.  pictures will be available soon on snapfish.com.  ill post the info soon.  so, andrew had brought me dinner since i hadnt eaten all day.  but, since i hadnt eaten, it was hard for me to eat.  i was so excited to actually be there that my stomach was in a knot or something.  anyway, we went to the formal which was at this bar/restaurant.  it was fun only cuz i was tipsy.  it was in such a nice location overlooking the bay bridge, extremely romantic.  so romantic even that when andrew asked how much i liked him on a scale of one to ten and i said 8, he said that i was a 3.5.  gradually as the night went on i made it to a record low of 2.3.  yipee.  glad to know i busted my ass to get there for a reason.   but, i had a really fun time dancing with him.  a little alcohol works miracles.  on the way back on the bus, his friend johnny puked.  we made out the whole time.  it was really nice.  

friday morning, he got up and went to class.  i slept.  i got up and went to my lab around 12 and was there until he picked me up around 430.  we went walking around the stanford shopping mall, then to eat at this wrap place which i thought was pretty gross, and then we romantically watched the texas chainsaw massacre.  i think that he was more scared than i was.  when we got back to his dorm, we watched the end of dreamcatcher and then 2 hours of cribs with his friends.  i was so tired i fell asleep in my clothes.

saturday i got up around 1230 and read catch-22.  it is such an amzing book and im only on chapter 6 or so.  andrew slept til 2 when i woke him up.  we went to lunch and got some good ass pizza.  then we went shopping again.  this time at the great mall which is a place with a lot of outlets.  he bought me 3 guess shirts, and an anchor blue shirt and jeans.  he is so nice.  we went back to his dorm and started pre-partying.  this is was seriously the best night i have had in such a long time.  i only had 3 1/2 shots and was at the perfect state of drunkenness: going crazy but totally conscious of what i was doing.  andrew was scared i was going to get sick like last time, so he was trying to make me eat goldfish.  i kept running away from him and grabbing people's asses.  its was oh-so much fun.  i started bagging on stanford girls in front of them.  that was really funny too.  man they are a weird species of female.  we went to a party and saw one of andrew's past women.  that kind of sucked.  whatever.  we went back to his room and had lots of fun if you know what i mean.  i put those girls to shame.  4 hours worth.

sunday we got up early and went to breakfast.  we watched bedazzled and then screwed around, then he dropped me off at shante's house.  she drove me back.  i went to bed so early.  slept 10 1/2 hours last night.

so now, the more important news....how did i do on my midterm?  im totally kidding.  so, whats going on with us?  are we serious?  are we going to see each other again?  the rest of the quarter is just totally booked.  then its christmas.  the week after school i have jury duty.  then its christmas, family time.  i dont know that im ready to go up and see him in his home enviornment.  but, apparantly he is ready to come to mine.  he wants to come to the oc after christmas.  he will probably stay a week.  today i bought tickets to see a muscial which i have been wanting to see for years called starlight express.  very expensive but totally worth it.  so, we will be together at least through january.  baby steps i tell you.  i really like him.  the more i see him and talk to him, the more i like him.  when i went up there, so many people knew who i was that i had never heard of.  they just came up to me and were like ""you are brianna right?""  when i opened his door friday morning to go to the bathroom, his across the hall neighbor totally smiled, as if she were so happy that i was back to see andrew.  it was really cute.  also as i was leaving, a couple of people asked when i was coming back.  not til january.  but, i will be back.  i left my towel there, on purpose of course.  i told him im just going to buy stuff to leave there so i dont have to truck all this stuff back and forth each time.  hehe.  so, things are good.  my midterm went extremely well and im going to start studying for my o-chem midterm today.  research is going well.  i got accepted to another science conference: neural control of behavior. luckily this one is at ucla so no missing of classes will be taking place.  im actually trying to get no classes on thursday next quarter so then my trips to stanford will be from wednesday night til sunday.  its no big deal to miss friday classes.  anyway, that is the story and game plan for now.  im going to listen to michelle branch's breathe, which just came on.  ill leave you with some lyrics since you guys like them so much.  this is from a song called one of these days:
one of these days
i wont be afriad of staying with you
i hope and i pray
waiting to find a way back to you
cause thats where im home

what would you do if i could have you?
oh if i could
id let you feel everything im thinking
wouldnt that be nice?
one of these days
i wont be afraid of staying with you."

"event","alright, i know that in my last entry i said something along the lines of not wanting to talk to andrew til thursday...blah blah bullshit.  i have a huge knot in my stomach right now cuz i really want him to call.  he hasnt called since wednesday.  i really want to talk to him, and i really miss him.  im living up to my ""being difficult"" position as a woman.  im going to visit him on friday.  i was supposed to have a midterm on thursday, but it got moved to next monday.  the day after the weekend i am supposed to be up north with him.  that really sucks.  im going to have to study while im up there.  big fun.  alright, i need to study now.  the more i do now, the less ill have to do then."

how can you turn your back, tell me
why you love me like that?

for a couple of weeks i have been yearning to come home.  i missed my parents...hugging them, talking to them, seeing them, having them yell at me for eating by the couch...all the stuff that ticked at your nerves when you actually lived there.  i dont live here anymore.  i dont really live anywhere.  currently, i live in sproul hall.  in the summer im going to europe (instead of yale) and then im taking session C of summer school to graduate in 4 years, so i'll live somewhere else then.  hopefully de neve (ill get a job at the front desk to live there for cheapo).  so anyway, im sitting at home and i cannot wait to get back to school.  but the reason i cant wait to get back is because i find it so much easier to study there for some reason.  the one weekend that i actually stayed at school i studied seriously all weekend.  even during the football game.  geez.  and now i have a midterm on wednesday that i am totally not prepared for and studying all day yesterday would have helped a lot.  so now all i have is this afternoon.  hopefully i will get something done.
i have been doing a lot of traveling lately...detroit, alberquerque, san diego, palo alto.  i really want to go visit veronica.  she goes to harvard.  i miss her a lot and she is the one person that i was not reunited with at either of the conferences i attended.  well, also rob but he is in germany.  all of this traveling means roaming charges on my cell phone.  i had an extra $190 on my bill for last month.  then, i had to talk to andrew for 2 hours in san diego.  thats $75 alone.  so, my parents have another thing to bitch about, and i feel bad as well.  im just not going to use my cell phone anymore.  yeah, we will see how long that lasts.
so, goodbye home.  i wont be back until thanksgiving.  man, that will be a good entry.

just give me one good reason
tell me why i should stay
cuz i dont want to waste another moment
saying things we never meant to say
hold my breath and count to ten
ive been waiting for a chance to let you in

just bend the pieces til they fit
but they weren't made for it

i have not updated in an extremely long time.  i went to this science conference where i presented my research yet again.  only this time, i got totally beat up by all of these professors.  i felt like i didnt deserve to be there, that i didnt understand my own project, and worse, that they thought i didnt understand what i was presenting.  i got really depressed about being involved in science, like i didnt belong and i needed to find a new career goal.  i tried to study while at this conference, but i just couldnt get past reading one sentence.  i needed to study for my life science 2 midterm, but i just couldnt force myself to do it.  i didnt know what was wrong with me (not like i know as i write this either).  what good was i if i couldnt study or do science?  i may as well drop out of school.  and that is where i stand now: why shouldnt i just drop out of school?  i mean, no one is forcing me to be here, i can just live with my parents and get a lame-o job somewhere that will pay for my gym pass.  sure i'd be a social loser, but would it be easier?  probably not because i would beat myself up everyday for being such a loser, but i like to pretend that it is an easier life.

my first midterm was yesterday.  biology: organelles, membranes, enzymes, cell communication, cell respiration, photosynthesis.  pre meds.  i did horribly.  i heard that a lot of students get perfects from this professor.  why?  cuz they are premed and memorize everything.  i am a scientist.  i dont need to memorize anything.  i need to understand how the cell works and understand what happens to it if i do something to it or if something stops working or whatever.  i dont need to memorize it.  i will always have a bookshelf above my bench.  but, premeds can memorize very well.  they dont understand the importance of understanding, only of getting an A to get into med school.  on top of all this, i have an o-chem midterm on wednesday that i will probably get a C on since i have not been practicing everyday.  i now have (inluding tonight) 5 days (not including the day of the test) to understand 4 chapters.  yeah, that is going to happen.  so there goes another class.  AHHH.  i just want this quarter over.  i need to value the learning experience cuz i will be in these same 3 classes all year.  o-chem, o-chem lab, ls.  yipee.  so hopefully i will make all my mistakes this quarter and none winter and spring.

and as always, the andrew update.  im debating right now whether to say what i am really thinking and make this a private entry, or limit what i have to say and keep it open for everyone.  alright, private entry.  to start with, while i was in san diego, my good buddy lia, who i love, stayed with me.  andrew decided it was appropriate to call at 330am on friday night.  i didnt talk more than 15 minutes.  that was boorish (rude and insensitive, the word of the day on sunday).  lia was sleeping, and i didnt want to encourage him calling at that hour.  the next night when lia had to wake up at 430am, i called him to tell him to call me before midnight or so.  what time does he call?  4am.  he fell asleep on me.  and now lia totally hates me, and probably him more.  on tuesday i had this awesome workout and all of this stuff i wanted to tell andrew.  he called while i was in a review session, and he said he would call me back.  he didnt.  wednesday i sent him this mean text message, and then an apologetic one telling him to call me.  he did.  nice of him.  i asked him about this formal that his fraternity is having.  it turns out it is the same night as my next ls2 midterm and the test is 5-7pm.  it would be impossible to get to palo alto by 9pm for the event.  i asked him if he wanted me to ask about taking it early, and he said something along the lines of no, its ok, you are coming next weekend and that is enough.  oh, thanks.  i was like, so, after next weekend you are kicking me to the curb?  and he said yeah, pretty much.  that night i was taking a study break and i called him again.  god, i call a lot.  he totally calmed my nerves about the test and was awesome.  that was the last time that i talked to him.  i found out today that my cell phone bill for last month was $190 just for my phone's extra charges.  i calculated how much this 2 hour call i had with him while in san diego was, oh $75 for one call.  i just handed my dad my tax refund check.  fuck.  this boy is not only costing me money, hes costing stress and study time.  and, im just chump change to him.  so, i blocked him on aim and i dont plan on calling him, emailing him, or talking to him in any way til next thursday so that i can remind him to pick me up from the airport.  no matter how i feel, i paid $140 for a plane ticket, and i have to go.  the problem with this is that wednesday is his birthday.  i have to call.  it would be totally rude if i didnt.  so pretty much thats the andrew update.  there probably wont be too many more andrew updates.  ahh, so sad.

im at home right now.  staring at my pile of books listening to dashboard.  god i love their cd.  i never turn it off.  i also love the new sheryl crow song: first cut is the deepest.  check it out.  its amazing.  i found out that it is a remake, originally by cat stevens who is awesome, so im going to try and find his version.  

i wanted to do a shout out to ray.  he is so awesome.  he called me last night after my test to see how i did.  i was just lying in bed in the dark mourning.  i had just finished watching felicity.  man i love her.  she is just so beautiful.  anyway...ray....he is awesome.  thank god for good friends.

also, shout out to ben and jaclyn.  i didnt see them for a week or something and i found myself totally missing them.  i just love you ben!  i love your updates and seeing you walking around and how you react to situations.  dont ever stop being who you are.  jaclyn...i loved seeing you in the study lounge wednesday night.  i totally miss you.  i wish you were on my floor.  you need to come up more and i need to go down more.  also, christine...i love your updates.  probably i like them the best.  i just totally think you are so smart and intellectual and i love the things that interest you enough to talk about them on lj.  even though we dont talk so much, i think you are awesome. 

so, im on the last song of the dashboard cd (yeah, i dont know what its called cuz i just listen to the cd over and over without checking).  i should end this entry and open my o-chem book.  god i love this song: we are we are invisable.  i just love his voice and the melody and the drums.  god.  amazing.  take me with you.  alright.  im leaving.  stop typing!  ahhhhh chem book!  bed is calling me.  no, chem.  ok you have all heard enough.

i decided this entry will not be private.  if andrew reads this, he reads this.  he still has to see me friday."

"event","i have been sick for about a week and a half now, and not working out for a couple of reasons: 1-i cant breathe my nose is so clogged; 2-i was trying to get better.  but, the night before last i slept for 12 hours, and couldnt resist going to my favorite gym class, total conditioning.  man the teach worked us so hard.  i was so pumped last night after my class.  i didnt do any work, and went to bed after 1am.  this morning, i totally though jasmin locked herself out and 705am so i got up to bolt the door, and i couldnt go back to sleep.  so, i went to the gym.  i was going to take this kickboxing class that started at 8am, but when i got there i really wanted to lift.  so i went on an open elliptical (yes! there was one that no one was using!)  my average heart rate was 193, which is really high, my optimal heart rate is 130-170.  then i braved it in the weight room.  luckily, it was spirit squad work out day and the place was littered with females.  most of them were pretty tiny in all aspects, but a couple of them were ripped.  so now im laying in bed tired as shit.  i barely slept and then worked my ass off.  i have so much to do today too!  im leaving for san diego today for a mini-stanford reunion.  jaclyn and ben, well maybe just ben, though andrew was going to be there, in san diego.  damn, i wish.
so a little andrew update: i called him thursday when i was the sickest and he was primping to go to this annual stanford make out session.  he didnt call me until sunday night.  and we didnt really talk cuz he went to the store with his friend and pretty much just talked to his friend.  he had the nerve to tell me i needed to pay more attention to what he was saying so i knew if he was talking to me or his friend.  what a punk.  but, im vulnerable.  he called last night and we talked for about an hour.  man, i love talking to him.  i wish i was going to stanford this weekend.  i miss him so much!  i really want to know if he has been getting with other girls.  i mean, i dont really know that it would make a difference because we are so far apart and really just friends, i think, but still.  so, i think im gonna brave it and ask him after i leave the weekend im up there.  alright, i have a bunch of crap to get done before class."

"event","man i havent read through my friends list in a while.  i wish i could post more, but i have been so sick.  all i do is go to class and study and sleep.  ok, and think about andrew.  i didnt even talk to him that much last night.  my throat hurts really bad and i have a deep cough, so i couldnt really talk much last night.  the news of the day, well yesterday, is that i bought a plane ticket to go see him.  i will be going halloween weekend.  hopefully there will be some party going on.  last year halloween really blew because it was on a thursday or something.  this year, cross my fingers, it should be fun.  at least i will be with andrew.

so right now i am sitting in a computer lab in young hall, basically my new home because everyone of my classes is in this building.  i worked on some homework that is due, oh, today.  i have tutoring at 12 and then lab at 2.  i am meeting with nik, my lab partner, to go over the homework/pre-lab that is due.  i really just want to be in bed sleeping.  i can barely keep my eyes open.  but, i have 10 minutes to kill so i figured i would post.

it seems like every day i come back from class i am complaining about something.  yesterday, i just had the overwhelming feeling that i did not want to work in the research lab that i am working in now.  compared to the summer, i am not interested in working with birds and finding sex differences in their neuronal development.  ok, im lying, i am interested in it.  but, i have to kill baby birds!  it is so sad.  so anyway, i woke up this morning and realized it isnt so bad.  i dont know why i get this rush of negative feelings every time i go through a change or i dont get what i want.  good thing they vanish in the morning.

the other thing that happened yesterday was i was practicing my over-achiever-love-of-science-ness trying to make my ls2 class have honors credit.  basically i have to research a scientific topic relating to the class and write an 8 page paper with 8 sources.  so im sure there are a hundred people that would not want to write an 8 page paper.  but i do.  so, i went to talk to the prof because i have to have my topic picked by tomorrow, and apparantly i cant do it unless i am in the honors program.  well fuck, i dont want to be in the honors program.  and i cant get in it in time anyway.  so whats wrong with me writing an 8 page paper for nothing?  i am not a premed i am not trying to kiss ass in order to get a letter of rec or even a good grade in the class.   i am merely a nerd that wants to learn more science.  forgive me.  there are a few people left in this institution that are really here to learn and not just to make money.  so i think im going to pick a topic tonight and email my professor and make him work with me on this paper for no reason other than i want him to help me learn about a new aspect of science and how to write about it.  im paying for it anyway right?  im gonna learn as much as a i can for my 2K im pumping into this place each quarter.

well, i got to get to tutoring."

"event","i havent updated in a while.  i went away to a science conference in new mexico last weekend.  it was a lot of fun and i was recruited for both graduate school and summer programs by harvard, mit, yale, ucsd, los alamos national laboratories, and i think that is it.  i learned so much and i cant wait to go to the next one.  i really like doing science.  being there also made me realize that i would rather be with a guy who was really smart in a subject that isnt the same as mine.  ooh, like andrew.  man, i really like him.  i have been sort of stressed out about this boy because i like him so much and i dont know if he likes me that much.  i also dont know what to do about this whole long distance relationship thing.  i mean, most of them dont work, and im spending so much time thinking about him all day and then cross my fingers, talking to him on the phone (which i would like to do more).  but, i dont think that is going to stop me from liking him.  tonight he talked about me coming up for his formal with his fraternity, which would be totally awesome.  i really like getting all decked up like for prom.  but, who would do my hair!  ahh!  theresa would definitely not follow me there.  oh well, i would figure something out.  anyway, im actually about to go study.  amazing.  most of you who know my gpa and all the science shit i do must think that i study all of the time, but you are so wrong.  it takes a lot of effort and focus for me to study.  but, i am quite behind in my classes, so i need to get on the ball.  organic chemistry and bio here i come."

"event","i didnt get crystals.  something as easy as not getting crystals in stupid chem 30al puts me in this super depressed mood.  it is like there is one little thing in every event in my life that makes my mind wander and doubt things and today all of those little things jumped on my back at once.  so, here goes my lameness.  i know all of these things are trivial, but thats how i work.

im going to this science conference.  i should be extremely excited because not everyone gets to go and i actually have some kind of science to present which means i know how to do science and i had a productive summer.  but, i am missing class for it.  i just started class.  i dont even know when all of my tests are, or how it will affect me to miss class, or any of the things that you know about a class after you have been going for a few weeks.  on top of that, i have to miss chem lab, something that i will have to make up.  and as you already know, i didnt get crystals, which means the next part of the lab, the part i am missing, is going to be quite difficult to complete.  at least i think it will.

then, there is this whole issue with my ucla research lab.  i didnt have such a great experience when i was there last quarter and some lies were told about me by my stupid ass post-doc.  so now i feel uncomfortable in there not only because my p.i. perhaps may think i am a slacker or that there is someone in there that doesnt like me, but because i dont want to do that kind of research anymore.  i really want to find a structural biology lab to work in.  i really just want to move to stanford and have no friends and work in the lab there.  well, i would know andrew.  that would be nice.  but who knows how long that would last.  not that i dont want it to last.  back to the subject at hand, i loved my lab this summer.  doug is amazing.  i wish i could just stay there.  ill take classes there.  i dont know where the money would come from, but i could manage.  also, i dont even have that much time to work in lab with this stupid schedule that i have now.  i did such a horrible job with scheduling this quarter.

on top of this i am dealing with andrew.  i really like him but he is so far away and i dont know how much he likes me.  god, i am being such a pussy ass girl about this.  i should just make this a non-issue.  i want to go home, but who knows when i can do that.  the weekend i want to go my parents may not even be home.  my room is a mess.  i am eating way too much and really bad food at that.  okay, so i ate salad at lunch and im on my way to the gym.  but, i ate a burrito that was so disgusting at 1am and then went to bed at 230.  okay, whatever.  im sick of bitching.  i shouldnt bitch.  i have andrew to thank for that."

"event","there are people in my life that i do not get to see very often, but i value their friendship enormously.  for example, ardeshir.  i have known him since my sophomore year in high school.  we were the best of buddies.  shared a lot of emotional stories, who we liked, who we didnt like, what was going on with family, everything.  we were so close.  eventually a couple of events lead us to getting together.  we dated just over a year until i went to college and he broke it off.  i think it was better for the both of us even though we still loved each other.  he became his own person and i got to enjoy college without having to keep up with a long distance relationship.  so in the process, we started talking a lot less.  obviously, we were in a very serious relationship that just got broken off.  but, i really wish that we could be better friends now.  i was talking to him the other day online and he somewhat admitted his reluctance to talk to me about stuff.  i kind of understand because it may be weird talking about things to me about other girls or whatever.  i dont really know actually.  but i am kind of sad that we cant sit on the phone for hours like we used to and that i dont really know who he is anymore.  it isnt like i want to date him anymore or anything, or steal him away from all of his friends from san diego, but i just want to be a closer friend than i am.  i mean i spent 3 years of my life telling him every intimate detail about my life.  he knows me better than anyone else.  he knows my darkest secret that no one else will ever know.  dont even try and ask what it is.  i wont tell you.  it has nothing to do with you, i just choose to never reveal the stupidest thing that i have ever done in my life to this day.  so, anyway, i really wish that i could hear more about ardeshir's life.  that's all.  i need to talk about something else, in a new entry."

so what the hell is this you ask?  i dont know either.  i am just somewhat frustrated that i do not know what the heck andrew and i are and i am too afraid to ask him.  (andrew if you are reading this, im too afraid to ask you).  i mean obviously he somewhat likes me if he will fly down to see me and sleep in the same bed as me for two nights.  i think i am being male in that i cannot pick up on subtle hints that are sent in my direction.  i enjoy bluntness and it may be the only thing that will satisfy my continuously taskless mind."

"event","last night andrew and i went to see once upon a time in mexico.  while waiting for it to start, he was telling me how he just washed his shoes and they ended up whiter than they were when he bought them.  he felt like running in the dirt or something to make them wearable agin.  i think that is totally how moving back into the dorms is.  last year when we moved in we were wearing bright white new sneakers and were so excited to show them off.  we would walk up and down the halls and stay out of our rooms and meet people.  soon the floor wasnt so new and unfamiliar anymore, and it was similar to when new sneakers stop looking new we barely even remembered that we even had new shoes.  life became so normal again.  still exciting, but we were used to the people on the floor and our school schedule and who we would eat with and every other little aspect about dorming.  but now, moving back to the dorms, it is like we washed those same shoes and are trying to wear them, but they just dont look or feel the same.  we are so used to seeing them all dirty and worn that now it is almost uncomfortable to wear them, and we dont really want to put the time into making them look like they did before.  that is how i feel now: i dont really want to go out and meet new people because i just want dorming to be how it was last year.  eventually, i will get used to it, and i will attain a new normality, but until then, my shoes will reflect an extraordinarily bright white.

so, i hope that jaclyn and be...i hope you guys will stop feeling lonely and realize that in a couple of weeks things will get to be more like they were last year.  i miss how things were, but they will never be like that again.  so, suck it up and learn to like the people on your floor now.  hopefully these people wont lock you out of the bathroom while you are showering."

"event","so today i was talking to a counselor lady in my research program and she thought i was crazy for taking the classes that i was taking, and doing research.  little does she know that im also going to be an officer for the golf club, give campus tours, and possibly get involved with the student alumni association.  i went to my research lab this morning for a lab meeting...getting back into the swing of things.  oh how i would love to just do research all day.  but, that day will come soon enough.  for now im stuck learning all of the stuff that will allow me to do nothing but research.  im actually sitting in the biomed library supposedly preparing for this meeting that i will be forced to deal with in a mere 4 hours explaining what i did this summer and confronting my fears of telling my professor that i dont want to work with jun.  man, that guy really bothers me.  he totally hates me for god knows what reason and he makes working in the lab miserable.  why cant my stanford lab move to ucla?  oh, cuz ucla isnt as good, i forgot.

anyway, i was really happy that jaclyn and ben came to my room yesterday to play nintendo.  i miss the days.  AND!!!!  charlotte emailed me today and i am so excited.  she is doing awesome in ghana.  even though she has dysentery.  i miss her.  but, ill just have to get over it.  so, jaclyn and ben: come play nintendo more!  and tonight is the night, you MAY meet andrew.  hopefully he gets here fine having to take the shuttle and all.  after today you may never want to read my andrew entries again.  we will see.

i should get some work done."

"event","so i think i left off on andrew and i playing golf.  i guess i went down to his room more to hang out and ate with him at dinner and whatever else there is to do around the dorm without planning.  then it came down to my last week, which happened to be his finals week.  i had to do a poster and he had to study for a final.  we both were studying together, and i was so tired.  i hadnt even started my poster that was due in about 12 hours and i hadnt even started.  it was 2am.  so he so cutely carried my bad upstairs.  but, my good buddy rob was leaving that day and so i was saying bye to him.  andrew left to study.  i tried to sleep around 3am but i was so worried that i wasnt going to get my poster done in time so i went back downstairs with my computer to work on it while andrew was studying.  around 5ish he was ready to go to bed and i had been done playing a game on his cell phone getting the high score.  i really didnt want to leave him so i stopped on his floor which has these catwalk things with weird balconies i guess you would call them.  we just stood there hugging for a while...then some really cute romantic kissing.  then we were waltzing!  man we are nerds.  but it was so cute with the moon above us and stuff.  eventually i made it up to my room and he tucked me in and that was the end of the evening.  it was 530 am.

i had to give a practice oral presentation that day at 1pm i think.  so i went to lab around 1130ish to work on the powerpoint.  i gave the presentation and then finally started my poster.  i wasnt finished til after 7pm.  man i dont know where i am going with this.  basically, i didnt get to see andrew very much.  then the day i left he had a final at 830am so we didnt really get to hang out much on the last night.  we did take a very cute picture though when took a very short study break.  in the morning he came into my room (they have regular locks so you can leave it unlocked and peeps can just walk in) to say goodbye.  it was really weird because it didnt really feel like a goodbye.  he gave me a very cute kiss and then just walked out to go take his final.

so i flew home that day.  my daddy picked me up and we went to sushi.  i didnt call him that night?  at least i dont think i did.  the next night i for sure called him.  the following night we talked online.  then i just waited for him to call me.  i didnt know if i was being obsessive calling him so much.  yeah, a whole 2 times and i was worried.  but, it was one of those little tests to see if someone thinks about you enough to call you, ya know?  so, obviously he did call.  i started housesitting and we talked almost every night.  he would call after i had been sleeping for about 2 hours.  i would wake up and talk to him for a couple hours then go back to sleep.  the night before he went to italy with his parents we talked for 7 1/2 hours.  i dont remember what about.  i think it was so long because neither one of us wanted to stop talking and recognize that we couldnt talk for over 2 weeks.  but they passed fine and i got very cute postcards and emails updating me about his trip.

so now here i am in sproul.  he called today.  i was so excited i was bouncing up and down.  people would walk by my room and give me the strangest looks wondering why i was acting so weird.  we talked for quite a while.  it was really nice to hear his voice again.  we havent talked in a few days or so.  im not really sure.  i am REALLY excited that he is coming.  and i really want to come visit him, but with all these science conferences that i am going to, i dont know if will be able to.  im sad cuz he is leaving really early sunday morning.  but, ill take what i can get."

"event","so, my roommate showed up yesterday.  i was so excited.  she made her bed and put all of her stuff in place.  now the room feels complete.  we hung out in the room, hamadi stopped by and we chatted.  he is so jealous of our room.  last year, the four of us wanted to live near each other.  hamadi picked sproul.  derek picked sproul.  jazz and i still wanted to live in dykstra in the beginning, and then we finally came around.  so, i had an early sign-up time and i got jazz and i a room on the top floor of sproul.  when it was time for the boys to sign up, every male double in sproul was taken.  so, now they are stuck in dykstra HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!  anyway, i talked to some people from my floor again yesterday.  2 persian guys.  woah, history.  

im on my way to campus.  a fun-filled day with my roomie jazz.  bowling with derek and hamadi.  come see my new lara croft poster!

"event","so, its my second full day at school.  im in my new room, alone.  my roommate just dropped her stuff off yesterday and left.  hopefully she will be back soon.  its weird being in the room alone.  i was excited about it yesterday, but not anymore cuz my roommate isnt here to share the excitement with me.  i hope that she isnt trying to stay at home as long as possible because she is hesitant about being my roommate.  i moved all the stuff in the room around so hopefully she doesnt get upset.  

yesterday was a fun day.  i hung out with ben pretty much all day and we had a lot of fun.  i went to the bad religion concert and even though i dont really know all of their songs, i had a really good time.  i have been into rock and pop punk a lot more lately.  i went to bed pretty early at 1130.  i was so tired though.  i havent been working out lately and that makes me tired.  i tried to go this morning but never got around to it.  maybe tonight. 

there is nothing to do here at school.  well, there is, but it feels like there isnt anything to do.  i actually have a bunch of crap to do but i dont want to do it.  i feel like i have no friends here.  no one on my floor is that social.  its weird.  im used to knowing everyone.  jaclyn and ben and christine have their own stuff to do and we are all tired and just bore each other.  then there is derek, who i want nothing to do with.  but i want my lara croft poster.  so i have to talk to him once.  hopefully im in a better mood before andrew comes.

i have to go to a floor meeting."

"event","so, as you know i went to stanford this summer.  of course, there were boys.  one in particular is named andrew.  andrew lived on the second floor of the building that i was in (i was on the third).  he is going to be a fourth year at stanford majoring in computer science and minoring in economics i think?  he definitely doesnt look like a cs major.  he is romanian, born in romania, currently living in seattle.

so, i think the first time i had a conversation with this boy was at lunch one day with my chicas veronica and lia.  we were talking to a high school senior who was trying to decide between stanford, ucla and harvard (where ugh, hmm, veronica pretends to go to).  so he was one of the first people there to carry a conversation and act like he uses the brain that god gave him.  so veronica and i left to bike back to lab and lia runs out and says ""who is that boy"" with this cute little smirk on her face that showed how interested she was in this new boy, who she thought was the only cute boy there at the time.  and he is pretty cute.

so, i dont really remember the order of events too well, so i will give it my best shot.  i named him man-crush, more specifically, lia's mancrush.  i would be riding back to lab after seeing him at lunch and see lia and get all excited to tell her that he was there.  we talked about her having this crush on him a lot.  we tried to take her downstairs to talk to him as often as she would let us.  one night he was having a party and was bringing stuff upstairs from his roommate's truck right as a group of us were coming back from somewhere and i just wanted to say hi and i got drawn into a longer conversation with him.  another morning he came downstairs into the dining area as i was leaving and he gave me this big hug.  right in front of lia and a lot of other people from the program.  i didnt hug him back.  that was lia's mancrush.  at this party he threw i went up and danced with him for about point two five seconds.  i danced longer with lia.  anyway, at this point he was still lia's.

then, i come back from lab one day and there is a note on my door that says ""driving range? 4pm.""  it was 6pm when i got it.  so, i went down to his room and wrote ""driving range? 6pm"" on his white board.  i saw him at dinner and we planned on going.  he drove and bought the golf balls.  then in the car on the way i thought was back to the dorm, he says ""i didnt get dessert.  did you want to get some ice cream?""  and of course, me who is always concerned about being fat didnt really want ice cream, but i wanted to hang out with him, so i went and had ice cream.  he paid.  so, back at the dorm, we have this running joke about going on dates.  cuz my girls veronica and lia try to claim that when they hang out with their guy friends that it isnt really a date.  so obviously they are going to call this a date cuz it was just the two of us and he paid.  BUT, he was wearing his workout clothes.  who goes on a date in their workout clothes?  i agree though, it was a date.

i wanted to play the stanford course.  but it is way too expensive to play if you arent a student.  so we made this whole plan for me to use another girl's id card.  but, they caught me and took the card.  andrew paid the 40 bucks for me to play.  i felt like shit for getting caught, but i got over it.  i loved the course.  i wanted to play again, but there was no time.  anyway, afterwards we went to dinner at a joint named oasis.  it was a bar for people over 21 which i was not.  but, they didnt even check so i was fine.  he asked if i wanted pizza.  ha, end of story.  lia, you know my reaction to that.  so, he bought the pizza that we shared.  once again, another date and another night of convo with veronica and lia.  i really love those gals.  there arent many girls that i really have a good friendship with, but they are two of them.  along with jaclyn and somewhat jasmin.  i think by the end of the year jazz and i will be closer to like me and jaclyn.  i hope.  or it will be more like me and my friend katie.  anyway....andrew. right.
(i love jason mraz.)

so, im sorry, but i will have to finish this story later.  im listening to one of my fav mraz songs right now, after an afternoon.  i have never heard a song that better resembles the physical feeling of being in love.  as a person who loves analyzing literature and writing powerfully, i just cant get over how well this song is love.  love is one of those emotions that is indescribable.  the feelings that your heart goes through and your stomach and the way your body quivers upon the touch or breath of your significant other, is impossible to explain through words, music, art, anything.  but, every once in a while, someone catches a big chunk of that feeling.  and this song does it for me.  so now im on the phone with andrew and the beauty has floated away.  ill be back tomorrow."

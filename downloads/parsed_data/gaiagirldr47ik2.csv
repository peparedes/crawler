I live in a cave and write articles about how to get bouncy hair and what to do if your teenager has sex (boot them to the curb, I say!).  I don't see sunshine, I don't exercise, and I don't get out of my jammies most days (well, today I did...took a shower too!).  I occasionally get massage or Reiki clients, but that's about it.  So much for the ""freedom"" of self-employment!  Sumpthin's gotta give here, me thinks.  The secretary spread is verging on really stupid.

So to mix things up and make a little more money, I applied to teach a class for the University of CA, Berkeley's casual extension program (Like Open U, but it's on line).  I designed the class today and submitted it.  It's called ""Neo-Paganism and Witchcraft in the United States: an Overview.  It's very detailed about the historical progression of the Craft (for non-magickal folk, though, so it's still survey stuff)and other forms of Neo-Paganism since the 1950's revival.  The pay is mediocre, but still pretty good if I get a few students.  I think it'll be good for the resume, too.  Then maybe I can get off this damn chair once in a while! Wish me luck!"

I've done it.  I've found perhaps the only therapist on the planet with whom I can connect.  Thrilled beyond words, I am.  It's very exciting to take this little odyssey into my personal underworld.  Never thought I'd hear myself say that.  

I'm also very happy to be performing a dedication tomorrow. I look forward to witnessing this particular student's adventure with the Craft and with B*.  Very enjoyable stuff.

Thanks very much to all of you for responding to my last post.  Once one gets over the shock, the meat hook isn't that painful and the underworld offers a nice change of scenery.  Your support helps."

A friendly note to all you thirds out there:  You said that 2nd degree was like Neophyte on crack, but I didn't think you actually MEANT it.  You had such a resigned, loving smile on your face.  You made it sound like it wasn't going to hurt.  Much.  Here's what you should have done:  Grab my arm, haul me to the perimeter of the chaos and look me straight in the eye.  You should have said, ""You don't want to go in there.  No, you REALLY don't want to go in there!""  But you didn't.  No.  You just said, ""Well, it's like Neophyte on crack.""  But Neophyte didn't strip me of all that I knew to be true and then yank me by the neck out of my womb-like slumber into the bowels of my greatest fears, in front of a big floor to ceiling mirror.  Nope. 

So I had a reading.  A brutal, real, tough love reading.  I have since learned that I'm getting called on my shit.  And if I refuse, It's gonna hurt.  A lot.  I'll spare you the gory details, but suffice it to say that I was gently reminded that if I don't show myself to those who love me, they can't have real relationships with me.  And I was gently reminded that I'm not o.k., and that I better get my ass into therapy.  Because the alternative is, well, not attractive. Grief counseling.  Family of origin issues.  Abuse issues.  Abandonment.  Trust.  Security.  

So I actually found a pagan friendly psychotherapist.  Thank you, Universe.  And I'm gonna go.  And I'm gonna journal.  And I'm gonna take on the monster in the closet.  Gotta go set up my grief altar, as per my instructions.  Anybody got a nose plug?"

But now I just think it's hysterical.  Seriously.  Like, when my better paying gigs dry up periodically, and I find myself writing $6 blog posts and then I have to chase after these people to get them to pay me...""Dude, where's my six bucks, man?  I'm serious, man.  I need my six bucks.""  Uh huh.

So I have, like, $300 worth of work just floating around in the stratosphere, and I'm literally standing next to the mailbox every day at 3:00 to see if I got a check.  Oh, don't get me wrong, I have some good paying gigs, and it's still fun to get hired to write, but lordy, I never thought it'd be this stupid.  

I'm learning a lot though.  I'm getting much better at social media because some of my writing is on-line.  And I'm learning that there are some very interesting companies out there.  For instance, I'm writing for Vegan Mainstream, which is--get this, a vegan business to business marketing service.  Seemed a little over-specialized to me, but hey...I don't judge.  And as part of being a writer is lying your ass off anyway, hell...I can be vegan.  Why not?  So I just finished ""Top 10 Ways to Create Brand Recognition for your Vegan Products.""  Yup.  Completely different from creating brand recognition for hamburgers.  I mean it.

Kinda fun, I'm getting an article published in the new ""Witches & Pagans"" mag, the love child of newWitch and Pangaia.  Two, actually.  One's a book review and the other is about empowering a garden gargoyle.  You know...to babysit the lettuces.  Don't laugh.  Keeps the bunnies away, fo sho.  

So that's what's going on over here.  If you care to look, http://www.naturalfoodlist.com/articles/?p=50  And if you care to ""Digg"" me, that'd be awesome, too!!"

"event","I've begun making home made kefir and kombucha fermented tea, and I have some lovely kefir grains and a kombucha ""mushroom"" (scoby) to share with Mpls./St. Paul folks who are interested.  Both of these drinks are very expensive if you buy them at the store and cost next to nothing to make at home.

Kefir is a liquid probiotic (made with dairy or soy milk) that is easy to create on your kitchen counter.  Drinking it for 1 week has almost completely resolved my chronic digestive complaints.  Other benefits of drinking kefir include lowering bad cholesterol, ameliorating lactose intolerance, diminishing belly fat, boosting immunity, clearing skin, and more.  The grains grow and in a week, you'll be giving them away, too!

Kombucha is a fermented tea that you make at home.  It takes about 7-10 days to complete and it tastes tart.  It supports liver function, detoxes you, helps with weight loss, and generally makes you a much happier camper. Good for fasting. 

So, let me know if you're interested in some free starters."

So my friend Richard likes to go to the Cardinal Bar in Mpls. (very upscale) and play bingo  on Wednesdays.  He occasionally encourages me to come along.  So I did, last night.  I don't know how many of you play bingo, but I'm a noob, not being much for gambling.  I generally hold the opinion that gambling is roughly akin to standing over the toilet and flushing dollar bills.  Last night, I proved myself right.  Except it was more like flushing dollar bills while hitting myself in the head with a hammer.  While drinking beer.

You see, you have to get a certain pattern to win each game.  Some games require straight lines, or just diagonal lines, or clusters of numbers.  Each game, I not only lost, but I got the exact pattern that would have won on the last game, but not the current one.  Yeah.  Every. Damn. Time. I'm not even going to sit and think about the energetic message there.  Nope."

I don't check in here very often.  I'm not as electronically engaged as some.  I always love reading my friends' journals and often feel a little remiss in my duties when I see the connection that some of you maintain via the internet.  Still...I'm not an electronic girl, except when I can help it.

My sister's wedding in Sacramento was gorgeous.  I worked from the moment I got there until the moment I left, as did we all, but we pulled it off in stunning style.  Dad even walked Sara down the aisle and had a first dance with her (update for those who don't know...Sara is a lesbian who married outside her race, and dad is, well, a Republican (old school)).  I never thought I'd see the day!  The happy couple honeymooned on a cruise to Mexico, and big sis came home to her wonderful family...and slept.

It's interesting that I have more balls in the air than usual, and yet I'm beginning to feel more serene than usual.  There are a lot of pressures on our household right now.  Financial (decreasing income and the pressure to reorganize), familial (old things coming out as they should, adolescence, merging families), and spiritual (a welcome increase in responsibility, elevation, new horizons on the internal frontier), and yet, I got the craziest feeling two days ago.

It's all going to be fine.

That's really new.  Serenity amidst chaos.  I'd say something Zen now, but I'm too busy being O.K."

As my sister is a webmistress (among other things), and I'm a professional writer (among other things), we decided that it would be pretty darn dumb not to launch a website of our own and just see where it takes us.  So, we put our heads together and came up with http://debtfreewedding.com.

We thought it was a pretty good time for such a subject, and it's also a perennially popular search subject.  Anywhoo, we have optimistic hopes for the durned thing, and if you would like to check it out, that'd be mighty fine.  Feedback is also welcomed.  There are only about 20 articles on it right now, with many, many more coming, including a forum and (it is hoped) an eventual barter section.

Yeah, I was feeling a little down.  Not enough work, not seeing the honey enough, sick with a bug, and then the kid got sick.  I was dragging myself around, forcing myself to do laundry, write, see clients occasionally.  Just feeling anti-social, you know?

Fast-forward to this evening.  I saw a regular client who is always generous with tips and a really nice, upstanding person.  He told me how, after the surgery he had a while ago, he developed a heart blockage and went in to have some tests.  I was treating him for the post-op recovery, so I knew he was having difficulties.  Well, he revealed to me that, after he saw me the last time, his heart blockage just disappeared.  Vanished.  Poof.  Doctors scratched their heads and said, ""Oh, well.  It's gone.""  

I said, ""Wow, that's great!  Congratulations.""  

He handed me an envelope and smiled.  Within the envelope was a card with a note stating that he wished to give me the tuition for an accredited herbalism course that I wanted to take, because of all that I do for him.  I had mentioned to him in passing that I'd found a two year course that will certify me as a professional herbalist.  It's one of the only courses that's recognized by the American Herbalist Guild.  He gave me the whole thing.  All of it.  I almost passed out.

I don't know whether to shit or wind my watch.

O.K., so if that's not strange enough, add this to the soup:  Earlier today, I was bopping around on Craigslist looking for writing gigs.  I found this post that just said, ""Karma.""  I was bored, so I clicked it, and it was one of those cheesy chain-lettery things that we all hate.  It said something to the effect of, "" If you post this in another city, you will have your mind blown almost immediately by incredible good luck.""  I decided, since it was free, to post it in Seattle."

So I was watching TV, and I saw a story on this woman who started blogging about her motherhood experiences, and now she makes $40,000.00 per month from advertisers on her site.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  Her husband quit his job, and now they are basically rich for a living.  So then I said to my sister, ""Hey, I write for a living and you make websites for a living.  What say we combine our talents and see if we can rustle up some affiliate income?""  She liked it.  We're gonna try it.  Because, man, I could live on HALF that!!  You know?  Heck, if it generated a thousand a month and we split it, it would still be cool, right?

Since Sara is in the middle of planning her wedding, we decided to make wedding issues the focus of the blog.  There's an unending amount of material to write about, and even though the market is pretty saturated, we think we have a decent twist on it.  Hey, initial investment:  70 bucks and some secretary spread.  If it doesn't generate much, then so what...I gotta try something here, because I'm broke."

I thought at first that I would need a hysterectomy at minimum, and it ended up being a short (but painful) office procedure, followed by a few days of anxiety while I awaited my results.  Turns out, I'm healthy, for the most part, but wasn't in menopause, as I initially thought.  I had a tumor.  A really big one. But benign, Goddess bless.

O.K., so life isn't really that bad.  I am, however, getting sick of waiting for weeks for my freaking employers to pay me.  Such is the life of a free lancer.  

The Catholic priest with whom I'm attempting to collaborate stays just unreachable until I'm ready to write him off, when he takes the stage with annoying panache and explains why he couldn't return my calls.  Then he wins my heart with his Captain Do Good routine. I'm up, I'm down, I'm sideways, I'm pissed.

I have applied for every writing job in the free world.  I have advertised for massage and Reiki.  I did get one call from a gentleman who apparently thought I offered ""colon therapy.""

But after I saw the above picture, all was right with the world.  Who doesn't want to abuse a poor tree into mutilating itself for your sitting pleasure?  Not I.

Congrats to my dear friends who recently received spiritual elevations.  At least that is way cool and really uplifting!!"

Wish me luck.  As my retail jewelry contract is winding down, I need to find another couple of writing gigs, ASAP.  Freelance work is both fabulous and stressful.  I just applied to a gig that will be on-going, and hope that it will pan out.  It's for a travel site that wants lots of articles about your home city, and unlike most such sites, this one requires a degree and published clips, so it pays really well.  Cross your fingers for me!  Anybody need a ghost writer????"

Some times I just want to flaunt it to the world. I need a festival.  And no, I can't fit in FSG this year.  I just need some pointy-hatted people to sing with, dance with, and leap some fires.  I know it will come."

"event","Hello, everybody.

I'd like to apologize to people for not getting back on time, be it e mails, phone calls, psychic memos, or messages sent by carrier pigeon.  I'm really working hard, and for some reason (working on my 2nd?), my life is in fast-forward.  You know who you are, and I still love you.

In the past 8 weeks, I have 1) accidentally become the U.S. director of a non-profit, 2) contracted with, among others, a jewelry distributor to write various and sundry press releases, web copy, look-book text, and other junk, at a very nice hourly rate, 3) been raising my lovely and attention-intensive teenager, 4) supported my husband through a particularly rough realization that he needs permanent restrictions at work, due to repetitive and ridiculous strains on his body, 5) continued to work on massage/Reiki clients.

My surreal foray into another non-profit includes collaborating with a young, fiery Catholic priest, of all things.  Yeah, I know.  He inherited this 100+ year old order from a dying (90 year old) priest who based the global organization in Wales.  We're working on getting it incorporated in Minnesota now.  Basically, Legion of Mercy (archaic because of the age and origin) has been re-directed by the newly appointed Father Chris to help women in poverty stricken areas avert sexual exploitation and violence.  Father Chris is a ball of love, and he goes into Juarez, Mexico to support, assist, and sometimes hear the confessions of women on the streets, in the brothels, and in the mob-run ""clubs"" that abound there.  700+ women are murdered there every year.  Horrible.  Money is small, but the work is meaningful. And it will get bigger.  He knows I'm a witch, and (I was surprised) thinks I'm perfect for the job, and is very supportive.  Who'd a thunk?  If you're morbidly curious, see http://www.legionofmercy.org

Chuck is working with a pain clinic now, to determine his restrictions, because he has, among other things, tendonitis in knees and elbows, bulging discs, frayed rotator cuffs, and arthritis.  He's a trooper.  Taija is also going to a pain clinic, for chronic neck and shoulder issues, which we suspect might ultimately (along with other symptoms) point to fibromyalgia.

We had both cars die in one week's time, and had to pull money out of our ***holes, to the tune of 500.  It could have been worse.  Our old mechanic, bless him, got us a body control module for $175 instead of $700.  May the Gods smile upon him and his family.

So that's us, in a nutshell.  Hopefully, I'll be able to turn my attention to my larger community, soon. I'm looking forward to jumping back in with both feet."

So, I just realized that I write about my kid a lot in here.  Sorry if you find that obnoxious.  But far from my usual gushing, I think this is of interest to some of you other parents out there.

I just found the coolest high school on the planet.  It's a charter school that's right down the street from us, but has kids from all over.  It's called Northwest Passage High School.  It's a 3 building campus where students from grades 9-12 build their own curriculum and create their own project-based learning.  They are fully accredited, of course, but do not give tests, except for mandatory state tests.  The kids propose their projects to a panel of advisors, work independently (except for math), and then present their finished projects, like arguing a thesis.  They also teach life skills, require juniors and seniors to be employed, and take the kids on local, national, and international trips for volunteering and educational purposes.  And the parents DO NOT PAY for the trips!  The only fees are very reduced rates for international excursions.

The students have gone to England, the North Shore, Washington D.C., and lots of other places.  They take trips in the Summer and during the school year.  The kids work at their own pace and can also take college courses if they qualify (I think most schools offer that now).  

Taija is very excited about attending, as the internet high school thing, while good for her academically, has her going stir-crazy.  We're gonna start after the holidays.  If any of you are interested in this for your kids, please visit their website below.  We took a tour today, and it's about as unconventional as it gets!

"event","So, just in case somebody didn't understand, the previous entry that has our family depicted as dancing elves was my daughter's sick idea.  Twisted, that child.  And yes, she did it to horrify.

I'm much happier than I was in days past because, although I'm still in the hole, I have gotten work recently, and made $160 today.  Yay!  

I'm also happy because my child has chosen to use her talents for the greater good, and will donate some art for a fundraiser that's being held by Jungle Red Salon/Spa to benefit homeless youth.  They're having an auction to sell the art, and Taija will design a 9 photograph series depicting scenes from Alice in Wonderland.  She has cast the roles, done the story board, engaged the photographer, and everything.  We will have to spend a little for costumes (bummer...and we can't really afford it...), but I believe that this experience is very valuable for her, so I'm gonna let her do it.  The benefit is specifically for art by youth under 25, so if any of your kids want to join in, I encourage it.  The deadline is November 30 and the benefit is December 13 at 7 pm at the spa.  Food, auction, fun, etc.

Today, I got up, took a bath, changed the sheets on the bed, made a mental note of all of the chores I've been neglecting, and sat down with a list of projects to be done.  I haven't done that in quite a while.  I feel like I've come out of a coma.

I'm suddenly excited about my writing assignments (I have a few.  Even in depression, I apparently remember to query editors.  Thank you, Auto-Pilot!), feeling like I can take clients, and even want to plan for the holiday!

I've been writing a column for a picnic retailer on antique recipes, so I think I'll have to make some old-fashioned wassail this year.  Hey, there is a most excellent website for all serious foodies!  Here's the link: http://www.foodtimeline.org/

Transformation is an amazing process.  I mean, I was positively unaware that I was transforming, and yet it was happening anyway.

I have been so dark lately.  I mean, really dark.  Depressed, unfocused, less than productive, rebellious like a teenager.  Not my best self.  The recent shock that I experienced from the rejection by my father seems to have kick started something good.  It's shamanic in a way.  I felt as though the Gods stuck a hand into my gut and pulled out my inner, scared little kid, holding her up to my adult self.  Then, they looked me squarely in the eye and said, ""Do something with this, already.""  

I seem to have been able to do just that...and I'm feeling strangely whole now.  Like I can't be hurt in that way any more.  Serene, grown up, secure.  Absolutely fascinating how a sucker punch to the stomach can be so helpful..."

I just cried really, really hard.  I haven't cried that hard since my mom died.  I did it in front of my kid, no less.  I tried not to do it, but I couldn't stop.  My father called and basically told me that I'm not welcome at Thanksgiving.  No reason, other than that his wife's family will be there, and we can't apparently fit into his 4500 square foot mansion.  The real reason is the same as always.  His wife makes him choose her ""people"" (who cannot, of course, be mixed with our people) over his children.  And he lets her.  Yes, it's that crazy over there.  The woman can't suffer our presence twice per year, but has condescended to invite us over on Saturday December 6 to celebrate my father's and brother's birthdays.  Last year I was told not to come on Christmas eve, and when I balked, my dad entertained us, but my step-mother was conspicuously absent.  Why?  Because we had overridden her ruling that we were not to come.  The woman makes me nauseous.

Now, we were going to host Thanksgiving for our grown kids and their peeps anyway.  But the point is that I'm not welcome in my father's house.  My father, the multi-millionaire.  My daughter, bless her, made the sober observation that we are far richer than he is.  We are going to take the change jar and buy a turkey with it, invite the kids to bring a dish or two, and cram everybody into our tiny townhouse.  And you know what?  Taija is right.  I, with my rusted jalopy, my over-drawn bank account, and my change jar am far richer than my father.  I'm still very sad, however, because I just realized that I'm an orphan.  My mom had the courtesy to actually die before she orphaned me, but my father chose to do it in a much more painful way.  He has died to me without leaving."

"event","Whoa.  It's already after midnight.  I should go to bed.  Life is so hectic now.  Fun, but hectic.

So, our director sent me a link to the work previously done by Taija's ""leading man.""  It's...well, lo-budge.  I was disappointed, but I guess I also expected it.  Hey, at least he's made movies before.  Taija was relieved that he wasn't attractive to her.  She said that this would make it much easier to ""act"" attracted to him.  I guess I get that.

I realized that ""Dying Midwestern"" wasn't as bad as I thought when we brought home some dark, gothic, mock-horror for Taija to study.  As Hollywood Video couldn't find their copy of ""Blair Witch,"" (which neither of us has seen...I know...), we checked out ""Girl, Interrupted"" for a portrayal of mental derangement and also a lovely little number called, ""Goth.""  This FABULOUS film is done by such a small production company that it looks like it was shot with a hand-held purchased at Wal-Mart.  I highly recommend it for its comic attributes, none of which were intentional.  The hilarity is compounded by the inclusion of a ""special features"" section on the disc, which shows the film's writer/director (in someone's basement), comparing this...film to ""Requiem for a Dream.""

Anyway, the film that Taija's leading man, Will Farley,was in is called ""Dying Midwestern,"" and he plays the bald ""criminal"" in the following trailer.  Brace yourself.  It's bad.

In other news, hubby is doing physical therapy again for his back.  I fear surgery is looming in our future.  He's such a tough guy, and such a hard worker.  He just keeps plowing through.  But the pain is horrible, and he had to sit out at our nephew's wedding, unable to dance at all.  Any energy would be appreciated.

Another blessing for me...I have met a young grad student (my Reiki student) who is using Reiki in a small program to assist women who are on the street.  We did the happy dance when we realized that we can work together to create an awesome outreach and healing program using both of our skill sets and backgrounds.  Looking very forward to seeing what develops, there!

Blessings!"

"event","Hey everyone.  You've been warned.  I'm about to be incredibly tiresome and brag about my child.  Take your Dramamine.

My daughter has landed a part in a movie.  Let me qualify this by saying that it is an incredibly low-budget, ""B"" horror flick, but it's still work, and it's still a movie.

And it's stupid.  Really stupid.  However, she is beside herself with joy, and is so excited that she gyrates in place when she sits at the breakfast table.

Taija was supremely disappointed to learn that she wasn't going to get killed.  She really had her heart set on being disemboweled, but alas, it is illegal in Minnesota to film a murder scene involving a minor.  However, she is very happy that her part will get a lot of screen time.  What's her part, you ask?  She is cast as the under-age girlfriend of the leader of a prolific Satanic gang.  

Go ahead and laugh.  I'll wait.

Play ""Jeopardy"" waiting track....

O.K., so anyway, the part does NOT involve any love scenes, implied sex or skimpy clothing.  Which is why I agreed to let her do it.  The subject matter is a little dark, but my child is a little dark, and she really loves playing dark parts (child of Hecate?  Hmmmm....).

She gets scale pay for the minutes of screen time she gets after the final cut.  And get this.  I play a tiny part, too.  I am cast as her mother (that's a stretch...what's my motivation?), and I am going to be ""interviewed"" as the distraught mom who is dealing with her daughter being taken over by these horrible people.  How Fun!!  And I get paid, too!  

Anyway, there's a lot going on right now, but that's the biggest part of the story.  My business is doing a whole lot better, and that's a blessing.  I am working as a writer, a healer, a Reiki instructor (and apparently an actress....), and I love it."

That's hard to come by for a first foray with a magazine. My article, by the way, is called ""Pagan Business 101.""  It's kitchy and not extremely informative, but it's what they wanted.  You know...light-hearted, fluffy, that kind of thing.  So, I turn to my article and read through it.  There are a few errors, but nothing to speak of. So far, so good.  I'm all excited about the exposure and what it will do for my Reiki business, etc.  A brief happy moment...

I got to the end of my article, and, I'm sorry to say, several people at the sidewalk cafe witnessed me slamming my forehead into my steering wheel, shouting ""Really???REALLY????  No, REALLY?????!!!!"" 

Here's what it says, and I quote:  ""KRISTIN BARTON owns Gaia Transformations in name of city and state here.  Give her contact information here. She is a Reiki Master Teacher and free-lance writer who lives with her daughter Taija and her husband Chuck.""

Cue disappointing cartoon sound.

Anyway, it's on newsstands now, folks.  Get it while it's hot."

"event","The world is in turmoil...the election looms...children are homeless....And here I sit, totally absorbed in my own existence.  Proud?  No.  But I'm still absorbed here, in my own home.  

My child is doing better in school than ever.  She wants desperately to return to public school, even though she sees friends almost every day.  She wants to experience high school, and I can't blame her.  But in Internet High School, she is getting A's and B's.  In regular public school, despite a near-Mensa I.Q., she was failing.  What to do? My husband objects, but I'm gonna let her try public school again.  She says that now she is more mature.  Condition:  You fail, it's back to home school with the support of Minnesota Virtual High School.  Period.

I am still doing lots of massage/Reiki, and still teaching Reiki.  I have begun to rely more on my writing to make a living, though. The massage market in the Cities is too immature and sexually wounded for me to waste much more time.  I hand off the torch willingly. Reiki students still come, and I am blessed!

I have sold a lot of writing lately.  One of my gigs is with http://www.meefers.com, which is a GLBTQ friendly website out of Michigan, recently expanding to Minneapolis.  I am proud to write for them.  Go to their home page and click on Minneapolis.  You'll see my work there.

Also, I sold a 12 article package to a picnic retailer, this time on antique recipes.  I really love writing those articles.  They are not even work!  I'm a geek.

Unrelated:  Taija did a professional photo shoot.  The photographer and stylist were very impressed with her professionalism.  The 14 year old endured an 8.5 hour shoot.  She begged her parents to let her model professionally, and she came through like a trooper.  More photos at http://www.scottwtaylor.net 

Don't know how to create a link.  

Blessings, all. 

All in all, it's going o.k., but we need to generate more income, and I know we will.  Blessings to all of you,

Kristin

"event","Yes...it's been a long time since I've posted or read anything on LJ.  My life has been so full and busy that I just had to pare things down.  

A lot of stuff has changed for us in the last few months.  I have experienced a drop in income due, I assume, to the economy.  My services are the type that are the first to go when money gets tight for people.  I have made some money, of course, and have sold some articles to magazines and websites as well, but it's still very tight.  Chuck's job was eliminated some months ago, and while he was still working in a much lower capacity in terms of rate of pay, we suffered a huge blow.  He is, happily, making a better income now.  He still has a lot of pain, but he's a former Marine.  Hoorah, and all that.

We have agreed to allow our teen daughter to pursue, after 10 years of begging, a serious acting career.  She has formally studied for 3 years, but we have not allowed her to audition for any real work, believing that stage parents suck, and that her little butt belonged in school.  We have recently agreed to let her attend internet high school, study voice privately, and actually audition for real work.  She's very good at what she does, and we think that she'll likely be able to make a living at it.  She has to keep her grades up, of course, and really go for it.  Even if it doesn't pan out, she'll at least know that before having to hit the real world on her own.  Nothing more dangerous than sending an 18 year old Minnesota girl to NY or LA to ""Become an Actress.""  Cringe.

Taija was approached to do some legit modeling work and we recently had a shoot with a pro photographer and a stylist.  When people are beginners, it's common to trade for portfolio shots, so we didn't have to pay for anything and the guy traveled from Wisconsin to shoot her.  We were just pleased to get free head shots for her acting work.  What happened was really incredible for her, because she did a real professional 8 hour, grueling shoot.  It hurt, it was hot, it sucked, and she was a trooper.  And the shots turned out very well.  He stylist thinks she can get work, which means that she might be able to comfortably put herself through college/acting school.  Lord knows that's a blessing.  No runway for the shorty, of course, but print work is still work, and it can lead to parts.

The garage sale seems to be going well, and I am so relieved to have the shit out of the storage spaces in our house.  Mom's stuff has sat in boxes long enough, and I'm glad to see it go to good homes.  People really love country music cd's apparently.  They flew off the tables like vintage Playboys.  Yay.

Other than that, stuff's still the same..."

Hello Everyone!

Been a while!  Still doing the same old thing...holding sessions and classes to teach and administer energy healing.  Still finding it somewhat lucrative.

I'm enjoying some standing appointments, some new students, some well-deserved time with my husband, and some advances in my child's development.

My writing has fallen off a bit...must get back to that.  It's hard to have two professions and give good time to both.

Have had a disturbing psychic phenomenon lately.  Within the last 18 hours, have had the scent of death permeate my nostrils for no reason.  Wretched, really overwhelming-type death smell is very apparent to me, and then it dissipates.  Comes back in a few hours.  I'd like to dismiss it, but it seems important.  Will post when the reason for this becomes apparent."

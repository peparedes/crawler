"event","Dateline was NOT a murder mystery tonight, how dissapointing. I did spend an hour watching a report track down ""THE GUY WHO CLICKED THE MOUSE"" who sent some woman named Julie a spam porn ad for sex with farm animals. It was entertaining, I guess.

I have 2 more days in the deli. Tomorrow and Sunday. Tomorrow will be lousy I imagine, but Sunday will be the worst. My last day, and right after I get off, I'm going to Hershey Park with my friends. Both are 8 hour shifts. Although Sunday will be the longest, at least I'm getting paid time and a half. Tomorrow night I'm going ""back to school"" shopping with my family, meaning, basically dorm stuff and necessities.

I really am so excited to go back. I feel stressed out about how to divide my time amongst Pat, my family, and my friends. This is really hard stuff. I don't know what to expect next semester to be like, but I'm ready.

Summer comes and goes so quickly, and no matter how hard I try, I can never figure out the way things are going to be. This summer was unexpected, but nice in it's own way.

I really want another bowl of icecream. I really wish I actally had something to talk about, I'm just so bored."

Sara, Ashley, and I went down to Towson to visit with Melissa. She's doing well, but there wasn't much for us to do but watch TV, since she was house sitting. We watched something on VH1 of men trying to be this rich woman's lovers? It was a competition, I was really baffled about the whole thing, really. Pat is riding down seperatley when I move back in to Shepherd so Melissa may be coming with him (because she finally misses Shepherd).

I can't wait to move back in. Really. I miss everyone so much. I even miss Shaw and its metal tasting water and light coming underneath the dorm door. Shepherdstown is lovely. I'm ready to be challenged with classes instead of with rednecks wanting lunch meat. Although Shaw feels more college-dormroom-ish instead of, ""oh i have my own apartment"", it's so comfortable to me because of last year. It feels like my home. 

It's nice to come back to that.

OH, and WHY haven't any of you Shepherdstown locals informed me of the new milkshake machiene in Sheetz? This is HUGE. And I had to hear it from Chris in a thank you card, geesh."

Patrick picked me up at 9 AM. We went to Hampden for awhile. Hampden is on 36th street in Baltimore, for those of you that may not know, that is notorious for awesome vintage and record shops. (Also famous for the Hon Cafe that displays a giant pink flamingo at the top in honor of John Waters). We ate breakfast at the Hon. 

Then we went to visit his granny because it was her birthday today.

After that, we drove down to downtown Baltimore and spent a long, fun time in the Visual Arts Museum. It's really interesting and beautiful, although really small. Also, I kid you not, it has the best gift shop EVER. For example, itt had drawers of ORIGINAL holographic ninja turtle sticker 4 for $1... and other equally as awesome things like George Bush coloring and activity books. I found a lot of things that I'm going to try and create between Hampden and the museum, although I doubt they'd be nearly as succesful since they're on display...

After the museum we walked around the inner harbor and sat down and talked for awhile. I got a really good greek salad along the way too.

In an hour or so I'm heading over to Sean's for a fun gathering.

(I'm interested to know how many of these you already knew. I'm pretty open about stuff, so I wouldn't be surprised if on some of these 25 things, you've heard before.)

1. I recently have come out in the open about my weird fascination with Dateline. I love it. I'm not even going to pretend anymore. I wait to go out before or after Dateline on Fridays. If it can't be avoided, I record it.

13. I really like run dmc.
14. My 9th grade science teacher moved my seat 5 times in one month to try to get me to stop talking. He finally put me next to the smartest boy in our class, and the deaf kid in our class. He held me after class after this saying he didn't know what to do, because I even talked to them.

But, it made me remember a certain night at Shepherd.


We finished watching Dawn of the Dead with Albert and Dave. Melissa particularly was really freaked out and told me we would have to sleep with the dorm lights on. I agreed, because I was really freaked out too. When the movie was over, it was about 3 AM. Anna and Sara had just come up from Jordan's room and they were telling me, Kristin, and Melissa Anna's friend's evil midget clown story. So we were all freaked out. Just then, Albert comes running down the hall with a monster mask on. We all SCREAM at the TOP OF OUR LUNGS and bolted down the hallway and locked ourselves in Kristin's room. We all were huddled under the bed, frankly, unreasonably scared. Albert kept banging on the door like a zombie, and he wouldn't leave. He finally did though because Malachai came out and was not happy about us screaming at the top of our lungs. 

Then we all smell smoke, and the washing machiene with all of Anna's pants in it caught on fire."

We know echother's pasts.
Best friends for life...

Things aren't the same, but when we do all finally get together, it's like we never had a year apart.
I don't know what this means....
Am I the only one with this problem?

Is this problem going to transfer from home to school when I get back next semester? Are we going to have grown apart, and we try so desperately for things to be like last year? Things were so different from first semester to second, let alone having 3 months apart. I feel as though the friendships will remain the same, but not our situations.

I hope they are. I like everyone.

He pointed to the house right next to us. He informed me the house was actually 3 apartments, one being rented out and then 2 more: one for $450 a month, the other for $550. 

""Go to Towson. Live with me.""

He knows I can't.


In other news, I threw 4 bags of clothes and 1 bag of shoes out to the Goodwill today. I'm not wearing half of it, and someone could really use it. I realized I don't need over 10 pairs of shoes, 4 coats, 8 scarves... shoes, coats, scarves... these are pretty basic things some people can't get inexpensively, so why do I really need 8 scarves? I don't. So I'm donating them. My room feels a lot bigger too. It's relaxing for some reason.

My sister's boyfriend tried to fix my computer last night. He stopped counting viruses after the 105th one he deleted. I'm not sure who to blame for these viruses but for now it's Phillip, Alex, and Zak convincing me to download porn on it so we could further destroy Melissa's innocence. 

I played World of Warcraft last night with Katie and Ian. I want to be a night elf but I played as my sister's gnome. It was fun, but I'm not buying it. I didn't realize this is something I would have to buy each month. It seems like a rip off. I would want to play as a gnome so I could eventually get a robot ostrich, who wouldn't want one of those? While Katie was playing as her priest character, I got unreasonably upset that she killed a wolf. Who knows. I also watched American Psycho, which was pretty darn good. Anna called too... and she doesn't sound like her vacations have been so hot.

I'm trying to think of something clever like everyone else so everyone posts something back to this entry. I'm trying to think of a good question.

Oh, OK. What Sega game should I purchase to have in my dormroom next semester and why?"

Lately (and I'm not sure why)I've been obsessed with tattoos. I love looking at people's and even searching online looking at stranger's. There are some tattos that are just awful, and some of them that work and have meaning, and they're lovely. I knew about the tattoos I wanted to get, but I finally figured out a good way to tie the 3 of them in together. I've wanted ""Everything was Beautiful and Nothing hurt"" on my back for 5 years now. My sister designed it to look like the opening of a story, with a large E, and a scroll wrapping under the phrase after ""hurt"". And recently, I've decided I want 2 more to tie it in. I want the storybook peter pan flying through stars on the underside of my arm in bright tattoo colors for my mom/ms.rita... i don't feel like getting into the meaning, but i think most of you know that story to begin with. Last night, I figured out the best way to tie them all in. On the top of my foot I want to get an artist (I'm talking to Elise about it) to design their rendition of a carrot flower, and to tie in the phrase Happily Ever After with it.. because this tattoo is for Pat. I have a beginning, middle, end, of the story tattoos. The carrot flower is because of Neutral Milk Hotel's ""King of the Carrot Flowers Part 1""... which if you listen to the lyrics, I feel, sums up Patrick's childhood, current parental situation, and even the beginnning of our relationship. That song was written for him. And that's what I want.



:Back to Normal Live Journal Update:

Tonight Patrick and I are going to go to Panera bread and enjoy some yummy food. We're also going to go to the library and check out a movie to watch later that night. Also at the library we're going to look through Peter Pan storybooks to find a good Peter that's not the Disney version.

I only like the deli when I close with Rachel, so far... this has only happened twice.

When I got back from my 5 day trip, I knew I had to work 8-4 Wednesday... 12-8 Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. I was prepared for this. Partially because I knew that I would have Sunday off. I've never ever worked a Sunday. Well, the new schedules came out yesterday... and I'm working 5- close Sunday, 8-4 Monday, 12-8 Tuesday. My first day off is Wednesday, meaning I've been working 8 hours a day for 7 days in a row... is that even legal?

Granted, I welcome money with open arms, which is why I'm working. But my main thing is that I wanted this to be a part time job, I didn't want this deli work to consume my summer so I did nothing but work. So far, all I've been doing is working. This sucks, I hate it. Even when I'm not working, I'm freaking exhausted and I can't go out when other people are because I'm tired... AND I have to get up early and work the next morning. I was going to bed last night at midnightish when I recieved a text message from my friend...""Party tonight! Come!"" And all I could think is, yeah right... I have to go to bed.

What has become of me?!?! I hate to work. My summer is slipping away. If I'm working this much on the next schedule, I'm quitting.

"event","So this weekend was pretty darn awesome.

I love Shepherdstown. I'm counting down days until I'm back again.. everything felt as it should be. I loved hanging out with everyone Friday and Saturday. Kristin's kitten scratched the shit out of my legs though. I miss organic food and being able to walk everywhere. Watching fireworks and going to a carnival was pretty nifty too. I decided I don't really like the new bistro or icecream place...too pricey. Oh, and so far Anna and I's plans for our room consist of a High Fidelity poster and a sega genesis. Any suggestions?

As usual, our group of friends fucks up everything in our path. Single handely, we almost showed up to the wedding the same time the bridesmaids were walking in... Alex was going to lead us on a 2 mile hike through Harper's Ferry woods to find the ceremony. Jordan led 3 cars full of people in a tour bus zone that was illegal for us to be in. We all sprinted to the right ceremony after crossing 340--as it turns out, we were on the wrong side of the park to begin with--. And, as I said in a previous entry, I didn't know how I would emotionally react to the wedding. Well, I cried. A lot. Kind of hard. I wore sunglasses so no one could visibly tell, but everyone I was sitting with could tell. It was a really pretty wedding. I cried again during Chris' dad's speech. So I cried twice. I am so happy for them I just wanted to hug them 10,000 times. Tominda stepped in flowers, asked if she could cut a piece of cake for herself (before chris and hanna did)and almost caught her hair on fire. Anna and I thought the bride/groom table was just a really pretty table that no one was sitting at yet and almost sat there. So, among other things, we could have destroyed it by our volumes of stupidity, but I'd say a driving force new Chris and Hanna deserved a good wedding and kept us from doing these completely idiotic things. 

I went to the beach with the North Harford crew Sunday-Tuesday. I got home from the wedding at 1, got up at 4, and then drove 4 hours to the beach with Claudia and Sara. We kept listening to ""The Future Freaks Me Out"" & ""Holla Back Girl"". We ate breakfast with 8 old men in a McDonalds that were talking about having pet pirates. We sat on the beach all day long, ate a lot, and hung out. We also sat in A LOT of traffic. Everywhere. All the time. We stole a road cone. We were attacked by circling seagulls. A wave popped Alex's shoulder out, and gave Claudia a black eye. The guys dug a 7 foot hole and hit water in the sand. We went to a Sandlot-type carnival and watched fireworks over the water. And, I fell asleep in a hot tub. Today we went into Ocean City..shopped and ate lunch.

I'm finally home, and I'm sad and annoyed this fun filled weekend is now over. Now, all I have to look forward to is another paycheck, and working 6 days in a row for 8 hours + a day. How dreadful....

I'd say it was all worth it though :)"

After a lot of trouble on my part with my boss, I switched so I could work in the morning instead of at night so Patrick and I could go see the Aquabats at the Ottobar. On the way there I complained about the rain, and Pat told me about how great rain was because it keeps plants green and healthy...blah blah. I disagreed with him, because I hate the rain, and I especially hate downpours on 695, in the dark, on the way to Baltimore City.

We get to the Ottobar. There was a line of people wrapped around into the parking lot and even in the road. It was past then time doors were supposed to open. Finally, Ottobar workers come up and down the line with flashlights telling everyone that the power is blown and unless they could get it to work by 9, the show was rescheduled to August 20. He said we could stick around because the opening bands might play in some random alley. Although the idea of bands playing in an alley is a cool one, the idea of an alley on North Howard Street, in the dark, in the rain, wasn't cool. So Pat and I waited until 9... just in case, since we had nothing better to do.... and then when they finally annonced yeah, the show's not happening... we get into his truck and leave. 

As we're turning out from the alley, we notice that the stoplights are out, also blown out because of the horrible thunderstorms. It's dark and raining. So Pat turns onto the road right out front of the Ottobar. An Ottobar worker is directing traffic. I was glancing around, but pretty pissed. The first person I think to call is Jordan, so I'm dialing his number so I can call and tell him that the show is rescheduled to a time where we all can go together from school. I was looking down and looking for his number in my contacts, and I notice a girl pulling out kind of far. I just assume she sees us so I look down again. So... the girl...DIDN'T see us, and slammed into my side of Pat's truck. (granted the Aquabats' bus was out front and she couldn't see around it...I guess.)

Pat is relatively calm. More so then I am. As we get out of the car, there are 2 tight panted, hair over their eyes boys in goodwill shirts that come up to help. Kristin calls me as soon as this happens. I give her a quick sum up of the horrible evening, and then I hang up. Pat looks at the car and goes: ""Eh, what's one more dent?"" (This is a smashed side of a car...not a dent.)Then he asks the tight pant boys if they know anything about cars. They look like deer in the headlights and shake their head no rapidly. So, Pat's main concern is being able to drive the truck home. He tells the more knowledgable looking of the 2 to look and make sure nothing hits the wheel so he can leave. I'm standing on the side with the other boy. He goes: ""Sucks about the show, huh? Oh yeah, and that car too."" I just kind of nodded. The helpful boy tells Pat that there was something hitting the wheel. Pat gets out of the car, looks down at it and goes ""Well, shit. That's just plastic."" And he RIPS IT OFF.

The woman who was supposed to be directing traffic just walks up to me and hands me the full headlight. ""I'm so sorry. I guess I should have directed traffic better. Oh well, we should blame BGE (Baltimore Gas and Electric to you West Virginians), they hate Baltimore City, they don't help us when our power is out"" she says. Another woman, obviously a local, holding a brown bottle shaped bag, comes stumbling up screaming ""Damn you BGE! We won't have power for DAYS!!!"" And stumbles away. Pat walks up to me and tells me to get in the car because we were leaving. The car made funny noises and scraped on the road everytime he turned the wheel to far/fast.

So it goes.

For some reason, they actually gave me Wednesday off, and Thursday I only work 4 hours during the busy line times. When I'm on the line, time flies. So, if I can make it to 5 o clock tomorrow without wanting to just quit and walk out, then I can make it for awhile. I have a feeling this won't happen because I'm going to want to get off to go see the Aquabats and I'll be checking the clock every 5 minutes. I have Friday-Tuesday off for the wedding and beach. I can't wait to be back in Shepherdstown and I am so excited to go to the beach with all my friends. And to be at the beach for 4th of July fireworks.

Deli update... today, the new guy, informed me that the sticker machiene was ""off the hook"" and then later, ""whack."""

Today was the first day in the deli. They didn't know I was a vegetarian. Then a woman named Barbie Joe dumped an entire large plastic bag full of chicken blood into the sink next to me. I threw up a little in my mouth.

They realized after I had to stick a prong into a chicken body and shake gizzards and grease out that the meat was making me uneasy.

So they made me make vegetable and fruit party trays for 2 hours."

"event","Patrick and I ate blueberry cheesecake snowballs with marshmellow on Sunday and saw Madagascar. It wasn't the funniest ""kid's"" movie I've seen (nothing is funnier then the Emporer's New Groove), but the couple of parts that it was hilarious were worth it!!! I really enjoyed myself. Pat and I (mostly I) decided we want to buy more wedding presents, so we went to Bed Bath and Beyond 2 minutes before they were closing unknown to us..they printed out the registry but then pretty much kicked us out. So we're going to go back and shop... I feel bad for Pat really, because then I made him run into Target with me and look and wedding WRAPPING and CARDS. Yes, WRAPPING. When Candace and Bryan got married a couple of years ago, I made a big deal out of it. But now, now, I'm just being ridiculous. I'm honestly more excited about the wedding then going to the beach the following day. I'm just insanely happy for them because I would talk to Chris about how much he missed her, and now they get to be together everyday forever. It's so romantic I just may explode.

Other good news, tomorrow is my first day at Kleins. Hoorah! I'm working in the deli..mixed feelings... BUT Pat told me I would like the girls that worked in deli because they weren't snobby. But here's the best news of all... I'm making 7.75!!!!!!!! AND I get paid every week, not bi-weekly. This is sounding pretty darn good to me.

Last night was a lot of fun. Zak is home from Chicago for 3 days so he had people over. I got to visit with everyone, and, we ate mozzerella sticks and watched Beverly Hills Ninja. We also played with Rock-em-Sock-em Robots. I got to visit with his little brother( he's between 8-10 I think), and I forgot about how funny he was. Last time I was at Zak's house he hid in the other room and zipped a little remote controlled car into the room with a little paper flag sticking out of it that said ""GO VEGAN!"" on it. Dylan and his dog Loafer, are proud vegans. I got yelled at for eating a mozzerella stick, and also for attempting to feed one to Loafer, and this is how we found out the dog was a vegan. Anyway, Dylan had a heartattack because he realized that there were sugar in the nuts he had ate and went into a frenzy. I also learned that sugar has crushed up animal bones in it for coloring. And if a vegan eats sugar then they're not a real vegan.....

I told this story to Katie, and she comments that he won't have any friends until college, but once he gets the college, he'll probably be the coolest kid there.

I also just want to mention that last night was one of the funniest nights of my life.

Today I went to Patrick's and I really wanted to go to Falling Branch and jump off the water fall or rope swing into the water, but apparently the entire highschool was there since they got out of school 3 hours early because it was 100 degrees out. So instead we ate Boca Burgers and ate popsicles and watched Soap Operas. I think I may make Melissa go with me on Friday if I'm not working.

Tonight I'm going to Dave's, he's having a gathering... I'll get to see Zak the day before he leaves for Shanghai which is awesome because I may not see him for a long time... and I get to see Dave, who leaves Thursday, and I definitely know I won't see him again until Christmas break. So this is very awesome. I'm looking forward to it.

I hope everyone else is having fun and enjoying themselves, you know I wish I was having fun with all of you Shepherdians too!

Is it also wrong to get VERY angry when people label themselves a punk, expecially since I'm pretty sure that punk is dead, and all these people with canvas patched pants and bandanas over their faces are just kidding themselves?

Or am I missing something entirely?

I'm just glad I've never labeled myself anything or dressed an entire certain way so when I hear that my label is hosting an event, I don't feel bad for not attending.

"event","Sooo....
There have been drastic ups and downs in the last couple of days. It's been very, very, very weird.


I would like to make a disclaimer comment. I'm not sure WHY exactly, but 9 times out of 10 I'm put in the middle of a situation that I don't want to be involved in. I'm not sure why this is... I think I like to make everything be OK and so I throw myself in the middle... and while I'm trying to coax everyone and make them feel better and not be sad and hate people---the other party involved gets mad because I'm helping the person that they hate (and I don't)-- and all I was trying to do was make everyone happy!

So, long story short, that's basically what has happened between my friends in Maryland. It's really ridiculous. I feel like I'm being thrown into the depths of highschool all over again. I don't understand what the problem is to begin with. Well, I see everyone's viewpoints, but I don't want to be put in the middle any longer. Therefore, I refuse to sign on AIM or answer my cellphone. And if I answer my cell, I'm monitoring, and if I'm on AIM I'm invisible. FYI.

Does anyone else ever have this problem or I'm I just doomed to repeat this nonsense OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER again???

(I'm thinking seriously about moving to Shepherdstown next year. For good. Then I would get instate tuition. And be away from the baby mamma drama of the Jarrettsville area for good. Negative points: Leaving family, Pat, select friends... but they'll come to see me. And in the near future, I think the Hennings are moving to Bethany Beach in Deleware anyway.)  

And here's the good part of everything: I am now employed. I am working at the devil's grocery store, but I finally am working and making money, so I am happy regardless.

More goodness: Tonight I am seeing Madagascar with Patrick. I'm super excited. Also, I am very excited and looking forward to Chris and Hanna's wedding... I am excited because I love weddings...but also because I get to see everyone. I am also really excited because directly following I'm going to the beach with a great group of friends.


So really, things aren't that bad... I just get stressed out easily."

Granted more of those nights were spent in Charlestown, but Shepherdstown is the homey place. I spent lots of time with Elise. This was fun. I spent lots of time with Kristin and Alex, too. I got to see Chris, Chris, Roy, Stephanie, Tyler, Jeremy. I played zombies ate my neighbors,saw i heart huckabees (FREAKING AMAZING. After the movie was over I found myself almost directly in front of the TV staring. Tommy is my hero.), jumped on a trampoline, drank with neon straws, lost at chutes and ladders, played sims, we all were quiet during justice league, and we ate hippie food like soy crips and hemp plus granola. Kristin ate a lot of fruity icecream. So did Alex. I stayed up talking with Elise and Kristin a lot. We talked about art, music, books, boys, pasts, futures, dreams.... And stupid stuff like roller derbys. My favorite quote from this weekend is from Alex: ""That little boy is happy because Germany is winning the war!""

"event","I'm beginning to form those guitar blisters that all my guitarist friends brag about. I guess it's a good thing? Only it really doesn't display any of your talent, since I'm getting them. I am proud at the giant leap I made into musical territory last night. I know all the chords to Aeroplane Over The Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel, and I can do them in pretty quick sequence. I hear this is a simple song but I don't care because I didn't know anything less than a month ago. So ha. I guess. I have become an ebayer and frequent it, looking up random things. I got a kick ass wedding present on there yesterday, probably spending a ridiculous amount of money on it for what it is, but I don't care because I was tired of people out bidding me. Oh yeah, but why I brought ebay up to begin with... I saw a red acoustic electric guitar being bid on for 99 cents. 99 cents with 25 dollar shipping. OK, so even if that guitar is a piece... you got a freaking guitar for 25 dollars. Technically 99 cents. I'm not bidding on it because Patrick says it's a bad idea.... BUT, I'm going to Guitar Center with him next weekend and we're going to ""try on"" guitars as he calls it. All I know is I want an OK/good acoustic electric guitar. Hopefully Pat can fill in all the other blanks.

I have a substitute job at a daycare center. Not THE daycare center, but a one less than 5 minutes from my house so that's going to be good on gas. That's not really enough hours for me as I'd like, so I'm still searching for a regular part time job. I think I'll go apply to the new Greek restaraunt in the shopping center, since that's also under 5 minutes away and I can save as much gas as possible. 

My sister is always with her boyfriend. I'm always bored. Well, sort of. I've had an eventful 2 days. I went to the park with my friends from the pharmacy and fed geese. They surrounded us and hissed at us. This wasn't a good idea. We also went to Rock State Park and climbed the King and Queen seat. I was too chicken to go out to the ledge...but some biker guy went bursting past as and lept onto the edge, threw out his hands and screamed: ""THIS IS HOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALIVE! YOU GOTTA STARE DEATH IN THE FACE!""...meanwhile, I was on all 4 clutching the rock because I was certain I was going to fall and die into beautiful park oblivion. If any of you come up to visit me, I promise to take you to Rocks... it's so beautiful and fun. Later that night, I moonbounced and ate snowballs and sat around a bonfire until 4:30 in the morning Saturday with a bunch of Pat and I's mutual friends. We actually ended up playing that ""telephone"" type game (Tominda taught us that one night) for 2 hours or so and it was so much fun. I started one with ""It is too hot out today to eat a grilled cheese"" and it ended up ""That leperchaun is mad because the soup is too hot"". Who knows. But I almost peed my pants I laughed so hard. Yesterday I went to Mallory's graduation party and ate good salad and played volleyball. Sara beat me up and I tripped over the tent rope and fell outside into the thunderstorm. Sara then ran to the fence and scared all the cows away. Then, in the horizon, one of Mallory's neighbors' house caught on fire. So I think someone called 911. No one answered me if they had called or not when I kept asking. Then Pat came over and we played guitar and watched Seinfeld.

I don't really have much to say.

BUT I command everyone that read this to leave a comment to tell me how their summer has gone so far, with a useless story like I told."

...Mixed feelings....

When I left yesterday I went into dorky-locked-in-her-dormroom-alone-death-cab-for-cutie mode and started crying after I hugged everyone and walked down the hall. I didn't want to cry, but I did. I really didn't think I would cry...but I did. I went down the stairs, Chris followed me down and gave me another hug. Pretended I wasn't still sad, walked outside, starting crying again. Sobbed past the bridge... Dad finally chimes in: ""Who wants iceeecreammm??"" We go to Nutters. I sit outside on the bench I sat on with everyone the other night. I ate a big soft icecream cone. And like a good 5 year old, I stopped crying. 

I wanted to stay up the entire car ride home, since my parents made fun of me for staying up all night, but, I fell asleep after Fredrick. As it turns out, X-Men doesn't keep me up without sleep. Ho-hum.

I found my room covered with tons and tons of crap when I got back. I don't understand how all this stuff fit ANYWHERE. I went into pyscho-organizer mode and ripped my room to shreds... 6 bags for goodwill and 7 of trash so far i think...and i'm not quite done unpacking. I'm realizing what a luxerious life I lead. Although I wasn't finished, I stopped for the night and ate mac and cheese for dinner. I talked to Dani on the phone. I fell asleep on the sofa watching Dateline. Mom woke me up at 11, I walked upstairs and went to sleep in my bed with my kitty. It felt really nice. Then I remembered being home wasn't so bad.

Today, I did nothing and it's been wonderful. I'm still in my PJs and watched the Price is Right. I attempted to finish unpacking and organizing to no avail... and I talked on the phone with Patrick, Sara, and Sean for extended periods of time. I realized a lot more of my friends then I thought are already home. Sara, Jeremy, Melissa, Alex!!!... and those that haven't left..Claudia, Krysta, Tom, Dani, Britt, Meg...:)Everyone should be home soon.

I think I may be actually getting an awesome job. I have an interview tomorrow. It's at a daycare center, where every other week there's a moonbounce, movie days, WEDNESDAY SPRINKLER DAYS, being outside mainly, and field trips every month...almost making 8 dollars an hour. I really really want this job. I'll let everyone know if I get it.

Saturday is the HFStival. Going with Claudia & Dani...meeting up with: Sean, Ashley, Melissa, Matt, Nick & lady, Turner & ""SSB""(Soul Sucking Bitch-according to Alex) Looking very forward to it.

As far as Shepherd goes...I miss it. I know I'm going to miss it and everyone there, expecially over the months. I feel like I'm home for the weekend and I'll be back soon. I think it won't actually hit me for awhile. I can't wait for next year though, I'm super excited. But for next year to be as awesome as I'm hoping it to be, this will take months of regrouping, R&R, etc. to make it happen.

I love you Shepherd kids. I hope to hear from you soon.

"event","So I'm sitting here at home... pretty bored. I'm going to Pat's prom tonight and this has got me thinking. This time last year, I was so excited.. I could barely sit still, I was running around Bel Air getting ready and calling people and being so so excited... and it's really sad that my excitement about this event is gone. Eh, it's prom. It's not my prom. My best friends aren't going to be there, who cares. So I guess a combination of not having the people I've grown up with being excited around me + not being in high school anymore + missing my last weekend at college for awhile= bored. not excited. bleck. It will be fine, I'm sure. I'm riding with Meghan and Shaheen and we're all hanging out afterwards... and I'm going to get to sit with Mallory, Sara, and Katie.... it's going to be fun, just weird. Really weird. Sara and I finished the dress last night and it looks pretty kick ass. I'll post a picture or 2 on here eventually. It's even weirder because here I am going to a real prom when all my friends from school are going to a prom party because they're too old to go to a real prom. *sigh. I'm in this highschool/college warp right now, and it won't be the same until Pat is graduated. I should be more excited since technically this is my last prom ever and then it's goodbye to the highschool world forever.

Anna, Kaitlin & Sara rode home with me. It was a lot of fun. We went to Towson Town Center, a 4 story mall, ate at TGIFridays, and played Cranium with my mom, dad, Katie & her boyfriend Ian. AND we saw Dustin's lottery commerical 2 times in one half an hour span. It was pretty funny since my family was talking about how funny and ridiculous that commerical was before they knew that I knew the guy in it. My sister had a nervous break down, because apparently she thought it was the funniest commercial ever to begin with. We all screamed and laughed and it was pretty fun. Playing Cranium was pretty fun too... but of course Katie & Ian won, but Anna & I came in 2nd. My mom baked Anna lots of cupcakes for her birthday and bought her, sara, and kaitlin a present.

Being home makes me realize that this summer won't be so bad. Family, home, friends from highschool... but it's so sad to realize that everyone at Shepherd will be gone for months. And some of them 8 hours away gone. It's the same type of thing as my friends from highschool being that far away, but as I remember it it wasn't exactly easy to leave them either.

I'm excited to go home, but not at the same time.
It's strange.

This entry is pretty scattered and probably hard to follow. Sorry.

I went to New York over the weekend! It was really awesome. All I wanted to do is go to CBGBs/Bleecker street and ride the ferris wheel in the hunge Toys R Us...going to Toys R Us made me want to work there again, well, at my home.. but then I have to remember that I don't have a big 4 story ferris wheel, Candy Land, and a robotic dinosaur at mine. Just weird soccer moms and a mean boss who laughs at me when I'm cold. *Hangs head. Oh well. I didn't get to ride the ferris wheel because we didn't have enough time because of the long line and lots of little kids, but it was ok, it was awesome just to walk through it. Bleecker street was really cool. Although it is was VERY evident I was the only one interested, I was so happy I was there. I was feeling very detached though. I kept thinking... ""wow, it would be so neat to have been a punk in the 70s, I was born too late. There's no point now- but it would've been cool. I want to open a record store. Like this one. Yeah, that would be perfect. People actually live here and go shopping here, that's amazing. I want to open a shop that would make someone think the way I'm thinking... I want to dye my hair again... I want to stand next to the Bleecker street sign and be a Ramone. I wish I was alive when the Ramones were PLAYING at CBGBs...yeah..."" Then I looked back and everyone looked miserable and wet and bored. It's so weird, I have this passion for the past... I would be so focused and passionate if I lived in a time or place that allowed me to be...or be around what makes me passionate. Dirty small clubs make me feel passionate. Free show flyer bins make me feel inspired. 99 cent local band bins make me excited. I think it's so odd how I was so worked up and in awe of my surroundings when everyone else basically thought it was a shit hole. They had records. Lots of records. Amazing records... Melissa bought a Silver Jews record... I want to buy records instead of CDs now (just rip CDs into my computer). How trendy would that be?? In short, I want to be out on my own in my element. I wish I could go back there and just sit on that metal stair in the record store and dig through that show flyer been. Just sit there and watch all the people come in, and think that maybe I will actually open one of my own one day. Not in New York, because New York shouldn't hog all the cool record stores. Yeah.

I left New York wanting to explore all the things I've ever dreamt of being. Just not in New York. I couldn't imagine living there.

It was tons of fun though. I really liked walking in central park, and screaming out the windows... eating huge 9 dollar cheesecake. I wish I could've had more time. I was so glad I was with who I was with though, it was great fun.

Patrick said he's going to take me back this summer. We will stand like the Ramones next to the Bleecker street sign, and he'll let me look through the flyer box. He said, quote, that he is determined to make me have the happiest life out of anyone in the whole world. He promises me all day Bleecker street, a show at CBGBs, and dinner at Jeckel and Hyde.  

I can't wait to be out of college. I can't wait to be with Patrick. I can't wait to have an apartment."

OK, I lied about the dollar part. I have some money. I don't have a ride to most of these though. And although I have some dollars I don't have enough dollars for all. I'm definitely going to the Goodlife and more than likely Catch 22 & Tiger Army... I would kill to see the Mountain Goats but the only person I know of that would want to go with me is my lovely far away sister Katie that also doesn't have a car at college, and Patrick...who basicly lives in Jail on the weekdays, sometimes weekends too. I think I will have a job and will be at my home even closer to DC so I will probably see The Blood Brothers. I've decided when I get out of college I will buy nothing but cereal and show tickets.

More bad news- I have no clue what to do about my schedule! I'm so afraid these classes won't be offered in the Spring and I'll be screwed if I choose one class over the other. The worst news of them all- General Studies classes. I feel like I should get them all out of the way before junior year. I just HATE science. I never want to take that. Ever.

It's raining today. And it's cold. With no thunder or lightning. Not even good rain.

New York City is next weekend, which rocks. I'm really excited about it.
Patrick may actually get to spend the weekend this weekend, I'll be more excited about that if it works out.

"event","For some reason today... I am missing everyone from home a lot. A lot a lot. I'm just thinking about all the gatherings, conversations, passing bys in hallways, classes, useless evenings, exciting evenings, vacations, random road trips, and inside jokes. Sometimes the inside jokes will just pop into my head and I don't have anyone to laugh with about them anymore. I'm the only person from my graduating class even in West Virginia, let alone at Shepherd. All of us have new friends that we have tons of fun with and know pretty well but I don't KNOW them like I do the ones I've grown up with, obviously. We could finish sentences, and laugh at the same random things, know what will set eachother off, how someone will react to something, pasts and families. I have amazing friends that are sprinkled in random places of the country... Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, Illinois, Deleware... all we have in common anymore is the past and our permanent homes with our families in the same school district. Well, that's not true. Whenever I do have time to talk or see anyone from my group of friends, it's like we never went away really, and we can go back to where we left off. I just wish that things were the way they were again, I miss high school. I'll admit it, I ENJOYED HIGH SCHOOL. I'm not like a novel or a movie or a bad band, I wasn't miserable in high school, I had lots of fun, I was active, Generally I had good grades & a good amount of friends. There are people I talked to everyday that know things about me, and I will most likely not see them ever again. There are people I've loved so dearly and I talk to them maybe once a month. It's impossible to keep in touch during college. Everyone is busy and active and having fun... just like I am. I just hope they all know I still care. 

I care a lot. I miss you guys."

"event","I'm home in Jarrettsville. You know, the idea of living at home is a comforting, easy thought. I like the idea of commuting to school and seeing Pat a couple times a week instead of maybe once a month. I like the idea of when I do come home and have tons of people to see, I wouldn't have to worry or hear the parent's ""When you come home we barely see you..."" However, in this situation what is easy isn't best. I'm not going to leave Shepherd, I'm in too deep now... but I should've thought all of this before deciding automatically that I was going away for school. If I went to Towson in the first place, I wouldn't have known what I was missing in Shepherdstown. But now that I do know, there's no turning back. I couldn't do it.

Spring Break has been fun, but going away entirely too quickly. Friday night I went to Alex's house, played pool and watched Ninja Turtles 2: Return of the Ooze with everyone (everyone being Melissa, Alex, Greg, Patrick, Tom, Krysta & boyfriend... who talked too much about all the toys that he had when he was a kid and rubbing it in everyone's faces that we didn't have them. Hm.) Saturday I spent the entire day with my family- we celebrated my dad's birthday. We ate at Red Lobster, where I've never eaten before. Dad opened his presents. I saw Ashley & Dave at Best Buy... really unsual and wasn't expecting. I really enjoy their company, but I never actually realisticly thought I'd see them in person ever again. It was nice. Sunday I spent the entire day with Patrick, we went out to breakfast and ran around all over: The Pharmacy (where I used to work to see everyone.)Gabriel Brothers, Putt Putt Fun Center for his little sister's birthday party, The Mall, The Library... it seemed like a lot more places. We came back home & Mom made dinner and dessert for us. We watched Ghost World & 16 candles. Monday I went out with Meghan with a lot of hassle and trouble from Melissa & Emily, but everything was just too difficult and I didn't know whose side to be on. So I tried to be neutral. Today, I got milkshakes with Claudia, Alex Tag, and Sara...saw Pat at his house for 20 minutes before he had to go to work and I'm going out with Claudia & Sara later tonight. Tomorrow I'm going to see Pat as much as possible from the time he gets out of school, because I'm leaving to spend the rest of the break with Anna on Thursday. *Sigh. Dani got into a very bad car accident this morning, word of mouth. I'm going to try and call her house tomorrow and maybe see her, whether shes at home or still in the hospital. I can't stop caring about her no matter how hard I try not to.

I'm looking forward to summer. The cold and homework has got to go.

I held onto Patrick so tightly and didn't physically want to let him go when he had to leave Sunday night. I don't want to leave him again... I don't know how well I'm going to handle it to go back to Shepherd, because when I will see him again is completely uncertain. It may be over a month away. Mom says that's the price I paid to go away to school. But all I knew is that I decided before Patrick that I wanted to go to Shepherd. I was determined to not let him sway my decision. 

This is so heartbreaking. I count the minutes that I have with Pat... knowing that this time 48 hours from now, I'll be in Anna's house... not seeing Patrick for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks----

I never wanted a boy to effect me so much. Now look what I go and do. Oh, dear."

"event","Tonight I went to Walmart with Kaitlin, Anna & Kristin. It was really neat because we sat and talked about our first impressions and how we all first met eachother. I also got Cadance's birthday present. Also, Anna and I discussed further how freaking awesome our room is going to bed. Anna, Kaitlin, Tominda and I are going to buy Ninja Turtle walkie talkies and buzz eachother all the time... and our rooms are going to be awesome and in the B wing. Next year should be lots of fun....different, but with Anna and I rooming together there's no way things will be unevenful.

I'm extremely homesick. Living with Anna for 4 days will be lots of fun because Kaitlin Justin Chris & other people I've met and become friends with will all be there too, and it'll be neat to be in a new place for awhile However, that's 4 less days away from home. I havent been home in over a month and I want to be home... I want to spend time with my parents and my sister and all my friends from high school... and Patrick. I'm going through serious Pat withdraw. I wish I could see him more than maybe once a month...I wish that people that get to see their significant others everyday and kiss them and cuddle them and can turn to them for emotional support realize what they have, and I hope they never take one second for granted. I would kill to just lay next to him right now and just ramble about nothing. Talk about whatever is on our minds. That's the only thing I want to do right now. We have eachother figured out to the ""T""... and talking about nothing is everything when it's with him.   

I think that I will have to take Pat, hide him in my suitcase and save him from what he's going through right now. It's the only logical solution. I can't wait until he's away from it all. Him out of that house and town is what I want more than just seeing him right now. I would do anything for him to have a stable life.

My stitches come out Friday... then I can walk again. :)"

"event","Blarg. I now will forever have a phobia of snow and giggling children. Why you may ask? With snow & giggling children there either comes a horribly built ice creature...or.....sledding.

I, Jackie, the doer of insanely stupid things almost constantly, broke my record of never getting sent to the hospital (as far as memory is concerned). Well, Ok, I was in the hospital for a long time when I was 2 because well, I stopped breathing and stuff... but for dramatic purposes... let's just say I've never been to one. Anyway, I am carted away in an ambulance because I was FREAKING SLEDDING.

It seemed like a good idea hopping the fence to the football field, then hopping yet another to go down a very potentially dangerous, icy hill. Anna and Kaitlin finally bought a sled from Food Lion so we didn't need to use tupperware containers or snowboards anymore. We were sledding and having fun, playing king of the mountain... shoving eachother's faces in the snow until we couldn't breathe, tackling people, tripping them... it was super fun. Sara crashed into the fence earlier and her face got bruised and her lip started bleeding. But for some reason that didn't stop us. Oh yeah, because it was really really fun.

I was beginning to not be able to feel my legs after about the third time Alex & Chris pushed me down with their male brute force. Everyone was getting cold and tired so we decided it was time to go back. I just had to sled one more time though. The hill was so insanely icey from as slidding down it on our butts and sleds,and I couldn't stop or jump off my sled. At full force I slammed into the fence. Since my leg was near to numb, I thought it was the sheer impact that hurt. I walked around for awhile, because I always do that when I get hurt. But the pain was just getting worse. Everyone else kept sledding but Sara and I decided to start walking back. That's when we noticed blood in the snow, and blood all over my knee. Alec and Chris threw me in the back of the sled and dragged me like they were sled dogs. Once we got to the big hill by the road, I insited on walking because they were going to carry me, and I hate it when I am carried. 

We automatically go to Lydia, I take my pants off, and my entire lower half of leg is now almost covered in blood with a super deep wound smack in the middle of my knee. Everyone was freaking out, Alex called 911. These bitchy cops came in and yelled at me because I couldn't remember my social security number. Then the nice EMTs came in, said I had to go to the hospital. At this point, only Sara, Lydia, Anna & Chris are in the bathroom with me. I started crying... ""I don't want stitches. I don't want to go to the hopsital. I hate doctors. I'm scared of hospitals..."" Blah blah, sob sob.(All the truth by the way.) The EMTs strap me to the stretcher, and let me take Sara in the ambulance with me, but I really wanted Anna and Chris to come too. The thought of everyone not caring about me and me being alone in this ambulance and hospital scared and confused was more terrifying to me then stitches at this moment. Sara rode with me, Anna & Chris followed along behind.

The EMTs were really funny. They made me laugh and helped me not freak out anymore, even though my knee was still bleeding.

I get into the ER, and they let Sara stay in the room with me the entire time, which I found odd. I found it odder that they left the door wide open so I could see this rough looking guy across the hallway jumping around and yelling at the doctors. About 3 different women that looked the same asked me for the same info: ""Insurance? What happened? Pain on the scale of 1-10? Are you pregnant? Does anyone beat you? Social Security number? Address? Telephone? Spell your last name. You're going to get stitches."" The doctor finally comes in, stitches me up. I was in the hospital maybe a little over an hour... I'm not really sure how long it was. It was surreal being there.

I may just be a wimp, but the last couple days have been hell. Everything is so much harder. Typing at a computer, getting out of bed, taking a shower, eating, going to class, studying... everything. I can't bend down and pick up anything that drops... I can't put on my right shoe. This is because my leg is in a brace and I'm not allowed to bend my right leg at all. At least at my check up today, they told me I don't have to use my crutches anymore. Now I just walk with this horrible limp, like I'm a pirate with a peg leg. Basically all I want to do is be alone and in bed, I don't want to be out doing anything. I really want to cry when I watch people walk because I never realized how easy everything has ever come to me. I've had such a priveleged life... and I'm complaining about 2 weeks of inconvience. I just hate to inconvience anyone, like I'm taking too long to walk in front of them, or having to interrupt Sara from something so she can help me put on my socks and shoes. I also feel like I'm a burden on anyone that comes near me. 

I just want to hide in my room until it's all over. 

Which is insanely immature. 

But it's how I'm feeling right now."

"event","The show was on Monday and it freaking rocked. 13 of us went and we all danced and beat everyone up and it was awesome. Good music, and definitely a good way to spend a Monday night. With any luck, I'll be going to 3 shows in April: Catch 22, Against Me, and Tiger Army. This is hoping that my bank card isn't run completely dry. Also in April I'm spending 3 days in New York with a ton of my friends from Shepherd. I'm rooming with Kristin, Sara & Melissa, the coolest cats in Shepherdstown.

I had a dream the other night that my actual dream came true, that I opened an awesome, inexpensive record store on German Street. However, this could be no farther from the truth because I'm pretty sure not only would it be hella expensive to get to own ANY building anywhere... this building, being on German Street, would have to be in Shepherdstown... not only that, but I will be too poor forever to even be able to live in Shepherdstown. Everyone has these huge dreams for their futures and their jobs. I'll probably just end up being a miserable woman working behind the scenes of a TV news station. These dream jobs have to work out for someone though, right? Maybe me.

Regardless, I should've just went with Peter Pan to Never Never Land and stayed a kid forever. Stupid. *smacks myself on forehead.

These Tibetan Monks have been at Shepherd all week building a very intricate sand design on a flat table. Today, they destroyed the final design...and gave all of us a little ziplock baggy of sand. We went to Town Run, they prayed and chanted, and we all dumped our sand in the river. Apparently, all the energy they put into making the sand design is supposed to go into the water, evaportate, and then rain upon us. This was all to promote world peace and harmony. This all sounded incredibly good and interesting to me. Buddhism is extremely interesting, I read the Dhammapoda for Asian History and was inspired by it. I don't think any organized form of religion is for me though.

Tonight I'm going to go see Constantine with Anna, Chris, Kaitlin, and whoever else wants to go. I haven't seen a good scary movie in awhile. I'm very excited.

I've got the idea to start borrowing CDs from the radio station 5 at a time, uploading them, and then bringing them back at my next show. I borrowed Le Tigre, The Dickies, The Graduates & Dance Hall Crashers this week. I'm pretty set on borrowing the new Mars Volta next.

OK, I'm going to change in a hoodie. It sounds much more comfortable."

"event","Sundays are the worst days of the week. You always sleep in really late because you know all you're going to do is lounge around in your pajamas and do all the stuff you put off for the rest of the previous week. You don't do that? *pff, yeah i don't either...I was kidding...?

Last night Kristin, Sara, and I decided to throw a dance party in the seminar room. We went to Walmart and bought glowsticks, streamers, balloons, and we borrowed blacklights, a strobe light, christmas lights. It was lots of fun. We all danced to 80s music and ska. Everyone wore bright fun clothes and it was awesome. I had fun at least, I hope everyone did too. Besides when Anna slammed her head against the door. That wasn't too cool. I'll try to post pictures sometime. After that, I sat in Chris Petersen's room and we just talked for like, 2 hours. It was awesome. Then I went to bed.

This morning I went and ate waffels with Kristin. We talked with Kaitlin about movies, old guys that are hot (consenus? George Clooney, Richard Gere, Tom Cruise-only with grey hair like in Collateral.), and sexuality. I guess I'm not very in touch with my sexuality because recently I've decided I find things degrading that some people don't. I guess I'm not as liberal as I thought I was. When it comes to sexuality that is. I went to Nutters with Anna, Emmy, Julian & Russel, which was fun... even though I was the only one that didn't go to their high school so that was sort of weird. But it was still really fun.

Patrick and I have been bickering about stupid stuff. Stupid stuff like missing times to call eachother and forgetting to do stuff. I think it's really weird about how we bicker so much more when I'm in Shepherdstown and he's in Cardiff then when we're both together in one place. When we're in close proximity to eachother, we don't bicker at all. It's weird. It's just frustrating to not be with the person you care about. It's even werider that when we started being together both of us didn't know it was going to last long at all. It's been a year and a half. It's impossible to predict anything...expecially feelings.

Not predicting feelings seems to be the underlying trend at Shepherd lately. Everyone is confusing and falling apart. I feel very put together compared to everyone, and I've never felt more put together than anyone before. I really loved talking to Chris last night because we both feel melancholy about being away from our significant others, that, and we aren't in the middle of this huge theatrical drama he said/she said bullshit. That and the fact that we're friends and it's good to just talk about nothing with someone sometimes. I just wish everyone would take 5 minutes and look at themselves. And realize what they say and do. I think everyone would get a reality check if they did that.

I have a feeling I'm going to become very unpopular here soon. Because I'm getting really tired of holding in everyone's gossip. It's starting to effect how I feel. Maybe I'll just sleep a lot and forget the gossip?? 

And I miss my Mom, Dad, and sister. A lot. Honestly.

(Oh and Claudia! It's her birthday today!)

We're all going to go rock out at the Ottobar Monday night to Say Anything. It will be interesting to see how rides will turn out because no one wants to drive the 2nd car even though a lot of people have a car. There's 13 of us going which is crazy, but that will just be 13 times the rocking.

So I'll post after that."

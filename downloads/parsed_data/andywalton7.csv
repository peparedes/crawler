"event","Been sooooo fucking depressed recently. Not even anxious (much), which is a new one for me. I'm fully acquainted with the horrors of a major anxiety episode but until now Ive never really dealt with the whats-the-fucking-point-no-really-I-cant-think-of-anything-good-in-my-life-that-won't-be-gone-in-six-months kind of pure depression. Wrote down a list of 10 things that make my life shit the other day but don't want to reproduce them cos theyre just too upsetting. Dave is going to be gone in four months, the band is stalling (at least in the sense of taking it a stage further towards going professional), I am single and lonely and miserable and dealing with the fact that all my friends are much more attractive than me, I haven't got a clue what Im going to be doing next year as I don't think I'll be accepted for an MSc course and as such I don't know if I'll be eligible for living in Unipol housing with the rest of the guys, the anxiety keeping playing with me every so often. Worse, everyone seems to think I'm jolly Andy who's always so happy and smiley. If only they fucking knew..."

"event","Hmmmm yes well... first off apologies for any incoherence this particular update may feature but it's Wednesday morn and I've just got back from the mighty Cockpit and as such am probably not in the best of conditions to be making a diary entry. (although am probably in the best of positions to be telling the full truth in true drunken fashion) Can't deny it, the main piece of news which has affected me today is that Holly decided to end our relationship. To be fair, I don't think it was working in any major sense for either of us over the last couple of weeks and as such it didnt come as a massive surprise. At this point, I am reminded of the words that the great Daniel Maddox. (my sadly now ex close friend- the one true regret I have in my life) ""SHIT HAPPENS"" She was and is a lovely person and a very attractive girl but it obviously wasnt ment to be so why worry? There can truly be no kinder way to end it with a person than when they are about to go to the world's greatest temple of drunkenness, Leeds' very own Cockpit. Tonight I got battered in a way that rendered me almost unable to make it home, which was just what the doctor ordered. It was a fantastic night out (especially considering I'd been dumped 2 hours earlier... ;)) and just generally made me glad to be alive! Was extremely happy to recieve word from the gorgeous Sarah that she has made it her New Years resolution to come and visit me as well. (Providence? You decide...) Apart from that was quite content to get off my tits on vodka and coke and smack a few people around to the sounds of Pantera and Metallica. Killer. On our gig front, CJ messaged me over MSN today to inform me that the promoter dude from the 'Pit had got back to him and offered us a gig there on January the 28th. While this isn't officially confirmed, if it does go ahead it'll be the most exicting moment of my entire life. (especially if we play the main stage) The Cockpit is a large (by local band standards) and extremely prestigious venue which, to be quite frank, saved my fucking life. I am quite serious, if it wasnt for the club nights in this fantastic place and the sense of camerarderie and companionship I got from being a ""regular"" I would have been a shadow of the man I am today. If we play there (fingers crossed!) I'll be over the moon to give something back to them. Anyway, this is a down but never, ever as long as I fucking live out, Andy saying peace out to anyone who stumbles across this journal. Now I'm off to bed to dream of what might have been. I'll be your bitch..."

"event","They say in life that you can't cheat death or taxes, and neither can you avoid going back to school/college/uni/work/the institution once Christmas had finished. Had a lovely surprise on my last day in Stoke, Mart came round for a few beers and did our usual thing of sitting in the conservatory til 3 in the morning and getting plastered. Apparently Cartel are doing well which is good news. I'm desperately trying to get them a gig with us up here but CJ seems to want to play with more local bands to get a bigger crowd which is I guess fair enough. Anyway, was hungover as fuck coming back, which wasnt exactly helped by Mums insistence on waking me up at 8:30 in the morning.  Journey back was fairly uneventful and I celebrated my return to Leeds with a big bottle of cider and a game of GTA: San Andreas with Dave. Did very, very little on Friday apart from hang around and drink beer with Dave all day. Revision is progressing slowly but surely so didnt feel too guitly about that. The Attic Project had their first rehearsal of 2005 on Saturday which was fantastic! It felt so good to get back into the studio again after the Christmas layoff. The old stuff all sounded reasonable (apart from Mike forgetting the words to Down By The River) but everyone knows that rehearsing and playing live are such completely different things that even perfectionist me wasnt too worried by the odd timing slip. We wrote a new song - a one and a half minute blast called No Souvenirs. It's kind of reminiscent of Green Day's Jaded in that its the perfect song to just launch into at the end of something more considered. (like they used to do with Brain Stew) Should be doing it at the end of Solution or Day Off Work when we play it live.  Saturday night was Sumayyah's 21st party. Originally Holly was gonna come down for it but she wasnt up for partying in the end sadly :( Went with Dave and CJ instead and got absolutely wrecked in a way that I havent been since my own 21st. Ended up calling for Bug for some reason and dragging her out too, and filling our pockets with everyone elses booze when we left ;) Went back to Bug's and drank more of our stolen booty, before staggering back to ours on legs of rubber and passing out in bed. Today's been mostly taken up with revision (SY33 - Distributed Systems tomorrow) and hangover nursing but I did get hold of a copy of the recording of Down By The River that we did with the student producers from LCoM. Its awesome!! Our best song sounding fantastic because it's actually (whisper it) produced instead of just recorded. Mustve listened to it about 50 times today and it just pisses on any of our other recordings. Fantastic!"

"event","Today a bad thing happened to me. I watched A.I. It was officially the worst film I have ever seen in my entire life. I could go into a detailed critique of why I disliked it on the grounds of its technical innacuracies (speaking as an A.I. guy myself), the huge irritatingness of the lead character, stupid ending and its general sweeter-than-drowning-in-a-vat-of-care-bear-juice sickliness, but I can't think about it without weeping copiously, so I won't. At least it had a cameo from Ministry in it. (they need to pay for the smack somehow) Practised my bass again today for the first time in ages. I definitely needed a little break from it cos Ive been doing at least 45 mins a day for months now. Re- learning some Reel Big Fish tunes (ska bass is so much fun to play!) Apart from that, didnt do anything exciting, cracked on with some revision but that was about it. New Years Eve tomorrow yay! Sort of getting back into a Leeds frame of mind now, only a week to go til I'm back at uni."

"event","The trouble with Christmas being over is that it means you can't really put off revision any longer. Made a start yesterday but to be honest it's all going pretty well (probably cos everything else at home is so boring Im relishing the opportunity to do something different, even if it is boning up on legitimate and non- legitimate XML tags) which is vaguley surprising. Ive got my little plan together so that all the modules get a given number of days according to how hard they are and whether theyre open notes or not and everything! Had a big family get together on Monday, which was as good as big family get togethers ever get. (i.e. not very but it's not like anyone lost a limb or anything over the course of the day so things could have been worse) Apart from that, nothing really to report. Went into the Orange shop today and was amused to see that the manager guy recognised me from all the times Ive been in with this damn phone. Still waiting for Orange customer services to get back to me but it has just been a four day bank holiday so Im not THAT enraged. Dad pretty much had a go at me for not being angry enough about the whole thing when we came out of the shop but, like I explained, the guy in the shop can't give me a new phone until Orange Tech. Services have investigated it. Which is a pretty stupid system I'll admit but it's there and going red in the face is just going to increase the risk of a coronary episode rather than the chances of me getting a new phone. Better to grumble quietly... Off to Birmingham on New Years Eve and I still havent got a clue how it's all going to work out (the whole thing seems like a bit of a crazy mission) but I'm sure it'll all be good in the end!"

"event","I think its fair to say that the novelty of being at home in a house that isnt full of pizza boxes and empty absinth bottles has officially worn off. Was home always this boring? At first it was nice to see my folks again and not have to worry about making my own meals and stuff but Im bored out of my brain (or ""bored out of my tiny"" to use my Dads ludicrous expression. Tiny what? Dont answer that.) now and even playing bass loses its appeal after all you did last week was play the same damn song for 5 hours a day until you got it EXACTLY right. Should be back in Leeds on the 7th, which cant come soon enough as far as I'm concerned, even if it is exam period.

Worse, I'm getting increasingly stressed about next year. An MSc in Information Systems sounds great on paper, especially living with CJ, Andrew and Mike, but thinking more closely the idea of spending a year working twice as hard as before with no student loan and living with two pissheads and a hardcore stoner (two of whom are doing gap years this year and will therefore be a) loaded and b) in the mood to get smashed every night after a year of healthy puritanism working in York) sounds like a recipe for disaster. Don't get me wrong, theyre GREAT guys, but I cant see myself getting much MSc work done in that setup, especially coupled with the fact that I'm gonna NEED to get a job to finance my living (no more timing the spending on the student loan just right for Andy). The alternative, however, is get a full time job in Leeds and still live with the band (probably not a good idea), get a full time job and live on my own (almost certainly not a good idea) or move back home (definitely not a good idea). In other words, Im screwed no matter what I do. And to put the crapulent icing on this shitty cake, I'm gonna have to reapply for (whisper it) Alton Bloody Towers to get money before I go too. Bah.

Mentioned to Mum that my exams started on the 10th today, just in a sort of making-conversation way, like you do. Cue fit along the lines of ""Thats so soon! You havent done any revision yet! <insert name of Mums friend here>'s daughter stayed at uni until Christmas Eve doing extra work!"". I find it amazing that, at 21, Mum (and it is mostly Mum, Dad nearly trusts me) still thinks that if she didnt TELL me to revise, then I wouldnt do any revision. I put up with it all the way through GCSE and A- level but I thought at least once I got to uni I'd get some peace to do my own thing revision-wise. Evidently not. And I'm sick of being compared to her simpering mates stupid Oxbridge student kids, putting me down as if getting 5 A's at A- level and going to Cambridge to read Pure Maths is what every normal kid does, and I'm somehow inferior because I didnt measure up.

Blimey, arent I a miserable basted today? Sorry!"

I went through a phase of not really liking Christmas between the ages of about 17 and 19. I was probably too old to appreciate it in the bloody-hell-look-at-all-my-presents way and too young to appreciate it in the isnt-this-nice-a-time-for-all-of-us-to-get-together way, or even the wahey-an-excuse-to-drink-all-day way that I now appreciate it in so fully ;) To be honest though, I enjoy it quite a lot now. Everyone bitches about buying presents but how hard is it to buy stuff for people really?? Anyway, this Christmas was pretty much the same as any other, got woken up much too early, opened my pressies with my sister, faffed around witrh the Futurama DVD for a bit then started on the sherry. Lunch was the full Christmas works (turkey, stuffing, sausages, bacon thingies, gravy, bread sauce, peas, potatoes (roast and boiled), roast parsnips (yummy), broccoli, sprouts (I think sprouts are much underrated)) with apple crumble (dont like Christmas pud) to follow, all washed down with a whole bottle of Mateus which left me feeling like a pissed up version of the Hindenburg. Managed about an hour after that before falling asleep. Not a lot exciting happened after I woke up, apart from the fact that it was snowing fairly heavily (Holly reckons it was really snowy in Skipton in the morning- was v. jealous!!). Wooo Ive written another mini novel! I love writing these little essays, its like one big ego trip. Not that anyone will ever actually read this of course..."

"event","Don't even get me started on Orange today. Ironically, Im sure I could have got a better contract on, say, O2 (although my Orange contract is pretty good) but I stayed with them on the basis that Ive been with them since I was 16 and never had any problems at all. Ever. Until now. Went into the Orange shop and ended up talking to, of all people, Mike B. Felt mildly guilty about coming in to kick off at him after all the times we've stood shoulder to shoulder while some knobhead whinged at us at the Towers but still... Anyway, he was super helpful (it pays to have friends in high places) and promised me that if the lastest set of SIM updates didnt work then I could take it back yesterday evening for a new phone. Suffice to say, they didnt work (the phone works fine when other SIM cards are put in it though, meaning its either the phone not allowing the SIM card to be updated or the SIM card refusing to be updated thats the problem) and so back to the shop I went. Mike was busy with some other bloke so I had to make do with the ""assistant manager"" who, let me say here, had the intellect of a piece of belly button fluff. Spent 20 unhappy minutes on the phone to Orange tech services, where they basically told me that theyd never had a K700 do anything like that before and they would ""look into it"" and ""get back to me"". They have til Tuesday (my deadline, not theirs). Woe betide them if I dont have a working K700i by then...

Got back in a filthy mood and watched some cookery prog on the TV while drinking beer, followed by Teachers (I'd never seen it before! Isnt it funny!?) and bed.

Today I've done just about nothing again, apart from discover that Ive lost all my skills at FIFA 2003 and my sister is now much better at it that me which was a bruise to the old ego I can say. Learned Time Bomb on bass today, technically not the hardest Rancid song but it took me ages to get my head round it actually. Mmmmm, I smell Carbonara for tea, gonna make a move I think..."

"event","Hmmm yes well OK I finally got talked into gettin a Livejournal. (by Holly during a discussion about how I'm not under the thumb at all... draw your own conclusions there!) So, only 21 years and 2 months of my life to update on then!!!! As I can't be bothered to do that I'll start from last Friday...

Anywho, we had our gig in Islington last Fri, which went well despite only four of the about 35 Londoners we'd asked to come showing up. Mike and Andrew looked a bit miffed at first but in the end we took heart from the fact that it was our first gig in front of a totally alien crowd, (as in a crowd full of people we didnt know, not a crowd of face sucking spiders that laid their eggs in our stomachs and stole our pints) and we still played really tightly, as opposed to the last time it all started going a bit wrong (in York) where we kind of imploded and couldnt wait to get off. 13 gigs and the practice is beginning to show ;) We crashed at Matts where I got cat hairs on my T- shirt, as well as in my eyes, up my nose etc etc from sleeping on the floor but hey, such is life...

Got back on the Saturday (we had a wicked video idea on the way up!! Security guards! With our instruments chained to our arms like briefcases full of cash and playing in the back of an armoured van!) and had the energy to do precisely nothing for the rest of the day except lie back and read my book.  Sunday was taken up with a trip to the German market in Birmingham (Which, incidentally, was EXACTLY the same as the Leeds one. Do these people buy the stalls flat pack or what?? Perhaps they just add water and Willies Bavarian Sausage Playground is ready to go. I don't know.) but it was all good in the end cos me and Holly made it all official! Which succeded where the sausages had failed in putting a big smile on my face and giving me a warm glow inside. In all seriousness though, she's soooo lovely and I'm really happy about it all :) Yay for life in general and Holly in particular!

Went to the pub with Alan on Monday, where I proceeded to get quite drunk and generally make merry. Once Geri had finished her shift we spent half an hour chatting (actually half an hour of me and Alan bitching about the people we used to work with at Towers- few were spared!) before we went back. 

I'll carry on with the chronicles of today (subtitled Getting Orange to send me the right SIM update for my new phone!) when I can be bothered. All this typing wears you out you know!"

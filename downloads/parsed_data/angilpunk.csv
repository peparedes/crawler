"event","This weekend kate and i went to reno for the hoobastank concert, but when we got there we found out that drudge and phantom planet were also playing, so it was 2 cool for skl...  I just want to personally say, kate, thank you for coming onto the floor.  Even though there were evil tall people in front of us.   The whole concert kate and i were on the floor, except we were leaning against the rail, but it was cool.  but when hoobastank came on we went closer to the stage.  we tried to avoid the moshers... but the mosh pit just kept getting bigger, and BIGGER, so we couldn't really avoid it.  but there were these three weird annoying blonde chicks that looked and dressed ALL alike, it was scary.  they all wore dark blue jeans, black tank tops, adn these belts made out of shells, and they all had blonde hair, except for one girl who was brunette.  they kept going into the moshpit but were totally getting their asses kicked, lol, kate pushed them in purposefully a couple of times...good for you girl!  lmao, kate, i think the boy in the black blink 182 shirt was stalking you... muahahahha... thank you for letting me borrow your hoobastank shirt!  don't worry, i'm washing it right now so when it gets back to you its downy fresh and squeaky clean... i still think you looked kick ass in that black hat...so sexi... lol. but yeah, neways, drudge was pretty awesome but they didn't interact with us AT ALL, they just played, kind of boring.  phantom planet was awesome, all of the guys in that band have the same haircut, lmao.  their so skinny!!!  hoobastank kicked ass!!!  they seem like nice ppl..lol.  the lead singer took off his shirt...hehehehe... and so did the drummmer... kate, i love your cd's that you played on the road!  lol, queen was very inspirational... i can't believe that one band (sry, can't remember their name) did a remix of the supremes i will survive song...it was really really good.  well that was my awesome weekend with kate, i must go get ready for crew now, tty babes l8er."

"event","Hey kids, hows it goin.  Life's good.  Its summer, no school, boys run around half naked, crew camp and making new friends.  I'm SOO happy i took this f'ing crew camp! Its awesome!  There are tons of nice people in it.  Carpooling with Holly, Hannnah and mark's cool.  Mark and i are in the canoeing group...holly and hannah are in the kayaking group, but we switch next week so that'll be cool. KC and wyatt are in my canoeing group, it was the FUNNIEST thing EVER, they tipped over their canoe and so much water got in it that it was sinking so fucking bad adn they couldn't get it out of the water, lmao.  than alex jumped out of our canoe and i fell in... the water in the river felt SO good.  warm, but sometimes cold.  than we had too much water in our canoe, so we had to have somebody come and help us with ours to get it out... and now today is the last day of canoeing... WEWHEW!!!!!!  i mean its fun, but the way you have to sit in them, it hurts like an f'ing BITCH.  and it completely killed my osch-goodschlatter.  speaking of my oschgoodschlatter... NOBODY at the camp knew wtf it was.  not even the coaches.  i swear, i feel like me and marissa are the only people who have it!  but yea, its been hurt so bad from canoeing its swollen to twice its size and itz purple now...lovely huh, lmao.  sry, this is a random livejournal... nobody thinks i write in it and maddie's my only buddy so i don't think anyone's going to read it...so i'm just talking about stuff. yupyup... omg, there's SOOOOO MANY MOVIES out!!!! i want to go see ALL of them! they look so good!  muahahahaha... i can't WAIT till this weekend kate! oh its gonna be SO AWESOME!!!  kate and i are going to reno for the hoobastank concert... i still can't believe you asked me to go with you! you are so awesome!i absolutely LOVE hoobastank.  kate you and i are gonna SOOOOOOO party babe!!!!!

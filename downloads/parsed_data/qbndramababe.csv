"event","<p>I haven't updated this thing in...years...but greatestjournal shut down, and honestly I like writing. It gets crap out of my system. Sometimes I regret it. I look back at old journal entries and realize how stupid I was. I wrote paragraphs after paragraphs on ""love"". Undying, relentless, hurtful love. In retrospect, it all looks like nonsense. Pure nonesense. And what bothers me the most is that it goes against everything I am. Conclusion, no more sappy love entries. And a disclaimer. Should I ever feel horridly and have to vent, please (cosita) don't hold it against me. I've always felt journals should have names, mine will be cosita. Coincidentally Gary's nickname but I supposed he is somewhat my journal also so it is fitting. I'm bored and I feel purpose-less. I don't know what my parents did to make me feel so guilty whenever I am not being productive, but whatever it was, they did it well. I never get to relax. I spend my relaxing time thinking about the things I should be doing and my productive time wanting to relax. It's quite the conundrum, maybe its all a matter of scheduling but I've always felt that to be such&nbsp;a waste of time. Scheduling is what I do when I'm tired and want to relax but still feel productive. I feel lonely, also. I never want my emotions to get in the way of my life, but I suppose in one way or another they always do. Sometimes they propell me to be better, sometimes they hold me back. And it feels awful when I (unwillingly) give them a part but I don't think it should. After all, they are a part of me. Everyone has the right to feel. How come the founding fathers didn't include that in their stupid declaration of independence. You have the right to pursue happiness, whatever the fuck that means, but you don't have a right to feel your emotions. Maybe its all one and the same.&nbsp;<br />I think I should distance myself from Gary. Its not cause I still have feelings for him or cause I'm afraid, none of that; its cause I know the friendship is off balance. He has a partner, I don't. Therefor, even as a friend, he means more to me than I to him. And thats bad. It's funny...when we're little they give us all that nonesense about giving without thinking of what you're getting in return. In reality, its bullshit. In the real world, no matter how much you want to give, you need to watch your back. It's not about selfishness, its self protection.&nbsp;<br />In a relationship, even if you don't care about receiving as much as you desire to give, you need to be careful. Because receiving is an indication that the person you're giving to wants it and deserves it. That the person wont hurt you. Again, not a matter of selfishness at all.&nbsp;<br />But even then, no matter how much attention you pay, its all bullshit. Because nothing is stable, nothing stays the same a whole lifetime. Nothing stays the same a whole day for crying outloud! Sometimes I'll wake up and look in the mirror and think that I'm okay. I'm decent looking, relatively intelligent, and fairly accomplished. Maybe I'm the most beautiful or intelligent, but I'm a pretty decent package, I tell myself. Then&nbsp;I go out and when I come back in and undress, I want to cry. Cellulite glares at me, my breasts sag, my stomach makes me feel deformed, my face is too round, I realize I haven't done all I could in school, I feel lonely, etc. Everything changes within the span of 5 hours, maybe. And I could never, till this day, understand why. I love lists. I've kept them about almost anything at some point or another in my life. Things I (dis)liked in others, books, movies, words, likes/dislikes, pet peeves, goals...all my lists are pretty stable. That's why they can be put into ink. But I could never make a list about the things i (dis)like in myself.&nbsp; It seems to always be changing, to never be concrete. I think all I know about myself is my reaction towards nouns (people/things/events). For example:&nbsp;<br />I like cheese, wine, coffee, dark chocolate, hot dogs, bread<br />I like cold milk with coffee and special K strawberry cereal<br />I like knowing random facts, like that Dr. Kellog was trying to invent a food so bland it would kill sexual appetite&nbsp;<br />I like history, politics, and things to do with people and what makes us people, not animals<br />I do believe in peace, in making a difference, in ideals, in virtues, and in the value of mankind despite himself.<br />I definitely like sex.&nbsp;<br />I always like the exposition. Getting to know a character, a person, a place. That's the best. I hate endings, I don't like goodbyes.<br />I run. Always. When I need to shut up, I'm full of words and attitude but if the ocassion calls for it, I never ever confront. And when I go back to do it, of course, its too late.&nbsp;<br />I HATE feeling pathetic. I don't admire emotional people. <br />And I love the fact that I can google anything.<br />I think wine glasses and shoes are some of the msot sensual things in the world.&nbsp;<br />When I dress differently, when I try too hard, when I&nbsp;put together random outfits I've never worn before;&nbsp;its usually cause I don't want to be myself that day.<br />When I find a person who cares enough to get to know me, to know every little detail on this list, I will always keep him by my side.<br />I find observation one of the greatest virtues--and one I rarely possess.<br /><br />I'm tired...and not that interesting.<br /></p>"

"event","Graduation was yesterday and it was really awesome. Hahaha to the idiots that didn't go (ex: Ralfy, Javy, Ryne!). I got to sit on stage where I could make fun of everybody and me and lil Luis couldn't stop laughing and talking the whole time. Gio went with me. And he brought me flowers [aww]. lol. I got the FCAT thing for Math. Congratulaions to me. And I'm finally a freshman. woo hoo. lol. Lucky me[at] (get it [meat]). 
Afterwards we went to Olive Garden (Andrea, Shorty, Vanessa, Gio, and families). We had a nice time. None of the young people ate. lol. And we didn't get to drink wine though we were the ones celebrating. And in the parcking lot we screem ""We're freshmans!"" really really loud. Aren't we cool. lol. Everybody laughed at us. That should eliminate most embarrasing moments of the year. How great. And yeah. Then we went home. Me and Gio argued about his schooling throughout the whole night but w/e thats private. 
So yeah;

CONGRATULATIONS 8TH GRADE CLASS OF 05
GRADUATES IN 09!!!!!!!
WOOO HOOO!
OFICIALLY FRESHMAN"

"event","hei guys. dont think i've updated in a while. everythings going pretty good though im kinda in a bad mood right now cause of my relationship but whatever. I gotta get it off my mind somehow. So anyway. Here's whats up.

1. The Highlights Of Broadway Show came out good I guess. I twisted my ankle right before the show so sorry if my performance sucked. And not a lot of people liked it cause its not contemporary but I did. 

2. My ankle got better but on wednesday I ran and fucked it up again so tis hurting but I can still walk on it so thats good.

3. I'm finally thru with my finals and happy to be! I think I did fairly in most of them. We'll see when the grades come out.

4. I plan on going to school tuesday and wednesday. Those are the best days so of course. 

5. We had rehearsels for the graduation today. It was like an hour long. Gradution is next friday by the way and it should come at nice. I'm planning on wearing a below-the-knee black dress. Is that appropriate? O! and I wanna plan soemthing for afterwards. Anyone got suggestions?

6. Tomorow Chino is coming from Orlando and we're having a party/movie night at Shorty's.

7. People that are leaving next year (that I know of): Heri & Tayrone are going to Goleman. Luisa is going to American. Carlos is leaving to Orlando. Anyone else? I'll really miss yall!

Alright that's all I can remember right now. Update later."

Wazzup? I'm here bored. Today was an alright day. My thighs are killing me because of Martinez and her launches. And tomoro I have PE again which sucks the most. It was so funny cause yesterday I saw that the Walt-Mart balls (and all others) have her name written on them and ever since thne I pretend its her head and I've been hiting a lot better. LoL. I'm so evil. 
Today Barby and I ""made-up"".  Like, to the point where we talk to each other and shit. I have to admit I'm happy about that. I'm sorry if it disappoints anyone. Things wont be like before though so dont worry. I've learned my lesson.
I don't have much else to say but that Gio is really getting to me. I mean, just, the way he acts gets on my nerves because he acts like he doesn't give a shyt. I also wonder if I'm really waiting for anything. I feel like our relationship is down the drain.

Brief Annauncments:
-Please buy ur prom tickets! Tomoro's the last day!
-I think I came out cagged in the Spring Picture.
-I am doing better in Math and Science, I think."

<OL>
<LI>I am officially single. Me and Gio are not only broken up but also no strings attatched. Meaning we dont act like a couple. I don't plan on hooking up with anyone but still. </LI>
<LI>Hector's (10thgrader) Birthday was today. HAPPY SEVENTEENS!!!</LI>
<LI>Javy's Birthday is on friday, just in case I don't update by then.</LI>
<LI>Barby and I aren't talking. It's a long story. I'm sad and mad and I just don't even wanna talk about it.</LI>
<LI>Prom tickets are only being sold till friday and I'm BEGGING evry1 to go. Its gonna be really nice and we got a beautiful banquet hall, and a beautiful theme, and food and dancing. C'mon what else can u ask for?</LI>
<LI>My room is being worked on as we speak. We started to knock down the wall (b/w mine and the other rooms) but then found out there was a pipe ther and we ended up having to do an opening and a lil counted next to it. I'm getting the bean-bag I wnt as soon as I find it. O! and we'r gonna paint the walls a sand color, cause black is too hard to take off later.</LI>
<LI>I'm doing horrible in Algebra and its frustrating.</LI>
<LI>I LOVE old music. And I have so many old songs stuck in my head it isnt even funny anymore.</LI>
<LI>Anisa is a fat dumb man but now not even she will go with me to prom. I'm pathetic.</LI>

"event","hei guysz. im about to go to skool but if i type fast enough i can tell you what happened yesterday. it was a regular skool day w/e. afterwards i had practice. i got home lyk at five. took a shower, ate and went to the mall cause i needed underwear/thongs. so anyway then i get home and gio calls me.

[i didnt have time to finish in the morning cause i had to run. here's the continuation]

Gio calls I pick up like ""hi baby"". He goes ""Don't even call me baby. This is what happens every time I start trusting a girl. This is what I mean about the screwing me over. Well you kno what, its over. You could go hook up with Javy or whoeva the fuck u want and go to prom with him and be happ-e with him.""
and I didn't get it at first cause I hadn't done anything wrong. So I started calling him. I was really upset. And I started asking who had told him what but no one said anything and finally Jeanette calls and he tells her that some one told him I wanted to go to prom with Javy. I know wat they told him wasn't a lie but I feel real upset cause I had only said that to four people whom I really trusted and I don't know how it got to Gio. 
For a while I thought he wouldn't forgive me which would have sucked. But then he called and was like ""wazzup?"" and he said he forgave me. And we were friends for like an hour and then he was just like ""O baby lets not lie to ourselfs I want u back."" And yeah he asked me out again and thats that.

there's not much else to say. today was an okay day. im looking foward to early release this thrusday. what plans ya'll got? im thinking ama chill with jeanette but i still dun even kno how ama get home. lol. alrighty im out. i got tons of hw to do as always and catechism today. o! and i got a C in my science test so I didn't fully fail but still.

Mainstreet sucks lately. Hardly no one was there. I couldn't make it to Dolphin though. And at night when I got home I talked to Gary on the phone. It was fun. No biggie. Just normal pillow talk [for me that mean random conversations while ur real sleepy] for a little while but y'll know me.

friday- during skool- it wasnt a really good day. u c, anisa and javy and mely and half my friends went on a field trip and i cudnt go so i was pretty bored though ryne and anthony and steve and phil and a lot of ppl made me have a good time. but at the same time i was really tired from the night b4 and apperently was getting a cold which eventually turned into a fever and by fifth period i was trembeling and with purples lips and watery eyes of how bad my head hurt yet the teacher STILL wudnt let me do my work outside of that stupid ice box.
after skool- ne-way once i got home and took some pills i got better and at night I went with Gio and my parents and some other people to a concert which wud have been cool but I felt lyk I had a drumset inside my head. After that we went to eat at La Carreta nd I ordered a Cuban Sandwhich but when it came i took ONE bite and left it there cause I didn't feel lyk eating. Don't even ask. lol.

saturday- I was wit my dad and we piked up my step bros who i hadnt seen in the longest and at night we went to dinner at some placed called La Granja, but first we had to pass by church and that pist me off cusz i wasnt feeling good still.

sunday- still with my step bros, we went to church in the morning and then in the afternoon we were at Dolphin. I saw Christina Tavarez and Hector (Prici's ex) there. Didn't really talk to either, just chilled with my step bros - good times. And now I'm baq at my house (moms house, not dads) and gotta do hw after I update my private journal. 

so yeah. that really wasnt short. sorry. ill put up pictures of the whole weekend soon, wen i get them frm my dad. theyll be scary (im in em) but u guysz can sacrifice. lol."

im here bored again. gio's moving into his new house. i have a weird feeling about our relationship. not a good one. he's been busy a lot lately. im gonna try to talk to hym about it cause i jusz dont learn to follo my feelings (99% of which r right).
so ne-way. on a better note. 2daii i had so much fun in skool.
in second period the teacher didnt have time to give us work cause she was dealing with 2moro's field trips so we jusz talked half of the class (Lisandra and Silvia both ended up crying over their love lives) and then in the second half a sub came in (the really funny short reffy guy) and he started laying baseball (with a rolled-up poster and paper balls) with eddie, bombillo, robert alegre, jorge, richard and all these people. it was so funny. they wud get so into and crap. and so many ppl got hit by the paper balls that somehow it jusz turned into a paper fight. and evry1 was on the floor, hiding behind desks and throwing papers and shyt (including the substitute) wen our real teacher walked in. she didnt say anything but it was so funni!
then in fourth period gio put on some pink sweat pants and started modeling and posing all sexy and shyt. and got jeremy by the back. and we took pictures of him and shwoed him to MsPino who showed em to the rest of the administration. he's so gay. u jusz gotta love him.
lunch was more idiotic shyt. im sitting ther jusz talking and some of my guy friends come and start tickling me and i fell on the floor, like slidding under the table. and luis, who was across from me at the table, got me feet, pulled out my shoes and dragged me so that i ended up laying under the tables while the security guards looked at me lyk if i was crazy. and then i cudnt stop laughing and they wudnt give me my shoes and shyt.
and afterwards wen we wer going baq 2 class ralfy goes and hugs and tight and holds me ther, along with anthony, and tayrone hit my butt so hard. and they tried it again and i jusz threw myself to the floor. but either way when we wer walking into class he did it again. n i cudnt smack him cause Mr C told me to calm down but then afterschool they did the same shyt and i kept on jusz throwing myself to the floor and sitting there until i got sick of it, stood up and slapped tayrone. i did it hard too. pobrecito. but o well. he deserbed it.
so yeah...i had to stay in skool till lyk five cause my mom was at the doctor's and then i went to teach catechism which wasnt half bad and then i watched TV and now im here and now Im gone to see ""Big Daddy"". lol. Bye Guysz!"

In first period I passed around the football and then I chilled with the football players which was EXTREMLY fun lyk always. And Barby broke a ligament. Pobrecita she cant wear heals. lol. But she gets to miss school 2 days. 
Third period was straight. Jeanette is back from Chile so it was the old group. And for some reason I could NOT stop laughing. I would jusz go and laugh, or not even laugh, jusz contract and shake as if I was laughing. It was weird, even for me, yesz..
Fifth period was same ol'. Not a bad class. I have Anisa and Javy and Seidy and Eddie and Marcus and Daniela...I have no clue why their in couples but it aint lyk that in real lyf...I think. lol. 
Nothings happened after school. I have homeword up the ass (therefo I got a *tittle*). And thats my pathetic lil lyf right ther. I might go to the Fair on friday but I'unno. O! and its Gio's sisters birthday so I get a brake cause he's with his sis.

"event","Hey guys. I haven't update in a while, sorry about that. But yeah. Wazzup? I don't feel lyk making it narrative so here are the main new things:
1. Friday I did nothing but be home and relax.
2. Saturday I went to dinner with Gio and my parents and my parents friends and we ate fried ice cream which was pretty cool and then we went to Dolphin Mall and we watched ""Miss Congeniality 2"" and my parents went into the movie with us but they sat all the way in the front and I was wearing a skirt (which Gio didn't like but w/e) so it was fun. lol. And yeah, the movie's awesome though at the beggining I really wanted to hit her for being such a plastic bitch.
3. Sunday was nothing but church and relaxing.
4. Monday school started again. I had lots of fun. I love my PE class and just my whole A Day is a trip. 
5. Today I went to the Youth Fair. That was fun. I hung out with Anisa and Vanessa and Michelle and Seidy and Eddie and ocasionally Melissa and Aida. Seidy and Eddie had their lil thing going. It was cute. And Eddie ate like a whole bucket of cheese fries and then rode on a whole buncha crazy rides but he didn't throw up. And we started a new tradition of chcolate-covered strawberries as a ritual of the Youth Fair. Aside from that we just rode a whole buncha rides and screamed our heads off and then I started a water fight which was super fun and shit. 
6. Then when we got to school the fun kinda stopped. Barby had had Vanessa's phone and found some texts and there was drama. And thank god she forgave Vanessa but yeah, it really scared me. I hope we do okay.
7. Now, on another subject, I got a new flat screen for my comp. and new tiles for when we knock down my wall. I'm now dying to get that beige been bag sofa from Dolphin Mall but ama have to wait a while.
8. I have a short story to write for Bardowell's class but it has to be a classical fairy tale so does anyone have any ideas?

Okay I'm out I'm on the phone with my baby and I don't wanna clock him out."

"event","lol. the title sounds so corny.
Well anyhoeZ, wazzup people? I'm jusz updating cause im avoiding Cuenca's hw. I'll get to it eventually I just don't feel like it now.
So yeah...
My Spring Break has been *delicious*. lol. I've had a really busy week. Yesterday I went with Gio to the fair. His sister and her husband and his parents and a friend (Shona) were also there. It was fun. His sister is pregnant [CONGRATULATIONS!!!] so she cudnt ride much, or actually anything at all, but we still had a good time. We didn't ride much so the pop-ticket was pretty much wasted but o well... We saw some shows which I didn't even know existed at the Youth Fair. It was so funny cause some girls were dancing in bikinis (representing Brazil) and Gio's mom is so jealuse his dad had to put his face down. lmfao. O! and b4 we left there was this funny-ass concert with lyk ""I Love Rock&Roll"" and ""We Will We Will Rock You!"" and ""God Bless America"". And yeah, it was a trip. I missed my ""chorus"". lol. *Luv Yu Guysz!*.
O! and aside from that Gio called Jas and told her he didn't want nothing to do with her no more. And she was crying and shit. And he said it in this weird voice. And the combo of that mixed with memories made me feel kinda bad (some poeple will understand about the *memories*) and then I also got this weird feeling that they were gonna get baq 2gether sooner or l8ter but w/e, i'm trying to block it out. 
We took a picture by the way, or a few, and Gio's gonna scan 'em so I'll post em when I get them. 
For now I'm out. I'm gonna see if we can go buy the tile for my room already (the wall is getting knocked down! woo hoo!). But I don't think so because a lot of shyt it closed cause of ""Viernes Santo"" [for those of you who didn't know why]. And yeah, if anything I'll just find something else to do while avoiding my homework till 7pm when I get to go to Gio's church and watch some movie."

I haven't updated in a while. I've been really busy lately and I've had a lot of fun. I'm not gonna make this entry super long as usual but yeah, jusz so u guysz get the idea:
On friday I went to Mainstreet, I don't remember what I did saturday and sunday. Monday I went out with Gio (for his birthday). Gary called to say happy birthday, it was pretty funny/annoying. Tuesday I spent the day at Ani's with Chad, Mely H. [her bro], Barby, Vanessa, Luis, and some other people. It was a trip. We went into the pool and had a bbq though I didn't get a tan. And I also met Jose and Camilo but I didn't get to meet Juan-Camilo so yeah... Then today I went to Pembroke Mall with Eric and Barby and Gio. By the way, Eric and Barby are now going out. Congratulation guys! And afterwards Gio came home with me and we watched movies and he just left a little while ago. And some shit happened todaii but yeah. i dont wanna talk about it.
Future plans: tomorow ama go to the Fair, Friday I'll be with Gio, Saturday I'll be with Barby and friends (I think), Sunday I'll...do something. lol, Monday its school again. Woo hoo! not!."

"event","ok guysz, last time I updated I was completely thru with Gio. But yeah, that didn't last very long. I'm sorry I'm such a flip-flopper. I think I'm worse than Kerry. But truthfully I just think I'm very easy to manipulate and it sucks so I'm begging you guysz to comment on here or IM me and tell me what you think. I don't care if it's none of your business. I want to hear from every one PLEASE. Okay, so here's what happened:
A little after we had finished everything off he called me up. He was like ""Just so you know, I'm not just gonna be okay with being friends."" And I go ""And since when do you make the decisions?"" He said since now. And then I tried to act all tough like ""O what if it's too late"" but it came out as if I were joking so yeah that really didn't work. So anyway, I asked what we were gonna do to fix things and he said not to worry about it that he'd work on it and I just let it go AGAIN. 
I kno this may sound really stupid and I honestly have no way to justify it but whatever... I'm not hurting any one and I beleive that as long as I continue to do whatever the fuck I want and not let him get to me, like I've tried to do for the past two weeks, I should be alright."

"event","0k...Gio and I are officially over. Here's what happened:
We were talking/arguing about how I never got time for him (like we have a lot lately) and then he gave me an attitude and said that now he didn't have time for me and had to go, but very rudely. So I got mad and called him up and left a message saying ""Look, I don't care if you don't got time for me, I don't care what hoe you have to call, but don't be giving me an attitude cause I don't deserve that shit. Who the fuck do you think you are?"" 
He sent me a text back that said something like ""What the fuck, where are you coming up with shyt about a hoe? Forget it, this aint worth it""
My answer was that if it wasn't worth it, then he should just call it quits.
He said if thats what I wanted, alright then
And I said that that wasn't what I wanted, just what seemed reasonable for our actions.
His only response was that I wanted to be with some other ni99a, which wasn't true, so I explained that lately every time we talked I felt like crap cause he put me entre la espada y la pared regarding my friends, or he didn't seem interested in the conversation, or I felt like he was cheating on me. 
He jusz answered and all he said was that he couldn't tell me nothing so to do whatever I wanted, but I don't get why he can't tell me nothing so I just asked...now I gotta wait. 
He said that I didn't beleive anything he said, that what did I want.
I said I wanted him to treat me like I'm worth something, to care and to talk to me instead of just getting mad.
But instead of responding to that he just popped out with some shit baout me never having time. 
And then he called, and we started arguing about that. And we just clicked cause he had to call his sister but he'll call back. 
Okay so anyway, he called back, we argued some more and we agreed to stay as friends.  End of story/ conclusion I am now completly and totally single. We're still on the phone which is funky but we're actually getting along a little better. lol. So yeah, anyway, I feel awkward. Like, I'm kinda happy, yet its weird. I dunno how to explain it. We'll see how things go. 
Alright that's all for now guysz. I'm out."

4. The show last friday (Princess Show) was real fun and had some hot guys.

6. Lisandra and Jonathan broke up (not my life but w/e)

7. I've dressed up all week long (I had lots of fun).
-on monday I had PE and forgot to bring an extra bra so I ended up having to keep my bathing suit on (it was part of my tacky outfit)
-on wednesday I had PE again, went to school in some high ass stelletos and forgot my sneakers! I had to go out on the gym floor in stelletos but then Steve gave me some socks.

8. Today I went to Westland after skool. It was a trip. Every one was there (whether thats a good or bad thing...dunno). We definetly have to plan something for the next early release.

9. I got catechism today (I gotta teach. no biggie)

ighty so anyway, to whats going on with gio. we've been talking the whole afternoon. not talking, arguing is more lyk it. first we got thru the point that he really fucked up then we got to arguing about where to go from here. he expected for sorry to be enough. he begged and he pleaded, it wasn't only sorry, pero still. he jusz wanted me to forget about it, jusz lyk that, and go out with him again. i must admit that, as stupid as i may seem for some, i considered it and it tempted me to the point where i almost gave in but then something hit me and my argument just got stronger. so i was lyk ""o, so u fuck up and then i have to do what u ask of me when u wont do what i want?"". and what i wanted was to be friends for a couple of months and for him to gain my trust back. he said he just couldn't do that and that i knew him and that he needed me but i just said that i couldn't just forget so that we were even, but he had fucked up so that meant he should be the one to fix things. i didn't give in and after lyk four hours (no exageration) he was lyk "" i can't beleive i'm saying this....i cant beleive i'm saying this!....fine...i'll wait"". i can't even explain what i felt when he said that. i got so happy. started jumping up and down inside of me. it may seem dumb to some cause it seems lyk it was only right, but, for those of u who don't know him please understand that he is not lyk this. i kno hym not only as my sweet-talking boyfriend and he is a non-caring BITCH. usually if a gurls finds out he played her he wont even say sorry, and if he does, he wont say it twice. lyk, i'm not meaning to brag and shyt because i kno that i'm probably no better than none of those gurls but the truth is something, actually a lot, in him has changed. aside from that point; i'm stupid and will forgive anyone for just about anything. just saying myself so u guysz don't feel lyk the only ones. lol. makes no sense but ok. ight i'm out, i've updated too much today. by the way: now i have the second and third tests which i'll talk about later. (1 is prom, 2 is crips; my friends should know about it). alright, luv, gaby!"

"event","t0daii we went to dolphin mall to celebrate jeanette's birthday. we were also gonna celebrate edwins but he didnt show up. so anyway, it was barby, anisa, vanessa, ralfy, jeanette, chad, lui and I. I think evryone had a really great time though after the movie ralfy seemed upset (not sure why, he wouldnt fess up). 
When we got there we talked for a while and eventually went to get our movie tickets. We got there real early (lyk before six) so we ended up getting tickets for ""Be Cool"" at seven something. Then we went to Dave & Busters. Nobody seemed to want to play, until we got the tickets that is. Then we all rran around (had to share ONE token card, lol) and played all these cool games. There were also a couple of really cute guys. It felt so weird being there by myself. Well not by myself, but with friends. Evry last time I';ve gone to Dolphin I've gone with my boyfriend, or at least my guy. And also I realized as I walked thru that I had lots of memories there. But don't get me wrong. I had a great time. I miss hanging out in a big group of idiots like that. I miss checking out every guy that passes by me just for the heck of it. I didn't hook up with anyone, nor did I want to, but jusz that feeling of freedom was awesome. And I was able to be the biggest idiot! We had an ice war and laughed LOUD AS HELL during the movie and didnt shut up, and threw popcorn at each other and anything else we could find, and pigged out (chicken tenders, quesadillas, popcorn, soda, cruncha buncha, nerds rope, cookies, nachos, u name it!) and got gay-ass ""Robot"" posters and pretended they were swords, and horsed around while running after each other thru the mall (we had a security guard following us after a while so we had to settle down), and got a piggy back ride from ralfy!, and just walked really fast thru the whole mall saying and doing w/e i wanted! it felt great!!! I'm so glad to be back to my old self. Next time I get involved in a relationship, I have to make sure to never let that go."

"event","w0w! s0 much drama has gone on lately. first was the Yas/Gary thing which i aint gonna explain. Then on Friday I was at my crib with Anisa and Gio called and he was lyk ""o u want me to click"" and i said no because there was no problem. But then he still got mad cause I click on him when I'm with Barby. We had been arguing about this for a couple of days (Barby) and he had said very rude comments that were pissing me off. I told him to move on from the topic but he kept on dropping comments, so i said i was gonna click, and he said that if i clicked to not expect to talk to him again, so i simply said that if he dropped another comment he didnt want me to talk to him ever again. and he did. so i clicked. he called me baq to say to ""never call [him] again"". and that was it, i went to catechism and came baq and after a while we started talking thru barby. he wudnt apologize for what he had done or call me. he wanted me to call him (i said i was ""following orders"" and didnt call) and implied that i shud apologize. i didnt and he finally called me and said sorry which meant a lot to me cause i kno how stubborn and cocky he is. so whatever, i got all happy, forgave him and asked him out again (he decided we had neevr stopped going out). lol. so whatever...evrythings going good. and then comes saturday.
on saturday i was with barby and i had to go get ready to go to church so i went to the bathroom while barby stayed in the room talking to gio. afterwards barby's cousin came to pick her up and i asked him (he knows a lot about cellphones) how i cud listen to previous conversations (he installed something special on my phone). so anyway, he taugh me, and since barby n gio had been talking on my phone i got it and listened to the conversation. turns out gio is talking to Yas and has been for two weeks. They've said ""I Love You"" and she is going over to his house on Spring Break (when his parents arent there). And he never told her when we got back together, nor was he planning to. This came along with a whole buncha other shyt. I wanted to cry but anger didnt let me. Later on I refused to feel bad about something in which HE messed up. So anyway, I called him, said wazzup, was all cool. Then I told him Barby's cousing had taught me how to listen to previous conversations, that I had heard it all and that he didn't have to worry about lying to Yas anymore cause it was over between us. After that he called a million times and I didn't really talk to him, just picked up a couple of times to be rude. And then, since I hadn't gotten it all out of my chest, I wrote him a really mean e-mail which I'm pretty possitive made him feel lyk crap. He continued to apologize when we talked that night and his dad tried to get me to forgive him lyk three times already. I do think I'll forgive him, but not anytime soon. My plan is to remain friends and he could work it up from the ground (with things being much different), if he wants to, and I think he does. Now, this is none of anyone's business and I kno it but I dont really give a crap cause I aint gonna be telling the story over and over again and I have to get it out of my chest somehow.
Anyway, I'm jusz bored right now. At four I'm going to Dolphin to celebrate Edwin's and Jeanette's birthday. Should be fun. Bye Guys! Luv, Gaby

I did fairly in my progress report and I just need to bring it two grades up by the report card. Today we did nothing in school (Honor Roll movie party) and it was an early release so its a pretty good day, except that I had to teach a communion class to some little kids and it drove me insane, especially cause I don't beleive in what I was teaching (saints)! Aside from that I'm cool. The head ache I got is slowly going away. Gio and I are doing great. I'm talking to Gary again. Very randomly as friends but thats exactly what I wanted. Yas keeps on calling Gio. The timing is very coinsidental and funny. We got FCAT next week. I'm scared about the science one. I went to one tutoring and I learned a lot but I still don;t thing I'll pass it. I'm just hoping that they don't use it to determine whether I pass the grade. Reading and math I should be fine with, even though Algebra is driving me up the wall. Alright well thats all I plan to type. If not i'll go into too much detail. Lov YA guys!"

<P>So anyway... we picked him up like at 6:30 i think and went to dolphin. the plan was to walk around the mall so i could look for an outfit and sneakers. DAMN WE GOT DIFFERENT TASTES! we walked around for 2 hours and couldn't find ONE item of clothing we both liked. we walked with my family a bit then we went off on our own and it was so funy cause every time he would kiss me he would look around, see if my dad was there. then after walking thru lyk all of dolphin mall we found one outfit that we could agree on! its not really my style but it is very cute. i tried on a couple of things and ended up with white brazilian capris which are pretty cute and this red shirt that says love. on of the straps of the shirt is like a belt, the other is just a half-inch strap, and the shirt ends a bit below my belly button. anyway, its cute. after buying that we went to find my shoes. i got some Lugs. Their not bad, i just dont like sneakers. </P>
<P><FONT size=4>Alright, now the part that actually matters. We finally went to the movies and we were standing outside when Jas passed by. I didn't recognize her but Gio did and he called Nicole to ask if Jas was at Dolphin mall, so I got the hint. I don't know why, I'm weird like this, but I got really mad. Its undescribable. The color got knocked out of me and my dad and step brother kept on telling me this till I went back into the bathroom and put on make-up which didn't really help. W/e we went into the movie and I was still mad so we talked about it, whcih didn't get it off my mind but at least made me feel like we had communication. <BR><STRONG>Anyway, it doesn't stop there. Then he went and he had something to tell me. I don't remember how he said it but what he told me was that the week in which he hadn't talked to me it wasn't because he was busy. It was because he didn't feel like it. He had been talking to Nicole all that week and was going to hook upp with her on firday, thats why he went out with Yanelle. However when he met her on friday and spend some time with her he realized ""he didn't love her like he loved"" me; that there was no connection. And before he left on friday, he told her he had a girlfriend and didnt want nothing going on. Then he told me he really did love me and that he was real sorry for testing our love and that he didn't wanna loose me again, that he wanted to be with me ect. <BR>I sat thru all of this, still holding his hand and restin my body on his. I was so indifferent to everything he was saying I didn't even beleive it. I had no clue what to say and I couldn't organize my thoughts enough to make out what it was I was thinking. I stayed quiet and he asked me something like ""what are you gonna say?"" I didn't know. I just stayed there staring at nothing. So he let go of my hand, pushed me away, got away and told me to think. I did... WhatI could organize was this: I was really happy he had confessed and that meant a lot to me but what he did really hurt cause I had had plenty of chances to do it to him and I hadnt even considered them. And it really sucked to not follow your instincts because you trust your boyfriend and him defy that trust. However, somehow, the trust I had in him wasn't gone. I don't know why. Maybe because he fessed up. Maybe because he's given me a second chance. But I still trusted him and forgave him. I told him all of this and then we repeatedly said ""I love you"" throughout the movie and kissed, even though my parents were in the seats in front of us and my step bro was right net to me (which made Gio go CRAZY with fear).<BR>o and by the way, we watched Coach Carter, which is an awesome movie.</STRONG></FONT><STRONG> </STRONG></P>
<P>Ok so w/e...once the movie was over we walked out. And OM HOW EMBARRASING! I had my period and I got stained. lmfao. i just&nbsp;took my step bro's&nbsp;sweater but damn it was embarrasing. o! and then I met Nicole's boyfriend,&nbsp;Josh. So yeah w/e, when I get to the car and check my cellphone I had 9 missed calls, some of which were from Gary (Gio's reaction I'll leave to the imagination). He was going to be at Dolphin yesterday, so that makes me afraid he saw me, even tho i didn't see him. I tried calling back then and not so long ago but he doesn't pick up so w/e. </P>
<P>Alright that all for now. Feel free to comment but try to be polite if ur gonna butt into my relationship, especially if ur one of the people I don't really know. </P>

"event","Ighty, starting by yesterday.
Yesterday was alright and the really good aprt was that I finally seriously talked to gio. I think it was effective cause things got better today but from how he acted in the afternoon...??? I guess I'll have to wait some more and see cause he's groudned and we haven't really gotten a chance to talk lately.
Today was alright as well. I went to the prom meeting afterschool. I have a feeling I'm not going to like how the prom is going to turn out. Most people want this big old thing like if it was our twelve grade prom and I don't like all of that but at the end of the day I don't really give a fuck so I'v decided to support whatever they want. 
Family day is this saturday and I'm going to get my report card. Now that I talk about it, I wonder if I can get Gio to come with me. Doubt it but I'll try. O! and Anisa got operated today. It all went well, thank god. And she's home already. O yeah, and even though its kinda late
CONGRATULATIONS TO MELISSA G. AND DANNY!!!!!! YOU GUYS MAKE THE CUTEST COUPLE AND IM REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU. I HOPE YOU LAST A REALLY LONG TIME CAUSE YOU HAVE A BEUTIFUL, INTELLECTUAL RELATIONSHIP AND THATS WHAT COUNTS. LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!"

"event","0MFG i just had half my entry done and it all erased! fuck! now I gotta type everything all over again.

Anyway, I was saying that sorry I hadn't updated in so long. A lot of shit has happened since I last updated but I'm just gonna outline some of it cause I don't have that much time. 

1. The weekend after my granmom passed away I went to a Christian concert where an old abuelita sang and reminded me of my own. Thats when it hit me she had passed away and I broke down. I don't want to think about it though; I just hope she's peacefully in heaven and I have faith that she is. The whole concert wasn't sad though. After I got over that issue Gio and I sat in the back with some of his friends. I'll leave what happened to your imagination but I will say that it was really embarasing cause we had a priest in front of us and he called our attention a couple of times. He looked like he was gonna explode too. hahaha. 

2. Last weekend I went to New York. It is such A BEUATIFUL CITY! I went for five days and saw a lot of it so I aitn gonna go into details about it. I also met an old relative of mine. She was really cool and she was a painter. She let Barby, my mom, boobo and I pick out some of her paintings to take home and now we just gotta put them up. The trip wasn't that great cause I got in really big arguments with my parents and actually it was hell for the first two days but w/e...I can;t be ungreatful.

3. The relative that I met in New York is in intensive care since Tuesday cause of I don't know what.

4. My mom has a horrible food intoxication and is full of red bumps.

5. Friday was awesome. I went to a drumline show/thing @ HML. I LOVE THAT SCHOOL. I went with Vanessa and Yanelly. We had tons of fun. Only one aspect cagged it for me and that was Gio but it isn't worth mentioning in this spot cause it'll cag the whole point that friday was AWESOME.

6. NOW to Gio. We've been growing apart and I don't know why. Ever since friday he's back to talking (not hooking up talking, just talking) to some female named Mayen who likes him. They went out on friday with Janel, Hector, Jovy and Marcos and I'm really scared I might have gotten played. I do trust Gio no matter what evry1 says but I also gotta be realistic. Another thing is that he's been like real ""busy"" lately. Its pissing me off, I guess I'll have to find a solution to it soon but I don't want nobody leaving lil comments ""girl I think he's playing you"" or ""you gotta brake up with him"" because as much as I love all of ya'll and appreciate your opinion at the end of the day I'm the only one that knows him as good as I do. 

7. Anisa's getting her knee operated on Wednesday so yeah...lets pray that all goes well.

8. Im trying to make it so that next saturday a whole buncha people go to mainstreet like it used to be so please SPREAD THE WORD.

I think thats all for now. I'll keep on updating regularly. I gotta go do Bardowell's essay. Peace!"

"event","I can't complain about my New Year's Eve. At seven we went to out back with my dad, step mom, gio, gio's parents and a whole buncha their friends. We weren't allowed to drink (underage) and Gio kept on dying to know about the football game (Gators vs. Canes) but from there on we had a good time. It was pleasent and we held hands in front of my parents. hahahaha. Then Gio realized we were holding hands in front of our parents and flipped. It was HILARIOUS. And our parents also got together to go fishing tonight at Key Largo. That should be fun. *hint* Lots of bushes *hint*. hahaha. Im a sicko but thats ok.
Afterwards we went to the service at his church which was really good. I had a lot to thank god for (especially for Gio being off drugs and all of that). At twelve we threw fireworks and danced (at the church), or at least I did, he wouldn't. The fireworks were hilarious. He got this big old firework thing that ur supposed to put on the ground and he just held it and lit it and started dancing with it. Him and Dany, of course, had to do the ""parking lot"" ""A- town stomp"" ""Rockaway"" and evry other step...it was pretty funny. 
After the service he went to a friends party and I came to my mom's crib and drank pina coladas and ate my twelve grapes (even if it was too late).
Well that was all for yesterday, I haven't talked to Gio today (I think he's still sleeping) but I'm dying to go fishing with him already."

Some one stole it and now Im in DEEP shyt. My mom is basically not wanting 2 look @ me. I cud c she wants 2 kill me in her eyes. She's freaking scaring me. And booboo, who neva gets mad, got mad! I don't even wanna think of my dad. I'v already broken his digital camara and lost 6 cell phones. Im sooooooooo freaking irresponsible. Please nobody tell me it. I'v had it.

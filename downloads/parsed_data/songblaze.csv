"event","So I just realized I never updated you guys on the methotrexate experiment.

I've been on it for 7 months now.  It's been a bit of a mixed bag.  The side effects have been low, but I'm torn as to whether it's doing enough to make things better (or whether I need something else added to it).

I'm definitely not thrilled with how easily I get sick.  My other half has to wash his hands as soon as he gets home (which maybe helping - it's now been 3 weeks without me getting sick, which is about average, so we'll see if this does in fact give me more un-sick time).  At least so far, it's been colds and sinus and ear infections, so nothing really out of the ordinary for me, just the frequency has been unusual (and my reaction to the ear infection - I ended up in urgent care because I was literally falling out of chairs because I was so violently dizzy).

Other than that, the side effects have been minimal.  I sometimes get a very mildly lightheaded after the injection, for up to 2 hours.  I occasionally have pretty mild lower GI effects, but that's unusual.  It has actually made my IBS issues less problematic.

I'm still flaring after I get sick.  When I'm not flaring, I'm in a good bit less pain, especially in my hands, feet, and knees.  It's weird, because it became the new normal very quickly, so that it feels very painful now when I flare and end up back where I started more or less.  Mental clarity is better, too.  Oh, and my liver enzymes, which were mildly elevated before starting methotrexate, are now a very low, healthy number.  This is especially good considering that the liver enzymes rising is one of the negative side effects they watch for (and potentially have to pull you off methotrexate).

Still not back to myself.  I'm hoping that being more vigilant about hand washing will be enough to keep me from getting sick and flaring and being in pain for a couple weeks.  If that does do the trick, we'll know soon whether we need to fiddle with the dose more or add a second medication.  I believe I'm currently taking a relatively high amount of methotrexate, so I think that adding a second med will probably be the next step if we do decide that things aren't working out.

On the whole, things are better than they were before the medications.  I just hate that I have to be so paranoid about germs!"

"event","Right, so I finally have a rheumatologist who is taking my condition seriously.  It's still undifferentiated connective tissue disorder, but she doesn't want it running amok.  I can't say I think much of my last rheum who threw up his hands when I failed Plaquenil.  It did terrible things to my stomach, where I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach if I ate or drank anything, or if I waited too long to eat or drink anything.  Bloody miserable.

So now I start Methotrexate injections next Friday.  They're set up at the infusion center, so I'm not 100% clear on whether I'm getting an injection or an infusion (the difference being whether one needs to sit and take it IV or whether one just gets a shot).

Regardless, I've been reading up on methotrexate a bit, and I'm far from thrilled.  The profile of side effects is pretty daunting.  But on the other hand, as I am, I'm doing jack.  So if I can have my hands and my back and my goddamn BRAIN back, I can have more of a life.  Right now, really all I do is putter on the internet, watch TV, and knit.  That's great with that big ol' brain and that JD I worked so damn hard to get.  Not to mention all the debt that comes with said JD.  So I'm hoping that this works.  I just...I guess looking at the list of side effects has me feeling a bit like I wish I hadn't wished for it, you know?  I knew methotrexate was the next step.  I know the step after that (if this one fails) has even scarier side effects, if this doesn't work.  I know that from here on out, I'm compromising my immune system to try to tame it.  It's just a daunting set of side effects.  And I get to start the whole thing in a week."

"event","I don't know how many of you know this, but I love perfume oils, mostly from Black Phoenix Alchemy Labs.  I got introduced to them by a friend a decade ago, and have collected them ever since.  I had 20-25 bottles and over 200 small vials (at a guess).

Because I was flying out to CA, and TSA is so finicky about liquids, I packed my 3 boxes of perfume up with other heat sensitive things (LUSH massage bars, a bucket of shea butter, my essential oils, so on).  My fiance was supposed to bring it in the car so that it didn't have to be shipped in the moving container, which was likely to see quite a bit more heat than the inside of a car with air conditioning.  I left 2 days before he did, because that was a convenient day for me to fly.

Unfortunately, the last day of the move was complete chaos - my fiance and my father weren't even able to get all of our furniture and whatnot cleared out of the unit.  And my basket, which had all my perfume and whatnot?  My fiance forgot to bring that basket.  He compounded the error by emailing the landlord that they could get rid of the things in the apartment.  By the time I knew the basket hadn't made it out of the apartment, it had been disposed of.

I found a place where I can get the one I was most destroyed about losing, because I wore it on a number of dates early in my relationship with the fiance, including our first date.  I associate the scent of Hunger Moon with the effervescent feeling of an infatuation that has become a deep and abiding love.

I'm still pretty upset about the rest of it, though.  At a very rough guess, I must have paid something like $600 or more for my perfumes, and some of them have only increased in value since then as they became rarer (though I think most have been pretty stable in value).

It's going to take me a long time to build up my collection, and it's going to be hard and expensive to find some of the rarer scents.  I'm very unhappy about the situation, but I don't want to make the fiance feel too bad about it - he takes things very hard when he makes a mistake that upsets me.  It's going to take me years to gather up a similar collection.  I'm feeling deeply disheartened.

I know it seems like a shallow thing, but our sense of smell is tied surprisingly tightly to our emotional state, and to our memories.  That's why smelling your grandma's cookie recipe over the holidays takes you back to when she was there, or why the scent of chlorine reminds you of summers spent in the pool with your childhood friends.  And for me...it's one of the very few ways I get to feel 'pretty' anymore.  I mean, I don't hate my body, but I don't feel attractive like I used to when I was younger and thinner.  And living in a disabled body only makes it harder to feel attractive, because there is such a pervasive social message about how ugly and awful disability is.  I can't wear most conventional perfumes; many give me trouble breathing, others give me terrible headaches.  So being introduced to BPAL was exciting.  And now my whole collection is gone.  The scents I use to relax and help me get to sleep, the ones that make me feel powerful and feisty, the ones that make me feel sexy, the playful ones, the ones that help me concentrate...they're all gone.

I hate moving."

"event","The last month and a half has been kind of unbelievable.  I know there's that expression about things coming in threes; well, it was finally a GOOD three.

I had my Commencement at the end of May.  My family flew out, the commencement was really nice.  I unfortunately picked up a bug there that meant I didn't get to see my family much for the rest of the time they were here, which kind of sucked, but I was still happy about graduating.  Multiple professors, and two deans (dean of the law school and the dean of students) both stopped me to say they were glad I'd made it through, and glad I'd come out for graduation.

I was the last person to walk across the stage.  As I walked off, I punched the diploma up in the air, and everyone cheered.  IDK if it was just grads celebrating, or if it was people who liked a show of triumph/spirit from a grad, or if people saw the dog and figured that I'd had a hard time of it, but it felt damn good and almost had me in tears.

Shortly after that, the fiance (who is a math professor) got the call that he'd gotten the tenure-track job he'd been waiting to hear from.  He's been applying for tenure-track jobs for the past 4 cycles, and this was the last one we could afford (financially) for him to do without getting a non-academic job.  I don't know what we were going to do if he didn't get this job - I think both of us kind of stopped thinking about it and held our breath once he got the interview, and then got the second interview.  Wonder of wonders, his new employer will give me health insurance without us being married - we just have to be 'domestic partners', which in the great state of CA doesn't mean gay (because people who are gay can get married).  It just means people who have lived together >1 yr, are romantic partners, and intend to continue with that situation, which pretty well applies to us, as we've been engaged for 2 years now.  Oh yeah, and they'll pay him about $10k more than anyone else has paid him to date, so we can comfortably live on it even in a moderately expensive city.

And the job?  It's back home.  San Diego.  We've had this goal of getting back to So Cal for years now, but it's always been a 'when fiance's job allows'.  We knew it might be a decade before we managed it.  I haven't lived in the city, but my grandparents have had a house there as long as I can remember.  I like San Diego, though I don't know it especially well.  I mostly know nice places to eat and the big entertainment places everyone knows about (the world-famous zoo, the Wild Animal Park, Sea World, etc), but not much more than that.  It's not the little gem of a city by the sea that holds my heart (Santa Barbara), but it's back in a climate that doesn't screw with me and near family, including my nephew.  I'll finally be able to go out to his birthday parties, and know I'll see him at either Thanksgiving or Christmas.  I'll be able to take the train up and see my parents when I want to.  I won't have an excuse for avoiding Thanksgiving with dad's family, but hey, nothing's perfect.

There are some troubles coming, of course - the cost of a trans-continental move, my fiance and my dad and the pet dog going on a cross-country road trip because it's so damn expensive to get dog and car moved, having to replace all of my doctors (the GP and the pain specialist are the ones I worry about the most, everyone else I have on my dance card is pretty routine or they've taken care of the big issues), and oh yeah, deciding what to pack, what to leave, and getting it all packed.  But still - the big things?  The big things are good."

I like to think that on the whole, I am not a particularly vain woman.  Sure, I love my pretty clothing, and excuses to get dressed up, but I really don't spend a whole lot of time or energy on my appearance.  I don't wear makeup, and while my hair is now very long, I don't do a whole lot with it, just stick it up in a simple bun.

I got quite a shock today.  I've been very much under the weather - had to increase my prednisone dose on Thursday and again on Sunday because I was just swelling and swelling and in a huge amount of pain.  So I've been spending even less time and energy on my appearance than usual.

I was washing my hands after using the restroom at my physical therapist's when I looked in the mirror.  Oh. My. God.  My face is ROUND.  It's all puffy and...agh.  I look like I've very suddenly put on a huge amount of weight.  I almost didn't recognize myself.

I'm trying not to think too much about it, but I really am pretty upset.  I mean...my FACE.  My fucking FACE.  AGH.

Yet another reason to want off the damn prednisone.  As if I didn't have enough already.  I really, really, really hope that the rheumatologist has some ideas on treating this more directly tomorrow, so we can attack the cause of the swelling instead of just racing to try to keep up with it."

After the whole thing with the back brace throwing my whole back into spasm, I saw someone in the same-day clinic at my doctor's office.  She was very nice and gave me exactly what I came in asking for - a muscle relaxant and another trip to physical therapy.  Yesterday was my first day of physical therapy, and things are Not Good.  I think it's partly that we were just a bit too aggressive.  What happened is that the edge of one of the rigid parts in the brace seems to have caused a tension issue with the paraspinal muscles between T7 and T9 (so starting roughly even with the bottom of my shoulder blades and extending down two vertebrae).  That meant that most of what needed to be done was mobilizing the vertebrae, which is uncomfortable at best when things work up this tight.

Unfortunately, this is not an 'at best' situation.  The other part of the issue right now is that my autoimmune thing is continuing to get worse, including in my spine.  I don't know if I'm just developing a tolerance to prednisone very fast indeed (which is totally a possibility - I develop tolerances extremely quickly, and to medications that most people don't, like stomach acid medications and non steroidal anti-inflammatories and I'm spacing on the other weird one I acclimate to), or if my immune system is just attacking harder.  I feel like I may be starting to come down with a cold, so it's also possible that I caught something and THAT is what's making things worse.  Anyhow, the primary places this stuff affects are my hands and my back, so it's adding to the problem.  I feel like shit.  I don't have time for this.  I couldn't make it to class tonight because I didn't think I could sit in the car for long enough to go to school without being in screaming pain.

Stupid body.  Why do you treat me like this?"

"event","So, as some of you may know, I am a big fan of Matt Bomer (actor, plays the ex-conman on White Collar).  I think he is positively delicious; I'd probably rate him the most attractive man I've ever seen.

Anyhow, I came across a movie, Magic Mike, that included him as part of the cast.  The critics seemed to like the movie, so I watched it tonight.  It was so incredibly meh that I don't even know what to say.  The story went almost nowhere, imo.  The only real attraction to the movie was seeing a lot of some very pretty men.  I'll admit, I was not in the slightest averse to seeing some of these pretty men, most especially Matt Bomer, of course.  But it was a bit of a let-down.  I want a bit more story to go with my pretties, thanks.

(Incidentally, wtf is it with me and swooning over gay actors?  Matt Bomer and Sean Maher are two of my faves to look at - they're so damn pretty!  And yeah, as I'll never meet them much less have the experience of making a pass at them, on some level it doesn't matter that they're both gay and have partners and children with those partners.  All the same, some part of me feels just a smidge disappointed to find out that they're gay.  Nothing rational about it, and I don't have that outlook that it's some kind of loss to womankind that they prefer men, just that strange little let-down feeling.  Kind of like finding out that someone you find very attractive is exclusively attracted to uber-outdoorsy Amazons when you're a petite scholarly type, I suppose.)"

"event","So I was able to confirm that yes, the lab either lost or forgot to do the blood tests that my rheumatologist ordered.  I had them run this past Friday, and I now have the results.  Everything turned up normal, so whatever I have, I have a sero-negative version of.  That means that I have the condition but for one reason or another my blood work doesn't reflect that - it's not terribly unusual, but it makes it harder to figure out precisely what I have.  A great many doctors start brushing you off at that point, unfortunately.  Before these tests, the rheumatologist was quite sure there was something auto-immune going on, and I can only hope that he continues to have confidence in that, because otherwise I have no real treatment options.  The fact that I am responding positively to steroids, and have a positive ANA and both physical and blood evidence of inflammation helps.  I suppose I should try to get the ultrasound of my hands done, though I am not certain of its usefulness with the steroid reducing inflammation.  If they want me to go off the steroids for a few days to let them swell back up, that will suck, but I suppose I'll have to make it work.  Ugh.

In the meantime, the inflammation is back up somewhat, and the pain is up again.  I can't help but mentally fuss over the whole thing - I mean, I've been really hurting and using a lot of the use of my hands and feet and back for several months now.  Anyhow, I have my appointment with my rheumatologist next month (I want to say it's in about 2 weeks), so I am really trying to mentally back-burner that until I see him.  I think perhaps I'll call tomorrow and point out that they have the blood work and see if he wants me to start on something new before the appointment so maybe we can evaluate it then, or if he wants me to just continue on as I am until I see him.

In other news, I finally got the back brace my doctor wanted me to have.  Now, with any new brace, you have what is called a 'wear in' period or schedule.  The idea is that you start wearing it for a small amount of time - typically an hour - and then increase how much you wear it by a small amount every day until you're wearing it as long as your doctor wants.  I could feel that it was shifting my posture pretty significantly (but in a good way!  It felt 'right' but not normal, if that makes sense), so I decided to be cautious and only wore it for 40 minutes.  That evening, I got really nasty pain and muscles spasms around a couple of my thoracic vertebrae (so pretty much right around the spine at about the middle of it).  It very quickly spread to my whole back.  Ugh.  I did all of my stretches and using heat and massage and that wasn't helping much, so I went to the doctor and got muscle relaxants to add in to the mix, plus a referral back to my physical therapist.  At this point, the hope is that working with him will improve my back enough that I can wear the brace and it'll do its job - keeping my posture correct to prevent a lot of my chronic back pain.  If that doesn't work, well, I'm not sure what the next step is.  If this brace works, it could stop a lot of my back injuries, so it's definitely worth futzing with.

I guess that's the state of things.  Oh.  And yet another one of the shows I've been watching added a rape storyline.  This makes 3 I've run across in less than a month.  Walking Dead had a very overtly threatened and nearly consummated rape line, Downton Abbey had one, and now The Grand.  This one, at least, didn't hit me as hard.  Part of it, I think, is that the character it happened to was less likeable, less relatable, so it didn't feel as personal.  As much as I hate spoilers, I am beginning to think that perhaps I should adopt my friend's suggestion of reading them so I know it's coming.  Then I can choose when I watch them (ie, not as the last show before I intend to go to bed!), and knowing it's coming can make it less triggering.  Still.  Ugh.  Why do they need these rape storylines?  They have so many other things to work with."

There is a couple on the show that is really...cute together.  They're sweet and lovey, and they managed to make it through him being jailed for around a year because his ex framed him for murder.  They're people you like and root for, and they make it through and are so very happy together.

And then, the episode I was just watching, she gets raped by another man.  A guy who'd been flirting with her, and who the husband had been jealous about.  And at least at this point, she's trying to hide it from him because she believes he'll kill the guy.  And I just...it just...

Gah.  My chest is so tight it hurts, and my throat hurts, and there is this pit in my stomach.  I was expecting to just have...I don't know, the usual enjoyable relaxing episodes, watch a couple of them and then head off for bed, nice and peaceful.

I had a really NICE weekend, and it just pisses me off that they've gone and ruined my Sunday night like this.  I'm upset enough that I'm pretty sure it's going to trip my insomnia, and I feel like crap, and I just...I just wanted to enjoy my show.

I really wish that people would use rape as a plot device a little less.  I get that they want to give us some drama in this relationship, because it's so good and they're so cute together, but...why couldn't the whole flirting/jealousy thing be enough?"

"event","So I had blood tests run almost a month ago.  I came in with two sets that needed to be run: some for my GP and some for my rheumatologist.  I'm always kind of distracted at these appointments, what with the phobia of needles and all.  I did notice that it didn't seem like they had drawn enough vials of blood, so I paused on my way out and asked to make certain they had taken everything they needed.  The person at the front said that the person who drew my blood had all the paperwork, so it was all done.  I really should have gone back to the phlebotamist herself and asked.

Yeah.  They didn't do one set.  The currently more important set that relates to my auto-immune disorder.  Which means I've been delayed a month, and stuck on a nasty drug that creates dependency over time (prednisone).  I want off of it, because the side effects are miserable.  I have hot flashes all the time, sweat like I'm running a marathon, and yesterday I lost my temper so badly at Chris that he was afraid to come home.  And that loss of temper?  It was because he didn't know what he'd done with the spare towels, and I needed one to dry my hair.  I was ready to throw things, and yelling, and I can't remember the last time I was so angry.  Over a fucking towel.

So tomorrow, we call the rheumatologist and ask for a new slip, and hopefully I get my blood drawn Friday.  It's a big inconvenience, not to mention that blood draws are kinda traumatic because of the whole phobia thing.  This really sucks.

A little over a week from now, I finally get to see a friend I haven't seen in AGES.  Sadly, he's here the same weekend I'm hosting someone I know from online.  She found out about Hudson's service dog program from me, and she just got a dog from there herself this summer because of my recommendation.  You don't see many schools who have placed dogs with people who have EDS, so she decided it was a good match.  So far, it sounds like things are going well for her, and she's here for the required graduate classes. I'll be glad to finally meet her in person, but playing host means less ability to see my friend.  A'course, he's got a load of plans that weekend, so I suppose we wouldn't've been able to see much of each other anyhow, but some part of me is annoyed that the universe plotted things this way all the same.  C'est la vie, I guess."

"event","So, as of this past Wednesday, I officially have 'some kind of auto-immune disorder'.

I'm still trying to work out how I feel about it.  To be honest, mostly exasperated and annoyed that it took this long.  The majority of the symptoms that are attached to this - pain, swelling, skin problems, irritation in the eyes and nose and sinuses, etc - have been around for 2 1/2 years at this point.  This is the first time that the tests have shown a positive for autoimmune disorders, but it's well known that one can have an autoimmune disorder without having positive blood tests (which is known as being 'sero-negative').  Well, rather, they now have a blood test that shows it's autoimmune; there have been tests all along that show that there was an inflammatory process going on.  There is a part of me that feels like someone really should have figured out that something was going on before now, and done something to help me instead of leaving me with nothing but an increase in opioids to try to deal with this.

Things did abruptly get worse last weekend, so it's not like things have been steady.  I was very swollen, particularly in the hands, when I went in for my appointment with the rheumatologist.  Because I finally (FUCKING FINALLY!) have a condition that fits in his area of specialty, I now have medication that is helping somewhat with the swelling and pain (prednisone, which is also known as 'Satan's tick-tacks' and similar things, because of all the fun side effects that come with it).  I want to eat all the things and drink a lake, and I feel like I'm burning up sometimes, but I guess on the whole it's still a net improvement by some measure.  The prednisone doesn't directly treat the condition, it just keeps a lid on the inflammation, which is part of what causes the pain.

Anyhow, I'm still trying to...adjust, I guess?...to someone actually finding SOMETHING that explains all of this.  I'm torn between hope that it means they'll be able to do something serious about treating this and my quality of life will improve dramatically and despair that I have yet another condition that'll follow me for the rest of my life and of course it's another one that is a bit unpredictable about how badly you're affected at any one time, which makes planning and, y'know, having a life harder.  A friend of mine had been certain that I just had a case of Lyme disease that was treatment resistant, but having this test turn up positive rules that out pretty effectively.  It's frustrating, because some little part of me was still hoping that they just needed to figure out what was going on and they'd be able to treat it and make it go away forever.  I think some part of you always hopes that, when you have an undiagnosed chronic condition.

Perhaps the worst part is that there is some chance that what's been going on for over 6 years now has all been this auto-immune disorder at a sub-clinical level.  In other words, all of the pain and fatigue and mental issues and whatnot could very well have been this same thing, just at a level where it couldn't be found via blood tests.  If that turns out to be the fact - if I am radically returned to close to my former health - I will be both deeply angry and deeply joyous.  Angry that it would have taken over 6 years for someone to figure this out and get me the medication I need; joyous to have a return to that former self, someone who might be able to have a life that includes a full-time job and dancing and social outings, perhaps even rock-climbing and horseback riding and skiing if I'm careful about the fragile joints.  More time and energy to put into the things I love and my relationships.  The possibility has me feeling almost nauseous just typing this out, because it is so thrilling that it turns my stomach upside-down. 

I had more tests run on Friday to try to narrow down specifically what kind of auto-immune disorder I have; once they do that, I suppose we get to start with the drugs to treat whatever-it-is, most of which are immunosuppressants to one degree or another.  I suppose that only makes sense when you know you're talking about the immune system going haywire, but that doesn't make the fact any more appealing.  I am already frightfully susceptible to the minor infections that float around everywhere, and get harder by them than anyone I know.  The idea of having my woefully ineffectual immune system being deliberately weakened is somewhat frightful."

I guess the thing about being serious about your prep work is that you can manipulate the fuck out of the other people in the exercise.  I think I mentioned that it was a divorce w/ children?

We did about what I'd expect on custody, which went to 60/40 roughly.  Given that the party I rep'd hadn't lived in the home for the last 14 months, I think that was actually a pretty good result.

She got the house, which was damn near a given, as he makes 3 times what she does and is able to do that because he went to school while she was supporting him for the most part.  Yeah, he's got some student loans, but still.  She took all of their debt - both the mortgage and their credit card debt.  He got ALL the other property - furniture, cars, even HER pension.

I had pointed out that property distribution and alimony are both there to balance out income difference...so I told them, if you take the house, you get NO alimony.

And that's what happened.

While that may not sound like much, well, anyone who's taken family law and really looked at this sort of stuff would be able to tell you that I rocked the fucking house.  And what we ended up with?  Yeah, I had team-mates, but for the most part it was me rather firmly negotiating with opposing counsel.  I just pointed out to my team before we started things like...oh, she inherited a cabin but he got student loans, so their positions on non-marital property was as big as the net value of the marriage assets/debts, so we could make a case for a 50/50 property distribution.

I think I brought my client out circa $45,000 ahead of where he should have been, if not more.

We're negotiating a divorce with children, so that means the divorce itself, property division, alimony, and child support.  I went into this thinking that my assigned 'client' didn't have a good chance of getting what he wanted, but the more I think about it, the more likely it seems to me that he may get most of what he wants, if I play my cards right.  I think I may also be able to get him to accept the point I can't win on if I get a condition I like attached on it (that is to say, I think we'll end up with him paying more alimony than he wants, but we might be able to get the other side to agree that the amount is contingent on her going back to school and finishing her bachelor's degree, with a lesser amount if she doesn't go back to school).

"event","Okay, so you guys were all here a couple months ago, when I mentioned the fight with the landlord about whether or not we could stay.

Immediately after that, they said a rent check didn't arrive from us.  Now, Chris was sending it using online payments at his bank, so there is a small chance there was an issue with that (the way it works is you set up the payment online, the bank withdraws the money from your account, and sends the check where you said to).  But the bank said the check was sent, and sent to the right address.

We grumbled, and we sent them a new check, which included a $50 late fee.

Last month, the check arrived just fine - Chris is sending them physical checks again, because we didn't want to risk the issue being the bank.

This month, the landlord said the check didn't arrive again.  Chris sent them a new check today, again including a $50 late fee.

I'm just a little suspicious that something else is going on here.  Obviously for the future, we can protect ourselves by sending the checks via certified mail.  What I'm wondering is if there's any way to prove the earlier issues were not our fault.  I'm suspecting malice on the part of the landlord here; they were PISSED when their lawyer said we were right, and we got to stay.  2 out of 3 checks disappearing mysteriously in the 2 months after the conflict just smells fishy to me.

Any ideas on what we can do (besides, as I said, sending them certified in the future so we have proof of mailing)?  Yeah, we can probably prevent this from happening in the future, but is there anything we can do about two checks they claim never arrived?"

It makes it difficult for me to do basic, necessary things like...shower, because we don't have central air and the bathroom was a late add-on so it's outside of the original exterior wall of the house and thus much less insulated, so it freezes in the winter and roasts in the summer.  Seriously, we have to keep the bathroom door closed most of the year because otherwise it has bad affects on the rest of the house's temperature.

I really hate this.

Also, poor Hudson is recovering from an ear infection that turned into way more drama than expected.  We tried to treat it with leftover meds from last time, because he gets frequent yeast infections, but when it was clear after 2-3 days that THAT wasn't helping, we took him to the vet and found out he had a bacterial infection.  They gave us new ear drops, and he reacted to them, causing the inside of his ear to become horribly inflamed, itchy, and painful.  He made himself cry while playing, because any touch hurt.  We called the vet and the vet decided it was a secondary yeast infection, stopped the antibiotic drops and gave us a new bottle of the yeast med.  After 2 days on that, with him getting worse (because he was so inflamed that anything else topical was just compounding things), we got him back in with the vet.  He's now on oral antibiotics (because the bacterial infection hadn't been wiped out and rebounded BIG TIME with the stopping of the topical antibiotic and the open inflammation) and prednisone.  The prednisone is making him drink a ton, and yesterday I lost track of how long it'd been since I let him out and he ended up peeing on the kitchen floor.  The whole thing is just a horrid mess to deal with, and I'm really sick of it, and I'm sure he's a whole lot sicker of it than I am.  His ear is, at least, recovering admirably.  I can still see healing inflammation and angryness, but it's much improved and he's no longer crying every time his ear is touched.  Which is good, because we have to clean his ear every day to help get rid of the infection, and there is little that makes you feel like shit the way holding down a crying animal to clean an infected, inflamed area, and knowing that you're causing his pain and can't explain that this is helping.  All the worse because he's really pitiful and doesn't resist much until he's crying in pain, and then he just tries to shrink away.

All in all, so far, this summer sucks.  And with how hot it is already, I suspect it is going to continue sucking for a good many more months.  Blah.

At least I'll be spending 3 weeks out in much-less-humid So Cal and NorCal this summer with my parents.  Also, my sister is supposed to be working two jobs, so hopefully I will hardly see her at all, and can spend good quality time with my parents and my nephew.  Astonishingly, my mother thinks it's unreasonable that I can't have a relationship with someone who thinks people who are disabled 'and don't contribute' should be humanely killed to help with the overpopulation issue.

Um.  No.  I can't have a good relationship with a person I already didn't like much who has decided that people LIKE ME should be killed because our world population is soaring and causing severe environmental degradation.  The idea that somebody - not her, but somebody- should kill people for something that is intrinsic about them, that they have absolutely no control over, is deeply fucked up.  And particularly when that's aimed at me and people like me, I'm not going to be okay with the person saying it."

I responded to the first round of antibiotics, which is mostly a good thing - it means it's an infection rather than a chronic unfixable thing (and those were basically the options at that point).  The bad news is that the first round, while it made me feel worlds better and dramatically decreased swelling in lots of joints, didn't actually finish off the infection.  Within a couple of weeks, I was back to square one.  They have me on a second course of the same for now, but I'm going to have a PICC put in (a central line that stays in for a while - so basically, a thin line that'll go in my arm to just above my heart) and then I'll get 2 weeks of IV antibiotics.

We just went through the academic job season without Chris being offered a post.  This is seriously bad news.  The only upside is that his department where he is now didn't have a successful candidate search, so he may be offered a renewal of his one-year position.  It at least gives us time.

Our landlord just told us they're going to sell the house.  Thank god the lease is written the way it is - they had to give us notice by the end of February or our contract automatically renewed for a year starting May 1, which means we have a right to lease this place until April 30, 2013.  They can either sell the house encumbered, which means that the buyer becomes our new landlord, or they can buy us out of the lease.

So now I'm doing research on what a lease is worth.  Bleh.

So I asked Chris's sister in law if she used fabric pads for herself, thinking that if they were so gung-ho about the diapers, she might (or might be interested).  Her reaction totally cracked me up - she looked completely revolted by the idea and said very firmly that she wasn't interested.

Apparently cleaning poopy diapers is cool, but getting a bit of blood off of pads is a whole different ballgame.  I totally don't get it - I would go the other way, I think.  Picking up after the dog is bad enough, I don't want to have to get poop out of fabric.  At least with the fabric pads, you can just leave them alone until you throw them in the washing machine as long as you don't mind the possibility of staining.  With the diapers, you really have to remove poop first.  Yuck."

"event","On top of everything else, I now have 'arthritis of some kind'.  We don't know what's causing the arthritis, the most common causes have (probably) been put out of the running by negative bloodwork, and it's pretty bad.  Right now, it's attacking virtually every joint in my body, including my spine.  I have a couple of blood tests I need done to eliminate other possible causes, and an x-ray of my spine to see if it's affecting the bones there yet.  An ultrasound of my hands showed that it has affected literally every joint in both hands, some worse than others.

I'm in constant pain even though we've increased my pain meds by half.  The pain is making me hold myself more stiffly and not move correctly, which is causing increasing muscle pain.  The worst of that is happening in my back because of past injuries.  I start physical therapy to help with the muscle side of things on Thursday; maybe if I'm lucky and get a new prescription, they can help me with the arthritis-stuff too.  For reasons that haven't exactly been made clear to me - maybe it's the arthritis, maybe it's the way my body reacts when I don't have conscious control of it - I wake up with my muscles incredibly stiff and painful every morning.  It takes 1 1/2-2 hours to get through the worst of that.

This 'arthritis of some kind' has been going on since MARCH.

Mentholated creams help a little (but stink a lot, so I can't put them on if I'm not going to take a shower between when I put them on and when I'm next due in class).  Heat helps a little, but because I have POTS, my body loses its ability to effectively control its temperature when I'm in pain, so I overheat and chill extremely easily, which means I have to be careful applying heat.  I do, after all, prefer not to faint or collapse.  Physical therapy will definitely help with the muscle pain in my back, neck, hips, and shoulders, but I worry about how it'll work with the arthritis.  Ah well, I'm sure that they've dealt with people who have muscle injuries + arthritis before, and I'm seeing the guy I've seen for the past 3 1/2 years for my back, so I do at least know he's very good at both massage and listening.

I am missing about half of my classes, and doing abysmally at keeping up.  If Chris hadn't bought me a new, lighter laptop in early September, I wouldn't have been able to make another chunk of the classes (or rather, it would have been more-or-less worthless to go).  Even doped out of my mind, I can take dictation well, so when they first raised my pain meds and I couldn't think, I just sat in class and took it down as dictation.  Still do that on days when the pain is bad, because I can't always get coherent thought out.  Definitely not getting a distinguished class performance this semester!

Ye gods.  I just hope I don't fail anything.  My professors have been sympathetic, so far, and have done what they can to help.  I just have to keep trying to keep my feet under me.

I had a strange dream last week.  I dreamed that I was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, which is basically arthritis of the spine and pelvis (and can have some affect on other joints), quit law school, and went on disability.  I'd been on it for a while.  Chris and I had bought a house, and in that house, I had an amazing workshop.  I had all of the equipment I've been lusting after - a kiln and cutting table for glasswork (the kiln, incidentally, was of the variety that has a wide enough heat range that it can be used for glass, metalclay, and ceramics, which made me very happy); a lathe, belt-sander, stationary jigsaw, miter saw, and router table for woodwork; my drafting table and paints in another corner; a station for soldering and who knows maybe even welding, so I could make jewelry and do stained glass; and I can't even remember what else was there, probably somewhere for a nicer spinningwheel than I have and my yarn collection.  It was a freaking amazing shop, and I knew that THAT was where all of my disability money had really gone (though nominally I paid rent and Chris bought most of the equipment).  And you know what?  In this dream, I was really, deeply happy.  Chris was making enough money that we could comfortably live on it, so what I made off of my artwork was a nice bonus but not a necessity.  No pressure to perform.  No stress.

I don't know if I would really be happy in that sort of scenario, but the dream...it was such a sense of relief to not have to drag my ass through doing stuff when I hurt too much, to not always be behind and buried and stressed.

Guess that tells you something about how I've been feeling lately, where every ounce of 'can' has been directed at school and none has been left for artistic pursuits."

Where we are is relatively low on flood potential.  A mile south of us is expected to flood a bit down by the Delaware (mostly due to poor drainage rather than due to the Delaware rising), and basically anywhere in Philly that has a creek or stream, and everywhere near the Schuylkill.  We're miles from the Schuylkill.

So we'll be okay here as long as we have power.  If we lose power, we may flee to somewhere that has power, what with my inability to tolerate heat and all.

I also realized (duh!) that I haven't been able to eat or drink large quantities of anything without throwing up, and even small quantities have me pretty nauseated.  Obviously I am not as well as I think I am.

I ended up with the NP I saw the last time I had a same-day appointment.  Also known as Mr. 'Your back hurts because you're fat' - nevermind that I've had back issues since I was in high school and could still wear children's sizes.  According to him, there's no reason to test me for Lyme's (even though I was negative for everything but c-reactive protein and had a bunch of Lyme-like symptoms, which have waxed and waned), I'm not dehydrated (even though the way I feel now - the dizziness and muscle cramping, when present with a GI flu, tends to be the way I feel when I'm within 24 hours of collapsing and ending up in the ER), they don't do IV fluids (even though my GP told me to go there for fluids the last time I ended up like this and ended up in the ER), and the ER wouldn't give me IV fluids (even though that's exactly what they give me when I come in like this - IV fluids and an IV anti-emetic, which god only knows why works better than the pills, at which point I go home and sleep off the last of this), and oh yeah, 'at my age', 100 isn't a fever - have to be running 100.5.

Chris is teaching for the Center For Talented Youth, out at Franklin Marshall College (Franklin and Marshall?  I can't remember).  Regardless, it's something like 2-3 hours from here, so he can't come home until he's done teaching for the week, which means ending at 3 tomorrow.

The last 3 years or so, every episode of the flu has turned into what most people would identify as a stomach flu and this is going that route.  If my doctor's office can't squeeze me in as a same day appointment and give me a bag of fluids (and I'll try my GI's, too, as they might be able to manage something), I will probably end up in the ER by the time Chris gets home tomorrow due to dehydration.

This was brought to you by the mice squeaking in the kitchen even though the fucking kitchen is clean and the food is secured, and also by the mouse I found in the bathroom earlier that apparently was eviscerated by something else (cats nextdoor?) and found its way to right next to the standing towel rack to dry.

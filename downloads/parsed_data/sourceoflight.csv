i've been talking to a lot of people. old and new. and the sentiments seem the same.

i've got some new bestest friends. and they rule the old school.

most recent music listening : decibully, black box recorder, xiu xiu (yep, another xiu xiu stage), nafules dream, the books, rhapsody as usual, saetia..

been writing again too. feels good. i haven't been completely happy in weeks but i'm getting there. my brother came to town and i actually spent some alone time with him for the first time since i was 9. we went to a drag show. that was fun. i'm glad he realizes now that me and the rest of the family are all comfortable with him being gay. he got to meet all my lesbian friends. ;) and he even saw an old buddy of him from highschool in drag at brothers.

i made some different decisions lately. and last nite i got a chance to talk them over with my whole family over coffee. laugh about it even. that felt really goood. lately i've been thinking about why i'm not travelling and i've come to the conclusion that it has a lot do with my mom. she worried a lot about me. and even though we could never live together, we both care about each other alot and can relate to each other. its nice getting close to her for once.

"event","i've been thinking about the two years of my life on the road. and i started remembering to tell people stories about it. then i realized there was 6 monthes in that time that really defined the experience. it was florida to new orleans to alabama to tennessee to arkansas to minneapolis to seattle to pocatello idaho to cheyenne wyoming to golden and then denver and then boulder colorado and then st louis and then columbus ohio and then back to minneapolis and then down to alabama again and then up to kentucky and then to asheville north carolina and then back to florida.

actually, all of that was about 4 and 1/2 monthes, two music fests, about 30 shows, maybe 100 new friends, about 100 rides, 20 trains, 50 stores shoplifted, 25 buildings squatted, 3 bad haircuts, 4 strangers kissed, 3 new tattoos, 2 alice packs, 3 multitools, 5 pairs of pants, 1,000 backrubs, hundreds and hundreds of miles, gallons and gallons of beer, hundreds of bagels, money made and then pissed away, thousands of dumpsters dived, cops, angels, mountains, semis, coffee, truckstops, fistfights, stars, patches, tapes, pictures, helicopters, a 93' mustang, piercing needles, waterfalls, dance parties, swimming, sewing, cooking, writing, dredding, rain, music, riots, tears, celebration....

what have i gained from the past 4 and 1/2 monthes. lots of work, not much money. drama. drama. drama. it seems like the only thing you get from having friends in this town. stress. little sleep. confusion. homesickness while lying in bed. my lungs hurt from smoking a lot more than i used to. everybody is hurting. everyone is looking for a reason to blow up. anything, oh god, anything to blow up at. just to feel something. i'm getting that way too. on edge. when i was out there i never wanted to fight anyone until the second the punch was thrown. now i want to punch people all the time. i'm losing it. i'm not going to be able to be nice mellow trainhopper girl anymore. soon it won't be about the big picture of things, and about how no one is really wrong, we're all just misunderstanding each other. soon it will be about the little picture. the look that sets it off. or the wording of a sentence. soon i'll be loud and inconsiderate, and irritable and i'll look for something to be pissed off at every moment just so i don't have to be pissed off at myself for not doing the things i want to. i can't sleep anymore, and because of that, i'm going to take everyone down. we'll all take each other down. unless we get out of here."

"event","lately i've been too busy.

too busy being in love, working too much, too hard, worrying about my weight or how many cigarettes i'm smoking, or how many vitamins i've taken. I've been busy making plans, dealing with drama, making new friends, revisiting old times with old ones, finding new things to do to keep my mind occupied. I've been too busy to think about who i am and who i'm becoming. 

So i take one moment to stop and think about WHY i'm moving in a direction instead of HOW and i come up so fucking empty. and then i remember what motivated me to go travelling in the first place. when i stopped ignoring the hollow goals and plans i'd been blindly following since i was born, looked them in the eye and saw them for what they were. when i stopped doing things just to do them, and actually only did what i wanted to. i remembered what made me happy and promised myself i'd only do those things all day every day for the rest of my life. i vowed i'd never forget again, that i would never get so caught up in being busy that i missed the big picture. and then i gave up comfortableness and numbness and certainty for risk, passion, adventure, recklessness, and complete uncertainty.

and let me tell you, i was the happiest i've ever been in my entire life. even the lowest lows you had hope and inspiration. you were completely fearless and knew that if you only just still had yourself, everything would work out allright. your sweat takes the place of your tears, in bad times, you walk and you walk, and you run, and you walk, and eventually you're in a better place.  if you do cry its very short and you get a hug and then you feel ten times better than you did to start with and you look at the stars and think about where you can go where its better. a housie kid will cry the kind of cry where you lay on your bed and curl up in a ball and cry for hours, and reach for hope and come up empty handed. one thing falls apart and its a domino effect. it takes a long time and a lot of new planmaking to get comfortable with yourself again. and when you wake up, you're not in much of a better place than you started.

so heres my plan, move to gainesville (which is a good start, its much better than here), work at cd warehouse (why? money), go to massage therapy school (why? money doing something i don't hate, yet, for a long time), why money? oh, to buy stuff and get a house and be happy. sure. i can do all that. its easy. and then when i get there i can make new plans. vacations possibly, collections possibly (music?), projects possibly, promotions maybe, self employment possibly, ""fun"" maybe. sounds good, and its an easy path there. but it still seems kind of shallow to me. just because even though it sounds comfortable, and good and easy and safe, i'm not excited by the thought of it all. i'm not shaking in my boots yet. i'm not jumping up and down in joy. nothing like that. i'm just ""okay"" with it. for now. but i can see my self middleaged and bored with life. and all my friends, the same.

but at least i can take solace in the thought that if i ever get sick to my stomach of it all,if all the pieces fall down, i'll still have the road, and myself.

and skip, i miss you. stop living so far away."

i'm starting to feel homesick for that place. 4 more monthes keeps sounding longer and longer. especially since brent is going to be there, and i'm going to be working way too much and sleeping way too little. we talked all last nite and cuddled. i remembered about the blackouts i used to have when i was younger and talked about it with him. drank blackberry pomagranate juice. smoked way too much.

things with brent are fantabulous. we went through a brief period a little while back where we argued about something stupid every couple of days, like a board game or something, but other than that we've gotten along perfectly. my mom loves him. she says ""but don't marry him until he's done with college, i want to be able to throw you guys a really good reception."" haha. we're going to new orleans next weekend. we're going to stay with my friends there and go to some shows and drink on the streets and eat at all the really coool old converted opium bars and such.

skip came through last weekend. he came with his travelmate brian. we all partied like it was 1999. i made this insane fucking dog skeleton stencil off of this picture brent drew for a possible skinny puppy tattoo for me. skip told me stories and he left our old zine here so i can make copies of it, finally. skip got seema all excited about hopping trains. we decided we might all take a beach party trainhopping crew to pensacola with some people who have never hopped before. because me and skip know out hometowns tallahassee and pensacola sooo fucking well it would be an easy trip.

"event","when i was 13, sometimes i would go to a punk show and drink and mosh all night. then me and my friends would go over to this guy named tiggur's house and drink more and sleep on the couches and the floor in his living room. in the morning i'd always wake up first and watch everyone else still asleep. i was extremely clearminded and peaceful during those mornings. i would never be hung over. 

one morning tiggur got up not too long after me and found me in the living room writing in this notebook i used to carry around with me all the time. he invited me into his room for some coffee. i'd never been in his room before. i didn't even like coffee back then. i decided to go anyways for some company until everyone else woke up. his room was a center of peace in a chaotic world. my first-found sanctuary. large pieces of carved wood rested upwards against his painted walls. strings dangled down holding flowers upside down to dry out. he had a low table on which he kept a collection of stones and knick knacks in a weird punk rock altar. he had a shelf of books on philosophy, herbs, hunting, music, anything you could ever want to learn about, he had it. he had a huge homeade reptile cage tower with several different pets basking in their seperate heatlamps. we sat around talking quietly and sipping on bitter black coffee. he talked about moving to ireland. i talked about moving to scotland. after a while he suggested we go forage through yard sale remains. piles of unsold clothes and appliances left by the street on a weekend afternoon and suburban neighborhoods. we drove around and waved to people staring out of windows of the houses we stopped at. he found a really really old typewriter. i found an old motheaten white lingerie dress which i ended up later wearing for weeks at a time because it felt so comfortable. it covered my body without actually feeling like i was wearing anything.

i never went in his room again. a few monthes later his house burned down from a candle his roomate accidentally left lit, and i ended up playing at a benefit show for him in the co-op.

but that strangely ethereal mood he set my path on never left me. at home on my chest i made my own sort of altar. with leaves. flowers. stones. burned out fuses. bolts and nails. anything i found and took a liking to i arranged it into my collection. when i was depressed or stressed out i would run my nails along roughed up pieces of metal flatted out by cars or tenderly slip my fingers between the dried out petals of flowers i'd picked and dried upside down by strings. 

when i turned 14 things started to get rough on the homefront. the first time i left, i packed all of my favorite things i'd collected into an old metal monster lunchbox and taken it with me. in the years that passed, whether i was at home, or on the run, or kicked out and cold in the street, or living in my car, or hitchiking around, the box was ever present and just being within close proximity i felt a kind of peacefulness, fearlessness, no worry that anything that came my way would be too big to handle.

when i was 16 i was living in a squat way outside of town with a guy named adam. he had a job down the street at a restraunt but he squatted and dumpstered and saved all his money except for on occasional packs of cigarettes or guitar strings. he wanted to save up money to go to school and study philosophy. my box had been well taken care of and added to, with letters from evan, newfound treasures that were just trash to anyone else, and a book evan had made for me out of cardboard, broken glass and red paint. also among those things were some zines i had been given or found along the way that inspired me to think positively out of my position. challenge the ways i'd been brought up to see things. realize there were other options that i had never been given before.

eventually our squat got busted and adam moved in with evan and some other people and for a while i stored my few things at their house while i couch hopped until i moved into the OAF house. when i got my things from adam's house, i forgot entirely about my box, trying to figure out where i was going with my life. whether my straight A agenda at school would really guide the agenda of my life. so yea, i could make good marks while sleeping in dirt in a house with no power or water, but did that mean that was the only way for me to go, or did my perserverance have some other plot for my life?

in the excitement and fear of the future i forgot all about my past and where it all started. isn't that how it always works out? then the other night i was meeting evan in a coffeehouse so he could tell me about chicago and hong kong and what he'd been doing lately. he walked in with a big grin on his face and in his hands he was holding my monster box. i hadn't seen in in years and at first i didn't recognize it until i opened it. inside were all the tiny treasures of my past to behold. i flippped through the zines and letters, i counted the burned out fuses and remembered exactly what i was thinking about and where i was walking to when i found each one on the side of the road. me and evan walked down the traintracks all the way to the other side of town and back. we talked and walked like that alongside each other in long coats and stringy hair (matching shadows) we did that for close to four hours before he said his goodbyes.

the moral of the story is this, its so easy to get caught up with whats going on at this moment. i think about the cigarette my body clock is telling me its time to smoke. the coffee i need to go get to feel awake. the 8 hours of work i need to get up for soon and go do. and then after i get done with that i'm going to be hungry and its time to make some food. if i even try to think about next week or next month it's image appears in my head as a calendar with little events, shows, appointments, lunches, work shifts, my boyfriend's classes. the future is a blur of possibilities way in the future compared to what stands in front of me assuming a more militant posture. but even more blurry than that is the past. where it all started. what led to what? what book or person or altar or leaf led to the way i'm feeling or reacting right now? take a step back every once in a while. try to remember. what used to be important to you. what you were scared of as a kid but now feel like you've overcome might be a bad thing. those fears might be filtering into something else. those little promises you made yourself and used to adhere to religiously, but now has lost its meaning in ""sacrificing in order to grow"". maybe we're all growing up too fast. maybe we were nicer, more clearminded, less judgemental, more open, when we didn't have so many other factors weighing in. 

one time my dog was fighting with another dog in railroad square. i started chatting with the other owner after we'd broken them up. ""its just a territorial thing"" he said. ""yea, my dog is usually pretty nice"" i responded. then he said ""i bet if they had met in an open field somewhere running around, they would have been best friends.""

and thats how i feel about all this.

goodnite."

last night. brent came home. and i rubbed him down for about 45 minutes. then we were cuddling and i don't know what happened but he touched me in some sort of wrong way or something and it made me feel a little tinge of negative feeling, like the kind that has ruined relationships of mine before. but he picked up on it immediately. we went and smoked a cigarette. and he asked me what was wrong exactly and i tried to explain it a little bit. then we just looked at each other for a really long time. and i felt really happy. because that negative feeling usually starts and just doesn't stop and i can't explain what it feels like, and someone can't understand what it is that triggered it. but he understood. and i could pinpoint it exactly. and he was okay with it. and then three minutes later we were back to rolling around together and cuddling and it felt good.

this morning we woke up around 2 and rolled around in bed for a little while together and then made brunch. then the travelling kids called and we went and got coffee. they were hanging out with this travelling girl named sarah that used to live here and was visiting town too. we all decided to go out to cherokee sinks and jump off the ledge and go play in freezing cold water. then we went and saw a movie and got food. then brent had to go to work and me and the travelling kids played scrabble and went over to this guy ben's house. then we went to the warehouse and met up with aydin and enrique. all in all, it was a very good feeling day off. the next few days i'm going to be so busy i can't even handle it. i'm just gonna work sleep and eat all robot stylin. with cuddle breaks with brent in between.

"event","brent told me he loves me. 

duh. 

and in case you haven't already guessed. i'm in love with him. not just like. not just love. but ""in love"".

we've been jammin' out to murder ballads. a LOT.

so tonite. brent got pulled over and got a !$120!! ticket for having his BRIGHTS ON. bah. then we got food and saw two travelling kids walking down the street. we picked them up and got them coffee and played dice. i drew them a map to the area and told them to give me a call later so we can chizill.

today. worked both jobs. tommorrow i have off. then every day for the next four and possibly more days, i work at both jobs. 

so this morning sitting on the porch, out of nowhere, i suddenly felt like an adult. it was like that specific moment on this january 2nd, 2005 1:15 pm, was the moment i changed from a girlthing to an adultthing. its not like i feel any less silly, or spontaneous, it was just the kind of feeling that made me sit up straighter and made me want to complain less. need less cigarette breaks. all the things i've learned in life have come together now in such a way that i feel like i've got an education, not just crammed for a few exams and then faded those lessons into the darker regions of my brain. 

with brent i don't feel like a little girlthing giggling and groping. i feel like i'm nurturing, calming, passionate, and understanding. i can't say that i love him more than i've ever loved anyone, because my obsession with evan borders on psychotic. but i can say i love him different than anyone. something about this feels more permanent. we're not just dreaming about a future as ""our future"" we're actually writing each other into our life scripts. i haven't even really been talking to anyone else because all i do when i'm not working is sit around with him, cook food, talk, smoke cigarettes, share coffeedrinks, wander around, take pictures, build treehouses, write letters.

this is a new kind of adventure. and i like it a lot."

"event","its 2005. time to start things off right.

i made a new box to keep my dreams in.
and a new notebook to write my words in.
beads to cover my scars with.

i'm gonna forget. 
and i'm not gonna look in the mirror and hate myself and take it out on anyone. because i'm simply not going to hate myself. why should i. i am happy and ""in love"". i've found someone that makes me feel complete and balanced. not obsessed or sick.

and he writes me letters. and draws for me. and tells me that he's composed a space for me in his house he's gonna build. and for an architect, that says a lot. and he says that drawing big empty rooms and long halls is a metaphor. empty rooms. empty echoing rooms.

""well shit"", i said. ""i'll just have to be an interior decorator and fill your shit up... like you fill me up.""

new years started off right as it should. fucking up uncorking a bottle of wine with brent behind his work. kissing about maybe... eh... ten minutes after we hear people counting down to one at the houses having parties around us. ""as usual brent, you're perfectly on time..."" kiss. and he is.

a week. and it felt familiar. two weeks and i was feeling passionate. i waited for the third week where everything falls to shit. and it got better instead. week four. hooks dig deeper. feels better that way. week 5, and we're drawing out our maps to the future. and it feels right. i feel fixed. i feel like i've been touched where no one else could. and in a second he could break me worse than i've ever been broken. (but i don't tell him that.) and i'm not scared. 

last year on new years. i was in jail on a bunk warrant that someone ""forgot"" to delete. my boyfriend was cheating on me. and i knew it. 

two years ago. on new years. i was in the emergency room with duct tape joe who was ridiculously sick. we got home around 2 and drank a beer and all fell alseep on the living room floor.

the two years before that, i just went to sleep. didn't feel like dealing with it.

in 2000, i first kissed the boy that night that i would later lose my virginity to. ross took off his pants and ran around my backyard with sparklers screaming ""TOGA TOGA!!"" me and jonmarc hid under a table and talked about boys and skinny puppy for an hour.

its weird to think how much i've changed in 5 years. and i can't say that the past few years its been for the better. but now i'm starting to think its all for the better in the end.

everyone else... new years resolutions time!"

"event","i'm having another nightmare. another dream that will come true. and he wakes me up. holds me close. i try to struggle and he holds me tighter. finally i feel safe even from myself. he knows when to let go and when not to let go. when to push and when to let go. he knows when i need him the most.

and i explained it like this. i'm a little too fucked up in the head to make it through life without just breaking everything around me or going completely insane. he's a little too sane to see far enough of the spectrum to enjoy what he's got completely. i am unfocused. he is too focused.

we can show each other everything that we've missed. 

and i've been begging to just please just be able to fall in love with someone and feel sexy and feel cuddly and feel wanted and be able to keep it that way. and have it get better and better. to get more comfortable instead of less. please please please. please don't make it be forced. i want to be able to have sex. and be sober. and not cry afterwards. not hate him afterwards. not feel sick. not feel like my being turned on is one step above being controlled.

and everything else goes so wrong. goes to shit. and it gets worse and worse. the harder i try to be in love, the more i hate it. 

i don't know what's different this time. maybe a better balance. something about him makes him know when no means yes and when no means no. and when yes means no and yes means yes. he knows when to wake me up from a nightmare and bring me back to him. and when to let me sleep it through. he can read me. and it scares me. and i like it a lot. and i like to think i can read him just as well. fix him just as much.

i wish you could see how happy i am right now.


written two years ago in memory of 5 years ago:

""this story begins and ends in sickness. and i've spent whole days consumed in darkness. i'd lock myself in closets and breathe air so thick i couldn't see through it. and i've spent nites in the rain. it seems so simple to find someplace dry to sleep. and its impossible now to forget the stinging cold and the reluctant candle.

and i sat in the middle of a dried up lake and we kept each other dry. and i've spent weeks on a loop in the same situation, different day. and i'd wake up still drunk and spend the morning puking up stomach acid and antidepressants. and i'd snort valium just to fall asleep in class and keep myself from thinking. and who wouldn't choose to float over sinking.

its all slow motion. his rough hands on my already cut wrists. a knee in my stomach and i can't remember how to breathe anymore, on my side coughing with my face in the dirt. and by this time i remember how to breathe and i'm screaming but its all pointless... all pointless. and later he's gone leaving a number on a receipt and a sick smile to haunt my dreams asleep next to you. and i cover up the bruises on my wrists and thighs and call my friends. within an hour i'm higher than the sky.

and now he wonders what makes me cold and what makes me cringe. its memory i can't shake.. the few sick moments i remember in the swirls of darkness and drunkness. don't even try to understand, just shove some more dirt in my cuts. ""does THAT make you uncomfortable?"" he says in sarcasm. yeah it does.. yeah it does.

and you know what. i'm glad this this chain is broken, and all the stars are falling now, and the oceans are overflowing. and i'm glad this flood brings on shivers. and all the light is in fragments. the windows all break in jagged pieces. and even a falled tree can form a sitting place. we can make use of any tragedy. and we are inspired by fate. kissing you goodbye i felt inspired to fly... and jumping off a cliff seemed the best way at the time. but i'm smarter now, and older. and in only a few monthes i've learned not to trust trust. and i've learned the difference between elegant beautiful, and chaotic beautiful. and you are a shapeshifter, you shift in my dreams between passionate demon and destructive lover.

and you leave me clinging to cold sheets, and dreaming in black and white. anything to provoke this moment. you just can't stop dancing. i'm going to draw a map to the universe and i'll put a star where you sleep.

i thought you'd make me balance, but instead you just broke the scale.

.you make me. (.sick.) ""



run through

what wakes you up
when its worth the time
who has the right
theres one power
i've had enough
find you so sour
soon i'll give up
fool its a total low
how can i explain another daylight
nothing's right in these arms
this cannot explain another daylight
so i'll go at it alone
take all the rough
sounds like more of the same
i've had enough
movement is hard in this game
how can i explain other daylight
nothing's right in these arms
this cannot explain another daylight
so i'll go at it alone
time is up
why with all of this."

it's weird. having a hometown. and being in it.
i'm on the phone with another old friend.
she's in washington.

i can't wait to get the fuck out of here.


brent.

he's dominating. selfish. egotistical. self assured. goal oriented.
he's exactly what i need right now.
he knows how to get what he wants. he knows how to give me what i want. he knows how to not take things so seriously. he knows how to take the things seriously that need be taken seriously. he knows how to deal with me when i'm in a bad mood. to make things better. to not let them sit around gaining momentum.

lets see what happens.


work.

vinyl fever is busy, full of people shopping for christmas. guthries is dead. and thats how i feel when i'm there. and i put in my two weeks notice there. i'm done with that shit for good now. time to move on. get a better second night job. or just work one job and not kill myself. i'm making plenty of money with just vinyl fever.


music.

chinupchinup.
back into the teardrop explodes.
lots of bauhaus.
the unicorns.
rhapsody.
gold chains.
nina nastasia.


mood. 

calm before the storm.
i'll make peace no matter how much you deny me.
i can't wait until next weekend.
havent' seen my fam in a year now."

"event","things are going good. they are going soo good. i have good openminded responsible roomates that i'm ridiculously comfortable with. a boy that i'm comfortable with. a good job. good hours. good friends. starting to get back in the tally scene. found some people to play music with. and most importantly, i got a coffee maker that works.

now the question is what i want to do next. i pretty much have three good choices. i can stay here and save up money and do the projekt projekt tour next summer and see where that takes me. i could move to gainesville next year with brent and go to massage therapy school, or i could go down to south florida and learn all sorts of healing arts.

i need you guys, especially skip town marlin, to help me decide. here are the pros and cons:

me and skip have been trying to get this tour off the ground for over a year. i miss the road a lot. one of the reasons i settled down again was to get a van so we could do the tour. well i got a van, but now because of hunter, it's broken down. and because of hunter AND/OR billis, its busted up. which means i get to start from scratch again on that plan. having to start from scratch is a pretty hopeless feeling in that direction.

if i go to gainesville, not only do i get to go to the massage therapy school i've wanted to go to for years, but i still can be with brent, i can find a cool job there that i like, and i have a bunch of friends there that i miss. the scene is great. i stayed there a lot so i know the area. i'd be able to find people to play music with and party down with. downside is, i'm still not travelling. and eventually that might get to me.

if i go to south florida, my uncle, a nationwide renowned natural healer will teach me everything he knows, for free. from accupuncture, accupressure, massage therapy, herbal healing, and chiropractor madness. he's been to several different countries studying this stuff. its pretty much the chance of a lifetime. he literally makes between 100 and 300 AN HOUR for his services. i would also have a free place to stay, so i wouldn't have to work. the downsides are that i don't have any friends down there anymore, and that my uncle is also a little bit of a wingnut (this guy refuses to eat solid food he just juices stuff and drinks it all day long). the upside is that i could definately deal with a job that i only have to work like 10 hours a week at and still be making a fat income. my uncle mostly only works on a trade basis for his service, like in exchange for a pet, or art, or surfing lessons, and he still makes enough money to live the high life.

i just don't know which one is me. they all fit different sides of myself. i just gotta pick which direction to move in i suppose. time for the next adventure here in a few monthes.

skip, i miss you. come see me."

i rang him up. ""you should give me your shirt"". i said. we joke around for a few minutes. he's not from around here. just moved here. for a job. he likes our radio station. 

i think he'll like lovage. so i give him the cd i burned. tell him he'll probably like it. he leaves and i know i'll never see him again. don't really care too terribly much. but then ten minutes later he comes back in with a cd he burned. he wrote his name and number on it. ""call me, let me know what you think of it.""

"event","i don't get it. the way you measure your successes in pieces of paper. diplomas. awards. dollar bills (bling bling bitch).

life is about learning, loving, and experiencing as much of the world as possible. in whatever way you might choose to do it. how can you fucking say one way is the ""right"" way. how can you put yourself above everyone else in this world that is learning and loving and living the life they want to lead?

i've seen the world. i've read and heard viewpoints from every direction. i've fallen in love. had my heart broken many times. broken hearts too i'm sure. i've scraped up my knees. put my hands in the dirt and tried to make something grow from it. i've written pages and pages of stories. i've learned in classes. i've learned in the middle of nowhere with no one but myself and my dog to keep me moving. i've starved. i've almost frozen to death. i've squatted caves in minnesota. i've smoked opium with drug lords in washington. i've fought cops in protests. i've screamed at the top of my lungs until my throat was raw. 

i'm only 18. i've experienced more than most people will in their entire lives. i've been more people than most people will their entire lives. i'm happy with what i've done and the hopes i have for the future. fuck you if you think that i'm less than you for not doing things your way. right now, i work my ass of 6 to 12 hours a day to make less than 800 dollars a month so i can work towards the next adventures i want to have in my life. i miss my real friends. the ones who would cry with me and risk death with me, every second all of us putting each others happiness before our own. i miss that dream. here in reality, its all about the fight to the top. its all about making other people feel like shit so that you can feel better about yourself. its all about clinging to what is yours because sharing means that you're on an equal level with someone else. and not being above someone else is death in this life. 

skip. remember attapulgus georgia and frozen fingers and jumpsuits. and ftaa. and sleeping on top of that roof in ft lauderdale. and orange soda at 7 am. and the warehouse kegger. i love you. miss you. if you see my funky mutt or nate, send them down where its warm."

<P>you died in a car accident. i was supposed to die in a car accident, not you. </P>
<P>you were at the first show i ever went to. open mind. we got on the stage and danced together. at the old cow haus. the singer said ""give a hand to our new open mind dance team!""</P>
<P>you let open mind sign your tits. i only let them sign my belly.</P>
<P>i saw you at every punk show i ever went to in those days. we were 13. we were a fucking crew.&nbsp; a crew of 13 year old punks with self torn up clothes and cheezy band patches. we both liked the buzzcocks.</P>
<P>you were one of the few people i knew when i went to sail, and one of the few people i still had respect for when i left.</P>
<P>we hung out in the graveyard downtown. its ironic now.</P>
<P>we got drunk at tiggur's old house. sat on the roof, talked all nite. we played a benefit show in the co-op together when tiggur's house burned down. </P>
<P>i told my travelling friends that you were one of the few people in tallahassee they'd actually like. you weren't shallow or conceited and most importantly, you weren't scared of fuckin' rockin'.</P>
<P>you'd hang out at me and my boyfriend's house and drink beer and talk with him about working class skinhead bands. </P>
<P>you lied to me only once. and it hurt pretty bad but i got over it. and i got my drums back eventually that were stolen. it's not your fault.</P>
<P>you played a show in my garage for my 16th birthday party. at the end of the tape of the show, i said ""dance for us derek"", and you did. cause you fucking rock and i love you.</P>
<P>you weren't supposed to fucking die and you know it.</P>

my feet are stuck and my eyes leak
but I feel the ceiling drop
the floor rising
it won't stop
time away is all I need
a curse walks around here
I see it hide behind my chair
and it peers at me
it's grip is so strong
it bruises me
everynight the light blows out
silence hears me coming
everyday it fakes us out
silence hears me coming"

"event","i don't know exactly what it was that brought it on. a little spiral i had weaved into my hair came out in my hands, and then i decided it was time for the dreds to go. i sat in front of the mirror for about ten minutes with a pair of scissors holding a single snipped dred in my hand almost about to cry. 

then i spent 5-6 hours after that slowly picking out my dreddy tangles one by one. 

traditionally, one would cut off their dreds after they go through a major lifechange and feel like they're starting over. i think i'm feeling like that right now. i feel like i've become pretty much the person i wanted to become, openminded, forgiving, unconditional love type of person. and i feel like i have a pretty good idea of what i want out of the future. thats a pretty big change from the scared insecure little girl i was 5 years ago.

in other news, things are great here in p-cola. getting a lot of writing/music/stencilling/creating stuff done. i feel very productive.

but i miss ricky b a hella lot. ricky b, get a fucking teleporter.

bah. love. gra."

skip, you'd better be prepared to take projekt projekt to the next level of insanity.

today. all of my writers block went away. i think i'm going to spend most of the day writing about some of my travelling experience. i thought about it today and i can't think of a single good book written by a female tramp. if anyone can think of one, please let me know.

luv.

p.s. also, if you're basically dating someone, tell each other you love them all the time, cuddle, spend time together always, but don't kiss and don't call it officially dating... what DO you call it?"

my life is all ups and downs and right now.. and its all downhill from here, baby.

i've been raped, i've hopped trains, i've been addicted to drugs, i've scammed trips to europe and free food, i've seen people die, i've seen babies being born, i've seen people waste their lives away only to regret it in later years, i've seen people take control of their lives and seize every moment of them, i've seen junkies covered in their own piss and puke in ditches passed out, i've seen new orleans after the rain, i've ran away from situations, i've come back with new insight, i've lost friends to time, i've gained friends for life....

but right now, right now is one of the most confusing times in my life. the time to choose between two extremes and there really is no in between. the time when every little betrayal or rainstorm adds a tally to one of the teams, and every sunset is a sunset i drink to indecision again.

the tracklist is good though. always good."

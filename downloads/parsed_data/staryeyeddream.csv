"event","Not a lot's goin on and that's the problem. I miss seeing my friends...in fact IDK y I haven't seen em. PPL have started avoiding me. I hate it when ppl r mad or don't want 2 be around me. I have a phobia of not being loved by those that I love. I know that sounds odd & wimpy but oh well..get over it. I may have 2 true friends @ the moment.

The world pisses me off. Some ppl have realized how bad the world pisses me off. PPL have started pointing out the fact that I can't do anything right. I already knew that so y do u need 2 point it out?! & would u ppl stop tryni 2 change me.

Just when I think things start 2 get better they get worse. It may not seem like a lot 2 u but u don't know the half of it."

Everybody's against me & my mom just decided that Matt can't call ne more (on their line @ least...) & I can't meet him @ the mall ne more..that's just rediculous. I'm doing my best not 2 talk 2 her b/c if I do I'll prolly cuss her out. Well there r some rays of hope...we do go back 2 school in 2 days so maybe things'll straighten out.."

"event","Happy 2004 to me...well not really. I'm so confused with all the crap that's goin on. Its seems like everybody's pissed off @ me. IDK wut I did.. Maybe it'll all get straightened out...I hope so. I actually can't wait 2 go back 2 school believe or not. I think I failed science if so then I'ma be SOOO grounded. This ""break"" is turning out 2 be so stressful.

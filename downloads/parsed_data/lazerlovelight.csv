 today's topic: my boss's todo list.
 classification: ridiculous
 
 it's not uncommon for my boss to storm into my office insisting that a new task she just invented out of thin air is suddenly ""top priority"" and must be done ASAP.&nbsp; as a result, the paper in front of me that had previously listed my priorities from 1-10 often gets entries in the negative numbers as she makes her additions.&nbsp; my coworkers and i have long wondered how it is possible for so many tasks to be of the utmost urgency simultaneously.&nbsp; well, a few weeks ago we got a little insight.&nbsp; she had left hastily for a meeting and we came upon her todo list for the day.&nbsp; there were over 40 items.&nbsp; each item was assigned a letter grade for its priority.&nbsp; EVERY item on the list was either A or A+ priority.&nbsp; what kind of insane troll logic is this?&nbsp; how am i supposed to take her seriously when she gives me an ""urgent"" assignment?&nbsp; well of course after we read that, phrases like ""ASAP"" and ""top priority"" lost all meaning.&nbsp; it's just white noise.&nbsp; it's too bad really, i had been working on a nice ulcer that's now going untended.&nbsp;"

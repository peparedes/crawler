"event","everyday is better than the one that came before it.
in case you can't tell, i've found the one person who makes me truly happy.
someone with whom i can be myself and be appreciated more than when i am simply trying to change myself to please her.  
i found the person with whom i want to spend the rest of my life.  
when you are as happy as i am just to be in another person's presence... you know that something is goin right.  and that is a great feeling.  i know that something is going right... VERY right.  And to me, that something is everything, so i could say that in my life, everything is going right at this moment. 
and i couldn't be happier"

You are a SECL--Sober Emotional Constructive Leader. This makes you a Politician.

You cut deals, you change minds, you make things happen. You would prefer to be liked than respected, but generally people react to you with both. You are very sensitive to criticism, since your entire business is making people happy.

At times your commitment to the happiness of other people can cut into the happiness of you and your loved ones. This is very demanding on those close to you, who may feel neglected. Slowly, you will learn to set your own agenda--including time to yourself. 

You are gregarious, friendly, charming and charismatic. You like animals, sports, and beautiful cars. You wear understated gold jewelry and have secret bad habits, like chewing your fingers and fidgeting.

You are very difficult to dislike.

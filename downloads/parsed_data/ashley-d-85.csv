"event","contemplating how flipping lucky I am to work at a chocolate store AND a cupcake store. life doesn't get more delicious...well, unless i was doing some dirty, grungy, rock star-y boy toy. that would be more delicious. school starts soon. i'm going to class this year. really. i am. i'm also going to do work/read stuff this year. it's a true story. hmm...english and history. and all i want to do is learn how to play guitar. i'm dying to be a rock star. i think girls in bands are really cool. saw my friend justin play the other night and a teenage band went on afterwards and the bass player was a girl about 16 years old. i remember thinking, ""i wish i was that cool when i was 16."" welcome week starts soon. super duper excited about that. ""We are the S-O-Cs..."" cant wait to get weird looks because im screaming and jumping in a bright orange suit that features an eclectic mix of jagger, care bears, cheech and chong and sammy, my pizza man. i love sammy. and miss him dearly. soon i will see him again. i plan on being drunk a lot in sept. after i do my school work that is;) i'm out."

"event","I went to see Ben Lee last night with my friend Carla and my friend Dave also happened to be there. Words cannot describe how seeing him live makes me feel. For those of you who don't know who he is, www.ben-lee.com and www.myspace.com/benlee should give you an idea. This is a person who still gets a real kick out of performing live. Still enjoys his audience. Is enjoying more and more commercial success (he has a real tour bus now!) and yet is still the nicest guy both before and after the show. His audience is pretty die-hard, myself included. One of the best moments is always his closing song, ""We're All in this Together"" where everyone shuts up, sings along and claps and you feel a real sense of a community of music lovers and real sense of genuity...something that isn't around so much at more commercial venues/shows. Got an autograph and a pic afterwards, like usual. And on a silly note, there was no ""eye intercourse"" this time around, but then again, I wasn't directly in front of him. I will always remain fond of that special time we shared at El Mocambo in the t-dot. Peace out, me."

"event","So I had yet another excursion in Hess last night. Loads of fun. Until I lost my cell phone. Why, you ask? well, because I'm a drunk idiot apparently. Oh, and apparently the last time I went to Hess I gave my number to an ""ugly"" (Alicia's words, not mine, ppl, I'm not that harsh) boy who called me yesterday. Oy vey. So, who's up for more Hess tonight? MEEE!!! *sighs* I just can't leave that beautiful little village alone. It's so intoxicating. Literally. 
Oh, and I got a new cell. It cost me $50 because I was due for an upgrade anyways. So it's the same number."

"event","Had an awesome night last night in a little village that's known as Hess. Loads of fun. Went with my housemates/friends, who are a good group of people to hang with. I have a lot of affection for my friends. There's people that have only had to put up with me in recent years like Alicia for example and then there's people who have put up with me for decades like Carla or Miranda. Anyhoo...if any of you read this know that I love you for putting up with my shananamagins. (and of course i love you in general) Ok, back to Hess. We started off at Side Bar where I probably had about 5 or so delicious shots, then we went dancing at Funky Munky, which was pretty damn packed for a little old Tues night. I loooove Hess in the summer time. I'd live there, but I wouldn't get any sleep and I'd be pretty bitchy. Ok, I'm done typing with a hangover, I'm sure none of this really makes any sense. :P"

"event","Hey, so this is my first entry. I've decided my blog will be Seinfeld-esque. Funny, but about nothing. Big shoes to fill, eh? Well, I have to work tomorrow, so I need to get to bed. Perhaps I'll write something more interesting and funny in the morning. Night kids."

"event","I dunno what's going on.  I can't figure out if it is something that I did or if it is just my roomie in a non-social mood.  Here's what happened...

She went to Cincinnati this past weekend right.  Well, when she left she didn't say anything to me, so I had no idea that she had left for the weekend.... hmmmm ok.... Then, when she comes back Sunday I am reading and studying for my test I have Thursday and she comes into the room.  She kinda mumbled, ""I need to check something real quick."" and turns on the television.  I thought it would be quick so I decided not to say anything and try to continue reading.  Well, 10 minutes later, the tv was still on so I left and went to the lounge to finish reading.  A few minutes later she leaves, without telling me, and comes back with her boyfriend to watch the race.  Then, once the race was over, she and her boyfriend leave again without telling me.  I go back into my room to read and not even 20 minutes later she comes back.  Not a problem except now she has a convo with a girl from down the hall who she invites to come in.  I AM STILL READING!  I don't know if she just couldn't tell that I was reading or if she didn't care.  I don't know what to do. 

Since then, we haven't really talked and I wouldn't know what to say to her if we had.  I am kinda upset that happened but there was nothing I could have done.  Like I said, if I had known she was going to be watching something for a while I would have asked her to go to the lounge (where we have a perfectly working tv) or to someone else's room cause I was working on stuff for a test.  

Who knows....  any ideas?

mom and dad loved their scrapbook, or i think they did, lol.  they seemed to like it and that was good.  it took me forever to do it.  hopefully my next one doesnt take nearly as long.  we will see when i get supplies to start it.  

i am beginning to feel sick too.  it didn't start til this morning and i don't know if it is from carissa and bailey who were sick last week or if it was sleeping in what my aunt refers to as the ""meat locker""  lol.  their house is freezing at night because of their old windows... i slept in 2 pairs of pants!  eek!  crazy!  so, hopefully when i catch up on the sleep i didnt get i will be all better.  

well... i think im gonna go lay in bed now and try to sleep a lil bit...  leave me warm and loving messages ;)

"event","Ok so Friday into Saturday we got this crazy snowstorm.  It was supposed to hit 150 miles south of here... (Cincinnati) but instead... the wind blew and it hit Bowling Green!  We were totally dumped on with 10-12 inches of snow!  That is a ton of snow especially when the winds are 20mph and the temperature is only 15!  So, the school did a terrible job of cleaning the sidewalks and didn't really touch the streets.  All of the snow that blew onto the sidewalks after they cleaned them got all compacted and now in many places it is ice.  I think I have decided to let myself fall down on the ice and break a bone and then sue the school for my tuition.  I need some ideas... what would you do?  LOL.  Let me know.  Love you all....

"event","Goodness... I haven't had any time to write.  The first week of class is done and I have come to the conclusion that this semester is going to suck big time.  I am lucky though... only 4 classes and 15 credits.  The sucky thing is that all of my classes require tons of reading!  Even calculus!!  That's insane.  I think that as long as I keep up with all of the reading then I should do ok.  Who knows... prayers will be needed. lol.  
It's been a boring day.  All I have done is sit around here doing a puzzle and watching movies on tv.  Oh yea... I got to spend quality time with Brandon all day too.  Even if it was just sitting around and doing absolutly nothing... it is still quality time.  hehe.
Well, I am off to maybe play some roller coaster tycoon. :)  Leave some love.  ;)"

Being sick isn't all that bad except for the fact that my illness seems to be the same thing as I had in September!  This is so not cool!  I am just afraid that because this is the second time in one semester that I got this illness I may have to go to the doc. yet again!  That's not the worst thing... I have heard from some people that if my doctor is anything like theirs she might want to take my tonsils!  EEK!  I'm afraid!  Well... I am going to go lay down again... like I have been all day.

I just needed money so I had to break down and get some hours at Robben's to bring in a couple bucks... all you college folks should know what i'm talking about lol.  
Coming back to school sucked though.  After all the great yummy food I got to eat at home I now am back to the shitty cafeteria food... yuck!  A plus side... 2 weeks of class and then finals week and I am home for about 3 weeks.  That's gonna be awesome.  Hopefully I get to see more people, but again, I am going to be working a lot to pull in some extra cash.  We will see later how that goes...
Well, I have 3 tests to study for (one tuesday, one wednesday and one thursday) so I gotta run...  Leave some loving messages :)

This midterm is one of two and then a final exam.  He takes your highest of the two midterm grades and doubles it and then adds in the final.  The problem... I got a 106% on the first so I don't have to take this one but all of its contents are possible items for the final also.  Now... I have no motivation to study at all.  I hope that I am able to know the stuff for the final well enough.  LOL I am just a huge freak.

"event","I was talking to my lil sis online this afternoon and she sent me a great blonde joke.  It kinda sounds like something that would happen to me in one of my biggest blonde moments lol.  Anyway... here it is:

Three women are about to be executed. One's a brunette, one's a redhead and one's a blonde. The gaurd brings the brunette forward and the executioner asks if she has any last requests. She says no and the executioner shouts ""Ready! Aim!"" Suddenly the brunette yells, ""EARTHQUAKE!!""Everyone is startled and throws themselves on the ground while she escapes. The gaurd bring the redhead forward and the executioner asks if she has any last request. She says no and the executioner shouts ""Ready! Aim!"" Suddenly the redhead yells ""TORNADO!!"" Everyone is startled and looks around for cover while she escapes. By now the blonde has it all figured out. The gaurd brings her forward and the executioner asks if she has any last requests. She says no and the executioner shouts ""Ready! Aim"" and the blonde yells ""FIRE!!""

Now, let me know what you think and if you want add more.  My roomie and I are always collecting good jokes and quotes to put up around the room and on our door.  Leave some for us!

Now... another thing I saw today...  it is truly a great idea.  I am going to steal it from Jen (a BG friend) and put it in here... hopefully you have some nice things to say :)

""IM me a message with a memory of me. It can be anything you want. Maybe our first meeting or maybe just your favorite experience. Post this on your info or in an away message and see what people remember about you.""

I think that is a great thing.  Like I said before, leave some nice comments to me lol.  I love you all!"

First of all, I got out of every class a lil early today and yesterday my classes seemed to drag on forever... especially my bio lab.  It took the whole 3 hours and most of the time our lab group was just sitting there waiting for other groups to finish so we could take down all of the data!!  GRRRR!!!!  Another reason today was better was the weather!  It seemed like fall again for the first time in a while.  I think the temperature went up into the mid to upper 50's!!  It was amazing!!!  Also, NO CLASS TOMORROW!!!  That makes today awesome.  I get to sleep in tomorrow!  Tomorrow I am also going to go do my civil duty and donate some blood :)  I enjoy saving people's lives.  It makes me feel good... well... a little light-headed but good lol.  I gotta run... maybe I will write again later... love you all!!

I get ready and am all prepared to follow her out there when my car decides it hates me and doesn't start so I have to go with my mom.  Then, I find out that my neighbor has a warrant out for her arrest!!!  What the hell??!! That is insane!  I went to the Oakie v. Elder football game with Brandon, his lil sis and his dad (the game sucked).  Then... saturday I wake up around 6:30 to begin my crazy day of the wedding stuff.  The wedding went well and I totally felt like a princess lol.  After the wedding and reception I went to a small party for maybe an hour then had to go home for bed cause I had another long day for sunday.  The whole weekend I was supposed to study for my philosophy test that is tomorrow and I didn't even have time to look at it once!  It was crazy!

"event","gah i love this song. it brings back all those memories of dancing around mr. scales' room in 8th grade. I was pretty foolish in middle school and i wish i could like go back and be cooler. i think everyone does though. its like the law to be wicked immature in middle school i think.

prince christopher (is that his name??) is possibly my favorite asian//caucasion//african american prince eva.

a snow day was pretty much the last thing i expected when i woke up today. i mean i didnt even know it was supposed to snow. im kinda mad though because i really just wanted to get midterms over with. at least this way i have more time to study.(hahahahaha)
but really im happy because its gonna be the best 1 1/2 day week see eff has ever seen. and friday is going to be r-a-d. :)

hmhmhm i think im going to name my son christopher. and not let anyone call him chris ahaha. ill be that evil mom that kids hate because their not allowed to call their friend a nickname. but not really, i wouldnt do that because im gonna be a cool mom not an evil one. so ill just call him christopher and if his friends really really want they can call him chris. hopefully he'll be big enough to be a christopher. so my bff won't be disappointed.

so it goes:

Jackk
Christopher
Hally
Lauren 
Ben

in order, of course.

yep yep

i hate snow go awayy :(

this means i have to ski.

fdsjgkdfj

snow snow go away come again another day

i miss natalee :( :(
sososoo much.

what am i gonna doo with myself every day six for the rest of my highschool careeeer

this is the first long update i have done in forever so im just gonna keep going.

so pretty much this weekend we established that the two hottest boys in the whole wide world are the guy from the unwritten video and uhhmm todd from fox and the hound :[ 

i keep thinking we have school tomorrow. yess american idols on. i want to see that one girl in the pink shirt. so far i like those twins they were reaallly good and reallly hott. and that one girl that sang chain of fools and that kid that was like obsessed with frank sinatra? which is weird, but hey he's good and cute. and the guy paula's in love with. andd that 16 year old girl who was amazzzzinng. and umm i think thats it. oh and at first i was like wtf why did they let that cowboy dude on he sucks and hes weird and creepy but then i watched it again and i was like awwww i feel really bad for him and hes good so he deserves a shot. i think he has mucho potential. and i think hes like mentally handicapped so i just feel bad for him and so now i like him. oh and i also like that guy with the wife and kids hes good but its weird how like everysingle time they showed him other then the audition he was in some corner making out with his wife who's like 10 years older than him :/

i feel like amanda now because im going on and on about stuff people probably don't really care about. sorry amanda :X

ok sooo i think im done.

Your purpose in life is to life freely and collect experiences.

You love life - new adventures, new people, new ideas.
You are very curious, and you crave novelty in all forms.
You tend to make friends easily, and you enjoy the company of all types of people.

In love, you are fun and even a bit intoxicating. But you won't stick around for long.

You are impulsive and spontaneous - which sometimes leads you to do things you regret.
Sometimes you can be overindulgent with food, sex, or drugs.
You have many talents, so many that you are often scattered and unfocused.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatisyourlifepathnumberquiz/"">What Is Your Life Path Number?</a></div>

im always so tired lately. its weird because i usually dont sleep too much or take naps. but like friday i fell asleep at 5p.m. and woke up at like 6 saturday. and every night this weekend i have fallen asleep before 9:00. and i sleep most of the day and i never do that and it makes me want to sleep even more and then i hate myself for sleeping so much and wasting all my time but im always so darn tired. and its not like i would be doing anything better with my time if i weren't sleeping.

i think im going though serious oc+reunion withdrawal. and its only been the first week without it:( i dont know what im going to do with myself until november.

You are soft-spoken Lena! You are a gifted artist as beautiful as her drawings. You come upon unexpected romance in unlikely places. Lena is known as the beauty of the group-much to your own dismay. You'd prefer that people appreciate you for your art. If they have to notice her at all, that is.

first we went for a walk around the chenango area to morgans house. But she wasnt home cuz she was too busy havin a baby or something. Then we went to greg abbeys door....but not really. Next we walked by the gitchell's and we were very tempted to jump in(in the pool of course). It was so hott and we were all like""go down sun!"" and we asked an old man(not mr petley) to spray us with his hose and he looked at us like we were freaks. then we listened to ""funky"" ringtones on my new celly which i dropped on the ground but its all goos. ohhh and before we walked to morgans we saw sean drive by and were all like ....""he drives?""Then someone drove by and rac rac like""act natural......SPRINKLERS!"" then we almost jumped in some sprinklers but it was actually a man holdin a hose. so it was soooooooo hott that we walked back to rac racs to make some ice tea. a pitcher called for 16 scoops of tea stuff and i put in only 2 and was like"" eww y does it taste like water?"" and then in all the excitement rac rac spilled/broke her glass and a moose had to come pick it up. her dad also made a whole chicken for the 2 of us for din din....and we didnt eat any. and for the time bein were here.

Today, you'll reflect on recent events and visualize what will happen next. You're usually relaxed at this time of year, but you may not want to miss an opportunity to further your career or your social standing. A Sagittarius you meet now could inspire you to take a class that changes your life. Do it!

and joe don is even hotter in person but i hate hate hate his hair its all curly now i was like whaat thats weird and it doesnt suit you at all. god hes hott.psheww
we changed our seats like 10 trillion times because everytime i sat down there was either a pole or an 8 ft tall guy right in front of me. then we ended up sitting RIGHT behind the 4 hottest guys i have ever seen together in my whole life. like for real. i was like yesss lets sit hereee
it was awesome. andd i could see. they were frat boys it was so cute. and i was particularly obsessed with one. it was cool because we were like the two that were the most obsessed so everytime a weird song came on that most people didnt know the words to he'd turn around and we'd sing it together. i have tons of pictures of him because well duh he was right there so whenever i took one he was in it. he even posed for a couple because i think he caught on that i was partly taking them of him haha. he took one of me with his phone too. he was so nice. and a terrible dancer but thats ok because it was cute. aww i love frat boysss. errrr i wish i was olderr. like 17 or 18. he was 19. only 4 years difference though! thats not too bad. ghdfghdfuui i miss him so much and guess what im never going to see him again!!!!!!! noooooo:( i wish my parents werent right there. 

anywayss
got a little side tracked theree

it was so not disappointing at all and my throat hurts reallyy bad right now and i can't talk. but they didnt sing skin and that makes me mad because thats like my 4th favorite song of theirs. omg there was this group of boys there they were probably like 16 and every one of them looked like someone from our grade. it reminded me of that episode of arthur ahahaha. like one of them looked just like nick and one looked like max one looked like jud and one looked like steven. i was like woahhh thats crazyy 

and we almost got into an accident on the way out haha. and we were driving right behind their bus for like ever. i hate tinted windows so much boo they ruin everything.
oh and it was blake sheltons birthday so we sang to him and gave him a cake? it was strange. hes a cuttie
so is his guitar player.

it doesnt feel like it at all though
probably because i have to go back tomorrow at like the same time. no earlier(review session thingy)
i wish i was sabrina the teenage witch so i could like put a spell on myself and get hundreds without studying

errr hes making me so sadd! i want to know whats wrong:(

ok people just really piss me off sometimes.especially teenage girls that think they can say whatever they want about someone else and not hurt their feelings. like its not going to depress someone if theyre constantly talked about behind their backs or made fun of. and im not saying i've never done this before because i definitely have but i just wish people could take a hint once in a while.

"event","on friday night morgan went crazy because she called jbo.thats right she really did it. and im so proud. but the thing is he wasnt home:( and she was going to call him again later and ask if he wanted to go to a movie with us but that plan didnt work out so i went to see madagascar with a+s instead. and the movie was really disappointing. and short. 
then  we went home and slept at mandas but we didnt do much because we crashed like as soon as we got in the door. well i did anyway. and mean girls is the funniest movie ever. only if you're us though.

today we went to the lake but it was kind of boring. i read the whole time and played chess with dad. and i didnt even get a tan because it wasnt sunny. then we went to my papa's grave with my grandma and aunt. then i took a walk around the lake with my mother. then we went home. oh and i saw the kid next door but hes totally blahh i was like eww how did we like him how?? people that have dogs named windsor are just out of the question im sorry.and also i saw joey+jen+tommy<3<3 my buds from the olden times. it was so weird and i felt really old.

yeah that was pretty much my super exciting weekend.i really dont want to go back to school. 11 more days wooo.

i need to update more. ew since when is it may?? when did that happen april went by wicked fast.hm last week was boring.me and amanda finally saw napoleon dynamite on friday because we decided that its pretty much impossible to survive in chenango forks without having seen that movie. we also baked a cake. haha because we felt like it. i watched hp1 last night it was on tv. and now i really want to read it again but im in the middle of another book so i have to finish that first because i dont like reading two books at once. i wish i was sick so i could skip this week because its gonna suck.i bet it will go by really slow but hopefully not. but dont get me wrong i am very much interested in what will happen with karon and andrew;)hahaa what were we on that night?

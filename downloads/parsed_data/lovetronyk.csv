"event","<font face=""Arial"" size=""2""><div align=""Justify"">What the hell am I supposed to think right now? I have no religion (which makes sense to me), but people dying just doesn't make sense. Between the hours of 4:00 and 6:00am this morning, my grandfather passed into the night... no more than 15 feet from me. This was the main reason we stayed down here. We're all happy that he made it through the holidays. It doesn't really matter what anyone says ""they are,"" we can all agree that my grandfather is better off they way he is now than in the pain he was only hours ago. Just to imagine how it must have felt having your body slowly fill with ammonia due to a non-functioning liver (among other things) must have been incredibly painful. The family is holding up well... surprisingly. A bit of crying from all parties concerned, but that's to be expected. We'll likely be going back home sometime this evening, so everything will end up fine.

The thing that absolutely threw me off the most was when my mom told me to go say goodbye to grandpa. That just doesn't make sense to me. All I could think is, ""grandpa isn't here right now... I said goodbye to him yesterday. I hugged him then, and even though he was probably not all-there mentally, he was still 'there.'"" I don't think dying is what people are really sad about... I think it's the fact that they'll never experience that person ever again. Just thinking about that makes me sad.</div></font>"

Wow, today was absolutely nuts! We (Devin and I) stayed up until 12:00am to wish Jane a happy birthday! She promptly went back to sleep, but it was still awesome. She then had the nerve to try to wake us up at 6:00am... where I promptly went back to sleep. Oh well. We left our house with my mom to come down here to Olympia at about 10:15 or so... It was rockin. We got down here and we were bored as hell... not to mention, Jane was really sad that she was spending her <b>18TH</b> birthday in an old folks home... so of course, we left. We went to the mall... we were bored there. So we went to find a slurpee... the gas stations here in Olympia suck mouse dick all day. You can't even walk into them! Fuck that, duder. So we eventually ended up at Petco (where the pets go). We saw some crazy lady talking to a parrot (whom we think was an employee, but that's still open to debate) and we looked around at the furry animals. Then it hit us (or mainly me... in the wallet), Jane should get some animals! Well.. which kind? After a startling 15 minutes of not very much debate, we ended up with 2 hamsters, now named Pockets and Zipper. Zipper cause it's a fast little chica who loves to run, and Pockets in remembrance of my Siberian Dwarf Hamster from the long long ago. We also bought this PHAT ($70) habitat that they can run around in.. and climb in.. and etc. in! We'll add onto it later, but it's already really obvious that they love it! We all piled into the Explorer and headed home, after a minor mishap of Devin losing one of the Hamsters under a seat. We pretty much just sat around and laughed at/played with the hamsters until about 9:30 when we went to Applebees and ate hella food. I'm still full and we left over an hour ago. We really needed to walk around somewhere (anywhere, really), but everything was closed (11:20 on a Sunday, go figure). Jane hit the bed and fell asleep, and Devin and I went up a massive flight of stairs to reach the old people's computers. Surprisingly, we're not currently being bitched out about using ""THEIR COMPUTERS ARRGHGHGHGH!!!"". Yep... so that's the day pretty much, and I guess it's over right about now. OH SHIT, I should really recap Christmas! I guess I can do that all in one post. Word.

So Christmas was really... non Christmasey. We pretty much got up, took showers, and picked up Devin from Auburn. We also stopped at my apartment and made a shitty mix CD for the ride home! When we finally got home at around 5:00, we opened presents and to my surprise, I actually got one! TWO actually! Here was the breakdown:

Jane:
- 10ft Scarf (from me!)
- 8ft Scarf and Matching Gloves (from me!)
- Zojirushi Rice Cooker (from me!)
- New Jeans (from me!)
- New Turtle Neck (from me!)
- New Pimpass White Jacket (from me!)
(and adding in today's findings)
- 2 Hamsters (from me!)
- Phattttty Hamster Habitat (w/ food and etc. shit) (from me!)
- Pink Pajamas (from m&d)
- Mix CD (from Devin)

Me:
- $20 Wal-mart Gift Card
- $20 Sweater (and it wasn't even on sale, but it's still a nice sweater)
- Fondue Maker (WORD!!) (from Devin)

Aye... they said as you get older, you get less presents..... but I feel ripped off. Not to mention that it didn't even fell like Christmas. Oh well, next year will be better, and I'm really looking forward to this Summer the most, anyway.
Oh, and my parents have been promising me a laptop for the last 2 years, so I finally decided that I would go ahead and make a cheap one. We're gonna just use the business account and go through dell. For $1200 I'm getting a 1.4Ghz Pentium M/512Mb DDR/128MB Radeon 6800 <b>ProTurbo</b>/40Gb HDD/Wireless and yeah, that's good enough for me. It'll run what I need it to (and should run HL2 at least decent if I want that too). Kinda fun... I guess I can consider that a christmas present too, and now I'm rich! HAHA, bitches! Not that my parents aren't already paying for my insurance/gas/apartment/tuition... I'm already getting special treatment. Okay, no more ripped off feeling.

Goddamn my journal entries are boring! No wonder no one posts on them! I need to include pictures since I kno non'yall niggas can read.</div></font>"

"event","<font size=""2"" face=""Arial""><div align=""Justify"">Wow, today was pretty much crazy. We woke up this morning and Jane was in a lot of pain, but decided to go to work anyway. She ended up going to work for a few hours, but called me to wake up at about 10:30 so I could take her to her doctor. I was supposed to just work on my car at home today while Jane was at work. Oddly enough, about the time I was supposed to drive up to Burlington to pick up my new Tien S-Tech (The Dress-Up Master!) springs, I needed to go take Jane back to Everett for her impromptu appointment. Luckily, my dad made the journey up north and picked them up for me. We basically just sat around having fun at the doctor's office until everything was taken happy, drugs were administered, and more subsequent fun magically manifested itself. Actually, I'm lying... drugs are bad and shit. Anyways, Jane feels better and I just finished working on my car (it's 11:30 now!). I really need to reinstall the Do-Luck aero kit, but I just don't feel like washing my car 30 minutes from midnight. Anyways, the S-Tech stance is nice and there's nearly no body roll now. Much better than ricey chopped springs.
Well... I'm gonna go get some sleep. I got paiddddd for the Japanese PS2 today, so I need to ship it to Denmark tomorrow. Very limited sleep... that sucks. Working 3:00-11:30 pm tomorrow, so I'll never sleep again, until tomorrow night. Wow, I have a strange feeling that this post makes A LOT less sense than was intended. Awwwwww shiiiiittt...

"event","<font size=""2"" face=""Arial""><div align=""Justify"">Alright, I'm almost there! I dug up a couple of you bastards (anyone else who sees this, add me if you know me) and now I feel like I need to actually type something. So this quarter was totally fucking awesome. I love Seattle and I love the UW! It's like some kinda fucked up affair... or something. I've actually started playing with my car a bit... but I need to sell it! For those of you that still have no clue, I'm getting married this summer, and it's time to find something I won't piss money into... also something the soon-to-be wifey can drive. Oh well, someday when I actually have a job and money, I can get another one. I'll probably work on it tomorrow though... I need to re-rice it so some kid that reads (and is obsessed with) SUPERSTREET will freak out and pay me $4500. Isn't it absolutely awesome? Don't worry, pics will be online probably tomorrow. Oh and what else? Jane's Christmas present showed up today... I'll tell everyone what it is after she finds out! It's hardly likely that I won't add her, and that would just suck if I basically told her. I also sold my Japanese PS2 w/ 52 games today... for only $350! I feel like I sorta ripped myself off. Oh well, I only played like, 3 of the games anyway. But damn.. I'm hella itching for some half-life action, so I'm gonna go shoot some shit. Hopefully I'll see some of you over break (in beween working......). Peaceeeeeeeee</div></font>"

"event","<font size=""2"" face=""Arial""><div align=""Justify"">Yeah, I finally decided to hook up a livejournal... it's halfway to pointless. It sucks cause I have like, zero customization options... and I refuse to pay for this. I man, c'mon... why would ANYONE actually pay to have a journal online? Anyways, this shit is pretty much just for keeping in contact with alla yall bitches off at other colleges. I don't always have time to talk to you guys online, and it'll be nice to see what ur up to. I'll prolly also use this just for ranting and posting shit about my car... who knows how many people it will reach? Anyways, I'll probably post something else later so I can actually see how my limited settings will format my entries. Oh shit, and I need to find some friends to add so someone will actually read this. Anyways, that's all. BTW: You suck.</div></font>"

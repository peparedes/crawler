Anyhow, this week is ADM week for our kids, so they get to dress in crazy things for school instead of uniforms...Today was crazy sports wear and we had one little boy come in a full mini Browns uniform. SO CUTE!!

Sometimes I think my one class needs to be like all made into satellite people because they drive me nuts!! Oh, if you don't know what a satellite person is...I'll explain...basically they get moved away from the rest of the group for various reasons.

Anyhow, it's hard to believe that I'll be leaving one school to go to another for student teaching this month...I kinda wish I could stay. I have to learn double the names and I don't really want to teach high school. Oh well, jump through the hoops right.

So excited to hear that my best friend is engaged! Gotta make sure that I'm in the states Fall 07 so that I can be there. SO EXCITED!!!"

"event","So, it's been quite the interesting week. We had a new teacher move into our ""office"". I should clarify what constitutes our office...it's composed of a sectioned off area of the gym that has desks for four teachers and me. Well, I don't really have a desk, but it's still crowded. Moving on, Tuesday was Open House, but not like most people think of Open House. Because of budget cuts and other reasons Open House is during certain hours of the day and the parents come and watch. It's the strangest open house I've ever seen and I don't know how much it really accomplishes. For some reason I've felt extremely tired this week and am looking forward to relaxing this weekend. 

Can't wait for Friday night, cause I'm having a bonfire at my parents house with a few of my friends. Just the perfect time to talk about the week, since Angie and Carrie are TA in for their professor. Maybe I'm glad that I'm not working on my Master's yet. We talk about lessons and stupid students because we all have our fair share of students that have silly moments. 

I've been working on my pseudo apt. at my Gram's in the basement. Once it's all fixed up and finished it has everything minus a kitchen. I definitely like the setup. I think my kitty, Spaz, likes it even more because he has freedom to run around and do whatever he wants down there. Minus clawing the furniture, which equals purple spray bottle of water. The nicest part about all of it is that I can work from home some nights down there. I like the ability to work on my own things and do work. I get so much more accomplished that way."

"event","So I was sitting here this evening thinking about so many things...thinking about things that I would change if I were given the opportunity. Thinking about how I can accept the things that are whether or not I like them. I guess what it all boils down to is that I know I've learned from the mistakes I've made. I didn't realize that my voice changes depending on whom I've spoken with on the phone that day, but apparently it does. I didn't realize that I sound happier when I talk to one person in particular...I doubt he even realizes it himself. I know that more than one person mentioned it to me this evening.

I had a great day. Went to the christening for Anthony Michael...cutest little boy ever. It was a great afternoon spent with some wonderful people. I was so glad that I was invited to be a part of it. It was the first time I've sat down and talked to my mother this week, so that was nice as well.  Jo Jo gave me hugs before I left...they're hysterical because he runs at you and jumps...almost knocked me over the one time. It was just a day to sit back and relax and enjoy my day.

Couldn't believe that I spoke to ""you"" today...it was interesting. If you only knew the things that I was thinking or the things I still have questions about. Someday, somewhere, all will be understood."

"event","Well, I guess that I should start this off by saying that I don't think it's a terrible thing for people to know how you are feeling. What's wrong with wearing your heart on your sleeve? Yes, there are some things that definitely should be kept inside for only a select few people to know or understand, but other things don't really matter. Why not let everyone know that you're having a really hard time with your life at the moment. It can't hurt to have a little bit of help here and there. 

I can't try to be someone I'm not and hiding the things I feel inside would be trying to be someone I'm definitely not. Granted no one knows the extent of the things I feel and that's the way it shall stay because parts of this are meant for no one else, but one person. That person knows who they are and when they are ready will be able to listen to the things that I have to say. There's nothing wrong with loving someone with all that you are nor is there anything wrong with going wherever in life with all your heart.

How I wish that I could make you understand that and understand the things I've done and the things I would change...unfortunately there are no easy answers in life."

Highlight of the evening was definitely when Pam smacked my a$$ and when I went to get her back managed to trip herself. I was laughing so hard. Also, Corey's story about getting gas and the price changing while she was filling up her car and the owner of the station heard her use every curse in the book. That was hysterical and Tawdy was laughing so hard she was crying. Best memories of a formal meeting ever.

Note to self: pilates and body sculpting all in one day is a bad idea. It equals very, very sore body. Didn't want to drag myself out of bed for State Day today at all.

Why does it have to go from beautiful to gross and snowing all in one week! Seriously I've about had it with the crappy Ohio weather. I'm ready to wear spring clothes not winter coats and gloves. It certainly would be nice if it was like Tuesday or Wednesday again...minus that scary comment by the construction workers outside the rec center. I think it's creepy to tell someone, ""Hey, that looks like your exwife walking down the side walk."" WHO SAYS THAT!!! It definitely made me want to run very, very quickly away from them. What a bunch of weirdos! I can't wait until I can go places with Rich because then I won't have to deal with creepy men! WOO for having a totally hot boyfriend! :)

He makes me smile because he was being so cute about it. I guess everyone skips class for a reason...maybe that's why I can't sleep on nights that I get to talk to him the next morning. If I had gone to class I wouldn't have gotten to talk to him on Thursday.

Let's see...Thursday night was quite entertaining. Went out with Jen to Scorekeeper's and met a bunch of Jay's friends. All her work friends were there as well, so it was like 4 girls and lots of boys. I definitely heard one of the stupidest pick up lines ever! Who seriously says...I think your glasses are hot. PUH-LEASE I was like you have to be kidding me. I laughed so hard...so did the guys when I told them about that comment. Atleast I know they're all realtively normal and don't use stupid lines like that...granted I've heard them use dumb lines, but that takes the cake I think.

Friday...spent the evening with my friend Grenfell, my dad, and bro. We all went to Applebee's for dinner and talked. It was enjoyable.

Saturday...Jay and I made Jen wait on us HA HA HA! She had to serve us...lol. I seriously find that amusing because she has to be the laziest girl I know. I was also told by Jay that he couldn't believe how much I eat...I definitely spent $30 on myself for dinner LOL. He said I'm not shy about eating...who would be with three brothers. Jen's one manager is definitely teradactyl material...what a dinosaur. :) Also cutting myself off from shopping at the Limited.

1. It likes to turn itself on and off randomly...it generally decides that it wants to stay off when it turns itself on and off the majority of the time.

2. This is the replacement for my original phone and it's worse than the original.

3. Everyone likes a phone that has almost completely cracked in half without ever having been dropped. Since I've only had the replacement phone for about 2 months.

4. It's even better to have a flip phone that you can't shut because the swivel (hinge thing) is the part that has cracked completely on both sides.

5. If that doesn't irritate you, then it's even better when your phone decides it doesn't want to ring or let you hear the person who is trying to talk to you....especially when it's a phone call from Korea.

6. After two months of a crappy phone...finally convince the rep that they should replace the phone...getting the next model up! HOORAY"

Either way, I'm glad I got my copy of Rascal Flatts cause it totally made my day. It was a nice surprise...not expecting it. Yay and thanks! :) I listened to it before I went to sleep. On a side note...these beds are definitely only made to fit one...but it's cool little. I love you!"

There's no more air
Trippin' over myself
Goin' nowhere

I saw you

It's alright

I daresay that I think I'm getting addicted to the show House on tv. I find it very compelling to watch...sorry Jay that I didn't want to talk until after the show, but there were only 15 minutes left. 

Speaking of conversations it can be quite entertaining to play 20 questions with people especially if you don't know them really well. This week seems to be slowly dragging on and on...wish it would hurry up and be Friday already.

Oh, and don't forget Senior Show Feb. 25th 5-8pm at the Gallery in Kliest...which if you don't know is on the right side of Bagley Road after the football stadium."

"event","Gosh, it's been the craziest week ever I swear! Well, I should say past four days because unfortunately it's still only Tuesday. So let's see a brief recap of my weekend would go something like this...

Friday - drive home with what I think is all my stuff. Realize at 9 pm that night...I forgot my beret and pills...SHIT! Thus commencing to drive another 45 minutes back to BW with my annoying little brother because by the time I left home it was like 10:15 or so. Let's just say he was not a pleasant passenger either coming back to school or going back home. Wasting not only my gas, but an hour and a half of my time...and it only gets better from there.

Saturday - well, let's see went to bed at midnight (technically Sat morn.) phone call at 1:30 from Jen...don't talk because I'm sleeping. Phone call at 4:30 from Rich to tell me that they're making him tryout for SRT. Damn the Army...I can't deal with that...another year in Korea if he makes it and signs the contract. No WAY! It's hard enough already and right now it's at the 8 month mark. Wake up at 6 am to be at drill at 7 am...freezing cold outside....brr. Gotta love a one star coming to drill...it means everyone's watching you...dressed in full gear except for lunch. Did I mention my weapon is all rusty and sandy. Of course we get held late because officers like to talk...totally sucks and completely exhausted from having to lay in a pile of rocks and wet leaves for two hours pretending it's a foxhole and all that jazz. Don't get done until late...

Sunday - wake up 6:15 am because I hit snooze once...love feeling like I got hit by a vehicle...namely a truck. Forgotten how irritating kevlar is, but it keeps you safe. PT in the icy parking lot...surprised no one fell on their behind. Practice gate security stuff until team leader says you need to go in because you're too cold...that's no lie. My hands were starting to turn funny colors even with gloves on. Atleast we got to leave a little earlier than yesterday, but still have to go home...pack up the car with my things and do laundry so my mom doesn't get mad. Best part of the night...HOT SHOWER! 

Monday - Woo sucky Valentine's Day...nough said

Tuesday - Two tests...who does that. Go figure and the weekend that I can't really study for them either...I really hope I didn't do as badly as I think I did. Highlight of the day the 15 minute nap when I went tanning...relaxing."

This weekend proves to be one where I'll have absolutely no time for myself. Gotta love drill weekends...well, actually I don't mind them...it means I get paid and get to do something I love. Besides it means Grenfell has to spend the weekend with me...I know you miss me so much Jay...ha ha ha. You're an addition to the 3 brothers I already have, but that's why it works out so well. Besides Kondis is an annoying person and his mouth will be duct taped if I get stuck sitting anywhere near him on a plane again. 

Recruiters are oh so interesting...I still can't believe someone could possibly be dumb enough to marry Fitzwater. That could possible be one of the worst mistakes anyone could make...lol. In the words of another...this wife is his pet project...she had nothing before. Oh, so she's pretty much happy with anything...ha ha that's really funny. My recruiter gives it oh about a year at the most and I'd have to agree.

Next week is when all the madness hits the fan...look out here comes hanging everything for the senior show. AGH!!!!! For those of you interested in attending...Feb. 25th is the opening in the Gallery at Kliest from 5-8...there will be food, so you should come check out everyone's work and eat. I think there are 7 or 8 seniors exhibiting their work, so it will definitely be interesting. If you are wondering where I am next week...I'll probably be living at Kliest trying to get everything situated for the show. 

If setting up the show weren't enough, two tests on Tuesday next week as well....YUCK! Especially when they are critical thinking and natural geography...well, I'm off to work on stuff at Kliest...it's my second home I swear."

"event","The best way to wake up on a Monday morning is when Rich calls me and talks for a half hour. Definitely excited about that because I get to talk to him on rare occassions. I have to say that he's good at being difficult on purpose, but he makes me smile. I guess that he's going to try to volunteer to get stationed with Ott, but if that's not possible his first choice is Ft. Hood. I'm really hoping he gets Ft. MacPherson (sp?) because I can easily drive there...Texas not so much.

I found an awesome sticker for the card I am making him it says...

The One I Love

I used to dream about the one
who would someday be mine.
The one I'd live with and love
together always, rain or shine.

But my dreams couldn't compare
with who you came to be...
you're my heart, my secret keeper
and best of all friends to me.

I'll love you till the Earth stands still
and the stars lose all their glow...
When you hold my hand, I'm safe
I love you more than you'll ever know.

Hmmm...gotta go get those pictures reprinted today, so I can finish the card. Love my aunt for helping out with some of the supplies I needed and some creative advice. Wish I didn't have to go to class today, but it's not too bad...only one class and work."

"event","I daresay the best wake up in the morning is a phone call from Rich. Atleast I can say that I'm not as sick as he is at the moment, but it is strange that we are both sick. He did make me laugh this morning when he said if he were home he'd have massaged my ears to make them feel better. It's a funny thought and he was trying to make me feel better. I had to laugh because he was totally overanalyzing what to send my dad...Richard, Richard, Richard....""WHAT?!"" Stop thinking about it too much...it's my dad he'll like whatever you send him. lol. Atleast I know he cares what my father's opinion of him is...unlike the time I accidentally gave Dennis my dad's number...poor Dennis woke my father up and he wasn't very pleasant about that. Although, he never did mention it to me...lol. 

The boy that cares about your father's opinion is definitely a keeper because the last one (the asshole) didn't care what my parents thought. I would much rather my parents like the guy I'm dating and in the present case, they love him. Perfect I'd say and he is always trying to make me smile. :D Still don't know what kind of dress he bought me, but when you work 14 days and get one off and are really sick, I don't really expect the dress anytime soon. I'd be sleeping on my day off too. The plus to this situation only 145 more days! Less than 5 months until he's stateside, which will be wonderful! I'm definitely excited and he's going to armor school, which means he'll be happier...no more working the roads with a stupid Katusa corporal, whom I would want to punch too if I had to work with a lazy ass.

"event","Well, this weekend was quite the interesting one. I went to a combat lifesaver class and learned how to take care of all kinds of wounds and put in an IV. Considering I am terrified of being stuck with needles I think that I did a good job. SSG Oberlin said he thought about screaming just to freak me out even though I didn't hurt him. I think that would have terrified me if he had actually done that. The classes were from Friday evening to Sunday morning and then we got our card that says we are certified to carry a combat lifesaver pack. Basically that means I have more things to carry equipmentwise in the field. Things like bandages, atropein, and stuff to put in IVs. 

Got to talk to Rich on Friday morning and it was great. I'm so glad he loved what I sent for his birthday. I miss him so much, but there are only 147 days left! :) Can't wait...gonna be the best time ever when he comes home!"

"event","Hmmm....where to begin. Well, let's see over break I've seen quite a few movies to include National Treasure, The Incredibles, Meet the Fockers, and Ocean's 12. Don't waste your money on Ocean's 12 because it was quite stupid...I would say my little's in agreement there. We went to Chammps and the movies that day and it was quite disappointing because the first one was good. The Incredibles was the result of Grenfell and my rocks, paper, scissors...I won so I didn't want to see the scary movie...ha ha ha...poor G. National Treasure was Christmas Day with the fam, we went to a movie and that was about it...nothing much, just a day of relaxing.

On Wed. I went up to North Olmsted to spend the evening with Rich's mom and Tony. Well, the roads weren't too bad until I got to Brunswick and that's when I realized yet again that my car isn't getting warm. It's in the shop now because that's a problem especially in the winter. Anyhow, I was only supposed to go for dinner, but with the roads being as terrible as they were, I stayed the night. It was fun...homemade soup...yum. Then Rich's mom said she had a few things for me for Christmas because I haven't seen her since before Christmas. Well, I didn't think anything of it just that she had something little for me. She gave me the cutest pink tank top from Victoria's Secret...which is my favorite store! Then there was this little box on the table all wrapped up and she said it was from Rich. I was like what?! So I opened it and he got me a beautiful diamond necklace for Christmas. I wished so badly that I could have called him right after I opened it, because I love it! His mom also gave me a copy of one of my favorite pictures of him in a frame...new centerpiece for my desk at school! WOO HOO! I can't wait until he comes home! June's not that far away...a little less than 6 months.

Thursday I went to lunch with my father and grandfather at the Mustard Seed and ran into two people I haven't seen in quite awhile...not the ones that you avoid either. LOL I saw Matt who used to go to BW and a boy that was a year older than me in high school. Crazy where you run into people...but then again that's life. I also painted the hallway down to the basement for my mom and was pleasantly interrupted by a few texts from Rich. Best way to end a day for sure. Hope everyone else had a great break and I'm sure going to miss the study abroad girls this semester. So much closer to not having to go to school anymore...woo hoo. Who knows what the future has to offer...just got to take it one day at a time."

I had 100, mom 54, and Christopher 29. I'd say that's a decent margin of defeat...we had a good time playing though. This Christmas was relatively quiet, but I enjoyed it because we weren't really busy or anything. It's strange though when someone isn't home. My brother is stationed at Ft. Lewis and wasn't able to come home for Christmas. 

We went to see National Treasure as a family after a day of playing games and lounging around...eating left overs from Christmas Eve when the whole family was over. My Aunt Laurie didn't know who Rich was, so the albums were brought out from training and the album I have of he and I. They all think he's good looking, so I guess you could say that's the family seal of approval or some such thing. I'm glad though because they didn't like the last one as much...not that they hated him either. He just made a few comments here and there that weren't good ones to say in front of parents. 

I did get a few neat things for Christmas though...the usually Christmas ornament...a snowman this year, but I got a special one as well. I got one that was special as well. It was an ornament with four servicemembers on it and it has a flag that can be raised and lowered by a little wheel on the bottom. I thought it was pretty neat. I got a few watercolor pencils and charcoal pencils as well...good stuff.

It was definitely nice to go out with some friends and do something entertaining. Minus the icy roads of course, because the drive to Valley View is a bit long from Akron. Oh well, time well spent in the company of friends.

A certain Pi Lam, by the name of Billy Bachman, owes me a chicken dance. Ah yes, and now it is in writing so it must happen. Of course, payment is sometime when Lauren can watch him look silly as well. Yes, that is the payment required for getting your butt kicked in a game of checkers! Like I said before...Prepare to Die...Kill Bill...lol! :)

In other news, my mother told me not to wear clothes today because I had to do so much laundry when I came home...she helped a little. I guess that's her approval to run around naked...j/k. Although, I'm sure it would shock her if I told her that...I think it goes along with her and Rich's mom talking about grandchildren. She said,""I was at this sale and there were tons of little girl clothes, it would have been great if I had a granddaughter."" Me,""Oh, so sorry that's not happening any day soon!"" Do you think they are pushing the envelope? I certainly think they are....books on planning weddings, asking what I want...etc. They are awful!"

I didn't even get the chance to tell them I was, but who cares I didn't have to waste my whole day sitting there.

Best part of this morning was talking to Rich for 35 or so minutes. I definitely wasn't expecting his phone call, but it was perfect timing because I couldn't sleep and was thinking about him. My quote of the conversation...I better get a ring before you get another tatoo...especially if you are going to get something huge. I really, really don't want him to get another tatoo...especially a huge one on is back. 

I can't complain too much because I got to talk to him!!! He said it the best by, you can't possibly send me the things that I need. I am stuck here in Korea and what I want is very, very far away. Oh how well I understand that. Bright side to this story....6 months down...6 to go! Just wait until you come home...he he he...I'm kidnapping you! Debating where to, maybe down to Mohican to go canoeing and from there who knows. I guess it'll depend on when I have to go to AT and how much money I can save for when he comes home. Then...why did you buy me(Rich) something for my birthday! I told you not to. Like I'm really going to listen to that...not like I bought something insane or crazy to send to Korea...more practical things that can be used no matter what.

Finally go my phone replaced. Now it can't turn itself on and off on its own or search for service every 5 minutes. That makes me happy. Almost finished with my puzzle that my parents got me for my birthday. That was one of the goals for break besides getting some of my work framed and finishing up the work on the basement. We'll see how far I get on all that good stuff."

Oh well, I enjoyed seeing Mallory, whom I haven't seen in quite some time! Kenderes does not have better boobs than any of the girls...he is sadly mistaken. He also likes to burst through doors and scare people, which at 2:30 in the morning is really annoying. Especially when all you want to do is fall asleep and sleep until you feel better. Love the Pi Lams!!"

Olah,""Did you really get pooped on by pigeons?"" ""Yes, Katie, and this homeless woman was hitting on my dad...she was on narcotics of some kind...if I had to take a guess I would say crack."" Gotta love the conversations on the way to class.

Best birthday ever this year...I got tons of cool things from Richie! He sent me Korean food and candy, this really pretty robe, and a lamp. Obviously, all made in Korea because that's where he is and I love the presents. By the way, Korean candy is much better than American candy...AND HOW! My parents made me cry because they were gone for my birthday, but they left me things on the counter. This book called I hope you dance and a new puzzle with horses. I love my puzzles...on Thanksgiving they gave me a matching necklace and earrings that are pink fresh water pearls....really pretty! I'm still in shock with what Rich's mom gave me...I can't believe she gave me the necklace that she did...it's beautiful. My aunt gave me this jewelry box that apparently keeps your silver jewelry from tarnishing...I've never seen anything like that. The best things are knowing that everyone loves me and spending time with the family. Not to mention getting to talk to Rich for an hour the other day because that happens maybe once a month if I am lucky. Man do I wish he was home.

Maybe, just maybe he will be in April to go to my formal. If not then for sure when he PCSes to wherever in June. I don't care as long as I get to kidnap him for a day...no parents, no cell phones, no nothing, just the two of us. I think that's pretty reasonable considering it's been five months already since the last time I saw him.

In other news, the paper that I didn't think I did well on...I got a B, so that makes me happy because I don't think it was very well written. One less thing to worry about, so here's to worrying about teaching this week because I don't know much about study skills....arg."

"event","Where to begin...well, Saturday was the good, bad, and the ugly. The good being that I got promoted to Specialist! The ugly being we got OC (pepper sprayed)direct contact the same day. The bad that I had to pretend to be perfectly fine around my family after being pepper spray. Word of advice...if you ever do something stupid enough to be arrested for, don't fight because the pepper spray really hurts...for about an hour. The first fifteen minutes are by far the worst though.

The most fun of the entire weekend was getting to tell my little who I am! YEAH, I have a little!!!! WOO HOO! She's awesome by the way! I heart Danielle! Even better her favorite color is blue too! Perfect I think!

In other news, Rich didn't forget my birthday, however, what ever he is sending me from Korea will no arrive in time for my birthday. I'm not upset because he's sending me something...what it is I have no idea...I'll keep you posted on what I get...provided it's something that can be shared...never know with that boy! I LOVE him very much though!"

"event","Well, certain persons felt that I needed to update the journal in regards to the boyfriend. As most of you know, Mike is ancient history...dead and gone (figuratively). (YAY! - Ashley) If you are wondering the comments are Ashley...the coolest little sister anyone could ever have :) So it seems, this will be a joint entry into this journal with more than one point of view...which is always a good thing. Now on to the topic of my boyfriend.

WE LOVE RICH.......ALOT! AND WE MISS HIM AND WISH HE COULD BE HERE WITH US, BUT 200 AND SOME ODD DAYS WILL GO BY FAST! Well, I have an awesome boyfriend even if I haven't seen him in four months...doesn't make life easy that's for sure. He's great though, makes me feel like a princess when he is home. What more could a girl ask for, seriously. He's my Abercrombie boy hands down and I love him very much. I can't believe he's going to be 25 in January. Not nearly as big of an age gap as before which is much, much better. Besides he acts like an adult unlike aformentioned people. 

Well, I don't exactly know what else to talk about because so many of you have heard all the stories...I supposed you could just ask any questions that you may have and I'll tell you my answer."

"event","As it has been ages since I've taken the time to update my journal, I suppose I should give a brief run through of recent events. Have you ever had a teacher that is completely mean about you missing a class? Well, I have on that's being like that now...the best part is that no matter what I would have missed the class it's just for one reason instead of another. Personally, I think my brother graduating from training at Ft. Benning is very important and I'm surpising him. He doesn't know I'm coming...ha ha ha! Other reason I wouldn't have been there is because of drill with my unit and I would have been gone those days. Seems the professor just doesn't understand and can't figure out that I'm not rich and can't afford to waste the money I spent on my plane ticket...arggg!

In other news, BW likes to screw all the seniors...imagine that. Well, this school is the biggest pain in the arse ever! Have to go talk to three different offices before they'll release a flag from your account to register. Then after you take care of that you realize that class(es) you need are completely full. Here's to hoping that I can get signed into the class that I need. Seems as though many of the seniors are having the same problem or BW has just decided not to offer the classes we need to graduate. I know I don't want to be here any longer than I have to be and neither does anyone else.

Then to add to the list, my wonderful boyfriend is stationed in Korea and I have absolutely no way to contact him except letters, but those take freaking ten days to get to him. I think the frustration in this area is quite overwhelming at the moment, because I've need to reach him recently and haven't been able to talk to him at all. AGHHHHHHHH! I love Richie though, he's a great guy...even if he drives me crazy at times.

Can't wait for this semester to stop being so crazy busy so that I can relax. Going to spend my Thanksgiving break writing a paper for a class that I really don't like, but that's the way school goes unfortunately."

"event","Well, it seems as though it's been so long since I've actually updated this thing. I guess that's what happens when you leave for 4 months of military training and have little to no contact with the outside world.

 I've seen so many changes since I left in January. I broke up with my boyfriend of a year and a half because he wasn't mature enough to handle the situation. I feel that I have become a strong person in my beliefs and can more readily stand up for what I believe. I found this amazing person while I was away and have been given the privilege to learn more in the past month. I've met the person I feel is my soulmate and the next year will prove to be a challenge. I can't believe that Korea is so incredibly far away.

 To all my Phi Mu sisters that graduated I wish you the best of luck and congratulations on graduating from BW. 
 As time permits I am going to write little bits about my training experiences and memories."

"event","Well, since I haven't seen the majority of the people who can read this I figured I should update it. Here's the scoop at the present time. Mike broke up with me and to be honest it doesn't really bother me at the moment. I mean I am leaving in like 5 days to be gone for 5 months at basic training. I haven't had a good night's sleep except if you count yesterday. I think I'm ready to move on with my life and it doesn't mean that he has to be in my life. Why would I want to date someone who breaks up with me and gives me back everything I ever gave him minus like two things. Pretty immature if you ask me and that's what I think he is. I think leaving for the time is going to be the best thing that has happened in quite sometime. Going to miss all my Phi Mu sisters, but you can always write to me. If someone doesn't have my address just get in touch with my parents at 1381 Lakeland Ave. Akron, OH 44320."

"event","All I want to do today is sleep. First because I am tired and sore from drill. Second because the weather outside stinks. Any how, my first drill wasn't too bad. I survived and am just sore from doing push ups on Saturday and then Sargeant Van Sykle's house of pain. ""House of pain"" is really just a bunch of different pt exercises, but when you've never done them or aren't very good at it...well it's definitely pain. I think the best part of the whole weekend was squad football...I'm in first squad. It was 1 and 2 against 3 and 4. We won. 

I'm starting to wish that I liked Ponderosa more because that's the lunch spot for drill weekends. The food is ok, but I'm really not a buffet type of person for the most part. I'd much rather sit down and order a meal and eat that."

"event","Well, I didn't really have time to update my journal this summer because I was busy watching two kids Monday through Friday. When you have to watch kids from 7 in the morning until 5 at night, lots of things don't get finished. I didn't really have that interesting of a summer for the most part because I worked everyday. I did do something that everyone is pretty much shocked about. I joined the army reserve and I leave for boot camp on Jan. 13th. You guessed it, that means I will be missing the spring semester here at good old BW. I have 17 weeks of basic and job training ahead of me, but I am very excited about it all.

This year I'm living on the floor with Liana. I have the best roomie in the whole world. I suppose it also helps that we are about the same places in our lives with boyfriends, school, and working. Well, I think that pretty much sums up what I did this summer."

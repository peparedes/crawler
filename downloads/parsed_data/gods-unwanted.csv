"event","today and yesterday were the worst days of my life i swear. fuck, see i swear. lol. Anyways first me and chas went out on the paddle boat and were we screwing around fishing, fighting,and scaring 3 three kids and yelling at them. Anyways we were so far away from the beach and lighting strikes ripping  through the sky and thunder booms and chasiti is afraid so shes flipping out and i just kept going towards the marina cuz its fun. So we had to turn around and go back. We got there and i walked up to my house and left chas with the boat in the rain (lol) but when i got there my brother didnt wanna go out in the rain, so i walked back and we dragged the boat really far up and tipped it over. We got back to my house and chas was worried about her fucking dog. i love her dogs dont get me wrong but she was fine when we got there and in the mean time i had called my mom and asked if i could go to her house (she said yes) and matt (my other brother) went and tied up the boat. So it was fine but my mom called and started complaining how im iresponsable blah blah blah the usual. So i slept over chas's house and she was grumpy all night and i woke up with her foot in my mouth ewww. So today i got home late cuz me and chas slept in till like 12:46 so my mom was made cuz i was home at like 6:14 so she was so angry. Then i sat in my room and cried for 2 hours ate supper and im here now. I realized my whole life is a lie and nothing is worth living anymore and so much more but, im too tired if i dont update in a few days i've probably ran away or killed myself and no one has found me yet. if u wanna talk to me (if im still alive) im me at Dabubbles or mail me at XXdabubblesXx@aol.com kk byezz 4 eva (mayb)


my birthday is in 11 days (june 10th) yay

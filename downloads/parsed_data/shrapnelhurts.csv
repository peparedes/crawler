"event","Alllllllllllright, so I've gotten my parents moved into their new area and all that jazz and I think it's better for them here. Unfortunately I'm not going to say where because only the people that matter will know where la familia resides. I've realized that there are a key number of people you call your friends in life and that number stays quite low. Of course there are those people you hang out with every 6 months and who you talk to occasionally on the phone, but does that constitute a friendship? I don't call that friendship, I call it a fucking joke. 
        So, I'm cutting the useless shit out. My phone list has gone from 140 numbers to 20, No more drunk dialing, more focus on school, and being more open to new experiences. I'm severing Glynn County from my life and welcoming Bulloch County with open arms."

"event","This will be my last entry on this journal. I feel as if I've outgrown it and it's time to focus on life and the things I have to do to succeed. I have always been focused on what other people thought about me instead of knowing what I think about myself. I feel that I need to focus on myself  for once in my life and administer changes that need to be made. No longer will I sit and adapt for others because if I change it will BE ON MY OWN ACCORD. It's time to grow the fuck up and I'm going to kick some major ass (not literally).

I'll still get on and read people's journals that I give a shit about, there just won't be any new entries.


It's time to plow through some mother fuckers."

"event","The furthest objects that we could possibly are 13.6 billion light years away. That isnt because we cant see any further, its that light emitted from more distant objects has not had time to reach us yet. And how do we know that? Hubble's constant of course! If we assume that the speed of light is a constant, by observing various redshifts we can calculate the age of the universe at 13.6 billion years old; which is the standard most people go by today.


Now lets assume that you are all creationists. 13600000000 >> 6000 and that pisses you off, so you have to poke holes in the above theory somehow. Arguing that the distances we measure are not accurate is a good way make people think youre an idiot (lol its not 3.4665x10^24 is 4380, my bad guys!). So whats left to attack? Well, I guess the speed of light must not be constant througout time.


The trouble with this (for me at least) is that its probably true. There is evidence that suggests that the speed of light has been exponentially decreassing since the beggining of the universe. Exponentially is a misleading term though, because the actual difference between the speed of light then and now isnt all that great. However, misleading is what you specialize in, and youll be damned (lol pun) if youre gonna miss out on this one.


That brings me to what I want to talk about. Lets assume that the world is as the creationists would have us believe and see how royaly fucked things would be.

(as an aside there is a lot of math I have left out. I am goning to be throwing numbers around but dont think Im pulling them out of my ass)


We assume the age of the universe is 6000 years. Therefore light would have to traverse a 13.6 billion light year gap in 6000 years. We have that today the speed of light is 3.0x10^8 m/s and we assume that the original speed has been deteriorating exponentialy (ie. c(t)= Coe^-t). We cannot solve this exactly due to having to make the assumption that the speed of light has not varied noticibly since maxwell first determined it roughly 150 years ago. However, we can put a good lower bound at 3.404 X10^14 m/s.


Freekin 3.404x10^14 m/s! Thats a little over a million times faster than the speed of light we see today.


So?


First, We all remember than E=mc^2. So that difference of a million up there, it just got squared. All atomic reactions make use of this idea of matter transfering into energy. And we happen to be quite close to a very large souce of atomic reactions.

The Sun

Not really the sun, any star will do. Since there happen to be about 100 billion in our galaxy you can have your pick. All these stars generate power by the same means, Hydrogen fusion (until they run out, but we dont need to consider that). Every time 4 H nuclei combine to form one He nucleus 4.3x10-12 joules of energy are released. If the speed of light were as the fundies claim this would turn into a whopping 11 joules. thats means 2500000000000 times more energy would be released per atom of helium created.


That has dire implecations to a stars life. You see, they are in a constant state of blowing up and imploding at the same time, but in a stable star both forces are equal. Well, the creationists say, We need bigger stars so the force of gravity can keep up with the force blowing the stars up. Hell this could even explain Polulation III stars! The problem with that is that larger stars use their fuel faster, and no ammount of added material will even the forces out.

What That means is that no stars will be able to form. Which doesent look like the universe we see at all.


But lets just assume they could.

Stars give off light. They give off light because they are hot (the hotterr the star the higher frequency the light). With the speed of light increased a million times they would be REALLY hot. so the frequency of light they emit would be REALLY high.

If youve ever got a sunburn or cancer I dont have to tell you what high energy photons can do. But the sun is a pussy compared to what these radiative beasts would be. In fact the whole galaxy would be bathed in gamma ray radiation (you know, the stuff that comes out of nuclear bombs) making life across the universe impossible.


In conclusion I would like to say that I typed way more than I was planning on. Also, because of the above, the speed of light could never have been as high as it would have had to be 6000 years ago for the creationist viewpoint to be viable. Stellar radiation would fry any life upon contact not to mention that stars could not form in the first place. Therefore, anytime someone brings up this argument you may refer these ideas to them and not have to dismiss their comments offhand.

This is all culminating from being very bored and arguing for 2 hours about the same subject."

"event","Ok, so today I was riding the bus to the chemistry building and I was listening to some Matisyahu on my mp3 player when all of a sudden I saw something. This girl got on that had the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen in my entire life. Seriously, they were the type of eyes you get one glance with and and you question how something of such exquisite beauty is riding on this metal behemoth of a bus. Unfortunately I had to get off at the next stop but those eyes kept running through my head for the rest of the day. It was just one of those things that makes you ponder how a thing of such a heavenly stature could be riding a bus.

Man oh man, Vodka is pretty awesome if I must say so!!!



And i'm single again and back to square one. But I think I tend to date just because I'm bored and I have nothing else to do except jump into these meaningless relationships with shallow girls that have no depth.

Here is my ideal woman if I could build one:
Headstrong and knows what she wants
Intelligent 
compassionate and kind to others around
An awesome sense of humor and wierdness (come on who wants to date a normal person???)
Somebody that suprises me everyday as to how awesome they are
She also has to have a passion for something in life
She has to love her family
and I could go on!

One day, one day. But i'm not spending my time looking for a signifigant other. I'm just going to enjoy my life one day at a time because each day only comes once!!"

"event","Well, I can say it's been a while since I have written anything of any importance in this journal. Or have I ever written anything important or worthy of that title at all? As I reminise back upon entries I wrote when I was younger, I feel that most of these entries were my teen angst bursting out and I wanted some pity for my ""horrible life."" But now I feel that I should write things not as a child, but as a grown man who has come to terms with who he is. At the time in my life this journal was created, I did not know where my life was going because it felt like I going into a train tunnel and you don't know when you will see sunlight again.
        
         I finally see what was reason was for this and it was because I was afraid. I always focused too much on what other people think of me and not what I thought of myself. I was afraid to face the real Patrick Sartin who would tell me what I needed to hear, ""You are your mother and father's son and there is nothing you can do to change that, accept it."" It's funny how 4 months can change the way you look at the world so drastically. Little things help you see the real you, like a beautiful coastal sunrise where the sunlight dances off the water like Apollo is sending his muses to entertain you for the day. It hits you like a thousand boulders, I am me and I feel contempt with me for the first time in my life. 

I am my fathers son.
I am my mothers son.

I'll attempt to update frenquently with some inspirational things that I encounter during my journey.

Also, college is going okay but I admit I have been slacking off which WILL NOT happen next semester, I promise you. I also need to tell the people who I care about that I love them more often (in a sober state of course).

This journal will now be used to catalog all my thoughts, aspirations, and appreciations."

"event","I may be able to figure this out later, but I think I have to switch BTOC from weekly to biweekly or monthly. Since I'm starting back up at Atlus this week and I'm very much involved with Nguyen (it's a pretty awesome internship), I simply don't have the time to do this PLUS EcoCoalition PLUS BTOC. Since I don't want to flake out of something I already committed to, I have to stick with EcoCoalition. Check out the Air Quality section on ecocoalition.org if you want to see what I'm doing. It's like being a columnist, except I focus on air quality issues and my entries only have to be 300 words.&nbsp;

If I can keep BTOC up and running, I'm giving it its own Blogspot page. I'll post the entries on here as well, but I want to keep this as personal as possible. I'd ideally like to keep my professional and personal lives separate.&nbsp;

Granted, if I get the Atlantic or Salon internships, things may change...

"event","The Board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted unanimously today to endorse Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's proposal to build 12 Measure R mass transit projects in ten years, instead of the original 30. The proposal was even amended to include other transportation projects benefiting the county. Among these projects are an extension of the Metro Orange Line past Canoga, and a much-needed extension IMO of the subway from Downtown to the Westside.<br /><br />If you're wondering why it took so long for a Westside rail line, well... you're only half right.&nbsp;<br /><br />While browsing through blogdowntown.com, I discovered yesterday was the 66th anniversary of the &quot;Four Level&quot; interchange&rsquo;s unveiling in downtown Los Angeles. The four-level, for my non-Angeleno readers, is the notorious traffic pit where Highway 101 and the 110 Freeway meet.&nbsp;<br /><br />But that same year -- 1944 -- ridership hit an all-time high on the old Pacific Electric Railway. The Pacific Electric whatsit? Yes, there was a time when all of the Southland, reaching as far as Santa Ana, was connected by lines of electric streetcar tracks. Just like in San Francisco. In fact, beginning a hundred years ago, the &quot;<a href=""http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/la/historic/redcars/balloon_line.jpeg"">Balloon Route</a>&quot; on the PER ran from Downtown through Hollywood, Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Redondo Beach and back to L.A. via Culver City.<br /><br />You heard right: An electric streetcar line once connected Hollywood, Downtown and the Westside, in one fell swoop. <br /><br />Here's a broader map from around 1910, courtesy of the University of Southern California archives:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/la/historic/redcars/redcar_map.jpeg"" /><br /><br />See? Light rail is nothing new. On a side note, I like how under this old infrastructure, I could have ridden a streetcar from my old apartment in mid-Wilshire to my Disney job in Glendale, nine miles away. <br /><br />So what happened? Ironically, electric streetcars were already old news by 1944. As early as the 1920s, certain routes were phasing out to make room for buslines and paved roads. Trains had to yield high speed right of ways to traffic crossings. In the LA before freeways, mass transit was -- irony of ironies -- an increasing inconvenience, a pothole in the road of progress. After all, why bother with rail schedules when you have the personal freedom of an automobile? Indeed, gas was cheap, the LA Basin is flat... and if you think about it,  cars were just beginning to be marketed the <a href=""http://www.wcroberts.org/Paige_History/Images/1923-06-23%20Jordan%20Playboy.jpg"">right way</a>. Another side note: Why aren't car ads that poetic anymore?&nbsp;<br /><br />And so, proposals for a subway and elevated rail system were defeated, and priorities shifted to car travel. You probably don&rsquo;t go through the day thinking about highway designs, but just to put things in perspective, the four-level was absolute state of the art engineering. Unlike earlier cloverleaf designs, it avoided conflict between entering and exiting traffic by providing distinct ramps between all travel options. My old friend, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> loved it, of course. When construction began in 1947, a rendering of the interchange made the front page. The paper described the interchange as, &quot;One of the most intricate projects in the history of roadbuilding (1947),&quot; and &quot;&hellip;the fanciest whip-de-do of bridges, curving ramps and sweeping underpasses that you ever saw (18 July, 1949).&quot; <br /><br />The interchange finally opened for traffic in 1953. Eight years later, a lack of public funding closed the railways for good.&nbsp;<br /><br />And now, on the week of the interchange's anniversary, Villaraigosa is overheard discussing with a visiting President Obama about federal funding to hasten the development of&hellip;  a rail line connecting Downtown to the westside. The 101/110 interchange is among the most congested in the United States. In fact, of the ten worst highway bottlenecks nationally, four belong to Los Angeles. Naturally, the four-level structure is now named after Bill Keene -- a traffic reporter.&nbsp;<br /><br />Irony aside, however, I'm happy the 30/10 initiative garnered more support today. What I want to know is, would ridership still have peaked in 1944 without wartime gasoline rationing?&nbsp;<br /><br />Happy Earth Day!"

"event","...But I'll be running late this week. It's coming, though.

A lot happened over the weekend, adding onto the burden I mentioned in the last entry. So I decided to go to the California Democratic Convention last Saturday, so I could meet up with Melissa Fox at her breakfast. While I think Fox is a great candidate, I wound up getting involved with something even grander than before.

Two guys I met at the OCYD meeting found me, and I discovered one of them is a veteran who worked as a gofer for Dick Durbin, Ted Kennedy and even Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign, among others. After explaining to him what I was interested in doing, he directed me to a woman named Misha who's the campaign manager for Phu Nguyen. Phu is running for the 68th Assembly District, which encompasses all of Costa Mesa and Fountain Valley, and parts of Garden Grove, Westminster and Newport Beach. It's the district right next to mine (#70, which Melissa Fox is running for). Anyway, she invited me to become an intern for her, and help her run the campaign. Yikes!&nbsp;

I met up with her at the campaign office today to discuss the opportunity further. It definitely sounds like fun, but -- and this is a big but -- the question remains how I can devote 10 hours a week to this plus make a living. I might be able to juggle this with Atlus, but it won't be easy. On the plus side, this is a very well-run campaign and the odds are pretty good that Phu will win. Better yet: Misha said if he won and I did a good job, I would be put on the short list for staff positions. Double yikes!

Point being, I've been trying to figure this out for the past couple of days, and that's why my column is behind schedule.&nbsp;"

"event","Ok, just keep in mind I haven't done this in a year and a half. Give me time, it'll get better.<br /><br />I was <a href=""http://www.dailynexus.com/article.php?a=12579"">never</a> a big fan of <a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Irvine,+CA&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=49.444078,113.730469&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Irvine,+Orange,+California&amp;t=h&amp;z=12"">Irvine</a>. I only moved here because the job I wanted was in Irvine. Funnily enough, after living here for six months, I think I&rsquo;ve been approaching the city from the wrong angle. <br /><br />Let&rsquo;s say you woke up tomorrow morning and discovered your car was replaced with a bright red, mint condition, 1967 <a href=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3023/2597506389_b4a0d136a1.jpg"">Alfa Romeo Spider Duetto</a>. No strings attached. Tempting, but then the right side of your brain kicks in. This car is noisy, uncomfortable, lacks room for more than two people and lacks space for more than two bags. You&rsquo;d get to drive it maybe once a month, and spend the rest of your time figuring out the new reason why it won&rsquo;t start. <br /><br />But my God, those curves, the open top, that throaty exhaust&hellip; <em>marrone</em>! The Duetto is a sexy little minx, ain&rsquo;t it? The car possesses that mystical variable all automakers covet: character. As any classic sports car enthusiast knows, the repairs and the impracticalities of their rides are part of what constitutes &ldquo;character.&rdquo; Maintaining the car is what intimately bonds driver and machine. It helps Nigel Shiftright better appreciate the car&rsquo;s more alluring assets.  <br /><br />Going back to the Southland, I lived in the Larchmont (mid-Wilshire) district of Los Angeles for most of last year. In concept, Larchmont Village offers just about everything I ever wanted from a home at that time. I was a few miles from any part of the city, including the Westside, Hollywood or the hip bohemianism of Los Feliz and Silverlake. The Larchmont farmer&rsquo;s market was even walking distance from my apartment. <br /><br />But soon reality weighed down on me like the blanket of smog ever-lingering over Downtown. Yes, everything is a few miles away, but getting there means sitting in incessant freeway traffic or battling through endless stoplights on crowded, cramped city streets. What about light rail? Well, Metro works great&hellip; as long as your destination is anywhere but where Metro&rsquo;s arguably needed most: Downtown-Westside and especially Valley-Westside. The weather is almost as hot in the summer as the Valley, and the air quality is even worse. A tony English manor in Windsor Square may lie a block away from a slum on the outskirts of Koreatown.   <br /><br />Such quirks are part of living in a big city like Los Angeles. Urban commandos argue that it&rsquo;s up to us to improve the neighborhoods and make them better places to live. This is how gentrification projects get started in eastside neighborhoods like Silverlake, Echo Park and Eagle Rock. Even Culver City on the Westside used to be rundown. Ah, but Los Angeles, you see, exudes &ldquo;character&rdquo; in a way none of the cities in south Orange County could understand. It has spirit, verve, charisma &mdash; whatever you want to call it. It&rsquo;s a fixer-upper of a town with mountains, beaches, nightlife, daylife and everything in between. <br /><br />Wait, so LA is fun because it&rsquo;s high maintenance? Well, I think humans of a certain age and lifestyle are drawn to the risk and character of urban life, just as one feels drawn towards an Italian sports car. We like fixing up Echo Park because the neighborhood feels &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; and &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; &mdash; but not quite Pico-Union dangerous, naturally. Just dangerous enough so residents can make fun of people from the Valley or OC for being &ldquo;soft.&rdquo;<br /><br />This is one of the reasons Irvine is anathema to the average LA hipster. The way I see it, though, Irvine is boring the way a Camry is boring. Everything works the way it&rsquo;s supposed to work, right out of the box. Low crime, lots of parking, good air quality, great schools, easy access to freeways and the beach&hellip; are these really such bad things? Am I soft? I don&rsquo;t see why. At this point in my life, I&rsquo;d rather live in a city that works. I appreciate how much the Irvine Company cares about creating a livable environment. <br /><br />Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love LA&rsquo;s finer qualities. I have nothing but respect for urban activists. If I want to experience some character, though, then LA will be waiting for me on the weekend. <br /><br />Besides: Don&rsquo;t people normally purchase Alfa-Romeos as second cars?"

"event","Wow, I really need to update this more. Now I have to catch you up on what happened at the Game Developers Conference last week.

No Double Fine or Bioware at the Career Pavilion this year -- BUT... there was a company I admire maybe only 5% less than Double Fine: Telltale Games.

I like to think of Telltale as what LucasArts was like 15 or 20 years ago -- a lot of old-school adventure games with some great jokes. Which figures, since most of the staff used to work there. The Lead Designer, for example, is Dave Grossman, who co-designed Day of the Tentacle.

Anyway... I saw Telltale was hiring interns AND testers, so I knew I had to make my move. I made a couple of jokes with the people at the booth, and finagled my way into a promise of facetime with Grossman the following day. Okay, that's a start.

I return the next day. Dave is eating lunch at the back of the booth. It's kinda surreal to see one of your gaming heroes eating lunch... but I digress. I come back fifteen minutes later. The people at the booth recognize me from yesterday, and there I am, talking to Dave Grossman. Nice. I tell him I've been a fan since DoTT.

""Wow! How old you were back then?""

Seven, for the record. I didn't discover these games until a little bit after Grim Fandango was released.

I tell him I'm a writer, I can do this and that, and what should I do if I want a chance with you guys. He says to send him some writing samples. Alright, sure. I give him a business card for good measure.

&nbsp;So that was last Thursday. I started compiling together things to send him on Saturday, but it took me until this afternoon to send him the e-mail because I kept checking to see whether any of Project Mean One was worthy of sending (it wasn't). I ended up giving him three Nexus columns, the module I made for Bioware last year, my resume and much worry on my part he wouldn't be able to open the module.

For that matter, will he respond? That agent Kate referred me to never did.

Not only did he respond, but it was only an hour after I sent the e-mail. Not only that, his first sentence is that my business card is sitting on his desk.

BUT...

--Can't open the module (I knew it!)

--Says my columns ""aren't bad"" 

--Says Telltale's not hiring for writing/design interns. 

I remember him saying that last part at the show, but he said to send him stuff anyway. 

But then he said I had ""interesting stuff"" on my resume, which he then delivered by hand to the guy looking at the QA resumes.

Your guess is as good as mine what happens from here.

My ""let's be realistic"" guess is I can maybe score a phone interview. It had better not be in person because, by the way, Telltale is based in San Rafael. That's 385 miles away...

The comic is ambitious -- I'll post links later. I feel good about where it can go. I wonder sometimes how much personal experience one can ultimately put into a comic about a 40 year-old man reincarnated as a 16 year-old girl, but somehow it doesn't seem like that big of a challenge. 

Currently poring over the character guide and outline given to me and planning out the next sequence."

I would normally complain about how this takes away from my EC on LBP time, but I've been really bad about updating it for the past two weeks. I blame this on two things:</p><p>1. Playing through Chrono Trigger and Dragon Quest IV on the DS</p><p>2. Disney has a truly astonishing library of books, DVDs, BVDs and games. The games date back to 1994. Did I mention all of this can be checked out for free, for days and days on end?

"event","Celeste at work insisted I see this movie, so she gave me her DVD copy this morning and I watched it just now. 

It confirms my initial suspicions from when the movie was first released -- namely the similarities to my Dead Flowers script from back in 2003. Rian Johnson understood what I wanted far better than I did, admittedly. 

I should point out Dead Flowers was not set in a high school. The script was merely an attempt to revive film noir. Johnson's good idea was to place his story in an Orange County high school, removing the spectator from their preset expectations on how noir should look. 

The movie's not perfect, of course. But it stays with me, an hour after I watched it. I admire Johnson's dedication to his idea and following it all the way through.

...Even though it took seven years, according to the DVD commentary.

"event","In honor of today, here is my very first LJ entry -- dated December 16, 2003:

-

Hey, I meant to start one of these things a long time ago, but there was a time when LJ made you effin' pay for space, and that's not cool. I'm probably going to use this as a place to store ideas I get for whatever writing project I'm working on. Otherwise I'd never update this thing on a regular basis.

For anyone reading this that has Mr. DuPriest for English: have you started your extended journal entry yet? I feel like I should get going on that but I can't summon up the energy. I also need to write something fun for Chip...for reasons I can't disclose to you yet. Maybe later?

You know, for all the slack that Richard Simms gets for ""No More MTV,"" I think he's actually created the most memorable and long-lasting Embryo song of all time. It's an awfully catchy bastard.

I saw Y Tu Mana Tambien for the first time this afternoon. I thought it was going to be like a soft-core porno, but as it turns out there are only about three sex scenes and neither are any more graphic than what I've seen on Six Feet Under. In fact, Six Feet Under is MORE graphic. I guess the movie was Unrated because everyone has this big taboo about masturbation on-screen. The language is pretty bad too, but when was the last time a movie was rated NC-17 for language?

While I'm on the subject of movies, I saw the premiere of Mona Lisa Smile last night and the movie sucks balls. Regardless, Maggie Gyllenhaal is offically my new celebrity crush. I'm going to try and hunt out Secretary this weekend at Blockbuster.

--

Being a 17 year-old high school senior at Westminster seems like such a long time ago. And yet, I'm stunned five years have passed since then.

When I started my spam__robot account, most of the fun was because a lot of kids at Westminster had an LJ already. It was a fun way to keep in outside contact with some inside jokes. 

I don't think any of those guys are still on Livejournal. Except for Noah, who showed me LJ to begin with a year before I started.

Will I continue for five more years? Can't say for certain, but I'll sure try."

I'm curious to see what happens. Especially since there's an 80-90% chance I'm being put on a ""forced vacation"" tomorrow for a couple of weeks at DIS. Talk about a company not being prepared for an economic slowdown... 

Time to move on. 

On the other hand, if I am on ""forced vacation"" for two weeks, it gives me ample time to plug away at Energy Crisis. 

I noticed Dr. Phil still wants a transcriber over at Paramount. Now that I can walk there in five minutes, you can bet I applied again.

"event","So I stumbled upon a map of Los Angeles from 1943 earlier tonight. A lot of the houses in my neighborhood-to-be are from the 1920s, so I decided to look for my address.

And sure enough, there was the intersection -- Melrose and Van Ness. But so was something else: Polar Ice Palace. Located smack on that intersection. 

Polar Ice Palace? Wha? 

Google to the rescue: http://www.squareone.org/PolarPalace/index.html

So there you have it: My neighborhood used to be an ice skating rink. 

Also interesting about the map is how LA looks without the freeways. At Pico and Normandie, for instance, there's a cemetery located in the direct pathway of the 10. 

So where did they move the bodies, you think?

"event","Let me preface this post by saying that I didn't intend to move out of Tarzana any earlier than December. I even wanted to wait until January. 

But then Soo text messages me Sunday morning and says there's a studio apartment available in her complex for $650 a month.

Preposterous, I thought. -- she had to have meant $950. Even Van Nuys barely has studios for $950. 

No, she says, it's $650. Her mom is friends with the landlord. 

Now Soo does not live in the Valley. She actually lives down in Mid-Wilshire, near Larchmont Village. The nearest cross street is Melrose and Clifton. 

A Google Maps search revealed that her place is only 9 miles from work, so I bit and told her I was interested.

Since then, I've driven down to check out the apartment and neighborhood, and discovered to my surprise that Larchmont is really handy. It's walking distance from Hollywood Forever Cemetery (where Cinespia is held in the summer), and also from freaking Paramount Studios -- where I would work if I got the transcriber job with Dr. Phil that I applied to on a lark last week. 

Pink's? 2 miles.

The Grove? 2.7 miles.

Fox? 7.5 miles.

Activision/Square Enix? Well, an hour with traffic. That's better than the 90 minutes it takes currently. The month-to-month lease would allow me to look for a place in the South Bay if the need should arise. 

The drive to Alex's is now 42 miles, which is the primary downside. Better than the 60-odd miles it took from Goleta, but still a pain. 

But still, this bears repeating:

My VERY OWN studio apartment -- not a rented room -- in Larchmont Village, for $650 a month. This is not a big deal in Atlanta dollars, but friggin' amazing here. 

Anyway, Soo said the place is mine by virtue of us being friends, so I don't have to worry about competition. After much research and inspection, I decided to go for it. Move-in will be November 16.

What can I say? I'm a perfectionist. I want this game to be fantastic from beginning to end. 

I'm fairly certain I'll be laid off this week. It's just as well, because I found out what Warren Spector's up to, and it's a long ways away. That's about all I can say before I break confidentiality agreements. 

However, this might only be a two-week layoff, which gives me a great window to pump out more of Energy Crisis. 

Oh, and I applied to Square Enix last week, even though a former employee told me they treat their workers like crap. I just want Square Enix on my resume :)

I then decided I didn't like the music I composed, so I created a new, entirely different track on Logic. 

The game still needs inventory items and dialogue, though...

But I realized earlier this week that I can't do ANYTHING unless I finish this game. It's priority number one.

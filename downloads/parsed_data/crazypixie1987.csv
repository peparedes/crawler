Holland knew there was the potential for Lidstrom to miss a game after the break, but didn't pressure his star defenseman to play. <p>&quot;Nik Lidstrom has been an incredible ambassador for our team and for our game. I respect his decision,&quot; Holland told ESPN.com on Friday.</p><p>Holland was less enthusiastic about the policy that will sit his star defenseman for a game. &quot;I disagree with the decision, but I'm not running the league,&quot; he said.</p><p>Tuesday's game is looming as a difficult outing for the Central Division-leading Wings, as Holland said they might be without defenseman <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?playerId=898""><font color=""#225fb2"">Brad Stuart</font></a> and forward <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?playerId=3099""><font color=""#225fb2"">Johan Franzen</font></a> as well.</p><p>NHL commissioner Gary Bettman imposed the policy, established at last year's general managers meetings, to legitimize injury claims and improve All-Star Weekend attendance. The policy states All-Stars who are injured must have missed at least the last game before the All-Star break in order to be excused; otherwise, they must sit out the first regular-season game after the break.</p><p>&nbsp;Former NHL goalie Glenn Healy, now director of player affairs for the NHLPA, disagrees with the league's stance on the issue. He said the league needs to look at the big picture.</p><p>&nbsp;&quot;It's not good for hockey and it's not good for the fans,&quot; if Lidstrom and Datsyuk are held out of play, Healy said.</p><p>&nbsp;Players invited to the YoungStars competition are still exempt from the policy, and several have bowed out of the event, including Columbus goalie <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?playerId=3657""><font color=""#225fb2"">Steve Mason</font></a> and Washington center <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/players/profile?playerId=3666""><font color=""#225fb2"">Nicklas Backstrom</font></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;Campbell said the attendance policy eventually may be extended to cover the YoungStars as well.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/allstar2009/news/story?id=3855534"">http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/allstar2009/news/story?id=3855534</a><br /><a href=""http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jVIzaYbBIxUkKro5gCLZlnJgVsew"">http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jVIzaYbBIxUkKro5gCLZlnJgVsew</a><br />&nbsp;</p>"

"event","Sometimes i feel like i need 
To shake myself 
To wake myself
I feel like im just sleepwalkin'
Through my life
Its like im swimming through
An ocean of emotion
But still somehow slowly
Goin numb inside
I dont like who im becomin'
I know i've gotta do somethin'
Before my life passes right by

I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like sun on a beautiful mornin'
Sing to the heavens like the church bells ringin'
Fight to the devil and go down swingin'
Fly like a bird,roll like a stone
Love like i aint afraid to be alone
Take everything that this world has to give 
I want to live

Sometimes i wonder
Why i work so hard to guard my heart
Till i hardly feel anything at all 
I've spent my whole life building up this ivory tower
And now that im in it, i keep wishing it would fall
So i could feel the ground beneath me
Really taste the air im breathin'
And know that im alive


I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like sun on a beautiful mornin'
Sing to the heavens like the church bells ringin'
Fight to the devil and go down swingin'
Fly like a bird,roll like a stone
Love like i aint afraid to be alone
Take everything that this world has to give 
I want to live


Somethin deep inside
Keeps sayin
Life is like a vapor
Its gone in just a blink of an eye

I want to cry like the rain
Cry like the rain
Shine like sun on a beautiful mornin'
Sing to the heavens like the church bells ringin'
Fight to the devil and go down swingin'
Fly like a bird,roll like a stone
Love like i aint afraid to be alone
Take everything that this world has to give 
I want to live


I want to take every
Breath i can get 
I want to live
Yeah, yeah"

"event","Hey!


It's amazing two update within a week. lol.


So Saturday I worked 5-10 and then went to Kelly's Black and White Party.

It was sooo much fun. I learned how to play beer pong and tippy cup. Stephanie and Kelly's friends are soo nice. Justin was cracking me up all night long. Then, after I lost my dear Puff, me and Mary began to hang out. Then Zach renamed us. Zach was Stevie Wonder. Mary was Elvis Presly. I was originally named Boy George then changed to Jimi Hendrix. I met this really nice guy named Mike. It was just such a blast. Good times.


I'm kinda sick now.


Later-
Jenn"

"event","Ok! I have done...nothing since I last wrote...well some crap I guess. 

Saturday I slept 'till 9 then went to work (disgust). I got off work then I did...sleep.

Sunday I slept till 8 then went to work (earlier...more disgust). I got off then went home. I watched movies. Slept.

Monday I skipped going to school. I drew crap. I went to sleep. 

Ok now that I'm current...

Today has been boring. I drew some stuff. Then I went and walked around. I saw Sam and Tommy. Tommy left. Sam appeared again. Sam said I'm nosey. I didn't do nothing to him. Sam backwards is Mas. I don't know what that means but who cares. ...nothing is boring!"

"event","Well today I drew in the 4th floor library. Me, Dez, and Sam. Sam actually did some good stuff today. I liked his beast he drew if only he would listen to the Gastons when they give crits. They are very helpful. Well Sam went to Port 1 review and then me and the G's tried to follow. Ms. Mckissic wouldn't let us in so we bounced. We went to MJ Designs to get their checks. They cashed them and treated me to Whataburger...food...thought I wouldn't see you again... OK! Well we then went to the GameStop and they got some games...I want to play them but I won't be able to chill for awhile. I have to much crapo to accomplish. Anderson got some free device when he bought his game. It was some little thing similiar to a hearing aid. It had headphones that connected to a small green box. It amplifies sound so he can hear people talking low about 3-6 feet away. I tried it but I'm expesily loud (as Sam puts it) so when I used it I laughed at how cool it was. This caused my ears to feel like they were going to bleed...I hate having a megaphone for a voice...
They went to work then I drew up a character.

"event","Well Wednesday I came to the decision that I wasn't going to make it in Computer Animation. The thought came to me after 3 quarters of knowing it. Switching to Graphic Design was one of the worst days of my life. The feeling of unworth seeped from through my whole body. I could barely speak to the administrators...but I just could not grasp 3DSMAX for nothing. After failing/retaking the first class I noticed I wasn't too good at this program. I logged all these hours and I still didn't seem to get much more than ctrl z...sad huh? Every passing day I noticed others leaving me in dust clouds as they advanced way further than I was. I have let down my two friends the Gastons...Dez exspecially. I have spent ALOT of money at this school and MUST graduate with some kind of degree. My current plans are to continue on with my 2D practice. Graphic Design shouldn't be that hard after the hell CAM students face. Taking from Master Yem Yam the dark lord I will return to college after some time in the field. My next major I'll be gunning for is 2D animation at Cal Arts. I heard nothing but good things about this school. Besides Jhonen Vasquez and COACH himself both attended that school."

"event","...today is already threatening to be a giant walking headache. I awoke late so I missed out on break fast and cough E. This is unfortunate because it's only 8 am...another 13 hours here at school. I hope to accomplish something today other than nothing. :D We'll see about that. If sam, I mean shizza would make a phony site I would post some art. I just don't have the time to do it myself. I have assignments due for coach so I gotta get on the ball. 

...Sam has so many people...heh"

"event","Well I'm hooked on this LJ sheet! I just recieved 2 disses for the price of one.
KK (a obnotous artist with an ego the size of the sun)decided I was a ""faggot"" for some reason or another.(steadly talking sheet) *I would like to state here that I love spanish womens, and have never looked at a guy in such a manner* I attempted to make a witty comeback and tell him I would beat him up. Then he remarked the only thing I would be beating was ""meat"". >:( 

I will probably think of a sutable comeback @2 in the mourning...SAMMIT!
Sam didn't attempt to lend his wittyness he just laughed at me...he is now on the LIST.
Watch your back KK, and you too Shizza! 

I have a headache that is causing me to lose focus...I forgot what I was gonna post before the double slap to my manhood. Probably something of no relavance. I am currently wasting time and avoiding the class that threatens to ruin my GPA."

"event","Today I have 3D animation. I suck at 3D animation. I hope to do conceptual (make up everything) type artist. This is going to require I sleep less, drink more coffee(is that possible?), and sell my soul to Sam...well not that part. 

It's lunch and the growling of my stomach tells me to eat. My wallet on the ohter hand is telling me that I have to wait till Wednesday...SHEET!!! I almost feel like reverting to kindergarden and eat some paper. The fact that I KNOW it taste bad is stopping me. :D 

I'm extremely tired today because I couldn't sleep. I got off work @ 12 pm. I layed down to sleep @ 1 and for 3 hours to come I rolled, tossed, and turned in the constant thought that I couldn't sleep. The red light daunted me with it's evilness. 2:30, 3:30...around 4 I think I fell asleep. 5 oclock and it's up an atem time. I stagger with a zombie sway to the kitchen tripping over 2 dogs and a pillow on my way to the machine that would produce life-giving CAFFIENE! After a pot of coffee I started my day. Got to school, laughed at Sam (not to be confused as laughing ""with"") and he gave me a code. Now I can burn my experiences here on this journal...funny I was always to lazy to write one..."

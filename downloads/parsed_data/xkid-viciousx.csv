"event","I could not get ONE chance to go back to sleep this morning. God fucking dammit. If it wasnt one thing, it was another thing with the child. He got mad because the DVD player fucked up his SPIDERMAN movie... of which I have grown to hate after having to watch it every morning for about 4 months. Why cant he watch The Nightmare Before Christmas?! I'd never get burnt out on that movie. I feel like strangling that child with a fucking bondage strap off of my pants or something. Gah. THEN!!! He was going through the kitchen, getting popsicles and shit... and he JUST ate breakfast. Of course, because I had fallen back asleep... I had no awareness of this until he had half of the popsicle gone. I'm gonna fucking...GRRRR!!!!! AND thennnnnnnnn..... the fucking PHONE wouldnt stop ringing... and that leads us to where I am now. Still with a headache. Still tired. I am growing to dislike babysitting a whole lot. Or as Joel said it in a simple word... Ewwwwicky. :\


So help me god if I kill this child today....

<b>
I've learned to forget
I've learned to forgive
I've learned how to put up 
With the past I have lived
I've learned that this past
And horrible memories of mine
Are almost just figments
That will heal with time.
I've learned to love again
To let myself have a life
And this time I wont mistreat it
I'm going to live it right
Theres no time for mistakes
I'll learn from my past
Because now I realized I'm something
My happiness is nolonger a mask
A mask which would shatter
When I was alone
Happiness is an emotion
I've learned to reown
I'd always wondered what it was like
To actually feel like this
And for once in my life
I feel I'm at total bliss.</b>

"event","Well... today was a fairly good day. It kinda fell down towards the end, but I'm okay now. I had to babysit again today like usually. My step brother was trying to get me in trouble and shit. He said I was trying to burn him, when he was the one playing with the lighter, and lighting stuff. He almost burnt a hole in the carpet. But there was an upside to all of that. You know that damn fucking fish, that I told you about.. well.. I BROKE THE MOTHERFUCKER!!! even ask <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~xbenj"">Benj</a>>. He heard me throw it against a few walls. Then Jessie hit his bed on my futon. I felt stupid, because I'm sure Benji probably thought I did it... =XX sorry i'm not that much of an asshole. Then my mom came over. Gave me the money for the CD, since it turned out that he never got it for me, and never planned on it. Friday I gotta pay my mom back though. My mom got mad at me because I told Benji she was bad. She's still pissed at me.. =X oops. But yeah... after my dad got home I went and got the CD. I really havent stopped listening to it. Everyone needs to go buy it cuz I said so. =] But anyways.. I was really fine. until it had set in that the phone call i got 3 days ago, about my uncle.. was true... It hit when i tried calling him to talk to him.. and i was like.. wow.. he's gone. But i'll be fine... i suppose. It's just really depressing =[. But luckily I had Benji. =D Thank yous much.

Laura - - I'm sorry i couldnt be much of a help today. I dont want to see you and Benj fighting anymore...


But yeah I'm fine now. Benji.. its amazing how the bracelet doesnt hurt me. I'm in awe o.o;...

Oh and by the way. I have another poem. I have to say that this one is definately one of my favorites.


<b>I'm tired of people always 
Seeming like I'm nothing
In someone's eyes
I wish i could be something
I wish i could make
Something out of this life
Just forget about my worries
All the pain and strife
Just put the needle down
And take it all away
God knows whats gonna happen
Or what the hell is making me stay
I could just over dose
And do just like Sid did
After all he was my idol
And I am now the Kid.
Maybe follow in his footsteps
And take it all away
But that is something I will worry about
Another dreary day.
</b>

But if it wasnt for you then I probably would have done it a long time ago before i met them. You've gone through more pain, from what I know, than i could ever bare to imagine. You know exactly what I go through.. and I just wanted to say, thank you for being there. And now I will post another poem of mine that I just wrote.

<b>Waiting one last time
To see you before I leave
Because you were one of the few
Who actually cared for me
Just one last time 
to see your face
Is all I want
Before I leave this place
Alone I sit
And wait for you
But then I realized..
You're gone too
I wonder what happened
What I did wrong
That made me not realize
That you had been gone for so long.
Reality stabbed me
Hard in the back
And now it hurts
And I dont quite get the nack
Of all this pain
Flooding me so fast
But all I could think about
Was our wonderful past
The days we spend
Just you and I
Looking up at the stars
At the moonlit sky
But now you're gone
And I'll be gone too...
Because I love you so much
And I need to be with you.

<b>If I were to die
On this cold, lonely night...
It'd be because noone noticed
That I wasn't alright.
Noone bothered to ask
If I was okay
So I decided to quit
Not go one more day.
But I know there is one of you
I hold dear to my heart
You were there to the end
And right from the start
You tried to save me
Did all in your will
But nothing could save me
I just had to be killed
So if you wonder where I am
On this cold lonely night
Just look up to the sky
And you'll see the answer is right
I am you're friend
Faithful and true...
And if i could give up anything...
I'd do it for you.
So remember this quickly
And remember it right
I took the bullet for you
On this cold lonely night.</b>

<b>I slice and cut
but its not enough
So i do it a few more times
To prove I'm tough.
But this time I fear
I've cut to much
And I'm lost and gone...
You're late and out of luck
For those who care
I'm sorry what I did
But now I'm gone
A farewell i bid.
I love you all much
And with deepest concern
That you shouldnt befrend me
And now you have learned.
For now I have left
And now you can see
That I wasn't too smart
For now I bleed.
Tears are shed
But I do know
That your memories of me
Soon will go
So just forget
As soon as you will
Do not capture these memories
For now I lay still
Dead and gone
Thats what I am
So just forget me
As soon as you can.</b>

<b>I have no friends
I have no life
All that I have
Is my trusty knife
I hold it at an angle
And I hope I do it right
And maybe if i'm lucky
Tonight will be the night
So I pray to god
He wont count this as a sin
I make a deep cut
I have only began
As I cut once more
A blackness unfolds
And all my pain
Remains untold.

I know this could seem awfully teenie of me, but, one way or another I must say. I know its stupid to get nervous about because I know girls are like this to you all the time. Sometimes, i really DO wish we were actually getting married. Sometimes, I wish I were older, just to have the chance to be with you, but hah. won't happen. I know you probably also have your same suspicion on girls, like Joel does, with how they would use you and all... but ask Joel about what I said earlier about those kind of girls. I'm kinda hoping when you read this, you wont completely freak out, or hate me or something. I really don't want you to think less of me either. I just really love you, and care for you and all.. =/ i just wish something more sometimes, even though I know its impossible for it to happen. I've liked you for about 4 years. Since i was about 9-ish. You have to remember, when I was 9, i thought like a 13 year old. And now here I am, 13, and thinking like an adult. Sometimes I just wish people would get that, but here I am trapped in a little 13 year old body... longing for an escape. I can't find anyone, thats treated me better than you and Joel have.. and and.. yeah... I'm going to shut up now.. because I'm starting to embarrass myself while im typing this... *goes off somewhere and dies*"

What can I say? You are one of the coolest people I've met. When we met...I knew you werent a regular ""fan"" that just wanted to talk to me so you could go to school and brag to your friends that you talked to me. You've been really nice to me, and I love chatting with you. You've also been there for me as well. Remember that time when I was ""emo"". I had the away msg consisting of ""I'm either outside breaking something or sitting with Benj"". Well, you were there for me. I'd also like to say, that i DO care for you, and i AM attached to 'yooh'. And yes, all this rambling on...it could never describe just how rad you are. You make the slow times on tour fun. Instead of sitting on the bus watching TV, I'm laughing my ass off at the conversations we have. And you dont get mad at me, like other people who IM me, when I'm busy being tackled by my ass of a brother. XD Through silly times and hard times we're there for each other. I want you to know that you ARE my friend and that I do care about you. Much love. Joel."

"event","Okay, well here it goes... I'm going to start making paragraphs for all my friends, and what I think about them. Don't worry if I don't get you now, I will get you later, I promise. this is going to be a multiple post thing...

first off...

<b>Meggyz</b>- Meggyz, you have become one of the greatest friends to me, and I'd do just about anything for you. You mean the world to me, and you always encourage me on my singing, and anything else thats going wrong, when I feel I have no willpower left to do it. You are my inspirational boost, among alot of other things. Meggz, I love you a whole bunches, and I feel not even words can describe how much your friendship means to me. It's so amazing how close people can get in a matter of a few months. I really wouldn't know what to do if I lost you. Together, you and I are the strongest people alive... maybe not to other people, but to ourselves, we know we can make it through ANYTHING together. You and I can goof around alot, and also be serious when times get rough. You've been there for me a whole hell of alot, and I hope I've been there for you, when you needed me. I am running out of things to say about you, for whatever I have said in this paragraph cannot compare to how you really are, and how your being inflicts upon my life. Meggyz, all in all, I just wanted to say, thank you for being there, and thank you for being my friend. I couldn't ask for anything better. You, Joel, Benji, Rani, and Sammy. That's all I really, really need in my life.

<b>Joel</b>- Joel... where to start. You are what makes me think about my life. Just to talk to you and Meggz, are probably one of the only reasons I get out of bed in the morning. Your friendship has had such an impact on my life, it's almost unbearable. You have been nothing but nice to me, and have also been there for me. Before I met Meggyz, you were what kept me alive. That one day, when you told me you were attatched to me, I started crying, because I had never had anyone really express that much care towards me before. It's quite awkward for me, to have people care like you and meggyz do. I'm glad you talk to me, and don't just look at me as a normal fan. I'm glad you can see a friend in me as well. Despite all my friends actions on tearing me away from you, it won't work, because I, myself, have become too attached to you as well. Writing these essays on people are hard, and I have to say, you and Meggyz are the hardest. As I said prior, in Meggyz, words would not express how i feel towards you, or what I think about you. I could say so many nice things about you, and none of them could compare. Compare to what you really are. I hope both you and meggz realize, that what I say in these posts, I completely mean about you two.. you two are the greatest. I just hope, that you two can say atleast half of what I said here. I would be happy if I could compare to half of what you are, Joely.



There's two down... I had to get the hardest two out of the way first... I'll post back later with a new paragraph or two... Right now, I'm gonna go talk to Effy#2

"event","New layout.... I guess it doesnt quite express how I feel though. I've been in a big emotional slump lately. I don't know why... =/ This knife isnt as near as sharp enough as i want it to be. My wrist stings... its irritated. Fun.... lucky these things are mere cat scratches. I don't think I'm ready to die yet. When I will be, I'll do it. but anyways... I just kinda realized how much of a social outcast I am. What I want to know is how people who are about 40 times uglier than me can have more boyfriends than me. This sucks... I just want to be loved... erg. People don't seem to understand my emotions hurt alot easier than they think. They also don't seem to understand my emotions are alot more mature than theirs probably are... agh. *sigh*... I might be getting into a fight tomorrow at school. Because I said Eminem sucks. How funny. =X but yes... I will be off now. No more of my worthless talk.

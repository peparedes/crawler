Things are sucking majorly in life right now.  Got laid off at work.  3 of us did.  Of course this is after we've busted our asses and put up with so much bullshit.  Oh well.  

And while I have great friends....at least most of them.  Some of them are just....aggravating.  Nothing beats going out of your way to support a friend only to realize they'd rather make sure they didn't hurt some strangers feelings over hurting a friends feelings.  Why do people fucking do that??  I mean...if I had to make the choice....I would much rather hurt some strangers feelings...some person I've only met once or twice over hurting a friend who has been there for me for years.  Am I asking to much by thinking that would be the logical choice???  I dunno.

My own stupidity for thinking someone could change...even just a little bit.

"event","I'm procrastinating.  Blah.  I've been cleaning off and on all day.  It's just the little shit left...but it's obnoxious little shit and I don't know what to do with it all.  Ugh.  

I was supposed to go to a cook out tonight but canceled.  I think I just want to stay in and read.  I feel bad cuz I knew if I told Sean that he'd argue with me until I gave in and went.  And that would involve picking him up from work, taking him to his old apartment near where I live...then taking him back to his new place and the grocery store.  So it'd honestly be like 2 trips to and from work....and I'm running way low on money and gas so I really can't afford to do that running.  I love Sean but it's getting old.  I mean I can't really argue...when we go out he pays for me and buys me drinks.  I'd rather that he just throw me some gas money though.  Cuz I can go out and not drink.  I'm spending more money driving him around than anything.  I need to learn how to say no more often.  

I'm begining to hate cleaning.  It seems like it's never done.  Blah."

"event","So I've decided that there are some things that just gotta change.  With me that is.  I've gained too much weight in the past 4 months or so due to drinking.  So it's time to cut back.  I mean...I used to go out like once a month and drink a few beers....now I'm getting drunk every weekend. So after this Friday I'm cutting back.  I'm going to limit myself to 2 beers when I'm out.  If that.  Yes I will still get drunk on occassion...but not everytime I'm out.  

I'm also going to refrain from going out so much.  I'm going to stay home...read...write...just veg out.  I've got the trip to WV with Sean this friday.  After that I have the Navel CD release party (That I don't want to go to...but I promised Wally and Laura I would).  Then there's the Bowling with Weirdos party at the end of the month.  That's a BME thing.  I haven't done a BME event in years.  So that should be a nice change of pace.  Then comes September.  On the 9th I have to go to PA with Deb to hang out while she gets tattooed.  It'll be like old times...except obviously Gary won't be there :(  That night I booked myself for 2 shows.  Frontbutt in Cville (which I really don't wanna go to but I told Terry I'd be there)....and ThatGuy in Fburg.  This is why I need a break.  I'm overbooking myself.  I'm not sure which show I'm going to yet.  Then the very next day I've got the Reverand Horton show in Cville with Sean and Ryan.  And that's it!!  I haven't booked myself beyond that.  I need a fucking break.  

Hopefully that'll save me some money too."

"event","It's been one of those days already.  Saturday was fun.  Tim and Tori's bday party seemed to go over well.  No drama ;)  At least not for me.  And Tori didn't puke.  Yeahh!!!  But I didn't get home from Cville until 7am on Sunday.  I slept for a few hours and managed to get to the grocery store and stay under budget for once.  Then I got to help Sean move some stuff.  Which was supposed to happen at 6pm.....got pushed back til 8am....cuz we were waiting on someone.  So I'm exhausted and just wanting to go to bed and I'm stuck waiting.  Not good considering the small amount of sleep I got.

And then today I get a text from Dawn saying she's going to be out at Dulles so she'll be in late today.  Great.  So I'm at work and I'm downstairs and I'm waiting and waiting and starving.  Finally at 11am I text her to see if she's actually coming in.  She's been upstairs for hours....nice of her to let me know.  Meanwhile I've been sitting downstairs with the shakes because I'm so hungry.  And heaven forbid I can't go to lunch because there's no one to answer the phone.  Grrrr.  

Yea that's how my day started.  4.5 more hours and then I can go home.

I might get pierced tomorrow.  Or sometime this week.  First I have to check and see if I'm anatomically suited for the piercing.  We'll see."

"event","Things are so weird right now.  Like...not weird bad...weird in a just a weird way.  WHen you realize how much is changing in life and all of that.  It's like a big blow.  Not really in a bad way though.

So I've been spending more time with Mike and that crew of people.  They are fun.  And because of Mike I've met Jessica.  I mean...take this past weekend.  Friday I went and saw Pirates of the Caribbean II (btw...Johnny Depp...HOT!!).  After the movie Jessica texted me kinda angry cuz Mike's ex-girlfriends are all trying to start trouble.  So I headed over to her place to hang out.  Took a bottle of rum and grey goose with me.  Well we sat around and drank that whole damn bottle of rum together.  We sat on her balcony and laughed for hours.  It was....very nice and relaxed.  I haven't had that kinda fun with girls in a long time.  We talked about so much stuff.  And she's cool.  Like it doesn't bug her at all that Mike and I made out a couple of times.  Which his ex girlfriend freaked out about.  They weren't together when we did our small thing.  But she still hated my guts because of it.  Jessica doesn't care.  So it was nice that I didn't have to hide the fact that we made out (not that it was a big deal or anything) or anything.  She knows and doesn't care and absolutely loves me, lol.  Then Mike showed up...after we polished off the rum.  I finally got to meet Sober Mike.  I've never seen the boy outside of their shows.  He's different.  In a good way.  Not like completely different...just slightly.  He kept bringing up topics and both Jessica and I would respond with ""Already covered that""  He was like ""damn is there anything you guys haven't talked about??""  lol.  It was just a night of laughs and fun.  I did find out why his ex hates me though, lol.  Apparently she found out about the first time we made out.  And she said something like how can you say you like me so much and then make out with Kel.  Well he promised it wouldn't happen again.....and it did at the next show, lol.  While he was onstage, lol.  Yes we were both drunk and all that but anyways.  I think that explains partly why she hates me.  That and she's nuts.

Anyways....this past Saturday I got to step in as band mom for the night cuz Jessica was going to be out of town.  It was kinda nice.  No one really showed up at the show so it almost seemed like a private show for those of us there.  Their 1st set sucked....Mike's voice kept cracking.  So during the 1st break I was pushing the water down his throat, lol.  Their 2nd and 3rd set were much better.  My friend Matt and his lovely wife Kara showed up.  They were fun.  We had a moment of complete insanity and giggles.  She was doing something and mimicking someone and spilled her beer all down the front of her shirt.  She lost it...then I lost it.  We laughed so hard we couldn't stand up straight.  Mike actually stopped the song to ask what the hell happened at our table.  We were laughing too hard to answer him though.  Matt played drums for a few songs.  It was just...so much fun.  After the show Mike and I headed to the diner to grab some food.  We stayed there until like 4am talking.  I found out what happened to his mom.  She killed herself almost 2 years ago.  She slit her wrists and then her throat.  After hearing that...he's holding up way better than I ever would have.  So I'm helping him design a tattoo as a memorial for her.  I was mentioning the whole friends changing bit to him at the diner.  How my circle of friends has gotten so small.  How there isn't anyone I can think of that I could call at 3am if I needed to.  He then said that I could call him.  Which was very sweet.  But then I said how I needed to get back into some of my old hobbies.  I mean I have a lot of free time to myself now.  My friendships have dwindled.  I need to get back into the things I used to really enjoy.  So he asked what type of hobbies I was talking about.  So I said that I used to love drama and choir.  I should've kept my mouth shut.  He then said ""So why don't you sing with us?""  Of course then my nerves kicked in and I threw out my excuses....I haven't really sang in over 10 years even though I did choir for over 10 years...that was a long time ago. And that I haven't sang since I started smoking.  His response was ""So what?""  So yea....I apparently have until next Tuesday to learn a song and show up at practice.  Holy shit.  Oy.  It'll be fun.  But god I hope he forgets, lol.  I mean...I want to get back into that stuff....but it also scares the shit out of me.  I don't remember my scales or anything.  At this point I don't know if I could hold a tune in a bucket, lol.

Sunday I went to the Nations vs. Padres baseball game with my dad.  That was fun.  Really fun.  It was father/daughter bonding stuff.  Of course thanks to this last weekend I'm beat and exhausted.  

I dunno...most of this is rambling.  Things are changing.  And it seems to be for the better.  Which is a good thing."

But my room is clean (at least for the next few days).  The bathroom is clean.  The kitchen needs to be re-cleaned since I cooked dinner.  Did 2 loads of laundry.  Now I'm ready for bed.

It's storming out.  I love this shit.

I wish it was friday.  Friday is the ThatGuy show at Auld Shebeen.  Saturday is the TMY show in Cville.  That ones still up in the air.  I reserved my hotel room...but I still have time to cancel if financial shit hits the fan.  The downfall to getting a room...no money to drink with.   It really depends on when my father gets my bumper ready.  If that's ready and he wants to do it on Saturday then I don't have a choice.  I'm hoping he'll say Sunday and then I can just hit Fburg on the way home from Cville.  Monday I go to MD to my cousins for drinking and swimming and partying.  That will continue on the 4th with crabs :)  Then it's back to work on Wednesday...boo!!!"

"event","Welp no BMEFest this year.  Sean cancelled.  Which actually is cool with me.  He's got a lot of stuff he's saving up for this year and neither of us realized how close it was to BMEFest.  I was starting to stress out about the money cuz it's only a week away.  So we made a pact that we'll go next year which gives us a full year to plan and put away money for it.  So that works.

Instead I'm going to go away for a day.  Get a hotel room by myself and just relax.  Now I just gotta figure out where.  I know TMY is playing on the 1st.  Which I was going to go to if I didn't do BMEFest....but that again that was also before all the shit that went down this past weekend while I was there.  So I'm undecided at this point.   I'll figure it out by the end of the weekend I guess."

If we can get 2 more people to go with us to share the expenses we can do it for about $300 a person.  I really want to go.  I need to get away.  Get away from all the people in VA that are pissing me off or making my life hell.

It'll be 2 days with modified people.  I need it.  I just....like modified people more.  They're more open minded.  They're more honest with you.  At least the ones I've met off of BME.  

It'll be 2 days of fun.  No stress.  No worries about running into people I don't want to see.  

So keep your fingers crossed that I get to go :)  Hopefully Sean will decide and tell me like...in the next day or two.  Cuz if I don't go to Toronto I gotta figure out what else to do for the holiday weekend."

"event","Another friend bites the dust that is.  I guess as I get older I get less tolerant of immature bullshit.  So the trip to Cville was....a waste of time, money and energy.  Jen and I got down there and went to see Laura and the baby.  That part was cool.  Then we went to the hotel.  After I paid for the room (mind you Jen was supposed to pay half) and got ourselves settled we hit the pool.  I managed to get stung by a bee.  I'm apparently pretty fucking allergic to them.  Ankle started swelling immediately and a lovely painful burning sensation went up my entire leg.  After about 45 min. we managed to get to CVS to get baking soda and I made a paste and got the stinger out.  The burning sensation started to dwindle down.  By the end of the night it was only up to my knee.  So the next few hours were spent reading in the room and getting ready to go out.

And here's where it all went downhill.  I had told Jen that I hoped Drew didn't show up.  I didn't want to see him.  I also said that if he did show up I hoped he just left me alone and didn't try to talk to me.  So how come after we get there.....probably  30 min later he shows up.  And Jen runs up to him and tells him he needs to say hi to me.  WTF???  What part of I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM does she not fucking understand?!!  Then the rest of the night I got to hear her moan and bitch about how I needed to talk to him cuz he looked sad.  She kept fucking pushing the issue.  Which jsut pissed me off and upset me.  

Finally we head back to the hotel where Tim and Branden meet us.  Greg stopped by as well.  Now all of them coming back didn't bother me.  I figured everyone would hang out for a bit and then leave.  Well apparently Jen invited everyone to spend the night.  Never once asking me or even telling me.  I find out when she says Tim's going to have to sleep in my bed with me.  Hold up.  We now have a way bigger issue than me just wanting to kick your ass for interferring with the Drew bullshit.  I'm sorry but I paid for the hotel room.  I'm not about to open it up to everyone.  Especially when they all live around there and can go home.  Well Tim left cuz he had to work in the morning.  Greg left.  Brandens laying in the bed with Jen.  As soon as the lights are out they start going at it.  I asked them on 3 seperate occassions to go in the bathroom and do that cuz I wanted to sleep and the last thing I wanted or needed was to hear 2 people fucking next to me.  Well they both blatantly ignored me.  So I got fed up.  Turned on the lights and started yelling at her.  I finally grabbed the car keys and stormed out of MY fucking hotel room, slamming the door.  

It took them 30 minutes to come downstairs.  Guess they had to finish what they started.  At that point I told Jen to pretty much fuck off and to go get an hour of sleep cuz we were leaving.  If I can't sleep in the hotel room I paid for I'll be damned if anyone else is.  So I gave her an hour.   Then I slammed the door open and started yelling again.  I packed up my shit and we left at 7:30am.    The 2.5 hour drive home was made in complete silence.

Branden sent me an email apologizing.  Although it wasn't his fault.  Except for not fucking listening when I said to do their shit elsewhere.  It's Jen's fault for inviting people to spend the night without checking with me.  It's her fault for ruining my night at the Lodge by trying to get me and Drew together every 5 fucking minutes.

Today Jen finally sent me an email.  All she could say was that she was drinking.  She says she doesn't remember inviting them all to stay.  She also tried to push the blame on me about Drew.  Saying she never told him to talk to me.  Which is bullshit cuz I have witnesses that heard her say it.  She also tried to say that I kept telling her I wanted to talk to him.  Another bullshit comment.  I spent the entire night staying away from him and avoiding having to be any closer than 10 feet to him.   She doesn't remember most of the evening but it's my fault not hers.  Whatever.  This isn't the 1st time she's been in inconsiderate selfish bitch to me.  I'm pretty sure if I kept her in my life it wouldn't be the last.   I'm so tired of people using the ""I was drunk"" excuse to get away with shit.  Well not with me anymore.  Doesn't work.

Grrrr.  I'm still livid.  And I'm pretty happy about my decision to be done with her.  I don't need someone around who can't control themselves when they drink.  I don't need to be around someone who's first thought is of themselves all the time.  And I don't need to be around someone who's going to meddle in things that do not concern them in any way, shape or form."

And Ivy's mom passed away at 1:55am.  It sucks because there isn't a damn thing I can do to make it all better.  Bad things always happen to good people.  I only had the pleasure of meeting her mom once....but she made sure to come out and say hi even though she wasn't feeling well.  She is truly an amazing woman who will be missed by many people.

And what sucks is that Sean is in jail for 5 days.  He went to jail yesterday and then all this happens last night.  I know Ivy could really use Sean's support right now cuz he's been through the same thing with his mother.  I haven't had to go through this so I don't know what it's like.  Yea...I've lost people close to me....but I've never had to lose a parent.  I know it's different when it's your mom or dad.

Jen and I steam cleaned the living room carpet and turned the old TV that doesn't work into a table.  Amazing what some black silk like fabric can do to a piece of shit :)  Then we set up the old twin bed that was in the spare room (after lysoling and febreezing it) up in the living room with sheets and a comforter as a place to sit.  Neatly stacked the rest of my boxes in the corners.  It's looking better.

I got to play pierce Jen saturday night.  That was fun.  I'm surprised she did it.  Now she wants to try a pulling.  I love devirginizing people to that stuff.  It'll be great to do one with her.  She's my best friend....so it's gonna be one hell of a bonding experience and a way for us to get closer.  so I can't wait.  We attempted to watch Pirates of the Carribean last night too.  Didn't work too well, lol.  We played with my new toy....well mainly I played with while she sat online and talked to someone.  Then we showered and played with needles.  Woke up at noon today.  I sat around outside and read the majority of a book I had.  That was so nice and relaxing. 

I hung up a few more pictures today.  Just taking it easy.  Gonna go to sleep early tonight (I better....I took 2 sleeping pills half an hour ago).  And then get up and go to work.  Next weekend is.....well...nothing actually, lol.  Who knows.  The weekend after that (if we can find a babysitter for Shannon) we are going to Cville to see Belle Morte and for me to get my tattoo touched up.  

I made my appointment with Scott to get my pin up girl/floor whore tattoo done in memory of Gary (a good friend of mine who died suddenly last year on May 8th).  The appointment is for May 7th.  So I'm probably gonna be an emotional wreck during the session.  But it's all good.  This will hopefully give me the closure I need on his death.  And Scott is an amazing artist so I know she'll turn out beautiful.  I can't wait.  Hopefully nothing comes up and neither of us will have to cancel.  This does mean a 2 hour drive to Carlisle PA, but it should be nice outside so it won't be so bad.  2 hours isn't much...I mean I drive 2 to 2.5 hours to Cville everytime I go.  But then again....I'll be driving home late....after hours of tattooing on my driving leg.  Hmmm.  Oh well.  It'll be worth it.  I can't wait.  I need to do this for me and Gary."

*I'm tired of feeling like I'm being used. 
*I'm tired of feeling like I'm being lied to at every turn.
*I'm tired of feeling like some people are talking about me behind my back.
*I'm tired of bending over backwards for ""friends"" who can only find time to fit me in their schedule when it's convenient for them.
*I'm tired of the fact that a lot of people made my birthday feel like a big inconvenience.
*I'm tired of the fact that I'm giving 110% to support my ""friends"" yet they can't respond by even giving 50% back.
*I'm tired of the fact that for every 1 good friend I have.....I have 2 bad friends that I can't seem to walk away from.
*I'm tired of being walked all over.
*I'm tired of being led on.
*I'm tired of the fact that I continually give people 2nd, 3rd, 4th chances and so on.......yet they still go and fuck everything up and expect another chance.
*I'm tired that I keep giving that ""one more chance""
*I'm tired of the fact that I'm supposed to feel guilty when others fuck up
*I'm tired of people who seem to think the world revolves around them....about how stressed they are....how busy they are....
*I'm tired of the fact that people no longer ask how my day was or how I'm doing.....it's always gotta be about them.
*I'm tired of being placed way down on the list and being put on the back burner every single time.
*I'm tired of being a pushover.
*I'm tired of being taken advantage of.
*I'm tired of feeling lonely...even though I'm comfortable being alone.
*I'm tired of second guessing myself.
*I'm tired of the fact that I now look in the mirror and don't recognize the person I see there.
*I'm tired of being unsure of myself and where I stand.
*I'm tired of being insecure around some people.
*I'm tired of the fact that I only seem important when it comes to a ticket sale or needing more people at shows.
*I'm tired of the fact that I can't walk away....because I would feel like a quitter or a failure.
*I'm just tired of everything.


Yea....it was a long drive. And if you think that was written about you...well then..more than likely it was. If you read that list and feel even a twinge of guilt....then you're responsible for making me feel that way at some point...if not at all times. Those that are really close to me can ignore it. As my real friends know who they are and I know where I stand with them. The people who made me compile that list....well...I can honestly say I don't know where I stand with them as I'm told one thing....and then they turn around and spout something completely different to someone else....and it gets back to me. I'm just tired of the bullshit and of feeling stupid and unsure of myself because of someone elses actions and words.

And wouldn't you know who wrote and apologized.  *rolls eyes*  I dunno.  I'm at the point where I'm fed up...but I don't know what to do.  I guess there's something wrong with me.  Who knows.  Maybe I'll figure it out someday.  Maybe not."

"event","I'm thrown for a loop.  Some random chick on IAM (as in:  iam.bmezine.com) has been hitting on me...blatantly for the past 2 days.  It always surprises me when someone thinks I'm attractive  *shrug*  But she's cute :)

I got my other nipple redone last night.  I love Sean, lol.  I was petrified.  This is the 7th time getting it pierced.  So there's a bit of scar tissue (which surprisingly...makes it 10x more sensitive now).  Well he no longer uses clamps, so he did it freehand.  Well...that was sooo much LESS painful.  No real pain except for when he put the barbell in.  That stung a bit.  And I woke up today with no pain or soreness at all.  Sweet!!!  Still sucks having to get it redone (thanks to Drew for ripping it out..argh).  But at least it was a good piercing experience and didn't involve me crying like a wimp.

Then Missa and I went and saw my friend Matt's cover band, That Guy.  They were a trip.  Very good and funny.  An overall fun night."

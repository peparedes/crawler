Why didn't they just cancel because nothing is going to get done today.  So I get to sit at a computer for a few hours where all the good sites are vlocked and play around.  Well ebay, amazon, and survey sites here I come.  If anyone knows a cure for college boredom do share.  Thought I would give the insite to all you fine folks hope all is good in your hood .... ....... wow that was random."

"event","So another day another way to do it all wrong.  So i find it funny that even in a small 3 story school you still find ways to avoid people.  There is someone I used have a class with and she was nice.  Now she doesn't have a thing to do with me.  So lesson don't ask someone out, they overreact and ignore you and act 2 years old.  Whatever, don't care.  So back to my bad luck, it comes and goes now I got my Wii so that covers January but what will happen next.  so I fell today in the school parking lot and they treated it like I was gonna die.  So something is different there.  I also got some virtual console games, and note I found my wii console number but I keep forgetting to put it in my pocket.  The virtual console is cool, but oh my goodness I think I play it more than the 2 games I have.  Well school blocked some more websites, and this is the only thing I have left.  Well time to go, peace out later yo and holla."

"event","So it figures, everytime I vent and complain, something happens and it makes me look foolish.  So yesterday was victorious but bad in the same sense.  I stopped by gamestop at 1:30 was told to come back at 3, went back and because they ""misplaced a wii"" I was able to get one.  Went home in just enough time to set everything up and go to work at 4.  Managed to make a mii and play one round of bowling before I left.  So Bowling first time one my wii 170.  Came home at ten, bowled 5 more.  168,170,168,170,172.  Thats consistant.  took the fitness test woo age 31.  Had enough time for that and then to bed.  Now at school work all weekend but monday will have some time.  No games besides wii sports, but bowling will take up alot of time.  And all I had to do to repay gamestop was preorder wii play and 2 more games later on.  Shouldn't be too hard, there are some fun stuff coming out.  So with all my bad luck I found some good, work sucks now more than ever, everyone is getting ready to quit which will leave me to do all the work.  Tough times call for stregnth.  Will make it through and I dislike people in trucks.  I got hit with a half eaten hamburger.

"event","So I am part Irish, which means that I should have some good luck, but as of late I am not having any.  So like alot of the world I have been in pursuit of a Wii.  I had someone helping me out, someone was going to hold one for me, but that ended up not working out so well.  Then I got the shipment schedule and was where I needed to be when I needed to be there and 3 days in a row they were supposed to arrive and 3 days they did not.  Now I almost bet that the day I can not be where I need to be, they will arrive and I will miss out.  Its getting interesting, and my bad luck is being interesting.  I have no intention of going to ebay, I will wait as long as needed, but I won't pay over 250.  Also my luck other places is bad, I have been hit by a tree thanks to the wind, had a can thrown at me from a car and my word processing files all got deleted.  Someone send some luck my way, whether it be wii related, school related or otherwise.  So thats it on my end, I would say I found some luck in work, because I was getting promoted to shift leader at Quizno's, but yeah they screwed me there too.  I get to close once a week and have a key, but no promotion, or raise.  Thats life, I guess.

"event","Too much to say, don't care to say it.  It would all sound like whining anyway so here is the short and minor detail of the last eight months.  So in April, I moved ... ... ... sorry had to think.  With a little help from a friend or two I found a job and apartment down in greenwood, but I said last eight months so.  Back in February all was well life was good, no complaints.  Was a mechanic/snack bar/porter at the bowling alley working forty hours.  Even had a woman at the time but she wasn't that great now that I know what happened in february(how do you spell that?)  now, so no worries literally.  Got into it with the world in march, after I turned twenty-one.  That was a good two weeks, drank, worked, drank, worked, ... you get the picture.  Anyway third week in march things turned a little sour, so decided to move.  Now back to April/March.  So last little while in march with help found an apartment/job.  Moved out on the ninth.  Did not even see the apartment until that sunday night (someone had filming to do ... which I was involved in ... HOW ABOUT THAT SPEEDING TICKET ... ""how fast were you going""  ""Too fast"") moved had a job in a theatre, saw a friend every two weeks or so, went back into solitude and sanctity of my own mind ... So did not save money ahead of time, kind of half-assed the whole moving thing so when rent came the first month, not so good.  It all worked out.  Truthfully never had enough money anyway, but the next two months the theatre paid my bills and rent left me with about fifteen bucks a check for groceries, luckily free movies took care of the entertainment.

  Also in April got rid of my woman ... in June was told what happened in Feb... by her but nevermind if you want the details some other time.  So I think I am at Jume now, stayed with the theatre same deal they paid bills and rent had little money luckily my parents/aunt and uncle/friends helped with food, dishes, table, basically anything I would need but a toaster, and a blender.  July comes around, I start looking for secondary work, but like most of what I do I was too lazy to get out and look, so I stayed with the same routine.  And its all downhill from here ..........................

July twenty-ninth went out to lunch with a friend from work celebrating his departure from the theatre and return to school, hoping the same would be said for me sometime soon.  Got a call to work for someone, went in at five pm and was gone by seven thirty.  So apparently if someone cant hear you (June eleventh) you get repremanded.  If your drawer is 1.01 short on a four hour shift (sometime in may)  If some lady wishes you dead and you tell her where to go and what to do (night before the deaf guy) and a recently laid off husband tries to pay, but his still employed wife pays because her money was down on the counter first (July 29th) They fire you for a bad attitude.  So unemployment was filed to this day nothing.  Went in the next day turned in the uniform unwashed thats just me being bitter.  ignored by the higher ups.  The next month is pretty quick.  Had the money to pay august rent.  Went job hunting nothing, forced to sell part of video game collection to pay September rent.  got an interview that ended good luck on that job hunt.  Participated in medical research involving and IV and alcohol.  pays october rent.  Now the present day.  No job no income somehow a little bit of food and I have til October 15th until the ride is over.

If nothing is found by then my father pays the 1000 lease breaking fee (actually I think it is higher not sure) pays to cancel my electric and phone and I move home to mom and dad and am in debt for a few years.  have turned in 21 applications so far and only one reply.  When I visit them asking same response still being reviewed.  

With all of that in the books I hope because of my misfortune someone else is doing well.  Things for me will work out, I may disappear for a year or three, but it will work out.  

Now I will go home tomorrow (I am at my parents because of internet) keep at the jobs and see if I can make my total of apps turned in reach fifty.

I will make it back to write on November first to tell the second part of this tale.

Note: I am here for 24 more hours if anyone has a comment and wants a quick reply, otherwise I have to visit the library in a week so I will reply then.

Note:  I left out alot of stuff if anyone wants to know anything else let me know."

So have you ever wanted something, but only wanted it after it was too late.  I think I screwed up big time.  So apparently if a girl states she loves you, thank you is not the proper response.  Maybe once or twice, but for months.  Long story, but anyway this proves that I am meant to die alone.  I really got to try harder in life.

"event","So anyway I turned 21 last Sunday (6th)  Started it out right.  Went to The Argosy Riverboat Casino at midnight with my parents, got my first alcoholic beverage legally, won a hundred dollars, got my second alcoholic beverage, which was the birthday drink.  Both of my drinks were Rum Punch (Rum, Orange Juice, Cherry Syrup)  also Grapefruit juice, but when I stated my brithday and my winnings, the bartender filled the glass 3/4 of the way with rum and sang happy birthday to me.  All of this on an empty stomach kids!  So I learned what alcohol does to me.  Besides not walking straight, It relaxed me and I went to sleep on the ride home.  

Next day Actually my birthday, so for months my boss told me show up at noon I will buy you a drink.  This one consisted of

1 shot Jack Daniels
1 Shot Southern Comfort
1 shot Crown Royal
1/2 shot Absolute Vodka
1/2 cup pepsi or coke

Only because I was walking he left out

1 shot Jim Beam
1 shot absolute vodka
1 shot triple sec
1 shot some other whiskey

So thank goodness for walking, needless to say I drank it, and it didn't phase me either.  I had food on my stomach otherwise ... yeah.

So I am legal and I haven't drank well but once since my birthday.  I came home tonight from work craving a drink.  I found the orage juice and my mom found my some vodka.  I love my parents, note:  My mom bought my first drink.

So with all of that said, look me up when you turn 21 hopefully it will be as rememberable."

Sorry i really dislike that song but sadly it is fused into my brain and will be for awahile.  For those not aware, that song is Take it away by The used off their newest album in love and death.  Buy the song on itumes or the album in any major store.

Shalmeless plug aside, folks I really can't tell you how happy I am, mainly because I am not.  I have depression again, well I always have it but it went away for a while 2 days to be honest and now its back.  To give an explanation to those I have not spoken to, or those I don't share my life with, heres the last month or so ... a little long than that

Start of november, everything is okay could be better but no complaints.  Soon after that I lose hours at work and gain some new ones in return.  I am now a mechanic at the bowling alley, but I still cook so don't eat there.  Really it is way to expensive.  So I lost on average about twelve hours a week, but anyway I was still working 20.  

So the middle of november hits, I start pursuing a new relationship with a girl I work with.  Well after twenty years I still don't understand why women act the way they do towards me.  Anyway I never got the nerve to ask for a date, because of her actions and behavior towards me, but it turns out she would have gone on a date with me and who knows where i'd be.  

End of novemeber a girl I bowl against in a league asks me on a date.  Things are looking good, going my way again.  Getting some more hours at work due to people vacationing, going on dates with a lovely girl, nothing's wrong with that.  

Middle of december I start dating the girl in my league, supe one year single, I kept my promise, nevermind that thoug, she I no longer speaking to me I am apart of her life she wants to forget, to clarify that statement is about my old girlfriend not the one that bowls.  So now I have a girlfriend yet again, we go out christmas is starting to come around friends are starting to come home, most of which spoke to me while they were home.  To the ones that did not, your loss.

New years eve Me and my girlfriend go to the party at the bowling alley, went very well, night went off with no problems, and it was the first time I had seen my woman all week.  More on that later.

New year starts and now here we are, well the snack bar got a new menu, so I had to be retrained to the higher quality foods and pepsi products.  So now we carry angus beef, higher qualitie nachos, cheese and chicken.  Also we have wings not BW's but a good substitution.  Now back to my ...  anyway needless to say it all went to hell, the snack stayed good, I have 29 hours a week at work so now why is my life hell.

As of yesterday due to the lack of time being spent with me I am now single, it only took two weeks this time around.  Hell my first relationship was a year and a half.  There was no time for me after two jobs, a sick grandmother, and family, so it ended in a good way, who knows we might go out again, she still speaks to me and we will still hang out and go out, just not exclusively.  That shouldn't make my life hell, so what does.  I have depression again after kicking it once, I am losing hours again at work, I am single, I have some other problems which need not be discussed at this time, and I am alone, everyone is at school again.


For the record her name is Jessica.

Goodbye everyone, I would say I will give more updates like this, but I'd be lying I will update once a month or so as usual and most of it will be nonsense psychobabble.  I am sane I promise I just don't like normality and just a stab ... I mean note.  Conformity is okay, conform if you want to, hell everyone else does in one way or another.

hugs kisses and evil grins

So everything finally comes together in my life, I took care of the rumors said, I earned trust and more hours at work, I recently have had somewhat of a social life, so no problems good peachy, hell I even got motivated to write another story, but didn't finish it yet.

Now to the present, Everything is falling in towards my head, like earlier I didn't care, it will work out, or I will die ... yeah it will work out.  but I turn around only to see that everything that was fine is now anger, hatrid, and jealousy.  Oh boy what a tangled web we weave.

I never did though, I saw it as two things the easy way out (and I never do things the easy way) amd its kind of permanent.

I am finding it hard to find positives in my life, everyone is turning so negative and I keep hearing and meeting people who just want to die.  How is it possible for that many people to hold the same feelings.  Hell I hold those feelings once a month or so, ""there is nothing for me here!  I just think life would be easier for everyone else if I was gone!  I'll show them all, I'll end it all and then they will see!""  But I would never go as far as to do anything about it.  I know that talking to someone will help, but it is really hard to turn to someone when you know that something like this will change their opinion of you, but as for me honestly if I cared what anyone thought of me, I would have done ended it all by now.  I really hope for those that are depressed and have problems with your life you do find a solution that lets you live.  You never know you could go on to achieve your greatest goals someday, but not if you are dead.

I know this will change opinions about me, but just remember who is writing this I say what I want to and I am trying to help anyone that needs it.  Some peaople's problems can be ended by a simple conversation, I am just pointing that out, now my problems they will end the day I die.  I hope someone will find this useful

Remeber pet will listen to anything you say, and they do not talk back.  

Stay true to your beliefs.

As for everyone that was part of my plan ... sorry we lost you"

Yesterday, I went on my 2nd vacation of the year, I recently won 4 tickets to Holiday world.  It isn't the greatest trip, but it got me somewhere for a day.  That makes 2 years in a row that me and my parents have won tickets and gone down there.  So no real complaints there, but I have a funny story there.  I worked that Saturday until 2 a.m. and I decided that there was no real reason of sleeping considering that we were leaving at 6 a.m.  So I hung out with a couple of people that I knew from high school that came to bowl.  Also my fellow employees seem to try to be setting me up with the new employee.  Only problem with her, Ritter graduate.  So I'll see where that goes, I told her I was irresistable, but she didn't believe me.  I need to start a petition for everyone to sign, stating I am irresistable.

Well, I got invited to Fort Waybe by one of the girls I knew from that program.  Went up sunday after work, so about eight thirty at night.  S;ept on the hard floor of an apartment for 3 days, ate alot of free and employee discounted McDonalds.  i also met a group of interesting people.  They are Pot smoking Video game addicts.  Nice people, but the drugs made them very philosophical.  butched that word but oh well.  Overall here's what I accomplished.  I didn't get to see my friend that much, because of classes and work.  I went to the art musuem, mall, and the house of her parents in Legrange Indiana.  Also I got up there and back, because one of her friends was kind enouugh to come and get me and take me back.  The ride there and back consisted of chilling in the back seat listening to 4 different Insane Clown Posse Ablums, some of that stuff is funny.

I hope if I visit again, I will actually get to see the person I go to visit.  Anyone else want to house me for a day or too.  that was actually fun.  I paid gas money for both trips.

no more nonsense.

Working it up, and being bowled over.  A new story in process for those who care about my summer.  Going to add a few items and take out a few items, but for the most part it will be accurate.

Got a new reason to care.  I had to sit down with my immediate boss the other day to talk schedules, either upcoming filling in or fall and winter schedules.  Looks like I will have alot to do in August and September.  When I get the final word I will post that way if anyone wants to bowl they can come see me and bowl at the same time.  As of now I am looking at 30 hrs. maybe more or less, and a 13 cent raise in october.  To clarify 13 cents is equal to a 2% raise.  

Also I have been keeping eyes on gas station 3rd shift jobs.  I think that would be fun, but at the same time that is when most gas stations get robbed, so that would be interesting.  I am keeping in mind everything though, so any 3rd shift would be nice, but one job is enough now.

ADVERTISEMENT:  Leagues are staring at AMF raceway lanes, located right across th street from the IMS, and I encourage anyone to join mainly because my job and bonuses depend on league bowlers.  any questions drive over and look at the options of the leagues or ask me.  

In the past week I have managed to get everything in order for the winter and fall, now all I have to do is wait for it all to happen.  Also I think I might become more social and try to get out a little more.  I am going to try to make a trip downtown once a month and go see a movie or something like that.  Also I need to shop for birthdays, christmas well maybe not yet, but I can find plenty to do.

Now I am sure that 90percent of the people that read this didn't make it all the way through but skimmed it, so I am going to sum up everything into one paragraph for the lazy people

I am fat and need to lose weight, no one likes me because I do not shower often enough and I have had relations with the entire female ward of the mental hospital, and have come down with paranoia and not knowing how to spell.  Thats what you get for being lazy you bums

I have decided to continue planning, and throw my plans into action.  I am planning to get in shape, make my knees in better condition and increase my lung capacity.  Long story behind that one, and as for everything else, started a while ago and going to finish.  Daily walks through speedway, pass familiar sites and new ones.  Exercise and lift more weight at work, and find other things to do.  

I found something else funny but at the same time aggrivating.  I took the entire week off, hoping to do something fun or different, and so far have not done anything.  Once again, made some plans and the went sour.  I have Saturday and Sunday off, and yet once more what plans I had went sour.  If anyone has any sort of plans of fun for the weekend, feel free to include me.  As for making plans, I am going to give up on that end, just think hours ahead instead of weeks.

Finally as a final thought, is it wrong to dream of the future?  and for the future to be the same as the dream?  That usually isn't bad, but given my dark and sadistic mind, things aren't looking pretty for me.  No death or injuries, well none physical anyway, but I will harmed in other ways, but hey what's new.  I walk around with nothing to hide and no worries, and sometimes I pay for it.  

Also as an off note my dad told me to go out and find a girl today, I like that idea, but that requires me to get out on my off time, not sit around or walk to streets of speedway.  I wish the bus went more places!

There isn't too much that I have to say, to start, I am going to quit posting on Live Journal, maybe not permanently, but definetly for awhile.  There isn't too much to what I have to say anymore.  Most of what I say doesn't matter, and is pointless anyway.  If anyone wants to speak to me, I am in the phone book, you all know where I live, and I am more than willing to take anyone out to lunch and speak of old times, and new occurances.  Since this is my final word to some of you, I have a couple of things worth mentioning.  I do plan on going to college, for what purpose is undecided, but I am going.  One more year of money saving, than goodbye Speedway, and Indianapolis for awhile.  Hello ... somewhere.  Because of my inability to care about school, not too many schools want me, but thats the way I live my life.  Its a challaneg, but honestly, its my own fault for this happening, so no one's to blame.  I did manage to get better the last year of school, and I blame those who helped me and tried to see me to graduation.  Thanks for that.  High School had memories, some of which I skipped, and I am glad.  Prom, missed that, the 2 post proms and kings Island trips, made those.  Everything related to band, some good some bad, doesn't really matter.  It all worked in the end.  I think it is fitting to do one more update for anyone who cares.

--------------------

In the past few months, I have been eagerly raising money for college and many other things.  Danny put it well when he saw my room, I could have gone to college this year, but I found better things to spend money on.  Life as a snack bar attendant is better, now that I am not as slow as I used to be.  I make good tips, when I work.  Now I just work Saturday and Sunday nights, a 9 hr. week.  I have been trying to find a site to restart and begin writing some of my short stories, but I think that will be delayed.  I am currently working on one of my many dreams again.  I am writing a series of stories to put in a book, to send to publishers.  If anyone wants to read these stories, I can send them to you one at a time, or stop by my house, I will have copies.  I have titled the book as well, so things are looking upwards in that department.  As for the relationship department, if the fear of rejection ever leaves, it may get better.  Also I continue to collect, Gamecube games (60), Gameboy games, CDs, and movies.  Also I actually made it out of the house last Thursday to see Something Corperate, Yellowcard, The Format, and Sleeping at last at the Murat Egyptian Room, 18.50 for all four bands.  I was there to see Yellowcard, but enjoyed the entire show.  Managed to meet Sleeping at last, get their autograph, and talk them into playing a show down the line at the bowling alley.  Also left with 2 bruised knees, a sore neck, very large headache due to being kicked by 4 crowd surfers, and wet clothes.  I stood in the rain for 2 hours to be close to the stage.  When I left I was still soaked, in water and sweat.  U would do it all agian tomorrow if I had a chance.  

Thats it kiddies, remember if want to hear from me call, or visit, I will take you to lunch or something.  I expect to hear from at least 2 of you.  Until you see me, or I see you 

Goodbye, and Goodluck

I took an hour cut from 5-midnight now to 8:30 in the monrnig to 3 in the afternoon.  

Thats ok for now, I really wish I could get some hours, but thats besides the point.  

I am taking a break on Saturday, and the boss walks down and decides that I need something to do.  So me and Dustin, the porter (cleans tables, moves balls, etc) had to go clean the walls and stalls of both bathrooms.  I protested and stated that was not in my job description.  It wouldn't matter to me, except he has a cleaning crew who gets paid very nicely to clean.  Later I found out the boss said that the cleaning crew was not obligated to clean the bathrooms.  

That ends, and before we can sit down, another job.  Unwrap new bowling balls, and replaces the old ones on the racks.  That did some problems with my back, but later it was worth it.  We got to throw the old ones in the dumpster.  I just tossed them over the fence.

End of Saturday

Sunday worked becaused the guy was busy ... Made 8 pizzas, 2 of which called in.

"event","I wish I wasn't so logical. I'm working in Charlotte starting in January, and my parents, being reasonably close, think it would be wise if I stayed with them for a year. I would have to agree. It allows me a chance to save money to put a down payment on a place of my own. Also, if something were to happen the first year in my job, then I wouldn't be stuck with a place I couldn't pay for and have to move back home.

Like I said, it makes sense. However, my parents drive me up the wall. Yes, I imagine most people love their parents, but I'm past the age where I want to be actively parented and bossed around like I'm twelve. Last time I was home, my mom was discussing me living with them. I&nbsp; only have to follow the house rules. Really, I'm down with chores and helping out, because it is free rent. However, my mom said, ""you know and you need to tell us where you'll be and when you'll get in."" Really? I don't think it's their business, and my mom won't like some of the places where I'm likely to be. I understand that her and dad are overprotective about my safety, since I'm a girl, and I appreciate the concern. Unfortunately, that means I'll have to lie about my whereabouts forty percent of the time, if I live at home.

I don't like to lie. I have a moral aversion to it, but I also hate shattering my parents' image of me. It'll just stress my mom out, like when she found out I *gasp* drink alcohol occasionally.&nbsp; Therefore, it's necessary to stretch the truth in some instances. If I was out of the house, it wouldn't be a problem. 

However, I don't want to rent a place. I've done it in college and thrown away a ton of money. I want to buy something small like an apartment, condo, townhouse, patio home, etc. I plan on staying in Charlotte for a good while. I'm a little disappointed that I wasn't assigned to the Richmond office now, because then, I would have to live away from home. Gah. 

Anyway, the game plan right now is for me to have a discussion with my parents about my ground rules, to explain to them, respectfully, that I'm an adult now. I still respect them, but I have to make my own decisions and live my own life, even if I'm living with them. My work will have to come before anything they want done around the house, because otherwise, if I don't finish something, I might get fired. Also, I will do my part of the work, when I have ample time and within a reasonable time period. However, I would appreciate it if they&nbsp; would make requests, like they would when speaking to each other, instead of commands. ""Anna, get in here and do this."" No. Not going to work. I think my parents are pretty reasonable, my dad more so than my mom, so hopefully, it'll work out."

"event","So I'm waiting to hear if I got the job I desperately want, and it's incredibly nerve-racking.

I went to Richmond, VA this past Tuesday to interview for an IT consulting job. I love the company, the people, and everything about the work, so if I don't get it now, I'll try to get a bit more experience and reapply. I really need a year off though, either way, because I am sick of school. I hear Starbucks and Barnes and Noble offer their employees health insurance.

I don't think the wait would be as difficult if I knew I was the top candidate who applied for the position. Unfortunately, I was one of the least qualified, because I'm not computer science or computer engineering. Still, I'm bright and hopefully my cheerful personality will count for something. It's just so hard to be rejected from something you know you want to do...and I've already been rejected by two other companies(and it's not like I have a bad GPA or zero work experience). 

And as much as I want the job, I hope I'm stationed somewhere near Eddie."

"event","<div text=""School-yawn."" class=""ljcut"">This semester started out well. My roomie, Robin, moved out. This is a good thing. She constantly stressed me out, treating me like her younger sister and giving me grief about my boyfriend, Eddie. <br /><br />On top of that, I have an enjoyable workload this semester. Since I'm graduating in December, I only had to take two required courses this semester, the rise of modern science and statistics. That means I have a lot of electives in my schedule. Please, try to contain your jealousy. <br /><br />M W F<br /><br />9:10 - 10:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The RISE of Modern Science<br />10:15 - 11:05&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statistics<br />11:20 - 12:10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swim Conditioning<br />1:30 - 2:45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creative Nonfiction Workshop<br /><br />T TH<br />11:45 - 1:00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intro to Philosophy<br />1:30 - 2:45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiction Writing<br />3:40 - 4:30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoga<br /><br />I'm also still working approximately twenty hours a week as a Java I TA. It's not a lot of fun. Mainly, a bunch of students come and ask me a lot of repetitive questions, while I try to be nice for three hours at a time. I need the money though, since I want to move into my own apartment come December. <br /><br />My writing classes are the best thing about this semester. I've been really busy, but I'm enjoying it. I had my first short story critiqued last week, and now, I'm revising it. There's a short story contest sponsored by NC State, and I want to enter my story (because it's going to kick major honeybuns).<br /><br />&nbsp;I've also written a hometown piece, a companion to the one I wrote last semester about Waxhaw, to describe my move to Indian Trail. Not to mention, I killed off Tony Blair on Wednesday, since I had to write his obituary for my nonfiction class.&nbsp; Good times. <br /><br />I'm pretty much on my own this year. Most of my friends have either graduated or are cooping at home. It's a little lonesome. I have some regrets about leaving NC State this semester. It's a shame that I haven't made any long-term friendships with my classmates. Well besides Eddie that is, but since we're dating, I don't count him. I'm just starting to connect with some people in my writing classes, and now, I have to leave. It's rather sad, but maybe, I won't have to live so far away. <br /><br />I'm also pretty stressed out about looking for a job this semester. I've never really liked the math I learned beyond my freshman year, but logical me wanted a major that was versatile in the business world. I think now, if I hadn't hated English so much in high school, I might have gotten my degree in creative writing or English education. Not that it's too late, but I'll need health insurance when I graduate, and you have to have a full time job to get that or be enrolled in&nbsp; grad school. I haven't taken the GRE, so I haven't applied for any program yet. There lies my problem. Do I continue with math, because it will allow me to make a decent living, or do I go to grad school in something completely unrelated and struggle to get by? Sometimes, I think that doing what I love isn't worth the cost it would take. However, if that's the case, I must not really love it. Still, there are always practicalities in life that need to be looked at when making decisions. I don't love money, but it's necessary to survive. Therefore, it only makes sense that you choose a profession that generates a decent amount of income to survive. Still, there are quite a few things that I have at the moment that I could live without, health insurance is not one of them, because I tend to have weird medical problems spontaneously crop up. Of course, there's always the possibility of achieving both income and doing what you love, but I think that would require me to work part time which would be difficult when I'm just starting out. I'm in such a pickle.<br /><br />Sorry, this is probably more than you guys wanted to know about my school year thus far. But, oh well, this is my now.</div>"

The cell phone people were obnoxious. They were like omgz you don't want 2 text?! I was like,&nbsp; ""No. I want a phone that I can call 911 on if someone's after me, no bells and whistles please."" That and fancy pants stuff costs the big $$$. 

Oh yeah...and we're getting high speed internet and cable for the first time in my life, lol. It didn't hurt me a bit growing up only being able to make out three channels, but I was really worried I wasn't going to be able to watch So You Think You Can Dance tonight. I am so obsessed with that show. I finally learned some of the ballroom styles this year at college: rumba, samba, waltz, cha-cha, swing, foxtrot, and shag. It's a lot of fun to watch them dance when you know all the technical aspects to a dance, even when you don't. It's on tonight from 8-10pm on Fox, if anyone wants to watch."

"event","I've&nbsp; basically been MIA for the last month, since my family is moving to a new church in Indian Trail, NC. My dad is going to be the new pastor at Faith UMC starting this coming Sunday. Moving has been a blooming nightmare. 

The church was supposed to buy a parsonage, the house where the preacher stays, before we got there. However, there's been a ton of miscommunication between the church members, and then, the person who has to make the final decision went on vacation for two weeks. We still don't have a house, so we've been frantically putting all of our stuff into storage and are currently shacked up in a three bedroom apartment. We're supposed to stay here for three months while the church continues hunting for a house which means we'll be moving two times instead of once.

Also, I had to pack our entire house, since both my parents have been working. However, this past week it's been all my family can do just to finish up everything and clean our house and get it ready for the new pastor. We finally finished up the last of our chores at our old house today and are starting getting situated in the apartment. I'm currently snagging someones wireless until dad gets *crosses fingers* HIGH SPEED I-NET which will be one of the perks of living here. It's actually not too bad for the limited space, if it didn't stress my mom out, not having a permanent place to live. There's a nice pool too. My room is actually pretty cute as well.

Oooh! I finally have a car. A cute little green Honda, but I&nbsp; have to share it with Jonathan until school starts. 

Eddie came and visited this past weekend, and we went to the comic book convention. I dressed up as a pirate in this pink and black almost goth looking dress and black ballooning dance pants. People kept wanting me to pose and let them take my picture. I got to slit Eddie's throat about five or six times.

We ate Ri Ra's downtown where I got to try some Guinness, which I thought was gross. I pretty much only like girly drinks, but Eddie said it's pretty good as far as beer goes. While I was there, this lady asked me where I worked, and I told her that I dressed up for a comic book convention. She kept asking me questions about, because she thought it was so bizarre that I was dressed like a pirate.The kiddies in the restaurant loved it though.

Oh yeah, and my dad almost went postal because I *gasp* sat on Eddie's lap. I mean c'mon guys you know that's how babies get made. ;) Mom laughed it off, but she said it was just because he wasn't used to seeing his ""little girl"" with a guy. It's sweet, but it irritating. *shrug*

Anyways, I'm hoping things slow down in a few days, so my mom and I can go chill in the mountains for a few days."

"event","<p>My computer went down the crap shoot this week. I'm pretty sure it needs a new hard drive, but it's near impossible for me to get off campus to do anything during the week. It shouldn't be too expensive to fix, for a computer at least, but it's money I don't have at the moment.&nbsp;<br /><br />On top of that, about every assignment I have to do is computer based at this point in my math/programming career. Not having a computer is a mathematician's hell.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have a rough draft of a short story due tomorrow. It has to be at least five pages by then. I have no plot. I did NaNoWriMo, so this should be no problem, correct? Wrong. I can't think of a blasted thing to write, and that's after my professor was all like ""Your writing is out of this world. I expect great things from your short story."" That was the kiss of death if anything ever was.&nbsp;<br /><br />I have to finish about a gazill other things this week with about everything going wrong simultaneously. I'm stressed. My face is breaking out. I'm not happy at the moment.</p>"

Tir Ra Nog had the really cool pub tables with the barley twist carving on their legs. My parents are going to get one like it for our house. The Hibernian has a tad more eclectic decorating scheme as opposed to other. They also had traditional Irish music last night. I was cracking Eddie up, because I knew quite a few of the songs and *gasp*&nbsp; quite a few were Irish drinking songs. It was fun times. <br/><br/>*scowls* Now, I have to go work on Matlab for another six hours. I *hate* math. </font></font>"

My parents surprised my brother and I with a trip they've been planning for several months. I cannot even begin to describe how stoked I am. 
We have tickets to Wicked!, since I am such a big musical freak. I've been listening to the soundtrack for over a year and have read the novel as well, so the anticipation is killing me. I'm also going to have tea (the British civilized kind) with my mom in New York . I would be happy with any destination though, because I just enjoy being with my family. However, if I got to pick (which I didn't), I would say that being with the family in New York would be the hotness (and it's going to be!).

Safe travels to everyone else going on break! Enjoy the time you have with the people you love, whether family or otherwise."

"event","Eddie and I are back together again. Obviously, things won't be the same for a while. Some things will never be the same again. It seems everyday that goes by my life become a little more complicated.

I used to pride myself on my excellent judgment. Now, I'm just not sure about anything anymore. I know God is always with me, and that's a wonderful feeling, always having someone there to catch me when to I fall and watch over me. In my relationship with Eddie, I am hitting a lot of gray areas in my conscience that I have never hit before. I'm living on a day to day basis in the real world, trying to trust in God's wisdom, when my best friend doesn't agree with me. Robin always loves me, but she definitely does not think I should get back with Eddie. It's difficult to go against the grain with someone you love, but either way I decided that would happen.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm scared, because either way I will ""lose"" someone I love. It's like playing Russian roulette with a fully loaded gun. I told her today that the risk was worth the cost. I most likely will eat my words one day, but for now, I am just going to trust God that he will let me up right where I need to be."

I'm still nervous about the amount of verbage I need to crank out, but I feel slightly calmer, slightly more hopped up on coffee (currently 7 cups).<br /><br />Well, I didn't plan on my MC having a nervous breakdown today. I mean she was pretty chill with being thrust into a realm of over-glorified librarians and crazed demons before I went to bed last night. Ahhh, guess that's the life of a guardian entity. One day you're wearing chucks and blue jeans taking a walk down the street, the next you're dealing with cutthroat other realm politics. Life is good.<br /><br />So today, as I was typing my 2,000+ words to Beyonce's 'Check up on it', when I realized that I still needed a slightly evil sounding name for the antagonist in my story. After brainstorming for the perfect surname, I had my 'aha!' moment and decided that he was to be called.. Mortimer. My roomie then promptly yelled from the other room, ""That's the name of Mickey the Mouse!!"" ""What?!"" ""..before he was Mickey, you know."" *Severe Case of Writer's Block* Needless to say, there was no way in deepest regions of the underworld that I was going to name my sinister, brilliant, corrupt..well you get the picture after one of Disney's progeny. <br /><br />I had also planned a huge council meeting today, but my character took too much time in self-reflection.  Does anyone else feel like that they spend 75% of their words explaining and describing happenings within their novel, but there is far less action happening on a daily basis? I'm actually pumped up to write tomorrow, because I'm like ""Oooh! I have all the foundations set, so now something COOL can happen!"""

My fall break starts this week on Wednesday. Dane and I are riding home together, and we, surprisingly, have the same plans for the weekend with our families.  I get to spend an entire weekend in the mountains, :D. My mom and I are going to see ""I Love you,You're perfect, Now change"".  We'll probably end up eating at one of my favorite places, the Jarrett House.  I can taste the biscuits now!

My apartment situation has turned into Survivor with a Robin-Anna alliance.  We know that one of the other mates has to be lying to us. They each tell us the other says one thing, and then, when we confront that person, they say the exact opposite.  I'm getting really fed up with it, because they have problems with something in the apartment, but they won't say it to the person's face.  They just go and talk about it behind the other person's back. I mean seriously, get some balls! If you have something to say, say it to the person in question, or at least, admit that you said it. We're big kids.

Wow, when people aren't direct, it makes me angry.

I have to finish my mid-term paper on Queen of Elizabeth and how she utilized her gender and ""propaganda machine"" to rule England. I also have to discuss the relationship between the Church of England and British nationalism at that time. I have pretty detailed notes written out already, so it shouldn't take too long. However, my history prof is a beast when it comes to grading papers. He grades like we're history majors, :P. I'm a bit worried, since it's a good portion of my grade."

I have been threatening to do it.

I finally did it.

That's right! MA 426 went down the big drop hole. I officially hate analysis.
(and I need it for grad work, but that's another story)

I'm still full-time with that drop, but that means I'll have more time for working in
the TA office, sleeping, and chillin (and maybe studying :P).

Dr. Paur was really nice about me dropping the course too.&nbsp; 
She said she realized I had been really struggling trying to understand the 
material.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it's just not going into this brain of mine (I even tried sleeping 
with my book under my pillow. Osmosis didn't work either.)&nbsp; She was 
totally supportive of me dropping the class even to just get more sleep.
She's a fabulous lady, but gosh darn does she teach a difficult course."

I've been pretty exhausted the past few weeks, tired with life. I keep pressing on, because I know that's what
I should do, but everything keeps becoming increasingly difficult/complicated.&nbsp; I believe that God has a purpose for my
&nbsp;life that is unique to me, Anna the one and only. Everything just feels so wrong right now.&nbsp; I'm not the slightest bit
intrigued with my mathematics courses and programming has become an empty pastime. I am dissatisfied with living
at status quo with the world and myself.&nbsp; I turn on the news I see pain and hardship perpetuated everywhere, but where 
am I? Living a middle class lifestyle and attending college in America.&nbsp; My heart aches daily for the nations. I feel a hand
on my soul stretching its fibers until I feel disconnected with the society I live in, calling me elsewhere.&nbsp; I know I could never 
feel like I am answering the call, the overwhelming challenge God has put on my life if I spent it living in suburbia, working at a 
computer screen.&nbsp; My college degree may just be a stepping stone, a ticket to taking the evangelism initiative in
other countries.&nbsp; I've got a lot of praying to do this semester for strength to complete my studies and for God to elucidate
the next steps in my life.&nbsp; I've been in awe of the way God has lead me so far in college, and I am nervous/excited to see
where this journey will lead me next.&nbsp; This could be the most daunting test I've ever been given, uttering the words: ""Here I am.
Send me."", and trusting the man with the plan.

group hangouts and get togethers, this has taken a serious turn.&nbsp; Eddie has been asking me to 
go jogging a lot and now wants to do a movie on Weds. night. I have conversed with my guy
friends, my roomie, and my parents, and they say this is demonstrated interest on his part. 
So now the difficult part, I have to tell/ask him about what he thinks of me as, because I think of
him solely as a friend in comp sci and being someone who's fun to hang out with sometimes.
I don't want to hurt his feelings, but I know it will hurt, since he prob thinks of me in a diff way than I 
view him. My heart just aches everytime I have to do stuff like this. Everyone is telling me it's a good
thing to talk about now, but it doesn't make the tast any easier.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dane seems to think that guys in college who you have no long time established friend base with
are prob interested in you once you start doing stuff one on one. I would have to agree, because 
evidence points to yes. I don't want this to get anymore involved though.&nbsp; I know he's not the type of
guy I would want to marry.&nbsp; He's a good, loyal person.&nbsp; I really want to date someone who is outgoing

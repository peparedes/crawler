"event","So basically today was...i dunno...kinda blah
I stayed up until about 230 talking to Jeff and the coolest artist i know...i was supposed to be doing HW and studying...but big surprise...i was distracting myself  i went to bed and set my alarm for 6 so i could get up and finish some stuff then.  Another huge surprise...i didn't get up until 915
I took a cold shower b/c hot water supply SUX here.  I met Dave at 1030 as per our usual tues thurs routine.  i didn;t go to my 11 class b/c i had to finish the studying i didn't do last night for the test i had at 1...which believe it or not i think i did relaly well considering i didn't even read the book it was on.  Fortunately it was a book with an index! so the questions i had to answer i just looked up and memorized.  YAY for being able to talk your way out of ANYTHING on essay tests!  Went to the comp lab and finished up my portion of a paper i had to do for FFE.
Came back to my room to find it invaded by my room mate and her friends watching a movie on her computer.  OK big dela you might say....but it was a Korean movie....and it was IN korean.  So needless to say i couldn' get any work done b/c i couldn't concentrate with Korean being spoken up the WAZOO and i hate that...especially when she and her friends were talking...b/c i feel like they are tlaking about me
Got to dinner late b/c i lost track of time so i basically said hi and bye to dave.  Saw my favoritest big brother robby for a little while tho.  He's so busy...and so am i...i saw him more when we were at home and we was on his school breaks last year!  (mostly my fault now that i'm thinking about it...)
Had 2 games tonight...which is where the ""i hate caldwell college comes from 
THe girls game was a good game it was really close at some points...but Caldwell won
The guys game was freakin INSANE...they had fans there and thy refused to sit on the side that is typically the ""away"" side.  So they are RIGHT behind me while we're cheering.  They are screamin and yelling and being all kinds of obnoxious, they were just looking for a fight...and GEEZ they almost got one a COUPLE times....a couple of the cheerleaders were ready to pummel them...including myself.  We were winning with about 21 seconds left, but somebody on our team got called for a foul that shouldn't have been called in my opinion...but what do i know...and the other team made both their shots in so it was 65 66 and thats how it ended...Caldwell won...and you know i'm not even upset we lost...its that we lost to them, b/c they were so obnoxious and the way they were acting and tlaking...they deserved to get showed up.  I was yelling so frekain loud tho...and i kicked the bleachers to make a loud noise, only i'm slightly slow and kicked it with my toe...rather than my heel...so that hurt but i was so angry i didn't even care...these people were making me MAD! i was so pumped so i still have a lot of energy...and a slightly lost voice..
Sarah ordered Chinese food and she got me some too :-) That was yummy!!!
i saw rob again...i went to see the ACTS people at the end of their practice...they are doing chapel on monday, i'm SOOO excited!! haha i love it.  Rob tried to smear mime paint all over me...WHILE i was still in my uniform...SILLY BOY!  Then he tried to fight me...it was funny...he lost HAH what a kid, i love him tho!
So now i'm probably going to be up all night doing the hw i keep putting off that really needs to get done...and it needs to get done NOW! Oh well we'll see how well this works out!"

"event","so now i remember why i never keep these things for very long...its because i never write in them!
well i guess i'll start at the beginning of break?
the first couple days were uneventful, mostly just family time
Wednesday the Praise Band i'm on had a concert at St. John's High School (where my brother goes to school) surprisingly i had a lot of fun.  There was a boy in the second row who had me hysterical the whole entire time.  he was waving to me and mouthing ""call me"" and then he made a sign that said ""can i have your number"" and held it up. A teacher came over and tried to take it from him, but before he let her have it, he stood up and showed the guys behind him what it said and pointed to me and the guys all clapped.  Finally the teacher snatched it but the guys thought it was hysterical.  Then he was throwing out a fishing line and ""reeling"" me in.  Everytime i sang by myself the boys screamed.  Dave was LOVING it, apparently he gotta a kick out of me getting so much attention and being like ""haha she's coming home with me""  It was rather amusing i must say, and for once i had a smile on my face the whole time i was singing and i actually got into a little performance mode.  Definately cool.  
We got up at the 1/4 4 thursday morning to drive to maryland to spend a couple days with dave's family.  We got there around 830 and had breakfast with his fam.  Then i went and watched Dave play in the father son football game.  He's so cute, and i loved watching him play, it makes him so happy.  We ate lots of food, there was lots of family...and obviously lots of football (obviously because it is dave i'm dating here...come on now) 
Friday we went to see National Treasure with Dave's dad and Clare.  really good movie, kinda modern day Indiana Jones.  We went to dinner at Dave's Godparents house and then Clare and i went to Sarah's (dave's other sister)apartment, and Amy (dave's brother's girlfriend) and had girly night. Lots of fun is really all i have to say
Saturday Clare and i slept until 1 then dave and i went and got checkers for lunch and watched Newsies b/c i had never seen it and i'm a musical bum.  We went to Dave's uncles for dinner, Rob came, and he's awesome, but thats a given.  We left to go home around 8...dropped Clare and Rob off abour 915 and hit the road around 930.  I didn't sleep for a change, and we talked the whole ride home...until we got lost and i had to read a map....even then we had a lot of fun, but i alwyas have fun when im with my baby :-)
We got home around 230 
Sunday was a lazy day, we watched football and layed around all day. I hurt my back somehow so i was in a lot of pain, so i was laying on the heating pad and stuff.  We watched TV with the fam for awhile and then watched Indiana Jones The Last Crusade
So it was uneventful but fun and i got to spend quality time with my boy!
Guess i'll write later"

"event","So its been another couple days.
This weekend was great.
Had my first basketball game as a cheerleader...and it was good game too! Really close and we won b/c someone scored a 3 pointer with seconds to spare!
Not to mention MY MOMMY AND DADDY SHOWED UP!!!! that was exciting
Then me and sarah and dave justin and dave  went to fridays to eat and then sat in Dave's car and played the question game.  It was actually quite a lot of fun!

Saturday i met dave for lunch and then we went to the mall to make our christmas lists.  Then i went and got ready for another basketball game.
That was an even better game because we were down by about 20 points and by the end of the second half we tied it 76-76 and had to go into over time...THEN WE WON BY 12! it was awesome.  Then dave me and sarah went to get pizza at pizza hut...but they're stupid and close before 11 when they were SUPPOSED to close...which was dumb.  So we drove further down and got dominos and i felt as if i'd be the victim of a drive by shooting where we were...it was...fun...
We came back here and watched Raising Helen...very cute movie

Sunday i got up at 1 and showered and what not.  Dave called and i went down to see him, we watched a bit of the Ravens game *they won 30-10 WOOHOO* and thenw ent to the mall to finish our christmas lists.  The mall was freakin PACKED it was insane we drove around for like 20 mins just trying to find a spot!  We came back here for dinner and then went to Jacobs ladder and then played around on my computer and went to Mickey Ds to get me food cus i was hungry.  Sarah and i had a LOVELY chat late last night it lasted FOREVER and i have no complaints, it was a great time, and i feel all the more closer to her..i relaly like having her to talk to

So now its monday, i'm done with classes i went to Penny to get evaluated...but she told me to come back later..and i can't b/c dave and i are leaving in a little bit, so i went to financial aid and got that stuff sorted out.  Now i'm sitting around waiting for dave to get out of class so we can GO HOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

*Happy 3 days b4 Thanksgiving!*"

"event","sooo today sucked....woke up this morning...and got ready for class...ended up ot going to any of them b/c i didn't feel well.  Had a fight with dave, stormed off when he was about to go to his room....cried...ALOT b/c i thought he was gonna break up with me...meanwhile he was afraid i was gonna break up with him...and believe me that thought NEVER crossed my mind.  His sister Clare called me and i din't answer but she left a message and after i listened to it i felt SOOO much better *thanx Clare!* and then i went in search of dave to patch things up.  i found justin who said dave stayed in the room becuase he didn't feel like eating.  SO i talked to justin which helped a lot and i kinda figured out what was wrong, so he went and got dave for me.  and Dave and i talked and things a now peachy keen and better than ever.  we decided to make some changes and actually follow through this time no matter how hard it is.  and it was just nice to talk to him and know that he wants to do anything he can to help me and help our relationship grow andbe the best it can be.  I've never loved someone this much before!  

Had practice tonight, made a fool out of myself b/c i have no coordination when it comes to cheers and chants...it was funny though...atleast i can laugh at myself.  EXCITING NEWSSSSS penny says i'm almost done with REHABBBBB thats amazing let me just tell you...b/c i HATE it.  i mean i get to spend time with sarah and krista...but its so redundant! but anyway i have to go early tomorrow so Penny can evaluate me and HOPEFULLY completely clear me, and that would be WONDERFUL! 

Dave and i had a nice chat in the car after practice, kinda just about random stuff, and that was really nice we haven't just randomly talked in awhile.  i mean obviously we always talk...but not like that....yeah it was nice.

I had a nice long chat with Clare tonight...which made me very happy, and Sarah rocks my world as usual.....she's sick tho which is yucky...i hope you get better sarah my love!  OH and i talked to my ginifer tonight! i miss her like WOAH i've been relaly homesick for my old friends lately...and she's at the top of that list...and apparently i'm at the top of hers too....so hopeflly we'll see each other soon
and of course theres my twin ""JUST WEAR IT""....hmm i'm glad to see she's as crazy as she was when i left her this summer! Round number 8 maybe? Nyack Style WOOT WOOT hopefully comin up soon!

so hopefully now that things have gotten to the point where i didn't think they could posisbly get worse today...maybe things will start looking up...b/c that would be wonderful...and whole lot easier on my mind!

well i think its bed time...or maybe i should work on some school work...HAH who does that! yeah def bed time...goodnight!"

"event","i'm sitting in the computer lab at school...
as much as i lvoe my school....i'm starting to hate it at the same time
i have so much going on, and i can't do it all by when it needs to be done

stuff with dave is great, as it always is, but i feel like i might be doing something wrong...i dont know what, but he's been weird lately.  I would hate myself forever if i messed things up with him.  he's been the best thing to ever happen to me, and i'd be completely and hopelessly lost without him.  I'm so thankful for him, and most of all his friendship b/c it doens't matter that he's my boyfriend, in all honesty he's probably my best friend over that.  I can tell him anything, i'm completely comfortable around, i know he cares about me in a way no one else ever could.  He's helped me to grow in so many ways, and i'm finally able to say i'm happy with who i am.  Just goes to show you, everything is in God's time, b/c if i hadn't gone through all i did last year...i wouldn't have been ready for all this, i wouldn't be even close to where and who i am now 

anyway still haven't tlaked to my room mate about room changes next semester...but then again Sarah hasn't talked to hers either.  I got so annoyed with my room mate today.  I was vacuuming for room inspections this week, and she was sitting at her desk, just putzing around on her computer, and i'm tryign to get under her desk with the vacuum, and she didn't budge, she didn't even look up.  I'm alwyas the one who cleans the room and she doens't even blink or say thank you or anything.  She never even looks when i come into the room, its like she doens't even know i exist.  Its frustrating...VERY frustrating...i relaly hope sarah and i can room together next semester, it would make things so much better, and having someone to come back and talk to every night would relaly help my stressed-out-ness

i got a letter from my twin today OH HOW I MISS HER!!! we're tryign to come up with a weekend for her to come visit me...we need a twin reunion/vacation from life, and we need it SOON!  Well i'm gonna...i dunno but i'm gonna... haha

i guess ttyl"

"event","well its almost 12 on sunday morning...dave is sleeping...i tried to wakehim up..and apparently that didn't work.  We were supposed to go to my brothers' soccer games...so much for that.  So as he sleeps i'm doing this, and making him fresh brewed iced tea b/c i know he loves it :-)
Its been an interesting weekend, i played mommy majority of the day yesterday, taxiing travis around to soccer practice, making food and doing dishes. Dave and I went to Cabaret night at my high school.  it was GREAT to see everyone.  I had a BLAST but i can't say the same for dave...although he did say he thought it was good.  I knew it wasn't something he'd do for a normal saturday night, so i got him burger king afterwards :-) It was as a thank you for putting up with what i wanted to do even though he didn't really want to...he's so good to me.  then last night we watched Shrek 2 b/c i hadn't seen it yet
Since i seem to be working backwards.  Friday we went for ice-cream at friendly's i was hoping to see Nina but she wasn't there.  Then we watched ever after. oh and my video from my missions trip to mexico like...2 years ago now...probly more.
well this si relaly kind of boring b/c nothing really exciting is going on...
so i guess i'll write later...have a great day everybody!"

"event","well today was the most interesting day i've had in a long time...
After staying up until 3ish with Sarah i woke up around 930 ALMOST decided to just go back to sleep and skip my first class...but i didn't
Wore my cute new outfit today...i must say i like the way i look in it VERY much

Dave and i went out today...had a very interesting time....dont really know what else to say about it besides we had fun...but i always have fun when i'm with him even though we usually do the same thing each and every time *as do most nyackers...go to the mall* 

Had practice tonight, no rehab for my back because Penny wasn't there *YAY*
During team Devo time we celebrated Sarah's birthday *YAY* thatw as exciting, i love my sarah she's so cool...and i dont know what i would do without her!

Had a mini fight with Dave...i said something that i was just teasing about...but it pushed him over the edge, and i hurt him quite a bit. I realized later just how upset i'd be if he'd said that to me, so i apologized...and i apologized whole heartedly...i really love him, and my hurting him, hurt me a lot...i never wanted to hurt him, and i didn't even mean to...but i did, and i was very wrong *and once again...David and i am SO VERY SORRY and i love you* After we fixed everything...he gave me my 2 month anniversary present *he was about 15 minutes early b/c it wasn't the 10th yet* but its absolutely BEAUTIFUL its a silver heart necklace with little diamonds on half of it. SO PRETTY! and as he says *i now have his heart hanging right next to mine every second of every day* 
I gave him his present saturday night. He's been wanting to get his ear pierced....so i did that for him...well i didn't pierce it...that'd be bad..but i got it for him :-) and let me tell you... it looks MIGHTY FINE! 

i have lots of work to do...and i'm celebrating Sarah's birthday tomorrow *i think its now today* b/c she's going home this weekend...and i was supposed to go with her, but i missed to many classes when Grandpa died and from being sick....so i can't afford to miss anymore *i'm gonna miss her*

Well time to...do work..or maybe go to sleep...eh we'll see!"

"event","Sooo i'm running on 2 hours of sleep and a whole lot of chocolate! Ah yes the life of a college student.  
I stayed up all night last night *literally* to study for my make-up New Testament Midterm.  I had to memorize a 200 word passage, 10 references of where things happend in the bible, and 10 places on a map, then there would be 65 multiple choice questions.  Oddly enough, the memorization crap i NAILED piece of cake...the multiple choice however...HAHAHA i'm an idiot...we'll leave it at that.  
I've been having trouble sleeping lately, not a clue why, but when i finally do fall asleep i have weird dreams and wake up in cold sweats.  So i'm breaking out, i'm tired and stressed b/c of all the work i have to do and i dunno, the only thing keeping me going is...well i really don't know.
I had cheerleading practice tonight, i love cheering so much, i just get frustrated that i can't fly yet, and even if i could, i wouldn't be able to b/c i dont have a flying position in the competition anymore b/c i was out b/c of my freaking back.  GEEZ I HATE THAT!  
I went to the mall with dave before practice *i love him*  i got a new backpack a new outfit.  Then we went to Dave's room and watched Will and Grace...that show cracks me up...and so do Dave's room mates... Joel and Dave (yes another one) not to mention Justin ROCK MY WORLD!!!!!!! I like hanging out with them a lot.  Dave's a lucky guy to have such great friends, and even luckier that he gets to room with them.  
Speaking of room mates though, Sarah and i are going to try to room together next semester...that would be a total answer to prayer, i love her like WOAH so that would be relaly nice tobe able to room with her.  Speaking of sarah, we're up making Posters for Midnight Madness *a basketball thing that we cheer at* ...well actually she's sleeping on the table now...we're done making posters, she's supposed to be writing a philosophy paper...i'm spposed to be writing a paper, reading for one of my classes...writing an autobiography and researching for another 2 papers...but none of that is getting done...WOOHOO yay for...late nights of not getting any work done.  Well i suppose i should wake her up now...i have class in the morning..."

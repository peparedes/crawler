I HATE WEARING TAMPONS, YOU KNOW.
especially when it's almost dry. and you can feel the cotton rubbing up on you. and it's all you can do to keep from pulling it out in the middle of your sociology lecture.
christ almighty."

"event","I'm trying to put the moves on Daniel.
At the same time trying not to come off as a conceited nitwit.
I could go on about him. Which is sad, seeing how I've spoken to him for 5, 10 minutes at a time for about three days now. Probably adds up to an hour of communication. But I really could ramble. About his hair. About his glasses. How he should take off his hat so I can see his face. How the long scar on his chest is extremely and strangely sexy. How the wink he gave me gave me chills.
But that would really be too much, because I know I hate when little girls swoon about their current crushes.
And how am I to know this isn't just another relay, a session where I try to rebuild my self esteem at his expense. HM.
Well, Thursday should hurry right along then, in my humble opinion."

"event","The Schlotszky's shut down downtown, so Cory hired a kid named Daniel to work in the deli. 
Daniel is smokin' hot. He's tall and skinny, long blonde hair, SINGLE, 21, & not in Bridgeway! The last three descriptions are especially delightful, don't you know..
But this is most likely just something my mind is doing so as to keep my mind off of <i>him</i>.

I will NEVER win with him. Ever. It's hopeless.

But, yeah. Anyways...I got my period today and am surprisingly not doubling over in pain yet. It snuck up on me around 10 and the only thing that's really sore is my left leg. Normally it's excruciating pain from the waist down..but..yeah..like I said..not yet. I'm just babbling right about now.

Methinks I need to invest in some laxatives today. Be gone of the water weight..meh.."

"event","I guess there's really no point, you see. Because! When my senior year is over, and his semester is over, he will be LEAVING. And I will be STAYING. 
And I can't be trusted. Not when he's in another town, oh no. There's just no way I could stay faithful, even though he has no reason to doubt my loyalty. So we might as well just say <B><I>FUCK IT</i></b>

Right? Fine. Fuck. I'm tired of caring.

"event","Tonight's DH was a lot better than the past few have been. I think the highlight of the episode was when Eva screamed 'son of a bitch!' from inside of the pharmacy's restroom. Hahaha.
I have a cold/sinus infection/tumor that is really pissing me off. I've blown my nose so many times the nost itself as well as the skin underneath is completely raw. Not to mention the constant coughing..OH!Hannah made her bombass enchilladas and they tasted like fucking cardboard.  Rah.!
I plucked my eyebrows so bad today that there's a nice big red sore with a tiny black hair in the center. Good job, girl.
My cousin's high school graduation is on the 20th. Aw, tear. He's growing up. :D
Sigh..I can't wait for next fall. I'll be going to RICE. Yes. RICE. It's as close to Harvard as I'll ever get, I guess."

"event","I heard prom was a nice big let down this year..although I think that's what they say every year. I assume that you just expect a magical evening, because, after all, it's your prom. Tons of girls dream about that day for years, and then discover it's just a dance with lots of hype.
Despite how most kids end up thinking it was nothing special at the end of the day, I couldn't help but feel a little depressed when I was at the Grand March. Everyone looked nice, and I couldn't help but feel left out. It's my own fault, though. I didn't go because I assumed Chris would get jealous and upset..but now that doesn't exactly matter.
Meh'

I've been trying to research scar reduction surgeries whenever I have spare time. I would love to get these hideous self-loathing scars off of my arms, but I don't know how much that kind of thing would cost a girl.
Thinking about that makes the high dolla' pricetag seem worth it all.

...But right now I don't even have enough money to buy a bottle of water.
Go figure."

"event","Sigh...I really need a cigarette. Yummy yummy menthol goodness taking the place of the evil chocolate bunnies that found their way into her grocery basket last night.
Tonight is the time that we work harddddd for the money (so hard for the money!) and pray that midnight comes quickly.
These 3-12 shifts are just <i>killing</i> me. 
Tim McGraw is on the television...which corresponds to the bile in my throat.

I saw a man this morning with those things they give to people with throat cancer. You know. The ones that help the people talk. (Gah, I could have looked up the name...but no. I'll just continue to sound ignorant.) He kept hacking and coughing and scratching himself. The way he carried himself was enough to one squirm. He was one of those people that have the creepy aura. But then. He started to wheeze as his useless larynx made a feeble attempt to do its job. I had to run away...

That really had no point...this class just brings out the rambling, I guess.
Cold in here. But besides the obvious downfall..being cold causes one to shake. To chatter his teeth. To burn calories."

I guess that proves how much it all means to me anymore. Ah, to be 14 & care-free again. le sigh.

"event","<b>He</b> & I have worked things out ;D
We're ""friends in love"" (sounds so queer), but it's 100% better than not having him. It'll be a little trial session leading up to the eventual dating status once again.
I want to go to his sculpture class and laugh in her <i>face</i>. (hahahaha he loves me, not you. yes, that's correct. me. not you. me.) Oh god, that's horrible. But so delightful at the same time...

Arrrrghhhh. I wish I had someone who would sit down and explain a few details of Desperate Housewives to me. It's so frustrating to be lost on some major points of a plot. I guess I'll just have to be in the dark until they put the first season onto DVD (involuntary drool begins...now.)

I hate how my heart has a stabbing pain after every time I purge. Methinks I should lay off the cigarettes..hmm. No.

Feel so out of it tonight ^^"

What a dull, dreary day it's been. Deciding to call in at work was a huge mistake..even though I was immensely upset, methinks the feeling would have crawled into a corner after awhile. 
Majority of my day circled around coffee, cigarettes, and thoughts of <i>him</i>.
I dreamt that I was trying to persuade him to come back with vast amounts of kisses (please please quit thinking about her oh god Holly stop please quit just stop)..he was on top of me, and I was holding onto him to tightly..kissing and crying..
When I awoke his body transformed into my pink hippo.
Ah.
Stupid, stupid thoughts of her (jesus please don't no not another night of this <i>PLEASE</i>.)

Get it out, Holly.
Today's binge foods were turkey and strawberries. I like how turkey comes up rather easily. Made for a quick little pit stop opposed to thirty minutes of hell.
However, the purging did have its downside. I could -see- the seeds still tucked away in the bits of strawberry. I felt like such an animal, not even taking the time to properly chew a food. Disgusting.
Enough self-pity. Move on to better things.
Hmm.
I suppose that forces me to end this particular post.."

"event","Well its one in the morning and I am tired.  I am also hungry, sad, loved, lonely, at peace, healthy, alive, and for all of these things, grateful.  I went and saw The Notebook again with my mom tonight.  Even the second time, it was still moving and touched me deeply.  Someday I hope to experience a love so deep, the kind that is expressed in the movie.  Sometimes I think I like someone, but tell myself that its just foolishness and its not real, but then just when I start to believe that, the person reappears in my life.  The Notebook lets me know that anything is possible when it comes to love and life, it may take years but its possible.  It also makes me wonder why this person keeps reappearing in my life.  Im not saying Im going to marry him or anything...I just like to wonder I guess.
I just cant wait until the day that I fall in love with a boy and he falls in love with me and hopefully we are together forever....if its meant to be that is.  
I feel that over this past year I have dealt with my feelings in positive ways and negative ways.  I have done a good job of not letting myself dwell over a lost relationship with a person of whom I care alot about.  But I have also given time and built the wrong kind of relationship with another person.  Then with some friends I have let myself not get caught up in drama and not let what other people think and say about and to me matter when its not a big deal.  But then I feel like I am not always there for my good friends.  Part of me would like to say ""I'm content with myself and I love the person I am right now"" but the other half says ""I'm not happy to be me because I have done this and do this and say these things and act like this.""  Then I come to the conclusion that Im happy to be me, Im just growing up and maturing everyday and learning new things and also realizing some things I do are just dumb, whether I regret them or not.  The case with me is that I always screw up twice before realizing my mistakes.  Some people its once, others its numerous times, but with me its twice.  I like a guy, he dicks me over I say I regret it then I like him again and then when its over, its all fine and I move on.  I do stupid things say Ill never do it again...couple months later do it again but then Im done and its all fine and I keep my word.  Now that I know myself and that I always screw up twice Im not going to screw things up with a person who was a mistake a year ago and who is now in my life again.  No matter how bad I want to have things like they were a year ago Im not going to.  Im not going to be so quick to make desicions because not thinking about something before hand is what gets me in trouble.  You may not understand what I am talking about if you are reading this, but I do and it feels good to let my thoughts pour out.  Ahhh.....Thats all for now. 
   Love~ me"

"event","Well Well Well..it has been a while, I must say.  Yesterday I had a wonderful day at the beach with my parents, sister, and Haley.  I got some odd tan lines, well last night they were burn lines but overnight they managed to turn themselves into a tan.  I love the beach and the sand dunes.  Haley and I just sat on top of a huge sand dune overlooking Lake Michigan and imagining our life in a year when (hopefully) we live in California for a little bit.  We fell a sleep in the sun and thats when I got my tan line from my capris ha! I can't wait til next summer when I will have no obligation of having to go to school in the fall or having to stay in Michigan.  But until then I have decided to not let time slip by and start living everyday to the fullest with friends and family.  Well I'm out of thoughts for now and I have to go to work. Woohoo! Taker easy ladies and gents."

"event","I went and saw fireworks at the Lansing Mall tonight.....and they were fabulous!!! Haley, Joe D. (who I havent seen in FOREVER) were making such a rucuss (dont know how to spell that word) everytime we saw a cool firework.  We were getting so excited for just fireworks haha! But I would have to say that I am excited to still see fireworks tomorrow too! Fireworks are one of my most favorite things ever! I wish every night I could go outside and just sit in my hammock and watch fireworks! I also got to see my postingthingsinmylivejournal buddy, Simeon, who I forgot to call (sorry) and he was with Ethan YAY!! Afterward goofing around for a while in the parking lot we walked to Meijers because there was going to be a fight, and I was very scared! But it didnt happen which is good....then after that we went to the MOyers, since Mike is the only one there as of right now (bad news ha) but there was no partying or any of that, so I left...haha kidding, I had to leave to come home and sleep, since tomorrow I am leaving to go camping with the fam and Haley until Tuesday when I come home! Then Wednesday its Cedar Point baby!!! Im so excited! Well Im off to bed cuz if I go to sleep I wont feel sick anymore (I ate too many of those Claires or whatever they are called!!) Goodnight
  PS After reading this I realized that I wrote one big long sentence haha

"event","Well Well Well.....Tonight was a night full of laughter, a nice way to send Britt off since her, Haley, and I wont all be together for almost 2 weeks! We went to the 24 hour Beaners for 2 hours and just told stories, remenised on old times, and laughed! We also had two very billigerant drunk guys come up to us and stare right into our faces. It was so random and awkward, and one of the most funniest things that has ever happened to me.  One of them was just starring at Haley for what seemed like 10 minutes, but only about 30 seconds and then like tickled her or something, but said nothing! It was wierd! Then after they left it stirred up a big convo with everyone who was outside at Beaners....whom they all witnessed it. Oh it was hilarious.  So I really want to go see Spiderman, no matter what people say about it and how its not good...cuz I know that I will like it. I am also looking forward to seeing fireworks this weekend, hopefully two nights in a row.  But I dont know if there are fireworks on the 4th of July in Manistee, but I am going to Sharp Park on the 3rd.  Its about time for me to hit the hay. Its always nice going to bed while you are in such a good mood, which is exactly how I feel tonight.  Thanks Britt and Haley for making this a night to remember and being so goofy and fun, and just amaaaazing! You both are wonderful, darlings. Have fun Britt, in Florida!!!! Ummm Haley......have fun sleeping tonight...I'll see ya tomorrow, and the next day....and the next hahaha! Goodnight

Last night I hung out with Jon, Jake, Ethan, Simeon, and Dane and Daneille (who I met for the first time). It was fun considering I havent seen them in forever! We listened to music and went to McDonalds! The people at McDonalds were soooo slow, but the irony of it was that there was no one in the place!!! And Dane and Jake and Jon and I were still there and Jake had to go back to Danes to get his car so after we had already been waiting for about 10 min for his food I left took Jake to Danes house and came back and we still had to wait for about 10 more minutes for his food haha! crazy! Well today was nice..after a month I finally got to see my best friend and one of the best persons in the world, Haley Ann Atkin! Her Melissa and I went to Woodys Oasis and ate some good food and then Haley and I went to her house and she gave me all the goodies she got me in Greece....which I have to say are some pretty good things! Then I came home and had another good meal (yes I know I ate alot today) with my ENTIRE immediate family cuz my brother came home from Texas, but his wife Beth wasnt there :( But after that my day pretty much ended....but tomorrow Haley and Brit and I ARE going to hang out!!! It is my brothers birthday tomorrow YAY! That means another good meal yumm! I wish I was going to Cornerstone...but thats ok cuz lordwilling I am going next year! But I should go Ill save the rest of my thoughts for another time ....like tomorrow haha! Oh I'd like to give a hout out to Simeon...your the jam! Your my new postingthingsinmylivejournal buddy ha!

"event","Yes....I'm bored again so now I am updating this.  I don't feel good though, becuase I have eaten ALOT of food today.  I went to Jessie Wells' open house today and she had a chocolate fountain! It was sooo cool, I felt like I should be in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  I dipped strawberries and sponge cake in it, and I took my cheesecake and stuck it in the fountain and that was delicious!!! After that I went to my Aunt and Uncles' in Brighton with my family for Fathers Day.  So it hasnt been a very exciting day.  But last night was nice.  I went to Braden's open house and then after that Jesse, Riley, Gabe and I went to Ben's open house.  I feel so old because Gabe who is 8 (I think) thought I was 24 years old haha! Ben's open house was nice and relaxing, because everyone was outside and some of the boys were playing guitar and singing and just having a grand ol time.  Then I hung out with Jesse for a while and then came home and crashed! Tomorrow is going to be quite a busy day for me and then I leave Tuesday for Penn., so I wont be doing this thing for a while. I have to pack tomorrow and get alot of things together...that I don't have!  Then at 4 I have to work and then after that is Burt's show! Its gonna be a crazy day! Then when I get home from Penn I might be going to pick Haley up from the airport with Britt! I hope I can make it!!! Well I'm out like a cheetah...C-YA! (that rhymes)!!

"event","Well I am bored...so I thought that I would update my journal, even though I dont even think Britt and Haley read anyways and they are my only ""friends"" haha! 
Last night (Friday) I pretty much sat around the entire day just lounging, watched Battle of Shaker Heights and listened to music.  Then I finally got ready and went to eat at McDonalds with Amy.  That was fun cuz I havent hung out with her or even seen her the whole summer! Then I picked Mike up and we went to see this play our friend Jessie is in.  It was very interesting.  Its something you have to see more than once to understand, cuz its about a skitzofrantic.  But I was impressed! There were two very creepy parts though, and I was a little scared.  But anywho I have to mow my lawn right now then get ready and go to the bank then drop of my movie that of course is late, then go to work.  Then after work I have Braden's and Ben's open houses to go to.  Then after that I'm chillin with the villian, Jesse. Then tomorrow is another hectic day....but Im sure at some point I'll be bored and want to write in this ol thing, so I'll leave that for tomorrow. Long Since Forgotten is a very nice band!

"event","I have had a crazy workin week! I have worked every single day, but at least my paycheck will be nice and big!  Other than working I have had a low key week.  Hung out with a friend I havent hung out with in a year, had some good talks with my girl Britt one night and Jesse the next night at 24 hour Beaners. I rented Matchstick Men, and it was good....but so sad.  I felt so bad for Nicholas Cage :( Anywho tonight Mike and I are going to see our friend Jessie Wells play at the Creo Gallery, so that should be fun and interesting.  I guess its about a person who is a skitzo and the different people inside this persons mind.  Then this weekend there is more open houses, work, and Father's Day...its going to be a looonngg weekend! Then next week I leave for Penn for 6 days, but after I get home HALEY will be home YAY!! It really hasnt been that long that shes been gone, this summer is just flying by. Well Im off to eat some breakfast and watch Battle of Shaker Heights! (its a good movie, everyone should watch it...thanks Haley for introducing it to me, it has changed my life ha!)

"event","I just got home from a wonderful night out in good ol East Lansing with Britt.  We went to Beaners and chatted, and saw some old friends.  While we were leaving the game had just ended and the Pistons had one, so EL was busting and everyone was going crazy. So we decided it would be fun to honk and yell out the window to all the drunk people.  And it was fun! They would all start yelling when we honked...and we didnt even watch the game ha! Anywho....then me and Brittany put our heads together and thought of a name for Haley for the journal.  And I just made Haley an account for this live journal thing and it took me forever to get her a password! For some reason the livejournal security people or whoever runs this spit wouldnt let me use any of the passwords that I wanted to...wierd. But Britt since you are the only one who probably reads this (if YOU even do) you need to talk to me man! But soon the ""britishbroad"" that would be Haleys online journal name ha, will be able to talk also.  Oh I wish I were an oscar meijer weener....actually I just wish I had more friends to read this, but your cool Brittany! I need to go to bed.  Peace out homefry!

I then hung out with my bud Jesse....We went and played putt-putt, which is always a good ol time! I hadnt played in forever! After that we went and played at one of those big wooden parks, and I got so many misquito bites ahh! It sucks...I hate misqitoes.  What are they good for?...they dont help anyone or the environment.  Other than being food for spiders and bats, but Im sure they could find other food! Anywho that was my day! Good night now!

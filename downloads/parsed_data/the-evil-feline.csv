"event","yesterday my mom said something to me that completely broke me down for a good hour and a half and i thought i would never stop crying.  

so i told my mom i got a 29/50 on my first pysch test-that like majorly sucks man, of course it didn't help that i spent so much time working on my essay i neglected pysch and spanish.  just way too much reading.  i knew the first 9 chapters, but i wasn't really there with the last 6 chapters and that was what most of the test was on.  

so i tell my mom, i'm honest with my parents to an extent and i figured they would probably know what to do.  so i told her and the first thing she said to me was ""i think the best thing for you is to quit the UC system and go to junior college"". no no offense to my j.c. friends, but having my mom say this to really broke my confidence and self-esteem.  its as if she doesn't believe that i'm meant to be here, i got into UCI by a fluke of some sort and that i'm not ready for college.  it hurt me pretty bad.  and i was crying and i couldn't believe that she said that.  

she thinks that i spend most of my time watching movies and hanging out with ppl.  she thinks that me playing soccer is getting in the way, when actually soccer takes up 2 hours a week.  i just felt so horrible.  i felt like a failure, and i just broke down.  

i went to talk to doug,my RA, to figure out how to change my option to pass/no pass instead of grade for this class. and he asked why and figured that i didn't do so hot on the mid-term.  i broke down crying as i repeated what my mom said to me. and i was just crying, i couldn't stop.  doug gave me a hug and i just felt like my life was falling apart. 

even jon noticed something was wrong with me, trevor noticed, a lot of ppl noticed.  but then jasmine gave me a add/drop/change card and i kind of brightened up because i knew then if i took it for p/np it can't  harm my gpa if i pass it so lets do that.

ya

oh lol ok so tuesday night, i was standing outside our dorm with jenn waiting for kristen and julie to come downstairs so we could walk to the arc together for our soccer game that night.  my friend trevor got locked out and he was pounding furiously on the door hoping someone would open it and i was laughing really hard.  then i kind of turned my head to see if kristen's light was off or not.  and as i turn, i pass shant's room and i think i see him kissing his friend datevig (a girl).  and i'm like ""whoa!"" cuz everyone says they are really good friends and wouldn't consider dating.  i guess that probably changed.  idk for sure or not.  but then like a minute later he comes out of the dorm with his friend and they walk past us, i guessed they were probably going to the arc to work out.  so then i thought they were long gone, and finally kristen and julie come out.  as we neared the housing office i told kristen ""so i'm glad i don't like shant anymore because i think he and datev are going out"" and it turns out he was like 20-30 feet away from us.  shit, i'm not embarrassed that i said i used to like him, i'm embarrassed i said that and i was kind of in earshot.  as we passed he and his friend looked at us and i was like ""shit i hope he didn't hear it""

lol-me and my big mouth sometimes.

and yesterday i was sitting upstairs talking to trevor, explaining him the whole story of my lovely little breakdown cuz he wanted to know, and shant and allen come up and shant gives me this really weird look and stares at me forawhile and i was like ""shit, me and my big mouth man"".  ya probably thinks we called the RA's on them too after we got mad at them for playing the music so loud and all.

and then i just saw him today as we were walking out to dinner and he was walking back in from throwing his trash (i just knw cuz the door opened like 10 seconds before and so i figured he was throwing out his trash) and he didnt' look at us or anything so hopefully he's just preoccupied and all.

and ya that's my life-other than the huge amount of studying and stuff i'm doing, cept for now cuz i'm looking for a song"

"event","so i'm kinda scared cuz apparently irvine is saying they haven't received my transcript yet.  well they said they haven't received transcripts yet-but in a way that doesn't make sense cuz transcripts shoulda been in by now.  so like i left a message at the school and maybe i have to go to the district and get an official transcript and personally send it to admissions, though i sent in a request for the transcript to be sent like a few days before deadline-so now i'm scared

anybody else get notices from their schools bout transcripts not being in?"

"event","i need to write more.  saw the indian version of E.T. which wuzn't bad, it didn't copy the signature e.t. bike ride which was good but e.t. made me cry a lot more than this one.  i think i got a headache after the 5th song and dance routine popped up but it wuzn't bad as a whole.  got a headache and jelly legs when i walked out of the theater but the crowd wuz hilarious.  when desi's get together anything can happen.  guys hoot and wistle etc and the crazy hrithik fans whistled and screamed, it made the atmosphere funny.  only 6 more days till i'm free of california and eating bout 5 nutella sandwhiches. yay-and maybe my grandparent's have a cd burner so if they do then i dont' need a cd burner all i need is cd's which my mom has a few that an aunty gave her.  so then friday (once the grandparents leave-big screen tv, satellite, dvd player, cable modem, and laptop with hopefully a burner) paradise awaits an inhabitant and that will be me!!!   ya ok now i have to go and somehow wake my mind up-i thought that huge ice cream stuff would do it but i guess it didn't. late"

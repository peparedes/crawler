I'm listening to Seal right now, he has such a pure voice!!!
It's about 6:36 am, ate my toast, and drank my cocoa, and tomorrow i am going to school, so i'm trying to get back into the rythm of things.  This summer has been very interesting. I've experienced a lot, and i was even in a car accident last monday. That was scary, but i thank God that nobody was hurt. Sadly i recently heard about some youngsters i knew of from Fort that all got in a serious car crash near Burton road. Unfortunately they weren't so lucky. weelllll, i guess i will finish up my laundry today, fix my book bag, and then do something really fun like swim or go see a movie. Last day of summer......."

"event","I had a lot of fun yesterday.  In the morning i woke up at 7:30 and got all my chores done so i could have fun later.  I was home all alone too, so it was nice.  Then Brendan came over, and we hung out for a bit, then went to BA Beach in Camas, and went on a really fast and fun boat.  He went intertubing off the back, looked fun, but scary haha.  Later that night we lit off fire works, and watched the lightning! It was really cool looking!  I was very tired at the end of the day."

My butt really hurts right now, sitting on a bike seat for more than 7 hours is too much. Yes, i rode 80 miles on my bike with my dad last saturday. STP is the 15th and 16th, i can do it for sure now! even if i go really slow hahahaa.
so we finally replaced our old compaq computer with a nice new flat screened dell. That was a good investment, it's so much faster, and now i can actually go out and purchase sims 2 and install it on my computer! wooo! 

For the fourth i am going to the fort, and Brendan and i get to go into the Pearson airport area because his family fly their plane there! wooo, i hope the fireworks are really big and pretty this year!!! it's gonna be so fun!

Have fun on the fourth er' body!!!"

oooo that was painful....

then i was planning on going to the starlight parade, but in order to get down there and find parking, you would need to be there around 7 (it started at 8) and yeah, it was too late for that.  So instead i went and saw MI3 with Brendan and two of his buddies in a really fast fun car, and that movie was good, and exciting, kinda corny at some parts but still. I have actually never seen 1 or 2, so i hope i didn't spoil those ones. oh well. Today i am going to my cousin's bridal shower, YAY! SHES GETTING MARRIED. too bad i have to miss the wedding because of my biking trip, but still it's exciting. Then afterwards i am going to my other cousin's birthday party. aaaah i have soo many cousins, i am so fortunate to have all of them, I LOVE MY FAMILY!!!!

"event","Today just started out rough, so i knew it wouldn't fold out very well. Woke up on time and got a shower and got coffee, but my ride couldn't take me to school, and i didn't know that so by the time i find out, i missed the first c-tran and was late to school. I hate beeing late. Theeennn, History class was exceptionally boring today.  Then, i fail my test in chemistry and find out my grade for that class is a D and probably won't move either way.  Well at least i passed haha. Thhhheeen, i sat at an asembly by myself, i guess it was a taste of what next year is gonna be like. My senior friends are leaving, and though i have tried to make friends with juniors, thye all seem to already have their own lil tight nit groups, so i don't really feel welcome, and it's awkward making friends with people sometimes.  So yeah, i know juniors, i just wish they would step down on a more personal level with me, and let me be an actual friend other than just an aquaintence. Or else i'm all by myself next year.....

So yeah, add that depressing thought + Junior project Presentation (which thanks to mr. goodpaster, i am not prepared for) + all my other homework + i'm behind on bike training + my sister might have the norovirus.....all sorts of fun stuff going on today! i love it!!"

oooh well! But i got to see Brendan today for a bit, and that was nice.  Plus i went to my first session of our youth group's small group, and it was fun! Amy is my youth leader, and she is awesome! Her house and her doggies, and her personality really makes hanging out and talking about God really fun!  Tomorrow is my cousin Katie's 17th birthday! and i still need to get her something good! hhhhmmmmm....i think i have a few ideas.  weellll, i am gonna go shave my legs (cuz you really wanted to know that) but yeah, i wanna wear shorts tomorrow after school (unfortunately all my shorts are too short for school) so yeah i save them for after school. Maybe i will wear a skirt to school. idk whatever, i am gonna go bathe!!! wooo! scrub'a'dub dub!"

anyways, went back home, and Bren went back to work.  I pulled weeds a bit (random) and did other random things, then Gina came over, and so did Brendan, and we -gina, went down in to the forest and took a nice walk.  It's really pretty down there right now because it's all green and fresh looking from all that rain we've had.  Later in the evening i studied some chemistry then got kinda frustrated because i know that it doesn't matter how much i study that crap, i am never going to understand it!!!!! I'm also frustrated because i need to get a job (but can't until after i do this crazy bike ride) and i need to get my permit (but don't want to study that dumb book!!!) and i don't know what i want to do as a career ( i have an idea, and i'm going to Clark after i graduate) but i am still worried. Also, i need 20 hours of volunteer work for health class but don't know what to do, and the end of the year is closely approuching! ALSO, i need to start thinking about senior project ideas, and i have absolutely no idea what i'm gonna dooooo!!!! aaaaahhhhh! this is too stressful to think about, i think i just need to go to bed, and get some coffee and check the myspace in the morning and i will feel a lot better.....aaahh goodnight!"

I woke up at around 12:15 with a mean headache, i slept in too much this morning and missed my coffee hour.  So i brewed myself a cup with chocolate in it, and i was cured.  Then i did the usual myspace check, and got dressed.  My hair is very soft and silky today, and i haven't been straightening it very much lately, so since it is straight today, i noticed how long it is! woohoo! but i need to go in and get about an inch trimmed off because the ends are dead.  soo anyways, now i am....ooo wait gotta run! lunch time with NADNERB!!"

"event","I am tired of fake people.....no no no, fake girls.
Guys are cool, most guys i know aren't fake.  Girls really piss me off sometimes, and yes, i know i am one, but i'm not one of those fake kind that distance themselves from you because they don't think you are cool enough to be there friend. I am tired of girls who prefer to just be aquaintences other than real friends, dumb materialistic sissys who don't know how to have fun, and girls who will do the fake ""heeeeyyyyy, how are yoooouuuu???"" just because you happen to have a class together at school, and they are just trying to be nice. I'm not blind, i know how it is, you don't have me fooled. and the gross fake cheesy smile is completely ridiculous!
IS YOUR LIFE A FRICKEN MOVIE?????
THEN QUIT PLAYING A PART!!!
I choose not to be fake nice to people because i prefer not to be a bitch but be a realistic friend.  Now, i'm not saying every girl is like this, but there are waaayy too many who are, and they just need to get over themselves.  I can't stand girls who just about think of what to say before they say it just to sound cool, who reherse their every move and reject others who are simple nice people just cuz they think they are hot stuff.  Not every girl has to look trendy, go to starbucks, and be loud/outgoing.  It's okay to stay at home once and a while, and do something other than party your life away, and quit trying to act so freaking mature alll the time! Your wasting your years to relax and have a little fun.  Take your stunna shades off once in a while, and look at the realness of the world, quit getting lost in your fantasy world.
This entry isn't pin pointed at one person, it's at any girl who is like this, and you know who you are, stop the act, it's dumb."

But yeah, i think it would be something worth while looking into to, and i like art, and i've kinda always wanted to be a teacher....weird since i don't really like school, but i think being a teacher would be purdy fun cuz i'm in charge, and i will have my own class, and get to bond (or not bond) with students.

We saw this really cool Ska band play....gosh dang i love ska so much. it's so fun, and probably really fun to dance and freak out to.  Then they played, and they were really good, haha, it was fun.  We watched others performances, and almost got hit by some hardcoooooore dancers, then we decided to go down to saturday market/cinco de mayo fest with another metal band....aaahhhaaa, saw two people get arrested, ran into druggies and bumbs, and many odd people...aah i &hearts; Portland! yesterday was crazy!

"event","Lets recap on things that i have done this week.

<b>Sunday (Easter)-</b> Slept in till 12, and missed church, and felt bad. I had gone to prom the night before so i was really tired, so i decided to sit in my bed and read the easter story from my Bible, i'm pretty religious. Hung out with Brendan, we went and saw Ice Age 2, The Meltdown! It was really good, and funny, and i love going to see movies with him.

<b>Monday-</b> Went to school. Pretty good day, i just remember being wide awake like the whole school day, and getting a lot done in my classes, actually, this whole week has been like that, and i am very proud of myself. After school, i think i was just hanging out at my house, then Brendan came over and we hung out together.

<b>Tuesday-</b> Went to school again, i was retaking the math section of the WASL in the morning, i hope i get a 3 or 4 this year! Other than that, it was nice outside today, and i was happy.  After school went on a 20 mile bike ride with my dad over across the river and along the water front, and it was very nice and relaxing, cept for the hills haha.  Chilled with Brendan AGAIN! &hearts;

<b>Wednesday-</b> Finished up the math section of the WASL! Yay! now i can't wait to see the results, i think i did better than last year hopefully! Good day, sunny, i was happy, feeling good. Had a partay in Chemistry class. Did a fun lab in there, and they got new lab goggles!!! well more like funky lab glasses! They don't leave lines on your face! and everybody looks cool now instead of goofy! it's so cool! lol. After school, i believe it was sunny again, and i believe i hungout with Brendan again! haha

<b>Thursday-</b> No WASL today! School was pretty average. After school the C-tran broke down, and Gina and i had to walk from a long ways away to get home. it was nice though because we were getting exercise, and it was nice outside too.  We were lightening our hair, and darkening our skin. I was redening my skin though ugh.  So i got home around 3, and my dad was there ready to go on our 50 mile bike ride, but i told him what happened, and that i was way to tired now, so we are doing it friday, which is today!  So then i chilled at home, took a shower, went to Gina's house, danced to crazy music with her, and had fun on myspace. Then we decided to go to Burgerville, and Brendan came with us. We all ate yummy BV food, then went to Brendan's Band Practice, and rocked out a bit and ate meaty pizza!! Later we wanted to go to Dairy Queen, but it was closed, so we all went home, and did our homework like good kids, and went to sleep.

<b>Today!!!-</b> i will tell ya some other time, it's still the morning of today."

"event","So last saturday night, i went to prom with Brendan and a few of his buddies who had dates too. He picked me up at my house, and he looked very handsom! he he! Then we went to his house, met up with the couples, got pictures taken from his happy parents, and left for dinner! We ate at a yummy Italian Place in Portland with a comiedic waiter/entertainer, and may i add he had a lovely italian accent, and a good sense of humor. hahaha. Then we went to the dance! It was at the Tiffany Center in Portland also, and we checked in our shoes and other items, and hit the dance floor!!! and didn't really leave that dance floor until the last song, no joke!! It was really fun, we danced so hard that the top of my dress came un done, and almost dropped but luckily i caught it just in time, and Brendan re clipped it like the gentleman he is!! lol.
Oh yeah, it was Camas's prom, yeah, this Saturday we are going to my prom! woo hooo! But after the prom, we were purty tired from dancing so we went to starbucks, got some smoothies, and headed home around 12:00. and that was good because my mom wanted me home by then cuz i had a cold. And yeah, my cold didn't bug me the whole night, so that was good! But yeah Prom was a Blast, can't wait to do it this weekend too!!!"

I enjoyed making it, it was fun choosing whatever picture you wanted for each one of your buddies, and choosing their display name. I think one of the reasons we humans love myspace so much is because it's a little something we have CONTROL over in our lives. We can choose everything from friends, to music, to design/layout/colors, and we now can even choose what our buddies picture and display name is on our top whatever. it's pretty cool, i think it gives us a sense of......purpose? no, uniqueness (sp?)

I miss Brendan, he is still in Arizona with his family. He returns today around 5 pm. Tonight i am going to Cirque du Solie (sp?) in Portland! The show is called vareki (sp?) which i think it means volcano in french canadian! woot! This is the third time i've gone when they've come to 
p-town. The other shows i went to were called Dralion (Dragon) and Alegria (sunshine, or happiness, or idk). My dad takes me and my sister every time they come!! Yay! Best circus ever!!!"

Anyways then i fell back asleep until 12, i've been doing that lately, and yeah, it sucks, cuz then half your day is already over! oh well. So i finally got up, and guess what the first thing i did??? Myspace Check! for sure! aaannnnnddd nothing! except like one message i think, but whatever! Made myself a turkey/mayo/musterd sandwich and gobbled that up. watched tv i think. took a shower, then started my laundry which led to a chain reaction of cleaning and laundry. and i was very proud of myself. Cleaned the whole family room, and started on the living room too! Did lots of laundry, and it's about 10 06 at night, and i'm still not done! w00t w00t!! So i should get off the computer and go finish my cleaning! I am actually pretty motivated to clean things up around here. My mom is gone, and for some reason every time she leaves, i get this sudden urge to clean so she will be impressed when she gets home.

"event","Lately, i've had soo much to do! School, youth group, biking, dental appointments, homework, other events too. Every morning, i find myself juggeling the thought of staying home  and skipping just to get some good sleep. But i don't, cuz i did that, and i have to go to Saturday school this saturday because i did that... so yeah, i end up going to school, and around 3rd period, i'm almost passed out. then about at the end of fourth i'm feeling pretty good, and once i eat my lunch, i'm wide awake! But i just hate how it takes that long to WAKE Up!  Finally i don't have to ride my bike today, i can rest....well more like do my homework, do this project, and visit with my buds. but still, it's relaxing compared to a 30 mile bike ride. yuck! just ate an egg McMuffin from McDonalds, and yeah, i recently watched supersize me, ugh, oh well, i hardly ever eat there, and when i do, it's just one mcMuffin for me please!"

"event","Yeah, worked them real good today. went on a 30 mile bike ride with my dad....again! went almost to Battle Ground!! ouch! but hey, i feel so accomplished, and it feels good to know that it's good for your body, and that you're fit.  Eating some tasty cough drops right now, yum. i don't even need them haha. So today at school, i was really late to 6th period, in the morning, then 1st period i think i did well on my spanish test which is a shock. 2nd period, we were talking about the 1920's Flappers, and Mr. GP asked if anyone knew how to do the Charleston, and i did because i was in the musical last year, Bye Bye Birdie! so i said it quietly to my neighbor, and he all of a sudden shouts it out, and everyone is trying to get me to do it!! hahaha i didn't do it, but i thought it was really funny. Then at lunch i spilled peach juice on my CROTCH!! and i ran around with my sweatshirt in front for a while, till it dried. today was a funn day.....aaaaahhh! Best Monday i've had in.....years!"

I've already played some Zelda, probably go back to that again later today. I've had plans all weekend, today is a day of rest. I also need to spend some time with God later too, i want to. Gonna read my Bible!!! Yeah, i didn't go to church this morning. i usually only go to church if i'm with my dad.  Yesterday i went on a 20 mile bike ride, Monday is a 30, so is tuesday, but i will probably have to switch that one to wednesday due to another dental appointment! then Thurday is a 40 miler! and Brendan's Birthday!!! Friday is St. Patrick's Day! [PINCH!]
Friday i am leaving with my youth group to this Main Event thing, it's with a bunch of other churches too, and i'm on a dodge ball team!!! i hope we all do really well!! I will probably get pummbled in the head a few times, but that's the fun of it right?"

"event","This last weekend was really fun! Saturday i went on a ten mile bike ride with my dad, and i went to my frien Gina's house too! Then i hung out with an awesome guy, and met somma his friends.  Then on Sunday, i went on a thirty mile bike ride!!! it was insane!! but i felt really accomplished when i finished it. at first it was pretty easy, but towards the end, it seemed like there were more hills, and i was really tired. My dad is a speed demon! Then i got home, and felt totally out of it for a while. so i sat down, and grabbed a granola bar, chomped into it, and ate it. all of a sudden, a chunk of my back lower molar is GONE!! i broke my tooth and swallowed it, but luckly i am scheduled to go to the dentist tuesday anyways so yeah, it happened at the right time. what's weird is it doesn't hurt at all! that's great though! Later i hung out with that awesome guy again!! and we went and saw The Pink Panther. pretty funny. aaahh my weekend was amazing!"

"event","Tomorrow, i am going out at 11:00 am, and riding on my bike, 10 miles again! then Sunday, after church, i am riding 30 miles! It's gonna burn, but it's sooo good for me! I really hope i have fun with certain people this weekend, and go crazy, and enjoy it all in the presence of great people. i love the weekend sooo much, and i know i've stressed that throughout all my journals. i really like this whole internet journal thing, i've never been able to write something down everyday in a regular paper journal, but there is just something fun about getting on the computer and typeing your thoughts. plus you get input from others, and typeing doesn't hurt your hand as much. I hung out with my mom tonight, i love being with my mom once in a while, it's fun to just spend time with her cuz it doesn't happen that often.  We watched a funniest home video marathon, and ate cookies and icecream, then pulled out a bag of bubble gum. that's the only bad thing, when we chill together, we usually break out the junk food, but hey, it just fits! plus i'll be biking it of in the next 2 days anyways!

Then later we warmed up with hot chocolate and went to pizzacatto...really good gourmet pizza and cream soda, and afterwards you get a cute little dinner mint. yum! I love being at my dad's for the weekend, it's pretty fun and thrilling. But you know what's even better? i have no school monday, and i might see WALK THE LINE! i hope it's still in theaters, somebody told me it's in one by target and that's all but idk, i will have to investigate i suppose."

"event","I really like that band, i love the guitar, the tropical flow it's got, and the up beat songs.  I'm rocking out to it right about now.  I skip first period waaaayy too much, yep, i did it again today. but it's weird, when i skip first, i seem to have a way better day. i think it's the extra time i get to get ready in the morning or something. or maybe it's the fact that i don't have to sit there and be humiliated in spanish that morning.  I can't wait until next year, i'm taking no math, and no science! yes! it's a dream come true! But i'm taking CWP, AP English, and art classes, lots of them. i was thinking of drawing or painting, or maybe photo, and design tech.  I want to have an easy load next year so i can spend most of my time working on my senior project. i'm considering taking sports lit next year for english only because i know Mr. Petersen is teaching that, and i love him! he is a good teacher! I hope he teaches another class though other than sports lit....not really my thing. So Myspace is kinda getting boring, idk, i think its 'because i need to get some new pictures or something. I watched  American Idol tonight, and all the people i liked MADE IT! Yay! and it was weird because Simmon was acting insanely nice....huh, i think Simmon is a true nice good ole guy, he can just be a little judgemental, but the truth is, most people can."

I think tomorrow early morning i'm gonna climb my cherry blossom one last time and watch the sun rise.  i might even cry, no joke.  ugh, went to the dentist today too, i have two cavities! yay! i love drills! not! oh well, it happens, there is just way too much sugary adictive foods out there. whatcha gonna du? Welp i just chugged a big mug o coffee, i'll be up a while on myspace and working on my chem now. probably not going to get more than 3 hours of sleep tonight.

Stayed home from school. ya know, i've missed a lot of school lately....especially first period (Spanish). yeah that's probably not good for my GPA or my attendence record. I really like Jack Johnson's new song for the Curious George movie, it's so up beat! jack and the box's fries are really good, but i still think wendy's has the best. So when i was home, i watch the Bourne Identity, and the Fellowship of the Ring ( i've seen it soooooo many times, it's not as thrilling the 20th time) but still, it gave me something to do that didn't hurt my brain too much. then i played zelda, and my friend gina came over and we chatted.  usually we whip around, but my head was not in for that today.  Tomorrow is Valentines day!! and ya know what!!! i don't care if i'm single, cuzzzz i'm not gonna worry about that anymore, whatever happens, happens. ok that's all."

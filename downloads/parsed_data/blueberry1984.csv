"event","Well Sunday was scary.I fainted and fell down 13 stairs.I hit the back of my head and landed in the hospital for two and a half days.It wasn't fun.I was in a neck brace and all.I feel better now but every once in a while i get dizzy.I will be ok.I am very thankful.I think this experience has made me appreciate God even more.Now that this is all over with i think of the poem Footprints.He was definately carrying me.I could of been severely injured.I could have broken bones or cracked my head open.I am very grateful and forever will be.Well i am going to go.Bye

"event","Oh my God.Its been ages since i wrote in here.I have been so busy.Between school work and social events.It's been good but also exhausting.You need that time where you can sit down and relax.I watched tv last night for the first time in a really long time.It was goof to be able to sit down and relax.Lifes been good i cant complain.Could be worse.Yet there is still a bit of emptiness b/c of everything i have been through.I say in a while i should be back fully.Anyways i have got to get going.Babysitting yay.
Bye"

"event","Well the retreat was an experience.I left a lot of stuff that was holding be back behind at esopus.This castle that we stayed in.I feel replenished as if nothing could go wrong at the moment.I left a lot of fears behind and came back with the love for everyone that is important to me.I realize that they are my life and that they mean the world to me.I showed them that.I came home and gave everyone a big hug.I feel so overwhelmed but fulfilled in what i wanted to accomplish on the retreat.I will not let anything get in the way of what i want,that is to be happy.I feel extremely happy.God has touched me in ways no one can believe.I have a mission in life.I think it is going to be to work with kids when i get older and even grown ups.I cant wait to start fulfilling his wishes.Well i am going to go.
Love,
Terry"

"event","Well yesterday was an ok day.My sister came over.I havent hung out with her in a while.I never realized how much i missed her up until now. She is a great person even though at times it seems we dont get along.I was crying last night b/c i am so upset with the guardian she has.The lady does absolutely nothing for her.Where ever my sister goes she's needs to get a ride b/c she cant get off her ass and come get or drop off my sister anywhere.i hate that.I also have been thinking a lot about my grandparents lately.I wonder what it would be like right now if they were both still here and we were still living with them.I dunno."

"event","Friday was a day that i will have in my head for a long time. I went to my BOCES Prom. It was great i danced the whole night. The guy i like was there. His name is James and he is such a sweet heart at least thats how i percieve him. I got to dance with him. The funny part is there was a slow dance and he started dancing with someone and then he saw me just looking at him. He ditched her and came up to me and put his hand out. He wanted me to dance with him. That was the highlight of the evening. I've liked him for a long time and had enough courage to ask him if he would be interested in going out(finally being it's the end of the year).He said no b/c he doesnt have enough time.I could understand that so i wasnt upset. I kept on dancing with him after I asked him. It was great."

"event","Well i was just reading a website from one of my friends. He had moved to Florida a couple of years ago. I really miss him and his mom. They are great people. He has this thing on friendship and how they sometimes turn into love but then he says it could also be lust.I think he was talking about me b/c we had an online relationship for a while. I gave that up b/c he lives in Florida and I live here. We stopped talking for a while b/c i think he got a little upset. I think he thenr ealized that we were good friends and we shouldnt ruin anything. I want to go see him but i cant. I dont have enough money to get down there. I dont know what to do. I really care about him. Well today is my birthday and i turned 17. It was fun. My sister brought in cake for us in school. Us meaning my brother and me we are twins."

"event","Well this is my first time writing here.Its cool.Gee i must sound like an idiot.Anyways today was an ok day.Stressful but ok.I've realized that i really miss my guy friend from florida.He moved away from here about four years ago.We were very close.My brother has been weird Yesterday and today.He's upset about something.Our birthday is monday the 21 of may.The reason i say we is the fact that we are twins.I love him a lot but i cant tell him.I guess its b/c of all we have been through.First losing our mother and father and then recently losing our grandparents who had raised us since we were eleven months.You could say we had it hard but in the end we are turning into better people.We are strong and will always be.I hope he realizes how much i care about him.He is basically all i have left besides my other sister but we don't have as strong of a bond as me and my brother do.School was ok but i see all these couples in the hall and it makes me upset b/c i have no one.No one really knows the real side of me.I want a boyfriend just so i feel as though some guys care about me.I have one that does but i cant go out with him its a long story.Eventually i will go out with him.I'm just waiting.Well i am going to go."

Greatest concert. EVER. <lj-cut text=""All the details under the cut"">

<b>The Drive </b>

Yeah, this one requires a spot for itself. 

So here we are, happily chugging along the interstate when suddenly my husband grimaces, tightens his hold on the steering wheel and announces we've just lost power steering and the engine is heating up. Enter 'oh shit' moment. I want to blame Jaydin, as I happened to be on the phone with him when this happened. 
We glide/pray our way into the parking lot of a Walmart only to realize that it is not open. Yay. So we're in between two states, with a broken car and no handy Walmart. After a slight foray under the car we realize that one of the serpentine belt pulleys has come loose and we barely managed to not loose it along the highway. 
More calls to Jaydin and some panicky 10 minutes of driving with no serpentine belt, we hobble into a repair shop that was miraculously open. By that same miracle (assuming the angels were bored) we find a part. Part repaired for a ridiculously low amount of money, we find ourselves happily on our way 1.5 hours later. Phew. For having lost part of the car, we sure got it easy.

<b>The Hotel</b>

Zip along to the hotel after getting lost, as usual *fist shake* Curse you, Chicago, and your silly, unmarked layouts. Lovely hotel, gigantic, fluffy bed, Cartoon Network. Room Service! Burgers big enough to have their own zip code (which, for what they charged us, I wasn't expecting any less). Indulgence in the form of a Chocolate Cinnamon Warmer (hot chocolate with Triple Sec and Cinnamon Schnapps...most accurate name ever written). 
Line forming outside the concert hall (which is right across the street, heh) we head out there.

<b>The Hall</b>

The Concert Hall is actually a very nice one, we made it there in time to get in line for some merchandise. Apparently our line was the plastic line, since people started falling out of it when they announced they took cash only. Again a spot of luck, we had just enough cash to get...well...everything. T-shirt, program, CD. Whee. Hoarding our newfound riches, we sneak around to our seat. First row balcony, straight in the middle. 
As we're running around, we see the cosplayers. A Red Mage/White Mage couple are posing for pictures. Awesome pimp hat, otherwise kinda bland costumes, but it was amusing. 
The only other cosplay was a young woman dressed as Edea (FFVIII). Amazing cosplay, she had a wonderful arrangement done with her hair. Which meant she did not sit down at any time when music was not being played, as she was being pestered for pictures. Heh. We felt for her.

<b>The Concert</b>

Oh. My. God. They have indeed learned from last time. I'll just recap a few:

<u>Liberi Fatali</u>

Well played, choir, well played. This time they smarted up and gave microphones to the choir. It was beautiful. Also, the video selections that went along with the music were much better this go. 

<u>Don't be Afraid</u> <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=JlWEeCT8ybs"">Linky</a>

If last concert the main impressions were surprised applause, this time it was laughter. The video began with some actual footage from FFVIII, annoying barking dog from Dollet included, and ran, with no music, till a random encounter. At which point the orchestra provided live music for this battle theme. Watching some actual battle footage (including Rinoa falling on her ass, which was greatly amusing) just seemed to make everything so much more fun. 

<u>Memoro de la Stono - Distant Worlds</u> 
<a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=969aHTZYTbg"">Linky</a>

Beautiful. Simply beautiful. Wonderful transition from one to the next, amazing soloist for Distant Worlds. Much, much better than the original version of Distant Worlds that came out earlier. Absolutely amazing. 

<u>Vamo' alla Flamenco</u>

Honestly? They have this one down so well it just gets better and better. The actual game scenes from when the song plays with the fight between Blank and Zidane didn't hurt much at all, either =) more than one of us were hitting our invisible controllers to the tune of ""Press X"" ""Press O"" 
  
<u>To Zanarkand </u> 
<a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=fN6q1q6mynI"">Linky</a>

...it beats the piano version over and leaves it out by technical KO. Gorgeous arrangement for it, the orchestra was magnificent. The video that went along with it included cutscenes from FFX, using The Dance as the last cutscene to go along with the end of the song. I wish I could find this version somewhere.

<u>FFI -II -III Medley </u>

As always, a great arrangment. No surprises for the chocobo theme this time. Some actual 8-bit footage was amusing though. Amazing FFIII DS footage with beautifully rendered cutscenes. <3

<u>Theme of Love</u>

While not one of my favorites (who wants soft and pretty when you can have, say One Winged Angel?), the video that went with this song was 3D rendered scenes that I had never seen before, I'm guessing from a newer version or a soon to come out version. The images alone made it very much worth it.

<u> Aerith's Theme</u>

Always a great one. And as always, no disappointment. Great scenes from FFVII to go with it, mostly 16-bit. I was kind of hoping for some AC imagery.

<u> Opening - Bombing Mission </u> <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=hHF7hkmtpP0"">Linky</a>

That was awesome. The orchestra did such a  great job, pulling an extremely powerful performance to some very true images. Basically got to see the start of FFVII all over again, with live music this time, which just makes it sound all the better.

<u>Love Grows </u> <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=5etHYUjUvjA"">Linky</a>

Best piano playing I have ever heard. Gorgeous. Mostly great amusement at some scenes from the ending of FFVIII, namely Seifer getting pissed off at his fishing pole and people getting kicked off docks. Play it to the end and you'll know what I'm talking about.

<u>Swing de Chocobo</u> <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=4wOxjI5zBo4"">Linky</a>

....GAH. A full song dedicated to chocobos! Dancing chocobos on screen! 8-bit, 16-bit, FFX, FFXI (running through Altepa, no less). Awesome, awesome arrangement. Funnest song in the entire concert.

<u>Opera: ""Maria and Draco""</u> <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=6pSGj4SYTXQ"">Linky1</a> <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=XdjcwhyMQMc"">Linky2</a>

Sweet Jesus that was good. The three opera singers were fantastic, the orchestra surprisingly good on such a long piece. The entire hall cracked up when after a rather intimidating ""Then we duel!"" from one of the singers he proceeded to close his book with the lyrics, square his shoulders and firmly face his 'opponent' singer. Talk about getting into character.
Fantastic song, and great ending to the concert. We had the singers come back on stage for an even longer bow. They deserved it so much.

<u>Encore</u>

""One Winged Angel!"" ""Why do you have to be so predictable?"" 
Hecklers ftw.

It was Terra's Theme. <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=wWi4fE8AFGI"">Linky</a> A magnificently played Terra's Theme that was just fantastic. The best part was, towards the end, seeing the actual ending scenes from FFVI, right along with the credits...for the concert. It made us all cheer. Ingenious, very ingenious. 

<u> ........</u>

<b>ONE WINGED ANGEL</b>

The could not leave us without it. They really could not. Best. Absolutely BEST performance of One Winged Angel I have ever heard. Dear choir: thank you. They blasted through it with more lung power than I have given them credit for. The orchestra did as well, with an amount of volume that was enough to knock us all backwards. AC and FFVII images for video, including a nice fade from the AC Sephiroth to its 16-bit counterpart in the exact same scene. It was a mind-blowing performance which ended with the logo for the concert, Distant Worlds in a soft white and blue hue, in bright fiery flames.

The current medication I'm on is a synthetic derived from the saliva of the Gila Monster (translation: Big Lizard Spit).

It's injected twice a day ( >< ) and thankfully they gave me the Tiny Needle<small>TM</small>, 31G, 5/16"" length. Nothing more intimidating than to hold that needle in one hand, and a chunk of your own stomach in the other and plunge it right in. I think I bored the nurse when they were teaching me by giving her the ""you're expecting me to stick this in myself, areyououtofyourmind?"" look. 

Besides that, I need to make mincemeat of my fingers twice a day to keep a record of my blood sugar readings. For the most part, the only one out of whack is my Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS from now on...on second thought, that reminds me of Fetal Bovine Serum, so maybe not). So far, lizard spit has brought that down by over 20 points in a week. We'll see how it goes from there."

Thankfully, the lizard spit (I'll go into that in detail some other day) is moderating itself in how much it makes me feel like I would like to donate my stomach to science just to get rid of it. And I must admit it seems to be doing its job (albeit slowly, I foresee a dose increase).

"event","Well, I just finished <lj-cut text=""Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones""> PoP: t2T. I picked up a used copy a few days ago (namely, Wednesday). Shame on me, I didn't remember which one came after The Sands of Time, apparently it was Warrior Within. Oops. 

I'm actually pretty fond of The Sands of Time. It's all the acrobatics of Tomb Raider to the power of 10 plus a sarcastic running commentary punctuated with ""Stop talking to yourself!"", which for some reason is extremely funny.

It was kind of sweet to see they brought back the original characters (with weirder clothes and much, much <strike>dirtier</strike>darker than before). T2T is a lot less campy than tSoT, but still kinda fun. 

I will complain, however, that some of the levels were apparently programed by the Sindicate of Retarded Miners of The Deadmines (BlizzardTM), while others were made by the Pwn Your Ass Recreational Group. I swear to God sometimes you just had to go for over 30 minutes of jumps, hops, scotches and daggers slams before reaching a stupid water fountain. And when you have to hang off a wall for 10 minutes just to figure out a timing, you <i>need</i> a water fountain.

Of course, T2T wouldn't have been nearly so interesting without <lj user=""shanshsin""> offering a running commentary while I played the Persian Ninja, and covering his face with his hands when I had to play the Dark Ninja. Oh, and laughing his ass off at me when I crashed my chariot 14 times within 3 minutes. I can't drive worth shit. Stupid horses.

All in all, kinda fun. Love the ending, nice circular there. Still like tSoT much, much better though. Nothing quite beats the campy, although brownie points to the Dark Ninja for amusing corollaries, particularly when the girl was involved. 

""I'm expectantly waiting your answer to that one."" Heh.

I mean, you're pretty damn clever and you know it. You love to flaunt your potential. Heard the word ""arrogant"" lately? How about ""jerk?"" Or perhaps they only say that behind your back. </p><p>

That's right. I know I can say this cause you're not going to cry. You're not exactly the most emotional person. You'd rather spend time with your theoretical questions and abstract theories than with other people. </p><p>

Ever been kissed? Ever even been on a date? Trust me, your inflated ego is a complete turnoff with the opposite sex and I am telling you, you're not that great with relationships as it is. You're never going to be a dude or chick magnet, purely because you're more concerned with yourself than others. Meh. They all hate you already anyway. </p><p>

How about this- ""stubborn?"" Hrm? Heard that lately? All those facts which don't fit your theories must just be wrong, right? I mean, really, the vast amounts of time you spend with your head in the clouds...you're just plain strange.

- Spinach (you should know how much you/others will eat)
- Garlic
- Oil
- Chicken breasts (deboned, amount as needed)
- Bacon
- Butter
- Milk
- Flour
- A big pan for the spinach
- 2 regular sized skillets
- 8x8 or 9x12 glass pan (based on the mount of spinach and chicken above)


* Boil the spinach. If you can't even boil spinach, get out of the kitchen now.
* While the spinach boils, slice garlic in relatively thick slices (at will, I used 3 regular sized ones) and brown slowly in a skillet with some oil (about enough to almost cover the bottom of the skillet).
* Drain spinach well. Dump into garlic oil. Jump back. I guarantee oil will spit at you when the water in the spinach hits it. Sautee at low heat for a few minute till the spinach is well covered in tasty garlic oil. Add salt if you feel the urge for it.
* Use the spinach to line the bottom of the glass pan. Reserve.
* Pan fry the chicken in another skillet (I warned you) till it's nice and golden on both sides. Lay it atop the spinach. Keep reserving it.
* Chop bacon into as big pieces are you're comfortable with. Toss it in the skillet you used to fry the chicken and fry it till it's soft.
* Add 1-2 teaspoons of butter to the skillet with the bacon (depending on how much gravy you're making). Allow it to melt and mix with the bacon fat and the bacon itself.
* Add milk (calculate how much gravy you're making, then add extra, about 1-2 cups). Mix slowly with the fat/butter/bacon. Keep the heat up on the pan around medium low and add salt and pepper to taste.
* Add flour slowly and mix well and constantly. Flour added at will, usually 2-3 teaspoons per 1.5 cups of milk. If your gravy is runny, add more flour, if it's too thick, add more milk. 
* When your gravy is at the right density, use it to cover the chicken and the bed of spinach. Cover evenly.
* Throw the pan with the spinach, chicken and gravy in the oven. I do 20min at 300F (not preheating oven).
* Take pan out. Serve. Make sure to not burn your tongue."

Thick mashed potatoes (as many as you want, instant potatoes are fine)
2 eggs
Bacon (little pieces, fried)
Flour
Patience
Close by water supply


- Mix the mashed potatoes with 1 egg and the bacon. Mix well till smooth.

- Beat one of the eggs in another container.

- Dip your hands in flour. Pinch off some of the mashed potato mixture and roll it in your hand. Roll the little ball into the egg (it'll try to dissolve, don't let it), then roll it well in flour till it's well covered.

- Drop flour'd-egg'd-flour'd ball of potatos into a frying pan with about 1 inch of hot oil. Fry till golden on all sides. Set to drain on a paper towel.

Repeat till you're done with the mashed potatoes or you can't handle having crud on your hands anymore and can no longer see your counter over a layer of flour.

Serve with hot tomato sauce or ketchup at will. Add teeny bit of paprika to tomato sauce for better results.

Ok, so I'm not back, really. I'm just going to introduce you to a new part of my ever tightening schedule. 

It would seem like the VCS (VanaDiel Chocobo Society) is having problems with their own birds, so what better way to fix their problems than to ditch the birds onto someone else! That's right, adventurers are now allowed to raise their own chocobos, granted that they care for them.

So I decided to give it a go and picked out a faintly warm choco egg and personally took it to the South Sandy stables. Guh, it took so long for it to hatch. But it did! And now I have a lovely male chicobo!

<img src=""http://static.flickr.com/59/229290589_edfd17d8c1.jpg"">

See? Oh, and chicobo is what we are all calling the baby chocobos. They're too cute for anything else ^^. I named him AlphaGhost, just cause. He seemed to like it, see?

<img src=""http://static.flickr.com/72/229290582_99d5dd838a.jpg"">

And he is so cute it's not fair:

<img src=""http://static.flickr.com/83/229290587_c035658bf3.jpg"">

So far he eats a few greens and some pastes. He started making a fuss at night, but I think we have that fixed. It was a bit of a scare, as he was asleep for much longer than we had intended him to be >< But he's awake now and behaving like he should. 

I'm even allowed to take him on walks

<img src=""http://static.flickr.com/93/229290583_19ccf96123.jpg"">

My poor Buttwiggler had an upset stomach this morning though. Good thing I grew up some tokopekko grasses myself should the case arised. He should be feeling well shortly.

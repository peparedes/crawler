"event","Lets see i think everything is getting better considering i met some awesome people last night. Anyways i went to boomers yesterday with a bunch of Lely kids after their baseball game. It was a little bit weird and some of them like to talk a lot of shit considering they are one of the worst baseball teams ever. Well i get to pitch against those bastards next time so a few of them will be taking it in the chin! Well tonite I got crunked and went to the pier and 5th ave. It was ok. Tomorrow there is a party in Fort Myers with a lot of people. Sunday there is a huge party in Fort Myers beach that I decided I might go to. Monday there is a double kegger for fourth of July at my friends house so this is gonna be an awesome weekend. 

   I doubt that anyone actually is taking the time to read this but if anyone is i have a question for you. Is 3 years too big of a difference in age to go out with someone? I have no idea. I'll be a senior and this girl is a freshman so i have no idea if that is even legal or not? Anyways im gonna go to sleep gotta get some rest for a lotta crap going on this weekend. Peace Out. Call me if your bored cause Im always hear to talk to anyone that wants to."

"event","Well everyday keeps getting more and more boring. My friends are slowly starting to leave and go off places. Some haven't even talked to me in awhile. *SOME* dont even talk to me anymore and pretend I don't exist. But anyways I dont really care anymore cause Im a senior and only have one more year left of this bull shit. It's not like anyone would even notice if I just didnt wake up tomorrow(exception to a few people). Anyways I guess I just have to try and look to the brightside of things. 
     Well my last few days have been ok. For some reason though I couldn't stop thinking about a certain person that I am trying really hard to not think about. It just kills me sometimes. ""Ohio is for Lovers"" by Hawthorne Heights really hits the spot about how I'm feeling right now for some reason. As much as I try not to think about a few things that happened its hard. ""Because you kill me. You know you do you kill me well"" sorry trying to vent a bit. Christy you are the only one that actually still talks to me about stuff. All the others just dont talk to me anymore. You know who you are out there. Sorry Im feeling extemely emo right now but hopefully it will blow over. 
     Here is one more thing to conclude my entry with. To all you girls, ladies, women. If you've had your chance with me and are no longer with me its too bad cause you'll never find someone like me again. And you will also be crying later in life when im some big shot either in sports or something else and realize you could of been with me. Im way too nice to people and think i need to start changing the way i am. Nice guys finish last bit it would be nice to finish first for once. Peace Out!!!"

"event","Lets see this past week has been a busy one. I got completely trashed, passed out, drawn on by travis and donald, had pictures taken of me, and didn't remember shit. Maybe I need to lay off on the contraband for a little. Anyways Im still waiting for that picture erin and christi. I know it prolly wont happen but that would be hot if I did get a picture. Well my summer is going awesome but there is something missing from it and I havenn't been able to get at what it is yet. I'll figure it out sooner or later. But anyways I guess I have to go to nick's tonite since Travis is leaving and everything. Its not that I dont wanna party with travis for the last time for awhile but I think its just the location its at. Anyways Im not worrying too much about it. Cant change the past so what can you do. Ok and just for the record. CHRISTI YOU ARE MY BESTEST FRIEND!!!! I can pretty much tell you anything I want to and wish I had more people I could talk to about the things I talk to you about. If that makes any sense. Some people I just cant tell certain things but your a different story... Ok well Im out Peace Out!"

"event","Are you aware
Of how much you complicate me
And are you aware
Your words suffocate me
And don't deny
You're talking behind my back to my friends
And don't deny
One day you'll need me, need me 

All my life I've been looking for the answers
To the questions you never asked
And we never planned on this disaster
When will I let it go!

So incomplete
Your stare is cold unlike anything I've ever seen
So incomplete
Your body is tired and falling apart at the seams
I won't deny
I took a part and never wanted you back
Don't deny
One day you'll need me, need me

All my life I've been looking for the answers
To the questions you never asked
and we never planned on this disaster
When will I let it go!"

"event","Well i cant remember much of what happened last night but I just remember it being awesome!!!!!!! I did something I shouldn't of though and drank while taking a few bars. Not a very good decision on my part but it was one of the best feelings in the world. The only bad thing is that I can only remember certain things that happened last night. The only thing I remember was who was there and all of us going to shake and steak at like 1 in the morning. It was awesome. I wasnt alone in this bar taking experience but I cant release the names because I dont think it would be good if you knew! HA HA HA !! All I can do is tell you 4 people took. It really is sweet. But Anyways I'll wont do that again for awhile because I could of done some really stupid shit like yell at the waiter in steak and shake lol.... Woops. According to other people also my blackness came out when the music came on so I cant really say I had a bad time. BELIEVE ME if the black in me comes out I have to be having an awesome time. Anywas Hope everyone had fun this weekend call if you wanna go to the beach or sumthin cause Im bored as usual. PEACE"

"event","Well yesterday was a pretty good day except for the part of getting a knee right in the balls. But anyways had fun and met erin and christi at the beach. Then we went to wendy's and erin and christi decided it would be ok to show some skin and get us kicked out of wendy's. Come on ladies, you have to present yourselves better. lol. But yea the fat black lady Lawfanduh or whatever her name was had to be jealous. I just wish I would have gotten those two girls numbers that were staring at me in wendy's. That usually doesn't happen too often so im gonna have to start taking advantage of when it does. Who knows I could be mistaken and they could of been lesbians staring at erin and christi but Im pretty sure they weren't. Last night was ok too but I dont remember it too much. Just remember dan getting in a fight but dont really remember the details on how it went so. Overall it was a pretty good night but kylee. I'VE MADE MY DECISION AND DONT THINK WE SHOULD BE TALKIN. SORRY! Dont wanna go through any more shit than I already have so. Hey we'll see what happens. I got my fortune read and it said mid july is going to be a great love month for me so we will see what happens considering I have a cruise in mid July. I still have your 5 dollars he he he he he!!!! Anyways Peace Out!!!!!"

"event","Last night was a lot of fun!!!!!!!!! Got a little bit tipsy then went to Ridgeport Pub for teen night. I wasn't breaking out in my black dance moves for some reason though. I guess its cause of a little somethin somethin I did before that I shouldn't of that wasn't drinking. Anyways after that a bunch of people went over to Michelle's and of course I wasn't allowed to fo cause of my damn 1 oclock curfew. I hate my mom sometimes she can be a biatch. But hey all my friends are going on a cruise and im gonna be lonely for a little bit but hey sometimes life sucks. Im feeling a lot better but im not sure why yet? Anyways friends have fun on the cruise Peace out!"

"event","Well I guess im feeling a little better since i've finally found out the truth. Still I don't know why this always happens to me but hey life is life. I think im gonna lay low for awhile or at least til nick leaves for college. I know this is mean but I am really hoping he goes to Sant Fe instead of Edison. Last night was awesome. Went over to Michelle Leiter's and had an awesome time. Christi thank you for standing up for me when nobody else would. My dad asked me why I haven't kicked Nick Dueslers ass yet and I honestly have no idea. Probably cause Im a lover not a fighter. But still for my dad to say that was weird for me. Anyways tonight I am going to the Ridgeport Pub with Michelle and a bunch of other people and its gonna be awesome. Then she's having a party at her house after so I think tonight is going to be another good night. Well This rain is starting to get to me. Im not trying to sound weird or anything but for some reason when I was dating Erin it never rained and we always wanted it to but since she broke up with me its rained so much. I dont know if thats supposed to mean anything but whatever."

"event","Well this is my first time writing in this shit but i don't know nobody really listens to me when I talk anyways. I guess this is a good thing for me to get out what's going on in my life. I don't know the only thing that has been bothering me lately was a little bit of drama that occured on Saturday Night. Im not trying to start any shit but when someone's (best friend) not mentioning any names hints at something and you find out what really happened it's hard to say it didnt when everyone is denying. I want nothing more for Nick to be with Katie and I would never do anything to break anyone up or want to get involved in that.. I dont want to get you involved with any shit with anyone else but it would be nice if i knew the truth. I wish there was some way we could get back together but all I want is for you not to be mad at me and for you to be happy. It's hard to forget certain things but nobody has any idea the pain i've gone through because of stupid little things. Anyways the rest of this day is alright considering i'll be hanging out with my friends later. The boyz have court tomorrow so good luck to all you guys in that. Sorry I cant be there. Do me a favor and kick that cops ass for me. Nursing a really bad sunburn sucks balls. I cant even fall asleep it burns so bad. Anyways hopefully I have a better night than one's in the past."

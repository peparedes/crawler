"event","because i am emo everyone thinks that i am sad all the time. which is the case most of the time but the real reason im emo is because it is just the most freaken coolest thing in the whole world. so im suppose to be drepressed because i am emo but i just cant because i love everything that stands for emo: the tight jeaned boys, the mood hair cuts, being able to dye my hair when and whatever color i like without ppl wonder why im doing it, underground mucis that kicks ass, hating coporate music, going to shows every weekend and then some, smoking(and i dont mean just weed), and everything else that going along with being emo! its just the coolest thing out there. everyone should be emo! i  still hate my life though bc that is what emo ppl do...they hate everthing!
~happy emo kid~"

"event","so i considered ending my life today bc i am emo. But then i realized i should try to hang on for a little longer. So i went to the drag and bought some emo clothes... some fishnet stockings, a white shirt, and tight jeans then i cut off all my hair and dyed my hair black and then bleached it bc i am emo so now im listening to depressing music and wallowing in my self pity."

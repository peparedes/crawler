Yes, yes. We ate junk food. a lot. blah.

My grandparents came for a visit. then I cleaned my room. now I'm here.

I'm listening to Don Henely and like. all these oldies I used to love.

Why are people complaining, about what I write in my journal. If I feel like using my journal to vent, than oh my god. I will. so shut up thanks.

My mom said this thing that I thought was worthy of the journal. but nooooo. cant remember. f-i-g-u-r-e-s. 
And a song wont work at my moms house. SO NOT COOL.
Notice the SO.
Yep.

I have the music my mom hates on now. I love it.

KASONDRA TIFFANY. IT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT. ACCIDENTS HAPPEN. I WILL FINE.

One of the coaches told me to keep it unwrapped when i sleep, but to keep it wrapped when i'm in school

I MADE THE JV TEAM THOUGH. that's what i wanted all along.
I cant wait.
First practice: tomorrow. 3:30. i neeeeed to call me faja but my mom is talking away on the tele.

i made renaisance at school too? high honors? SCARY.
I guess some things are turning around for the better.

I think people need to lay of Jimmy. I mean it. he did NOTHING to you. what happens with us, is OUR business. i may get sad, or upset. but dont spread dumb rumors k thanks. so please just leave him alone.

KRAIG SAID HE'D GO TO ALL MY GAMES CUZ I ROCK! oh yes

I'm feeling a little better.
WE ran A LOT today.
It's ok.

KaSondra played pool with me today.
OH YES.

Yes she is.

Aly is so better calling me later.
That made no sense.
My head hurts.

TODAY: I had a headache and Sparks visited me LAST night.
I went to the nurse during french and she told me to come back. well i got to math. and i was dizzy and i had my head down and Amanda and Sarah got freaked. cuz i was shaking really bad and i told Caswell I thought i'd faint. he walked me to the nurse. She gave me crackers, and water and sent me back to class. Amber made Jimmy move so she could sit behind me. then i find out jimmy thought it was FUNNY how i was sick. ass hole.
THENNNNN. Amber walked me to lunch and held onto my arm. then i didnt eat much since i didnt feel good. Tim walked with me back up to class. I got even dizzier and couldnt sit up in my seat. and i couldnt talk my head hurt so bad. mr. caswell called the nurse and said i need to go down there right away and i needed a wheelchair or something. amber and stephanie started walking me one on each side, then the floor started spinning and i just sat down. i couldnt move. amber ran to get the nurse and steph stayed with me. the nurse showed up, put me in a wheelchair, then brought me to her room. she called my mom and i layed down. she said i shook like a leaf? my mom came. i went home and slept. the nurse told miller i cant tryout tonight. so hopefully i can still play :(

I am so mad at Jimmy. WHY WOULD YOU LAUGH? it's not even funny. that's so stupid.
Grrr. I am like starting to hate him so much.

Must go. OH AND TIM CALLED ME AND GAVE ME THE HOMEWORK SINCE HE IS NICE AND DOESNT LAUGH AT PEOPLE WHEN THEY DONT FEEL WELL. he asked me if i was ok a lot today :) he's a good friend. haha

Here. A little sympathy for you to waste on me
I know you're faking it but that's okay
And I don't want to drag it out
Don't want to bring you down
I never wanted it to end this way

Even if I wanted to
I don't think that I'd get to you
There's nothing I can say to you to make you feel alive again

Here. A little jealousy
I hope you think of me
Hope you wonder where I sleep at night (sleep at night)
Cause I feel like I'm inside out
You got me upside down
Maybe I was holding on too tight

Even if I wanted to 
I don't think that I'd get to you
There's nothing I can say to you to make you feel alive again

So don't just say goodbye to me
Just turn your back away and leave
And if you're lucky I will be your last regret, your only friend

The two of us we dream like one
The two of us, the two of us
The two of us take breath like one
The two of us, the two of us

I guess that this is over now
I guess it's called the falling out
But everyday I'm learning how to make it through this life I'm in

Tsk tsk.
Jeff shall be mad.
EVEN THOUGH HIS MOUSE BUSTED SO HE CANT READ IT :) ha.

Wednesday night: My dad decided it was too cold for me to be outside? uh k.
So I walk into his room to say hello and he goes ""I'M OVER HERE! CAN YOU SEE ME? ARE YOU BLIND YET?"" so I ran and attacked him. that was fun. i havent done that since i was like. 6! Then I went upstairs. and he came up and we talked. and he fixed my heater and i told him his fat butt was in the way of my t.v! well it was....
Then Rach came up and we went to war. hahahaha TICKLE WARS. and pinching, and kicking? and hahahahaaa. I THREW HER OFF MY BED. GO ME. then we ran downstairs. and i slipped across the floor.

Thursday: BEST DAY. hung out with Kristy. got picked up around like 10 and then we went to the MOVIES. and hahahahaha we talked the whole time! it was so fun though. we went to the store and got COOKIE MIX. and went back to kristys house and MADE COOKIES. and found the best website. which i cant tell you. then they brought me home. and here i am!

Friday: kind of boring actually. in school. IT SNOWED. so happy. i hate the cold but i loveeee snow.
After school: KaSondra and I worked things out and i guess there might be another girls night tonight? at my dads? YAY MAN.
That night: JIMMY DECIDED TO COME OVER. even though i'd rather gone to the misfits. pft. just kidding. That was fun. we went outside and he threw a snowball at me! *jaw drops* hahaa. i threw one back :) then we chased my dog. and jimmy slipped and i couldnt stop laughing..KIND OF LIKE IN SCHOOL WHEN PEOPLE FALL OFF BUSES. AND FAKED BEING HURT BECAUSE THEY WERE FINE LAST NIGHT. OH. die.  

on with my story. ok so then we came back. and watched PETER PAN. i think. that may have been before? and we both started falling asleep. i like sleeping on him. hahaha then he cant move.
Then we brought him home.

I GOT MY GLASSES NOW TOOO. jimmy told on me because i took them off and he's mean. <33

LETS SEE. today: MALL? sleeping at my dads? I'M CONFUSED GUYS."

I havent hung out with Kristy since like my birthday so this should be a ton of fun.

Today was ok. Kinda sad untill Kristy told me we're hanging out. then i was like ""OH MY"" and hyper all day.

Steph and i had some fun ""I DARE YOU. TOUCH IT"" ahhahahaha

Then Cayleigh on the bus ""IT VIBRATED ON MY SIDE"" ha. a litttttle loud

OK. I really care about Jimmy. and I hope he knows that. He's one of those SO GOOD things that happened to me. of that made sense?

Jeff EVEN COMMENTED for an update.

Yesterday I went to the eye doctors. I have to wear glasses all the time now for distance.
and reading.

Welll. I also might have this eye disease, Glacouma. my doctor thinks i have it. the nerves in my eyes are messed up and the theres a lot of pressure on my eyes.
I also guess my side vision is off again.
Wow.

I could go blind. Well, last time I knew Glacouma caused blindess too. unless I get the surgery. because I guess there is a surgery? or eye drops too. 1 in 10,000 kids my age get it.
That sucks.

I want Jeff to be there, and he said he would go. but I'm not sure I want him there because in a way, I dont want to be around my best friend if i do have it.

Last night was rough. Went to the mall and bought a coat with KaSondra. that cheered me up. but my whole family is all *iudgdfsG* then we had a snow owl in the back yard.
it was really pretty.

Havent been sleeping well again.
Theres a lot on my mind.
The only things going right are Jimmy, my friends, my best friends, and part of my family.

Pretty upset with my dad, he said he'd call me and he never did. nice to know he cares THAT much.

I think I should go....
I'll write about today, later."

thats ok nikki was sick.

BUT FUCKING PEOPLE.
i dont care anymore, I'll say it.
Stephanie White what the fuck are you doing.

She is going around telling people that I said I can get Jeff Lewis anytime I want? BULLSHIT. I never once said that. I dont even like Jeff like that. I did before for a little but NOT now.
I was kidding about the ""fighting"" over him. I was fucking kidding. you knew that because I was laughing the whole time. oh but I  hear you were serious?

I dont want Jeff to go out with you because you never can pick a fucking guy.
The wole time you were going out with Chris you flirted with other guys and were like ""OH i think I might dumo Chris. I dont know if I like him anymore"" and then you get mad when people make fun of you for giving him head?

You went out with Chris for a month and the whole time you said you wanted to dump him. so fucking retarded. I think Jeff deserves better than you, thats why I dont want you two dating.

Oh and right after you and Chris break up, you what liked SIX fucking guys.
Six.
Not like 2 or 3. but 6.

Then decide on Jeff.

Thats gay. Get mad at me. I could care less anymore. you spread shit thats not fucking true.

Other note, in a way I didnt go to the show, heard some shit from a friendddddd. well read it. haha I feel bad for julie!

What else? going to work tonight to do shit. Jimmy is going to help too. 

Everyone loves my hair now. at first everyone was all ""oh its cute"" then yesterday like, kasondra and kristy were poking my head going ""OH I LIKE THAT PART"" hahaha then i ger home and my sister came over and goes ""I LOVE YOUR HAIR. I WANT THAT COLOR""
Which made me a little mad. no offense. but i want to be different from you. not your little twin.

I'm still thinking about completely dying it.
My mom said ""its your hair"" so I'm going to talk to her about it!

I'm going."

Last night I hung out with Nikki, Cassie, Zack, and James. ran around. stalked some kids! hung out at Zacks with his brotha! and um tim and all them showed up and we dont like them so YEAH! went to my house. saw sarah. went back to zacks after making fun of Andrew being a boy scout.
Cassie went home, I threw water at James, James left. Sarah came over, then everyone went home.
Nikki and I called her daddy and she left.
I made my bed and collapsed. over slept a lot today. oops.

Handed in my project, then colored my math project. Fought with my mom. got grounded. called my cousin, told him he needs to buy me my fish tank that he promised like 5 years ago.
Called my grandpa Wojcik yesterday too. he was happy to hear from me :)

I need to go. I'm upset. and I'm waiting for Kraig to call because he is still my friend and I need to cry somene about why my friends are evil and why I am miserable that Jimmy changed his mind. and Kraig said he was willing to let me vent. which is good. since i REALLY need to vent.
And I cant vent to Jimmy since, he is at church. well will be.

Going to feed my dog. anyone ELSE want to call me and allow me to vent/cry? thank ya."

Jeff laughed his ass off? and KaSondra was trying to make me feel better. I took off with her to go find Kraig. we sat and hung out with them for a bit. then walked to 711, then walked to the movie store. and now i am home.

That's original.

Not going to my daddys tonight.
I feel like shit.
It's my girls birthday! HAPPY BIRTHDAY CASSIE I LOVE YOU.
We're sleeping at my dads tomorrow for a party. hahaha

I'm so hurt. and mad.
and all i can think of is ""how can he say he still cares so much and then pull this shit?"" and not want me to move on or anything, but then. act like i dont matter at all to him?

Thank you's go to... Kraig, Kristy, Nikki, and Katie. oh and Jesse for his help. so that is 5.

Otherwise. I cried. I'm upset. I found out things tonight, everything went wrong.

Then, Jeff lewis came over. He gave me the biggest hug and played pool with Rachel. I needed that very big hug.

Then my mom went and bought me subway.
I didnt finish.

I decided i really dont feel like talking to anyone anymore.
Unless you are one of those 5 people, or KaSondra. or like 3 others but you should know who you are.

I wish Jeff (Sparks) hadnt gone to his dads. I really need him.

I hate fighting with you guys. I mean I'm upset and hurt but I was on the phone with KaSondra and she did point out some shit

I'm sorry I said really mean things and wrote that entry. but if you are/were my best friends, you would know i get REALLY mad. and over-react and shit. and i got rid of that entry and i take back most of it. not the part where i say how i am upset. but the ""iw ish i neever was friends with them"" stuff like that. and how i hate you two.

I dont with that and I dont hate you. I guess I wanted to upset you guys like I was upset. and I wanted you to be hurt cuz you hurt me. because i never said those things, and you started a few lies over them. i never said that though. Nikki you even said you know that I do. so why would i EVER say that?

*Sigh* You dont have to accept my sorry. and I mean, I do want one too. but I am saying sorry for over-reacting. and saying hurtfull things. but you need to look at it from my point of view too.

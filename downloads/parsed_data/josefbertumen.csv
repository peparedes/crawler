"event","Walking in the desert one day, thirsty and tired, I saw a mirage. Jaded by other mirages I had run after in the past, I didn't think anything of it, yet somehow still moved toward it. As I moved closer to the mirage, to my surprise, it was actually an oasis. How can this be? I thought. Is this true? God, give me a sign. I heard the oasis sing. I didn't believe what I heard. Show me another sign. The Phoenix sang. I still didn't believe. Please, one more sign. And then the oasis told me its name; the same name as the first sunrise that broke my heart. Yes, this was the oasis I had been searching for. I should have been happy, but I was poignant, because I realized that like the sunrise, this oasis would only be with me for a moment. Yet despite knowing this, I still decided to stay with the oasis. I would stay with the oasis for as long as it would have me, and when it had grown weary of me, I would move on with my journey, just as the prophets had dictated..."

Dying to understand

Don't you know

Something in your eyes
Captured my soul

I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go

Just cast aside
You don't even know I'm alive
You just walk on by
Don't care to see me cry
And here I am
Still holding on
I can't accept
My world is gone

Everyday of my life
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies
I try and try
To deny that I need you

You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned

You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

With no vivid reason here to find

Around my mind

Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
And with you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know never know

Oh I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my preminition misses
But what I really feel 
My eyes wont let me hide 
Cuz they always start to cry

Lately I've been staring in the mirror
And it's very slowly picking me apart
I've tried to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart

Now just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed

Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got

So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race? A prettier face!
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same 
No way
Think I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me

What a kick just a buddy and me
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
For the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again

Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get
I say that's what you get
That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes
Do not make the man

I'll hold on to my freedom
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now 
I've got to live

I was stitched up by the hands of fate 
Said how you gonna make it on your own 
If luck is a lady? 
Maybe luck is a lady 

I was going down for the third time 
My heart was broken, I was not open to your suggestions 
I had so many questions 
That you just kissed away 

Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise 
The day you walked in and changed my life 
I think it's amazing, 
The way that love can set you free 

So now I walk in the midday sun 
I never thought that my saviour would come 
I think it's amazing 
I think it's amazing 

I think you are amazing 

You tried to save me from myself 
Said 'Darling, kiss as many as you want! 
My love's still available 
And I know you're insatiable' 

We're like victims of the same disease 
Look at your Big Bad Daddy, and your mom 
And your mom...was always acting crazy

Saying please don't let this go

I think you're amazing 

Celebrate the love of the one you're with 

Celebrate, this life with you baby 
I think you should celebrate yeah 
Don't put your love in chains baby 
No no, walk in the midday sun 
I thought I was dreaming 
I think it's amazing 
I think you're amazing

The heaven sent to fulfill my needs

Again, love has knocked me down 
My heart got broken, oh it hurt so bad

I know this is something I gotta do 
But that don't mean I want to 
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just 
I feel like this is coming to an end 
And it's better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you 
I gotta let it burn 

[Verse 1] 
It's gonna burn for me to say this 
But it's comin from my heart 
It's been a long time coming 
But we done been fell apart 
Really wanna work this out 
But I don't think you're gonna change 
I do but you don't 
Think it's best we go our separate ways 
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship 
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby 
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with 
I think that you should let it burn 

[Chorus] 
When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to 
you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to 
Even though this might ruin you 
Let it burn 
Let it burn 
Gotta let it burn 

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you 
Hate the thought of her being with someone else 
But you know that it's over 
We know that it's through 
Let it burn 
Let it burn 
Gotta let it burn 

[Verse 2] 
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to 
Got somebody here but I want you 
Cause the feelin ain't the same 
findin' myself 
Callin' her your name 
Ladies tell me do you understand? 
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain? 
It's the way I feel 
I know I made a mistake 
Now it's too late 
I know she ain't comin back 
What I gotta do now 
To get my shorty back 
Ooo ooo ooo ooooh 
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do 
Without my booo 
You've been gone for too long 
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours 
Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn) 

[Chorus] 
When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to 
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to 
Even though this might ruin you 
Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gon'learn) 
Let it burn (gotta let it burn) 
Gotta let it burn 

Deep down you know its best for yourself but you 
Hate the thought of her being with someone else 
But you know that it's over 
We know that it's through 
Let it burn 
Let it burn 
Gotta let it burn 

[Bridge] 
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on 
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh) 
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on 
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (cry) 

[Breakdown] 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh 
Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?) 
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh 

Too many days, so many hours 
I'm still burnin' till you return 

[Chorus] 
When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to 
but you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to 
Even though this might ruin you 
Let it burn 
Let it burn

An accurate record of what I have been doing the past few months is in my Weekly Activity Report at work, cuz I spend practically all my time at work now.

The air conditioning is nice in the office.

A lot has happened, mostly at work, but work isn't what has gotten me down in recent times.  I've been mising Rolly a lot lately.  We didn't get to spend as much time together as I had hoped we would when he came here in January.  What makes things worse is that it became obvious when he was here that he only wants to be friends, and considering he'll only ever be here a week or two whenever he comes back from Japan, I can completely understand.  Still, it hurts thinking that he can't be the one for me.  Even if he is I'd still have to wait a very long time for him to finally stay here in the Philippines permanently.  He's the first guy I've loved in a really really long time.  I've been trying to get together with other men but it's too hard to get Rolly off of my mind..."

"event","OK.  I wasn't able to finish my last journal entry.  Suffice it to say that not much happened during the holidays but I liked it that way.  I also wasn't able to write my recap of 2003.  I think it's a little bit too late for that but maybe I'll write it up next week because not much is happening next week.  Well, a lot is happening, I have a lot of classes, but no new topics, so I don't have much to prepare for.  

I'm playing ""Dive In The Pool"" on my PC, hence the title of this entry.  I'm sleepy, but I wanna finish downloading the remixed version of ""Are You Ready For Love"" by Elton John before I go to sleep.  I had a facial today for the first time in 6 months or something.  As usual, the pricking tortured me, but thankfully not as much as it usually does.  My face feels clean, and light.  

I hope my pimples clear up before Rolly gets back from Japan.  He's coming back on the 19th.  I had hoped that he would be here for at least a month, but apparently he's going back after a few days.  He told me about it a few days ago.  He's just as upset as I am.  Now I know what it feels like for the wife of an OFW when her husband leaves to work in another country.  It sucks.  I was really upset when I first found out but now I'm kinda stoic about it.  

Me and Rolly were never really officially together.  Still, I kinda like the idea of him being the lover in my life, and I think he likes that too.  He doesn't like the fact that he's only going to come back for a few days only to go back for another 6 months, cuz he's thinks that I won't be able to last another 6 months without fucking someone else.  To be quite honest, I have a bad feeling that he's right.  I'd rather avoid having to sleep with anyone else though, because it would just be too complicated.  Hell, textmates are complicated now, because I no idea how to explan Rolly to the people I chat with.  ""He's my lover, but not quite.""  ""We sort of broke up before he left, but we were never really together.""  If I do sleep with anyone else while he's gone, it can only ever be a one night stand, and I can never speak with that person again.  If I do I would only get attached.  But then again I don't really like the idea of one night stands anymore.  Sleeping with another person also means that I'll have so much difficulty keeping it a secret from Rolly.  I mean, we agreed it would be OK for us to sleep with other people while he's in Japan, but I'd rather not hurt him but letting him know about it.  Likewise I hope he doesn't tell me if he's slept with anyone there.  But as they say, hiding the truth is tantamount to lying.  I don't like lying to him.  And there's more stuff that complicates the issue, and it's too exasperating to write about it all.   Sigh..."

"event","This is the first time that I will be writing my LiveJournal this year.  Happy New Year by the way.  As I usually say, it's been a million years since the last time I wrote here.  I wasn't able to update my journal over the holidays because for the first time in 3 years I actually managed to have a holiday.  Thank God I became a Trainer at work.  I was in Lucena for about 10 days.  That's the longest I've been there since I was unemployed in 2001.  I mostly slept through the vacation, cuz God knows I needed to.  Thankfully the past few days weren't totally uneventful.  I was able to buy a million things for myself and my family (my Mom was able to tax my income successfully), I managed to get out of the house and go to the Kamayan sa Palaisdaan restaurant where the food was absolutely gorgeous, I watched a few good movies, I started an art journal, and I managed to read 2 books.  But like I said, I mostly slept through my vacation.  

I'd like to write a bit more about the books I read, since I really do think that it's quite an accomplishment for me to have been able to read books again.  The first book I read was ""The God Of Small Things"" by Arundhati Roy, a book I have been meaning to read since 1997.  It was a good read.  Not exactly the masterpiece I was anticipating, considering the reviews of my friends who've read it, but it was very graphic, detailed and I could really picture the grotesque details.  Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I weren't so freaking obsessed with nature, magic, and anything remotely thematically connected to the Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings series."

"event","Hey there.  It's been a million years since the last time I wrote something here.  A lot has happened.  I got promoted!  I finally got the Trainer position that I had been applying for.  When Moi was telling me about it I swear I felt like Ms. Universe.  I almost cried.  The transition has been nice, although I'm still trying to remember all the client-specific stuff.  I had no idea that the training department did so much stuff, and I mean that in a positive way.  Apart from actually training reps, we also get to attend seminars outside of the office, for example.  Last Wednesday we attended AIM's Open House.  I swear, it really got me thinking about a lot of things.  I'd love to stusdy under their Masters in Management program because it's all so philosophical and shit, but you need at least 3 years worth of managerial experience to apply.  Crap.  Plus the fact the cost per year is like more than a million pesos, which basically translates to a big ""fuck you"" in terms of my actually being able to study there.  Oh well.  It seems that you can't work and study at the same time while you're there because the classes and studying will take up most of your time, so it's OK.  I spent too much time in college on my studies.  It's time to experience the world.

It was Kathy's wedding last Saturday.  It was loads of fun.  I met Cathy Memps, Meryll, Grace, Liz, and Juris for the first time in a million years.  Marie was there too.  We hoped Jhona would come, but she didn't (again).  I missed all of them.  We chatted for a long time after the reception, and me and Marie slept over at Juris' house.  Major laugh marathon.

I miss Rolly.  I've been thinking about him a lot lately, for some reason.  I called him once, and he said that he wanted to be the godparent of his sister's kid, cuz she just gave birth.  I think that it was really sweet of him to ask that of me.  Then he was telling me the story of how it's getting kinda cold in Japan, and his boss was like asking him why he had a woolly jacket (the one I gave him before he left) when it's fucking hot in Manila, and Rolly said that his koibito (Japanese for lover) gave it to him.  I was touched because all the time we were together here we sorta just called each other friends, and there in Japan he's calling me his koibito.  Since that phone call I've thought about him a lot, and I've decided that I don't mind waiting 3 more months until he gets back before I get laid again.  The thought of him coming back makes me happy.  The only thing I don't like is the way he's always asking if I've slept with someone since he's been gone. I mean, we both agreed that it would be OK for us to sleep with other people while he's gone, but when we talk it's like he's assuming that I have already slept with someone else and that I'm just not telling him about it.  He's just a jealous guy I guess, but it's kinda annoying.  I also think that he's the type of person who pushes people away because he doesn't want to get hurt if they leave him.  Maybe he's testing me.  Whatever it is we'd both be better off if he stopped it.

I've watched Season 2 of Queer As Folk.  I loved every minute of it, but I loved Season 1 more.  I like Justin and Ethan's story.  Ethan's really romantic.  I'd love to meet someone like him, although in Season 3 Ethan turns out to be a jerk.  Rolly's more of a Brian.  I'm a mix of Justin, Michael, and Emmett, although I'm more of an Emmett than anything else.  He's such a fag, and I love him because of that fact.  Hay...  life.  

I hope Mariah's concert here really pushes through this time."

Early this morning some of us from the office went to this bar in the middle of Makati.  We were supposed to be celebrating Allan's birthday (much in advance, because his birthday is on September 30).  However, I don't think anyone mentioned to Allan that that was why we went to the bar, so I'm assuming we're re-scheduling the party for another time.

Can't seem to get the words from my head to the keyboard.  As a result I've been surfing through the websites of several NGOs: United Nations, Greenpeace, Amnesty International, etc.  I've even sent e-mails asking how I can join the organizations.  When I was a teenager in Bahrain I used to recycle, I tried being vegetarian, and was basically pro-environment.  Now I'm a fucking wastrel.  But hey, it's never too late to turn the fuck around.  It's too bad I didn't join the organizations when I still in college.  I would have had more time to be active in Human Rights stuff then.  The problem though with me joining activist groups here is that a lot of them disdain English, which quite frankly is the only language I can speak with fluency.  I joined the Center for Nationalist Studies when I was like in my second year.  Everybody was laughing at me while I was reciting their pledge coz I couldn't pronounce half of the words right.  Anyway.  I still want to get involved somehow in making the world a better place.  I've always dreamed about being this filthy rich millionaire who sets up like a dozen charitable organizations.  I even had a dream once where Princess Diana (this was just after she was killed in a car crash) handed me her crown.  I'm like a billion light years away from being anything even remotely similar to Princess Diana, but I'd like to sorta follow in her footsteps.  I'm very partial to children's and AIDS issues.  I cry easily when I read or hear stories about kids who don't have enough to eat, are abused, or basically don't have the basic stuff needed to make them happy.  AIDS issues are important because I guess, especially being gay, I feel like there's this possibility that I could contract the HIV virus one day.  I made a lot of papers on AIDS in college.  Plus I went through a minor AIDS scare recently, so basically AIDS issues will always be something at the back of my mind.  Oh well.  I hope this pro-activism thing isn't just a phase.  I also hope it's not something I'm just doing because I'm fucking celibate."

Although I've been hearing the song for like a gazillion years on radio I only found out what the complete lyrics are yesterday.  I love the song.  It so describes me (most of the time).  I swear, I'll never be able to get the song out my head ever again.  It's happy, bittersweet, sad, and healing all at the same time.  I know that sounds like some soppy melodrama shit, but fuck you.  I AM soppy and melodramatic.  I like the video for the song too.  All these supermodels from the 90s are lipsynching the lyrics, and it's very dramatic.  I have this fantasy where the ""Queer As Folk"" cast remake the video, they're dancing in Babylon, going around Pittsburgh, and Brian cries during the ""That's what you get"" part of the song.

I used to swear a lot when I was like 13 or whatever.  I stopped when my religion teacher (a nun, Sister Josephine, who everyone swore was Hitler's sister) said something to the effect that if someone used swear words a lot it was an indication that that person had a low IQ or had a very limited vocabulary because they had nothing better to say.  So I became a saint for a while, then started swearing again in my 3rd year of college.  That's when I learned to speak gay lingo.  Gay lingo has a lot nice, flowery swear words that are fun to use.  I think I learned to speak gay lingo even before I could put together a decent sentence in Filipino.  

So anyway.  I have training in an hour.  I'm finally going to get to train a class.  It'll be for the next round of client update training sessions.  I hope it goes well.  I didn't apply for the training position they opened recently, but I may do so in the future.  If I had a choice, ideally I'd be a college professor in UP.  However, they wouldn't be able to pay me enough to support the lifestyle that I have come accustomed to.  So the next best thing is a training position somewhere in the corporate world.

I still haven't been able to update my website.  I hope it doesn't turn out to be like the website of the Speech Department of UP.  The last time they updated their website was in 1999.  I swear, it's so outdated that it's sad.  I was thinking about maybe helping them redesign it or something, but then I realized that if I can't update my own fucking website, what chance in Hell do they have of me being able to update theirs?

At least it's the end of my work week, and in a few hours I'll be on my way to Lucena.  I'll get to sleep lots there.  As usual I'm bringing lots of laundry home.  I so wish we had a working washing machine in Pasig, so I wouldn't be so bogged down with bags going to and from Lucena.  I could probably afford to get one, but I really don't feel like getting one yet.  I have other things to save up for.  I'll probably get one when I have my own place, and it'll be a long time before I move out our house in Pasig.  In order for me to survive I need a TV, a PC with internet, and a stereo system.  Since I can't afford to but all that yet, I stuck with Pasig, but it ain't so bad because I know I'm saving so much by staying there.  My Aunt doesn't obligate me to contribute anything, which is nice.  The only reason I haven't been able to contribute in the past few months is because my Mom got sick, Jelu got sick, and Oliver got hospitalized.  Most of my money has gone to my Mom so she can buy medicines.  They're fine now though, so many next month I can start contributing again.  It's a good thing I haven't had to withdraw money from my savings account yet.  That's something I don't ever want to have to do.  I like the idea of having a passbook with entries only in the deposit column.  I tried that before in college, and I actually managed to succeed for some time, to the point where I actually paid a full semester's tuition with the money I saved up.  Or was it just for one subject?  The point is that paying for my own tuition was good feeling.

Watching the first film made me interested in going back to the province to live somwhere among vineyards (like there are any vineyards here in the Philippines).  It got me interested in getting away from it all, going back to a simple life, stuff like that.  I bought the soundtrack to the films, and they're all melancholic.  I like buying movie soundtracks.  Last year the soundtrack to Croching Tiger Hidden Dragon was, in my opinion, all the rage.  I had a Harry potter phase at the beginning of this year, and I bought the soundtrack to the first film.

I'm worried about Rolly.  I think I wrote something before about my cousin wearing the same perfume.  Well, either my cousin suddenly stopped wearing the perfume, or what I smelled was an apparition of Rolly.  As usual, it's probably just my imagination, but tomorrow I'll call him just to find out how he's doing.  I hope he's fine and not stressing himself out.  He tends to worry a lot, and I'm sure he hasn't completely gotten used to living in Japan.  the last time we talked he wasn't so sure that he'd be able to stay the full 6 months because he was homesick and was completely and utterly tired.  My poor lover."

"event","I'm going through my menstrual cycle.  At least I think I would be, if I were a woman.  Women are probably luckier.  Most have regular periods, and know when they're going to have one.  As a gay guy, I have no idea when my periods will show up, but I know that I'm having one now.  

I've been really emotional lately.  Probably because I haven't been getting enough sleep again.  At least I've been getting at least 6, 7 hours a day, but I really need the full 8 to be happy.  I've been thinking about Rolly a lot, been missing Romi because she's in another team now, and I'm hopelessly and pathetically homesick.  And I'm celibate.  I really need a break.  I'll be in Lucena this weekend.  I hope I get to rest well, and I hope that the people at home aren't fighting or screaming at each other (which they usually are, but they seem to make up quite quickly after).  I'd like to go to a beach somewhere.  Galera would be nice, but I'd like to go somewhere new as well.  Maybe Davao, or the beach in Ilocos near the desert.  God, it's beautiful there.  I used to want to be buried there.  Now... I dunno.  I think that inspite of myself I might actually live quite a long life.  I hope it's a happy one.  Generally speaking I am happy.  Except when I have my period.

I want to go to a bar somewhere and dance.  I miss dancing.  It's been a while since I've been to a club, where the music really pumps you up and you're dancing for hours and hours to the point that you can barely walk the day after.  Ibiza sounds like a nice place -- all the clubs right near a fabulous beach front...  I wish there was a place like that here.  If there is I'd probably spend all my excess cash there (as if I have a lot of excess cash)."

"event","Not much happening at the moment.  I can't wait for this weekend.  Some of my friends from college are inviting me to go out this Saturday, but I really want to go home to Lucena.  I miss the fresh air, and I can only really sleep well in my bed there.  I probably won't do anything exciting, maybe just watch the entire first season of QAF again.  I hope this guy I've been text messaging comes with me.  He's the Jesus-Jesus guy, the one always telling me that God loves me, that Jesus is watching over me, that I should remember to go to Church every Sunday.  He's really sweet, although I'm not religiously, not a Christian, and quite frankly don't see the point in having a religion, but all the same he makes me happy.  It would be nice to spend an entire trip to Lucena with him.  He has family in the nearby town, which is why he has been planning for some time to on the trip with me.  It really depends on how well his tonsils have recovered.  He's been having problems with them lately.  

I've been thinking about Rolly a lot.  I miss him badly.  It doesn't really help that I share a room with my cousin who apparently uses the same perfume as Rolly.  I think about him constantly, and it's I guess the reason why I'm half guilty about trying to hook with other guys.  Rolly and I made it clear that we wouldn't wait for each other.  After all, he wants someone to take care of me while I'm here, and likewise I would like for him to meet someone to make him happy there.  But still, it's been too recent since he was here for me to forget about him that easily.  We weren't ever officially together, but all the same I can't help but feel that to be getting together with someone else is to be betraying Rolly.  Rolly will be back here in 4 months.  What if I'm with someone when he comes back?  What if I like the one I'm with more than I like Rolly?  What if I don't?  Whatever may happen, if I'm with someone, even if it's just a fuck buddy, it'll be so awkward when Rolly comes back.  At the same time, I'm so fucking horny these days, and I'm really itching to get laid, so sooner or later I know I'm going to give in.  Meeting and being with someone else is unavoidable.  If I do meet someone, even if that's what Rolly wants, I'm not going to tell him about it.  I know he'll just get hurt, even if we weren't officially together.  Likewise I don't want him to tell me about it if he meets someone else.  I would rather just die.

I've been chatting with someone who I swear looks exactly like Rolly... from a certain angle.  Out of all the people I've been chatting with recently, he's the one that's been the most persistent, and the one I'm most likely going to get with.  Honestly, I do hope I can find someone else.  I don't want to make him like a substitute for Rolly or something like that.  That wouldn't be fair.

Hay... It's this dilemma that I've been trying to translate into a new entry for my website.  Encrypting your life into poetic symbols is harder than I though it would be.  Maybe that's something else I can work on this weekend."

"event","Hehe... My previous entry was talking about how I would probably not be adding anymore entries in this journal because I have a brand new website.  Well, the website still exists, but I'm kinda finding it hard to have to think of a creative way to encode and encrypt my life.  As usual, I get sparks of inspiration, but I can never really put all of my thoughts down once I'm in front of a computer.  I really need a laptop.  I figure that if I always had a computer in front of me I could crank out the inspiration once it hits me, and I wouldn't have to wait for me to actually get to a computer before I can spill out what's on my mind.

But anyway.  Until I can get enough funds, I'm stuck with the current set up, which isn't all that bad actually.  A lot of stuff has been going on at work, and it's a bit overwhelming.  I'm really, really happy because a lot of SMEs finally got promoted as Team Supervisors, and I'm especially happy for Romi, because she never expected to get the job and in the end two teams actually fought over her.  At the same time, I had absolutely no idea how to console those who didn't get promoted but were deserving of the position nonetheless.  Thankfully, being physically and emotionally there for people is usually enough, so there.  I'm also kinda sad because I won't see Romi that often anymore.  She'll be moving to another team, and it's a really busy one where we probably won't be able to see each other or talk to each other that often.  It'll be a bit lonely at work, although I have lots of other really good friends here.  Still, you can't replace a long-time concubine, and I'm not even going to attempt to.

Last Thursday I bought the first season of Queer As Folk.  I had previously downloaded some of the episodes from season 3 on Kazaa, but I wanted to watch the whole series from the start.  I swear, I so love the show now.  I can totally relate to all of the charaters, all of the situations, and I practically cried my way through most of the episodes.  The sex scenes were really good, but not as good as some of the hard core porn that I've seen, so sex wasn't the main reason I liked the show.  Although at first I thought the acting could be better, I grew to like the actors too.  I just love the show.  The music they play is great too, and the sone I can't get out of my head at the moment is ""Don't Tell Me"" by Madonna.  They played it in the episode where Brian invites Justin to live with him, since he doesn't want Justin to live with his homophobic Dad.  They play the song when Justin creeps into Brian's bed just after Brian tells Justin to sleep in the couch.  It was really sweet how Brian covered Justin with the blankets, even though he turned and faced the other direction after.

That's basically all that's been happening to me.  Can't wait to get season 2 of QAF."

Last weekend I went to San Fernando, Pampanga because it was Marie's birthday.  Her birthday was actually on the 24th, but her party was on the 25th (Saturday).  Juris and Jhona couldn't come, but Awe, Jean, Charm, Ram, and Cheloi were there.  Marie's friends from Bataan were also there, so it was nice to see them again.  As usual, I was mostly semi-conscious during my stay, as I didn't get that much sleep the day before we left for Marie's place.  But hey, at least I was there.  As usual we had a really nice food trip, watched a few movies, and then slept at dawn.  We saw Jet Li's ""Hero"".  The next day Me, Marie and Awe saw ""The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers"".  God I loved that film.  I love the whole trilogy.  I so want to be in Middle Earth..."

This week has sort of been fine though, since I FINALLY got promoted to SME (another YEHEY!).  I wasn't able to go home last week because I was thinking that I might have to go to work last Monday, but I didn't have to afterall.  I basically spent Sunday and Monday walking around malls looking for stuff to buy.  I bought a lot of nice CDs.  The one I've spent a lot of time listening to is Craid David's ""Slicker Than Your Average"".  I'm not really listening to the whole CD.  There's this one track ""Hidden Agenda"" that I swear is so bouncy and yet laid back that I haven't been able to get it out of my mind for days now.  It also reminds me of a beach setting, with the wind blowing gently in your hair and the sun being soft on the eyes...  It triggered a mini-creative spout.  I wrote a paragraph about the feeling, which is the longest coherent piece I 've managed to write in months.

I had a really long call the other day.  It lasted 3 hours and somewhere in the middle I was really getting upset and was on the verge of crying.  The only reason I didn't burst out is because I didn't want the customer to know that he was getting into my head, although I guess he heard in my voice that I was about to break down.  Anyway.  That was a few days ago, the issue has died down, and whatever I told the customer would happen did happen, even though he didn't believe me.

I can't wait to get home!  I brought all my art stuff with me like my coloured pens, my paint set, and my journal.  I'm not sure that I'll actually get a chance to create a piece of art, but at least the effort is there.  More likely than not I'm just going to end up watching a movie.  Speaking of watching movies, ""The Two Towers"" is out now.  I'm sure I'm going to be as mesmerised with it as I was with ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".  I remember after I watched the first film I had dreams that I was in castles placed in sweeping landscapes and all that.  Recently I've had the feeling that I need a more peaceful life somewhere in the forest, or at least in a vineyard between the mountains.  Somewhere where I can really relax and chill out.  For the meantime though, Lucena will have to do.  Hopefully I'll get to go home a lot more frequently.  c"",)"

I met with Juris, Jhona and Marie yesterday.  It was fun, because it was the first time all four of us got together in like 4 or 5 months.  Time sorta stopped still, or at least went really slowly, because we spent most of the time thinking about what we would be doing next.  A lot of the first part was spent talking about business and money matters, and what we would be doing with our careers.  It was a nice alternative to talking about guys and love matters, although you can't really avoid relationship topics when your with your best friends (especially when your best friends are girls).  So anyway.  Jhona is setting up this home-based bakery.  She really doesn't want to be an employee at someone else's company, so she decided to set up her own business.  I'm really happy for her, because it's something that she's been talking about for a while now, and setting up my own business is something that I'd like to do as well.  She's already bought her own oven, has taken classes, and has good prospects.  Juris is a shareholder in her aunt's soap business.  They plan to market their product to Lavandera Ko, which is a semi-known laundry chain here in the Philippines.  Of course law school seems to be going OK as well.  Marie's doing OK teaching at UP San Fernando, and really seems to be enjoying her work at the radio station.

Kidding aside, it really was a nice film, and I liked the thesis behind it.  I spent the entire film thinking that the main character had been brainwashed by the CIA to clear him of his individual identity, but it turns out the guy only had amnesia because of some internal conflict he couldn't resolve.  If I gave away the plot to someone who hasn't watched the film yet, well, too bad.  I loved the action, and Matt Damon really looked delicious there.  And he really looked vulnerable too, which is a quality I like in my guys.

I bought a book, my first since 100 years of solitude.  I bought ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to GETTING RICH"".  Hehe.  Nice book.  By no means does it say that getting rich would be a quick process.  It clearly states the exact opposite.  But it's a nice book that helps you keep focused, although I think it puts too much of a premium on the stock market.  Still, it was a nice wake up call, because some of the stuff it calls ""bad behaviour"" is some of the stuff I do, e.g., spend without thinking, not saving enough, not wanting to delay buying unnecessary items, stuff like that.  Because of that book I've finally decided to start saving, and I alrady have a new budget plan.  I'm not going to elaborate on that here, but the point is that I'm refocused."

Anyway.  I took Marie and Fyke to Lucena for my birthday.  We left Manila on Friday the 16th.  Ram and Jhona were supposed to come with us, but they couldn't.  Ram couldn't make it because he said he had something he had to finish.  Jhona couldn't make it because she was depressed she didn't have a job.  I was kinda upset that Jhona couldn't make it.  It was bad enough that Juris couldn't come because she had midterms at law school, but for Jhona not to come as well was a bit much.  Besides, she sort of said the week before the trip that she would come, and she only cancelled the night before.  At first I really tried my best to persuade Jhona to come, telling her how much she'd enjoy having the wind blow through her hair as we rode on a trolley on the railroad, and how we'd have time to light candles and how she'd be able to either forget about her troubles, or how she could ponder over them amidst nice surroundings.  I also tried persuading her by saying that it's not everyday that one of your best friends turns 21.  At first I thought I was beginning to persuade her, and at least she also gave me some hope, saying that maybe if I called the next day (the day of the trip) maybe she would change her mind.  But she didn't.  That sort of made me teary-eyed, because I really wanted the PDA group to be complete for my birthday.  

But anyway.  The three of us that remained, Marie, Fyke and I, weren't about to let Jhona off that easily.  We decided that before we left Manila we would take one last shot at persuading Jhona.  You see, this wasn't exactly the first time that Jhona had backed out of an engagement at the last minute.  She has this tendency to agree to meet us and then not show up because she ""has a headache"", or because she ""has something to do"".  Anyway, so we went to Jhona's house, which in itself was an adventure because we couldn't really rememeber where she lived.  But we got there, and managed to see her.  She didn't want to see us at first, and we could hear her complaining and shouting inside the house before she came out.  We talked a little, tried realy hard to convince her, but she still wouldn't come.  But I sorta understood why she didn't want to go, cuz in the first place she was genuinely sick, and secondly she was really depressed cuz she didn't have work and had to hand in a resume somewhere.  But it was nice to at least get to see her before leaving.   

So anyway, Me, Fyke and Marie went off to Lucena.  We left the bus station at 2PM, and I was asleep for most of the ride.  I hadn't had any sleep since the day before, obviously because I still had work the night before we left Lucena.  It wasn't much better when we arrived, but at least we managed to sneak in a walk around Site before I finally dozed off.  Marie and Fyke finally met my family.  Thy finally found out why I'm as weird as I am.  They met Ma, and were laughing at all the things she was saying.  They met Oliver, and it was nice how they weren't put off by his asking a lot of out-of-the-blue questions.  For the uninformed, he has mild-autism.  They met the extremely capitalist Jelu, and the pretty Lisa.  And they met Pa, who chatted about careers, and living in the Province.  They also met Ate Baby, but she mostly stayed quiet during our stay there.

Marie and Fyke spent Friday night chatting with each while I wa asleep.  I was kinda worried I'd be a bad host by being groggy and quiet the whole time there, but luckily that didn't happen (except at night, when I was out like a corpse cuz I was so tired).  The next day we went to Bucal on a trolley.  It was the first time I had been on a trolley in a while, and I think it was the first time ever that Marie and Fyke had been on one.  It one of those engine-operated mini-carts on railroads that people use in the provinces to go from one place to another.  It a nice 1/2 hour ride, and luckily it was wasn't raining, unlike in previous days.  It was cloudy though, and I guess that's why the rice fields we passed by weren't as green as I remembered.  When we got to Bucal we took a jeep to the nearby beach.  There were so many trees on the way there that I had difficulty imagining there would be a beach anywhere near.  But there was.  It wasn't exactly a spectacular beach or anything, but it was still a beach, and at least we were near the sea.  It was a kinda boring beach too, because there weren't any rocks, and only a few shells, but it was fun all the same.  We had lunch there, and Marie had a smoke.  I forbade smoking anywhere near my family, since not only do I want them not to know that I smoke, but they're asthmatic.  But since we were in the next town it was OK.  Then we went back to Lucena and bought some stuff in the Salvage area, which is Lucena's version of Baguio's Ukay-Ukay.  

When we went home, and again I fell asleep while Marie and Fyke chatted and sang the night away.  We were going to play billiards, but the billiards hall next door closed early for some reason, which is weird for a Saturday night.  The next day we took a tour of the Saint Ferdinand Cathedral in Lucena and the Basilica in Tayabas, which I took both of them to see because of the art within both of those churches.  Then we lunch and the Kamayan sa Palaisdaan in Lucban, and Mama and Papa entertained and made Marie and Fyke laugh some more.  Then they had to go home, because Marie not only had a class the next day but she also had an exam to prepare for.  

I stayed in Lucena until Wednesday morning.  During the remainder of my stay I tried hard to get back to staying awake at night, but I didn't suceed.  I went through a dozen movies, as usual, but this time I know better than to attempt to enumerate which ones I saw.  Some highlights though include Legally Blonde and Zoolander, which made me miss being an airhead, and the film where Jude Law is a sniper (I forgot the title), which I swear, has the hottest sex scene I've seen in a while, which is a big compliment considering the two of them were not only clothed, but they were under a blanket.  They were that good.  Aside from watching movies I really didn't do much, and neither did the people at home.  It was a long weekend for them, Monday being Quezon day, and Tuesday (my birthday) being Lucena day.  I went home Wednesday morning, but I couldn't get to sleep that day, so I still didn't go to work that night.  I came back to the office Thursday night.

So there.  I had fun and was well rested during my stay in Lucena.  I'm starting to feel that if I don't go back there at least once every two weeks I'd go crazy.  Like I was telling people in the Speech eGroups it's weird how when I'm older I need them more.  I guess it's because in college the Speech family was enough to keep me sane, but of course that family isn't readily there anymore.  Juris, Jhona and Marie, although they're pretty much there when I need them, have their own careers and lives as well.  And with the job that I have and with the fact I work graveyard I pretty much am all alone now.  So unless I went home to Lucena, I really would go crazy.  Besides.  I kinda don't want Jelu and Lisa to grow up without me being there, at least as often as I can make it there."

"event","Hey there!  Nothing new has happened to me really since the last time I wrote.  I can't believe I still haven't finished writing my last entry.  It was something about the movies I saw the last time I went to Lucena.  Well, I've forgotten what the movies were, so forget about that.  What has happened to me since?  Well work has been OK.  I don't really have any complaints.  I mean, I still don't like the work in general, but at least I'm not going crazy like I used to be before.  I had a really cool facial a week ago where they ran electric currents through my face.  I swear, it was so amazing my face was like having orgasms.  I could feel the current going down my spine, and it's a good thing the attendant didn't get harrassed because I had my mouth open and I think I was moaning.  Jhona was there, and she actually thought I was in pain, when really I was in extreme pleasure.  I'm going on Vacation Leave tomorrow, and will be on leave for the next five days.  It's my birthday next week!  I'll be 21.  Me, Jhona, Marie, Fyke, and hopefully Ram as well will be going to Lucena Friday morning, after my shift ends.  I'll be in Lucena until Tuesday, my birthday, and the rest of them will probably leave on Sunday.  I've been longing to go back home for a while now.  I realized that I can't go for long periods without going to Lucena.  It's sort of like my placebo for mental illness - placebo, because in the first place I obviously don't really have mental illness... (?)"

"event","Hey there!  I've just realized that I'm starting this new entry even though my previous two entries haven't been completed.  Anyway.  I'm happier back at VeriSign.  It definitely isn't as tense as it was when I first left.  I've been a lot more relaxed, had more time to email people, browse through the internet, chill out.  Basically there's nothing left to say about work, so...

I watched a million movies last Saturday when I went home to Lucena.  Here's a brief recap:

(1)  Kiss of the Dragon: A nice kung-fu movie.  I saw it on the bus going to Lucena, and I actually liked the dramatic part of the movie more than the action.  It was a dark, tragic hero meets prostitute meets mafia type of story.

"event","Hey there!  It's been a while since I last updated my journal.  Heck, it seems as though I haven't even finished writing my previous entry.  You have to forgive me for that.  I've been really stressed at work lately.  Then again, when haven't I been stressed?  I don't want to have to explain the whole ordeal, but basically I was doing really crap in Expedia, so I decided to move back to VeriSign.  I swear, I was feeling really bad because my performance was really crap.  I was taking too much time during calls, and it was taking me too long to adjust and to memorize all the details and procedures.  Somehow I never really could take being a new rep again.  I've been back at VeriSign since last Monday.  I'm not sure if moving back was a good idea, or if it was a wise career move.  If I stayed in Expedia there would have been a chance for me to enter the travel industry.  What we do at Expedia is basically what most travel agencies do.  I could have also found work at airlines after Expedia, since in a way I'm kind of familiar with their systems.  I guess with VeriSign there would be a chance for me to enter the IT industry, but I'm not really sure if I'm qualified enough or if I have a good enough educational background to really make it big.  But the point is that I'm back already, and it's kinda moot to think about what might have happened if I stayed.  I just hope that in the long run moving back would turn out to have been the best thing to do.  So far it's been OK.  There's really not as much stress in VeriSign as there was when I left.  When we were in 'rehabilitaion' or update training, I really appreciated how Barbs, our trainor, went to lengths to get us VeriSign mousepads.  It was like she really wanted to make sure we were happy about moving back, and it was like they wanted to reassure us that we were welcome in coming back."

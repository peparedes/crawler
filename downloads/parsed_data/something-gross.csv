<P>So yeah, things havent been so good lately. Except I did well on my Spanish test. So that's gotta count for something. Lot's of stuff has just been lame. So it should look into.. stopping. Yeah. </P>
<P>But today I went to see the Incredables with my dad. It was pretty good. The like mini cartoon thing in the begining with the naked sheep made me laugh so hard and I don't even know why. </P>
<P>Later it was, quote unquote, girls night out. Dee, Amy, Laura, Karissa, Jenny, and I all hung out. I liked that. I love those girls and being with them made me forget about shitty things. So hoorah for friends! </P>
<P>Today is Alex's birthday and I must give him his present.&nbsp;Yay for Alex's birthday!</P>
<P>I'm so tierd. I just want to sleep until wednesday. That would be so wonderful, yes. After tuesday it's gunna be a new tri! that means 1/3 done with the year, skol! </P>

"event","<P>This ice cream tastes mega old. grotesque. It doesn't feel like a Sunday, it feels like a .. not Sunday. I guess this weekend just went by mondo fast. I kinda wish weekdays could go by mondo fast, but of course not.</P>
<P>Yeah so on Wednesday was the Green Day concert with Jenny and Joy. It was the most fun ever. I was so close to Billie Joe it wasn't even funny. I was like... 3 feet closer and I could have raped him so easy. It was cool.</P>
<P>I was really tired on thursday so&nbsp;I didnt go to school. I was planning on like, not going to 2nd and 3rd and comming during 5th but I ended up sleeping way too late. It seemed pointless. </P>
<P>Then on Friday right after school I hung out with Stevo for a while, then he left and I went to St. Peter to visit Lindsay. I had such a fun time up at her collage. Her friends are the coolest and everything rocked. I should just skip the next two years of high school and go to Gustavus now. Or just live there on weekends. So much fuuun. And the food rocks there too.</P>
<P>Saturday Lindsay brought me home at like seven. I called Karissa and went over to Jenny's with her. We watched Eurotrip. It's the funniest movie ever cause this little kid pretends to be hitler, good entertainment. I was really tierd so&nbsp;I left and went to bed.</P>
<P>Today I went to the Mall de America with Alex. funfun. Sept I didn't buy anything. Moomers told me not to buy anything though since I bought a bunch of stuff in Mankato. But you don't gotta buy shit to have fun. So it's all good, woo for loitering!</P>
<P>In like a week we have all those days off and I'm so excited. I got sick of getting up early and going to school like.. after the 1st week. Lame. So yay for Thanksgiving. </P>

<P>Friday Dee came home with me. I love her. We talked about so much stuff, then we ate a bunch of stuff, and.. stuff. Then we went over to Jenny Beckmans house with KD, Ellie, Dana, and Whitney. It was a lot of fun. We all got along really well, it was awesome. I've known those people for a while, but i never really <EM>got</EM> to know them. They're really cool, so it rocked.</P>
<P>So tierd.. I could die.</P>
<P>On Saturday I went to target and got a really kickass ninja turtle watch. Heck yes. Then I went to Alex's and watched the Nightmare before Christmas. Good quality movieness.</P>
<P>It was on Tv again today. Sept I was uber sleepy so..&nbsp;I fell asleep and I still don't know how santa got away from the boogie man.</P>
<P>I hung out with Stevo today and got a sexy cracker jack box ring. Those are the best kind cause.. they just are. All cracker goodness plus a prize. Right on.</P>
<P>Holy monk I dont understand this history stuff either. School&nbsp;can suck a duck. Dude though steven drew me this lovely green bird. It is deliciously pretty. </P>

I said kay. She's my social studies friend. Cause those jerky boys piss me off and I would be extremly INVERT-ISH WITHOUT AMY. Amy. right on.</P>
<P>Anyway.. so this week has been pretty good. yes. I hung out with Stevo a lot and he is absolutly amazing &lt;3 skol! Me and Alex still talk and stuff too, so that is delicious. He's uber cool and so if he ever stops talking to me I'll totally go ninja on him. like whoa. <A href=""http://www.whiteninjacomics.com/comics/sohungry.shtml"">UN NINJA!</A> like that. totally.</P>
<P>Today Kenny was gone from school. Holy nun I know, I was incomplete. But he said I could be his band's biggest fan, I was honored. Woo for Kennu! We have ourselves a few children.. One of them is BORG. It's the only one I remmeber.</P>
<P>Sam is going to Costa Rica for school. I'm so jealous.&nbsp;Dude, I'd totally go if it was like.. free. And I didn't have to know spanish... and stuff. We're gunna bake.. a cake.</P>
<P>So tomorrow! DEE RIDES MY BUS HOME. Then we might hang out with CK. *drool* pahahahahahha rad! dee is a good kid. I didnt think she liked me today. u.u But I love her way much!</P>
<P>Saturday I'm playing with Stufoo! I miss el floffy way much. :( Last year i always saw her and now it's like never. It's lame how many people I'll see in the hall occasionally and think.. dude, why do i never see your beautifulness? Crazy.</P>

<P>pahahahahaha. laugh. -.- </P>
<P>Yeah, anyway. On monday there was that test thing. Sam and me were all sitting on our stools.. with numb butts, complaining. It was exciting. Then we saw some of the musical and people told us not to do drugs. But, no classes so it was worth the lameness. </P>
<P>Tuesday I stayed home from school cause i wasn't feeling school-savy. People were pissing me off. </P>
<P>Wednesday I went to school, took that jury thing that turned out not to be hard. psh. Then after school Stevo came over. He's such a rad kid. Krissa and KD came by for a bit with some cheese curds too. </P>
<P>Thursday at guitar! I GOT A MONDO STICKER, then it got killed. I was mad pissed. I did well, I was pretty proud of myself. </P>
<P>Friday was yesterday. Lots of people dressed up at school. Dee and I were girlscouts. People thought it was a cool idea. It was fun. There was this one guy that was a big gift and on the outside it said ""To: women From: god"" it was so cool. Then after school I went to Alex's and hung out there then Fro came over and we went to see Saw. It was pretty good. I hadn't seen Alex for like, two weeks. crazy. </P>

<P>That was yesterday, and.. as far back as&nbsp;I can remember.</P>
<P>Today Lindsay and I went out to a Mongolian place with some of her friends from collage. It was fun, then we went to MOA to get her a dress. It's really pretty. I tried on this hot pink.. like.. flamango dancer dress, I felt like prom queen :)&nbsp; I rock.</P>
<P>Yeah so this was pointless, sept... tomorrow, no classes! so that rocks hard.

They wern't aware that if they did infact take Arney, they would have had to deal with my wrath. -.-;;; just kidding :) But uh yeah. I hung out with THE Jenny Decalo and Krissy on Thurdsay. And we saw that movie Ladder 49 er something. It was so sad, dude, I hate how in movies they introduce the charactor, and you really like the guy cause he's a good kid, then.. they kill him in an uncalled for and cruel way. Lame! Yeah, then on friday Dee and I got our Halloween stuff n shit. Then she came over for a bit, then we dropped her off and went to&nbsp;sexy walmart. My parents needed some curtains and needed my sheer, fashonable,&nbsp;expert opinion. Yeaaaaah, I know. But then Amy and I went up tp the shoppes and met Karissa and Jenny up there. And went to eat and saw Katie and Ashely. Sexaaaay. Then Amy Krissy and Jenny came over and slept over at mi casa. Hardcore fun. We got some movies, they wern't scary though. One was like, Candyman... and the other one was 28 Days Later. My sister told me that that movie had scared the shit outta her. I didn't find it scary. Shes a dipthong and doesnt come home when she should. Psh, crazy, lame, homosexual sister. :) Anyway, yes. Those girls rock my world. And Amy's not THAT smelly. ^.^ Then Krissa and Jenny got picked up, and me and my pappy dropped off Amy, then he took me to Alex's. We watched Freddy Vs. Jason. which is way weird cause I think when Amy Kris Jenny and I were looked for movies, we like.. considered it.. or.. Friday the 13th. ...or something. Yeah I don't rememeber. Maybe it wasn't that weird after all. -.- Uh, but yes. Alex &lt;3 He's leaving me for CHURCH CAMP. I know, that.. is.. low. =.=&nbsp; So yeah that's lame cause I don't get to see him as much as I think I rightfully deserve o.O cause, he's a homo.. But I've learned to accept that. 8-)&nbsp; and with him all not here,&nbsp;thats gunna&nbsp;make the whole&nbsp;seeing him thing kinda hard. pshsfjfesf . but oh well, he's still a good kid. But guys, after that I went to McDonalds. I was dissapointed. The cheese on my cheeseburger kids meal, wasn't melted.. and they forgot my toy. That's so uncool. I'd sue, but McDonalds already gets sued for everything, I'd feel bad because they provide me with my yummy food, but sense this latest incedent, I think they get what they deserve. And if that means they get it by morbidly obese people sueing them for being fat, then so be it. Whoa I just realized that almost everytime I say Karissa's name.. I spell it differently. Poor girl, she has no concrete identity. I wonder how she feels about that. She's a strong girl, she'll cope. She went in my room and taped her school picture all around. Crazy albino. I'm so damn tired though. bah. And next weeks a lame 3 day week, man we just shouldn't have to go. Moomers made brownies and I'm gunna go check that shit out. peace</P>

She asked me to make something for her cult and I was like uh no -.- Yep, then I got to hang out with Alex &lt;3 so that rocked. I eventually migrated home and ate some.. food. I drove through a drive thru today, holy nun it was.. excrutiating. Then I went shopping with Jenny! I spend a whole like, 5 dollars, on insense and a.. bead thing for a necklace Ill&nbsp; hemp someday. But, there was this bug, attacking my FACE. Fucking whoa. Jenny saw it, it was like ...it was a life changing expirience. Dudes I saw her new car thingerrrr. It looks like Lindie's flying booger. o.o her car..&nbsp;sexy times pi. and right now! I'm&nbsp;talking with Karissa which&nbsp;I havent done really much lately. Her beautifullness is missed. And whoa, guys. I think Cookie is going through kitty-puberty cause her voice is like 80 times lower. Insted of all.. mew. shes like. o.O ....mow? shuttup, you'd have to hear it to believe it. I totally gave B a fruitloop today, it took her like 15 minutes to finally swallow it. Crazy.</P>

"event","<P>Hell yes, soo I finally went back to school. I was kinda behind so it sucked. I had to take this demon math test. Fricker I did so badly. But yeah, Amy left like halfway through the day cause she's a gaylord. So I didn't have anyone to defend me in social studies :( it was horrible. ROAR! Socail studies is the worst without Amy cause of all the faggots. -.- seriously, it pisses me off way too much. BUT DEE RODE MY BUS HOME! It made my week, even though it was just for an english project. But we got to talk about rocking things so woo! Then I had to go to Pep Band yeaaaaah. Sarah made me a pretty scarf though ! Which rocked cause I was cold times a million. <FONT size=4>LINDSAY CAME HOME TODAY</FONT> and I got to see her for a whole 6 minutes before she left to go to Rick's house and never return. What.. a fag. It was like, she come's home.. calls me fatty.. tells me I'm a loser.. and leaves. It's so beautiful. &lt;3 I'm going to visit her soonly though, but she's all busy with her cult thing. lame!&nbsp;WHOA STUFOO AND KZ JUST CALLED ME. sweet! I love them way much, they're at some church retreat and Steven is way jealous cause kz loves me more u.u SEX! Hum, and no I didn't write that thing in my old live journal thing. It was not me, I'm thinking it might have been.. directed tword me? but it was hard to tell cause of the rhyming, it distracted me from the words. It was like rapping in my head. All ghetto. Kinda like Dee, she's so ghetto. But I have a popsicle calling my name, and it is not afraid to melt. Peace!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ps! kenny you rock. and, people are lame but I still think you're way rad &lt;3)</P>

"event","<P>Today was pretty lame. School was proabably my favorite part of the whole damn day. Which is wierd cause that never happens. It was just crazy. This girl&nbsp;I know, she lives down the street from me, she was like, one of my best friends (..i only had like 2 friends. but shuttup) until&nbsp;I was like ten maybe? And I'd go over to her house, and we'd play dress up and get picked on by her older brother. (he was the one who told me santa claus wasnt real...&nbsp;I cried for like 2 hours o.o)&nbsp;Then her mom would feel bad and make us cookies. And like, her house felt just as much like my house. Her mom was like, someone&nbsp;I wanted to be like when&nbsp;I grew up. She made kick ass banana bread, and that rocked too. And I got off the bus today and my mom told me she had just died of cancer. It was like whoa, and I still don't understand, why people who have the most to live for, get such the shitty end of the stick. It's so stupid and it pisses me off. Yeah so I just came home and slept cause I started not feeling to well. I was supposed to babysit but my mom called it off cause i was still sleeping. Then I talked to Dee for a while on the phone. She was afraid she was loosing me as her best friend! And dude, Dee you're the best ever, and I'ma tell you AGIAN that... you rock my world more then anyone!&nbsp;And you know things about me and if I ever loose you ... you could blackmail me!! X.X &lt;3&nbsp; woo! then KZ called me. And we talked about stuff (she's a very wise girl I'll have you all know.) She's going to have to ride my bus hope a.s.a.p. or else I will hold her at ferrit-point until she hangs out with me. (my mom cooked part of her birthday present.. lame!!) And yes. oo Steven was being nice today. &lt;3 He's a good kid! Deep..deepdeepdeepdeepdeep down inside that it ^.^&nbsp; but yeah. uhm... that's about it. I have this biology test tomorrow that I should probably keep reveiwing for, so I'm going to do that! yes.&nbsp; buhbye muffins</P>

My other journal died, so today when Jenny was here I made this one. I hung out with her today cause she's cool. And even though she goes to osseo (...I know, osseo, they can't even win a football game ^.^  and just cause I wasn't there doesn't mean i can't rub that in. But it sounded like a good time.) she still hangs out with me. Sept she stole my sweatshirt and, she should give it back. <3 It's her birthday tomorrow though O.O so whoa. I'm so excited for the concert AHHHHH. But it's so far away. lame. And I made KD a cake today. She's such a rad kid.

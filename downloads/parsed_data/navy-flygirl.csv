"event","Ok, so today was a good day, other than the fact that my mommy is hurt.....but yeah.  I volunteered to be a color repair model for the salon that cuts my hair, meaning that i gave up about 3 hours of my time and they dyed my hair for free.  It looks really really good, not much different until you look at the roots really closely, other than that, it just looks smoother and more even.  I love it, I get to go back in a couple of weeks when they do the next one and they are going to try to see if they can get it to be darker than what it is, should be interesting to see what happens.

other than that, today was highly uneventful, which is a good thing.  the most interesting thing that happened other than the color experiment is the fact that we had someone in putting a new fixture in at the bookstore.  They were making a sliding bar for the banners that are in the front window.  when it came time to put the banners up on the new sliding bar, jesse told me that i should go ahead and put the silver rods up to hold the sign, i was like, ok, but im short.....he thought that i would be able to reach it any way, ha.....i had the guy doing the instilation laughing at me, syndey from urban laughing and jesse....yippie skippy......so i had to use the step stool and put my side up and jesse just sort of stood there and reached it (jesse is about 8 inches taller than i am)

That was the extent of my day, other than getting bitched at for wanting more hours at the store and telling my parents that I would have to go to patrick henry to get them, but ya know, im the one paying for the gas and im the one paying for the repairs to my car, so what does it matter to them.  I just dont get it, i guess its another feeble attempt at controling my every move, im surprised that they havent asked me for an account of everytime that i go to the bathroom, meanwhile Amanda is in the final stages of finishing college applications and the begining stages of finding out who really wants her to go there.  she is hoping for W&L, but thats a really really far shot, so we will see.  I hope that she goes to VCU or something close, but i swear, if that girl gets a fucking car, its on.  

Anyway, I guess i should be going to bed seeing as how i have to work in the morning.....yippie skippy...."

Lets just say there has been a lot of drama and I dont really understand why so many of our sister nULLs are so damn vindictive.  OH well...there is definately a possibility that I am pregnant.  Gotta love that.  I am 10 days late as of today and still nothing.  I will have a blood test done on the 4th of March so thats when I will know for sure.  Granted I have taken 3 pregnancy tests, but I still shouldnt be this late.  I have been gaining a little bit of weight, and my boobs are definately a size bigger than what they were a month ago.  

This whole idea of sister nULL unity is sorta bull shit.  Oh well.  I am definately over it.  Tomorrow is switch day here...that means for 24 hours, I will be a nULL again.  I think that I can handle that, it wont be too bad.  I dont however like the idea of them getting the privledge of using the curvy stairs.  They dont deserve rites.  They havent earned it yet.  But I guess I dont have much of a say in it.  I am going to sign off here for a while, Andy was supposed to call me back so that we could work on math, but he hasnt, so I think I am just going to go back to my room and take a nap, oh wait, I have to go and talk to ""the man.""  eh.

I just hope that the roads arent too bad cause I have to go to VMI for class tomorrow.  This weekend was pretty good, got to see a guy from home.  We had a leadership seminar and then band practice today, ick.  It was awesome to walk out of band practice and see that it was snowing.  Went to Wally World and got some stuff for the room and got a new pair of sneakers.  They were only 13 bucks, but I think that they feel better than the other ones that I had, these have a higher arch in them and I think that it might help alleviate some of my feet problems.

"event","I am sitting here in the Library trying to study for my final.  I have come to the conclusion that since it is 1015, I will take my final in the afternoon period.  Once again, this is a demonstration of how easily distracted my little mind is.  I dont know who might be reading this but I am sure that it is entertaining.

I am also considering an offer that was given to me by one of my best friends.  I am not going to say what this offer was right now, but it might just change my life forever, and for the best.  I do however dread the day that I have to tell my parents what I am considering.  Oh well, they will get over it or die angry.  I finally have all of my notecards done for this exam so the hardest part is now memorizing all of the info i put on the 50 some odd notecards.  Oy vey.  When will I ever get out of this hell hole that we love to call Baldwin.

Things with the Honor Council situation turned out ok, nothing is going on my permanent record and I learned how partial the system is.  I was told the only reason that the matter wasnt persued further was because the grade I received didnt warrant further investigation.  So if you fail a test here at Baldwin and were accused of cheating, dont worry, you failed, you couldnt have cheated.  Personally I feel that the entire Honor system here at Baldwin is bullshit and is very one sided.  The only opportunity I had to prove that I was innocent, was denied to me by my teacher and nothing is being done about it.  I guess that is what happens around here.

I think that I better get back to studying...although it isnt what, or who, I would like to be doing right now (you know who you are).  I will write more later when I finally take my exam.  See Ya!!"

I miss you, miss you so bad

I hope you can hear me
I remember it clearly

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same
Ooooh

Nah nah la la la nah nah

I didn't get around to kiss you
Goodbye on the hand
I wish that I could see you again
I know that I can't

Oooooh
I hope you can hear me cause I remember it clearly

I'm gonna miss it, but will come & stay one weekend a month with ashley & Elizabeth & make road trips there occasionally.  I hope you all study hard & achieve everything in your wildest dreams.

"event","So, along with reading Harry Potter 5, things are pretty hectic in M-boro.  I love it there.  I am pretty sure that I have gotten a job.  I'm expecting a call tomorrow.  I will be working for Clinique.  Pretty cool huh???  I get to play with make-up all day long & get it all for low prices.  I really think I am gonna like it.  I went to Nashville to a little cafe called ""The Muse or Kung-Foo Coffee"" & saw a band from FL play called ""the defining moment"".  They were awesome & they dedicated a song to Zach, Jonathon, & I because we all hung out before the show.  That's the second time I've been in Nashville.  It's only 20 mins away from me so it is very convient.  I keep looking for faces I know, but so far.. no luck.  I miss you guys.  I promise to visit when school is in & I am off work.  I hate that I missed Shelby's wedding.  Those pics of her were breautiful.  
  So last night Zach & I layed awake & were discussed why I hate him talking to his ex- & telling her that he loves her (even if he says it's in a friendship way) till about 3 in the morning.  It ended up with him saying that he is not gonna let me hurt his feelings over this again & that he will never discuss it again & I will have to get over it.  He says it's cause I don't really know how much he loves me... & you know what... sometimes I don't.  I've been hurt so much in these past couple of years that I have lost trust in guys.  When someone says that they love me it is so hard to believe.  I always feel I'm not good enough.  So, I started back on my anti-depressants to try & even out my moods.  How can I learn to trust again?   *sigh*  Oh well, life is like an ocean tide.. build a bridge & get over it.  

I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just want to sit and stare at you
I don't want to talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just want to cry in front of you
I don't want to talk about it
Cuz I'm in Love With you"

Today my parents told me that they can't see Zach & I getting married because we are too good of friends.  Oh well... I don't care because I don't plan on thinking about it for years from now.  Sure I want to get married, but not like I used to be obesessed with it.  Now it's more like... when it happends I will be over-joyed, but for now... who cares.  I'm gonna live it up.  I have another kidney infection.  Yea for me.. no .. not really.. but I am glad that I have finally moved in.  I am homve to visit tonight & use the internet because we don't have it yet.

His computer desk is not comfortable at all.  We are gonna watch Hellboy tonight after he buys it on his way home from work.  We saw it in theater & it was great.  Not too much is going on here.  Just been reading Harry Potter & trying to get everything ready for Friday's move.  Hope everyone is doing well.

Go check it out on www.purevolume.com/tobinsbridge & let him know what you think.  He's been feeling kinna blah since he lost his drummer.  They are looking for one when we get to the Boro.  Have any ideas?  Anyways...  I'm about to watch Bro. Bear.  I'm going to go to Cornersville on Sat & see Meg.

"event","This is my favorite song by a band no has heard of....Ozma.. but they rock 

i've been cheating on you ever since we broke up 
i've been dreaming about you ever since i woke up 
and now my hearing's disappearing ever since you spoke up 

i'll devise a plot to break your heart 
think up a plan that i'll never carry out 
what's wrong with you? 
tell me now, what should i do? 

don't let me down 
i couldn't take much more of your love 
don't call me up 
i'm so sick and tired of being down 

so i asked you to the show but i knew you wouldn't show up 
you came to my birthday party just to tell me i should grow up 
and then i see another girl and i think i'm gonna throw up 

so i'll devise a plan to nuke your man 
dirty tricks to come back and take command 
i'll win your hand 
we'll hijack a plane and we're never going to land 

don't let me down 
i couldn't take much more of your love 
don't call me up 
i'm so sick and tired of being down 



The lyrics are so crazy that i they you all will enjoy them.  Catch ya later
(if you wanna check out the band go to ozmaonline.com)  Thanks"

I dreamed that Zach was cheating on me with this chunky blonde girl & I smasked her with pillows & other house hold things.  Then i go running away & it turns winter & I find my self standing in front of Scott Solomon.  He's wearing a giant snow suit & a fluffy green hood.  Then we have a huge snowball fight & start dancing.  The scene changes to us being in the ballet!?!?!?!  That is not even the first weird dream that i have had, but it the craziest.  It was kinna funny though.  I woke up & had thrown one of my fluffiest pillows accross the living room.  I've been sleeping there while i'm packing up for the Boro.  I hope everyone else is doing wonderful.  Love You All & if you want to analyze my dream please... feel free.  Peace Out!

"event","Ok, so I'm staying at home now.  I am going job hunting tomorrow since I will be stuck here for 2 months.  But that is ok, I guess.  I'm working on reading Harry Potter 3 & it is so awesome.  I don't like to read the books till after I see the movie.  It ruins the suspense if you do it the other way around.. not to mention that they leave a lot of stuff out in movies.  Harry Potter 3 was an awesome movie athough! I saw Nick in Pulaski the other day & went to a family reunion with megan.  To my suprise she told me to look out side & asked if that person looked familiar.  I was shocked to see Geoff.  I was gonna go say hi & ask him to sign megan's cast, but when i had turned around again he was walking away.  Meg's little cusin said that he saw me.  I guess some things never change & some people never grow up.  But, who cares.  I have decided that it's not worth my time.  For those who don't know... megan had a car wreck & broke her ankle.  She is doing much better now & she has a blast while i push her around in the wheel chair.  Zach is coming over on Friday & staying till Monday.  It will be great to see him.  I think we both are having withdrawls.  He's going apartment shopping in M-boro tomorrow.  Well, I'm off to read some more Harry Potter.  Take Care.  I Love you all!!!

I just haven't figured out what they are yet.  My parents moved into a new house & once again my room is the room piled mile high with boxes & most of them are not mine.  I've decided that before I move to M-boro in the fall I am going to get rid of a ton of things that i just don't use any more.  I have a feeling that it is going to be hard because I am a pack rat & there are going to be a lot of things that I will want to keep.  I need to hire a team from the show ""Clean Sweep"" to help.  lol.. Anyways... I hope that you all are having a wonderful summer like I am.  I leave for Fall Creek Falls on Friday morning for Zach's grandparents' 50th anniversary.  That is gonna be a blast.. now if i can just find my bikini I will be fine.

Go ahead & call me lame, or even stupid, but you have to do what makes you happy.  I am going to cosmotology school & from there i am gonna go through some massage classes as well.  I am gonna open up my own shop that does hair, make-up, facials, nails, manicures, pedicures, & massages... ya know... the works!  After that, or during schooling, I am gonna start modeling again.  College is not for me.  In the words of Relient K!  I have learned that if you don't do what makes you happy then you are wasting you life.  I am also moving to murfreesboro with zach & his best friend, jonathon.  My parents are actually cool with it.  They just want me to be happy.  I think that is awesome of them.  Zach's band, tobin's bridge, has just finished recording their first cd.  It's really awesome, though he is not satisfied with it... but what man is ever satisfied???  They have 3 songs online now for anyone who wants to listen to them.  It's at www.purevolume.com/tobinbridge .  They are really awesome.  well, i am gonna go take a warm bubbly bath & go to bed.

Having the personality that she has she wants to tell me the bad & cheer me up with the good.  If only cheering up was possible right now.  Well, the bad news is that a friend of mine, Robert Wolaver, from cornersville high committed suicide on monday night.  That's pretty dramatic for me.  He was a wonderful friend of mine & one of my friend, Brandon Eddy's, best friends.  So, the good news is that she got kissed by the guy she likes & he has a girlfriend.  I'm not thinking that is a good thing, but whatever floats her boat.  If it  was me i wouldn't be kissing anyone if i had a boyfriend, or if they did.  Man, i hope Robet's little sister is ok.

"event","Hello beautiful people!  So far I have had a wonderful day!  I was asked by my friend, Manuel Pinto, to watch a movie with him tomorrow night, I've only had one class, & I got a Marti Gras Mask!!!!!  Yea for my team!  Intermural basketball is tonight & I think i am gonna go watch it if i get all my studying done.  I think am gonna do well on Billy's test tomorrow.  This week has been so beautiful.  I love warm weather.  That probably explains why i have been in such a good mood.  I ever yelled out hello to Scott yesterday as i was kicking around my giant soccer ball.  I guess i am getting over being shy.  I am always so afraid of conflicts... well, that is over now.  I love everyone & am not afraid to show it!  Well, I am off to play on the computer here in the library because mine crashed.  Love you all.  God Bless!!

"event","Well, I am missing my 10 o'clock class right now.  They are trying to fix my heater for the third time right now.  They had to take my whole unitl out & now there is a huge hole in my wall where something used to be & cold air from out side is coming in like crazy.  You can look & straight to the outside.  It's freezing in there so i came in the computer lab on the second floor to seek heat.  I now think that my computer is crashed.  I can't get it to turn on.  So, looks like i will be taking that home to my dad this weekend..... (happy valentines day dad.. here's a broken computer....)  So, my friday the 13th is starting off bad.... i think i flunked another math test today & it is too late to drop the class.  *sigh*  When they were taking out the unit in my room it spilled water everywhere & there was a huge puddle of water, dirt, & mold underneath it & guess who got to clean it up??? Yea for my team! Go Mary!!  But hey, at least i got to do something useful while my fingers were falling off from being frozen.  Today my heart goes out to Kristen... I feel you girl.  Geoff is doing the exact same thing to me right now.  I can't even get the boy to say hi & I did nothing to him.  If you ever need to talk to someone i am here.  Well, everyone happy Valentines day.. I am gonna go see if they have reinstalled my unit.  God Bless you all & may you have a wonderful weekend.. Love You Guys"

"event","Well, the cafeteria food stinks.. again.. & it has all week.  But, England is getting closer & that makes me happy.  I am rooming with Felicia & Elizabeth & that will be a blast.  Last night i made pictures with Felicia at that photo thing.  I love my best friend!!  This weekend should be great.  I have myself a date.  Friday makes a month since Geoff broke up with me so i figured that i deserved it... but don't get too happy for me.. It's just a freindship date & I was the one who made it that way.  I Don't Want To Date.. ANYONE!  & Yes, it is with Zach.  Out of the seven years that we dated off & on we have never been with eachother (as in the same place) on that special day.  We are just gonna go out to dinner & go to Opry Mills & go shopping.. well, he is actually taking me shopping.  He can be such a little angel.  Cole says that i should date him & get it over with, but i don't want to be in a relationship for a while now.  I guess when you get hurt bad enough it takes a while to heal.  But, i think i am doing just fine.  Infact i am doing rather well.  I'm so excited about going home.  Valentines day my parents will be celebrating 28 years together.  That seems like forever to me.  I am so happy for them.. I love my parents.  Well, i am off to happy land for an hour or two. I am gonna watch a movie with My little buddy, Liz-Beth. God Bless.. Love you all!!"

"event","i'm so tired of being here
suppressed by all of my childish fears
and if you have to leave
i wish that you would just leave
because your presence still lingers here
and it won't leave me alone 

these wounds won't seem to heal
this pain is just too real
there's just too much that time cannot erase

when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears
when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears
and i've held your hand through all of these years
but you still have all of me

you used to captivate me
by your resonating light
but now i'm bound by the life you left behind
your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

these wounds won't seem to heal
this pain is just too real
there's just too much that time cannot erase

when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears
when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears
and i've held your hand through all of these years
but you still have all of me

i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
and though you're still with me
i've been alone all along






Have you ever had one of those days where everything you ever believed in was lost.  Or, that someone who was the closest person in your life hated you & you don't know what you did wrong???  I guess that is me now.  Well, sorry to depress you all.  Oh, i just wanted to say that i am sorry scott.  I know that i should have done things differently & I can sympathise with you now.  I am deeply sorry."

"event","wow.. what a way to start off my day.  I woke up this morning ready to crawl out of the bed & take a math test that i studied for about 2 hours last night & felt so sick that i had to lay back down on my stomach before i had to jump off of my top bunk bed & run to the bathroom.  I really wish the docotors would figure out what is wrong with me soon so that i can get on some more medicine.  I'm gonna e-mail Jackson & see if he will let me take the test sometime tomorrow sine i only have a 8:00 & 4:30 class.  Tonight should be relaxing because Ash & I are just gonna relax & watch the ""Hot Chick"".  I really don't wanna go to biology.. it's so boring.. but i hate to miss anymore class.  I feel so bad.  I used to not care about missing classes.. but now it really bothers me because i don't know how much sicker i am gonna get.  If i do have to have radiation my parents will have to pull me out of school.  I really don't want that to happen.  I am gonna miss everyone enough when i transfer to MTSU with in the next 2 years.  But, it will be worth it to have an art degree.  I hate being a business major.  Well, i better e-mail Jackson.. wish me luck.  Talk to you all later.. Love Ya... God Bless!"

"event","Well, now that i can actually sit at my computer & stay still i will write an entry to fill all of you in on what has been going on in this head of mine.  Yes, i am scared to death about the whole tumor situation, though i do not know that is what it is right now.  Just having that posibility hanging over my head kills me, but as Zach would say ""don't think about it"".  That is easier said than done.  2 weeks & no test results back on my blood test.  On the subject of Zach... NO we are not together again... I am taking time to be single for the first time in my life, but that does not mean that we are not closer than we have ever been.  The night i called him about me going to the doctors we had a long cry together on the phone & he swore that he would not let me go through this alone.  He wanted to meet some of my friends so my parents invited him to stay the weekend with me last weekend.  He came to the choir concert (& i wish that he didn't have to hear us stink that bad) & got to meet my new best friend.... Felicia!!!  I love her to death.  We seem to spend all our free time together.  We became best friends the night that Geoff broke up with me.  She was there when i needed her the most.  Ok, now... on the subject of Geoffrey Scott... we have gotten to where we are able to talk a little... though i do most of the talking & usally do it first.. but he is a very busy man.  If i had 23 hours i wouldn't have time to do anything.  I hope he is feeling better because he was kinna sick yesterday.  Yes, i still care for him more than anything, but I just want him to be happy & if that means without me being a big part in his life... so be it.  For those of you who were at the game last night... Yes.. it was me being Rowdy for the last 30 min or so of the boys game.  I think that was the most fun i have had in a long time.  Well, after taking my hour shower this morning i realized how much i have grown up in the past 2 weeks.. Thank you Geoff.  Afterall, if not for you i would have never realized it.  Well, i am off to getting ready to go another day & go home.  Zach is picking me up & we are gonna go hang out with our friends that we have had since the 8th grade in sparta.  & he got 3 puppies that are 8 weeks old that i am dying to play with.  OH... i forgot.. I got my passport & to celebrate .. my mom got me a pretty fan tail gold fish that i named Koi (that is japanese for love.. or so the internet says) .... the very next day i have in from class & she was dead.. :(... oh well, on a happy note.. I love all of you guys.. have  a wonderful weekend.  My love & prayers go out to you all!  xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo"

"event","<FONT color=#33cc00>WoW! I am loving being at home.... i'm not sure if i ever want to leave. So far during my 3 day vacation i've lounged around in my pj's, made peanut butter cookies, played with my 2 cats &amp; parakeet, &amp; listened to music. To be able to curl up in my warm water bed is a privelage that i haven't had in a long time. I don't come home very often. I've really discovered the kind of future mate that i want from watching my parents. Sinced i am the baby &amp; that means that it's empty nest time, my parents have bonded beyond belief. They are so cute. My mom is really sick right now &amp; my dad is taking really good care of her. I just want someone to look at me the way he looks at her. It's as if it's his birthday &amp; she is the present that he has always wanted. My parents are coming to our choir concert in Tullahoma because that is only 35 min away from where i live. My dad will have to get someone to preach for him that morning, but i'm sure that he will. There may be hope for me going to England afterall... if it is true that the school has the money for me, my parents are gonna find some way to get me a passport!!!! I'm so excited!!! I decided to eat something healthy after stuffing my face with all those peanut butter cookies that i made earlier &amp; dug some frozen blueberries out of the freezer. I don't think those 2 foods mix well cause i have a tummy ache that won't go away. I've been hitting the gym pretty hard everyday since we have all been back. It's a great way to release some stress. Anyone care to join me??? Well, i am downloading some music on Kazaa so i am off to find some more songs. I love &amp; miss you all! See you on tuesday :)!! Take Care &amp; God Bless</FONT>"

"event","Things are finally cooling down on the campus of Martin Methodist High... lol.. I am so glad.  This first semester has been a horrible one so far.  I can only hope that things will get better.  For all of those people that I acted horribly tward.. I'm sorry.  Last night i did an awkward thing.  I ran around the campus green, in the freezing cold, at 12:00 am!!  I guess it helped release some stress.  Today is good because i am going home.  I've skipped all my classes once again & i promise not to do it anymore.  There are just some days that you need to sit alone & think & today was just one of those days.  I feel as if i lost a huge part of my life a little over a week ago.  Have you ever had something that just seemed so right that it could not be true?  I guess i experienced that.  I just truly want that person to be happy with out a shaddow of a doubt & I miss our friendship so badly.  He was the kind of person you could tell anything to & the sun would seem to shine & everything would be ok.  Where ever you are, my darling, I still care & if you ever need me whisper it to the sky & I will be there, awaiting your call.. even when you have nothing to say at all.  I just want everything to be back to the way it was before we all left for Christmas break.  I love you all.. Have a wonderful weekend.  Take Care & May God shine his eternal love upon you all"

We both know what we need to do, but neither one of us want to face it. 
When it comes down to it, nobody wants to face reality; we just want to go on pretending like everything is okay. 
Nobody wants to hurt, to be sad and lonely. Even if it means happiness in the end. But the end is far and the present is here. The present is what will keep us in a rut until we finally see the bigger picture. Ignorance is bliss. 

I should write for Grey's Anatomy."

"event","<p>Well here I am in Wisconsin. Sad to be away from friends but nice to see family.<br /><br />I pretty much already had christmas. My beautiful boyfriend bought me a ring! (Not an engagment ring or anything!) That was my favorite present. And maybe the fake ID my mom found for me since the bastards at Peabody's took mine. Other than that Christmas was good.<br /><br />Now Im stuck up here for 10 days probably ending up to be bored out of my mind. I'll get&nbsp; some good shopping done. And I'm soooo excited to eat at my favorite restraunt Maggianos!! YUMM!<br /><br />New Years will probably be one of the worst since everyone is going to Vegas. Oh well. Least I will be home for it spending it with close friends.</p><p>Well I'm going to try and go to bed. Tomorrow we're food shopping and hopefully finding a gym=]</p><p>ps. I'm watchin James and the Giant Peach! I love this movie!!<br /><br /></p>"

actions speak louder than words.
all I hear is volume. Your volume.
It pierces the ackward silences&nbsp;
yet is paralyized by reality.

I know what I know,
I believe in what you say.
But without motions
a sound wont matter&nbsp;
not now, not ever, especially not today.

Na na, na na na, na na
I miss you, miss you so bad
I don't forget you, oh it's so sad
I hope you can hear me
I remember it clearly

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same 
Ooooh

Na na na na na na na

I didn't get around to kiss you
Goodbye on the hand
I wish that I could see you again
I know that I can't

Oooooh
I hope you can hear me cause I remember it clearly

The day you slipped away
Was the day I found it won't be the same
Ooooh

I had my wake up
Won't you wake up
I keep asking why
And I can't take it
It wasn't fake
It happened, you passed by

Now your gone, now your gone
There you go, there you go
Somewhere I can't bring you back
Now your gone, now your gone
There you go, there you go,
Somewhere your not coming back

The day you slipped away
Was the day i found it won't be the same noo..
The day you slipped away
Was the day that i found it won't be the same oooh...

Na na, na na na, na na
I miss you

Dear Grandma, 
I hope your in heaven. And Im happy you are no longer suffering. Im sorry the last couple years I havn't really been close like we used to be. Blame it all on me. I just wanted you to know that everything you did was perfect. I'll miss so much about you, you don't even know. I'll miss your laugh, your smile, your swimming ""froggy style"", your cooking, your advise, your purfume that we always tried so hard to find, but most of all I'll miss how every night you told me you loved me no matter what I did. And would kiss my forehead and you gave that little giggle. I miss that so much. I hope you are dancing with the angles, and I look forward seeing you again when I die. I always imagined you at my wedding so when that time comes, please be there too. I love you so much Grandma, Watch over me. 

Love your oldest granddaughter,
Lindsey"

ahhh i hate spiders. especially when your crossing a bridge and you find a spider in your car on the visor above your head. What do you do? Pull over in Bears' furniture, jump out of the car, laugh your head off, and then take your flip flop and hit it out of your car. (I guess im speaking for holly)"

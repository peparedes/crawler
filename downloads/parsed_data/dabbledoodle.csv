"event","I don't know what it is, but I can't seem to 'WANT' to fall asleep until early, early in the morning.  If I was back in Oakville, there would be birds singing outside my window right now, but since its the city and there are no trees near my window...only the low rumble of a streetcar echos down my street.

I came home from work tonight and decided to watch Sex and the City. 

And wanting to be productive, I drew my most favorite grey kitty ever.

Binx.

I feel dirty.

Not Christina Aguilera dirty, just sort of grubby.

I had this case of sickness that lasted five hours.  It tore my throat apart and took away my voice.  It made me sleep until 3:30 in the afternoon yesterday.

Of course, I now feel fine.

Hurrah!

I'm putting a couple sketches today since I didn't post yesterday.

I found this picture I had done for my mom for letting me crash at her place for a month.  Its of her ugly cat, the cat taht always looked angry.  It was the ugliness that made it somewhat cute and fasinating to draw.

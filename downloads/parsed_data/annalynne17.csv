Rainy, grey, and windy - I hope no one has a broken heart today. Days like this can only be handled when you know you have the next 6 days off and there is 24 days till Christmas and 25 days till Spruce Lake, and you just drank a cup of tea that warmed you to your toes, and you just talked to your friend in Ontario, and Christmas music is playing, and life couldn't be better even if George Bailey lassoed the moon and gave it to you. (sorry I couldn't help adding that Christmasy touch at the end)"

"event","Thursday:
Mom, me and Tommy wait at wrong gate. J-M and Julie come. Wait for bags for 20 minutes - really hot in the airport. Windy and rainy and ugly outside. Mom drives really slow. Eat homemade pizza that Mary surprisingly didn't ruin. Hugh and Gael come, Aunt Barb, Candy, and Bethany come, Aunt Candy and Brandon come, Eric, Leah and Constance come, Laura, Lucas, and Nicholas come, Uncle Dave and Perris come, Adam North comes. Nicholas drops everything to give J-M a high-five. Ornament head drops on J-M, Tom's plan foils. Play spoons, me and Julie tie. We learn that seagulls explode when given aspirin. Dad likes J-M cause J-M likes hurricane Juan 'unbelievable devastation'. Dave has boring Europe stories. J-M and me chat on msn. Julie's bed sounds like thunder.

Friday:
Dad gets a haircut and his head gets 70% smaller. Go to bookstore and meet the other hippie. Go to Peggy's Cove. Julie wants to see someone swept off cliff 'if its gonna happen'. Big huge rocks to climb. Dad befriends a random tourist. Eat at Fish and Chips restaurant. Me and Bethany can't stop laughing. Me and Tom play Dutch Blitz for the first time and unintentionally cheat. Julie shuffles really good. Julie invents new rules for Dutch Blitz. Play Elfer Raus. Julie plays J-M's cards for him. Me and J-M take Nicholas for a walk to feed the ducks. Bold ducks. Uncle Steve comes forgets he met J-M, J-M forgets he met Uncle Steve. Almost die on way to bonfire with Mrs. Vaughan. Geek is a swear word you know ""Really?"". I learn that some stop signs are optional. Can't find Feather Lane cause its pitch dark. Mrs. Vaughan wears a funny hat. Roast hot dogs and marshmellows. Dave tries to trick me. Tom condescends and eats a hot dog off a stick. Sing It is Well REALLY fast and the rest REALLY high. J-M fakes a cop. The word gullible is taken from dictionary, the moon is bigger then ever, don't need to dim the lights 'but dad always does'. Play Dutch Blitz in pairs, me and J-M get trounced, Julie and Tom win. Try to convince Dave to go to SL then stop cause he keeps singing. Go to bed when mom says 'scat'.

Saturday: 
Go to conference. Mrs. Bouter tells J-M to put something in the covered area. Dad reads Colossians 1:11. Dad tells J-M that meatballs are safe. Play hockey, me and Bethany are sticks in the mud. I give Tommy a twoonie, he buys a drink gives me the quarters I give them back, he puts them on Bouters coffee table, Mrs.Bouter gives them to J-M, J-M puts them in his pocket, gives them to me, I put them on the mantel, Dad uses them for parking meter on Sat. Play DB in Hanneke's basement. I mistake gambling chips for Golden Oreos. Play Elfer Raus. J-M plays my cards for me. Try Scattergories but suck so we stop. J-M finds five pink Mentos in a row. We LLOL. Sit around and say nothing then Dave leaves and we talk then Dave comes back and we talk till 2:00 am. A Hallmark moment between Dave and J-M, strict parents 'you couldn't go on field trips either?'. The lamp is totally in my way. I hear Mom coming and we turn off the lights and hide. Go to bed REALLY quietly.

Sunday: 
Pretend like we're not tired and get up really early. Go to meeting. Me, J-M and Julie listen to Pellerins talk about Crest vs Arm and Hammer. Dad says 'phoney baloney' during ministry. Sing ""God in Mercy"" with different words. Cannings come for tea. J-M gives Eric AutoCad. Play DB again Julie and Tom win again. I sweep cookies away from Eric. J-M and me race to see who can wake up Nicholas first, J-M wins. J-M and Dave pretend to like each other for a meaningful pic. Take J-M and Julie to airport and rush cause we think flight times are wrong. Say goodbye :( Really sad. J-M forgets pen drive at the airport. I get a call from Redekop, John W. Talk for 1:36 minutes. Feel really sad. Drink after eight hot chocolate and go to bed.

I'm taunting (or tempting) fate by announcing that it will still be a good day.

I am thankful that the Pilgrims and the Natives found a way to get along so that I could have perogies tonight 

I am thankful that I didn't act on my impulse last night and go on standby for a flight to Wayne, NJ. In hindsight I realize it might not have been the brightest decision 

I am thankful for grandparents who can find a million different ways of telling you how special they think you are

I am thankful for a nephew who keeps me slim by saying ""num a num"" everytime I sit down with something to eat 

I am thankful for unexpectedly memorable moments

I am thankful that there is beauty everywhere if you take the time to look for it

I am thankful for MSN ;) 

But most of all I am thankful that my Wonderful God decided to use a brilliant pallet of orange and golden and crimson when creating this masterpiece of a fall day and that He gave me the opportunity to enjoy it 

With all these things what more could a girl want? 

::.I wasn't planning to write this, it's sort of an after thought. I wonder if turkeys are dragged out that Canadians and Americans celebrate thanksgiving at different times of the year. I mean, wouldn't you rather have the slaughtering over and done with?.::"

"event","If the sun would break out I would gird up my loins right this minute and make haste to go do the hundreds of nitpicky things I have to do. There's been a major backlog on the things I need to get done and my ""to-do"" list is pretty much a sham and shall be used as kindle for tonights fire. But since it's still a burdensomely grey day outside and the wind is continuing to slap the wet scraggly leaves of the hanging plant against the window, I shall remain here as a sluggish sloth. 

I stood out the kitchen today and eyed a bag of chewy brownies. 
Bad Anna thinks: Mmmmmmm
Good Anna thinks: Don't even think about it sister
Bad Anna thinks: Crunchy on the outside chewy on the inside
Good Anna thinks: You just bought a size 7 skirt...
Bad Anna thinks: It would only take a minute to make a cup of tea
Good Anna thinks: You had a chocolate bar last night
Bad Anna thinks: I did?  
Good Anna nods her head gravely
Bad Anna plods away defeated 

I felt license to eat 100 chewy brownies to the power of 2 after I went racquetballing last Thursday. I was sure I had burned off half the calories I had consumed in the last 5 years. Mind you when it was me and Leah playing each other we spent a jolly amount of the time trying to pick up the ball after we had served it...the fool thing was so skittish.

The sun hasn't broken out. Yea, my get-up-and-go doth not shine. But I must go all the same :( 

This may prove to be an empty promise but I'm going to try and blog more faithfully."

Although the calender says it's only been three weeks, it feels like AGES since I've last written here. I mean, technically I've posted a few times but nothing of real worth. And I am known for writing gut-wrenching, spine-tingling, palm-sweating, knee-knocking, worthwhile thrillers...so sorry for the delay. 
There's not alot to write about...no, to be honest, there are many things I could talk about but the problem with everything that has happened is that either it's something that I don't want to write about or it's something that you'd rather not hear. So I guess we're in a pickle aren't we?
I've been contemplating lately the troubling enigma about the balance of structure and spontaneity. On one hand I value a scheduled existence (i.e. wake-up, go to work, go to bed). And yet I find myself missing the pleasurable life I had for two weeks of doing whatever I wanted whenever I wanted to. I wish the two would come to a compromise so that I could be a free-spirited woman in a secure world. Have I lost you? Good, now I have company.
My life of insignificance is suddenly making me feel insignificant."

After all, it's summer, I'm relatively young and comparatively accomplished. And the sky tonight looked like the aftermath of a heavenly visitation...you know the kind of sunset I mean. Mind you, if I fully grasped the reality that the rest of my family is over in Halifax watching the Tattoo whilst I remain here alone in the now dark house, since I had to babysitt at 6:00, I may feel a twinge of discontent. 
Last night at work, it was so boring that me and Steve would drop the sample cups for the excitement of picking them up. You see, the way the bakery works, you're either running around so fast that you actually get motion sickness, or its so painfully slow that you have to keep retying your apron for amusement. Nonetheless, it's good to be working...
Listen, I'm planning on uploading a video from the young people's trip to Carter's beach on July 1st. It's three-quarters done, and when it's finished, I'm planning to put it on youtube so that you can see it. If I really put my nose to the grindstone, I might have it done tonight.

When I was babysitting the other day, Sophie, who is the atypical example of a babysitting nightmare, cocked her head and said to me around her pacifier, ""Anna, do you REALLY know your dad?""

Is she parroting someone, or did she just randomly decided to fire that question at me? 

I have to start working at the bakery tomorrow. I'm all pumped with my old white sneakers ready and waiting. I wonder if Bill would have hired me if he had known my true core values:

Today was graduation rehearsal. Pretty much THE boringest thing I've ever been to. At times like a graduation, no good can come of having a last name that starts with the letter ""R"". I did love seeing the prom pictures though. Today, I also saw a girl I hadn't seen for years. She was as thin as the chains hanging around her neck, her hair was white and coarse, and her eyes were like empty windows. I felt like crying when I remembered how she used to come and play on my back deck with me and my stuffed dog, and how we used to run around together in elementry. I always feel a kick in the gut when I see her because I always think that maybe if I had stuck with her, things would have turned out differently.  

The things I love about summer are: 
~Eating a slice of strawberry pie with vanilla ice cream 
~Airing out my suitcase
~Smelling the Bourgeois having a barbeque next door
~Sitting by the living room window and watching the sun flicker in fluid golden patterns on the wall above the couch
~Hearing birds first thing in the morning and going to sleep to the sound of crickets at night
~Filling out my GC registration card

If you read my live journal and have an lj account, request to be my friend. If you read this and don't have an account, have a heart and create one. I need more friends on this thing, to spice it up. Consider it a graduation gift. If the account thing doesn't seem like a good idea for a graduation gift, I could also really use a car."

"event","I'm sorry for always saying that I'm going to update soon, and then never write for an age and half. It must be very annoying. 
That being said, today went from being extremely stressful to sentimental to fun to dread and then back to stress.
Let me recap:
I started today by being stressed because I had an oral French exam with Bethany. It went okay if you looked beyond our vague answers and painful franglais. I think Madame Cormier did because she said we did ""tres bien,""...either she's really nice, or my comprehension of French is so poor that I'm misunderstanding her praise. 
The day then became sentimental due to a Goodbye Grad assembly. There was fun parts like when the dance team danced to all the songs by all the bands that were in when we were young like ""Spice Girls"", ""Backstreet Boys"", and ""S-Club"". But there was sad parts too. Watching the teachers say goodbye made me feel like crying. Because I realized that in a sense I'm not only graduating from high school. I'm also graduating from show-and-tell and gym class and walking down worm-strewn streets. I'm graduating from cranky teachers and school desks,PA systems, glue and construction paper, assemblies,bus evacuations and fire drills. It seems random to feel sad a leaving all those things behind but I guess you don't realize how much you enjoy something till its starting to slip away. Sigh.
The remainder of my time up spent at the school was fun since there was a barbecue. I committed what was hopefully my last stupid moment of my school career when I stuck all my three vouchers which were supposed to give you a hamburger, hot dog, and a drink w/ chips, into the hamburger box, leaving me to eat my burger minus the drink and minus the chips. 
I felt dread when I had to go to Bill with the list of dates I couldn't work because he is so awkward I was dreading him only grunting in response or disappearing behind the case. It went okay though.
And right now I'm stressed because Edmonton is playing for the Stanley Cup against Carolina in 2 hours. But it is an excited stress since I KNOW they're going to win. Go Edmonton!!! 
Later."

The sneaky little bug attacked me a week after I considered myself safe from Mom's bout with it. And yes, I finally went to the Sobeys bakery and got a job. I start in 2 weeks after I get my SIN number, etcetera. 
But I don't feel like writing about it anymore because it makes me panic. So I'll move in.
I'm getting pumped for Friday. Nothing beats the Spring Conference. On a very small scale, it is kind of like a mini, condensed, shortened, GC. And since its starting to look like it could be the closest to GC I get this year, I'm prepared to thoroughly enjoy it.
Around our computer is infested with ants. I keep feeling like they are crawling on me. It's very unsettling. 
I had to babysit across the street tonight and made a measly 10 bucks. Babysitting is the most underpaid job in the whole world. Mind you, tonight was easy since the kids went to bed almost right away. All I had to do was sit on the couch and watch TV, which I might add goes down hill in terms of showing anything decent for consumption everytime I watch it. I'm so terribly glad I grew up in a TV-free house. 
I was watching a CNN report on the voice recordings from Flight 93. It was too heartbreaking. I had to flick the channel.  
I'm hungry, and I'm cold, and my face feels tight from sitting to long on the deck. I think I need a cup of tea."

Last night was the Answers in Genesis seminar at Northbrook Bible Chapel. It was pretty incredible to be reminded of the vastness and complexity of God's awesome creation. 
It almost made me feel like laughing. How many times have I thought that my problems were to big for the Lord to handle? Too many times to admit, I'm afraid. But I was thinking last night when Richard was talking of the finite universe being controlled by the infinite God, that if He holds all that in the Palms of His Hands, how small then must my problems seem to him? And yet I'd rather take care of them myself, and not trust them to the One who sustains all of creation. How...embarrassing!

Sorry for not being the most faithful blogger ever. I was much more consistent when I wrote in my space. There is no excuse. I'm just lazy.
So in the long stretch since I have written, I must honestly admit that nothing has transpired worth writing about. Oh,I bought an outfit for Grandma and Grandad's 60th anniversary that is GORGEOUS but has an OUTRAGEOUS price. It's really a shame that beauty and bucks are such friends.
Speaking of clothes, me and Laura and Mary went to the Halifax Shopping center last night and found the dream store. There was SO many beautiful skirts. It felt like we kept pulling them out. I was just waiting for the money to start pouring out of my pockets to complete the dream. But it didn't, and so we left distraught and discontented.  
I've been working with Dave and Co. on a movie for G&G's anniversary. A very touching video featuring songs like ""Sentimental Journey"", ""You Raise Me Up"", ""Remember When"", and ""To God be the Glory"". I wish there was a way I could set up a link so everyone could see it. We will see.

I've been moderately busy, trying to find time in between filming a movie for French and working through stacks of homework, to watch a bit of the olympics. Sad to say, the main attraction has been ousted prematurely, ie. Canada was unceremoniously trounced by their arch enemy Russia in the quarter final showdown. Today, I've been reading way too many articles that repeat and repeat again the possible reasons why such a strong hockey team could wind up sixth overall. It's really getting my dander up. Stop analyzing this loss to death! Chill! They were an awesome team that ran into tough luck, who were under a TREMENDOUS amount of pressure from the VERY SAME people who can't understand why they lost. Who knows? Maybe they realized that every move they made was  going to be scrutinized by big, lazy guys with thick necks and tuxes that don't know the first thing about what it feels like to have the whole country breathing down your neck, waiting to pounce. I don't care what anyone else says, EVERY single player that wore the maple leaf on their chest for the past two weeks DESERVED to be in Turino. So there.

Now that I have myself sufficiently worked up...

I think I'm going to go to bed. I have to get up at 7:30 tomorrow and wash my hair, then trudge up to Geology, which I may modestly add, I have a knack for. Sorry Bethany, but I just seem to be able to grasp plate tectonics and igneous rocks. Our school is having a Disney assembly in the afternoon to raise money to send a little girl to Disneyland for her last wish. I happily gave the two dollars, but I don't know if I really feel like going to the assembly. Maybe I'll skip...

"event","I was going to change my user pic to the symbol of the 2006 Olympics to commemorate the official beginning of them, but I couldn't find one that fit the rigid measurements required. Oh well. 
Today in French class we had our own mini opening ceremonies. It was one of THE most awkward school-related activities I have ever engaged in. It was all me and Bethany could do to contain our laughter that just had to bubble out when the whole class had to stand in front of the room and lift our right hand and chant the Olympic oath. Having to listen to the Olympic hymn was even worse. There is nothing harder then trying not to laugh. It's almost painful. 
But anyway, I'm sorry I haven't kept this journal updated. I would say I haven't had time, but that would be untrue...I've just gotten off a glorious vacation of one week. Second semester started on Wednesday which means I now have French, Canadian Literature, and Geology. French will be fun since Bethany, Jessica and Ashley are all in my class... I foreshadow many fun times. Can Lit is okay too, since I have the same teacher I had for Advanced English, and I like her teaching style. Geology could go either way. In one sense it will be fine because it will mostly be boring facts about rocks. Using the word 'rocks' to describe geology has just defeated everything the teacher has been emphasizing for the past couple of days ""Geology is not about rocks it is about the universe, and it has the capability of changing your life"". As if. On the other hand the people in the class make it a daily dread. I know absolutely no one and there are not only one but THREE Mooseheads (which means they play for Halifax's hockey team, not a slander at their physical appearance), not to mention various other avoidable people. You should be reading some pretty dramatic stories in my journal for the next couple of months!  
What a boring entry this has been! I wanted to provide you with something amusing to read and instead it has turned out to be a boring narrative on things you probably could care less about. 
Before I stop I think I'm going to share with you a story from global history last semester to reward you for your patience in reading this. I laughed and laughed over it when it happened, but it's probably one of those ""you-had-to-be-there"" things. I'll give it a shot anyway. 
Okay, before I start, I need to describe my history teacher. Mr.Lawrence is one of those men who look like they had a mid-life crisis at 40 and then rebounded happily several years later, but the tell tale wrinkles and paunch have remained. He is of the kind of people that are most happy garbed in green cord pants and a knitted cardigan. To be honest, he looks like a veggie tale character in earthy hues. He deceives you by making you think that he is always serious but then lets out a burst of uncontained laughter at unexpected times. Mike, the other character in my story, is a student council sort of guy, funny and confident. He, as this story proves, is really quick with wit. 
So, it was before a test and the class was waiting for the test papers. My history class was really loud the kind that requires the word ""din"" to describe the level of noise. Mr.Lawrence was hard pressed to keep them in check and he was desperately trying to regain control of the students before handing out the test papers. He is a meek and mild man, fairly patient, but finally he snapped and shouted ""What part of no talking don't you understand?!""
The class became relatively quiet. Then Mike piped up.
""It's actually the no part. Is that spelled 'know' or 'no'?"" 
Hahahaha. I laughed so hard. And of course Mr.Laurence burst into one of his uproarious giggles and chuckled at intervals all through the test. 
I'm laughing as I type it, but you're probably thinking, ""What was the point?"" 
I simply have to stop this entry before it gets any longer. I don't blame you if you're not reading anymore. I don't even feel like re-reading it to make sure it there are no mistakes. Okay, Anna, STOP ALREADY!!!:)"

"event","I finally tackled my room tonight after putting it off all week. I did it while holding Nicholas on my hip (I had to watch him tonight) and listening to CJLU. It's ridiculous how messy your room can get if you let it. 

I feel like I've been off school for ages...and it's only Friday. I wouldn't dare say that I'm bored of lazing around and want to go back, but... 

I've been adding pictures to the site I posted, so keep checking it. They're not in any order because I post them as I find them. I've been going through some of my computer files and deleting a whole bunch of junk.

I need people to recommend some good movies where the PG on the cover actually means you can watch it without wincing. Suggestions? 

I'm so proud of myself...the other day I was making cupcakes but I was home alone which meant it was just me and the cookbook, no mom for reference. The cookbook was a loser and didn't tell me how long I had to cook them, so I took an educated (or rather, wild) guess. I was right on! I think that is the first time I've predicted something while cooking and its actually been right. 

Why must I always have colds? 

I seriously have to change my user pic. I look irritatingly whimsical."

"event","EXAM'S ARE OVER!!! I'm so glad - I have the rest of this week off and don't go back till Tuesday. My history exam yesterday was suspiciously easy...I'm always suspicious when I find things easy. It's highly unusual.  
There was a snowstorm last night and school was canceled (of course, since I had the day off anyway). I didn't go to piano lessons this afternoon because I have a cold and didn't feel like crawling out into the blowing snow. I ended up going out anyway to Dad's bookstore and wandered around aimlessly while he did miscellaneous things. 
This is turning into a boring entry and my eyes are burning so I'm going to stop. For fun, I'm going to add a link to an online photo album of random pictures from last year. There are much more to be added.

"event","Like Mary said in her last post, people from my msn space that read my live journal will no longer be able to comment because I have changed the settings so that only friends can post comments. Sorry for the inconvenience. If you are absolutley dying to say something to me about my post, you can always comment in my space and I'll just read it there. Or you can set up your own account :)I'll be updating my journal later on today, but right now I have to run up through the snow to school to finish my provincial English exam. Till then!"

"event","I went skating last night at Cole Harbour place. I haven't skated for the past two years, so it was with extremely tentative caution that I placed my ugly figure skates onto the ice. Surprisingly I could still skate and a slid across the ice like a graceful swan over a glassy lake...or maybe more like a duck trying frantically to stay afloat in bumpy waters. 
It's funny. For the past two years I haven't really wanted to go to the free skate at Cole Harbour because it seemed like there was always so many people there from school that I didn't feel like lumbering shakily by. It was like ""The"" place to hang out with your cool friends on a Friday night and so it was crowded with all these kids that were my age, which to me was always overwhelming. Well, when I went yesterday, I was surprised to discover that I have outgrown the age of the kids that go skating at Cole Harbour on Friday nights. It was merely a whole bunch of junior-high aged people...guys with semi-deep voices and shags trying to impress the girls, and girls that get dressed up to go sit in the line-changing box and ogle the guys. They still stop at the side boards and flip their hair and push each other around, but know I can sail on past them and say ""Been there, done that, threw out the t-shirt."" 
I remember always thinking the Skate Patrol guys were the be all and end all, and that the embarrassment of ending up on your bottom was worth the hope that they would come over and ask you if you were all right. And now they have turned into college boys with red slush jackets on, and ""I don't feel like being here"" stamped on their face. They're so persnickety too. ""Hey, keep skating dude."" ""C'mon people keep moving."" ""Listen man, you can't just stop skating."" 
I could go on, but you probably don't feel like reading more, and frankly I don't feel like writing anymore. Before I leave though, I want you know that I do realize that I agree with you that my user pic is really ugly. I'm going to change it as soon as I find a new one. 
Later."

I had ambitions of writing a lengthy and heart-warming epistle, but I feel the need for a cup of tea. Plus it's 10:52, I'm exhausted, and I have a software applications exam first thing tomorrow. Leave some comments and make me happy. But sign your name so I don't have to run myself ragged trying to uncover  your identity. I'm like that, so take mercy on me and just put your name."

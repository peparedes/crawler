"event","so this last weekend was fun!!!
on friday I babysat for mrs. moreau and her son is by far the most fun thing to play with ever....! hes like a toy
then i hung out with derek and we went to oscaars...and then we drove / walked down xmas card lane.... and i had to pee REALLY REALLY REALLY bad so we stopped by lindsays house because it was like 10:00pm and i saw lights on.....so i went in and used the bathroom and her parents...of course...embarrassed me to no end telling him all my nicknames n all from back in the day. and then we talked for like 45 minutes..then we went back to MC and i learned to drive stick shift.....sorta!!

then on saturday was winter formal....and i was sposed to work so i **mysteriously** got the flu... and then laura warner came over at like 12ish to do my hair and she did such an amazing job!!!!...and then i got all ready and i used rerally thick dark makeup but it was fun...and BIG fake eyelashes....(for those of you who kno they were my rumors ones!! oh yeah huge!) and then we went to dinner at Brandon Davis's house and that was so beautiful...even though we were late thank you james!  But yes his house is amazing and the dinner was fantasic and filling.....and then we left for the dance and got their right at 8 because were cool like that....i guess....and got breathalized.....and then we left at ten and tried to find something to do but our group was gay and we ended up driving around for a while and then we went to poway because nicole said we should and then she ditched roger (her date) to go with some stupid junior who didnt even go to the dance was drinking while driving and didnt even have his six months up....she left with him event hough roger said he would drive her wherever she wanted to go....smart girl???....uhhhhhh NO  So then i got pissed and james had some alcohol in his car although he was sober i drank a little and the passenger bryan did too and then i fell asleep in the back seat and then they dropped me off at home and nicole was sposed to call me at 1230 to let me know she was ok and roger was gonna call her to let her know she needed to head home at that time but when we called her...guess what......her fone died....how wierd??.....so roger and i stayed up till 2 worried about her....funfunfun...i got home at 1245 and i was up till two when she finnally called,  ""oh sorry my fone died"" how many other people were at the party she was at who had fones she could have borrowed....shes hott people will let her borrow a fone if she asked but no0o0o0o0o0oo00o.....

anyways then it was sunday...i woke up at like 10 and we went to get a xmas tree at like 1130 and i had to be at a theatre workshop with my sister at one so we got the tree and left to go to the workshop and then from the workshop i went straight to work.....4-9...not too bad but still arghhhhhh....then i talked to chris and then derek and then i slept.

today was another boring day at school...but i hung out with bobby pitrone....and yeah i got sick from my starbucks and yeah life is grand

"event","haha so yesterday was the worst day ever...i went to school as normal as could be but by second peiod my stummy was hurting a bit but being a TA in the nurses office i didnt think anything of it....so naturally when i got to third i asked to go to the nurses and my loving caring teahcer said no....so i felt horrible all third period... then when i got to fourth i asked mrs LT if after the test i could go to the nurse and she said ""of course!"" well, when i finished my test, i handed it to her and ran outside ....on my way out i threw up...kept it in my mouth tho just so no one would have to see / smell it! anyways i ran to a trashcan outside and threw up like 10 more times.....then i went to the nurse and came home...couldnt eat sleep or drink (even water!!)....so i sat and cried...what a baby i know but it hurt and i couldnt stop it.....i tried to eat and drink so that i wouldnt end up in the hospital for dehydration. guess what my grand total of food / drink intake were for the day......drum roll please...............5 crackers and a gatoraid...which all ame right back up. yummy huh?
yes well today i am not at school i might go for 5th but i still feel sick so idk

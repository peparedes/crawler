I graduated High school.  I was 10th in my class. Its not that big of a deal since there were only 26 people in my class. haha

I started attending college. I have made some amazing friends there. So different are they from the people I knew in knew in high school. 
The first year of college went wonderfully. Great grades and all.
I just set up classes for my second year.

Right now I am working at Casey's making pizza, but I put in my resume at the Army corps up in Peoria. If I get that job.. oh boy the possibilities.  Ill still keep my job at Casey's for the extra spending money. 

Life in a small town hasn't changed much. Still gossip mongers and all that.
Well thats about it.
Not all the details and some of the bad things left out.. but thats how the wind blows."

"event","Well lets see... I got a new cell phone yesterday, its nothing to hightech.. no camera or anything...but still its a phone I can use to call who i want to..as long as they are verison wireless people. haha...

Its friggen hot here in D-town. Im scorching up!! Its like 90degrees out. I swear!!

About morp.. there are a couple of guys im thinking abour asking to go with me.. Im not sure if anyone of them will say yes but hey its worth a shot... I'm thinking about asking Brock S...Jace.. Stout...or Seth.. Probably not seth though.. I mean we're friends but were not tight. Well im not tight with Brock either, but it's all good. Jessica said I should ask jace cause he's adorable(which I agree with...) but I dunno. Jace and I are good buddies but he said today he might not go to morp at all.. maybe I can convience him...

What happened in the year 1772? I keep trying to remember, but it escapes me.. You might wonder why I want to know and the simple truth is that those are the last 4 digits to my cell... and when I heard them I started thinking about what happened that year.. I know it was something big.. it was during the American Revolution time... mayhaps I should ask Mrs Sloan... yes well off to another topic...

I'm getting my senior pictures taken in Bloomington next saturday and I'm so excited!!! I'm having a group photo with 10 of the senior girls. I wish I could get 5 more people to come with. I wouls love to have a pic with Em, Karen, Carol, Ben and Andy... Id even want Alex and Andrew to be in the picture, but I told Authur that i was bringing ten girls.. I dont know if amanda is comming though so I guess one spot might be open....

Oh well I Really should get back to writing my english speech.. after all its due tomorrow first hour. AH! and im only half done... yipes!

"event","ok so i got bored in school and started writing a gramatically incorrect story 

so here it is. 

""No way!"" Liz laughed ""He wouldnt do that, its so lame! Why would he do that, Gin?"" 
On the other side of the wire Ginny just laughed and said"" I dont know but its cute right?"" 
""well it is if you like corny things why do you put up with him?""Liz asked""i mean i know you think him adorable and such but he is so lame. Dereick would be better for you Gin!"" 
""well Elizabeth"" Gin Countered ""Joe loves me. He may be corny and as you so say lame, but i truly love him!"" 
Liz sat up in her chair and closed her eyes tightly. when she opended them again her vision was a little hazy. ""you dont know what love is Ginny, you dont know what true love truly is!"" 
""oh and you do Liz?! You and dereick doing so well that your telling me that he is perfect for me?! Ginny shouted through the recever and slammed the phone down on the dial.""Damn her always thinking shes right!"" 
""Ginnefer! Why the hell are you yelling?! Get your ass down here now!"" Called Gin's mom. 
Gin walked down the stairs leading to the front room. She looked around it thinking how dirty it was, and how her mother never cleaned it up. The clothes piled up in the cornor that belonged to her moms ex-boyfriends and the beer bottles and cans on the tables. She sighed and looked at the couch. Sitting there was Joe, her joe, the one good thing in her life right then.he was eating a piece of bread and holding a bowl of candy. Today was Holloween, Samhain, Tithe... Today her and joe would skip school and and party, maybe spend all day down by the river just talking. 
Joe looked up when she reached the bottom of the stairs, he was smiling"" hey love, what are we going to do today?"" he asked with a wink, and looked over at eva, Gin's mom"" Do you think she will notice us gone?"" 
""Does she ever?"" Joe and her had skipped thirty days of school already. ""Its only seven in the morning and shes already drinking, she'll be drunk by Eight!"" she said setteling under his arm. 
""Ah, well in that case..""he leaned in to give her a kiss. 
""Joe Wrath! get your grubby little paws off my daughter!""yelled Eva. 
Joe kisses Gin anyway and pulled back and looked at Eva grinning broadly"" Why cant i kiss her Eva? I love her."" Gin giggled and smiled shyly. 
""Because you are two years older then her and i dont like you!"" she replied 
Gin Luahged, sat up and looked at her mom""stop being a bitch mom!"" she got up and grabbed Joe's hand, ""Common."" 
""Gin if your going anywhere your going to school! i dont care if its all Hallows eve or what ever you kids call it now days and stop holding his hand!"" she took a swig of her beer and glared at Joe. 
""Go suck an egg"" Gin yelled back at her mom as she went through the front door followed by Joe who was glaring at Eva.

**************************************************************************************

They got into Joe's beat up old cadalac and drove down to the river. Stepping out of the car onto the marshy, wet ground Gin looked around. Up the riverbank she could see Liz making out with Dereick half clothed, making out. she turned the other direction and saw them. They were every little girls dream, but Gin knew what they really were. Those evil sprites that could harm as easliy as help. Their seven years of freedom from the Unseelie court ended tonight and they would do anything to keep it from ending, anything to keep their freedom for seven more years. 
Joe wrapped his arms around her waist startling her out of her thoughts ""whats wrong love?"" 
""nothin, Its just me and liz got in a fight this morning and well...yeah. Joe.. do you see them"" she asked looking over at the fey. 
""Liz and Dereick? Yeah, Why did you guys fight?"" 
""well"" she hesitated"" its because she doesnt like you and she thinks i should dump you and ...and date dereick. its all because i told her what you did last saturday...""she trailed off sadly. 
""oh really?"" he answered with a sharp edge to his voice"" i thought you like the roses. i mean the choclate kisses mught of been to much but i thought you liked them..."" 
A sharp wind blew at them from where the fey' ries were, Gin turned her head to look at them almost despretly"" Joe I did like them. I loved them! she just said it was corny and lame . But i Loved it, i love it when you do things like that for me! its waht makes you, you! and I love you so much!"" 
Hearing her friend yell Liz looked up."" Gin, Joe come on over here!"" she pulled her shirt back on and smiled at dereick."" Is that ok Dere?"" 
""yeah what ever, babe"" Dereick mumbled grumpily"" but we are going to have sex tonight. OK?!"" 
""Fine what ever.."" replied Liz 
Gin looked up at Joe and smiled sheepishly ""is that ok with you Joe?"" 
""anything you want, my love."" Joe said smiling down on her, then looking over to where liz and Dere were.""Do you want me to say anything to her about this morning?"" 
""No thats ok, I can handle her and her jelously.but yeah dont worry about it."" 
they walked down to where Liz and Dereick were sitting. Gin looked back to where the fey had been but they were no longer anywhere to be seen. 
""Hey girl!"" Liz said to gin grabbing her arm to pull her aside from the guys"" Sorry i hope you dont mind Joe, I'm just stealing her away for a moment."" Joe nodded and starting to talk to dereick. 
""what now Liz, are you gonna tell me I dont know what love is again, or belittle me, or what?"" she pulled her arm away from liz's grasp ""Well?!"" 
"" No im not. Look i can see you really do love him and im sorry about yelling this morning and all, but.. ok. Ginny Im jelous, all dereick wants is sex and i know you and joe dont do it. i dont wanna have sex every night and i want a little more. i want Joe. OK I like joe!"" Liz looked at Gin emploringly as if to make her under stand. 
Gin's eyes got wide and she stared at her best friend in horror"" What did you just say?"" she said quietly 
Liz winced and looked over to Joe nad Dereick""I'm so sorry Gin, I sent him all those love notes that you were mad about a couple weeks ago. i should of told you but... but ive like him for a long time..."" 
Gin turned around and shouted ""STOP liz just stop! you were telling me lies! LIES LIZ! how long have you been lieing to me?"" she didnt wait to hear the answer she just ran over to joe, whom had looked up when he heard he yelling and was by this time watching her. 
Joe reached his arms out to catch her as she came hurtling towards him"" Are you okay, love? what did she say to you?"" He asked huggling her close to him"" whats wrong?"" he whispered. 
""I just wanna get away from them Joe...Now...please.."" she sobbed into his chest. 
He easily picked her up in his armsand carried her toback to his car, Ignoring the stunnded look on Dereicks face and the sad on one Liz's."

As I walk through the darkness....Blinded by pain and sorrow
Beaten and Bruised...Fearing the coming morrow
I am overtaken...by a sudden burst of light
Which sends me to the ground...astounded and full of freight
As I look into the brilliant light...All I see is you
Bearing feathery wings...My sweet, dearest Meru
I cannot wait...Until the day you and I meet..
So I can hold you close...and feel your heartbeat
You are the best thing that has ever happened to me....My guardian angel...that sets me free..."

"event","so i was not going to put this in here for the fact... well yeah you'll see why 

on saturday after work this guy, whom ive known for like 7 years, started making sexual advances on me. he kept touching my brest and my legs and at one point grabbed my hand and put it on his penis. i was so frightened. i always imagened that if ever i were in that position i would like hit the guy and run. but i just froze and i didnt know what to do it was very weird and scary because at one point i serously thought he was going to do something worse. he stopped in the middle of a back road and turned off the lights and by that time i was alrdy freaked because of what he had been doing. but thank god , whom i was praying to to not let anything happen to me, he didnt do anything. 

then on sunday i went out to youth group and hung out with my friend justin whom i found that his boyfriend is dieing. i was so sad for him. 

monday i told amanda about it and she got really mad (that is about mikey assulting me) and wanted to beat him up. i guess i feel better though im never getting a ride from him ever again! justin is giving me a ride every saturday from now on. 

tommarow me andamanda are going to hang out. it'll be the first time out of scchool in months i cant wait ^^ 

i go to work at 6 today and at 4 thursday, friday. and saturday. monday im off. well thats whats happened over the last 4 days and whats going inthe future"

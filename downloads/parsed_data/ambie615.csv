He makes my life wonderful and i am so lucky to be able to call him mine. I just love that man so much. So all week we have been looking at cars online because my car was a major POS!!! if any of you have seen my car you would argree. so anyways we were looking. i found a car that i was in love with. i wanted a new baby blue hyundai accent. well i really didnt expect to get one. so Thursday when we were off work we went looking for cars. well the first car lot we pull into there it is. my 2006 baby blue ,its actually called ice blue but you get the idea, hyundai accent. God wanted me to have that car. So andy ,who is great at stretching the truth, talked the salesman down almost 3000 dollars and HE GOT ME THE CAR!!!! yay im so happy. im glad he can talk to people because i could have never talked someone down that much i would have felt bad. but it is adorable and i love it. i have never had a brand new car before. Andy is amazing. <br /><br />So my little man is growing more everyday. i love watching him do the smallest things like smile. everytime i see him smile at me my heart melts. he is a little angel. he is looking more and more like his daddy everyday. Tanner is starting to make noises now also. ya know other than crying which is a blessing to me. lol. he will just lay there and carry on a conversation with someone or himself, which ever one is listening at the time. just cooing away. it is ADORABLE. me and andy made a beautiful baby boy. Watching tanner learn and grow makes me want another baby. but we will wait awhile for that. for our sanity's sake. lol. <br /><br />Andy and i are looking for apartments. Finally!!! we are saving money and getting stuff together to get out on our own. we have been waiting for this for a long time. but we had to take care of things first. but we should be moved out by the end of august at the very latest. hopefully sooner but we are working on it. <br /><br />So there is quite alot going on in my life right now but all good things. For once i am happy. I am blessed with great people that helped me get to this point. i love them all.&nbsp; ill update again soon!! ~amber~</span></span></span></font></span>"

"event","so things in my life have taken a turn for the better. i havent updated in the longest time. alot of major things have happened. well andy(my new boyfriend) is wonderful. he treats me so good. i have never imagined that it is possible to love someone like i love him. the crazy thing is he loves me back the same way. its like he always wants me to be happy and he will do whatever it takes to make me that way. im happier than i have ever been in my entire life. His family is great and they are so sweet to me. My parents and sisters absolutely love him. He proposed to me for my birthday. It was so sweet. He did it at his house and in front of his family he asked me to marry him. we were all crying. Obviously i said YES!!! Things are wonderful.
  On other news in my life. For those of you who dont know. im pregnant. Yeah its true. And im happy about it. who would have known that this would be happening to me? im a little over three months. its the weirdest feeling to know that you have a little person growing inside you. but its awesome. i have already had to get an ultrasound but i dont know what im having yet. hearing your baby's heartbeat for the first time is the most amazing and overwhelming feeling you will ever experience. its exciting!
  I miss michael. he went back to school in september and me and kami miss him soooo much! i hope everything is good with him. i love you michael!!!!
  well that is really about it for now. ill try to update more often. And shana if you read this i just want you to know that i love you sweetie and you and your family are in my prayers! ~amber~

"event","""Stay""

you say i only hear what i want to.
you say i talk so all the time so.

and i thought what i felt was simple,
and i thought that i don't belong,
and now that i am leaving,
now i know that i did something wrong 'cause i missed you.
yeah, i missed you.

and you say i only hear what i want to:
i don't listen hard,
i don't pay attention to the distance that you're running
or to anyone, anywhere,
i don't understand if you really care,
i'm only hearing negative: no, no, no.

so i turned the radio on, i turned the radio up,
and this woman was singing my song:
the lover's in love, and the other's run away,
the lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay.

some of us hover when we weep for the other who was
dying since the day they were born.
well, this is not that:
i think that i'm throwing, but i'm thrown.

and i thought I'd live forever, but now i'm not so sure.

you try to tell me that i'm clever,
but that won't take me anyhow, or anywhere with you.

you said that i was naive,
and i thought that i was strong.
i thought, ""hey, i can leave, i can leave.""
but now i know that i was wrong, 'cause i missed you.

you said, ""you caught you 'cause you want me and one day you'll let me go.""
""you try to give away a keeper, or keep me 'cause you know you're just scared to lose.
and you say, ""stay.""

you say i only hear what i want to.



I hope things get resolved! You two need each other more than you will ever know! Friendship is one of the most valuable things you will ever have in life! The friendship you two shared was amazing! ~amber~"

"event","Prom is so close. I am personally very excited. This is my first prom! I love my dress and Nick's Tux! i dunno, things are so much better. It feels like i have alot lifted off of me! I was really mean and bitchy for awhile but i feel better. But Seniors have less than thirty days! YIPPEE! I am so ready for summer! 

I have something to say to a certain someone who reads these lj's. You should get over yourself! First lie, you tell your best friend that the guy she likes doesn't like her! Then when she finally gets to be with him, you tell her that he flirts with you! WRONG! He doesn't want you. You need to let her have the chance to be happy instead of trying to take the guys she likes away. You are seriously a horrible friend! and if i were her i would do whatever i could to make you as miserable as you try to make her!

So guys i am having a great day! I am a bit burnt from the tanning bed but other than that i am great great great! ~amber~"

Friends are turning against each other and let me add that these are ""best"" friends. If you are such a great friend then why try to bring everyone down. When one of your best friends has found someone who they can be comfortable with and feel that they like, why must you try to bring down their happiness. You don't know anything about the way the other person feels. Is it because you are jealous and feel bad about yourself so everyone around you must be as depressed as you are. What kind of friend are you? And about this exposed situation. If you didn't want anyone to know, then maybe you should have <FONT size=4>kept your mouth shut</FONT>!

I mean eventually we will all move on and leave this all behind and truthfully I don't think any of us are 100% ready to face what lies ahead. It seems as if we can't get out of high school fast enough but I will miss all these days that I spend with the people that make me so happy. I will miss those crazy people like Heather. That girl can make me laugh more than anyone else in my life. So I'm not sure if i'm ready for graduation.:(!</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc><STRONG>&nbsp;Any ways on a happier note. I think that Nicholas and I are going to make it. There for a while things seemed as if we were getting no where. Four years together and just here recently things seemed to take a turn for the worst. He got in a great habit of lying about everything. And I mean EVERYTHING! So now he is trying to get my trust again. It was very hard to give it to him in the first place so I honestly think it will be even harder to fully trust him again. I no longer worry about the possibility of another girl so that is a step in the right direction.:)</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc><STRONG>&nbsp;I have an update on my prom dress. I have found three or four that I really like therefore my mother is taking me to get one next weekend! I am so happy.

well yesterday was joey's funeral. it was heart breaking! so many people loved him. there where like over a hundred cars driving to the grave yard after the viewing was over.

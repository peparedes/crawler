At the ""Quick 'n' Snack"" on the morning of Friday, January 28th, a local man had a bout of what is described by poilce, as ATM Rage.  A phenomenah that has been gaining steam in areas with overpriced ATM charges, ATM Rage is the result of people attempting to withdraw cash only to be charged high prices (usually in excess of $3) for doing so.
Says shopkeeper Vladimir Nostevic about the occurrence, ""It was really quite odd.  I've seen [Jack Starks] come into the store many times before and we were on a first-name basis.  I don't think anything of his coming in and suddenly I hear this shouting.  He accusing me of ripping him off.  He says is that the way I treat customers.  Then he electrocutes himself.""
Jack Starks, a 32 year-old schoolteacher originally from Boise, Idaho is currently listed in critical condition at the Good Samaritan hospital here in Pensacola.  Though officials have not yet released details from the security tape, eye-witnesses described Starks' as first growing very irate, then without thinking, pulling down his pants and urinating on the machine.

"event","She takes a bite of the Medium Rare Kobe steak, perfectly cooked.  Juices dribble down her chin.
<i>I should get an Ocsar for this</i>
Her stomach churns, her gag reflex steadies and she chokes down the barely chewed chuck of flesh, maintaining a smile and , with a napkin applied to blot the grease, her dignity.  This isn't the toughest assignment she's ever been on.  She's been called upon to eat meat in the past, but it never shakes the discomfort associated with the task.
She stares across the table at the mound of human garbage that is her target.  Dr. Phillip Waston (yes, Waston), President of Waston meats, takes bite after bite of his steak, chewing it slowly and savoring the flavors in a manner that repulses her even further.  Her eyes focus on what seems like an entire calf wedged between his front teeth.  Every sound of chewing or swallowing eminating from his turns him further into the swine she imagines him to be.
She hopes this will be her last assignment.  She's received no such promise, but the opportunity for promotion is there and she has no competition should a promotion take place.  But in a few hours, when she kills Dr. Waston (his doctorate in business, his dissertation on beef sales turning a few fence vegetarians on the committee into all-out carnivores), she will disappear into the night and take her charter flight back to her base in Rhode Island.

Imelda Gratis is an agent for the Society of Underground Vegans and has been trained in highly covert and deadly operations associated with her employers.  A vegan herself, Imelda is a true supporter of the cause and not just a hired gun, although the SUVs have been known to hire mercenaries from time to time.  
Imelda has been involved in 12 operations in all, 4 as the point operative.  Her success rate is extremely high, with 10/12 successful targets downed and 4/4 where shen was point.  She's looking to retire as a field operative with a perfect 5/5 tonight.
This evening's target, Dr. Waston, is an especially large thorn in the side of the SUVs.  He's exceedingly wealthy, very intelligent, exceedingly handsome and has a flair for public speaking, besides being well-written to boot.  He has been targetted by SUV nearly a half-dozen times, all of which have failed.  He has put up security that he consdiders infallible and no doubt has one or two agents working from within the SUV.  Whenever he entertains women, he orders meat for them and if they do not eat it, his guards will see her out of the restaurant very quickly.  
Preparing for this endeavor wasn't easy for Imelda.  Normally a thin woman who wears very comfortable clothes, she had to somehow transform into somebody a bit more 'meaty' as she liked to say.  Breast implants and ass implants were received as well as various injections and treatments in the arms, chest, neck, face and legs to give the full appearance of a woman with a so-called healthy build, the kind of woman Dr. Waston would never suspect.  The preparation for this job took 7 months. 

The meal now over, she pushed away the remainder of her steak (not wanting to appear too overzealous by devouring the whole thing) and gave Dr. Waston the look that she had been trained to give.  The look that told the tale of what would happen not an hour later, which would hopefully end with the two alone and give her the chance to complete her task.
The hour passed.  Both Dr. Waston and Ms. Gratis were naked and in a sleepy, post-coitus state.  They smiled, kissed.  Dr. Waston snoozed.  She pulled a sharpened pencil from her purse, the only deadly weapon she would have been able to bring into the house.  One quick puncture into the throat and that would be that... no screaming, no struggle.  
Finding the pencil in her purse, she had a shakiness in her arms.  She broke out into a cold sweat and her stomach gurgled with hunger.  
<i>I'm hungry?  for...</i>
""I'm hungry for...     For...                                             It can't be.""
""It is.""
She spun around to see Dr. Waston up on one elbow, his winning smile glowing at her.  
""Imelda Gratis.  You want meat.  You are hungry for meat right now.""
""How is that possible, how did you know... how did...?""
""You can put the pencil down, it won't be very useful right now.  We've known from the start, Imelda.  From the very start.""

"event","A very fast human being set herself up at the blocks.  She got into her stance, lowering her head.  A quick glance ensured that the finish line was 100m away and there was nothing else in existence.  The path from here to there was a clear and straight line, there would be nothing in the way.

The gun shot off and she closed her eyes, still seeing the finish line getting ever closer with each passing second.  Until 10 seconds passed, then 20, then 30.  Her eyes open once more, she noticed that she was running as fast as she had thought, as fast as she'd ever run in her life.  Her lungs were burning.  The finish line was gone.

The desert floor was cracked and dry.  Her sweat would fall, land on a brick of dirt and crack it even further with the sudden moisture.  Her feet, clad in sole-defining slippers outlined in fine rubber crunched with each step.  A tumbleweed caught up to and passed her.  She slowed down.  Her legs, as always, began to tighten up severely.  Her lungs burned even worse, especially with no water bottle at the ready like usual.  Her competitors were nowhere to be seen.  She continued to walk to keep her legs moving, to keep them from becoming useless gnarled lumps of fiber tissue.

When she reached the foothills leading to the mountain she stopped and looked back.  There was no sign of the race, no sign of humanity.  

She began to see clusters of show on the ground.  She had climbed much of the mountain, her hands dirty, bleeding.  Her shoes showing signs of being shredded by the terrain.  The wind had picked up and the temperature had fallen drastically.  Night was well on it's way and she was at a much higher elevation than before.  She wondered when the scenery, her surroundings had changed so much without her noticing.  It seems like only moments ago that she was fighting off dehydration, fighting off the dry heaves, fighting to remain conscious.  She wonderous if she did remain conscious.  Now, her limbs feel like they are in vice grips and the vice is forever turning, putting pressure on her bones and tendons.  She can barely will her legs to move.  Her knees have swelled up to the size of grapefruits, her ankles red, with golf balls inside.

On the other side of the mountain a dense rainforest.  Her movements appeared as if she wore fully starched clothes, frostbite had almost taken over some of her extremeties, but she managed to continue to move.  In her minds eye all she saw was the finish line.  All that existed for her was the tape at the end.  As she stepped through the rainforest, evading its dangers, into the swaplands, making her way through the pain, the agony she continued to see nothing but the end.

And there, just around the bend... there was the stadium.  Hobbling into the stadium, there was the track.  Onto the track there was her lane.  Now in her lane, she arrived once again at the start and kept walking.  The snap of the tape around her waist caused her to stop.  Her body seized, her trainers running to her.  She's carted away.  

Her passing turned her immortal.  She became one of the great goddesses, one of willpower, one of fierce nobility.  Her statue is adorned with her mortal achievements, but represents better her immortal ones, and she continues to run."

The Frenchman was making no sense.  I nodded to the barkeep for another cup of poison.
""Thierry Ventuvre.""
He tapped my shoulder. 
I sighed.
I thanked the bartender.
I imbibed my beverage which stung, surprisingly, on the way down.
I turned to look at the Frenchman.
(Now, I will not attempt to make into words the thick accent with which he spoke, but the Frenchman was both difficult to understand and to comprehend, which made the conversation somewhat laborious.  I've editted out all of the fluff and highly awkward statements.)
""Thierry Ventuvre.""
""You must have me mistaken, friend.  That is not my name.  Now if you please.""
I nodded for another shot.
""No, it is you who are mistaken."" (Remember, very thick, very French accent)
I turned to him again, beginning to feel my eyes glaze over a bit.
""You are seeking Thierry Ventuvre.  You desire to see him, yes?""
""I'm afraid not.  I really think you have me mistaken for another.  Good night, friend.""
My drink arrives, the Frenchman pays for it... with Japanese yen.  The barkeep appears to have both expected and accepted the coinage.  Where am I?
""But Mr. Ventuvre is most certainly expecting you, whomever you are.  And you desire to see him.""
Another drink taken care of, another ordered.
""Look my dear fellow, the only person I desire to see has two big boobs and a great set of lowered expectations.  If I'm lucky, maybe both will be sitting soon in place of your esteemed self.""
""That can wait.  Believe me, you don't want to ignore a calling by Mr. Ventuvre.""
""And just who is Mr. Bentoother and why would I want to see him?"" (I don't recall, but I think by this point I was rather intoxicated)
""Why, Mr. Ventuvre is an amazing gentleman of high esteem.  He is well traveled and well educated.  He is known in many scientific and political circles.""
""So why'd he want to see me?""
""He owes you a debt.  Don't you remember?  Don't you wish to collect?""
At that point, realizing that there were no breasts near me and chances were there wouldn't be for some time, I set down my (5th? 6th? 10th?) and followed the Frenchman out the door, changing my then inane life forever."

"event","""You cannot get to where you're going from here.  First you've got to get out of the forest, then you'll be able to make towards your destination.""
Each time I saw the troupe he would say that.  Perhaps we would perform first or afterwards, but the consistency was that the leader would approach me and say those words.  
I loved our run-ins, which were often, yet sometimes not so.  Our paths were always different, but the paths in the forest were very much intertwined.  When I would meet up with the troupe, I would greet each one with a great hug, as if we'd not seen one another in years and unless one or the other was in some great hurry, they'd perform for me, and I would join in.  
The performances were always unique, yet inspired.  They were tragic, funny, sexy, serious.  Some had a point, others were without.  But each time we played together and each time we met up, the leader of the troupe would say his words with a more grave and serious tone.  
""You hear me not.  Your head is thick.  Leave here to arrive there, that is the way you must go.""
""That's not the way others take.""
""But this way is yours, and it is the best way.""
They left and I did not see them for some time.  I was walking down a path that seemed very familiar to me, which wasn't terribly out of the ordinary when my heart grew light.  I heard in the distance the sounds of wagon wheels and horse hooves and the racous sounds of my troupe.  I hurried a bit faster to meet them.  When the leader's eyes fell upon me the horses stopped, the wagon creaked and my friend's suddenly silent voices echoed to their death in the woods around us.
The troupe leader suddenly flew into rage, ""YOU'VE BEEN GOING NOWHERE.  YOU'VE DONE NOTHING.  YOU'VE HEARD ME NOT ONCE IN ALL THE TIME I'VE KNOWN YOU!""
He grabbed my hair in his fist and yanked me a dozen yards towards a particular path.
""GO THAT WAY.  SEE US NOT AGAIN, FOR IF YOU SEE US BUT ONCE MORE YOU SHALL EVER BECOME ONE OF US.""
""But why,"" I managed with a sob in my throat, ""would that be so bad?""
His head leaned into mine, a tear crawled slowly down his cheek.  His breath warmed my ear as his spoke in the gentlest of whispers, ""That is for you to find out one way or the other, it is not for me to tell you.  Now go."""

"event","As I sat down at the empty table I noticed that the silverware was placed upon the other side, slightly askew.  It's location was obviously a command to sit there and my not doing so had brought a bit of chaos into a universe already filled with it.  When the second set of silverware was brought to me, the initial set was rendered not only useless in the immediate instance, but all of its previous actions leading up to that point were futile and, in fact, nonexistant.  

It's tough to really measure the desparity emmiting from a knife and fork, regardless of their proximity.  In this circumstance, however, the desparity was so immense and the sadness and depression so focused that it took on the tangible form of a woman sitting across from me.  Her form was not perfect, and much of her was falling apart, but I paid for her meal anyway, which she partially ate without thanks.  

I left her there as picking her up would lead to her own demise as the knife and fork from whence she sprang no longer despaired enough to keep her together."

"event","As a two-dimensional representation of a cloud of dust spins about a constantly moving radius, the viewer notices things for what they are.  The image of the galaxy in space becomes an entity that exists within a ring of dust and within that ring of dust is cloud of dust similar to that represented in the image.  The spinning image appears as a window to the reality behind it, but the reality itself is truly so far away that it's impossible to discern its true dimensionality.  

In fact, the reality of the image beomes a more solid one than that of the galaxy itself.  Even when placed within the galaxy, the dust becomes more than itself.  The dust undergoes a transformation such that the galaxy no longer exists, only the pieces within.

Tearing the paper in half diminishes the reality of the image as the only true destruction comes about upon the paper, not the concept.  Tearing the paper further creates a new reality as the paper becomes dust. 

But this is meaningless.

Gordon Wreath, the man tearing the piece of paper into shreds, is realizing all of this and further realizing that his photograph is as meaningless as the imagery of the astronomical wonder that he had only recently discovered and photographed using a series of orbiting telescopes.  GW-13 is the newest galaxy on the charts and has made consideralbe headlines within scientific circles.  

Drunk and depressed, galaxian confetti at his feet, a newly discovered galaxy floating some considerable number of miles above his head.  What further depresses Gordon is that the galaxy will not be floating any number of miles above his head in another couple hours, it will be beneath him or in front of or behind him.  But what of earth, what's the relation of this new galaxy to earth?  Gordon and his team are working on that problem.  Is GW-13 in the same cluster as the Milky Way?  Is GW-13 in a neighboring cluster?  Where is GW-13 at this exact moment, certainly not remotely in the same spot it was in upon its discovery.

But this, too, is meaningless.

Gordon tore up his photograph with the vision of the true galaxy fresh in his mind.  ""This piece of paper cannot possibly relate the grandeur of the universe!""  

The irony of that statement is the same irony that has Gordon Stewart Wreath in an inebriated and depressed state at the moment.  It's the same thing that subconciously caused him to snap not an hour earlier as he reduced his photograph to so much confetti.  No, the piece of paper cannot possibly relate the gradeur of the universe... but neither can he.  

--------------

When presenting his findings to the press the week following the discovery of GW-13, Professor Gordon Wreath seemed ""out of sorts,"" to quote one of his colleagues, Professor R. Schwartz.  ""He wasn't himself,"" Dr. Schwartz continued, ""it was as if he were ill or had been suffering some bad bouts of insomnia, neither of which has been apparent to me until the morning he was to be speaking to the press, something he has done before without problem.""

Whether there was anything significant to those words or whether there was any true malady will not be known.  Shortly after speaking to the press, Dr. Gordon Wreath was found having slit his wrists.  A small note was found with the doctor's indecipherable scribble on it.  ""Nobody has ever been able to read his writing,"" his colleague said."

"event","I had just shined my black loafers and was walking, otherwise naked, through the uninhabited mall.  This was a kind of tradition for me regarding ringing in the new year.  When I was a kid, I wasn't naked and I wasn't wearing shoes, but we all develop certain eccentricities as we age.  But getting back to the point, I've always loved the reverberation of walking through this place.  Tap tap tap tap tap tap.  It's truly gorgeous.  The shops are, of course, closed and locked down, but it's not the shops I'm there for.  

Tap tap tap tap tap.  The rain outside is starting, something that has happened only a couple of years in the 40-odd times I've done this in my life.  The very slight pittering noise that the rain adds to the overall sensory experience that I'm having sends me into a bit of an overload.  The gooseflesh that crawls up my arms and the back of my neck seems to come seconds before a layer of coolness that blankets down upon me.  

I look downwards from the top level of the mall as I look upwards towards that same spot from below, sitting on a chilly bench.  My breath becomes visible to me as I inhale deeply and exhale.  My shiny shoes tapping sharply on the tile right, left, right and my next left steps on a carpeted area.  The difference in sounds strikes my plane of thought in twain.  Where was I?

I sit down on a comfortable chair.

I am on the centre level passing the elevator.  The elevator is stuck between floors.  I have walked miles.

Small bits of food fly out of their mouths when a spark of intelligence about to be consumed by the stench of alcohol should happen upon a particularly good joke to recite.  The lowest of political philosophy and the rote rehearsal of opinionated editorials eminates from their mouths when the whim of a gag is not within reach.

So gouged are these men into the foundation of this establishment that the barstools themselves cannot be sat in by anyone else as their buttocks are quite chiseled into the sitting structures.  Braggarts of years long since passed, creative visionaries when called upon to describe their current lives, their future is seen through beer-goggles and the apparition is frightening enough to keep them glued in place.

The lights in their eyes slowly go out with those of the restaurant as the scratchy sounds of silent sweeping are followed by loud locking of the doors for the night.

I open my umbrella just as the rain patters against it.  It's my skill in life you know, I like to think of it as my unique superpower.  Heh, I know it's not much, but it's mine and I'm proud of it.  Of course I use my power for good, why just the other day I sprinted twenty yards to keep the rain off of an elderly woman and her grandchild.  She was so very nice, I just ended up giving her my own umbrella, I always keep a spare handy.

Now that superpower, as fun as it is just isn't anything compared to the superpower of that man over there.  Now, I took a solemn oath that I would never tell what it is to anybody living or dead.  I plan to keep that promise.  No, I'm not afraid of what he'll do to me, he's far too nice a gentleman to do anything but forgive, but you see, I respect his wishes.  These days, I suppose that's another superpower I have, but I know others out there have it as well, even if they don't know it themselves.

But let me tell you some things about that guy's power.  Now, like I said, no detail will be given, but if you were to pass him on the street you'd say that he was a fairly ordinary chap.  He bumbles about a lot, he seems distracted sometimes, like he's got the ADD or something.  Let me assure you, that's not the case.  Let me assure you he's paying as much attention as anybody could.

That is not his super-power, mind you, just something about his personality that might make you aware of his superpower if you were to spend enough time with him, which is unlikely.  Oh, don't get me wrong, he won't bore of you, nothing of the sort.  He'll listen to everything you say with great interest and maybe even have something interesting to say in return.  But, the chances are that you'll leave at some point and won't think of him again.  He's told me he thinks it's a sad part of his life, but it's a fact.  He smiles all the same, awaiting each new day which represents another possibility that he'll get to use his power for the greater good."

His computer, paid.  His monthy porn bills, paid.  Automation had allowed this greasy man to live on his own without any help.  The penultimate domesticated man.  His hand and a million chat-room friends his only comfort.  

May I come in, Mr. Jenkins?

I'm tellin' ya, lady, you got the wrong guy.  

Fast as lighting (she had the fasted draw in the west) her hand flew out of her purse.  The poor guy didn't stand a chance.  Are ya ready boots?  She laughed to herself again.

The well-placed kick, sending a screeching and crying Mr. Jenkins to the floor, also served to open the door enough to let her in.  The dogs she had heard were beginning to hump her leg as she walked thorugh the spotless house.  This place was clean in a way few other places are.  He must jerk off in a specific place, that sicko.  

------

Three hours later, with 2 grand in her hand and Jenkins' car in what people refer to as a chop-shop, she would begin to plan her evening at home with her completely normal husband and kids, although she worried that they lived in a world with probably thousands of men like Jenkins."

"event","After several millenia, then many thousand more, a monkey came into the universe of infitie typewriters and began his work.  Unknowingly, of course, it created the works of Rudyard Kipling (not in sequential order, but who's counting) and signed all of them (completely randomly) -- E. E. Boffo.  The grand monkey Boffo continued its great work, churning out sheet after sheet of replica-perfect material, including the typo on page 132 of the English translation of Italo Calvino's 'If on a Winter's Night a Traveller'.  700 texts were completed in this time, more classics than any human in history had ever written, but nary a single page of the hypothetical Shakespeare was to be seen.  

Then, one fine morning, as the sun rose in the east over the hills and mountains of infinite monkeys sitting around typewriters, the incredible E E Boffo began a new literary work.  The philosophers in the sky grew highly anticipartory of what might happen for, you see, as the day progressed it became quite obvious that the great Boffo was dealing with the first Act of Hamlet.  

The sun, now was going down and the second Act was just concluding.  The iambic pentameter was flawless and the mathematicians were absolutely fainting at the numerical odds that this monkey represented.  Seriously, don't try to think about it unless you have some Advil handy.  Morning came again and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern ""rest their souls"" were just pronounced as having passed on when... E E Boffo reached gently down, unravelled the tape from the typewriter and began to eat it.  

Soon after, the term apeshit reached new meaning as the first of an infinite number of typewriters was hurled across the meadow and blood was spilt.  And because there was an infinite number of monkeys here, Pay Per View was making a mint.  What had started out as a relatively small article of interest in a Philosophy journal had turned into the cover story of Maxim magazine.  Scantily clad women wearing wet T-Shits that proudly displayed the Budweiser logo were parading in front of the pit of monkeys that was becoming an infinite collection of flesh-ridden bone and the spine-tingling screeches of completely mad primates.

I'll leave you with the image as I don't feel up to tying the end around this one just yet."

Age: 21 years
Buffalo, NY 

This memorial to Trevor was created by his brother, Rich Keel. 

Trevor was shot and killed on April 8, 1993 in Buffalo, NY. Most of the ""whos and whys"" are not known. Originally, the police thought that he had to be on crack and that he was downtown to buy or sell drugs. The fact is that when he was killed, he had only $13.00 in his pocket. Trevor also had no drugs on him, and an autopsy showed his system was clean. 

He went to college at the University of Buffalo where many of his friends were blacks and lived in the inner-city. This is probably why he was there. Many people think that because he was white he should not have had these friends and what did he expect would happen? Racial reconciliation was important to him and he went out of his way to do something about it. His life was not in vain if it becomes a 'wake up call' for people to build friendships across racial lines so that one day the evil of racism will end.

His final thoughts, unfortunately, were clouded out by an annoying song he'd heard on the radio that morning.  The same introductory lyrics over and over and over again.  Then, his lips quivered into an ironic smile and he passed on."

If you haven't read this thing yet, please do.  I'd equate my experience to reading this to a fictitious experience of reading the rules to baseball and finding that there shouldn't be a bat involved at all.  We've been doing it wrong all these years.  Those founding fathers were smart people (based on what I've read), and I think we should feel incredibly idiotic by comparison in our modern age, regardless of how much we've advanced scientifically or how good that guy did on Jeopardy."

"event","There was a great battle fought in these trenches some 24 years ago.  The annual chocolate festival was held and nobody knew, at that time, that next to the milk chocolate, caramel and nougat there would run velvety rivulets of dark sugary blood.  
The day was October the 11th and the place was, as you know, the fairgrounds near here.  Every year the best confectionairies in the world would gather to show off their wares and bring the latest delicious delights to the people of Grantanoville.  One subject of annual question, however, was the allowance of what is popularly known from Reece's as the peanut-butter cup.  Peanut Butter and Chocolate, a match made in heaven for many.  But for some it was the very definition of Hell.

The AAPBC (Alliance Against Peanut Butter with Chocolate) were the most violent protestors to this abomination of tasty creations.  The PAPB (People Allergic to Peanut Butter) just thought of peanut-butter cups as little disguised messengers of death.  The very small group PHCLPB (People who Hate Chocolate but Love Peanut Butter) thought the whole idea nauseating.  Lastly the PBC squared (People for the Blessed Consumption of Peanut Butter Cups) basically disagreed with all of these aforementioned people.  

Each year the PBC squared housed a slot near the Reece's display, handing out flyers promoting the greatness of this beloved marriage while the AAPBC constantly pickets these actions.  The PAPB are generally nowhere in this area while the PHCLPB are never present simply because they're busy preparing for the annual Peanut Butter Convention in the next county.  

This particular year, however, the AAPBC were more active than usual.  Their newly appointed leader, Gustaf Jimenez, had been busy all year speaking not against the peanut butter cup (which is odd, as that's his job), but allying himself with the PAPB and the PHCLPB.  Now, it was easy to win over both of the members from the latter, but the former took some persuasion.  ""No, you'll not have to handle peanut butter, no, there won't be any enclosed spaces in which you'll be near peanut butter and no I'm not just saying this so you'll join."" (he was)

On this fateful day, the army of 35 attacked and fought the PBC-squared comprised of 14 people (minus 5 who couldn't attend this year) and beat them savagely with whatever was handy: chocolate bars, chocolate bunnies, chocolate tire irons.  Fortunately for them, although they were looked down upon by the Reese's folk, they were also accepted as family (the unfortunately ugly step-cousin, but family nevertheless) and the 250 members of Reese's beat the ever-loving crap out of the bizarre alliance.

It went down as the ugliest display of chocolate battery in the history of mankind as every member of all four groups were hospitalized and all but one of the members of the PAPB died because they were allergic to peanut butter.  The other was the founding member's mother and she sued the holy snot out of Reese's.  She then appeared on countless public access talk shows and made an appearance on The Price is Right, even though she never got on stage (she had no gift for knowing the costs of various items).

The moral of this story is... well, don't be allergic to stuff.

The End"

"event","Zipping through the cosmos with a fish taco in one-hand and checking for radio signal with the other, I steer cautiously with my knees as my interstellar transport veers to the starboard.  As some tarter'n'cabbage falls down the crack between the cup-holder and my seat, I wonder about the glorious collection of food items stuck in that particular spot.  Defintiely some insect or parasite with an entrepenurial spirit is starting an all-you-can-ingest buffet while a spider waits nearby for the easy prey of a recently-fattened fly for hasty eating.

I pass some 'roadkill' in the middle of space and it occurs to me that roadkill really shouldn't be possible in space, expecially with regards to the tire-treads on the back of that poor creature.  Not bloody likely to happen in space.  My knees jerk to the right to avoid the deceased animal, even though I recall in the Space Driving Guide that you shouldn't make such jerky movements at speeds in excess of Warp .25.

I find a station that has something intelligible on it and it isn't country music, so I listen, if only to have something besides my own blaring thoughts ricocheting around my cabin with me.  Hotel California comes on and I begin snapping out the beat on my steering wheel (fish taco eaten and radio station found) until I realize what I'm doing, then I turn off the station.  

With the phrase, ""Such a lovely place,"" repeatedly bounding in my thoughts without end, I flip the radio back on and attempt to find some sporting event to listen to or perhaps some talk radio show to complain about.  Unfortunately I can't find any sports and the only talk radio I could find reminded me why it was banned on three planets and should have been banned on more.  

I sigh to myself and look around at the scenery.  The rings of some backwater planet, a gorgeus hick-moon, and a tranquility that reminds me that everything really is alright in the universe, even if nothing seems to be."

"event","""We are so fortunate that God has blessed this nation with such a great military.""

I was driving in my car when I heard this statement.  The obnoxious DJ and the kiss-up caller were complimenting each other on their tremendous national pride when this statement came over the air waves.  I wasn't talking at the time, yet I was rendered speechless.

The world slowed down for a moment and I began to see cartoon characters playing hopscotch in my speedometer.  I glaced in my rear-view mirron and saw my head collapsing.  I had heard of such things, but I was here and now experiencing a complete logical breakdown.  The very fundamentals of physics had been disturbed.  Though it was only a matter of time before things were brought to order, like the aftermath of some great national disaster, I would have to endure the next few moments without complaint.  

It was at that thought that my shin hair started an argument with the lines on the freeway, which had morphed into collosal green penguins without beaks.  I was embarrassed that any part of me would start trouble at a time like this, so I grabbed a alowly spinning parabolic shape (it was attempting to spin fast enough to create a bowl shape, but couldn't figure out the exact formulae to pull off such a complicated maneuver sans physical law) and gagged on the fumes of it's exhaust.  The scent of fresh vanilla bean filled my car/kidney as waves of sound bust my ear drums into confetti of lard.  

The scream of one thousand unborn babies called out to me as all the light in the universe extinguished and then exploded under extremely controlled circumstances.  The physical laws were coming back into being and so was my mind.  The radio was muffled by a station competing for the same frequency, an obvious Band-Aid tactic to prevent future breakdowns from that same source.  

This story was based upon real events."

""I'll sit in the sun while you're in the shade
We'll see who dies first, and the deal, it is,
The only sun tan lotion to use is cheeze whiz.""

The lobbyist turned a bright color red
Glared at the wily old coot, then he said
""I'll choke long before I die in the shade
Because of your type who's long had it made
You think you can bully and push us around
But the fact is that you're all just plain hounds.""

""I think that the truth is we're both quite the same
You have your false pride while I have false shame,
The fact is we both earn a lot of fat dough,
And we both in offices with streets down below,
And we both claim to konw the trusths of all beings,
But the fact is we drink coffee with way to much cream.""

""I know what you're saying, you fat gross bufoon,
And before your head swells like a big ol' balloon,
Let me just say that though you are right
That doesn't mean that I will not fight
To get all the money I think I deserve
While making you look like a piece of shit perv.""

And so the two men kept rattling on
Until something happened just before dawn,
Droning and droning the spoke without cease
When the logic between them caused a large crease,
A rift in the world, to some other universe,
They both got sucked in, and thus ends this verse."

"event","With the live grenade rolling to my foot and nowhere to escape I have a great deal to contemplate in not very much time.  For instance, the second the detonation occurs, my feet and legs will be compltely useless.  Chances are, my upper body, arms and head will follow quickly after that, but who really cares. 

What have I accomplished, exactly?  There was that time in Des Moines when I felt up that waitress at the club.  She was hot and didn't seem to mind, so that was pretty cool.  We had sex a few times when she got off work.  I also remember being somewhere in Albequerque during the Winter months.  I walked along the streets there and saw a great classic car.  I don't know the make or model, but it looked pretty sweet.

Going further back to my school years (even though I didn't graduate), I recall a few block parties, a few frat keggers, too much unprotected sex, a lot of class ditching and I had a job on occasion.  I remember eating mostly cafeteria food and ramen.  

So, where's this story going, exactly.  Well, since I'm about to die, I'm guessing it's more of an autobiography than anything.  I've never written anything, so I suppose it's not a very good autobiography.  I'm also not exactly writing it so much as thinking it.  

A funny thought is that I always used to laugh when watching a movie and the guy about to die would piss himself.  Well, when it happens to yourself, it's not so funny.  Well, I did chuckle a bit, but more out of irony than anything.  Damn, I wish I could've held on to that waitress chick.  She was nice.  I think she got sick of me not doing anything but fucking her.  I can see that, it could get boring for a chick, I guess. 

So, here I am.  I'm just waiting for this thing to go off.  Time to die.  Anytime now.  Let's go here."

That being known now and forever remembered in the course of human history via this wonderful invention, I continue.

It all began a few weeks ago when the car horn was stuck as I was driving the freeway in search of somewhere to eat.  Someone who apparently was into fishing nodded their approval at me as I took an exit towards one of my favoirte establishments which served beef casserole.  Not many restaurants serve beef casserole, or any casserole.  For some reason, the art of the casserole has been put upon various family members and not upon those establishments that might offer one a wine list or selection of one of their delightful desserts after a meal might have been had.

That notwithstanding, I completed my casserole and once again started up my car and horn along with it.  I took the leisurely route home as I'm wont to do from time to time if the pressures of life are attacking me from all sides.

But I digress."

Tonight, I set down with a cold Hefeweizen and a tray of Kung Pao Nachos.  If you haven't had Kung Pao Nachos, just go to the location that serves them as their specialty: Kunachos, which is off the Interstate Caddy Corner to Rugburns.  

The film I sat down to watch was some German piece: Shuan: der film.  It seemed to be some kind of meandering gibberish that looked to be a drama bit that just ended up being somewhat funny.

Well, now that that's out of the way, Shaun, thanks for the DVD.  Damn, it was funny and awful at the same time.  I watched it wihtout the commentary then with the commentary and I've got to say that I was thinking the same thoughts about 'That's Entertainment' as you were saying.  Damn that was awful,.  There were many great old bits that I remember from times of old.  Most not involving myself, but nonetheless hilarious.  Oh yeah, and I had actually completely forgotten about the piece about Dr. Snohefaus and the Tootsie Pop.  Good to know that I once attempted to fit 2 Jawbreakers in my mouth at once.

The walls, ceiling and floor are flat and white.  The man walks over to the chair and stands, contemplating it.  The door begins to disappear, leaving only a flat wall, but the man does not pay any attention, he already knows of this.  He looks at the chair for a very long time, the only motion in the room are his thoughts, thoughts nobody but he knows.  His eyes are ablaze, they begin to water and several tears are squeezed out of them and onto the chair.  The wood quickly soaks the tears in, many slaty deposits have been left here before.

"event","Where did this guy come from?

Grabanik Molanski, age 42, had spent his entire career on the bench.  He played maybe 2 complete games if you combined all the very sporadic minutes of playing time he got.  He never complained.  Not once.  He accepted his role, which was to make the stars better and he did that.  By running the plays to perfection in practice, by being a defensive monster, by knowing the plays better than anybody he became an essential tool to the coach.  He paid attention.  He watched.  When he talked to his friends, his fellow teammates, he understood them.  He wanted to know them truly and deeply.  

So when he became the team's head coach last year, it was no surprise to anybody around here.  He received a team nobody wanted, yes, but he worked with them.  His first season was by no means perfect, but certainly not a season to laugh at.  Better men than him had suffered through worse seasons, he'd often say.  

And so his career went.  Several years passed and the fans were getting restless.  We've not had a championship in years, they dais.  Not to worry, he said, not to worry.  We'll have your head, they said.  I've got things under control, he said.  You have one year, the owner said.  Make it happen.  Sir, he said, with much respect, I'll win your chamionship for you this year, but if I do that it's the only championship you'll win for another ten I can guarantee.  If you give me two more years, I'll have a streak of winning such as you've never before seen.

The owner, being of sound judgment, after all he worked hard for every penny he got, he knew the value inherent in patience. The owner hesitantly said, Ok.  The owner said, by God if you fail, I'll have your head.  I'll gift wrap it for you myself if I cannot deliver, the coach said.

Two years went by and the young players grew strong and the old players grew wise.  The team had sustained injuries and breakdowns and had come back all the better and all the smarter.  The year of the championship was upon them and all of them knew that they would win.  They weren't the best or most atheletic, but they were the most ready and knew how to do it.  They won all of the games they were supposed to and got into the playoffs in a respectable position.  They didn't waste any of the energy they all knew they would need and over the course of a year, that's a hard thing to do.  They entered the playoffs on a streak the likes of which no one had every seen.  They began winning effortlessly.  While the other teams were tired, they were fresh, when the other teams were playing on emotion, they were playing with their feet on the ground.  When the opposition wanted their blood, they  mercilessly slaughtered them.  

The playoffs were not fun to watch because the coach and the team so dominated.  The owner was happy.  He said, how long will this last?  Until I die, the coach replied, but I'll find you a sucsessor when I go."

"event","The entertainer stopped.  He looked out at the audience.  It, of course, was empty but for one person.  The performer wasn't used to performing but for groups of people in the tens of thousands, never had he done a show for one single solitary stranger.  Yes, he's done little performances for friends and such, private functions, you understand, but this was a big auditorium, hundred-dollar tickets.  He should leave.  He probably shouldn't even refund the money, after all, a disastrous event like this needs some salvaging, right?

But no.  This man, you understand, was a true entertainer.  Entertainment was not a quantity thing by his approach.  If there were a billion potential people to be entertained, his goal was to make sure that he gave his best for each and every one of them.  If his best wasn't good enough, then he'd have to rethink his talents and live with that.  But, for his entire life, his talents were good enough, and, in fact, were more than most expected.

And so, he turned off the house lights and let loose.

You must understand, the performer knows that the guests are not to be offended in any way (although there is a place for it).  His lifeforece is determined by the people who watch him, who love him.  The entertainer realizes that if he can please this one fan, then his night will have been worht it.

Now know this, the one fan in the audience knew he was the only fan, knew that nobody else was there, knew that the liklihood of a show was very small, but this man was a fan and dedicated to the entertainer.  This fan knew that he'd be damned if he'd let the entertainer down by not showing up.  He knew that the entertainer was nothing without fans.  Fans to feed the fire, as it were.

And so they existed amongst each other, for thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of performances.  Neither spoke a word to the other and yet volumes were siad.  ""I appreciate YOU!"" each was saying in their own language, and the appreciation bred creativity and the creativity bred appreciation.  And so it went for all eternity, you understand.  And so they are there still today, a remarkable example of what it is to perform, and what it is to be performed for."

It's because of this tree that the grass doesn't look out of place, but you still have that unsettling first impression.  It's good, then that the birds in the tree seem to constantly be singing and fluttering about, very active beasts that they are.  It calms you and you walk in.  After getting accustomed to all of this, the small river doesn't seem like such a stretch.  It's not a big river by any means, and no it's not natural.  Truly, none of this stuff is and we take great pride in keeping it there and not using faux items of furnishment.  No sir, we go the whole 9.

At any rate, you'll see the occasional boat float through the river and yes, that's why the river is there.  It's transportation, you see, through the house, for the house is a large one.  Yes, it'd be faster to walk, but who wants to walk when you can go by boat?  Besides, we've placed some fun things along the river that you just can't see for sake of walking.  Mind you that we've placed some interesting things along the paths so the walkers don't feel left out.  Everybody is taken care of here.

Feel free to get in a boat (assuming it's empty, we house a great many parties and people tend to take it nice and easy in the river).  Please, if you are a member of one of the parties, we don't carry much alcohol here, so please limit yourself.  No drugs either, we're trying to keep it clean.  There's much to do without need for booze and whatnot, and you'd greatly insult the members of this household if you insisted on 'altering' your visit in any way shape or form.  Please, we beg you.

I was deep in remembrance of times past, smelling the roasting meat in the kitchen, faintly hearing the clinging of dishes and glasses and the din of idle chatter.

""Ahoy, lad,"" he said.  ""Thar be more truth 'en ya know of the devil makin' dealins with the average man, matey.""

The pirate nodded gravely in my direction and took a swig of ale from a stein at hand.

""Ta be truly wantin the luv of yer life, be it money, er the ladies, er sumthin all the grander to ya, there's always a cost, mate.  There's always somethin' ya got to be willin ta part with, lad.  And what ya got ta be willin ta part with is usually somethin you will always yearn fer but always konw in yer heart that ya can't havit.""

The pirate took one last swig, gazed right into my eyes, stood, then left.  The waitress came with my food and I hungrily began eating. 

When I got home, I wrote this entry so I'd never forget what the pirate said to me.  I knew, that is, I know that it will be important to remember in the future."

"event","A shot fired into the air, all the innocents ran, ducking underneath invisible shields.  I humble myself in times when I'm about to die.

The shot was not meant for anybody in particular.  True, an intended human target was near, but the shot was more to alert that person or persons to the simple fact that Mr. Death was approaching and there was little to be done but duck as low as possible and scurry towards something big and heavy and inanimate for protection.  

When young the child finds solace in others and seeks protection from larger beings.  When older, larger being do not exist and solace is felt in anything tangible.  

Another shot fired, target hit.  Screams, crying, dying, bleeding.  

In the dark room, a spotlight shines on a single writer, typing miniature works into an electronic ocean where the occasional fish might just swim close enough to read, dare I say, understand.

Why do I write this drivel?  Why do I continually place items of fiction in a location suited best for fact?

The answer is an obvious one, but there are many potentially obvious answers that are not correct in this particular case.  So, do I say it?  Do I give myself away?  To whom would I be giving myself away?  I, yet, am known not but to a small audience only one or two which pay any attention at all.

I am neither endearing nor fascinating.  I am here, and I'll be here as long as fate deems it essential before the fallen dominoes are placed upright only to fall again in the future.  
<i>The way things move</i>
The fiction I write carries a heavy burden.  That burden, readers of the light (light being the phosphorescent glow of your monitors), is to carry the immense weight of meanings which can be deciphered in an infinite number of ways in an infinite number of perspectives.

You all know me inside and out, but it is not I that you know, it is you.  When you read, you understand me.  When I write I understand you.  Stop.  Reverse that.  On we go.

The shot fired into the air, you see, was a violent repercussion of acts against the man known as The Daffodil.  The acts, as they were, were numerous in nature and complicated beyond understanding except for the fact that we understand perfectly.  A woman was involved.  Money was involved.  Art, was not in the picture anywhere, so one might understand why the shot was fired in the first place.  The shot was fired by one Borlyle Grentarious, also know to his friends and deceased acquaintances as The Puppet.  He was puppet to a master known as The Daffodil.  He is no longer The Puppet.

A master craftsman had once said that the art of creating the perfect anything is in the desire to create something, BUT perfection cannot be anwhere in the equation or else the object d' creation ceases to be perfect and reeks of lust.  Lust smells rotten.  Lust burns the nose like a strong vinegar.  

The Daffodil is quietly lifted up off of the table and placed further down the line by the unseen hand and placed, where 67 years later it will fall again.

Pleasant Eve.  See you all tomorrow :-)."

"event","If I remember correctly, it was about 2:30 when the sky became overcast yesterday.  Sitting inside, I never actually realized that rain was coming until the Outside dimmed a bit, then a bit further, then wetness.  And so I sat in my darkened room, listening to the rain hit the window.  I sat here and listened and pondered as the air was freshened outside.  I closed my eyes and thought about the sandcastle, 4 stories tall, with doors big enough for real men to go in and out of.  How my metropolis would never stand a chance to woo a professional sports team, because of this rain.

My greatest creation is gone forever due to circumstances beyond my control.  But, I think as the rain continues, there's a lot more sand and a lot more time.  I'll just build it better tomorrow.

And I smile."

Nothing?

Here's a hint... it was an orange.

The tree was a Papaya tree.

The point of the story, oh brethren of the night, is that you shouldn't be sticking your ass in places it doesn't belong in the first place.  Why would I tell you that?

Allow me to explain...

Years ago, upon conquering the fjords of Lederschuben, I fell upon a dying emu that was in the throes of its death rattle.  I finished the bugger off with my rusty Swiss Army knife and transported myself back to the lands of Kranz, as I call them, back home to Smartol, Conneticut.  When I got there I discovered that not only had my family been horribly murdered and disected by pirates, but somebody left the oven on in their hurried cannibalistic baking preparations.  ""What a bunch of hooligans,"" I thought to myself.

I went outside to see if my neighbors had been too terribly disturbed by the ruckus.  I knocked on Phil McWeaver's place, then entered as I normally do.  What I saw was a bit of a shock as my girlfriend and former 1st mate of my yacht, was being triple penetrated by my neighbor who, apparently, had a dildo fetish of some kind.  

Wait, I'm getting off track, where was I?"

I am cold.

I breathe, remnants of the dreams flooding back, teasing my memory.

Coherent parts recall themselves, I become amazed, awake.

I breathe.

I'm cold.

I trip on my shoe getting up and fall on a pile of dirty laundry."

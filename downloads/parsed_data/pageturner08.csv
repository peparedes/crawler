The Diary of Anne Frank is a play about a girl,her family,and family friends,and their experiences trying to avoid capture during the Holocaust.

Anne's family is forced to hide in the upstairs of an office building. With Anne are seven others;Mr.Frank,Mrs.Frank,Margot Frank,Mrs.Van Daan,Mr.Van Dann,Peter Van Daan and Mr.Dussel.Helping then survive and prroviding them food are Miep and Mr.Kraler.There is limited space in the building so that leaves some to share a room with others.

Anne and the others have no choice but to stay quiet all day until the people working downstairs leave so nobody will suspect anything from upstairs.They cannot use any water from the sink or tub or make any kind of noise at all or they risk getting caught.

Occasionally there were fights among those eight people but they managed to survive.Mr.Dussel would usually complain of Anne being so annoying and loud while she was sleeping that he couldn't hardly even stand it anymore. 

After about two years of hiding upstairs,someone had discovered their hiding place.Anne and everybody else were doing their normal things when they heard a car screaching outside the building.it was the Green Police.They had been captured and were taken away to concentration camps where Anne later died.

The connection I made from my notes was that the eight people in the play were sent to concentration camps and tons of people from the Holocaust were sent their as well.Another thing was that they could not leave the building or they would get caught and if the Jews were to leave the ghettos,they would have gotten caught as well.

"event","THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER
by: Francis Scott Key (1779-1843)
 O SAY, can you see, by the dawn's early light, 
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? 
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight 
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming! 
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, 
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there; 
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? 

On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep, 
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, 
What is that which the breeze o'er the towering steep, 
As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses? 
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, 
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream; 
'Tis the star-spangled banner! O long may it wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! 

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore 
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion, 
A home and a country should leave us no more? 
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution. 
No refuge could save the hireling and slave, 
From terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave: 
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! 

Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand 
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation! 
Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land 
Praise the Power that made and preserved us a nation! 
Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just, 
And this be out motto:-- ""In God is our trust!"" 
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave 
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.





""The Star-Spangled Banner"" is about the bombardment of Fort McHenry which began on September 13,1812. It was the war between the United States and England.

Place-the admiral's flag ship
      Baltimore in 1812

Person-3rd person

Compare and Contrast- The poet's view is enthusiastic and he was anxious to print his new poem and get it in the newspapers.The historical view is the war of 1812 between the United States and England.And how it has been accepted as our National Anthem."

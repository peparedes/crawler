I Like to use this as a way to keep in touch with another friend.
and to be able to just write when i need to. and not have 500,000 people look at it like on myspace. grr. who don't even care. when it's really for me. or for someone i care about to just respond.. or not to. maybe i just need a friend or two with some advice. got any?

I think it's partly i ran out of my anti depressents last week. two days. and sent everything out of orbit. i'm back on it now. my sleeps been off. Kira's an alcohalic. i've had the last of it. Monday we went to an AA meeting. Came home and she stole our beer. the police took her away. <i>again</i>. short version. I'm <big><b>angry and depressed</b></big>. 
I skipped worked today, didn't even call. i'll probably be fired finally. i slept all day. was awake most of last night. i just want to swallow a bottle of pills. but i sleep and eat and watch tv to keep myself from doing anything too stupid. today is my sister's birthday. i hate it when my parents are gone. they'll be home tomorrow. and charmed will be on for the last time. ever"

"event","i've decided i like girls more than i like guys. but i still like some guys. but a guy i loved screwed me over so now i basically say fuck em right... but i've really liked girls to begin with. i just i dunno. needed a guy to fuck me over? i dunno. that doesn't seem right. i like girls. though.

Something so cool happen though cause one of my older friends was like ""rachel i knew you liked girls since the day i met you"" and i was like ""omg"" and omg. She likes girls too but she's dating a guy right now. but i really like her. So hopefully we'll be good friends for a long time. so thats how i came to realize i like girls! We'll i mean i guess i knew. So it's how i came to accept it? isn't that great. but i'm shy. and yeah. but right now i'm not even looking for a reationship. just more friends. maybe some more answers. or not even answers. i don't know. does that make sense? I wish i could talk to her some more. well i'll talk to you later. its 5 am. I Love You"

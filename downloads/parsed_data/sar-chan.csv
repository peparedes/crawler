Not really much else to report. I watched my John Wayne Gacy dvd. I'm gonna talk about it with Rick on Tuesday. Maybe he can show me the serial killer book thats in the library. I tried to find it but couldn't. 

James, a close friend online, has been feeling down and angry at his parents alot lately. He's a really nice guy and is fun to talk to so I feel bad. He won't talk to me cause he doesn't want to take his anger out on me but I miss our convos. I remember the first one we had over web cam.

James: See? You are black!
Me: Um...James..I'm the palest of the whites here dude. 
James: ....Oh...Yay! 

Got my period too so we know how fun that is. Been craving alot of salt and chocolate. I hate that. I hate what my hormones do to me. So I'm getting on birth control maybe winter break. I dunno. Might wait until summer break. I also want pants. Like really baggy pants. Like what the chick Nancy on E-Bay makes. *wiggleS* Dammit! I wish I could buy that kind of shit! I can't even afford to send a package with a gift in it to Ben yet he's mailing me a plushie cause he knows how much I love Sonic and those characters. 

Surgery this summer...no flow of cash...Going home next weekend to see a play. I'm also seeing a play during winter and summer break. Should be fun. 

Taking 16 credits next semester. I'll post my schedule during winter break. 

Thats about all. 

Time to go back to work on Silence."

I also am enjoying SEnior Portfolio. I've somehow learned how to draw realistically! Wow!! Big word! NEWAY, I got a 95 on my sunflower project and am now working on a drawing of hands. Woo. In textiles, I'm still working on my project that was due like a week ago but I finally got the flamingo stiched on which was the most important part! Woo. Mine and Josh's 9 month anniversary is this Tuesday so that's great. Iris is making me pants and other then that everything's great. In swimming, this one girl might be kicked off and I'm like, ""Finally! All she does is slack and blame people for her slowness and stuff.""

I could kill my coach from last year.

"event","::flops over:: There I am with only one more day until I leave for vacation and what happens! I end up having an ear infection. Joy. My mom isn't too worried about it while my bro thinks I should be taking to the hospital right away. I have an odd family. So that is the big side of my lame life. I'll write more if anything interesting or new happens.

"event","I do not copy other peoples ideas. And one of my friends told me to make a journal to keep me occupied. So would you please leave me alone and go read someone else's journal if mine bores you since I don't have a very entertaining life. Bleah. Where's Darc or Tass or Eunos when you need them. They wouldn't like this person one bit. ::walks away to finish her chores::"

Just like I have a right to free speech (I hate that right but it is a right non the less). So what ever you have against me, take it up with me personnally or just leave me alone! I never bothered you. ::sighs, goes to ice down her knees::

"event","Flop. Enough said. Bored, tired, injured. Sounds like a normal swim practice to me! Let's hear it for all the the guys that raced and lost to me today! Sorry, Brian, Mark, and Joey. Oh yeah and that person that I dunno either. Sucks to be them. Enough about that anyway. It's finaly been nice weather around here. So I was able to hang out at my pool today. Yay! And annoy the neighbors with my music. Only 4 more days until Ocean City, MD. Get to go surf/boogie board. And shop! Lots and lots of places to shop. :> I can hardly wait. Gonna miss my friends though. Oh well. Enough for now. Write more later.

"event","Meep. Dun like taking medicine and I hate going to the hospital and I hate, hate doctors. The reason? 
1) I hate doctors just because I do.
2) I hate hospitals cause they always keep you waiting! Like when I dislocated my jaw. I waited for 2 hours and 15 mins. 
3) I hate medicine cause it either makes you tired or it tastes really nasty! Really nasty! 
And that is how I spent my fourth of July at 10:05 at night. Waiting for the doctors at a hospital to take a look at the bull's eye mark on my leg. Fun, fun, fun. So now I'm on meds that make me sleep. More fun. Ok. Enough for today. I'll also try to write more often."

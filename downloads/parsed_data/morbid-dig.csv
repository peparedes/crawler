Your Beauty lies in Sadness. Lonely, depressed and feeling broken.<br>For whatever reason, you see
this world only for the bad that it holds carrying<br>the burdens of yourself and
others. Some people like to be with you and your<br>unique vantage point when they
are down, you are someone who can sympathize with<br>them. But you find yourself
alone again when they seem to find a solution and<br>are happy again, yet you still
are stuck in this rut. Do not worry, you will make<br>it out at some time. Everyone
does, if you try. When you are seen all others want<br>to do is make your pain go
away, but that is something only you can do. You<br>probably keep to yourself a lot
and don't like to let people in, afraid to be hurt<br>again. You feel empty and
helpless and your looks reflect that, often seen<br>with tears in your eyes.</p>

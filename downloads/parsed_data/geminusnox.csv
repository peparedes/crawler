"event","<i>i picked you out of a crowd and talked to you.

I said, ""I like your shoes.""
You said, ""Thanks can I follow you?""
So it's up the stairs and out of view. 
No prying eyes. I poured some wine. 
I asked your name. You asked the time. 
It is 2 o'clock. The club is closed and we are up the block. 
Your hands are on me. I am pressing hard against your jeans. 
Your tounge is in my mouth, trying hard to keep the words from coming out.
You didn't care to know who else may been you before.

I want a lover I don't have to love. 
I want a girl that is too sad to give a fuck. 
Where's the kid with the chemicals? 
I thought he said to meet him here, but I'm not sure. 
I got the money if you've got the time.

You said, ""It feels good.""
I said, ""I'll give it a try.""

Then my mind went dark. 
We both forgot where your car was parked. 
Let's take the train. I'll meet up with the band in the morning.

Bad actors with bad habits. 
Some sad singers they just play tragic. 
Well, the phones ringing and the van is leaving. 
Let's just keep touching. Let's just keep singing.

I want a lover I don't have to love. 
I want a boy who is so drunk he doesn't talk. 
Where's the kid with the chemicals? 
I have a hunger and I can't seem to get full. 
I need some meaning I can memorize. 
The kind I have always seem to slip my mind.

But you write such pretty words. 
But life is no storybook. 
Love is an excuse to get hurt and to hurt.

""Do you like to hurt?""
""I do. I do.""
""Then hurt me.""
</i>

Is that what it was with Jon? not even it was even more evil than all that. he wouldnt love me unless i was ""Jewish"" and then broke up with me, when i wanted to choose my own religion, and THEN, he decided HE didnt want to be Jewish either. i still want to be friends with him, i think he has some sort of hope. but he's been such an asshole to me, i'm almost giving up. 

we werent in love, i see now. we were in hate. in a passion. and we werent friends. he's too fucked up in his own life with his mom and everything... 

*sighs*.

i didnt want to mention it, but he really hurt my feelings during finals. during my period one final, he called and accused me of changing his livejournal and email passwords. ....

*smiles softly* i just spoke with my boyfriend and read him the entries i made. he says i should give up hope of getting through to Jon that i am trying to be a friend to him, not his enemy. Lance says ""Besides, you know you have better friends here, and no one is ever going to treat you like that, here, 'cept maybe she whom is not named"". i couldnt help but laugh. he always calls her that, now. i love him so much.

i wish Jon realized that he has more hope for sanity in the city than in the rural areas he keeps drawing himself to. not that i really want to run into him, but i wish he wouldnt keep running into mirrors. ...poor thing.


<i>Does he kiss your eyelids in the morning when you start to raise your head? And does he sing to you incessantly from the place between your bed and wall? Does he walk around all day at school with his feet inside your shoes? Looking down every few steps to pretend he walks with you. Does he know that place below your neck that is your favorite to be touched and does he cry through broken sentences like I love you far too much? Does he lay awake listening to your breath? Worried that you smoke too many cigarettes. Is he coughing now on a bathroom floor? For every speck of tile there are a thousand more that you won?t ever see but most hold inside yourself eternally. I drug your ghost across the country and we plotted out my death. In every city, memories would whisper, Here is where you rest. I was determined in Chicago but I dug my teeth into my knees and I settled for a telephone and sang into your machine. You are my sunshine, my only sunshine I kissed a girl with a broken jaw that her father gave to her. She had eyes bright enough to burn me. 

They reminded me of yours. In a story told she was a little girl in a red-rouge, sun-bruised field and there were rows of ripe tomatoes where a secret was concealed. And it rose like thunder, clapped under our hands. And it stretched for centuries to a diary entry?s end where I wrote, You make me happy when the skies are gray You make me happy the skies are gray and gray and gray. Well the clock?s heart it hangs inside its open chest with its hands stretched towards the calendar hanging itself but I will not weep for those dying days. For all the ones who have left there are a few that stayed. And they found me here and pulled me from the grass where I was laid.</I>"

"event","i wonder. today, one of my parents came to me worried if i knew that certain friends of mine were using me or not. the thing is... my friends that she was talking about dont USE me, they just think im rich so like to make like their little princesses when they're around. 

not important right now. 

as i listen to these bass beats reverberating in my brain, i can close my eyes and remember what it was like to dance to these things back when i was younger. i sound like i'm an old raver, but really im a fifteen year old raver baby who just remembers what it was like back when things weren't so dangerous at every house party.

it annoys me that i have to take my cell phone and pepper spray to every party i go to. i get lost in the music....

and slowly things level out.

im closing my eyes now so excuse my typos. ill correct them later. the headphones feel good on my hea, like they belong there.. i miss my turn table. 

i might get a pocket bike!!!!

its... so cool... meow...

meow...

so now, getting down to business. 

i want to know who the hell my friends are. 

i was sitting at the dildo spot and thinking about Josh and i looked around at all the people at the place i was at and then just... left. i was so pissed off. i was so angry at myself. why was i there? what was i getting out of it? none of these people even know my last name. theres too much drama in their lives. i decided to go looking for Jo, and she found me. i told her i wanted to kick it with her and possibly walk her home if it was chill with her. she was fine with it, and she was actually anxious to know if anything was wrong with me. i smiled, it felt sweet to know that someone cared for a change."

"event","so apparently my place is a new hangout for teens. i cant say i object, but i would like to set these boundries: 

BRING YOUR OWN DAMN BATHING SUITS.

heh. anyway. also, no smoking unless in my room, ALLEN. and no drinking my mom's booze, you bring your own, damnit. your OWN. i dont care how good hers are. 

(speaking of good)

so last night i spend around 6 until like 9 with two very-very dudes, one a skater punk, a very good pal of mine, and my new favorite black-white boy, anthony, who i will get a picture of soon. meow. anyway, my pal anthony is the obsession of this hunduran (sp?) ultra bitch named Dalia and she tried to come to my spot today in school and claim it, so i had to tell her off. heh. in P.e. i bitchslapped her because she pulled my hair, and since its short, she only pulled out a few strands. i pulled on her hair and pulled out so much that she has a nice big bald spot. she is so dead if she comes near me one more time. and i dont mean physically. i mean socially. even her friends like me alot more. besides that, the Dildo Corner is where i hang out, and if people are going to crash it, i AM going to help my pals fight back, Dalia. you bitch. 

anyway. getting drunk with anthony is fun. shit, i'd do him any time if it weren't for the fact that i had a boyfriend that i am very much in love with.

"event","Joey, baby - don't get crazy
Detours. Fences... I get defensive
I know you've heard it all before -
so I don't say it anymore
I just stand by and watch you
fight your secret war.
Although I used to wonder why -
I used to cry till I was dry.
Still sometimes I get a strange pain
inside
Oh, Joey, if you're hurting so am I.

Joey, honey - I got the money
All is forgiven. Listen, listen
And if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you.
And when you said I scared you,
well I guess you scared me too.
But we got lucky once before
and i dont wanna close the door
And if you're somewhere out there
passed out on the floor.
Oh Joey, I'm not angry anymore.

and if i seem to be confused
i didnt mean to be with you
and when you said i scared you 
well i guess you scared me too
but if its love you're looking for
then i can give alittle more
and if you're somewhere drunken 
passed out on the floor
oh, joey i'm not angry any more...
(angry any more... angry any more...)

Josh...

i love you so much...

meow...

BECAUSE ITS FUN, BITCH. so screw you. and josh, stop making fun of me for liking techno, im not a raver im just having fun...yea, thats it. *shifty eyes*. hehe.

<P><EM><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000 size=6>i dunno, all i know is i was reading Johnny's journal and Jessica was talking about her dad wanting to commit suicide and then i read my old journal entries in Dlynquinthabts and i was just like...</FONT></STRONG></EM></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff0000><EM><STRONG><FONT size=6>what if everyone who ever thought of suicide died? no one would be alive.</FONT></STRONG></EM> </FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>heh. what a fucking paradox. i wanted to die for so long, then i felt alittle bit of peace, now i realize wanting to die isnt the problem, its the reason you want to die thats the problem. why didnt i realize this before? its like a brick wall you keep walking into but you cant see. when will people also understand this? i mean, when my friends write about suicide, i dont mind it as much anymore, because i know that they're going through the same thing i went through. i mean, yea it can be dangerous, in many ways, to many people, but you know what? they need it. i understand this, and you cant say that you dont, because if you never thought of suicide then you're just as shallow as you can be, or you havent YET. some people go their whole lives thinking about nothing but suicide, and then die naturally. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>anyway. </FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000 size=5>i guess the point is that i want to be there for my suicidal pals and tell them, you know, it isnt the end. there is more to this world than is on the surface. and i know that i'm sounding like some stupid adult here but you're just in a place where people put you down and you're frustrated. do you know how many people come to me and tell me they have no talent? any one can do art. because everything is art. and i'm not fucking with you, i drew stick figures, and they took that and were like ""this is brilliant!"" and published it. when i worked on something really hard, they were overwhelmed. so dont be flabberghasted when people tell you you have no talent, or that you'll get no where in the world if you dont use the system, because its such total and complete bullshit. college is awesome, been there, done that. dont care for it. i havent gone through the full experience, its true, butyou know what? i'm going to go for an aprenticeship and be happy there, and maybe i will go to college afterward. but thats not the point. when the world looks bleak and you want to end it all and you're girlfriend or boyfriend left you or is angry at you for something really stupid (at least in your eyes) (note, i speak from experience, and from my friends') there is still that one shining ray of light. if its not your friends, your talent, your god, your mom, your sibling, or your public, its your will to show people ""i can do this. and you know what, bitch? you cant prove me wrong!"" i told this to johnny, but i think he thought i was stoned or something, because i dont even know if he was listening, but thats ok, i understand that he was impatient with anyone other than ali at that point. maybe he'll read this, maybe not. who really gives? ""being sorry's been my lifes devotion"" </FONT></STRONG></P>

holy shit thats alot of text. 

i got this from dorothy, whom i dunno who got it from who, so if she got it from you michelle, dont say i got it from you, ok? geez. 

and no, damnit, i didnt get cabbage from you, i said it before i even met you guys. and i'm sure people around the world have said the word ""CABBAGE"" before you. you're not so creative as to come up with a word yourself. lord. 

anyway

since i'm letting that go, and im not alowd to use that word, i'm using this, BIATCH, you quancemole-one-boobied-waffle-jlo-luvver!!! muahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


on to other things.

Johnny. i wanted to say that i really respect you, as far as i know you. the things Alex has told me about you, few as they may be, are very interested, and i'd like to get to know you better if its cool with you. if not, thats ok too, i'll understand, it's not like i'm the most interesting person in the world either. i tried to call and say happy mothers day to you and your mother, as i do to all my pals, but i think the line was busy or something, or no, i remember, you didnt pick up. thats ok, though, i didnt mind, i kinda woulda had to keep it short anyway, i was painting my mom her mother's day gift. it was a star scene at twilight, and a silloughette (or howeverthehellyouspellit). also, i understand sometimes you're not in the best of spirits, to put it lightly, and i just wanted to say that, not that you'd really want me to be here, but i'm here for you, man. and you know this already, but alex will always be there for you. 

i guess this LJ has turned into more like a letter to Johnny, but i wanted to add another picture for Josh. incase he ever fuckin gets on.

lol. i've been such a goof all week that people have been thinking i've been high. it's cause i've been so blah.  all of the sudden things have been looking up and then the one thing i want to be looking up goes wrong and im like ""oh-fucking-well"". 

and yet, i am happy. i'm successful, i'm in love, i'm making money, and i'm getting along with my family. sure there are some things i'd like to change, but without those things, i wouldnt apreciate the good things.

note, the good things =D muahhaahhaha. 

there was this chick that was bothering  me the other day, we wont mention her name, and she was ""taking [sugar]pills"" right. whatever. i dont give a flying rats ass. then she calls me up and says that shes going to the psych ward, and then that shes not, and finally i was so pissed i told her shes a liar and that she should go to the psych ward. 

maybe im alittle harsh. 

*smirks*. 

maybe. 

hard to say when she had sex on MY BED and fuckin' cries to me about it later because the guys an asshole to her about it later. DUH. of course he's going to be an asshole to you, you didnt even ARCH YOUR BACK, YOU DYKE!. ...nothing against lesbians, i love em *winks*. anyways.

"event","i was telling Alex all about Josh and how i met him and how when we were kids what we'd do to entertain ourselves and whatnot

i miss him like hell, you have no fucking clue. i want to remember all the times i kissed him and all the things we've been through together, the times we've brought eachother out of depression, or razorblade suicide. 

i love alex so much. shes always been here for me. i'll always be here for her. shes so amazing. shes been through just as much shit as i've been through and shes a real person through all of it. and shes so real with everything else. shes hardcore ADHD. shes talking about base ball one minute and guacamole the next. shes interested in emo, but shes not an emo goily. she smokes really cool. even though smoking isnt cool. we're talking about our first kisses and roses.  she was staring at the stars. with a fag hanging outa her mouth and the smoke was coming out of her nose and he wasnt moving for a good ten minutes. dmnit, this thing wont work with rich text!!!
damnit
waffels.....

you smeelllllll liiiikkkke brrrrooooocccclllliiiii!!!!!!

she was pretending she was an aeroplane. guhhick

leeave me alone. 

I NEED TO COMPUTE. 

i want to kill this certain person who thinks they are emo. but i know that cursing someone comes back to you times three. so instead. im going to get along with the bitch. and kill her with kindness. she hates when im nice to her anyway. 

an eleven year old once said ""kill em with kindness, theres no need for fighting."" and ""technically, none of us are virgins, cause we've all been fucked by the world.""

awe, fuck, the things i think of when im tired. 

i've been talking with Alex for a good 10 hours now, and i realize, this is the truth, that she is one of my very best and closest friends. she has a brightness about her that no one can take and no one better damn well label, or ill come to fuck with them, too. she has so much to give, and im going to give her a way to shine, if it kills me. i've got to talk to my grandmother, by this weekend. and i really have to get that god damned zine together. she nick named a girl and she named her lover danced with her in kitchens through the greenest summers, autumn came she disapeared she cant remember where she said she was going to. ""but i believe that lovers should be draped in flowers and laid entwined together on a bed of clover, left there to sleep, left there to dream of there innocence."" - bright eyes. 

drugs kinda suck, yu know that?

<img src=http://img8.photobucket.com/albums/v26/my_silent_cry/sirens2small.jpg>

this guy. isnt it perty? i wonder if i can even keep  josh's interest this time. damnit i hate smoking. i hate being addicted, i do. i love josh so much i really hope hes ok and that bitch leaves him alone without those threats of suicide. i want to hold him so much.i want to kiss him and brush my eyelashes against his cheek in a butterfly kiss. i want to learn how to play bass the right way. i had a dream that he was teaching me bass guitar and it was really sweet, he was standing behind me and i was learning all thees beautiful cords. he taught he how to play these ongs by his band. it was really sweet....

she's this insane person with an attitude? shes this bitch from hell with an aristic twist to her? shes a writer from another world with the guts to tell it as it is? shes a big town girl with a small town heart. no. i dont think so. 

you know who she is? 
well then tell her. 

because if she doesnt know, then how in the fucking hell do you think you can tell her? i am Vanessa. and Vanessa is a writer and an artist and a good friend to those who dont treat her like crap. shes a hardcore concieted bitch about her art, and Vanessa loves her friends and lovers with more passion and LOVE than alot of people think possible by her. Vanessa is not emo. Vanessa is not punk. Vanesa is not techno. Vanessa is not rocker. Vanessa is not any of those stupid labels, Vanessa is her own person in her own way.

i've given up on relationships. i'll let people come to me. 

i gave up on guys, and they started noticing me. Girls started noticing me too, but thats another story. but i dont really care for anyone, not in the way i care for Jon. and if he said ""Vanessa, i'd like to give it another try... would you still be willing?"" i'd actually say not yet. i want to get my career together. i'm going into a apprenticeship for Fashion Design in Los Angeles Trade Tech. and since i'm a home town girl, i'm gonna get in for even less. they start to pay <u>us</u> at $15 an hour and within three to four years, we're paid $30,000 a year. thats fucking good pay for just being a fashion student, and thats not even being in the field yet. i mean, yes, we get field hours, but we dont really get our stuff on the walk ways, i dont think, but then i'm not there yet, so i dont know. i have to take life drawing classes. but thats ok, because i need it for my career. and besides, i like drawing people. 

i chopped all my hair off and plucked my eyebrows so much that i have to draw a certain part of them back on (thats my mothers fault, actually). i'm not as pale anymore, i'm getting out in the sun and wearing short skirts and capris. still, i always wear sunscreen before going out, and have a japanese parisol.

the Lord's been good to me, i've been losing alot of weight in a short time, i'm already a size 11 in girl's pants, which is i beeeelieeeeeve a 34 in guys, cus i fit into my 34s as well. and i can fit into my corsets!!! weeeeeeeeee!! my tattoo faded into nothingness. yay! Jon's phone must be off the hook because it's been saying its disconnected for about two weeks now, and he hasnt been online. 

i'll admit that i miss calling every day and saying i love you this and i miss you that. it had been a year since we actually saw eachother. for those of you who were following and remember Jon's backlogs, he wrote about the three days i spent in Oklahoma and what happened. not ALL of what happened, but some. still, with all that. i have managed to find this place in life where i would like to stay. i want to get my shit together. i want to become a great fashion designer. i want to hold my head high and say that i can do this. because i know i can. and know what?

i should be scared right now. i should be paranoid and excited and i should be sweating and worrying about my tampon and glancing at the window every few seconds to see if anyone's looking at me. i should be twisting my rings on my fingers nervously, getting ready for it. i should be washing my clothes or writing some ""goodbye"" note, or taking pictures of the few things i'll never see again, or listening to music that i'll never hear again, or something like that. i should be talking with mom and dad as much as i can and ""bonding"" and watching movies with them that i might never see again. i should be working on memorizing my scene as the cheshire cat in alice in wonderland, or pretending to, or dying my hair, or shaving or washing my face or carving my little statues or feeling sick or puking or crying or SOMETHING... i should be. 

but i'm not. 

no. not me. i'm just blank. i'm not really thinking about much of anything. just, maybe i should go to sleep. sleep sounds good. yea...i'm drinking chamomile tea without enough honey, or sugar as mother wanted to put in it. i'm staring at cold, dry, pale, shaky hands, mine, i think, and watching how they seem lifeless even thought they're moving faster than i think up what words to put down. my eyes are only half open. and i wouldnt have known that unless my mom didnt just come in and tell me that my eyes were ""all droopy. maybe you should go mimi, suga buga."" i'm pale. i've been getting mroe and more pale in the past three days. i bit my nails off, except for my ring finger's nails, adn they all still look long. and by the way, i didnt notice that either, until patrick pulled my hand from my mouth. he was playing on his gameboy and without looking up, he reached over and made me stop, telling me that i was beginning to worry him. he doesnt know where i'm going or why, but he knows i am. i think i almost trust him. he's really rather nice. and he's funny, but not too intelligent. still, he's very wise. common sense is not something so very common with this boy. i realize now that he was not meaning to pull my leg when he pretended he didnt understand me, he actually just didnt know whether he could trust me or not. i guess now he can. i wonder why i'm thinking about him. i didnt see him today, he was at church because his parents are very catholic, and he's very athiest. they're trying to ""beat the devil out of him"". i've seen him with cuts and bruises coming to school, and he pretends like a ""tree ran into him"", as he pretends he's a bad bicyclist. but i know they hit him. they started hitting me yesturday. i didnt talk to Josh about it. i dont think i really want to. both of them did it. they came home drunk at around 2 in the morning and i woke up because they were laughing so loud. i came out and got some water, told them they were too loud, and they ...

i guess i have a reason to go now. though, really, i did have a reason before. i just couldnt tell anyone. i guess i still cant, but i sort of can. the other one was the kind of secret i could get killed for, this one is just sorta ""oh, poor baby... gee, shucks, lalalala, pitypitybooboo"". 

maybe thats why i'm blank. maybe thats why i'm feeling like i'm... not. i love them all, you know. i dont hate any of them. the only person i could possibly hate is already dead. and i dont really hate them, i hate the things they did. i know that deep inside, they arent like that. i love people. maybe thats why i leave them. so they wont hate me. so they wont be ruined because of me. 

get air.

Josh hurt me. it's true. 

but dont tell him that. because i've hurt him too. it never really should be mentioned. but i think that this time i am actually going to just let it flow. no cencoring. here it goes, Josh, this is how i really feel. ever since i can remember, whenever i thought of Josh, it was always in this sort of ""you're so cute"" almost nieve way, when we first got to know each other. he never really treated me like all the other girls, or even the guys, he treated me like a sister, even more so than he treated his sisters. and honestly, i was content to keep it like that for a while, even though at night, i would dream of him, not to exclude the other people i had dreams of, but whenever i think of it now, only two names come up, and its really sometimes rather disturbing the other name, but his was always there. once i had a rather serious bout of insanity, and i remember being on the phone with Josh, thinking that he had broken up with me, and being heart broken over the whole thing, then hearing him cry ont he phone, confused as i was. i found later that when ihad picked up the phone, no one was there and i was just talking to myself. but i heard Josh's voice, and he said it was over, that he loved someone else. but... he never said that. was i insane? a fair question. yes. am i now? oh, not as much as before, but i'm pretty mad. Josh had done a few things to me i felt like shit over, but i know i did quite a bit to him as well. maybe we're even. i dont care right now. i'm complaining to oneoneness, and they're a good listener. thats another thing. i dont like to complain, as any of my friends know perfectly well if' i've known them for more than three months. and when i talk to Josh, i cant do it. i'll start crying because i cant complain. i simply couldnt do it. i even try so hard, and nothing comes. 

i cried about Marqueze last night. my baby... i cried about her to Josh. why? i dont know. i think i was looking for a reason to cry. i think i really just needed to cry. sometimes i know i need that. but usually i wait until everyone's asleep, then look at the scars and hold her passifier in my hand and just scream into my pillow. pillows are good listeners, too. ...i love Josh. more than anything. i love everything about him. so why cant i talk to him? 

because he talks to me. 

and thats good. because he needs to. so i let him. i've never really complained about it, at least i think i havent. i am not now, by the way. i'm just acknowledging it. there was a time when whenever i thought of him, it felt like glass was being lordged into my heart, and i swear tears came to my eyes every time. thank god i could stil write. i think if i lacked the ability to write, i would have commited suicide by now and if i did, alot of other people, including my lover, would have, as well. and we just cant have that, now can we?

nooooo...

i cant even kill myself alone. 

people are always there. even in my death. where can i enjoy my solitude? and if you're not going to let me enjoy solitude, then why not let me be with people i can enjoy being around? why stick me right in the middle? because you want me to beg for everything? 

i see flashes in my mind. marqueze's crib. kisses in the dark. blood on white tile. a window that doctors were looking through,. a hand, a very veiny old hand with a silver band on the ring finger, stroking my cheek. i can feel the voices, but i cant hear them. 


i'm going to scream. 


glad i got that out. 

i think it's time for me to eat my crunchy top ramen noodles and go to sleep. oh yea, an di have to puke too. 

on a lighter note, i god nominated grossest girl the other day. because i've tried so very hard to burb for over 8 months now, and talk insessently about tampons and boogers and fucking and farts and other such bodily functions so much, they decided that i was one of the grossest girls in Japanese club. 

wee hoo. 

i also finally found my retainers. 

yeee."

....glad to get that out of my system
BUT STICK WITH ME, MEH STORY GETS BETTA! --eddie izzard. 

thats RIGHT boys and girls. i'm burning all my skirts and was almost going to throw away all my bras (somehow, my BROTHER stopped me from it, telling me i bounce too much, adn that'd be way too girly even for a girl.). i finished bleaching out my hair and i'm about to use toner on it so it'll be evenly platnum before i blue it out. 

i decided last night that with all my troubles with boys, i'd just stick to girls. it's getting to be too much. i make a much better boy than  alot fo the boys i know. i'm beginning to feel weak aound them, and i hate that feeling. girls make me feel strong because they seem to lean on me, while boys dont just lean on me, they tug me down WITH them. im sure and know for a fact that not all guys are like that. but it seems like i fall for the ones that want to hurt me, so i am giving up on them. if one can manage to change my mind, power to them. until then, i'm sticking to being a dyke. it's what i do best. Goddess knows i love Josh, but even talking to him is beginning to be painful. i couldnt even imagine what actually looking him in the eyes will bring to the stake lodged into my heart. 

so. i stick with girls. 

i can figure out girls. i mean, yea, guys are easier, but girls...

i like the challenge. lets put it like that. and when it comes to sex, yes i have experience on both ends. and i DO have to admit, i enjoy the sexual company of females as opposed to males. why? *shrugs* eh, got me. 

also, they're easier for me to draw. not that THAT is a huge thing, really. i've drawn and painted countless boys. but i much more enjoy women. the curves of their natural bodies, the calm they can possess while lying in contentment, the way the candle light i like to use can accent parts of their body... its just different. even girls with NO hips, and NO breasts, even those select few whom i envy in their ability to surpass many boys with their bodies, even they have a definate grace and charm. scars and cuts and stretch marks and hair and blemishes, a woman sitting or lying on a bed or in a chair somehow posesses the ability to become a goddess. at least, in my eyes. i cant speak for every person, or even every lesbian. but to me, both men and women are beautiful, but i think the God and Goddess meant for women to be the art. *shrugs* like i said, just me.  

one of my friends that i've spoken of to a few of you in the past about is Kaylah. a few weeks ago, infact, right before i saw my precious Malice-chan, and when she came over, i had her lie down and i drew her. for half an hour we were in silence. she was even in her clothing. keep in mind, shes a girl my size, maybe smaller, and taller than me by two inches. she has the same curves, except at her breasts. hers are once size smaller, and yet she and i could pass for twin sisters. (even Vicky said that oO). so no, shes not like your little 12-year-old-boy-like-type super models we have now-a-days, shes not even porn-model worthy on a few levels (AFEW). shes curvy, practically boob-less, and turns bright red at even the mention of sex. no, shes noy shy, but her body is. 

*sighs* i cant help but care for certain people. and sometimes my care and affection goes further than what society holds and deems as being acceptable without being romance. and... well, its just not romance. sometimes, i'll kiss my friends, full on the lips, and if they've been my friend for a while, they know that it doesnt mean i want them sexually or romantically, just that i care immensely for them. in Princess Mononoke, when Ashitaka is recovering from death and cant even chew jerky, San chews it for him and puts it into his mouth with what we call a french kiss. its nature, natural. the God and Goddess meant for us to be compassionate creatures. for years i've tried to deny my compassion fro humans, and just recently, within the past year or so, have i been able to accept that i do love humans. sometimes i DESPISE what certain humans, in their unnatural ignorance, have chosen to do, either momentarily, or with their lives, but i love them. if it didnt scare so many of my newer friends, i would kiss and embrace them constantly. i leave that for house parties with closer friends, or for my old friends who know me well enough to accept my affection as just that: affection. but...

Joey, baby - don't get crazy
Detours. Fences... I get defensive
I know you've heard it all before -
so I don't say it anymore
I just stand by and watch you
fight your secret war.
Although I used to wonder why -
I used to cry till I was dry.
Still sometimes I get a strange pain
inside
Oh, Joey, if you're hurting so am I.

Joey, honey - I got the money
All is forgiven. Listen, listen
And if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you.
And when you said I scared you,
well I guess you scared me too.
But we got lucky once before
and i dont wanna close the door
And if you're somewhere out there
passed out on the floor.
Oh Joey, I'm not angry anymore.

and if i seem to be confused
i didnt mean to be with you
and when you said i scared you 
well i guess you scared me too
but if its love you're looking for
then i can give alittle more
and if you're somewhere drunken 
passed out on the floor
oh, joey i'm not angry any more...
(angry any more... angry any more...)

Joey, by Concrete Blonde on the bloodletting record. 

...i love Josh. i cant really stop that. but if i keep pulling myself in and pushing myself back up for air, oneof us is going to break. more than likely me, though i wouldnt doubt he might either. maybe i shouldnt have told him about my becoming full dyke.

...rawr. 

we're reading Romeo and Juliet. and we're reading. and i'm content to mentaly translate these squiggly things ona  peice of paper into words in my mind so that it can create a story that i am much obliged to hear. but no. they had to bring it up. 

they HAD to do it. why? because they have cooties.

snarl hiss ftt ftt. 

Relig-ee-un. yeeeep. they were discussing, INSTEAD OF ""whats in a name, a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet"" WHY WE SHOULD OR SHOULDNT HAVE ""UNDER GOD"" IN THE PLEDGE OF ALEGIENCE. and being me. i just simply HAD. to. spout. off. 

<lj-cut> They, being my english class, instead of doing the benchmark, as i was keen to do (my quote was one by Virginia Woolf), wanted to have a discussion on why we should or shouldnt have those GOD BLESSED two words in the FUCKING pledge. dont get me wrong, i think its a lovely system they have running in the government. now, if only they would listen to their own rules instead of trying to bend them. ""if you bend bamboo too far, it will break."" anyway, so my class goes on and on about how ""god would have wanted his BEST country to have Him in the pledge"". i argued that if this was His best country, that we wouldnt be in war. and furthermore, that people had a right whether or not to even SAY the pledge. the only thing wrong was that children were learning this disgression in very young schools, so it would eventually come up to being a social disturbance in athiest and non-christian families or communities in the United States. yes, i said all that in one breath. and who listened? oh, everyone. but what did they listen to? ""juu dun gotta say da pledge. sum peeple dun beleev in God."" ARG. someone asked me:

""Do YOU believe in God?"" some. idiot. armenian. fuckhead. nothing against armenians, some of them are very nice. however....

""i refuse to answer that.""

""YOU'RE A DEVIL WORSHIPER!!""

i glared. and if any of you have ever seen me glare. you. know. that. it. strikes. fire. so i glared. i stood up. i got out of my seat and went to the front of the class. i wrote in HUGE letters on the board:

""In the constitution of the United States of America, it says that Religion and State, including but not limited to public schools, public work, entertainment, and GOVERNMENT, be SEPERATED. It is AGAINST THE LAW to preach, pray, or force your beliefs upon others WHILST ON PUBLIC SCHOOL CAMPUS.""

i set the marker down and turned around. my teacher was standing quietly in back with a soft smirk on her face. i looked her in the eye and she gave me one nod. i stepped silently up to the fuck-head's desk, leaned over and got in his face and said clearly, firmly:

""The light that was once given to you will be taken away, for God loves you no more!"" with that, i got my backpack, took the pass out of Mrs. Ciotti's hand, and walked to the Drama class. 

i think as soon as i was out the door i fainted.

DAMN i hate it when they do that.

*sighs...* 

...i miss Josh. ...i wanna die... ...i hate being horny... ...i'm not going back to that class.</lj-cut>

...that felt better...

...i still feel like shit."

I might as well get used to it. I have about two weeks left, which is totally freaky. I have to pack, clean my room, go school supply shopping, and read that book I'm supposed to. But yeah, all I wanna do right now is dance so that's what I'm doing. I'm in a social mood now, and everyone's busy. Sucks. Owell. Wish all y'all well."

I can't even remember the last time I spent 12 hours away from her, much less a whole day. But it's cool, and surprisigly, we aren't tired of each other.

So because of my tiredness and stupidity let me extend a word of advice to all of y'all....if you are my friend currently, be real. Don't be fake. I'm tired of it. And frankly it is so utterly stupid that it's just beyond comprehension. I'm leaving in two months. Most of you I will never see again after that, so just be fucking genuine and sincere for the next two months, ok? I mean honestly. It's just irritating how fake people are.

The overtime exhilaration. Tying up your shoes. Stretching in the weight room before. Putting on the jersey. The shootaround. Everyone pulling for each other. Sticking together through the tough times. The bus rides home. Packing for team camp. Eating together. Having sleepovers. The closing seconds of the game. The big wins and the tough losses. I miss all of it with all of my heart. Sports isn't a casual activity. For those who play it, it's a life."

So far today I haven't really done much. I woke up and watched tv for awhile. Then, I hung out with Jessie. Now, I'm chilling out for another 15 minutes, and then, I have to go graduation dress shopping. Definitely not looking forward to that, but the sooner I get it over with the better. Tomorrow I have to take my government exam, and I think I have to work. Friday I'm going to go to the Tanger Center (with Sami and Jessie?) to buy a bunch of awesome clothes. I can't wait."

"event","Chesleigh Bragg's memorial service at DHS was this morning. Krystle got in a car wreck this morning. She was released from the hospital around 12:00 wearing a temporary back brace and with severe bruising. Krystle was friends with Chesleigh (who died in a car crash about a week ago), and she helped put up the cross with the flowers on the spot where Chesleigh died. This is starting to hit way too close to home. I didn't really know Qjonte or Chesleigh, but a lot of my friends did, and they were a part of the DHS family. Krystle was friends with both of them as a matter of fact. Now, Krystle has gotten hurt, and she is my friend. I still remember trying to console her after Qjonte died. I don't know what's going on, but all this tragedy needs to stop. I don't want to attend any more memorial services.

Tomorrow is my last day of school. I have to go up there to take my Government exam on Tuesday, but that's it. I'm getting real nostalgic and kind of sad. Although I'm really ready for summer, I'm going to miss high school. I mean normally leaving for the summer is not a huge deal. I know I will be playing basketball in the summer, and I know I'll be back in the fall. But this year is different. No more basketball. No more next year as far as Daphne High School is concerned. A lot of people I will only get to see a few more times, and then, never again. After tomorrow, I will never sit in the locker room and joke around with everyone during lunch or break. I will probably never again step foot in the locker room that I helped build. I can't write anymore about it or I'll start crying. Tomorrow during fourth block, all of us seniors will play basketball together on our court for the last time ever. We all have to sign the wall, too. It's a tradition that the girls basketball seniors sign the wall by the painted basketball in our weight room. I don't know if I can put it into words. Tomorrow is just going to be extremely emotional. This is an end of an era."

"event","So, for starters, I'm sick as hell. My nose is messed up, I have a sore throat, I'm sick to my stomach to the point that if I eat anything I will immediately throw it up, everytime I stand up my vision goes black and I feel like I might faint at any moment, I have a fever blister on the inside of my mouth (how can you get it in the inside of your mouth?!), and I started my period. Let's just say I'm not in the best of condition. To top it off, my mom took my car in to get it's oil changed and it's tires rotated, and she got some interesting news. Well, my car has had a little light on the dash that says something is wrong, and we found out what that is. My car is going to cost over $1,000 to fix it. I need two new back tires because they have no tread on it whatsoever and one of them has a nail stuck in it. My front brakes need to be replaced because they're worn out. Something called a tail seal or something like that needs to be fixed because it's leaking transmission fluid. Which means I also have to get my transmission flushed. That caused my throttle to be messed up so they have to fix that, too. And all of that is the reason I've been getting low gas mileage. All of that amounts to $952.71, and then, you have to add in the cost of the oil change and tire rotation. So yeah. Let's just say my family was shocked to find all this out. Luckily, my parents are going to pay for it (as part of my graduation present). So. Yeah. Life just keeps dealing me blows."

"event","For the second time this term, another student from Daphne High School was killed. Chesleigh Bragg died in a car accident yesterday. She was texting Jonathan Huggins and Brittany Burchfield and lost her focus on driving. She went off the road, tried to get back on, went off the other side, and her car flipped. She wasn't wearing her seat belt. Her window was down, and she got caught half in and half out of the window. When the car flipped, it fell on top of her. The other girl was wearing her seat belt, and she lived. She is from Fairhope and is home-schooled. There's mixed reports that she only got a couple of scratches and other reports that she just got out of a coma. As a little side note, Chesleigh and Qjonte were both pictured together on the page in the yearbook for Night of the Living Dead (a play that our drama club did)."

I woke up a little late so I didn't get to eat anything or get gas before I went to work. Work was okay. I had to syle out the New Balance wall (probably the worst job in the entire store). That was not fun. I feel bad for Shakita though, because after I left, she was stuck doing it. During my break, I had to get gas which sucked because I wanted to eat something because I hadn't eaten in over 24 hours and I was hungry. But anyways, after work I followed Matt to USA's library, so I could work on my paper. Thanks Matt for showing me how to get there and helping me. We got there around 4:30ish, and I didn't leave until 8:15. I'm pretty much done. All I have to do is proofread it and make a cover page. I'm pretty relieved. This was the last big thing I had to do for school. So as soon as I turn it in Wednesday, it's going to be smooth sailing. It's gonna be nice. Well, I'm off to bed. Sweet dreams everyone."

So, I've finally made up my mind about it. But I'm going to wait and buy it on Sunday because they might have a special sale or something because it's MLB Opening Night. I'm going to get the home one. It's white, says RED SOX across the chest, and has the #33 on the back. I can't wait!"

She stayed at Tim's last night after we tried for 45 minutes to try to get her to leave with us. We had to take the tequila away from her cuz she was taking shots like it was nothing. She threw her phone in the ocean last night, too. We have to get all the alcohol out of her car before she gets back because it's ours. We all had jello shooters this morning. They were pretty good.

She's dead meat. All of us did all we could to help her out. It's really scary, though. Because all of us were invited to that party. But once the guys asked Shannon, Sonni, and Jackie about what we looked like, and they said we were like 6'0"" and all, the guys said not to invite us. The drink was actually Shannon's, but Sonni ended up drinking it. She's dead. Her step-dad is gonna kill her. They drove her back to Spanish Fort as soon as she got out of the hospital. I don't know. It could have been all of them. And maybe if I had gone there instead, I could have stopped it. It was a horrible situation. But we did some investigating and found out four of the guys names. So, I don't know. It could of been any of us. It's just scary as hell to think about that. I don't know. Some crazy shit could have happened.

"event","I went to get my haircut today. The lady that normal cuts my hair was on vacation. That lady is perfect: always remembers me and always knows exactly how I want my hair cut. Well, this new lady that I've never seen cut my hair. Actually, a better way to say it would be she <i>diced</i> my hair. She cut it 5 inches shorter than I told her to. FIVE FUCKING INCHES! <b><u>I can't put my hair in a ponytail!!!!!</u></b> I always wear my hair in a ponytail, and now I fucking can't. I am beyond pissed. I was so fucking close to killing that lady. It will take FOREVER to grow out. Y'all don't understand how short she cut it. There's guys at our school that have longer hair than I do now. It stops like a centimeter below where my scalp ends. It is fucking horrible! I'm about to shoot somebody."

You'll blame a new love for things an old one did. You'll cry because time is passing too fast, and you'll eventually lose someone you love. So take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like you've never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness you'll never get back.</FONT></SPAN>"

We called a draw after we each had 18 pieces. Let me reiterate...18 PIECES EACH! Over two whole pizzas. And this wasn't on an empty stomach either. We had eaten earlier, too. Needless to say, Sonni and I are dying right now."

"event","I'm an absolute 100% believer in unconditional love, and I personally think that is how everyone should love. Every other way seems fake to me. So, I just can't seem to understand it when I meet people who don't love people unconditionally. They love people based on different circumstances that if they were slightly skewed they wouldn't love those people at all. I just don't understand. To me, if you love someone, you love them until the day you die no matter what."

Plus, it has a big area that has a 52"" tv, ping-pong tables, theater, volleyball court, and BASKETBALL COURT! Oh yeah, there's a basketball court right by my room. <3  I can't wait to get there.

Got so many cool presents, including a huge trophy, that if anybody asks is my MVP trophy. Lol. It was great, but sad at the same time. Daphne, Vigor, and BCHS are in a three-way tie for area champion. I think it'll be a coin toss to figure out who hosts the Area tournament. As long as it's not Vigor, I'm okay. We want to host it and everything, but as long as Vigor doesn't, I'm happy. Only two more regular season games for us (Monday at Citronelle and Tuesday vs. Theodore). *sadness* But it'll all be okay. I'm looking forward to making a good playoff run. <b>GO LADY TROJANS CLASS OF '06 BABY!!!!!!</b>"

"event","We beat Spanish Fort tonight. I don't know what the score was, but we blew them out. I stole the ball and scored. I almost scored again, but it glanced off the rim. Coach Smith actually said the first good thing to me about a game. He commended me for scoring. It was literally the first good thing he has ever said about me in a game. But of course, that happiness didn't last long. We left the Slip-Not at Spanish Fort. I looked for it for ten minutes, and I asked over half the team if they'd seen it or would they help me find it. I never did find it. So, even though I got the shooting shirts, the towels, the balls, the scorebook, both things of water bottles, and everything else, I was blamed for not having the Slip-Not. Coach Smith yelled at me for forever and said I would never play again if we left anything else again. We did go back and get it. So, then when we got back to DHS, I made sure I emptied all the water bottles by myself and tried to grab the towels so I could go home and wash them so I wouldn't get in trouble. But Coach Smith got pissed off at me cause it was taking some time to do all that. So, I got yelled at for that. And then he made a smart ass comment to me that I should've made that second shot because if I had we would have had 80 points. I AM SO FUCKING TIRED OF HIM! I AM SO FUCKING TIRED OF BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING WHILE EVERYONE ELSE DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!"

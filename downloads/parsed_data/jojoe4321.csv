I'm wondering what to do.
I'm crying now with all these lonely words..
I try to understand.
About the things in general
But u tear it all away for no good.

I wanted you to know.
That i'm falling faster then a speeding car....
Sometimes you make me wonder.
When it thunders and rain.
I cry all night and think of you with pain.

When I look at you.
I see that your feeling down.
Please hold your head up high.
and make me smile...
We say that we wanted Better things in life.
but if turned around and looked.
We had it all for each other.
But....

"event","Hello, 

Last night was fun. I went and saw pirates of the carribean at Brewer. Sorta boring. I admit to crying for a couple mins. with my head down.
Not saying why. Because if I did. I just would make everyone be sad because its a bad reason. Anywayz I honestly think I beat a record of violation.
I was violated 100,823 times last night. WOW o.O. Well now i'm bored and nothing to do. Anyone wanna go crazy and wild like last night? /laughs"

The past few weeks Ive gone back and forth a milluion times in my head about staying on SALT.  It is soething I feel God is pushing me to serve with and I want to be able to do that but at the same time inside me is fighting it every bit.  Even the little things in my life right now are messin with me and I dont want SALT to become obligitory.  Well.. maybe its hit the point whereI have to find that balance and realize, like chris said, that ministry isnt always a team, it is placing people where they need to be and sometimes you are one of those people.  I'm still going back and forh with it and I dont want people to think I am letting them down and dropping off of the team because I dont want to put the time into it.  Thats not it at all.  I am afraid the team may think that I'm being lax and don't care but in reality, I really do.  This past week has been hard for me to be at peace with.  I've already talked with Cynthia about it and there's probably one more phone call to her that I will make before tomorrow.  I want the team to  know its nothing anyone of them has said or done.  if anything, they've made me want to stick it out but when it comes down to it, I'm in the middle of a transition and there are things I have to deal with now and put at rest before I  go to college and find that life is about to a ton more complicated and it would be less if i had dealt with those ghosts when I had the chance.  So here's my change and I regret that SALT is the one to go but it is and it's time for me to start to deal. There's not a person there that it doesnt bother me that maybe in some way I've let you down makin this week my last week.

Twenty four oceans
Twenty four skies
Twenty four failures
Twenty four tries
Twenty four finds me
In twenty-fourth place
Twenty four drop outs
At the end of the day
Life is not what I thought it was
Twenty four hours ago

Still I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You
And I'm not who I thought I was twenty four hours ago
Still I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You

Twenty four reasons to admit that I'm wrong
With all my excuses still twenty four strong

See I'm not copping out not copping out not copping out
When You're raising the dead in me
Oh, oh I am the second man
Oh, oh I am the second man now
Oh, oh I am the second man now

And You're raising these twenty four voices
With twenty four hearts
With all of my symphonies
In twenty four parts
But I wan to be one today
Centered and true

I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You
You're raising the dead in me
Oh, oh I am the second man
Oh, oh I am the second man now
Oh, oh I am the second man now
And You're raising the dead in me

I want to see miracles, see the world change
Wrestled the angel, for more than a name
For more than a feeling
For more than a cause
I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You
And You're raising the dead in me
Twenty four voices
With twenty four hearts
With all of my symphonies
In twenty four parts.
I'm not copping out. Not copping out. Not copping out.

On Fire lyrics

 Tell you where you need to go
Tell you when you'll need to leave
Tell you what you need to know
Tell you who you need to be

But everything inside you knows
Says more than what you've heard
So much more than empty conversations
Filled with empty words

And you're on fire
When He's near you
You're on fire
When He speaks
You're on fire
Burning at these mysteries

Give me one more time around
Give me one more chance to see
Give me everything You are
Give me one more chance to be... (near You)

Cause everything inside looks like
Everything I hate
You are the hope I have for change
You are the only chance I'll take

When I'm on fire
When You're near me
I'm on fire
When You speak
And I'm on fire
Burning at these mysteries
these mysteries...

I'm standing on the edge of me [x3]
I'm standing on the edge

And I'm on fire
When You're near you
I'm on fire
When You speak
(Yea) I'm on fire
Burning at these mysteries...	 
	
switchfoot- on fire"

What makes you stay when your world falls apart? What makes you try one more time when it isnt in your heart? At the end of your rope, when you can't find any hope, You still look at them and say, 'I just can't walk away'... Tell me why you stay...

You could cut ties with all the lies you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again I would understand
I would understand""


""I'm feeling weak and weary walking 
through this world alone
Everything you say, every word of it, 
cuts me to the bone, and I bleed
I've got something to say, but now I've got no where to turn
It feels like I'm been buried underneath 
all the weight of the world
I'm blind and shakin
Bound and breaking
I hope I make it through"""

Finding nothing but questions and devils

Suddenly turn from blue to grey
Till one by one the raindrops
Turned to tears upon your face

But I've never felt so helpless

There's something holding on to you so tight
So I guess this is all I'll say to you tonight

You believed in me when I couldn't see my strength. You picked me up and showed me I could be myself.. You showed me how to be me and now you are so far away sometimes I wonder if you are even here anymore

Anyone can give up, it's the easiest thing in the world to do. But to hold it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart, that's true strength.

What makes you stay when your world falls apart? What makes you try one more time when it isnt in your heart? At the end of your rope, when you can't find any hope, You still look at them and say, 'I just can't walk away'... Tell me why you stay...

ANCHOR
artist: Lifehouse
c.d.: Stanley Climbfall

I stand with a blank expression now
And I can't believe myself
Would someone tell me
How did I get here

I am walking
Changing slowly
I am chasing
Climbing closer

I know that I'll never be alone
You will never let me go
You are my anchor
Hold my hand
While I'm sinking in the sand
No one else could understand
You are my anchor

It seems that I lost track of time
And I can't believe my mind
Would you save me
If I reached out to you

I am waiting,
Watching, standing
I am reaching

"event","So I've been home for five days now.. Seems strange.. but if you wanna know about camp just ask me. I'm too sleepy to actually write it all out anyhow.. 

Anyway, I'm home. Things are still here. Some things changed. Some things stayed the same. Some got worse. That's the bends and breaks of life. Somehow I wish I were back at camp, safe in the little bubble that was Burrito Brothers 2004 and not have any of this around me.  I feel like I was safe there, like nothing in reality was there, nothing to tear at my mind like there is here. There my focus was where it was supposed to be. There I was happier and felt safer than I do here. I guess I'm just trying to readjust and deal with everything here. 

I dunno.. I guess the biggest thing about being at BBFYC was that there was always someone around. Someone was always there. People were every where and we were all in it together. Somehow I felt more open, more me there.. I felt like I could be who I really am and not be judged for it.  No one looked at me like I'm strange because the way my family is. No one except for a few people knew the situation and it wasn't brought up.  I didn't have anyone telling me how my mom and  sister are going to hell.. had no one in my face saying that I am  wrong for not being clearly against it. Maybe I'm not meant for this whole student leadership thing. Maybe I'm not straightened out enough in my head to be the person I should be.. maybe i'm just not straightened out enough to deal with things.. May be I'm just as messed up as people told me.  Maybe I am.. maybe I'm not..

I miss hanging out with people at camp.. There I was around people 
constantly and was breaking out of my shell then I come home and 
it's like everyone is super super busy working summer jobs and doing
the whole friends scene and family times.. I dunno.. It's one of my 
distance myself from my friends times coming on again.. The biggest bulk of people I'm close with are all leaving me soon and I don't know how to deal with that.. The ones who are still here are rarely around much anymore and that's okay.. I just miss hanging out with everyone.

I leave you with this thought

I try hard to make it./I just want to make you proud/never gonna be good enough for you./Can't pretend that I'm alright./And you can't change me/ 
We've lost it all/nothing lasts forever/I'm sorry I can't be perfect./ Now its just too late/ and we can't go back/ i can't be perfect..

------------------
When I say out loud i want to get out of this/ I wonder is there anything I'm gonna miss.."

"event","Someone brought it to my attention that I hadn't updated in a while.. Well, indeed I hadn't.  I've been super busy lately with school wrapping up, graduation, gettin ready to go to Rockbridge (gonna be an awesome time!!!).. 

I've been doing okay. School is out and I'm technically a senior.. One Question.. why doesn't it feel that way? It doesn't feel any different than any other year or anything like that.. Guess it hasn't really sunk in yet..   

My mom got her POA a month or so ago.. I'm not to sure what to do with that.. Not many people really know the whole situation. So if you don't know the situation I appologize now for any confusion my little vent may  cause.. 

My mom- rar.. Since I've moved out she's made very few attempts to spend any time with me other than for holidays and my birthday.. and even my birthday was like it was a task for her to be there or something. I don't know.. I've gotten used to her not being around but I still wish she would call me instead of me having to call her all the time. And i wish my parents could be in the same room without having to be on opposite sides because they dont get along. I don't get it.. Why can't all three of them just GROW UP and be ADULTS. She's always saying she is busy or has something to do this night or that or is tired or had a bad day and doesn't want to do anything.. and it kills her to talk to me for more than five minutes on the phone.. but lately that has gotten bettter. Our conversations tend to be initaited by me and last for a whole ten minutes now- improving.
Evidentally they are planning to go out of town for      a week with out telling me.. Nice. Good one mom.. Go AWOL and not care that you didn't tell me.. supposedly She and her girlfriend are taking a week and visiting where they want. Great! Have fun.. They are going to PA. for a few days.. and didnt ask if I would like to go see my family that I get to see maybe once a year if that. So I'm a little bitter.. 

She used to spend so much time with us. I loved it. I loved spending nights just sitting on the porch doing nothing but watching the traffic or staring at the moon but now.. even that's too much to ask.  I just wish she would be my mom and want to spend time with me. I don't know what I ever did to make her not want to spend time withme but my plans to stay there friday night have since been killed.. seeing as I don't have a bed room any more (It's an office now) and they have some concert for her girlfriend's sister to attend.. but no  she can make all the time in the world for that but not for an evening with me.. yeah.. so I'm angry and probably shouldn't be but.. I just wanna spend time with my mom and that's too much to ask of her.  I leave for a week on Sunday and when I leave I doubt she is at the bus to say have a good time. Yeah.. She won't be there.  That would make the parent side show in her and not the twenty year old attitude..    okay. vent over.

So I made the S.A.L.T. team at church and am super excited.. I'm taking The Greatest Among You to camp with me so I dont get behind in my book.. IT's only been going a week but has been a good motivation for me to spend more time in quiet times and reading my bible more. Plus, I'm getting to know my Youth pastor and his wife a lot better and his wife doesn't intimidate me anymore.. Actually, I'm gonna meet with her this week to talk for a little bit. 

Anyway. I'm gonna go-

That group of kids absolutely amaze me.  They are all so.. great.  It was one of the most awesome things I've ever seen to hear an eight year old say we should pray for the little girl who got sick while she was there. When Laura said she wanted to pray for her I was blown away. These are seven to nine year olds and it was so amazing to hear that.  I can look at the way society is and rejoice because even as messed up as the world is, not all children are being corrupted by it.  Hearing the children pray for a fellow peer at such a young age was indescribable. This probably doesn't make sense.  Joey had come in to help with snacks and the look on his face was complete awe. I had the same look. It's seeing the children who have such a love for people and each other that gives me hope for them. I still ache for the children who are getting destroyed by the way things are but I'm in awe of them at the same time.  They grow up learning so much strength.  Wow.. I don't know how else to explain that.  I absolutely love hearing children praise God.  I loved working with the kids this weekend.  They are such a blessing.

"event","<P>It's been a while since I actually wrote something more in here than just a quote or song lyrics. It seems like everything is going on at once or something is always pulling me somewhere else other than here. School is school. I'm definately behind in tech and comp but that's okay. I might get done tomorrow or the next day hopefully tomorrow. I dunno. I'll be glad when this project is done and turned in. The band concert is in a week and there are still a lot of things that need to be worked on musically with concert band.. I've been doing alright I guess, minus Sunday night. That's a long story that I'm not sure I want to get into. People know who need to know. I can't say how grateful I am for the people in my life. I'm not sure where I'd be if it weren't for them (you know who you are). I don't think I want to go to youth by my self again. don't want to get into that. Things are a lot different and somethings still hit home a little too closely. Lately I've felt like pulling away from everything, spacing myself away from people. I don't really know why. Hit a breaking point, came to some hard realizations, still confused and somewhere still a little numb. I wish I could get my mom to actually talk to me for more than five minutes. I know she is busy or is always headed out the door or something but sometimes I just miss talking to her. She's not that far away physically but emotionally I feel like we are strangers. I get frustrated when she makes up excuses for things or half reasons half lies not to go to something I have going on. I feel like if I didn't call her I wouldn't hear from her. I'm worried though. Lately I've been in constant fear that she would get sick again. I don't know why I'm complaining when there are people who have worse situations. I'm going to the living free in Christ confrence my church is holding this week. It sounds really intresting. Anyhow, I should be going... the first three chapters of October Sky are calling my name even though I really don't want to read them. Even though it doesn't seem like it from my post I'm in a pretty good mood. -------------------------------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Pieces of you --</P>

If Jesus walked into your school tomorrow, who would be talking to? Just something to think about.

"event","It's been a while since I updated. This week has been really good for the most part. School is going well. Fourth block is still hard but that's okay. The Jazz band got a Superior rating. YAY!!! What else.. Friday I found out I had a C in Creative Writing. That was all my fault though. I got behind and am still playing catch up, lol. Had an awesome convesation with Kayla last night about some stuff... It felt great to talk with It's been a while since I updated. This week has been really good for the most part.

That was all my fault though. I got behind and am still playing catch up, lol. Anyhow.. Today has been so awesome. First off woke up at 4:30 this morning and have been awake since. My dad and I went to church this morning. God's presence was so strong today. All through worship it was like nothing I'd ever felt. Lately I'd been drifting away from little things like having quiet time everyday and prayer and starting to doubt things a little again but this morning wiped all that away. I can't explain it really but This morning was one of the best things I've ever felt. that. Anyhow.. Today has been so awesome. First off woke up at 4:30 this morning and have been awake since.

Lately I'd been drifting away from little things like having quiet time everyday and prayer and starting to doubt things a little again but this morning wiped all that away. I can't explain it really but This morning was one of the best things I've ever felt. Kayla and I decided to try FSM again tonight and I'm really glad I did. As soon as I got there I felt like I was there for a reason other than just going, like God planned it for me to be there tonight. I saw a few kids there that ride my bus and tried to make it a point to tell them I was glad they had came. Chris's message tonight was out of Luke 4 and how Jesus's ""mission statement"" was to speak the gospel to the poor. By poor I don't mean those who are just monetarily poor but those who feel broken, hurting, missing something, beaten down. Those who are desitute in ways not just physically. They talked about annointment and how it was used and offered a challenge to us for us to go and talk to those who are ""poor."" To witness to them our faith and the Gospel and of the love God has for them and how they can be like the prodigal son and return home to their father and how they can feel that love. Chris challenged us with that and said on the count of three for us to stand who accepted that challenge and that the adult staff had annointment oil and that they wanted to annoint us for this purpose like in the bible. I stood up and it was just undescribable. Just knowing that even I have the capability to influence someone into a decision like giving their life to Christ is beyond words for me. Kayla and I stood and as dumb as it probably sounds it was incredibly comforting to have her make that choice too. We were standing there praying as the adults were going around and I felt like i can do this. Like even if I get made fun of for my faith it's a welcome thing because that just gives another opportunity to witness. Anyhow kayla and I were sitting there in prayer holdings hands and it was a comfort to have her there with me. I know that if she hadn't gone that I wouldnt have been there and I would reget not going but we went and it was undescribable. It just awesome. I definately think I'm going back next week. I hope everyone has a safe week. love, megan"

"event","Today has been great. It was so nice outside. I loved it. I finally for a chance to be outside and spend time around the people I love, doing what is important to them. I spent three or so hours with my uncle just talking and digging forms for concrete.  I love when I get to talk to him because he doesnt talk down to me. He talks to me like I'm an equal to him.  He keeps telling me to take advantage of every opportunity I get in life and that I should take school seriously but have fun and yeah.. He's great. Since I moved back to the farm, I've found so much more joy in small things. Seeing Jamie running around and playing with P and Kristen. It reminds me of when I was younger and how we would play for hours in the barn lot, content with our boundaries from the pine tree to the oak tree on the road and never questioning that. It made me think of the times we used to play basketball in the hay loft and spotlight until midnight. It reminded me how much time I used to spend with my sister, Chris, Amanda, Davey, and Amy.  It brought back  a lot of good memories and some sad but hey.. you'll always have that.  I was thinking about my grandfather and how he used to be out at the barn about every day and how he was always tinkering with something and it made me kinda sad. I miss him so much. The farm seems kinda empty and lacking something without him here. I saw my uncle playing with P and thought how lucky she is that she still has all of her grand parents and that he takes the time out from working on the farm to play with them and spend that time with them. I only hope she knows how special it is. 

I went out to Frank and Tammy's today after spending time with my uncle and hung out there with her for a little while. Her grandson is three and so adorable. She raises miniature horses and had one in the barn that she lets her grandson put on a lead line and walk around infront of the garage. He was so cute to watch with the horse. He's only three and when the horse would stop walking and not want to follow him he kept calling it little dude and stubborn.. it was cute. 

This week has been really hectic but good. I really wish this whole big controversey of gay marriages would just stop. I don't understand how giving them the right to legally marry is a threat to traditional marriage.  I mean we have a state that has drive through marriage chapels.. Atleast these couples want to stay together and want to be married and love each other from their hearts not from some drunken state of mind.. . ""All men are created equal""- basically if you are white, straight, and middle class and up.. Sorry. That's my little vent.

Going to see The Passion tomorrow.. I'm really excited to see it. 

Nite,

"event","Today has been really long.  It was one of those days that never ends, ya know, the ones that somehow break the laws of time and physics to gradually take much longer than 90 minutes for classes to pass, yet magically, makes youth pass at supersonic speeds? Yeah.. Its been one of those but anyhow the past few days have been awesome.

Thursday I went to Mo-town for my audition for seatings for WVU Honor Band. It started yucky when I opened my case to reveal a very chipped reed, so I played my audition on an old one that gave little sound.. Went Friday early to find out seatings.

I ended up getting first out of five chairs.. YAY for me.. Worked with Professor Criter on the music. She was a lot of fun minus the rehersal tempo of 180 on IV. Gallop. It made for an intresting read for sure.  Culloden III was awesome.  It is a scottish piece about the battle of Coulloden (sp? forgive me it's been a long day and I can't spell.. lol). The Performance Hall at WVU is amazing. The acoustics there let sound just echo.. Yeah.. I'm a dork..

We had the concert on Saturday. My Mom didn't go, though that wasn't much of a suprise but I'll not go there. The concert went really well for only having a day and 3 hours to prepare the music. P.C. asked us how many were music majors and 80% of us raised our hands. When she asked how many were honors students 75% of us raised our hands. It was really cool to see that many dedicated high school students. She definately left us with some ideas and thoughts that, if we choose, can impact us a lot. It was really cool to hear her say she was proud to have the honor to direct us when really I feel like it was my honor to work with her. Afterwards when we got home and everything settled, we went over to Vicky's and shot pool for a while. J.D. and D.J. came to pick Matthew up. He kicked my butt at pool severly.  He's only 14 and has a 1200 on his SATs... That kinda makes me feel stpid when I barely got a 22 on my ACT. Oh well.. He's a genius. 

Sunday I went to church and my dad wanted to go instead of run errands and stuff which was really really cool. I love how he has started to go to church on his own will and everything. Went back Sunday night and was baptised. More to come about that later.. the bunch from young life were there and my parents were even being civil.. It was awesome.. Molly, Amanda, Kayla, Clev and John were there. In all I think there were 8 of us get baptised. It was definaly one of the best things I've ever felt. Amanda was at the door to the sanctuary after I got baptised and the first thing I did was give her a hug. She didnt care even though I was very wet and cold. She's awesome like that. Clev and Kayla stood and prayed with me and that was just one of the best feelings in the world. 

Clev- Thank you so much for going last night. It meant   a lot to me that you came up and prayed with/ for me.. 

John and Molly- You guys have been the greatest leaders anyone could ever ask for. there are so many reasons why I love you guys.

Kayla-  Thanks for being there and for fall weekend and everything after. I was so glad you came up with Clev and prayed to.. It really means a lot to me. 

Amanda- What can I say.. You're awesome. Thank you so much for going and everything you've done for me. You're Awesome!!!!!

To everyone who was there- Thanks and I pray that maybe one person's decision could start a fire or a spark in your heart, for a yearning to know Jesus Christ to take hold and grow in you. 


Today was up and down but its okay because 
we had young life tonight and that makes me happy. I played with Annalesse before club started. She is so adorable. I never would have imagined 19 people would fit in John's car... Great fun... Great fun..  I found out I'm eligable to apply for National Honors society or something like that.  When school let out it was so beautiful outside. The sun was shining, and the sky was really pretty blue. I talked to my uncle when I got off the bus for a little bit then went up and was petting Lady and Cinnamon. Cinnamon is getting a lot better with people. He's still kind of skiddish and if you sneak up on him he gets spooked really easily but Jamie is getting better about making sure the horse sees him before he reaches to pet him and to go slowly and gently with them. I'm amazed at what I see when I look around here. I'm so blessed and fortunate for everything. 

Last night it really hit me how blessed I am. I can look around and always see someone who I know cares and I'm so thankful for everyone in my life. I really strongly believe that everyone is where they are for a reason and it's what you take out of it that matters. I'm so blessed and thankful everyday for my friends and family. I'm really lucky that I've been given these people in my life and I don't want to let them down. 

Wow.. This is really long.. Sorry-

in his love,
nite"

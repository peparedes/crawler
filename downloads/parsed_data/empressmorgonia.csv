"event","Hey there -- I was surprised to see how many of you are still using LiveJournal and so glad to read about your lives from my lonely 116th street temp room.  The whole of Columbia/Barnard moved out just in time for me to bring my stuff down the hall and take to my bed for 48 hours with a nasty head cold, and the complete isolation I've been in - and to be fair, I slept 22 of the last 24 hours - has made me put everything in perspective, reevaluate, and make a mental list of everyone I've got to call or write or bring flowers to, or all of the above.  There are a lot of you.

Is anyone left in the city?  I'm in New York until June 2, and seriously, I know no one.  I'm reading one of Alain de Botton's novels, and there's a passage that really struck me when the heroine remarks that if she tripped and fell off the earth, no one would really notice.  She's also lovelorn and very melancholy.  We have quite a bit in common.

Anyway -- this is just to say that I'm very much missing you all and enjoyed reading your most recent posts (catching up a little bit) and that I'll be excited to see you at home this summer.  Until then, I'll be holed up fighting this nasty cold, watching Tricia Walsh-Smith's YouTube videos and wishing I knew how to write plays.  Maybe if I'm feeling particularly gutsy, I'll take myself out to see ""Saved!""  Provided that I no longer have to breathe out of my mouth.

I miss you.  I love you.

"event","Greetings from exotic Poughkeepsie, New York!  Vassar is beautiful, but the only thing I miss as much as my friends and family is air conditioning.  If being trained to be a playwright means learning to live without unnecessary pleasures - and as long as, unlike the professionals, we can be guaranteed a place to live and dinner on the table - then I am willing to make the sacrifce.

I just returned from the second of five readings here as part of the Powerhouse program.  Vassar and New York Stage & Film produce a theatre series each summer composed of readings of new works, world premieres, and workshops and invite about 40 apprentices to work and study under the watch of the countless actors, directors, stage managers, technicians, and playwrights running on and off campus over a busy six weeks.  And I have never felt more ignorant in my entire life.  If you think you know the theatre type, you've never met the people I've come to know here, whose knowledge of classical and comtemporary work, actors, directors, producers, technique and theory is so expansive that they really do seem - and I say this in the very best possible way - to have dropped off another planet.

I was only eager to send my regards to all of you - I miss my home and friends like crazy, especially Johnnycake vets and contemporaries - from this very bizarre and professional place where I'll be spending the next five weeks.  My first piece, ""An Amorous Discourse (in eight minutes or less),"" premieres tomorrow, and I am quite excited.  

Hope you're doing well.  Love and best wishes, as always ~ m"

"event","My head makes a funny sort of creaking noise when I turn it.  I'm pretty sure that's a good sign of sleep deprivation.  I'm also pretty sure that over the last two months, I've brushed off not only my creaks and pains but also my newly-surfacing quirks with the wonderfully vesatile sleep-deprivation excuse.  

Hey, LiveJournal friends, I have something to remind you, and I think the second-semester-junior creaks were simply God's way of reminding me.  Come two weeks from now, every one of you will have left me here, in the dust, alone and lost in the newly-renovated storied cloisters.  And though I'm sure that you'll <i>ever-mindful be</i> of what greatness St. John's has so lovingly hammered into you, you needn't forget your little friend who followed in your footsteps and added her commentary to your sagely LJ posts.

I will miss you dearly, Class of '06.  I think that's what I've really been eager to say all along.  And to my friends from '05, I can't wait to see you again.  SJS without the two classes preceeding mine will be a radically different place than it was a year ago, one without the energy and talent that made me love this place to begin with.

On another note, Matt failed to mention that his tireless work for The Laramie Project really, really shows, even with lines unlearned (my lines unlearned, I might add, lines that will be learned quite soon).  His devotion is absolutely astounding, and I think it really comes across.  You really ought to come see it on Saturday.  For now, I'm surrendering myself to Tycho Brahe and the Copernican Revolution in hopes that the grade I make on the Modern European AP exam will exceed the number of days from until the show, which - egads - is a challenge on dual fronts.  With love, always ~ m"

"event","Apparently a few of you read this!  I'm really flattered.  So I thought I'd start out with a rewarding little piece of information I obtained courtesy of reference.com:

Did you know that the list of rejected Dwarf names for the 1939 film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"" includes Wheezy, Puffy, Baldy, Jumpy, Gabby, Nifty, Stumpy, Stuffy, and Biggo-Ego?

Just thought you might find that as intruiging as I did.

My Camry, believe it or not, is going to be repaired.  And I'm completely shocked - I'm not sure anything under the hood is salvagable, although maybe the mess wasn't as melted as it looked last time I saw it.  It looked pretty bad.  I think I'll take the bus driver who put my car out a Christmas gift when we get back to school.  And also learn his name.

I really appreciated your responses to that ""Respond with a memory of me"" meme!  Since all of that was screened, I'm going to respond to you without naming you (because it's in the same vein and because it's just fun): I called you Al?  I can't believe I'm revamping that club after logging so many wasted hours!  We were always the only ones to set up those chairs.  I was so shocked when you didn't realize I was new!  Hey, sign up for the book fair again this year so we can chat again!  Yep, still hate Valentine's Day.  It was so great having hot chocolate with you again.  Let me drive you home again sometime so we can have even more bushels of fun.  Next time we go to Spain, we should have gofres together.  And Anonymous, I'd love to hear more from you.

"event","2:30 a.m. and my caffeine of choice is Silk Soylatte.  I've cranked out two pies and twelve ""tartletts,"" made a mess of the kitchen, and determined that sleep on the night before Thanksgiving is really rather unnecessary - after all, everyone consumes more under extreme exhaustion, and I may just save myself from that last turkey sandwich in mid-January by keeping myself up another hour tonight. My father's got the right idea.  He's still planning on seasoning the turkey sometime before dawn.

For someone who seriously lost her car in the Edwards Cinema parking garage tonight - and not just her car, mind you, but her mother's car, which was NOT melted in an unfortunate Monday morning near-catastrophe - it's a miracle these pies came out at all.  I am pleased to report that not once did I burn my hand on the stove or my tongue on a half-baked tartlett.  No, another burn is not what I need (it's not a hickey on my face, thank you).  I am ever-so-pleased that I did find my car in time enough to shuffle to Pappasito's and plead with that policeman - someone really ought to have subdued him with a margarita - and see the lovely Miss French.  Katie, it is always a pleasure.  I apologize for the bizarre state in which I came and left this evening; I had pie on my mind and was thinking, ""My word, if that policeman knew the Frenches, he would certainly understand.""  

I was thinking of something corny and trite I could say about being thankful for all of you, my LiveJournal friends (plus John Allman, who is swell enough to read my LJ even though he doesn't have one of his own), but I'll refrain.  This time of year I tend to slip up into tryptophan-induced sentimentality.  So it's not that I don't love you - it's that the chemicals are talking.

All kidding aside, I really am so grateful for all of you.  Happiest of Thanksgivings, and much love~

Hi guys.

Spain, for all of you I haven't spoken (rambled, raved) to, was one of the most phenomenal experiences I've had.  I really believe that you can go with a school group, be a tourist, share the experience with a friend, but the very best way is to fly solo in a group of strangers and struggle - and, by accident, learn a heck of a lot more than you ever would sitting in a desk.  It's such a shame that I was homesick and have now rediscovered the mediocrities of life on this side of the Atlantic.  But maybe it's just a mood I'm in.

I certainly appreciated all of your warm greetings, your birthday messages, instant messages, phone calls over the last few days.  You're so good to me and I miss you all.  Let me know if you're bored and I'll be bored with you.  Or we'll ride the Metro Rail all day and watch people get on and off or gleefully squander an evening away watching the worst movies we can find.  Or something else fun.  I'll keep thinking.

Love always."

Really.  :-)  

Thanks for everything.  Love always ~

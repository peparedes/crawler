Its like up to chin, or a little higher. Rawrg, I think I am going to have Ice cream. Oh yea, before that, I am going off to Homecoming, with my best friend Bella. I don't think Matt really wanted to go. Which is fine, as much as I would have loved to gone with him, his friend who he hasn't seen in for a while is coming up (probably) and so I'm not going to try and pry him from that, besides, Bella and I had this planned from a long time ago, and I don't like breaking commitments. Ok, now I want my ice cream."

I'm so focused on things that revolve around something other than the world wide web that its just taken my focuse away. I will say that I am weirded out by my life, like, its just that, I am sorta sad, but otherwise decently happy. I also decied that self portrairts are the definition of evil, because I just can't just capture myself. Though I will admit its fun to render my self in different ways. Most people say I look like a elf from Lord of the Rings. Which I find entertaining to no end. Well, I think I am going to take off. Be satisfied that I cared to update.

I also have aquired a nice set of prisma color and am looking forward to sitting and drawing all day long (most likely tomarrow) and then I also look forward to hang with friends.

"event","Animania was both great and the max suckage. Great was playing DDR with Kramer early before and I have to give a big THANK YOU BRO BRO!!I LOVE YOU!! He knows why. Then it was normal, which I didn't like what they were showing and I said eh to bleach which was supposed to be wow and all that. I just was no, I don't feel like going in there and sat around on the other side where all the gothy
ok, goth translate here to all the smokers who I wish didn't smoke and those who are pretty cool and decent and such. So sitting there drawing, I meet some more people, one of which dragged me twice, first time was because he had stolen one of my drumstick and wouldn't let go and niether would I so I was dragged from that. The second time was when I lying down and some how manage to gather five more people lying next to me with out me saying a word. which was a little akward. On the other hand my drawing turned out better than I thought I would so that was good, hahaha. What sucked is Roxanne wasn't there which made me a little sad because I wanted to hang out with her. And then Tom was there, which just made everything seem like the world was about to crumble into a million zillion piece and I'd be crushed by them all and I would saty there for enternal doom for the fact that I could die anytime but it was so slow I could never remember anythingand I would fade into nothingness. Which Of course means I acted eitherlike a dope (which always fun when explaining stories)or I Look sad and lonely and distant which apperently I was so sad by Rena. Thanks to them though for coming over and talking to me, that was nice of them. Lets see...oh oh! And them creepest thing happened, some twenty five year old was hitting on me! GROSS GROSS GROSS GROSS WAS HE! He looked a little gay, and then the worst thing of all, he tried to kiss me! EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!
I'm glad I have aleast a little strength and push him back by which time he got the message but he still would come and bother kramer and I from time to time which is just annoying and by later time Mariee Told me he tried hitting on her but I'm not sure to what degree. Kramer and I decided he was a little drunk. But not drop dead drunk but we thought we smeeled a little alcohol which would explain a bit of things. *shutter* it was so weird. Last time a drunk on me was at the grizzly peak and it was infront of my mom. I used my megatokyo book to swap him away. I need a bigger object. Anybody have anything suggestens? Well, I'm out. Nobody that I want to hang out with is here because they are all doing something with thier bfs or gfs or are in another state attending weddings. So blah."

Friday was decent, it started out really great and progessively got better till it fell off a cliff. I totally got to skip the MLK assembely because I went to the power center to see a guy named dj spooky. Who, remixed Birth of a Nation live which was absolutly awesome because it was such the greatest music I have heard in a long time. It was pretty good, even for something as confusing as it was, because I know the movie glorifies the KKK but this remix gave both sides. Which was a little weird ya know? But no doubt amazing! I even saw my twin! Because alot of people went to this and I missed most of them unfortunatly but I saw some of them. Then I didn't have to do anything when I got back except show up to class. My drum lesson is where it got worse because I had alot of bulit up anger so I was like BLAH!!!!!  And then it got where I broke everything in my body because my mom was shitty too and so she threw a sandwich in Jimmy Johns. Then my DDR session got called off and then the movie we started to watch SUCKED! But then watching Rain Man solved everything. Thats about my friday. Saturday, I spent 9 friggin hours downtown. Which half of it was spent hanging out with Tadd. That was absolutly amazing!!!!! ^_^ Its fun hanging out with people outside of school because its different... hard to explain (I need to make a elf hat!!!! and buy some socks!!!!!!) Then the Rest of it was spent down at petes playing DDR with Kramer and Nate (hack gag gag on you nate) and that was fun playing ddr all that long. Then lets mesa see I sat and watched anime all day long and then I watched legally blond. and am now watching LOTR ROTK. So Pax

Sam, Bob, Fish, and Cassie I love you all! Then I came home, and later I went to go play some ddr with kramer and we went to wizzywig and I saw my bro, I always love seeing him and I'm glad I can see him more often now. The ddr was great. Even though I still can't pass saints. I can pas my summer love, which kramer could not, which made me feel very proud (even though he bests me most of the time) and then I saw Sherie ( I hope thats how she spells her name) she is, sean's friend's girlfriend, and she is really nice and it was nice to talk to her. Then I watched bend it like beckham, which I like even though I hate soccer. I'm listening to relient k so it helps but I'm getting all foo which is no good you know? and Then Talking to Tadd is fun, We do have to make pancakes some time, and I am not sure if we did decide on rasberry or not... hahaha."

So I am sitting in my room listening to meteora right? My brother knocks on my door and  this is the conversation we had:

Kyle:which cd are you listening to?
Me: Meteora
Kyle: Is it my copy?
Me: No
Kyle: Your copy?
Me: Yes
Kyle: Do you know where my copy is?
Me: Nope
Kyle: Do you know where Reanimation is?
Me: On top of the computer
Kyle: Do you know why it's there?
Me: No
(we go down stairs to get it)
(hands cd to Kyle)
Kyle: This is Hybrid theory
Me: well then, I have no clue where Reanimation is.
Kyle: It's the orange-ish one....
Me: No clue.

Unfortunatly, I don't borrow his cds as often as he thinks, and linkin park I have a many friend who like them, and is why my copy of meteora is burned and soooo, I'd only borrow cds I know my friend would not have. Which I do put back.
I posted this just because its funny to me. I don't care if people thinks it dumb."

It was very nice, even though half the time I didn't talk and I just kinda couldn't figure out anything to say...oh well...I also called Sean that night too, but I only got his voice box. So I left a short message (wish I could have said more buuuuuuuuuuut My mother didn't know I was on the phone and she would not Have liked it if she had found out I called him because she's the uber pig). Then my christmas was just another day, only with gifts. Which, Kelly got a digital camera!!!!!!!\/\/007! | (an'7 831i3v3 h0w 600d i7 7i5 70! (and kelly just had a spaztic moment too...). Otherwise, little fun gifts. Also I got one of the coolest rings ever, it's not usually my style, but its a green onyx stone and gold. Only the stone has carvings in it to make it look like a scarab, wow, my mother can be awesome at times... the stones a bit big but hey, it's awesome, besides I can always put it on a necklace chain and wear it around my neck. THAT REMINDS ME! KELLY FOUND HER COLLAR!!!WOOT!Kroger card and all. I love it sooo! *giggles* But now I have a phrase stuck in my head that the cd that my brother got me has on it...it goes like this:

You were a prophet from above
Then you came and sucked my blood
My pain became my strength

"event","Well, today had its definite ups and downs. we'll list the down points first:

-I didn't get hang out with Tom
-I had to clean the house
-Had to shovel the driveway
-Half of my day was wasted
-I couldn't play ddr downtown

Ups:
-I got to see my best friend
-I got a free shirt
-I had substantial food for dinner
-I played ddr at her house on a new pad
-I might go sledding tomorrow
-Tom might show up tomorrow

So thats that. I was thinking of my Sis today, I need to talk to her. I also need to talk to my Bro. I also need their address because I need to get their gifts to them because I haven't seen them lately. which is like blah, because I miss them so dearly. I need to call a lot of people just because it would be nice to talk to them. So yea... I might not because I might not have time....oh well. Pax ya'll. Teehee"

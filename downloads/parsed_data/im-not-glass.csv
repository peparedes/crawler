But we were walking around at about 11 at night and there were 5 fucking cops parked at a house down my street. But a popo lives there anyway so i wasnt too worried. But we were walking down west road and i bent my head to light a cigarette and a fucking cop shined his spot light on us! Fucking bright as shit! He turned it off and drove on...i guess i passed for 18, lol. Anyway we were sitting under the bridge and we saw 10 popos drive by in a matter of 10-15 minutes...that was creepy. We walked back and there were only two cops at the end of my street. So we went back to my house and sat around. I went to bed around 2-3 am. I was tired as shit...and guess what happend to me when i woke up...i had my cell phone in my hand and i had written a text message saying ""whats up?"" and i didnt even know i did that shit...i didnt know who i was going to send it too either.

We woke up around 11 and left at around 11:30-11:45 (some time around there) to go get Ashlee so we could go to the Ruby Rabbit. Its actually a really bad ass store! You should go there heh. Garett didnt know how to get there so Ash drove and when we got there the guy that was at the counter looked like a flat chested chick...im dead serious! He looked really anxious/stressed about something cause he kept pacing back and forth. Ash got a dozen insence which all smelt pretty good. There was this one called ""Fizzy Pop"" or something like that...it actually smelled like the name! It was crazy as shit. After we did that we dropped Ash off and me and Garett went off and did our own thing at his house for about an hour. Then...we got into the car...AGAIN! Iv been in the car so much today I could be Cancoon! Gee...I wish I was so I could get away from all this bullshit. Anyway...we went and picked up Sarah and Amy and dropped amy off at a chick-fil-a so she could get picked up by one of her friends. We dropped Sarah off at a nail salon so she could do her own thing for about an hour and a half then drove alllll the way back to my house got some money from my mother dearist and gave Garett 10 bucks for gas then bought 2 packs of cigarettes and a subway sandwich...damn that shit was delectable. Well then we went back got Sarah then I got dropped off at Ashlee's. Then we went to Lowes to pick up her brother Jake and one of his friends...damn they were both stoned off their ass lol.

I saw her when I walked into school and she said ""Ouch, I hit the pole on the stairs coming down."" I kinda chuckled and walked off, knowing that Kip would be around her any minute. I went to where I usually sit and surprisingly not a lot of people where there today. I didnt really care though, I chilled w/ Jake for a couple of minutes and Cortney walked up out of no where and asked me if I knew where Katie was. I didnt, so she stood around w/ me untill the bell rang. Halle walked to where she usually chills in the morning (same place where I do) and immediatly left. I think it was because Cortney was there and they hate each other. Every time I give Cortney a hug I get bitched at by Halle...and the same way with Cortney. But im sick and fucking tired of all the bitching im getting. Its getting really fucking annoying. Well...I believe a change of subject is in order. NEXT PARAGRAPH!

Yea...I turned in my books today at the last minute (as usual) and I found out I lost my World History book. Well thats 50 bucks out of my pocket. I dont care though.

"event","Damn...long time no update! Well I didnt feel like updating so get over it! Man im so fucking pissed right now. Its really a long story...so im going to tell it to you. It starts with Cortney, the love of my life you might say! Yes I still loved her when I was going out w/ Rachel. Although i do hate to admit it but i thought about Cortney all the time even when i was with Rachel. Iv liked Cortney since last fucking year and the only thing from me from asking her out was her boyfriends and her continues talk of how hot some guy is or how bad she wants to fuck some guy. *Shrugs* shit happens ya know? I was on the verge of asking her out then...hell broke loose. She came up to me raving about her new boyfriend Matt. Damn i hate that fuck hole. He was cool at first then he started to think me and Cortney were fucking behind his back, but thats besides the point. Well i waited day by day waiting for the day to come when they broke up. Well that day came this year not too long ago, about 2 weeks ago. But...it wasnt in my favor as i hopped it would be. When her and Matt were still going out her and this other guy Kip were making out right infront of me over...and over...and over again. Well i got fucking fed up with that bull shit so i said ""fuck this shit"" and stopped going upstairs and lately i have been an ass to Cortney, but i dont give a shit. All the shit she put me through shes lucky i dont bitch her out every time i see her georgeous face! GOD DAMNIT! I hate it when she does that to me! Gets me fucking pissed off then she does that thing with her face...i cant really explain it. Its when she has no expression on her face, it almost looks like shes frowning. I dont really know what to make of it but fuck it. Im on the verge of just not giving a shit anymore.

Well anyway...i have no more mailbox. Yep i was that pissed today. Me and Garett went to Sara's work and her house so we could ask her where the hell the Magic Couldron was. She wasnt at either of those places so i called up Cortney and asked if we could chill w/ her for a couple of minutes. She said sure so we went on over there and she said she knew where it was so we all got into garetts car and drove off. Half way down her street guess what she said! ""LETS GO PICK UP KIP!"" i replied ""how about not?"" but...it was too late. Garett turned the corner towards Kip's house and that was the point of no return. So we picked him up and they started making out in the back seat (geez where HAVNT they made out?!) and that got me pretty pissed. Even though Kip and Cortney bother know i practically love her...they still made out. Well once Cortney got out of the car when we dropped her off i hit garetts dashboard...again. Garett was really cool about it and said ""Damn...I really need to remember that guys name. That or never put you three in the same room."" i kinda chuckled but i was still pissed. Garett is one of the best friends i have right now. Hes always there, although most of the stuff he says i have already realized lol. But its the thought that counts. Damn...that made me sounds REALLY gay. HAHA. Oh well...shit happens. Well i will stop boring you with this fucked up shit. Lata.

"event","Hey, this is Davis here. I was recently grounded and decided to say ""fuck this shit"" and walked out of the house. Well...i shouldnt have done that but i dont regret it one bit. Well, my weekend is going to ultimatly suck balls. Im grounded on my 16th birthday and the only thing i ""get"" to go do is go to Conroe to see my grandparents...which i dont want to...wanna know why? Well heres the scoop. I FUCKING HATE THEM!!!!! But hey free minutes for my phone *smiles*. I broke up with my girlfreind Rachel last night, she started crying but I didnt regret it. I was sick of her fucking attitude. We went out for three months, the first two months she was bad ass, listened to all the ssme music i did and everything, but at the begging of this month she started wearing Abercrombie and Fitch and saying the word ""like!"" wayyyyy too often. Well in conclusion...FUCK THE WORLD.

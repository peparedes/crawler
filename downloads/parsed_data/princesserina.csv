"event","22 days til i leave this island, 29 days til i fly to france.  to FRANCE.  i'm going to france. what?

i'll be in france for nearly 300 days... well, i'll be in europe for that long... and it'll all pass by in the blink of an eye.  but for now, it's monstrous.  HUGE. i'm losing my noodle. losing noodle.

of course, the losing of the brain might be due to the 52 hours that i worked from friday til yesterday, and the 3 that i worked this morning. or perhaps it's partially due to the lack of sleep that results from working 12-13 hours out of 24.

i know. i hear the wha-ambulance pulling up around the corner... but my body's telling me that it needs rest.  so i have two days off, one of which i intend to spend with the one and only michelle ralph, as she flies into and out of my life so quickly and randomly...  the other, may consist of more errands (they never end) and chores. eeeeeep. so little time.

but don't worry all, i'll see your faces at some point in the next year and a half for sure.  afterall, i'll be heading back to MUN in a year and a bit with the rest of yas.

loves yer faces. don't forget it."

yis.

so anyway.  life's still sunshine-y. boys still happen to be pretty insignificant in the world on ern murp (which btw, i'm kinda getting used to...). also, i went for a walk last night and spam worms attacked me. it was terrifying.

AND one of the girls who i work with (one of the 2 who have more experience than me) just got offered a new job.  she starts on monday.  she has been working non-stop in the restaurant... so i suspect that i'll be working non-stop pretty soon.  i had my first ""big group"" experience today.  73 people in for soup and sandwiches.  two seperate kind of groups.  and the elderly group couldn't seem to remember what they ordered.

whoa. i was about to tell a really long story about soup and sandwiches... don't do that erin. don't be that waitress.

in other news. me and em went and saw ""a prairie home companion"" earlier this week.  and it was hilarious.  slightly bizarre, but worth a watch.

i'll leave you with my favorite* joke from the movie:  two penguins were standing on an ice flow. 1st penguin says to the other ""you look like you're wearing a tuxedo.""  2nd penguin replies ""how do you know i'm not?""




*favorite doesn't mean funniest.  although i did laugh pretty hard and long at it."

"event","school's out forever?  no... today, only for retired teachers and high school kids who won't go on to further their education.  

as for me, school's not really pertinent.  except that the restaurant where i work now (started ""training"" yesterday and made $40 in tips ~cha-ching~) will hopefully get busier... and by hopefully i mean, i'd like to have another shift or two to get my bearings before the place fills to capacity.  seems like a good crowd that i'm working with. i'm excited about the summer. working will be a good change. and if i does right good, i'll have a job guaranteed for next summer. whoot!

and about the rest of life?  well, leading up to my first day of work was an amazing stretch of fun-fulled days and nights.  including: jumping in puddles the size of ponds in my rubber boots, a trip to the beach - northern bay sands, salmonier nature park (we saw the meadow vole!), bbqed 'otdogs, board games, shopping, the hike around signal hill, long walks around downtown, and of course, laying out on my deck in the glorious sunshine.

life's alright ya know.  pretty fantastic all in all. i like it. i like it a lot. (and as papa john would say ""those who like it, like it a lot. -i think he was quoting a commercial... sounds about right. ""even the grapes?"")

so, big event tomorrow night at o'brien's. so i get to dress all in black. hurrah!"

i know that if i blink i'm going to be looking out my apartment window in Nice thinking that it's only 3 months before i come back again... so i'm gonna try hard not to blink for the next year or so, so as to gain ample enjoyment from the moments as they pass.

for the record, i haven't started work yet, and i don't know when i will.

brother has been gone for a week and a half, which means he comes back in half a week for a few weeks before he goes again for more than a few weeks. (sidenote: on Lingo the other day a couple tried to use ""W-H-E-E-K"" as a word. i'm not sure whether that was before or after the other couple spelled ""W-H-E-E-P"". but in either case my mom and i nearly peed in our pants.)

that's kinda how i feel about life being a rollercoaster right now. i feel like my stomach isn't strong enough to take it right now... or that my head might explode. 

i'm feeling critical, and moody beyond moody.  i don't even know where to begin to explain my moods. there are good things in my life right now. (ex. i have an interview with o'brien's on friday). but there are also things that make me go MARH (ex. boys who don't really care at all AND don't even pretend to.)

if i could send a telegram to him i would say: dear boy (stop) if you were to pretend that you cared i might want to see you (stop) as it is i would rather not (stop) ever again (stop) if you feel the need to see me again please bring flowers and stand outside my window with a 50 piece marching band (stop)  otherwise this is it (stop) thanks for nothin' (stop)

don't look ahead too far, and live life day by day. i guess the problem comes in when you take that quick glance towards the future. you see an impending end...  would you rather know that the end is just around the corner? or be caught by surprise?  (i'm not talking about death... that's too morbid for a wednesday morning). 

you finally find someone that makes you happy, and while you know that it won't last forever... not even for more than a few months, how do you stop yourself from getting in deeper than you intended?

just for fun. just for the moment. taking it day by day... or date by date. no expectations and very few wishes. because it will be easier to let go when it does happen to end.  

and then you realise how quickly a moment passes.

how do you live in a moment when before you realise it's happening, it's gone?"

it just pains me to think about the hatin' that went on.  i'm not a hater (as much as michelle ralph might argue that i WAS the hater near central park), and i don't enjoy hate. whether it's towards me, or my friends, or people i know, or people i don't even want to know. there's no need for it. at all. (maybe that's a little bit of my dad coming through)... either way. as much as the week was good, it was painful. and in everything i do, i only speak for myself. and in anything i say that might be misconstrued, i say it in order to get a reaction. not a negative one. but just a few seconds of thought from the receiving end. of course, the world is not a perfect place, and i was caught in conversations that i would have preferred not to have had to even be a part of, but then i thought it was over. i mean, we were on the ""losing end"" of things right?  

so i thought it was over. but as i walked back from putting my tray back i hear an ""in your face"". and really. what's in my face? the fact that barnes house won winter carnival again? boy, i didn't lose anything. except the last 15 minutes of peace... interrupted. 

but now that i've raged, i'm good to go. all that nonsense is over in my mind. if only my mind was clear of nonsense.
but alas. it is my mind and inherently and eternally full of nonsense. 

so enough with barnes house hating loder, martin, & burke house. eff off. get over it. grow some sense. all we are saying is give peace a chance. ;)"

i'm been surfing the interweb. looking at people's blogs etc., cause really, what else is there to do on friday evening?  

my answer will have to be: nothing.  because i need to relax, recupe, rejuve, unwind...  somehow the first two weeks back went downhill 3 days ago.  thinking back, i was having a deadly time.  smiling and dancing practically every step of the way.  of course it was all pretty much a dream. one of those dreams that you think is going to end so well, and then the plot twists and you wake up crying.

i am a very self-destructive person. especially when it comes to drinking* & boys. generally, i can handle drinking sans boys.  now, boys alone... i will not claim to have any control in this area.  because quite frankly, i don't.  my master plan A at the moment is to get a transfer to blackall and lock myself in my room except to eat, do bathroom type activities, and go to class. now, i already forsee a few problems with this plan. 1. i don't like girls. 2. i won't become any better with interacting with boys if i'm never around them. 3. i don't like blackall.

so there must be a plan B somewhere. yes. a less drastic plan in which i suck it up, and realise that it could be worse... i could actually live in blackall. B-B-B-L-A A-A-A-C-K A-A-A-L-L AAAAAY BLACKALL! 

barf.  and now. to commence relaxation.

i woke up at 6:30 this morning, feeling like i should be getting out of bed.  which makes sense because i had been sleeping since 9ish.

craig told me a funny story about how i wanted him to take my glasses and put then in random places, and then get them for me again.  the retrieving part makes sense because i wouldn't have been able to find them in a sober state, let alone the state i found myself in last night.

"event","when one is drunk, and in a big crowd, every second of every minute is utilised.  mostly used to say random things to random people. and then you spend hours (the next time you find yourself sober) trying to figure out if you really said all of those things. cause really, what would have possessed you to say half of that?

one answer comes to mind: alcohol.

some argue that alcohol is a truth serum.  but i'm not really sure that's true.  it definitely draws out some of your deepest thoughts, but i would like to point out the ridiculous number of your thoughts that carry no aspect of truth at all. often the things that rattle around in your cerebral area don't even pertain to your personal opinions. you give them no value, except that they're in existance... and that's about it.

if a person drinks and gets drunk at all, in their lifetime, they must understand that people cannot possibly apologise for every thing that comes out of their mouths.

perhaps i'll just throw out a big ""sorry i drink and get drunk"" out there into the universe... and an ""i forgive everyone else who does too"".

you may all quietly return to what you were doing. me and my bum are going to hang out for awhile.  maybe indefinitely... 

and if you want to stick around for a few more lines, my bum and i will explain to those of you who may be confused what the big deal is about.  well you see, i've been accused of not having a bum for many years. and in fact the one that i grew is probably smaller than most bums out there. BUT. (hehe) when i put on my pants now, they go ""ooh my, little tougher getting up around there.""  and i'm not complaining of not fitting in my clothing, cause that's something that i keep for my private affairs- not this online open to the world nonsense- i'm just letting you know that i do indeed have more of a bum than yesterseason.

i think i might just have to laugh at that for a few weeks now. 

i've been helping aunt x2 and mom with the cleaning out of nan's house. it's been decent, but the dust has my sinuses screaming for clean air.

in search of such air, i went for a walk to ""my"" beach this afternoon. and there's really nothing like a walk on a familiar beach to bring back buried memories. memories of winter, spring, summer, and fall. remembering mine and amy's promise that we'd climb the rock face (that looks much less steep now than back then), memories of canoeing with dad and ryan, thinking about the week before i went off to pearson when i'd slip down to the beach at night and think about how huge the universe was (and how relatively insignificant i was), going to see the tin man, and of just last summer when i took alex and amanda to see the place that was my home.  and then i looked up at the house that i lived in for 17 years. and do you know what they did?!  they put a roof over the patio! how am i supposed to sun bathe there?  

i know. i quickly realised that it wasn't my house anymore. i didn't look up and see dad on the patio checking to see that i didn't throw myself into the ocean as i was skipping rocks. there was no brady, no tara outside barking. and life goes on. places change ever so slightly while we're looking in the opposite direction. 

you'll all be happy to hear that the window that i broke when playing catch with my brother 15 or so years ago is still there... i had bad aim when i got spitey. okay. i had bad aim all the time, and when i was spitey i threw things hard enough to break the basement window. oops.

empress is a term used for any girl who seems to uphold or lean towards upholding a part of the rastafarian faith.  and since i have dreads, i'm one of them.

so we went to the national gallery.  and on the way up the street to the gallery a guy started calling out ""whitey...""(which may have been because i was wearing a white shirt... cause angela is also white ya know), ""empress!"" and other things that i couldn't quite understand.  but i knew he was talking to me, so i just kinda looked and nodded and ducked into the national gallery (which is the art gallery).  guess what?  he followed us in.  he was so taken by me that he, for the first time in his many years working construction downtown right near the gallery, he paid the next to nothing admission fee and came into the museum.  and although he was a seemingly very nice guy, i didn't understand much that he said.  so he conversed with jo... telling her that i was beautiful, and natural and all kinds of nonsense like that.  and he was heart broken that he couldn't talk to me.  i'm sure i might have tried talking to him if i thought i'd be saying much more than: ""what?! ...come again? ...huh?""  so i've cultured one rasta man today.  what shall i do tomorrow?

we might be going out, painting the town red, tonight.  but it's been raining, so there's only one club that's inside that we'd be going to.  can you imagine? all the hot clubs are outdoor venues.  WTF? never would work in newfoundland eh?

"event","so apparently [straight]boys are not only capable of dancing-  but enjoy dancing, and do it willingly all by themselves.  sometimes groups of boys.  with girls looking on.  uh huh.  it happens. it's not just something from that the popular media made up.  who woulda thunk it? (and for the record... it's hot.)

jo's yard has enough bearing fruit trees to be considered a farm.  granted i think the magic number is somewhere around 10.  but just think about it... that's a helluvalot of fruit. mmmm.  fruit.

and my feet are disgusting.  covered in mosquito bites. and maybe ant bites too. we're not sure.  but they tell me that i must be allergic to them. i'm hoping that they're allergic to me too... and suffering. hard.

planning on getting some more hardcore color.  mmm.  color. (the magic color being brown).

i'm sticky, and happy.  and if my feet weren't so itchy at night i'd be incredibly rested right now,  for now i'm just rested. :)

oh!  i went to the bob marley museum on hope road today.  amazing. well.  amazing for me.  right?  :) i was happy.  and i saw where he slept, and recorded music, and chilled out... and played football (which for you north americans is soccer).

alright enough for now."

"event","i have arrived.

(right now i have to go poo, but jo's in the bathroom)

it's raining au moment.  and it's sticky and warm, and for the record: i love it.

went to a party last night.  twas un peu bizarre, but, well, i'm in a different country and culture shock is something that goes with unless you go and plunk yourself down on a resort away from culture... 

my friend's family is awesome.  she told me that we must be a hit cause her mom was making breakfast.  

there are little ants everywhere, and lizards that climb over the walls.  and there was a frickin' huge moth in my (jo's) room last night. (for those of you who don't know, i'm afraid of moths.  and dead insects.)  so i said to angela ""i'm going to close my eyes and pretend that it's a cow being electrocuted.""  we laughed for a long time.  and i'm still not sure where that thought came from. and guess what?!  there's little lizards.  and they climb over the walls and ceiling. it's wicked!

food's good.  although i'm on an island, and island people like seafood.  i shall survive if only on fruit alone. :)

the rain's let up. i guess we're pool party bound.

love to you all."

"event","everywhere.  it's grey and cold outside. and spring's not quite here, and we're not together.

my brother and i have had an excellent visit together consisting of television, fudge, and ...that's all i remember.

so jamaica awaits me. 10 glorious days in the sunshine (and apparently thunder showers says TheWN), time to relax and groove to some reggae music whenever possible.

my travelling companion, angela, and i have decided to tell the nice people at air canada that we want to be seated together, but we both want window seats.  hehe.  decided to be difficult and amusing.  good plan eh?  

saralynn keeps calling me a bitchface. i'm going to assume that it's a term of endearment, like all my ""bitch, slut, whore"" remarks.  so thanks sl. i love you too.

so to toronto to stay with my cousin donna et famille, i go.  should be fun.  i enjoy seeing her kids, and her.  she's got amazing amounts of life. one of my favorite relatives i think.


if i don't update for awhile it means i'm way too busy having a load of laughs... and if i do update, it means that i have an addiction to communication.  i'll have to sort that out at some point in the future."

"event","a university town at its best.  really pretty for those of you who haven't seen it... and well, really empty after winter semester's done.   so here i sit in the library, using up some precious mount allison computer time...

i saw my murphy relatives monday and yesterday.  they came down for brother's convocation. really good to see them. ryan's currently in PEI, he's coming back to sackville today. are we ready for some intense brother/sister quality time?  maybe...

the appartment i'm staying in has TBS and a dvd player. so i'm set.  i watched wimbledon and some other dumb movie last night. and american idol and amazing race.  i'm such a junkie. i wouldn't watch tv if it weren't there... and it wouldn't bother me.  but since it is there, there i am.

nobody's online this morning.  (i'm not surprised)  but c'mon, the library isn't open at midnight... or past 4:30pm for that matter.

so... jamaica in 2!  whoop whoop.  good morning sunshine.  here comes the sun. sunshine lollipops and... oh mister sun, sun, mister golden sun.

oh, and fancy.  (look there you are!)  i don't remember the site of your blog.  it would be oh so much easier if you had a livejournal i figure. ;)  hehe

alright. this is murphy... saying i miss my friends today, and i'll miss them tomorrow, but on friday... it's all over and the sunshine will take away all my worries.  and you can miss me! and be jealous of me.  and that's cool right?  YIS ya KNOWS!

okay.  murphy, out."

"event","my aunt marnie was talking about how life wasn't fair...  she said that we should all have a check out date. that we should know when our time was going to be up.  (right away i was filled with a silent horror, imagine the days leading up to it... i guess they could be fantastic, but what if you're all alone leading up to the expiration date  and you KNOW...)

then aunt lois piped up and said that maybe if it was: no one could die before they're 65, but if you take care of yourself you can live longer.  their dad died when he was 58, mine when he was 48, nan was almost 77. we're all still dealing with the injustice that was our fathers' deaths. 

but then aunt lois was musing some more.  she said that there are definitely worse things in life than death.  and i completely agree. watching someone suffer brings the will for it to be over. and i didn't believe that that was possible.  that you would want someone to die...  until i saw it for myself. my dad was suffering. i secretly hoped that it would be over before too long.  and i felt guilty.  but i understand more now. life is sometimes over-rated if you can't LIVE.

the holes that are left in your heart, in your being, by those who go on before you... they can sometimes be filled in part by those who are yet to enter your life. (at least that's what i'm banking on)... but even if they go unfilled - i'm so much more whole because of my family, living and dead.

i don't believe that life is fair, and i'm not sure what the whole idea is, but i suspect that it doesn't much matter.  cause ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on..."

"event","it's funny, i probably wouldn't tell anyone if i didn't have this method of communication.

my nan (mom's mom) died this morning.

we're all keeping busy. i'm not sure i really realise that she's gone. she made me a cake for my birthday less than a week ago.  so it wasn't really an expected thing... although, she wasn't a well woman, she lived at home alone and i'm pretty sure she went shopping in clarenville yesterday.

she told me on sunday that she hoped she would be well enough to bake me a cake for my next birthday...

and there's nothing left to say right now.

oh. except that i'll be going to sackville on monday instead of sunday (when i'll be attending the funeral).

"event","so i woke up at like 5am this morning. feeling yucky.

i've kinda gotten over that.... just got off the phone with my darling angela (from cornerbrook who's going to jamaica with me in *GASP* 11 days) and am uber happy about sunshine. mmmmm sunshine.

BUT! bad news bears! i might not be driving to the states! *gasp* *choke* *cough* *wheeze*

the schtupid insurance company wish not to insure someone (namely me) who goes to the states for work purposes. granted, if i was going on an extended roadtrip all around the states, cool, badabing! i'm insured.  but instead.  badadoom... i'm working for two months down there, parking the car... and no insurance pour moi.  as of right now anyway.  (sigh) such disappointment in the air.

off to see the lawyer about money and house things. 
lovely day...  i'm out."

"event","that i could pretend that i'm posting at any point in time.  i could just change the date and mess everything up.  that would be fun wouldn't it?  *slash/pointless.

so. sing me a song and make the sunshine brighter.  where is the sun? it's grey today. and my living room is occupied by a sleeping o'brien.  so brother bear and i are locked up in mama's room with the computer and the cosby show (at the moment)... good times wha?  i mean, it's almost 2:00, and there's no sign of life down there. bizarre.

i should go for a walk or something. i have to take porkchops out for supper.  ryan and i don't eat porkchops. but i guess these things matter less and less with the increasing O's in the house...

doo dee doo. later days."

"event","the beginning of the end...  or something like that.

i'm home in lethbridge now. with paul-o and mama and ryan... and paul's eldest son mark was here, but left to see his friends a little while ago.  oh, and the dogs are here too.

mom and ryan are putting together a new bbq. i remember the first bbq my mom put together... she said something like ""who needs a man?!"" once it was done.  i think she had to try three or four times to get it right, but she did it.  (i was proud of her).

my room is chaulked full of my stuff, and mom's stuff and some of ryan's stuff.  i'm not quite sure how my room ended up being a storage room, but it is.  mom informed me today that my room is going to be gutted while i'm gone this summer, so i might as well do it myself and make my own decisions on what to keep.  so i've already started sorting through things.  i'm a packrat, and i come by it honestly...

anyway. it's time to get off my arse and do something. maybe make some phonecalls to long-lost friends... or something.

all for now folks..."

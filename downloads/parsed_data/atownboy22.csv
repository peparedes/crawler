"event","had a good weekend with roger! i have been looking forward to a weekend like this for so long. roger spent the night sunday during the day we hung out with steve and mari. on monday roger and i went to gay day at great america and my met my friend kenyatta her gf and her friends. we all had a blast except for i got impression from her gf that i was going to hit on kenyatta which wasn't going to happen.  maybe back in high school thats a different story but now naw it ain't going to happen. anyway who back to great america we got on the superman ride first that was totally awesome, then we went on the whizzer and oh my god the most shocking thing happened. i met one of janet jackson's dancers there! i was like a big ole dork lol i wish i would have gotten a picture with him he's a fine motherfucker...but yeah umm anyway after the whizzer went to the water park, then roger and i broke off and did our own thing together we both figured we could use some alone time. roger and i got on the viper and then we went on the batman ride so many times it wasn't even funny! one of those times it rained for two minutes then it stopped then after we got off the ride it stopped. after a few hours of being on our own we met up with the pack again and went on the raging cajun. oh my god talk about whiplash there lol. we went on a couple of water rides and lets just say on the boat ride i'm glad the damn boat didn't sink because there was a hole in the fucking boat. and people passing us kept telling us there was a hole in the boat like we didn't freaking know that lol! after that we went on the rapids ride where i got completely soaked from head to toe. roger and i left before the park closed we were both tired and very hungry all we got there was a lemonade because that shit was so freaking expensive there. we came back to my house and got pizza and we watched tv and made out and then i took him home i was sad that the day had to end because this is the most fun we have had with each other....well i'm pretty sure there are other moments but they just won't be mentioned.  yeah on tuesday went to work and found out i won't have a job anymore. so i'm out a job right now and very pissed because i really liked the job. all i'm going to say is for the reason why no longer work at the school is because i'm not enrolled in any summer classes and i would have to take summer classes to be work at the school and since i'm not then i'm not allowed to work at the school and my manager basically laughed in my face when i told her that i couldn't find a class and she just laughed and said well i guess you are unemployed and then said thanks for letting me know and hung up the phone! i wish i knew what car she drove so i could key her shit! i haven't even told my parents yet the first person i told was roger since he is the bf well lets see i had to talk to him and calm him down a little bit since he was upset and its bad enough i was already pissed but i don't want him being upset so i just put my feelings on hold which was ok with me. so basically now i have to go job hunting and i damn sure don't want to go back to meijer because i hated that job so much! i would rather kill myself or drive my car through a building in hopes of killing myself then go back to meijer. but yeah anyway thats pretty much how my weekend went. it started out good and then goes to shit. i'm very thankful that i had a good weekend before i got this bad news otherwise this would have soured my weekend.

here are some pics at gay day from great america that we took

"event","this is a long awaited update in the making! i haven't updated this journal in a month. nothing much has been going on lately just chilling hanging out with my teddy bear roger! lately i have been up and down emotionally for some reason. i haven't been giving anything my all really except for my relationship to me thats my first prioity over anybody else lately. i been kinda been putting people on the back burner which is not a good thing of course but my man is out of school and i get to see him more than i have ever dreamed of so if that means not hanging out with people and kinda giving them the backseat then so be it.... as shitty as that sounds. i know it ain't right but hey i want things to go smoothly. i really looking forward to this weekend and monday. i get to spend time with my man and he's spending the night sunday night....so umm yeah thats always fun. on monday roger, my friend kenyatta and her girlfriend and friends, and myself will be going to great america for gay day! which i think is totally awesome. yay for gay day this for my peoplez but anyway yeah thats all i got to say right just letting everyone on here know that i'm alive and sorta well. 

oh yeah before i go i figured i would add a pic of what roger looks like with a gotee now, the gotee really makes him look hot i think but i don't really care what other people think i've wasted enough of my time with what others think.

"event","i just saw the best movie ever!!!!!!!!! the house of wax was so awesome. i saw it with jovanny his boyfriend mike and our friend jenna. i have biology with jenna and jovanny. this is my second time meeting his boyfriend he's really cool guy and he's very funny. its nice that i can make everyone laugh and everything. but yeah the house of wax is good movie....now at first i thought it was going be kinda stupid but  i was wrong.  oh and when chad micheal murray takes off his shirt everyone in the theater went oh my god!!!!! i was like damn i want one those shit! and of course with every movie you always get two shows for the price of one yall know what i'm talking about when people are sitting behind you and they are talking. mike went off on those people like twice during the movie and i was thinking ummmm yeah ok there is like 2 to 3 bitches and like 3 to 4 guys in that group so i'm like please don't let anyone of them say something and shit get started i'm not really in a fighting mood tonight but it was ok no one said anything so it was all good. no one had to get beat down tonight. well my days this week have been good except for earlier today when this old guy i say about in his late 50's or maybe early 60's approached me today when i entered cod. i just got this vibe that he was a perv and besides he kept shaking my hand and he two inches away from my face so he was close enough to kiss me lets just say. but yeah i just felt kinda creeped out about that. i mean i have been hit on my older men before and you know its nice to be hit on but from someone in your age group though. i mean do i have a sign on my back that says ""all cripples and really old folks come talk to me"" he told me that he has see me before in the art center and that i seem like a person that has a big heart and alot of friends and that encourage people and that i will do good for my career in graphic arts. i didn't mind the compliments but you know its just when you get a weird vibe then you know somethings up. and he also said that he doesn't consider me a stranger but he considers me as his friend. the worst thing about this is i was telling my friend john at work and he was like i know what guy you are talking about he said the same thing to me too. he said he also got the vibe of him being a perv too. so yeah he teaches piano at cod so hopefully i won't see him or that he will never come to the copy center to get copies made. but yeah that was my day in a nut shell, tomorrow should be fun as well my friend mari wants to do a documentary on me for project for school. so yeah i get to be in front of the camera i hope i don't get camera shy hehe but anyway thats it for me."

"event","yeah just another crazy saturday again lol. well i haven't been to meijer in about 2 or 3 weeks. my mom keeps telling me that everyone keeps asking about me and asking her if i was going to come back and everything. but she just says she doesn't know anything, like a good mom is suppose too. i don't want them in my business and shit if they want me to come back then they know my number they can call it and if i was to come back they would have to come up off of some more money. i wouldn't be going back for a measly $7.80 i would want at least $8 even though i still would be making more at the bookstore but at least at meijer they do have one good point they pay every week. but still i like the book store a lot better anyway and plus i get off and i can still go out at a very reasonable time. right now i'm just sitting here chilling at my friend eddie's house. we are probably going to watch some movies and chit chat. i'll be spending the night here. i'm also really looking forward to next weekend when roger comes down. i know will have some fun and then i get smack him for not telling me something that he knows he should have. the lil tator head bitch ass hoe! lmao but anyway its been awhile since i updated this thing, i guess its due partial to the fact that i started a new job, and i have been going out a little bit more lately then i use too, and making new friends in and out of school so yeah things have been going good lately. but yeah i think im going to start updating my journal entry a little more it seems like i have been neglecting it as of late and everything. i may even change my layout too.....but then again i don't know i'm still kind of digging my layout. i dont know who knows but we'll see though. so how has everyone been doing on here? i haven't talked to some people in a very long time on here and i haven't really read any entries lately either. so i guess now would be a good time to start reading. i guess my high school did teach me something besides smoking in the school lol....they taught me how to read and write! ""i good at english"" that was for someone on here that likes to poke fun at my little typo i made a little while ago. that person knows who he or she is and i'm here to tell them that i'm coming to get them oh yeah baby full throttle with my cock out for them! they can lick my balls and suck on my motherfucking cock! lmao im just kidding they don't have too....if they don't want too!"

"event","yeah i went to a job interview yesterday  and i got a new job paying $13 bucks an hour....even though i'm excited i'm still don't want to leave meijer i guess maybe i'm a little scared i mean i will have been there almost a year in a few months. maybe its because my mom started working there this week and i really don't want to leave her there its like ok i got her hired and i said we would be working together now i'm all leaving and shit. but i still filled out my new availability form and everything for meijer so when i go and turn it in today hopefully i will be able to get on second shift so yeah. i still got my cold and everything but yeah hopefully i should be cleared up by sunday at least. well my spring break starts next week so i'm glad for that. i hope my roger had a fun time on his spring break this week and i hope he had fun spending time with is family i love you roger! yeah i have nothing really else to say for now so i'll probably add more later if i feel like."

"event","yeah i have been sick for the past few days and not getting any better. i have been having sever headaches, coughing up yummy stuff, stuffy nose, and i have cold chills. so yeah needless to say i haven't been feeling well. i started feeling really sick when i was leaving my friend shane's house on sunday. i just got cold all of a sudden and i'm like man i'm sick. i have had that feeling before so i know when my body is going to shut down. i haven't had any energy to do anything i am surprised as slow as i am walking i am making it to the bathroom. but anyway i just wanted to let everyone know who has called me within the last day or so that i'm sorry if i didn't pick up the phone but i'm sick and i get bitchy when i'm sick so i don't want anyone to think that i have just been ignoring them for no reason. i just don't like being sick. so yeah i'll talk to everyone probably this weekend or something."

"event","it has come to my attention that i need to make some changes around certain people. i don't want to but i think that its whats going to have to happen. first off i'm going to stop blaming myself all the tine when things happen. its not always my fault and i should have to be kicking myself down for something that i didn't do. second off i'm going to start expressing my feelings and my opinions more. so if anyone doesn't like what i have to say then that's too bad i always listen to what over people have to say and their opinions whether they were fucked up or not i still listened. so now its my turn to say what it is i have to say now. i have a right to express my opinions no matter whether you like it or not its my god given right to say whatever the hell i want to say. so yeah im going to stop beating myself, and i'm not going to let anyone talk to me no any kind of way either. that bullshit stops today! so yeah there's a new matt in town who will be speaking up for himself more and if anyone has a problem with it well tough!!!!!! go cry me a fucking river! there's a million people in this world that don't know me or like another won't hurt. so yeah thats all i have to fucking say for the fucking moment."

"event","i had a very good weekend with roger. he spent the weekend at my house with my family and me. well just me really anyway lol. my parents like him, and my mom actually gave him a hug so i thinking that she is coming around to us dating and everything which is good so i won't have to be stressed out as much. i was late kinda picking up roger, but i had to go to the store before i picked him up friday night. you know how you want things to be perfect and everything. well i kinda disappointed him for being late but he understood and i made it up to him later on. so friday i picked him up and we came back to my house. he loved my room, i know he did because he was all up in my shit. looking through things but its ok he's the boyfriend he's allowed too. my mom ordered pizza for us. we went with my mom to go get it. but first we went to the post office because my mom had to drop off a stack of letters. then went to meijer i couldn't even get my foot in the door without someone talking to me. one of my friends was pushing two heavy carts and he's like hey matt whats up man can you help me with one of these carts. of course me being the person that i am i helped him, so as i was walking away talking to my friend and everything. i was thinking oh shit i hope roger doesn't think something is going on. after i helped him my friend gave me a hug. and i was thinking the whole entire time like why is he hugging me a simple thanks matt would have just done fine. i felt like the scum of the earth. after spending about an hour in the store. we left to go get the pizza then we came back home. we brought the groceries in and then we made a trip to blockbuster we rented jason goes to hell and the miner massacre. i like the miner massacre then i did jason goes to hell. when came back to my house i explained to roger that the guy i was talking to was a friend at work and he asked me to help him. we ate pizza as we watched movies. we didn't go to sleep to about 3:30 in the morning. we slept in my room in my bed. of course my parents are like keep your door cracked. well i didn't because i never sleep with my door open but i met them half way and kept my door unlocked. well saturday we didn't go anyway we just stayed at home and watched taxi and saw (both of which are good movies by the way). my parents and my brother went to the movies so we got the whole house to ourselves where we were running from each other and closing doors, playing hide and seek. it was fun i really enjoyed myself. later on about 10:30 or 11:00 steve and mari came over and we watched tv and had left over pizza. mari left a lil early so i told her i would take steve home. mari and aaron were going to see the blue man group the next day. almost about 2am roger and i dropped steve off at home and then we came back to finish watching saw. oh my god i got so scared when the guy saw's off his foot i was grabbing roger and hiding behind him. i mean some stuff i can handle but i mean sawing off your own foot without any knock out shit i can't do it. shit i would have rather sat in that room and just got another family lol. naw im kidding if it was me i would do the same. sunday roger got up before me and he got on the internet, i know because i kinda woke up for a sec then i went back to lala land. well the next thing i know i feel cold water on me and of course i jump up to see roger standing over me laughing. well i signed to him you bitch and i started laughing. well i kinda laid back down but roger went downstairs to have breakfast. i got up finally and we started working on the pictures i took from his b-day and this weekend. after i had the photos being printed out we went to the mall. we went to Spencer's and then we went to Hot Topic. roger got a marilyn manson tshirt and a black shirt with white stripes, and a bracelet. he also bought me a bracelet too which i truly love. i'm going back to get me another one i saw some others that looked totally cool. well after the mall we had to come back to get his stuff and the pictures because he had to go back to niu before his meeting at his job at 7pm. we expressed how much we loved each other and how much we would miss one another. but i get to spend the night up there this saturday so there was no crying down this time....although i took some tissue with me just in case. but roger made me promise that i wouldn't cry and i agreed. after i dropped roger and we said our goodbyes, i hung out with steve at his house for a little bit then i went to meijer to get some more hair gel since i was out and then i went home. i dreaded going back home because i knew roger wasn't going to be there with me. my room just felt so empty. its like ok i shared my room with my boyfriend for two days and now its like where the hell did he go. and falling asleep was the worst because i remember turning over to face the wall and i opened my eyes i kinda expected him to be there but there was no one there. it almost brought a tear to my eye but i made a promise so i just went back to sleep. i think i had a pretty good weekend, and i would never thought my parents would let my boyfriend even sleep in the same bed you know since we are not married and everything. my parents are the old fashion type that don't believe in premarital sex, but we have to live our own lives and make our own decisions my decision is to be with roger and to spend the rest of my life with him, and if anyone doesn't like oh well tough, i mean hell theres a million people in this world that don't know roger and i and don't like two guys dating each other...a few more won't hurt shit!  well i can see this journal is getting long so i'll end it now i hope everyone had a good weekend and i'm looking forward to this saturday to see my roger again."

You seduce people by tapping into their dreams and desires.
And because of this sensitivity, you can be the ideal lover for anyone you seek.
You are a shapeshifter - bringing romance, adventure, spirituality to relationships.
It all depends on who your with, and what their vision of a perfect relationship is.</font></td></tr></table>

"event","last night well i should say this morning was scariest point of my life. well the evening started off with me going to steve's house to hang out a bit. but i had not feeling good all day long, because i had the shakes and i was getting cold all of the time. well i left steve's house and i came back home i talked to roger for a little bit and i got the shakes again as i was leaving and my mom wanted me to stay home, and told her that she sounds just like steve. but i figured hey my dad went to work when he was sick before he got MS so i figured hey i can go to work too and suck it up. well when i got to work i just started feeling worse and worse. i had to sit down at one point because it felt like my left lung and my kidney was hurting. at one point i must have moved my body a certain way that it felt like someone was stabbing me all over my back. at that point i lost it and started crying. i asked lily to take me to the hospital because i wasn't feeling well. before we left i tried calling my brother but he didn't answer so i called my mom and i scared her because i was crying on the phone. well lily took me to rush copley emergency they did the normal tests and everything. then gave me a room, then they made me take a urine test. then i had to go back to my room. a doctor came and told me that there some blood in my urine and then he went over what was wrong and told him i had very bad back pain. then said i may have kidney stones. which scared the shit out of me because i didn't know what kidney stones were. so he told me that he was going to get a nurse and she was going to take me to get a cat scan on my body. well the nurse came and got me the cat scan lasted about 5mins then i went back to my room where i sat there all by myself for 30 mins. my mom would have been there sooner but they she was trying to wait until my brother went home so he could stay with my dad. she finally got him as she was leaving the house and she told him to stay with our dad. mom gets there and i was kinda thinking damn even for and emergency my mom made sure her stuff was on point. lily came in with her and they asked what did the doctor say and told them what the doctor said. well we all kinda just that wasn't what we were expecting to hear. after sitting and talking for another 20 mins the doctor came back in and said the test results were fine and there wasn't any blood in my urine and i definitely don't have kidney stones. i just hurt one my back muscles really badly. he asked did i lift upon anything heavy and told him my dad fell out of the bed last and i picked him up. well that must injured something in my back. so i'll probably have to go to physical therapy now. i can't go to work tonight and i'm still coughing so i think i have bronchitis on top of my injured back. they prescribed to medicines for me one that makes me drowsy which they gave me one before i left. which is why didn't wake up until almost 6pm today. so my mom is taking me to work so i can give them my note the doctor wrote and then i have a doctor's appointment tomorrow at 9:15am so yeah i still think the medicine is still in my system so i think i might go lay back down i'll talk to everyone later bye."

"event","yesterday was a very slow day. i was bored most of the day and i didn't have the energy to do anything. i talked to steve for a little bit today. i went to work last night i just got off an hour ago. tonight at work wasn't a very good night for me at all. i don't know why but i cried most of the night at work. i really didn't care i just let the tears flow, people that i was ringing at were just like looking at me like you poor thing. but i guess i'm really not sad but i'm happy. i think what still shocks me was that roger was crying because he was going to miss me and that he loves me. i just never had someone cry about missing me or loving me its just all new to me and it feels so good, but i feel the same way as roger does. i have never cried because i was going to miss someone until tuesday night. i just felt a very strong connection between us that was filled with love. its just a whole new world we both were able to share with one another and i like it alot!!!!!!!!! its so cool and sweet to cry for the one you love, and i fall deeper in love with roger everyday. there is just something about him that is just so irresistible. he always surprises me with something new whenever we see each other. its going to be hard not being able to see him until next weekend because every time i think about him i cry. but i think i will be ok though. its getting kinda late so i'll update later on bye."

"event","Yesterday was very exciting it was Roger's birthday. Steve and I took Roger out to dinner for his birthday at Steak n' Shake in De Kalb. We had a blast, even though I thought some of his friends were going to go but none of them did because Roger said that they were busy. But he didn't care as long as me and steve were there for him. We spent about an hour and half there. We took pictures while we were there. After dinner we went back to the dorm to have cake. Which jewel messed up on because I ordered chocolate cake and instead received yellow cake that ticked me off but oh well. We had cake with his roommate and his friends. They are all so totally awesome. There really nice down to earth people that like to joke around like I do. I know Roger told that he wished his family was here with him, but I told him that I, Steve, and his friends step in and be his family for tonight. The hardest thing was saying our goodbyes because we had so much fun. I know when I was putting on my coat I gave Roger a hug and told him I would talk to him Thursday on the internet. After we released each other from the hug I realized that his eyes were watery, so I asked him was he crying and he said a little. All I could do was hug him and kiss him. Because I started crying myself. Which is what I'm doing right now as I'm typing this out right now. I couldn't believe we were both crying. That just goes to show the strength of our love. I miss him so much right now. I wish he was here to hold me right now as I'm crying, and I wished I could have held him longer as he was crying. I just can't wait till next weekend because I asked him to spend the night at my house Friday night and Saturday night. I'm glad that we will have next weekend to be with each other. I just know that I would drop school and anything else to be with Roger. I am so grateful to have him in my life and in my heart! My love has no limit and after we both cried I absolutely without a doubt know that I want to marry Roger and that I want to move in with him. The only thing that is helping me right now is my stuffed tiger Roger got me for valentine's day. Holding it makes feel like Roger is in arms. I know Roger and I tell this to each other a lot but I love him so very much and I miss him so much right now. I'm gonna go wipe my eyes and then I'm going to bed everyone take care everyone. I fucking love each and everyone of you all!!!!!!!"

"event","the past few days i have been really excited about this weekend. i hope this weekend goes perfectly like roger and i planned it to be. this weekend is going to be the most romantic weekend we have ever had. thats all i can think about really, and expect that i got an unexpected raise at work! whoo hoo for that shit a mofo has been needing a pay increase. but anyway back to this weekend. the plan is on friday i make the reservations for the hotel room in aurora. on saturday after school, i pack some clothes and go to hotel and get checked and have the room all set up and everything. then i leave to go pick up roger. we come back to the hotel to change into our casual romantic clothes. we go get some grub, maybe go to a movie afterwords or something else, then come back to the hotel and fill the bathtub with bubbles and rose petals, you know the romantic stuff and yeah......anyway so yeah thats the plan, and on sunday after we check out i don't what we'll do we'll probably chill or do something until i drop him back off at niu later on that evening. but then i get to see him again on tuesday since its his birthday. yay for roger turning 20! i don't even know what to get him for his birthday yet. i'm pretty sure something will come to me before his birthday. i can't even begin to explain the love we share for each other. he is the first thing i think about when i wake up and when i got to sleep. our love goes beyond the physical, our love goes to the emotional and mental level as well. we can sense what the other is thinking without even asking. i have longed for that kind of love for so long. we both feel its a shame that we didn't meet before instead of going through what we both have endured but we look at it like this, we had to go through the bad to get to the good. we both are the good and we will remain that way till the day we die. i just want to let him know that when we get married heaven forbid that something should happen to me that i want him to know that its ok for him to love again. he would have my blessings on that, and i'm pretty sure he feels the same way as i do. granted that attachment to each other will still remain but i can honestly say i can't see myself with anyone else in this world. we are going on 4 months of dating and they have been the best 4 months of my life. nothing can compare the happiness i have when i am with him. just being around him and how positive his energy is....its just uncanny nothing i have encountered has been able to match that energy. he has shown me different levels of love that i thought i would never be able to have with someone. the one thing i like about us is that we can be totally open and honest with each other and tell each other which one is doing something to the other they may not like and not even get upset about it. i think thats the key factor that has helped our relationship. the line of communication is always open between us. i just want to dedicate this journal to roger my boyfriend, my lover, my friend i will always love you my love for you will never change. i fall in love with more as each day passes. you mean the world to me and i would do anything for you. i love you and i will see you soon! its time for me to hit the hay i got somethings to do later on today before friday and saturday. i'll try to update later on today and tomorrow if not there will definitely be an update on sunday. everyone take care and hold everyone close to your heart."

"event","i'm pissed off to the extreme right now. i just got fucking sent home from work for no fucking reason at all right now. i know am absolutely positive i didn't do a damn thing. i just lay out the story for everyone. i got to work i didn't feel like to talking to anyone really due to an incident at work the other day i told steve about. but anyway i walked him people said hi and i did the polite thing and said hi back. well i clock in and took off my hoodie and my friend lillie walked over to me and asked me could i escort a lady to her car because she was by herself and that her friend got his car stolen yesterday in the tgi fridays parking lot. i escorted her out to her car and i came back inside took off my hoodie again and then i started working. i did the fucking t-racks. which means straighten all of the magazines in the front and putting stray magazines back where they belong. that normally takes about an hour to do, but i did the shit in the 20 mins because i was in my working mode. after that i cleaned the fountain drink counter wiping all of that nasty shit down. then i went out into the lobby and wiped down the ice cream and candy machines. after that i volunteered myself to go outside and get carts since i cart guy was off tonight. well i finished the lot in 2 and half hrs with only coming inside twice for 10 mins to warm up again. after i was done with the lot i clocked out for my 15 min break at 1:19 i came back at 1:35 after that i helped fill bags and everything. i went to go get even more bags from the back. i got done with all of that at 2am so i got a register and i started ringing people up. well my friend lillie who is the manager at guest service after a guest and was like hey whats up matt. i said nothing much; and then she asks me whats wrong? i replied with nothing i just don't feel like talking really. well she said oh ok thats a good reason. then she walked away for about 10 mins, i rang up my last guest after that, then she comes back and tells me matt shut your light off and you can go home. i asked her why? what did i do? she said there's nothing to do and we are not busy. and i just stood there looking dumb as hell and all i could say was ok. as i'm walking to clock out i was fuming like a mofo! the only thing i could think was what the hell did i do and why am i the only one being sent home while everyone else gets to stay. i guess maybe they sensed that something was wrong with me and they thought it might be best if i went home, but i think they went about it the wrong way and that pisses me off. yeah there was something wrong with me the other night, its about the incident that i mentioned earlier that i'm not going to get into. i just feel like the work i did was unappreciated, just because i went outside the group today and i didn't stand around and didn't gossip or talk about anyone. well i'm sorry but i'm not one of your typical norms. if i think about since i started working there that place has brought out the worse in me. since august of last year when i started there thats what we basically did on the night shift, just straight talk about people, tell people who did who where they did it just all that type of bullshit. well i'm here to say yes i have said my fair share of shit about folks but you know it takes a real person to realize that they are too old for that bullshit. i'm to old for that shit i had the suit and i wore it! its old and its tired, i have better things and someone special in my life right now that i need to focus on. so i guess i went outside the meijer circle and i paid for it by losing a hour and half of pay just because i did what i was paid to do and thats doing my job! of course when i got home my parents are like what are you doing home so early. i told them what happened and they were just like you know whatever. my parents are hoping that i find another job. that place will fucking drive you insane, so as advice to anyone thinking of applying at meijer don't waste your time filling out the application or the ink in the pen. its not worth it! i would rather be out on a street corner selling crack to people then work at that place. well anyway i'll feel better in the morning anyway i do feel a lil better since i got a chance to vent out my frustrations well anyway i'm gonna get some rest cause i'm gonna go job hunting today. well everyone take care and be safe peace."

"event","i got a phone call from steve this morning asking to get the number for a hospital his dad was at because he pasted out at work. of course he was upset so i had to tell him to calm down because you can't think clearly when you are upset. i have to agree with the lady that called to let him know his dad pasted was completely dumb. who and the hell would call someone and tell them your father pasted out at work but don't be alarmed. im mean.....i don't even know what to say to that one. my thoughts will be with you steve i hope your dad will get better. if that wasn't bad enough news i just got thru talking with one of my friends that i haven't seen in awhile it was in a horrible car accident yesterday. man i don't know whats going on in the world these days. i just hope everything calms down around here. well i got a chance to talk to to roger today since i didn't yesterday because i had to go to work. he told me the funniest thing that his friend felicia wants to see us make out and have sex and she also wants us to do a threesome too. roger and i agreed that wouldn't mind making out in front of her but having sex or a threesome ummmmm....thats stretching it just a bit lol. only we are allowed to see each other naked no one else. lol that just makes me appreciate my body that someone else wants to see me naked. well anyway just a update before i go to work unfortunately i'll holla at everyone later."

"event","this past weekend was good. i got to spend the night in dekalb with roger. when i got there at first things were kinda awkward because lot of his friends were in the room and a couple of them were staring at me, which kinda made me feel a lil self-conscious but i got over it after we went bowling and everything. we had a blast bowling, i kick everyone's but as usual. i gonna have to teach roger how to properly throw the ball down the lane because the way he was throwing it it was like he was throwing the ball on the ground making a loud ass noise and shit, i will admit one of the times he did throw it down there he got a strike. so i have to give him his props for that. but me on the other hand i couldn't' get a strike to save my life. lol oh well we each have our days where we suck at something. but bowling my thing i guess i just had to get use to the lanes there. we really didn't get that much sleep because i think how we were laying in the bed. roger claims that my snoring kept him up, and told him that his snoring kept me up. then he claims that he doesn't' snore and that he is a quite sleeper, i had to break it to him that he's not a quite sleeper and plus he was laying his head on my chest so he was kinda snoring in my face, while as for me on the other had i was snoring over his head. but besides that we both had a really good time and we decided we would do it again this Saturday. so i excited because this past Monday i had my first sign language class at school and i learned about 40 signs which i am really excited about. its not as hard i thought it would be. roger is really impressed that i learned those many signs already and i just can't wait to show him what i have learned so far. i also told him i want to thank him for loving me unconditionally loving me 4 me, and i told him i loved him the same way. i can honestly say that we both will be together until the end of time. like all the negativity is just going roll off of us and just give us the more fuel we need to keep us together. unfortunately i have to go to work tonight so im gonna get in the shower and everything because im going over to steve's house before i got to work, and hang out like we use too. before the jobs got in the way. peace out people and take care, and remember your true love is just around the corner."

"event","things have been going good around here. im leaving 3rd shift at meijer on tues - fri and i will be going to first shift just working in the morning. 3rd shift is really became a pain in the ass. because i am more awake in the morning then i am at night. plus no one really comes into the store 3rd shift during the weak to generate any real business, so i am still surprised the store is still open 24hrs. when the store first opened people were in the constantly but not that management has changed so many times and the quality of the store has gone done the store is like a dump. that's why our store gets the most bad checks, high volume of theft (from guests and employees...but i think its more employees), and we the people with the stank attitudes. i had to switch to 1st shift for my health i'm not getting anything you could really say decent sleep. when i get off i am still up until 12 or 1 in the afternoon when i should be sleeping, but my body can't take anymore of just running off of fumes. i have to just face the fact that i am getting fucking old im 23 i can't do all the shit i use to do in high school. like staying up and only getting an hour sleep and getting right back up for school. can't do that anymore a mofo has to at least get 4 or 5 otherwise im not a person you want to be around. but yeah so i'll be glad that i will be switching over to mornings next week, i guess they will just have to find another lackey to go thru 8 carts of bullshit each night to put them in there correct departments. oh besides elise and i got a chance to hang out the other night we went to lsd. we ate and talked, she knitted a hat while we were talking and i was smoking and talking. so yeah that was a blast, i actually forgot how it felt to go out on a weekday night instead of strictly on the weekends. oh steve i hope you get better and your laryngitis goes away so we can hang out again. i requested this friday off from work thinking that i would go to niu to visit roger but that was before i signed up for classes so i'm not going until saturday but i will be spending the night there which will be good. mmmm spending the night! anyway so i really don't have any plans except maybe going to casino downtown with my manager from work but she has to check her money to see if she has enough to gamble with but anyway if not then i'll figure out something to do on friday. well im gonna go hop in the shower i have to take my car to the shop one of my lights is staying on and its getting annoying. peace everyone"

"event","last few days have been ok. i was sick on tuesday, i couldn't do anything that day i was so weak all i could was get up and go to the bathroom. i was still kinda groggy on wednesday when i went to the doctor with my parents. while we were waiting for my dad i was telling my mom about this school in new york that roger was telling me about. its a really good school for graphic arts thats the field i love and i can give all of my attention too. plus its a school roger wants to go if he gets accepted there. i have a pretty good feeling he will, but we both don't want to lose each other if he goes so we decided that i would apply too, since i will finish up with cod this year by the summer hopefully. but if not i can just send my info there and i can finish all of my stuff there. well my mom said, ""i don't know about that, there has to be schools closer than that."" granted i know new york is far away and all but i'm 23yrs old i can go where ever i want. i'm not a little kid anymore, i just want her to realize yes i am your baby your last born but i hope she didn't think i want to hang around here forever. i have a life of my own that i need to live out and i'm not going to be able to do that living here at home. i have someone special in my life and i want to spend my time with him. i know my dad isn't back to where he is able to be walking by himself but i don't want to be given guilt trips and stuff about my dad. i know you are suppose to take care of family yeah i do grasp that....though i have a right to my education and moving with my roger. but anyway i don't know whats going to happen. all i can do is what people have been telling me these past few days and thats just to follow my heart. well i gotta hit this homework that is due on saturday for geography class that is so boring. you know a class is boring when the instructor says ok we're gonna end class here and most of the people in the class say thank god under their breath. well talk to everyone later bye."

"event","saturday was a day with ups and downs, but its apart of life so you know it runs with the territory and all. the began really well and everything. steve came over and we went to go pick up roger because he was going with us to visit our friend kenyatta in calumet park. but on the way to get roger she told us not to come because she had some flu like bug and just got thru pucking before she called. so we ended up going to the movies to see white noise. oh my god that is the best movie i have seen in awhile. i have seen some pretty big stinkers in the past like catwoman and shit. but anyway after the movies we called mari and aaron to see if they wanted to hang out, we tried calling them earlier but no one answered. so on the way to tgi fridays we received the news that her grandfather passed that morning. we are still in shock of that because i know exactly how she feels because i lost my grandfather right before my graduation and i wanted him to come to it. he passed away in april 2001 just a month shy of graduation that was very devastating for me. i'm really trying not to think about it as much because i will just start thinking about my grandfather and i know i need to be strong for her because they were there when my grandfather passed. i know i can cry but i just don't want to do it around her because if we have two people crying im really no good to her then. but anyway they met us a tgi later on around 10pm so until that time roger, steve, and i were there for a couple of hours we were jsut chilling and laxing. after that shocker steve and i knew it was time for drinks. so steve got a mud slide, and i got the ultimate long island ice tea. oh my god that shit had different kinds of alcohol. and not only that it was in this big ass glass. as i had my drink it kinda helped me build up the courage to ask roger something very important that i never thought possible. i told him that in my heart that he is the one for me, and know there is no one else out there for me, and i would follow him to the ends of the earth....and then i asked him to marry me! i just put everything on the line in the back of my mind i was expecting a no, but i was shocked when he told me yes! oh my god i was so floored at that moment. even though despite a death happiness kinda shined through a little. we are not getting married right away though its going to be a long ways from now. so yeah hopefully before i turn 30 and shit. but i think its kinda cool because they have all of our jewelry 50% so while i was on break i found two engagement ring sets that i was looking at. but the one thing is that my friend at work was asking....well what did your parents say? i'm ummm....they don't know yet. i'm thinking about letting them know by email a long ways from now lol. because it was shocker when i came out to my mom, man i can only imaging what she is going to do i tell here ummm im engaged. lol well anyway thats bout it from my exciting weekend, i just got off from work an hour ago and just got thru eating, so i'm gonna take a nap before i go and get roger at 3. laterz all!"

"event","for the record new year's eve sucked just as halloween did last year! lets i think its dumb to invite people to a fucking party that never materialized. which was told to a bunch of people that you fucking work with at your job. and then call them and say you are picking up people and you will be back at a certain time but you don't answer the fucking phone because your ass ain't even at your house at the time you gave to people! not only did you leave people hanging but you just pissed off a great deal of your co-workers that are not to thrilled with your ass at the moment. another thing is that i hate when people say they will call me back but never do. i'm the one now doing the calling back and shit. because if memory serves me correct a long time ago a discussion was had with three people down my back complaining that i didn't call them back and shit when they called. i took it under consideration and i changed my ways. now it seems people are doing my old routine which makes no sense, because it wasn't ok that i did it but its ok that you do it to me! fuck that i am a human being just like everyone else i have fucking feelings too you know! and yes my feelings got hurt last night because plans were made but were altered which i didn't have a problem at all. but don't make plans with me and then leave me hanging promising me to call me back but never did. granted a person was running a lil late and all but still that hurt me alot last night. granted if you had other stuff you wanted to do and didn't want to hang out i would rather a person tell me then i would feel better about the situation and no feelings would have been hurt but leaving me in lingo was bogus to me. this is exactly why i go through withdrawal at times because i feel like people don't like me anymore and i'm not good enough. i don't know maybe its just my way of thinking but when stuff like this happens it kinda sheds more like on my thinking. so maybe its just time for me to drop off the face of the earth for 3 weeks or so like i do sometimes and i'll just concentrate on my roger, job, and family and stuff. although it kinda seems like roger and family is about all i got right now. but on a good note i hope everyone had a very happy new year. I can't wait to hear all of the stories well everyone sober up and have a good day."

"event","Its been a few days since I last updated this thing. Lets see oh yeah christmas was very good for me. I actually had the opportunity of having two jobs to be able to get lots of gifts for family and friends this year. I know the gifts are the most important thing though but its at least nice to spurge on the people that matter to you the most. I gots me some good goodies this year, although I must a admit there were some cheapskates who will remain nameless...but I know better next time. So shame on them! But anyway I spent Christmas with my family. No other family came to visit which is ok with me i would rather spend time with the 3 mofo's that live in this house anyway. Santa was good to me this year. I got a lot of cologne this year....but I don't have a hygiene problem so no santa wasn't trying to say that i smell. I got a cool as watch that is black and gold. i have never seen nothing like it i always like to get things look different, and shit for the price tag my mom forgot to take off its worth every penny. i also got white chicks the unrated and uncut version. oh my god that shit is too funny. they should have played that version in the theater. my brother hooked me up with some fly ass clothes this year. I never buy myself clothes so when someone is buying me clothes i really appreciate it. I don't know why i don't buy myself clothes, i guess i would rather spend my money on movies and shit but oh well. things with roger and i have been going on great. on monday steve went with me to pick him up, but i didn't know he had another gift for me. he's a real sweetheart, he bought me a sign language book and jolly rancher candy! jolly rancher's are my absolute favorite candy. man i couldn't even express how i felt about his gift. for that moment all i could do is kiss and hug him. i think i showed him how much i appreciated his gift and how much i love him later on. :-) on the way the to steak n' shake to meet mari and aaron steve was talking to him and some how i forgot the subjects of moving in together and getting married came into play. he was asking steve did he know where gay marriage was legal. i thought maybe he was joking but he was being serious, so maybe wedding bells might be coming soon i don't know. we hung out a sns for awhile. although through the night i was mostly talking to aaron and steve, while mari and roger talked. at the end of the evening mari told me that their entire convo was about me. Roger really wants to quit smoking because I guess i am addicted to ciggs alot. i most be or something otherwise he wouldn't count how many ciggs i can have in a setting. so far my most is 9, and he was telling mari that he wants to be with me forever and that my excessive smoking is going to render that. i feel all special now because someone else gives a damn about my health besides my mom. lately i have been looking at my smoking habits and i'm not going to lie its getting out of hand now. i have been looking at my bank statement and its not pretty. i keep seeing $3 here $4 here. some of them have no days in between them so yeah. im gonna try to cut down on the smoking. after sns roger and i went back to my house and watched white chicks and we got to snuggle with each other. i must say my mom is really starting to except the fact that roger and i are dating. she came downstairs at one point while we were kissing and she didn't even say anything to us. well to me anyway for that matter. i would have like to have done other things but my cock blocking brother had to show up with his girlfriend so we just ended up leaving. when i dropped him off we made plans to hang out this upcoming tuesday. i have been having really good days because of roger and i thank him for that everytime we see each other. when he goes back to school on the the 16th of january he is going to get weekend passes for me to spend the weekends with him and everything which is going to be great so we can actually have alot more time to spend with one another. this new years i have been invited to a drinking party by one of my co-workers. from what i hear she throws some kick ass parties were everyone gets drunk or high if you choose. she said i can bring my peoples to her crib. but im not for sure if i'm going or not. shit fuck it i'm going i got the whole entire weekend off. i'm bringing the peeps and we are going to have a good time. well anyway thats all i have to say i'm go lay down for a bit and then do some t.c.o.b. (taking care of business) that needs to get done. later peoplez"

"event","yesterday i got a chance to spend some time with my baby. it was really cool i got to meet his parents, his sister and his little brother. man that kid was eating candy like no tomorrow. he was bouncing off the walls and jumping off the steps. his mom was really funny she's like you are gonna break your leg if you keep doing that. we pretty much watched tv and enjoyed each other's company as usual. i cut the evening short because i thought i had to go to work last night but as it turns out i didn't so i'm kind mad at myself cuz if i didn't have to work i wouldn't have left so soon. i would have rather stayed and be with my man. but its ok i get to see him on saturday so its all good. shout to my baby roger i love you puddin! man i was so happy that it snowed yesterday man i just love snow so much. i like to play in it and have snowball fights. its kinda funny to get the christmas weather at thanksgiving. but its ok i'd rather for it to come early then to not come at all. i'm also glad it snowed because it kept family members at bay too! i know its kind a wrong to say that though but its like ok we have had nothing but people come to this house since easter and you know its like umm ok i don't want to be bothered with folks. its like damn stay at your own crib for at least one holiday. and not only that but when people want to come to your house it dampers your plans and i don't like to break plans i have already made, especially now that i got my baby saturdays are ours baby yeah! ain't no body taking the saturdays away forget that shit bitch! but anyway i want to take this time to tell everyone Happy Thanksgiving and i hope you all enjoy it. talk to everyone later, i luv yall, and be careful bye."

"event","i had a great time with roger again today! man how i love him so much! we went shopping today at walmart and target. roger got a few odds and ends at walmart while i picked him up something special from target. we went to mcdonalds to get something to eat. after we got done eating we went back to the dorms to chill and lax and make out...and some other things and we watched house of the dead. this movie is rogers favorite. its nice to sit and watch a movie cuddle up with the one you love. i have only had that opportunity once but i was used in a pawn. so this was very special too me. i love him very much and i would like to get a place with him and live together. i can't go without seeing him, its like he's my breath and i can't breathe when he's not near. but at least the wait won't be so long until i see him next. i will see him this wednesday before thanksgiving. i'm so glad he will be coming down for thanksgiving. he's my heart and soul, and i completely positive he's the one for me because otherwise i wouldn't be tearing up while writing this entry. he has impacted my life that i never thought was possible. i love his laugh when i make a mistake or almost trip. ok im gonna go on with the rest of the evening because i'm crying now. after i left my baby i met up with my friend mari, beatrice, and aaron at the hollywood blvd movie theater in downers grove. they had a late showing of the rocky horror picture show at midnight and they reenacted the movie while it was playing the movie was good except the dumbass people behind us yelling out stupid shit and adding in there own derogatory lyrics to the songs. i was so pissed i paid $8 for the movie and reenactment not stupid drunks that mess up a good movie. well anyway thats all i have to report for right now. i'll post later. Bye Roger aka lip master i will be off dreaming of you and waiting until the next time we talk and see each other. I LOVE YOU so much! and I MISS YOU SO MUCH! bye baby!"

"event","I just want to take this time to thank all of the people that have supported me in my quest to find the right person for me. Your tireless efforts of listening to me bitch and complain about people has been nothing more than supportive, loving, and caring. There are no words to describe my thanks for everyone that has given me advice and listened to me! I'm in a world of debt to your gratitude and all the words that have spoken to me. I just totally feel different now and I am liking the results. I also want to take the time to thank all of the people that didn't want me, used me for ass and other things. It may sound weird but I want to thank you because throughout the constant rejections, taking advantage of me and other things you have allowed me to find my other true half! So I appreciate all the nasty things that have happened to me because I have been able to get down, get up, get over, and get through all the hard times and literally the times I was almost a step of away from killing myself or just plain giving up hope on finding that special one. But now that I have found that one I have truly connected with him on a level I thought was never possible. For this the emptiness I have felt inside for the past 4 or 5 years is disappearing. Finally my body is being cleansed of all disappointments, cruelties, and heartbreaks. For that I am totally grateful and I am beginning be come at peace with myself. For the first time in my life I can honestly say I like myself I really do and now I'm working on loving me and loving myself the way god created me to be. I'm fine with who I am now and my sexuality. I always hid who I was because I was ashamed of who I was and who I liked. I felt like a big let down for my parents but then I came to realize god made this way for a reason and I do have a purpose on this earth that has kept me alive so far. Everyday is a test and some tests we fail and some we pass with no problems. No one will be able to ace them all except for god. I'm happy this way, and nothing will change that. Now that I have that special someone by my side I feel stronger and happier, not weak and worthless like I use to feel. My baby Roger loves me very much as I love him very much we are both glad and thankful to have found each other. Because for all the people out there that told me that I would find someone better that would love me for me and treat me how I wanted to be treated at first your advice kinda went in one ear and out the other at the time but, it makes all the sense in the world now. I am in utter debt to all the people that cared about me! Ok....now I started to feel all weird and shit because I have never written a journal entry so full love and high spirits. But its ok I like this feeling its good for me and I am in a new space and its a space where I should and where I definitely want to be in right now. Well thats all I have to say I think im gonna turn in good night yall and pleasant dreams....well I already know what I will be dreaming about hehe!"

"event","oh tonight was the most fucking best night i have had in years. i got spend the day with my baby boo. He is such an awesome person even though he is deaf i don't care about that. he is just hug-gable and kissable (well we did alot of that tonight but that'll come later) when i picked him from his dorm at niu we went to sns out in dekalb. you believe who was freaking out there at sns the creepy Mark manager with the red hair! he got promoted to a better position i guess. but anyway chilled there for about an hour, then we decided to go see the seed of chucky which is a very good movie. well we got the tickets early so we had about an hour and a half to waste so we went to back to my car made out in the parking lot. we were really bold because i parked in between two cars and the owners came out and got in their cars i'm pretty sure they saw us making out but whatever who gives a fuck! man oh god can that boy kiss like a mofo. not trying to be funny or anything but i guess since he can't talk he knows how to work his tongue. we were really going at hit. i haven't done anything like that in awhile but it felt oh so good. we finally released each other from out lip holds and went in to see the movie. nothing happened in the theater this time. for those that don't know i have the tendency to do some thangs in the movies but not tonight. like i said earlier the movie was awesome. after the movie we went back to his dorm and he showed me his drawings and his masterpieces of art. he's into graphic arts like i am so thats a love we both share right there. and the tour of his dorm room we went right back to making out! man all im gonna say is a lil something else was added to the mix and that just made it even more exciting and hot up in there. but unfortunately all things have to come to an end and i had to end up leaving at 11pm because the dorm has visiting hours and no visitors can be there past 11pm. but he told me the sweetest thing that just made me feel all warm inside. he said he wants my passion in my heart to melt with his passion in his heart to come together as one! and we both want to be with each other forever!  i did some thinking on the way home i want to communicate with him better so i have decided in the winter quarter coming up that im going to take sign language. because i do care for him alot and that i don't want to keep having to writing what each other is saying. i met two his friends that are also deaf as well but they can hear so they are able to speak to me but really cool peeps. if anyone wants to see a picture of him just click on the photo album link on my journal he's a real sexy beast! we already have nicknames for each other im his homoboy and he's my lip master boy because baby knows how to work that tongue. but anyway thats all i have to say right now and besides my damn mouth is hurting he wore my mouth out! ooh that just sends good shivers up and down my spine."

"event","nothing new to report except that i started my new job today and i really like it alot better then meijer. i'm still employed at meijer but they just call me as they need me to come in until my name is back in the system. but you know if not oh well they lost a good employee who caught a person stealing a last week. but yeah the new job is great i like it, i like the people there and i like the discount there too. and i like the fact that close at 7pm mon - thu. besides work and everything i haven't done anything. since the funeral i haven't hung out with anyone i haven't spoken to anyone. i don't know after the funeral my demeanor changed. i have just stayed at home and being by myself. i haven't smiled since saturday or laughed really. its just like i don't have the emotion to do either. i thought maybe righting down how i felt on here might help me get over my sadness to no avail it hasn't helped me at all. i use to think this thing was therapeutic but now anymore. i feel like this online journal is just a waste of time and energy spent that i could be doing something else with. nothing has changed since saturday and i still feel the same. i don't know if i need to go back on my meds or what but i haven't been happy within myself and the outside world in these past few days. i mean i want to go out and do stuff but on the same hand i don't want to either. im just kinda at crossroads right now and i'm just trying to figure out who i am, who other people are, who i want to be around, and who i don't want to be around. i guess this was coming a long time ago that i am ready to start dealing with the real stuff now and past the bullshit. my bullshit detector is on full blast and i can see past bullshit now so im gonna be giving into any temptations... like giving up the ass all that stuff. so yeah thats all i have to say right now."

"event","today was a very sad day. my friend rory moved to wisconsin so only god knows when i will see him again. then i went to the funeral for my dad's friend's son. i didn't think i would lose today at the funeral but i did. at the beginning of the service they ask for people to come up and say a few words in remembrance. at first no one was getting up which i thought was kinda rude considering that the funeral home was so packed that they had another room to view the service on closed circuit tv. a few moments later people started getting up. marlon was mr. bell's son that he had through his wife minnett. mr. bell was previously married so he was the only son out of the marriage with minnett. i talked about this person along time ago but sam is mr. bell's daughter. i had a major crush on her when i first met her and i still do to this day. she is one of the most beautifulest girl i have ever met. just her personality is so funny just like mine its just uncanny. when it was time to go around and view the body one last time my mom and i didn't bother to look into the casket because thats not how you remember someone you remember someone on the memories you had with them and everything. my mom gave mrs bell and sam a hug first, and then it was my turn. mrs bell told me to take care of my folks. her she is her only son is laying in a casket and she worrying about my parents. thats one hell of a human being and that truly ment a lot to me. i made her a promise that i intend to keep that i will take care of my parents. when came to hug sam and to finally talk to her in like months since we last seen each other. she told me that i looked really good and told her the same. i lost it at that point and i just burst into tears. i tried to keep it together but i just couldn't. but when i looked at sam i paused for a bit and walked away because she didn't need to see me emotional because that is not what her family needs right now. i continued to cry into my mothers arms. all of the loved ones that i have lost in my life came flooding back all at once. i just felt grief, hopeless, and helpless all at the same time. my parents were thinking about going to the cemetery but my mom just said that we weren't going to go because i wasn't in any shape to go to the cemetery. so we kinda left a lil earlier then we planned because i was just to emotional and i don't get like that in front of people. i don't know what it feels like to lose a child but i hope that its something that i never have to go through. our parents are expected to go before their children instead of the children going before the parents. i don't know how it feels but i watched my grandmother and grandfather go through that and its something really unbearable. i know my grandmother died of stomach cancer and my grandfather of blockage of fluids in his body but i think the reason for their deaths is that they died of a broken hearts from losing one their younger children. i mean i went out and everything today but today was just a front for me to not show my true emotions. to be quite honest i would have rather just stayed at home and cried all day. all i can say is life is too short for bullshit so if u have something against someone let it go because tomorrow is not promised to anyone and you could be dead yourself still holding on to a stupid grudge that wouldn't matter anymore because you are dead and you will go to grave still mad at people over the dumbest shit! so people lets wake the fuck up and fucking grow up! seriously its time to get down to business."

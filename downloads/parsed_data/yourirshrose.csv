"event","we'll I hope you all have been having a wonderful summer--I know I have been! :)  No school has definetly been awesome as well as the frequent tennis matches.  Fun times!  Kara and I are going to wait until later today to play tennis--at least until the sun goes partway down because it was supposed to be 95 degrees out today and there's no shade on the tennis courts! :)  

Not to much else has been going on here.  Kory and Rose got married last Saturday and it was beautiful.  I definetly want a wedding like that!  Beautiful is the only word to describe it...we all got teary-eyed at when the both went up and read the readings (it was like they were reading them to each other...awesome)...but wow.  The reception was awesome as well--I want a good Catholic reception like that as well!!  Rosie was glowing the whole night and Kory, who was looking quite handsome in his tux, was also all smiles. Adam taught me some dances which was fun as well as hitting the dance floor with Sarah, Kara, Jimmy, Elisa and Amanda for some of those good fast songs! lol!  I'm soooooooo excited about Jenny and Tony's wedding this Saturday!!!!!!!!!!!!   We're going to finish putting the wedding favors together with Jenny on Thursday after Praise Hour (which has been a ritual the last 3 times...:) ) so I'm excited. 

Then Uncle Bob, Grandma, Uncle Steve and Stephanie are coming out for a visit which will be fun!!!  There's going to be a God-father and God-daughter vs. God-father and God-daughter tennis match!  Teams being Uncle Bob and I vs. Uncle Steve and Kara.  Can't wait for that one!  Then we're going to hit up a Cubs game that Friday, campfires at my house, baseball at the park with the family.  It'll be an all around great time!  

Then world youth day retreats and stone country, ealge eye (sooooooo excited about eagle eye!!!!) and then world youth day shortly after eagle eye ends!  Wow--I get tired just thinking about everything but it's going to be so much fun! 

Anyway, I'm going to go hang out with Erik before his game tonight--talk to you all later!

Wow, it's been over a month since I've updated this livejournal.  That's just craziness! Since then, there's been lots of stuff that's happened!  

I'm finally out of school!!  yahoo!  You can not imagine how incredibly glad I am!  No more 'harvard on the hill' for me! (Billy--I'm talking about the REAL harvard on the hill...not the fake, name stealer school ICC...;-) ) Next stop for me, Francsican!  Speaking of Franciscan, it was absolutly awesome!!!  All the people there are absolutly amazing.  It was such a cool, very Catholic enviroment!  That's exactly what I'm looking for!  It's also swarmed with guys--very good Catholic guys.  THey come in all types, the very devout homeschoolers to the Catholic rappers (aaron--he was awesome!  he wrapped Sarah and I a song about JPII and chastity! *swoon*), so it'll definetly be cool to meet some more kids that are pumped up about their faith! I could go on forever about that though! 

Let see, I'm still working out at the rock...it's starting to get busier as the days are getting warmer and more people come out from Chicago to hike and whatnot.  That's pretty fun. :) 
The summer should be super fun!  I have some plans already, weekends are pretty full and weekdays are starting to fill up--craziness!  The days that don't get filled up, I'm going to relax at home, help the kids with the school work, play cards and games with Michael and Mary, and help my Dad do something with the back area of the house.  He wants to take all the gravel bricks out around the fire pit and shed out and put them by the hill and then put different brick in. It's fun--I get to be outside and work! :)  W

Anyway, I'm just rambling on now, so I'm going to get busy writing this CCD test for tomorrow! That's almost over as well! Also, I got a new cell phone, so I'll have to give you all my new number! :) 

Laters!

"event","Hey Everyone! 
I know I haven't updated for a while, sorry about that! It's been absolutly crazy here! It was ""your-10-page-papers-are-due' season at my school the last couple weeks and seemed like I had 50 papers to write! Most of them are done and now I'm going into 'test-in-every-class' season!  I had a quiz today which went pretty well, I have my biggest essay due in english comp, i have a test on friday, monday and tuesday! and I just took a test last week in my other class!  craziness!  It's all good though...I'm ready for this semester to be over so the more tests means the closer I am to being done! :) 

In other news, I'm getting super super excited about Franciscan!!!  Sarah and I have figured out that we might not be able to do ""quiet hours"" at Franciscan! ;-)  Especially since the other night I was talking to her at midnight and beyond and we were both laughing so hard we couldn't breathe!  I'm loading up on chocolate and cream soda for Sarah!! LOLOL!!!  mwa ha ha!  Um, a bunch of us are going to Stone Country in Peoria on Friday night which will be LOADS of fun!! We're picking up Erica as well...so yeah...it's going to be one heck of a partay!  I'm trying to convince Andy to wear his country cowboy stuff...I told him Steve was going to dress up (which is not true) and so he said... ""well, I do have a cowboy hat...""  so yeah, I totally want to get him to dress up! That'd be so funny! Hopefully he doesn't read this b/c he told me he never checks his livejournal...sooooo yeah! If you are reading it, Andy...umm...did I mention that Steve is dressing up on Friday? ;)  
Then we have a retreat on Saturday!  wootles!  I'll only be able to go for a little while b/c I have to work at 4...but I think I'm going to see if whoever comes back to my house just wants to come to the Lounge and watch the Illinois game in the bar with all the other Illini fans!  That'd be a blast!!! Holy moly! 
Then next week, Sarah and I go to Stuebenville!!!!!  The Hilborns used to live somewhat close to there, so they were telling me all of these cool places to go and yeah, they just got me all pumped up (well, MORE pumped up than I was) and yeah...quite fun! 
Anyway, I'm going to go start studying for my lovely test!  Later all!!

"event","Well, today was quite a relaxing day! :) 
I woke up this morning and finished my chores and then went to the Hilborns at noon.  Olivia was just leaving to go to a friends house and Master Erik was sick and in bed.  So, I took the dogs for a walk and played with Rusty, the new puppy who is adorable!!  Then I read a little of the book Sarah let me borrow (thanks sarah!) and got online for a little while and talked to Kara.  She told me that Erica was going to possibly stop by today so I got all excited but then erica got on a little later and told me that unfortunatly they were running late and didn't have time to stop! :(  
I talked to Miss Erica for a while and then Elizabeth all while watching ""The Notebook""  That is such a good movie!  Quite sad!  I finally got to talk to Jenni today!! We finally got each other! :)  Talked to her for quite a while about things that have been going on here and she was telling me all about stuff that happened over there! I'm still jealous about all the guys you got to see, Jenni, but we'll go to NYC sometime together! :)  mwa ha ha! 
I came home at 5 and talked to Miss Elizabeth for a while--I'm so siked about going up there!!  We're going to have bunches of fun!! 
Anyway,I think i'm going to go watch a movie....I'm not quite sure yet!  Goodnight everyone!"

"event","So, I'm sitting here babysitting--actually, the boys are playing playstation right now and are completley wrapped up in that, so I'm on the computer! :)  We just watched 'Mulan'---I LOVE that movie!  It's absolutly wonderful! (""Do you want to stay for dinner?""  ""Do you want to stay forever?!"" :) lol!)  They'll probably play PS2 until Joey comes over and then I'll make them lunch and then go home! wootles!  

I've been sick for the last couple days, which has been horrible! Especially when Helio asked me to work last night and I didn't want to say no because I asked off today and tomorrow.  So, I felt like I was going to drop dead and then I would smell the food and it would make my tummy turn.  Bleh.  Anyway, I'm feeling a little better, as far as energy goes.  I had a slim-fast earlier because it's like instant energy, and I haven't eaten for like 2 days b/c my stomach doesn't feel good so I need all the energy I can get!  Especially since I'm going rock climbing tonight and snowboarding on Sunday!  That will be so much fun!!!  I just hope that between now and then I'm doing a little better.  I don't mind if my throat is sore, but if my nose can clear up or if I can get some energy back, that would be awesome! 

I worked the rock star competition at Starved Rock on Thursday and that place is like one big cigarette during the competition so that helped my throat out tons!  The radio people, everytime they would order another drink, would breathe the smoke right into my face--nasty!  I will never smoke!  The radio man, while blowing smoke into my face, explained something to me which I thought was interesting.  he said that Absolute Vodka is better for you, easier on the brain and whatnot, and you don't get as much of a hangover as you would if you drank a different kind of vodka.  :)  Sometime to keep in mind! lol!

Anyway, I'm going to go enjoy the first morning of my very early spring break and go watch some meaningless tv! :-)   It's been ages since I've done that!  
Love you all!!!

"event","Well, it's been a while since I've actually written in this silly journal so I figured I would since I'm procrastinating writing my Philosophy paper.  Today was a very interesting day, but quite fun I must say. 
Spanish went well this morning with Lou telling us all some funny stories!  I swear, that man has done so many things it's great!  Some of them are quite unbelievable---as far as the things he did when he was in Paris and Ireland and Germany.  He went to some wineries over in Europe and told them that he was a distributor from New York and had made some fake buisness cards and whatnot.  Well, since he had all the right names down (from driving around town and getting them off of signs)  they loaded his car up with bottles and bottles of wine.  Well, the story goes on and is obviously MUCH better when he tells it, but yeah, it's quite entertaining.  
I got online for about an hour this morning which was great because I haven't just gotten online just to be online for a while!  I actually got to send a couple emails which was awesome as well! :)  Tiffany came in and we talked to Muffy and Andy for a while....fun times.  
Tiff. and I then found some couches and sat and talked while she looked over her stuff for her test and I wrote some more of my paper.  Good girl talk....awesome times! She gets to go to Flordia for Spring Break, which is totally not fair!  But I'm happy for her, because her and her sister will have an awesome time! I hope Carry talks tiffany into the highlights for her hair, because I just think that would be so much fun! :)  
I went to History which was quite boring...I have never lived through a longer 50 minutes than I did today for history class, or so it seems.  I just did not want to be there. Which is kind of strange because usually that class is interesting....we are getting into more government stuff, which goes right over my head, so that could be it as well.  
I saw Tiffany again after class and i think we're going to go to lunch tomorrow before they leave for Flordia.  Chineese or Mexican?  That is the question....hmmm.  So, Dan and I headed down to the cafeteria to get some food and ran into so  many people it was insane!  One person I saw was Allison Barsi who told me that Erica had her baby on Sunday.  A little girl....I forget her name but it was quite medieval, which I guess works for some people. Anyway, she said the birth went smoothly...Erica had her daughter at home, so yeah.  :) I told her congrats and whatnot.  I also talked to Cindy for a while about the crazy meetings at Starved Rock.  And!  I got a blueberry muffin today! Oh, I was so excited!  they never have blueberry anymore! :) wootles!  It made my day!  
ANyway, after we finally got out of the cafeteria....we went up to Six-0-Seven where they were in the middle of having a guy talk with Matt offering his comments and insights here and there.  (Brian couldn't be there today....btw) Anyway, I met a new girl, her name was Hannah and seemed pretty nice. The eventful thing was, that Matt got a hair cut.  Right there in room B-307. Yep, Hannah and Kelsey cut his hair while I took pictures and justina just looked on laughing and Dan was sitting there reading his book. People started to arrive and wait outside the classroom for their class and they were just kind of looking in the room wondering what we were doing.  Well, we walked out and a girl asked Kelsey what class we were in and Kelsey just looked at her and said, ""Haircutting-101""  And the girl looked and her and said, ""Really?""  Well, we all just started laughing and kelsey told that we were a group having a meeting....
But yeah, it was fun times!  And just for the record, Matt's haircut turned out quite nicely. :)  Pat was in the room at the same time saying how horrible it was that we were cutting matts curls off....lol!  He still has some curls and especially when he goes home and washes his hair it'll be more curly b/c he will have less hair! :)  
Anyway, I must go now, and work on finishing my paper!  Love you all!

"event","Hey Everyone! 

I just have to say, that Josh Groban was absolutly divine!!  It was an absolutly AWESOME concert and I'm so glad I didn't miss it!! (Thank you again Jenni!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) Jenni and I were in the 7th row and have TONS of great pictures that I'm posting in a photo album in yahoo right now, so I will definetly link them for you!! Oh my!!!!  He sings so wonderfully!!  it was just awesome!!  We tried to rush the stage, but we went the wrong way--the way with security guards, so we weren't able to get up there! Next time though!!  For if Josh is going to be our husband, we have to meet him somehow! :) Oh wow!  I'm so glad everyone else had fun! :) 
Afterwards, we all went over to Miss Sarah's house to spend the night.  Before we did that though, Jenni and I went to Steak and Shake to get ourselves a hamburger for it was midnight and we really wanted meat!  Anyway, it took 30 minutes to get through the silly drive-through!  Isn't that just craziness!!  Then we went to pick Miss Catherine up and headed back to the Burkes house.  Well, I felt soooooooo bad (and still do!) because they had called Jenni's phone 11 times to see if we were okay and it was still on silent from the concert so we didn't get any of the calls.  So, Sarah told me that Mrs. Burke was shaking b/c she was so worried and Sarah herself started praying rosaries for us--praying that we were okay of course.  I'M SO SORRY!!!!!!  So I had dreams about that all night--me apologizing to Mrs. Burke.  *sniff*  Sorry!  
Anyway, I came home and was so tired that I fell asleep on the couch right by all of my bags and slept until 5:45 only b/c I had to babysit at 6.  It's horrible! 
I also think I know why I'm so tired all the time.  We were talking in Pys. about REM and NREM sleep.  Well, REM sleep is the deepest sleep you can go into and it helps you recoop mentally.  NREM sleep is and sleep that isn't REM and helps you recoop physically.  Well, I haven't been sleeping much lately so obviously I'm not getting all of my REM sleep (even though there is REM rebound...) that i need.  Especially since there is sooooo much going on mentally and psycologically.  Anyway, that was my deep thought for the day.  ;-)  
I'm going to try to figure out how to upload pics on this website so I can post a couple of JOsh pictures!!!  
Love you all!!!!!

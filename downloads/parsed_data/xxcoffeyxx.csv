this sucks.


aww stretch arm strong is one of my favorite bands of all time:


all these years and no conclusion
a bitter end to each passing day
so alone now, so angry, so much confusion
you lose again, things always stay the same

and so you feel you're falling down
life's ropes are cut, lying all around

a landslide of nameless faces
these lost souls
they come from a million places
no sense of home, feels like you don't belong
a landslide, we missed what you had to offer

how could you fight this endless battle?
the killers, they're armed to the teeth
and I know you're scared of this lonely struggle
no acceptance, fulfillment's out of reach

and so you feel you're falling down
life's ropes are cut, lying all around
left with no help to push on through
more and more of the pressure was killing you

a landslide of nameless faces
these lost souls
they come from a million places
no sense of home, feels like you don't belong
a landslide, we missed what you had to offer

quietly dying
desperately crying
silently trying
we never knew you

a landslide of nameless faces
these lost souls
they come from a million places
no sense of home, feels like you don't belong
a landslide, we missed what you had to offer"

Finals week has rocked... <a href=""http://chelseababbishadventures.blogspot.com/""> Read about how I almost got car jacked here</a>.

Red lights are flashing on the highway
I wonder if we're gonna ever get home
I wonder if we're gonna ever get home tonight
Everywhere the waters getting rough
Your best intentions may not be enough
I wonder if we're gonna ever get home tonight

But if you brake down
I'll drive out and find you
If you forget my love 
I'll try to remind you
And stay by you when it don't come easy

I don't know nothing except change will come
Year after year what we do is undone
Time keeps moving from a crawl to a run
I wonder if we're gonna ever get home

You're out there walking down a highway
And all of the signs got blown away
Sometimes you wonder if you're walking in the wrong direction

But if you brake down
I'll drive out and find you
If you forget my love 
I'll try to remind you
And stay by you when it don't come easy

So many things that I had before
That don't matter to me now
Tonight I cry for the love that I've lost
And the love I've never found
When the last bird falls
And the last siren sounds
Someone will say what's been said before
Some love we were looking for

But if you brake down
I'll drive out and find you
If you forget my love 
I'll try to remind you
And stay by you when it don't come easy



who would sing this song for me?
nobody.

thanks, josh for giving me this music. I love it so much."

"event","this week I had four different people on four seperate occasions completley stand me up.

as in make plans with me and act all excited about them then leave me hanging all alone in the place we were supposed to meet or at home with no answer to a phone call when i call to ask ""whats goin on?"" or calling 6 hours later to tell me they decided that they made other plans. 

I HATE THIS because one day long ago I made plans with a loved friend and possible relationship that didn't work out and I ended up getting stood up. Not a big deal except that I didn't hear from the kid and knew absolutly NOTHINIG about what happened to him, why he stood me up, and what the heck went on for SIX ENTIRE MONTHS. I thought it was me or it was him or maybe something bad happened and a million zillion other things. Nobody could help me out nobody had the answers. <b> it was a crazy time </b> and months later, when things got resolved, I understood what happened and really, nobody could have done anything about it I guess. BUT regardless if I understand now, the situation of past still affects me today and especially during horrible weeks like these when people think it's no big deal to string me along and leave me all alone after even calling ME to confirm that we had plans (just like that one time so many years ago). This really hurts me and I guess it wouldn't be a big deal if it was only ONE person this week or whatever but the fact that it happened 4 times. wtf

and i'm not one of those people who is just gonna sit around and mope because someone doesn't call me. I'll call them and be like hey whats up because I don't ever think that someone is actually gonna stand me up. I'm usually worried that something happened to them or wondering if someone just forgot.  I'm an optomistic person and the first thing on my mind is very rarley the negative. This sucks even more though because I don't expect it from people and when it happens it crushes my heart.

did you read that world?

crushes my heart.

and on top of that REALLY pisses me off.
it's one of my only ""things"" when it comes to friendships and relationships. You GOTTA tell me if you aren't gonna come over or if you decided you weren't gonna meet me at the coffee house. The past had me broken for quite some time and although I have recovered, I sure haven't forgotten. Please stop reminding me how this feels, ""friends"".

on another note, I suck as a person as well so I guess I deserve it."

http://www.veritazproductions.com (our pro website is in the works while we are on the road... right now it's just text but the good one is on it's way!

I'll be on the road touring with Rally Across America for the next about three weeks and then continueing to produce them from Savannah during my summer classes until I return again to the tour as they finish up strong in September. The two other core film crew team members that I've hired to volunteer their time on the film will be staying for the duration of the trip on the road also acting as the Rally support team in the support car.

Updates from the road will be posted here and on the company webpage. Video updates about the experience will be found on the Rally Across America webpage. The weather channel will also be checking in on us here and there using footage from the ride that I'm shooting for national television weather updates, ex: let's check in with the Rally team and see what the weather is looking like!

Please forward the webpage on and tell people about the film! Donations to the Rally foundation don't help us at all because they go straight to childhood cancer research but a donation to Veritaz Productions goes straight to the documentary being made and helps FEED the film crew for the 3 long months that some of them will be on the road.

"event","(taken from my brother's last article in his high school news paper)
  
 As a preschooler, I mistakenly thought that if I ran around the
jungle gym at top speed the wind would cool me down from the stresses
of previous playing.  One thing that I learned in high school (that I
probably should have learned in preschool) is that I cannot overcome
my present struggles by simply loading on more stresses.  Sometimes,
it can be the maturest decision to harness one's dreams, and settle
with a more realistic mediocrity.
       Around this time, the early yellow dandelions transform into a
fragile rhubarb-esque stalk, whose sole purpose is to rid itself of
what beauty it has left in the fuzzy seeds it contains.  A gentle
breeze can dismantle one's individual persona, but kids like me
appreciate the yellow infestation sprinkled throughout the front lawn.
       My final summer in which I can live as a careless teenager is here.
I can't wait to lounge for hours to the rhythmic motion of lawn
sprinklers, or just wasting time with friends circled around chopped
trees transcending into smoke.
       Dandelions are indeed the most efficient, and therefore beautiful, of
flowers.  However, one's beuty can be viewed as a weed to anyone old
enough to operate lawn equipment.  Fly a kite, trample the yellow,
and stay young.

Involved? Yes, I have written it, am directing most of it, dp-ing one scene, and pretty much casted the entire film (all 40 actors in it) all in a matter of about 5 weeks. 
The group I'm working with is amazing and the Lord has blessed us so much.

It's got me at the end of my rope though. How come everything always goes wrong with filming stuff...

heck, I even secured a location in the projects.

Please pray for the project's outcome, my team, and me. PLEASE.
Start now.
We film until Sunday and I'm STILL LookING for a few actors. Must be over 30.

Check it out, the psalm today is this:

<b>(122) 
For the peace of Jerusalem pray:
""May those who love you prosper!
May peace be within your ramparts,
prosperity within your towers.""
For family and friends I say,
""May peace be yours.""
For the house of the LORD, our God, I pray,
""May blessings be yours.""

Hofstein pulled me aside and asked me why I wasn't taking his 12 hour a day bull-crap diriecting the short story or whatever class.
I told him it was becasue I'm already successful and any more success would be just too much.

"event","hello there. I would like to make a quick dedication of lj entry to KATE MAHER(1) and KEVIN VanDUYNE(2) and KHALIL ALBATHY(3) right now 
because 
without them 
I would probably never have gotten into metal and hardcore music and if I had never gotten into the music, the culture, and the love of that stuff... My life would most definitely have killed me by now and if not, it would definitely suck and I'd be missing out on one of the single most wonderful types of music on the planet. 
muahahaha

<b>Thank you, Kate and Kevin </b>

_______footnotes_________

(1) Kate Maher, although not an avid hardcore fan herself, was there at my first ever hardcore show and helped nurse my love of the genre through undying support. If it was not for Kate's smooth talking and dedicated family, we would have never convinced my like-a-rock-when-it-comes-to-rules parents to let me go to Cornerstone Festival in 2000. Without you, Kate, I would have never seen StretchArmStrong play live at the Encore stage, Zao play the night away, and Living Sacrifice tear it up on the main stage with fire and smoke. Kate, you were there for it all. <3

(2) Kevin VanDuyne, a boyfriend for 3 years during high school, did his best to introduce me to hardcore music like NIV, Overcome, and Stretch, but had no success.  Upon returning from Cornerstone in 2000, however, and experiencing great shows first hand for 5 straight days, I returned home to share this new found interest with him, along with all of his cd's. Thanks, Kevin for contributing to my exposure and providing your companionship once I finally, found out for myself how much I was missing.

(3) Khalil, I think we can all agree, brought the art of hardcore dancing to the state of michigan. way to go kid.
oh yeah, God played a huge roll too, duh. NIV? come on.

"event","So I went to Atlanta yesterday night for a few hours. Mattie, my ultimate roadtrippin brotha of another mother and I packed up and peeled out of Savannah around 3:30pm and Ended up in Atlanta about 4 hours later only to leave around 12:30am to return to Savannah. yea... haha

Why did I go to Atlanta? For a conversation. 

There's this band that has been on a huge tour for a while now. Their tour came to Atlanta and I haven't really had a chance to catch up with the guys in a while.

recap:
The boys in this band ended up on my front porch a few months back because they had a show in Savannah and no place to stay. We stayed up until the wee hours of the night talking about God and what we feel we are called to do in life and all sorts of other things. I had a great time with them and felt like I really connected particuarly with 3 of them.

ANYWAY, we have kept in touch (as much as a person can keep in touch with someone who constantly breaks their cell phone) but I really wanted to connect with them again before the summer. I really felt like I could count on two of them (especially this one) and I wanted to see if what I felt when we spent time together so many weeks ago was real or if they just thought of me as another person that they met on tour. (I didn't really think this but it was possible and i HAD to prove that wrong. scarry though when you aren't sure how you will be recieved) I dunno why but I felt like it was really important to reconnect. It's not every day you meet people like these two guys. It's hard to find Christians that are on the edge, taking risks, and doing what they love to do most. I felt like I could really relate to them and seriously, that's important. I don't get to meet people like that often and when I do, I want to keep them you know? 

Lauren is one of those people.
Nick is one of those people. 
Hawk is one of those people.

I don't care how far away a person is, what they do in life, or where they're from... those following the path the Lord made for them with boldness and hope are the people in life that are gems, it's sooo important to keep them close.

ANYWAY
I didn't get to see either of them the entire time I was at the show. I cought up with their merch kid who was is such a sweetheart and their front man who is also so nice and invitinig but all I really wanted to do was talk to at least one of these two other guys. The show ended and we still hadn't seen them so we figured they had already left and so, upset and feeling defeated, Mattie and I decided to get going back to the long 4 hour drive home.

On our way out, the man I came all of that way to see was on his way in. I cought his eye from the stairs and he eased away all of my worries about goinig there and being recieved as who knows what and not being remembered.  The hug he gave me was so strong I almost cried. Holy crap was it good to see his face and talk to him. I drove a long way just to do that. Turns out the other one had already left because he had thrown his shoulder out and had basically had a long week. This one, however, was still there and he was so encouraging. He was the main one I wanted to talk to anyway. I missed hearing his voice and couldn't wait to hear what God was doing for him personally in his life. He pulled Mattie and me outside and I got the conversation I was searching for. I also got the chance to tell him how much I enjoyed his visit when he was in Savannah and about how important I think it is for us all to keep up with each other. I wanted him to know I thought of him and the other as important connections in my life and that they are special and should know it. Thank God the feeling was mutual. Thank God I have a cell phone now so it is actually possible to keep up with someone far away (haha)

Who goes to Atlanta for a conversation?
hopefully more than just me. If you know more people like this please send them my way:)

why? because when God puts somebody in your life that you can connect with, learn from, be inspired by, and be a companion to, it is so important to cherish that person as a gift and to keep them as close as you possibly can.

here is my encouragement to you:
Go ahead and risk your heart. If you don't take those chances in life you will never taste the full potential  of friendship or be embraced by the full potential of love. Life is short... don't be afraid to live it. When you trust in God he will paint wings on your ankles and you will be able to sail steady through the risks life invokes. 

I'm seriously still on a high from Thursday night. I can't wait to see those kids again.
Man, when I get out of school it's going to be crazy. Who knows what is going to happen...... !!!"

He left at 2:30am after he finished his work (which was beautiful btw) and I fell asleep again. I woke up 30 seconds before my alarm at 8am and then somehow fell asleep after my alarm went off and woke up at 5 to 9. My classes start at 9 today and I really didn't feel liike being late to my first one so here I am at almost 10am skipping Senior one and taking an over all ""sick day"".
I am, however, feeling much better than I felt yesterday and I think playing LACROSSE yesterday, although it was HARD on the body because I kept not being able to breath because of this illness, REALLY HELPED. 
I will play again today if I can. 

Yay for pick-up games in the park.

I'm going to Gallery to get some Bronchial Tea for my lungs and to work on a paper for my 3pm class. I have the dvd for my 12pm class in my hand.
On top of my game? I think so but usually when I think so I'm forgetting SOMETHING really important.

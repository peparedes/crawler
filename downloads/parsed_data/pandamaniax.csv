"event","So I haven't updated my journal in freakishly long time, not because I was busy, but because I simply lost interest- like with Friendster; after a few weeks with Friendster, I got sick of it, and quit using it. Anywhoo, I'm now updating my journal because I actually have something worth writing about. So during this week, Minh and JR came by at UCSD for a late afternoon visit....haven't seen either in about a year now...but I only got to see them for about an hour, as I was at work for the entire day.

Which comes to my next update- so I'm now officially someone who can be taxed to death beyond all reason by the IRS. I'm just working as a filing clerk just a few minutes off campus, but I'll be able to put in even more hours (at least I better) once summer arrives since I'll be staying in San Diego for vacation. Why? Because I'm in such a desperate need for money and work experience, I've committed my entire summer just to work- I'm in SD all by myself just so I can wake up before 7 AM and leave at 5 PM, but it's worth it, or it should be worth it...er...it better be...My original plan was to both work and go to summer school for my GE's, and seeing how the summer class would scheduled after working hours during night, i thought it would be a good plan, but it turns out that class is EVERY FUCKING WEEKDAY, MON-FRI, FOR 4 INSANE HOURS. Fuck it.

So assuming for the summer that I'd be working every weekday from 8-5 with an hour lunch , I'd spend 9 hours at the office daily...and assuming I had summer school, I would have to spend 4 hours after 9 hours of work in a classroom. 

Yeah

Right

Absurd

On another note, I've been paying close attention to American Idol since the beginning of the season- my roommates and I were just addicted. And apparently Enming, my gay navy ROTC roommate who probably hails from some Coronado sailor-wanna hump hump bar, has some very strange tastes in women...which doesn't surprise me if he were gay, but it certainly would either question his sexuality if we THOUGHT he were straight, or would just make all of us look at him with raised eyebrows if he WERE straight. Not that Diana DeGarmo is fugly or anything (but in all truthfullness, she looks like a pug, and I would rather choose a slut from a 2-dollar whore house), but when someone wails to the TV whenever Diana DeGarmo appears on American Idol, moaning ""marry me, marry me.... i love Diana Degarmo"" or when they put a subtley lewd pose of Jennifer Connelly on their desktop background (again, not that Jennifer Connelly is horrific, but there's nothing special about her honestly), or when they seem to have a preference (or rather a fetish) for women in high status and power (say for instance the busy female executive who is more masculine than feminine), you really begin to feel uncomfortable around such a person- in this case my roommate- and in which case (and I daresay I should qualify here) I'm not BEGINNING to feel uncomfortable as opposed to being CONTINUOUSLY disturbed- or is it ""continually""?)

BUT- back to my original point in matter- Fantasia deserved to win, and not that she even needed that honor or even needed the show- she's a fucking power house. But in either case, congrats to her. Unfortunately for the runnerup, she will never compare to last year's runnerup Mr. Aiken. That being said, the new show on the WB, ""Superstar"", although being hailed by some as a disgrace and just plain mean, is actually doing something moral and necessary for America. Think about it: there are 70,000 contestants on American Idol who honestly believe they can sing, but waste our time doing horrific renditions of what USED to be some of my favorite songs. Don't THINK about auditioning in the HOPE or CHANCE that you can make it big, because it will NEVER happen. What the fuck are you thinking?? Telivision doesn't just need Simon Cowell, they need a show like ""Superstar"" to go the extra light-year and tear apart whatever pride these people have for themselves. 

* But, the paradox here is that without these devastingly ability-lacking contestants, American Idol wouldn't be nearly the fun as it currently is. So with a straightforward contradiction: Kudos to all of you peoples. I wish you well on your continuing perserverence to become the next American Idol.

On another note, Scott Maghy recently reprised his role as ""blonde Scott""...if you don't know about it already(and most people won't even have a clue) I suggest you ask her...

I just got off of from work- I'm tired, exhausted, and still have homework for two classes and one quiz for tomorrow. 

Leave me alone."

"event","so in the morning today, john f. kerry came to the ucsd campus to hold a campaign rally for his bid as president. after i left class, i decided that i would attend the rally too, so walked over to where he was supposed to speak, but it was too crowded to see anything; although there balconies and higher stories where i could have seen him from, they were blocked off by men in suits and sunglasses- yes, those plain clothes bodyguards are just so inconspicuous. although i had my camera, i decided that it wasn't worth the wait to take pictures of the presidential hopeful; i walked back to my dorm where, conveniently enough, the rally was being televised live. sad thing was, kerry was like 20 minutes late, but it was better to wait in my living room than wait under the sun. so kerry spoke about energy and gas prices and as usual, spoke in a VERY senatorial and aloof fashion...you know...where you don't speak in sentences but in paragraphs instead...

on an intersting note, here are some similarites kerry has with another famous democrat:

- john kerry has the same initials as john f. kennedy: jfk
- he is a democratic senator from massachussetts like kennedy
- he was a naval officer during wartime in the pacific rim just like kennedy
- he comes from a wealthy catholic family just like kennedy
- if elected president, he would be the first person SINCE kennedy to have been elected to the presidency directly from the senate (dubya was governor, clinton was governor, bush sr. was vice president, reagan was governor, carter was governor, ford was vice president, nixon was vice president, johnson was vice president)"

George W. was a happy little monkey. He lived on an estate in Texas without a care in the world.

<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4dd20b3127cceb9c23d2729900000001610"" alt=""2"" />
One day George W.'s father, the man with the big trust fund, sat him down to have a talk.
""George W.,"" said the man, ""I am going to take you all the way to the White House. Now run along and raise lots of funding, and remember to embrace the center without alienating the radical right."" 
He made George W. promise to behave. But curious little monkeys often get into big trouble

<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4dd20b3127cceb9c23dd529620000001610"" alt=""3"" />
At school George W.'s fraternity brothers told him to put powder up his nose. George W. was very curious. The powder made his nose all tingly! Suddenly his heart was pounding. Then he was the biggest monkey on earth! Then everyone was out to get him and a million locusts were devouring his face. Then his memory went fuzzy...

<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4dd20b3127cceb9c23d50a8d70000001610"" alt=""4"" />
Soon George W. had so much work to do! 
He had to sign his name to long pieces of paper. 
He had to appear at department store openings.
He had to choose who lived and who died!
They told George W. a man could live if he would just sign his name to a piece of paper. Instead George W. had ice cream! The lights of his mansion flashed on and off. But then they came back on again.

<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4dd20b3127cceb9c23d4b29fc0000001610"" alt=""5"" />
Some men asked George W. to debate the vice president. They sure had a lot of questions!
""Mr. Governor, could you elaborate on your plan for campaign finance reform?"" asked Sam Donaldson.
""How do you respond to accusations that your Social Security numbers don't add up?"" asked Tim Russert.
""How would you address a potential conflict between Taiwan and a new, militant China?"" asked Bernard Shaw.
They asked and asked and asked and ASKED! But George W. didn't know. He was just a monkey after all!

<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4dd20b3127cceb9c23d2ea8a90000001610"" alt=""6"" />
So George W. grabbed onto a balloon and flew off into the sky.
""Won't you answer our questions?"" asked the reporters. But George W. was too high to hear them. And so he flew all over the country, way up in the sky, where it was nice and quiet, until he finally landed in early November.

<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4dd20b3127cceb9c23de329540000001610"" alt=""7"" />
George W. knew he had been naughty, and he was sad. But it was hard for anyone to stay angry with George W. because he was so curious!
And so the man with the big trust fund forgave George W. 
And the Republican National Committe forgave George W.
And 46% of all registered voters forgave George W. too.
So George W. and the man with the big trust fund, got into their limo and drove away...

<img src=""http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b4dd20b3127cceb9c23ded295a0000001610"" alt=""8"" />
to the White House!
Now, isn't that the perfect place for a monkey to live?"

"event","if there's one thing i can boast about with regard to having fun down in san diego, it's tiju fucking juana. my god. saturday night was wild. my neighbor's friend from ucla brought along some of her sorority girls (omegas i think) and the night was just awesome. i almost DROVE into mexico when i should've parked in the U.S. and walk to the border (driving your car in tj is not exactly what i or anyone would consider a smart thing to do). but luckily i got off the freeway and was able to park outside the border. as usual, we packed the taxi ride to the club with about 6 people per cab and headed off to ""mystery"", a club i hadn't been to. once inside, it was alcohol galore, but i didn't drink as i was driving. moreover, it's more fun to stay sober and watch your roommates gets drunk. we danced, drank, and mingled well, although there were some strangers- some random guys that kept getting a bit too close to some of the girls in our group on the dancefloor, just out of nowhere- but naturally, the guys in our group confronted them- not to intimidate them, but to show them the depth of their stupidity. we stayed in the club until 3, although i was already getting tired just after 2 am, and it was back to U.S. soil. the night was hella fun- and i did NOT just write ""hella""... check it. i didn't....a few lap dances here and there and it was back to the campus."

"event","as i am writing this instant, i am waiting for paper towels to soak up the remains of what was an overflowing toilet. i use the word ""remains"" instead of simply ""water"" for 3 reasons:

1. it would be an understatement
2. it would be misleading
3. it would be a fucking lie

you see people, as i walked in the bathroom to put away towels, i noticed that the toilet bowl had no water in it whatsoever except for some soaked rags of toilet paper and um.. ehem...bits and pieces of scattered...er...products of relief.

so i flushed the toilet.

HOWEVER, the water coming IN the toilet bowl was coming in at a HIGHER rate than what was bein flushed. a MUCH higher rate. hence overflowing. my reactions were not fast enough as i tried to stop the running water after lifting up the tank lid. oh i stopped the running water, but i hardly prevented the overflow of human fecal matter. 

needles to say i panicked. 

i got the plunger and unclogged the toilet which finally flushed normally afterwards. i put the plunger in the tub to set aside and came to phase two of the problem: the soaked floor. although i probably didn't appreciate it at the time, i'm glad to say now that there was no floor mat or towels on the floor beforehand and am also glad to say that the overflow was limited to less than a fifth of the floor's surface area. 

but how the hell do you soak that much fluid off the damn ground? i tried a mop; however, to squeeze it back dry and thus be able to soak up more matter, i would have to use my own hands. but not to worry, i could use  gloves- IF WE HAD ANY! at this point, i began shouting profanity while going up and down the stairs, to the storage closets, and from the bathroom. we HAD disposable gloves, but thanks to my sister, they are all gone now after she needed to protect her hands from hair products she likes to use to give her hair a fake color.

my last resort was paper towels. i took two rolls and started laying them out on the bathroom floor. to pick them up and throw them away, i used an old toy of mine- you know, one of those sticks that had a hand at the end of it with a mechanism handle at the other end so it can pick things up.

i am nowhere near done with the job.

       this sucks.

            have a good laugh...

                    at my expense.

"event","PADERBORN, GERMANY - Overzealous zookeeper Friedrich Riesfeldt fed his constipated elephant Stefan 22 doses of animal laxative and more than a bushel of berries, figs and prunes before the plugged-up pachyderm finally let fly-and suffocated the keeper under 200 pounds of poop! Investigators say ill-fated Friedrich,46, was attempting to give the ailing elephant an olive oil enema when the relieved beast unloaded on him like a dump truck full of mud. 

""The sheer force of the elephant's unexpected defecation knocked Mr. Riesfeldt to the ground, where he struck his head on a rock and lay unconscious as the elephant continued to evacuate his bowels on top of him,"" said flabbergasted Paderborn police detective Erik Dern. ""With no one there to help him, he lay under all that dung for at least an hour before a watchman came along, and during that time he suffocated. It seems to be just one of those freak accidents that happen."""

"event","after watching ""lord of the rings- return of the king"" anything i can force my mouth to say would be a severe understatement to the film. this was the best of the 3 movies and it had to be, in order to give the trilogy a fitting and satisfying end. while waiting in the line for nearly 3 hours with minh, tim, clara, diana, colleen to name a few, with frequent visits from doug and colleen's heighthwise counterpart jun (who actually, after side by side comparison last night, is actually taller than colleen), we started to get insanely bored. luckily for our amusement, tim brought his digital camera and was taking snapshots of LOTR fans dressed as characters from the films, or as doug called them people who have costumes but no dignity whatsoever...hilarious. to some of us, it reminded us of triumph the insult dog harrassing star wars fans at the ""attack of the clones"" opening. Also, some guy for his own amusemnt, sat down on a bench holding a sign that asked passersby to kiss him on the cheek. hilarious, but disturbing.

we finally got inside about an hour before curtains, but that still gave us an hour of nothing to do. but we had good seats though. a few rows down there were some guys who doug labelled as the end of their species as we know it; natural selection at its work. a bunch of dense, teen white guys were playing rock, paper, scissors, where the loser had to get slapped HARD on the face. everyone was watching them and even gave them a round of applause. hilarious, but stupid (but badly needed entertainment and amusement for us). after a while, doug wanted in... *table 6*

there was also a short conversation about film; charlie chaplin as a mirror of early 20th century american society? hmmm...interesting. pulp fiction was briefly mentioned as was my infamous walken impression. 

then,lights dim, film starts, and i'm in awe and bewilderment for the next 3 hours. brilliant. i won't say anything more about the movie- i leave that to the viewer. 

kudos to tim for showing me the first two LOTR on dvd at his ""penthouse"" dorm. i really hadn't seen them before then. shame on me."

"event","who the hell ever knew the day would come that i would finally create a livejournal for myself...unprecedented. absurd. unfound. insane. unimagineable. but not impossible. for those who don't know by now, i'm at ucsd under earl warren college. dorm life is awesome, especially when you have a 900 square foot apartment. my roomates are awesome too; 2 are from norcal and one's from hacienda heights (my roommate). his name is enming. he's in navy rotc. he giggles like a little girl (while he's awake AND asleep). he tries to assert his masculinity by listening to hard metal rock music on the radio and reciting military sayings (but it's just hilarious when he starts practicing his drills with an imaginary rifle just randomly). but he's a nice guy. 

la jolla is a beautiful, picturesque setting for any college campus, let alone a city. but one thing i realized well after 2 weeks, was that there was absolutely nothing to do. it's just a rich white people's beach community. but one of the advantages of living in la jolla is the convenience of the mexican border. tijuana is too awesome, but also too damn filthy. on my first visit, i thought we'd all be greeted with open arms by night clubs and bars. instead, we were greeted with a little girl trying to sell us chiclets. yes- it's not just a stereotype; they actually sell you CHICLETS. 

watching your own roommates getting drunk is also much more fun than getting drunk yourself, but it's not so fun when you have to carry them to bed or when they feel the need to regurgitate their dinner on your lap. 

fast forward to december and i'm done with finals. economics was fair as was calculus. just those two finals. how sweet. but i had to do a research paper for my mandatory writing class- it was on american pop culture (focused on film) and globalization. i expect no less than an a. at least i HOPE for nothing less. but now that i'm back, i can finally make more frequent trips to IKEA. the one dollar frozen yogurt alone is worth it. 

i'm tired. i'm happy. i'm hungry. 
go figure.

and i'm also using livejournal.
go figure that one while you're at it."

<b>2. WHAT I AM NOT</b>

My brother and I used to play a game. I'd point to a chair. ""THIS IS NOT A CHAIR,"" I'd say. Bird would point to the table. ""THIS IS NOT A TABLE."" ""THIS IS NOT A WALL,"" I'd say. ""THAT IS NOT A CEILING."" We'd go on like that. ""IT IS NOT RAINING OUT."" ""MY SHOE IS NOT UNTIED!"" Bird would yell. I'd point to my elbow. ""THIS IS NOT A SCRAPE."" Bird would lift his knee. ""THIS IS ALSO NOT A SCRAPE!"" ""THAT IS NOT A KETTLE!"" ""NOT A CUP!"" ""NOT A SPOON!"" ""NOT DIRTY DISHES!"" We denied whole rooms, years, weathers. Once, at the peak of our shouting, Bird took a deep breath. At the top of his lungs, he shrieked: ""I! HAVE NOT! BEEN! UNHAPPY! MY WHOLE! LIFE!"" 
""But you're only seven,"" I said.   


<lj-cut text=""5. THE DEAD SEA IS THE LOWEST PLACE ON EARTH"">
Sometimes I imagine my own autopsy. Disappointment in myself: right kidney. Disappointment of others in me: left kidney. Personal failures: kishkes. ... When the clocks are turned back and the dark falls before I'm ready, this, for reasons I can't explain, I feel in my wrists. And when I wake up and my fingers are stiff , almost certainly I was dreaming of my childhood. ... Yesterday I saw a man kicking a dog and I felt it behind my eyes. I don't know what to call this, a place before tears. The pain of forgetting: spine. The pain of remembering: spine. All the times I have suddenly realized that my parents are dead, even now, it still surprises me, to exist in the world while that which made me has ceased to exist: my knees. ... To everything a season, to every time I've woken only to make the mistake of believing for a moment that someone was sleeping beside me: a haemorrhoid. Loneliness: there is no organ that can take it all.
 



Maybe the first time you saw her you were ten. She was standing in the sun scratching her legs. Or tracing letters in the dirt with a stick. Her hair was being pulled. Or she was pulling someone's hair. And a part of you was drawn to her, and a part of you resisted--wanting to ride off on your bicycle, kick a stone, remain uncomplicated. In the same breath you felt the strength of a man, and a self-pity that made you feel small and hurt. Part of you thought: Please don't look at me. If you don't, I can still turn away. And part of you thought: Look at me.




<b>Franz Kafka is Dead</b>

He died in a tree from which he wouldn't come down. ""Come down!"" they cried to him. ""Come down! Come down!"" Silence filled the night, and the night filled the silence, while they waited for Kafka to speak. ""I can't,"" he finally said, with a note of wistfulness. ""Why?"" they cried. Stars spilled across the black sky. ""Because then you'll stop asking for me."" The people whispered and nodded among themselves. They put their arms around each other, and touched their children's hair. They took off their hats and raised them to the small, sickly man with the ears of a strange animal, sitting in his black velvet suit in the dark tree. Then they turned and started for home under the canopy of leaves. Children were carried on their fathers' shoulders, sleepy from having been taken to see who wrote his books on pieces of bark he tore off the tree from which he refused to come down. In his delicate, beautiful, illegible handwriting. And they admired those books, and they admired his will and stamina. After all: who doesn't wish to make a spectacle of his loneliness? One by one families broke off with a good night and a squeeze of the hands, suddenly grateful for the company of neighbors. Doors closed to warm houses. Candles were lit in windows. Far off, in his perch in the trees , Kafka listened to it all: the rustle of the clothes being dropped to the floor, or lips fluttering along naked shoulders, beds creaking along the weight of tenderness. It all caught in the delicate pointed shells of his ears and rolled like pinballs through the great hall of his mind. 

That night a freezing wind blew in. When the children wake up, they went to the window and found the world encased in ice. One child, the smallest, shrieked out in delight and her cry tore through the silence and exploded the ice of a giant oak tree. The world shone. 

They found him frozen on the ground like a bird. It's said that when they put their ears to the shell of his ears, they could hear themselves. 




""Mom?"" I said. She turned. ""Can I talk to you about something?"" 
""Of course, darling. Come here."" 
I took a few steps into the room. There was so much I wanted to say. 
""I need you to be --"" I said, and then I started to cry. 
""Be what?"" she said, opening her arms. 
""Not sad,"" I said.




During the Age of Glass, everyone believed some part of him or her to be extremely fragile. For some it was a hand, for others a femur, yet others believed it was their noses that were made of glass. The Age of Glass followed the Stone Age as an evolutionary corrective, introducing into human relations a new sense of fragility that fostered compassion. This period lasted a relatively short time in the history of love-about a century-until a doctor named Ignacio da Silva hit on the treatment of inviting people to recline on a couch and giving them a bracing smack on the body part in question, proving to them the truth. The anatomical illusion that had seemed so real slowly disappeared and-like so much we no longer need but can't give up-became vestigial. But from time to time, for reasons that can't always be understood, it surfaces again, suggesting that the Age of Glass, like the Age of Silence, never entirely ended.






15. WHENEVER I WENT OUT TO PLAY, MY MOTHER WANTED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I WAS GOING TO BE 

When I'd come in, she'd call me into her bedroom, take me in her arms, and cover me with kisses. She'd stroke my hair and say, 'I love you so much,' and when I sneezed she'd say, 'Bless you, you know how much I love you, don't you?' and when I got up for a tissue she'd say, 'Let me get that for you I love you so much,' and when I looked for a pen to do my homework she'd say, 'Use mine, anything for you,' and when I had an itch on my leg she'd say, 'Is this the spot, let me hug you,' and when I said I was going up to my room she'd call after me, 'What can I do for you I love you so much,' and I always wanted to say, but never said: Love me less.






THE DEATH OF LEOPOLD GURSKY 
Leopold Gursky started dying on August 18, 1920. 
He died learning to walk. 
He died standing at the blackboard. 
And once, also, carrying a heavy tray. 
He died practicing a new way to sign his name. 
Opening a window. 
Washing his genitals in the bath. 
He died alone, because he was too embarrassed to phone anyone. 
Or he died thinking about Alma. 
Or when he chose not to.




THE DEATH OF ISAAC BABEL

Only after they charged him with the crime of silence did Babel discover how many kinds of silences existed. When he heard music he no longer listened to the notes, but the silences in between. When he read a book he gave himself over entirely to commas and semicolons, to the space after the period and before the capital letter of the next sentence. He discovered the places in a room where silence gathered; the folds of curtain drapes, the deep bowls of the family silver. When people spoke to him, he heard less and less of what they were saying, and more and more of what they were not. He learned to decipher the meaning of certain silences, which is like solving a tough case without any clues, with only intuition. And no one could accuse him of not being prolific in his chosen metier. Daily, he turned out whole epics of silence. In the beginning it had been difficult. Imagine the burden of keeping silent when your child asks you whether God exists, or the woman you love asks if you love her back . At first Babel longed for the use of just two words: Yes and No. But he knew that just to utter a single word would be to destroy the delicate fluency of silence.

Even after they arrested him and burned all of his manuscripts, which were all blank pages, he refused to speak. Not even a groan when they gave him a blow to the head, a boot tip in the groin. Only at the last possible moment, as he faced the firing squad, did the writer Babel suddenly sense the possibility of his error. As the rifles were pointed at his chest he wondered if what he had taken for the richness of silence was really the poverty of never being heard. He had thought the possibilities of human silence were endless. But as the bullets tore from the rifles, his body was riddled with the truth. And a small part of him laughed bitterly because, anyway, how could he have forgotten what he had always known: There's no match for the silence of God. </lj-cut>

Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.
In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.
Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid.
It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul."

In an effort to get people to look
into each other's eyes more, 
and also to appease the mutes, 
the government has decided
to allot each person exactly one hundred
and sixty-seven words, per day.

When the phone rings, I put it to my ear
without saying hello. In the restaurant
I point at chicken noodle soup.
I am adjusting well to the new way.

Late at night, I call my long distance lover, 
proudly say I only used fifty-nine today.
I saved the rest for you.

When she doesn't respond, 
I know she's used up all her words, 
so I slowly whisper I love you
thirty-two and a third times.
After that, we just sit on the line
and listen to each other breathe. 

---

&hearts; most people can write, but only a few can <i>really write.</i>

Just think: if all we had was 167 words a day, everything we'd say would be what really matters. People would write more. Politicians would be voted in based on what they could actually do, instead of how bombastic and inspiring their words sound. We'd spend more time thinking of what to say. Maybe we would argue less, because who wants to run out of words in the middle of an offensive? We'd curse less. Evolution would, perhaps, dictate that we develop the power of telepathy. There would be no movies, no tv shows, fewer songs, less singing; one-liners for newsreaders. We're be better at math, at least for addition up till 167."

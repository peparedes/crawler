"event","So this past weekend with my roommate in tow we decided to go to New York, however in the process we ended up going to ten different states...NC,VA,MD,NJ,DE,NY,MA,RI,CT,and PA to round it all out.  Who knew that I-95 South ran less than 5 miles off the border of PA, well my roommate being the amazing person that she is managed to navigate us to PA without any problem.  I bought the map months ago and finally looked at them after being lost trying to get to Boston, who knew.  It was awesome just the same, but I was so happy to be on the road back.  NYC and Boston are so not pretty no trees, drab buildings, scary people, and the cops don't like me, anywho that's another entry...I'm happy to be back though class awaits...ttyl"

"event","This was by far the best and most useful MLK day I have ever had I went to a program called ""move on up a little higher:sermons and songs"" at my school and it celebrated mlk and mahalia jackson and it was sooo awesome.  it was like you got to go to church and hear the two then later on you got to see these multicultural presentations from African and South American origin.  Then one of the school choirs decided to show off and it was awesome I had no clue they were good...holla at you Kori and Bianca.  I got to reconnect with my Aamp which means i now have a ride to see Barbershop 2 and can make some Greek Life connects(they have the best parties.)  Then Talib Kweli who originally came out with Mos Def came and started a discussion on race, religion, etc.  Most Importantly he preached activism it was soo refreshing to see a rapper who is conscientious and not talking about bitches, hoes, and diamonds.  He actually knew why people should not be rapping about those things and the fact that Africans are being killed for them.  It was just a great day then the person I like called it is truly awesome mega."

"event","Ok, so I'm watching the movie Seabiscuit for the second time...because the first time it put me to sleep....everything's cool til I realize how ridiculously made this movie truly is in comparison to the book...for any and all who might be trying to determine if its worthwhile to rent...it is but read the book instead...the intellectual stimulation will be much better than the brain damage resulting from watching an epic movie that isn't quite up the snuff...and Tobey Maguire is super short...I might even be able to look him straight in the eyes without heels that is sooo bad...That's my enlightening thought for the day, so think about it and read more...it's good for your brain."

"event","I sleep soundly
no worries
no thoughts at all

i'm woken 
i jump with a start
who, what, when , where?
dark, innocent brown eyes meet mine

they are my sisters
shyly she says ""Merry Christmas""
I remember then why?
Why I came home
Why I spent too much on gifts

For that moment
that moment that has occurred every christmas for 11 years
That moment when I take my sister's hand 
And we rip open her presents

Christmas may have lost its meaning on the whole
but in her youthful eyes
there is a santa claus
there are miracles
and she has the best big sister ever
What else do I need?
For that is the meaning of christmas"

What about the little things?"

"event","i am seriously not good at this whole posting thing.  I pretty much think for me i am a ""if i have something to say i will call and tell you""  but sometimes writing is needed.  Right now i want to go home, i want to curl up on my dorm bed with kel and kayla, watch ER and eat ice cream.  You know how sometimes you are just in the mood for a good cry??? not really like you have something urgent to cry about but you know that the venting of your feelings that have been all inside just feels almost energizing?? okay it might sound werid but that is how i feel.  

i miss things like, being in love, the joy of a volleyball match, a really good kiss, the fear of a really good scary movie, the feeling of being with close friends, even a good laugh.  Work is so mundane, so repetitive, so energy sucking!!!  I need new faces to meet, new people to chat with, new things to learn, just something to ""spice my life up"".  I feel so boring, so blah being here. There is nothing to do, besides work, come home try to work out, try to socialize with my parents so they dont get pissy, and then to bed.  I had fun going to the exorcist with Ricky, a good scary movie (that was fun) but its like i do that maybe once a month.  I don't know i am just wollowing, its a good wollowing day.  Its pouring (beautiful rain!!!) just makes me want to drive and get kel so we could play in the rain.  I want to feel energetic again, i want to be happy again.  Truth be told, no matter how beautiful camas is with its lakes, fields, rivers and trees i need my friends to be happy.  I am a people person and i need my people!!! hehehe PEOPLE COME BACK...i have my animals that is a plus...my catrs and pups make me smile.  Thats about it, i just need to go run or something.  Run to run away from my sorrows, run away from frustration and stress, run to feel good about myself and my body, run to relive these evil cramps!!!"

"event","k last night was a HUGE help to me....i dont know if it was valuable to them but to me it was so great just to have my girls back.  AND hello sex and the city baby!  that was sooooo great, its crazy how those episodes relate so much to us.  Right now we just finished season 3 and wow i can relate soooo much.  The love for the ex yet the love for the new.  But girls, i love you and we need to do that more often cause i love you and you are my friends for life.  I am happy now, my depressive mood has lifted like the clouds that drifted away and disapeared into the blue sky.  The weather represents my mood right now.  SUnny, uplifting and satisfied.  I woke up to my hunny bringing me coffee and a kiss, its sunny, i just had a night full of nails, hair, face masks, and sex and the city with my girls, i couldnt be happier right now...oh and i am watching ER!!!  

My congrats to josh for his preserverance and determination to make something for himself.  I am so proud of you and i wish you the best of luck.  I want everything for you, if i could i would give you the world.  You can do it!! i believe...

NOw this is the true ""precription for success"", study hard, have fantastic friends like mine who you can turn to for anything, a wonderful boyfriend, and a cheerful spirit, and a love for Christ....that is my medicine for happiness.  Thank you all!!! The crazy, cheerful, smily, spunky Kristen is back."

"event","k i cant handle this.  the tears can't hold back any longer.  i am sad, i am really depressed, i want to curl in a ball and be all alone.  I want my family back, like how it was first quarter, all us girls, together having fun.  I don't want this split, i dont want to have to choose.  I hate it, kelli is on one side and michaela is on the other.  I feel like i am going to lose them, especailly kelli cause she wants to exclude herself, from the group and that includes me.  I dont want to have to decide if i want to be with kel or my other friends....thats not fair why does it have to be like this.  I love michaela and i love kelli.  They are two of the closest friends i have ever had.  They are like my shaina, well my old best friend, that knew everything about me.  I could tell them anything.  I feel like michaela wont even talk to me about her feelings anymore.  Are you mad at me??? what did i do?  i want to cry, i want to scream, i am dieing inside.  this pain wont go away...i want to just go to sleep and awake up and it was all just a horrible nightmare.  I cant stand the shit that is going on, not only with my close friends but with mark's group.  no one cares, most of them just stick to each other seemingly afraid to come close to allow others to become close.  its all going on at the same time.  my brain wants to explode...i want to go in my room and cry alone.  I am annoyed at everything right now.  I hate feeling depressed...i have it but it gets so strong with the situation.  Why cant this go away.  God, i pray to you that you give me the strength to survive all of this and please help me keep kel and michaela as best friends, for they have no clue how much strength they have given me, through thick and thin, through the pains of my love for josh, and the fun times we have had.  This hurts, hurt that i cant even describe...its in my entire being, like a bad cancer that wells up inside me and just grows and grows, slowly attacking me, slowing trying to take my life.  Nothing seems to help, i dont know what to do.  i love all my friends and i want them to be happy, i dont want to be the median inbetween holding them together and that is all i really am.  The glue holding together the time bomb, thats awaiting to blow and rage in two separate pieces.  How do i make this pain go away?"

"event","Yeah michaela is back!!! hehehe late night talks are back, hehe.  I was so excited for her today...it is a week since she got confirmed and the first mass since.  There was no more waiting to join at the Lord's table, she is catholic, she is my sister in Christ forever and ever!!! Yeah that makes me happy.  I am so proud of you honey.  YOu will never be disappointed!  The Lord is strength, he is devotion, he is passion, and most of all...he is love.  Never fear, you are with him now, in the body of Christ.  Welcome to the Church.

Yeah you know what..i love mass.  There is just something so special, so peaceful, so calming that it just makes me feel so alive, to know that God has such a role and light within me.  He is my strength that i dont know how i could live without, oh wait i wouldnt.  Mass tonight was just like any other night but for some reason i felt something.  Something made me grab mark and hold him so tightly that i didnt want to let go.  We sat there kneeling together, praying, arm in arm heads together, and for that moment i could see something that could last for the rest of my days.  Scary in a way, that i wont really talk about it but i just want to get it out.  It felt so real, so alive, so God sent, to have him there beside me praying together.  I have always felt that in the chapel there is peace and serenity...but this time there was love, not only God's love me and mark as two individuals, but for us as a couple.  I looked to my right and michaela, danny, paul and heather were all there.  Nick Coffman, the guy i can never not smile at when i see him was there, being his ever-loving sprititual self; an inspiration at its best.  I was surrounded by family...not by blood but by our shared friendship, love, and given God passion for Him.  There was a blessing for families, and i squeezed mark's hand and said not only families but this family *pointing the our row of friends and the entire chapel* He just gave me a look of sincerity and love that i will never forget.  Times like this make me wonder why i ever get depressed, why i have to take medication to make me feel normal but you know what God made me who i am, and it's only natural to love the man who knows, cares, and loves me the most, my Lord.  I dont have to hate or question his reasonings for why i am clinically depressed for he has a plan for me to grow and learn under His care, i should not fear.  I would never ask to be depressed but i have it and i would not want to change it for that is a part of me now.  I need to love myself for who i am and who i will become, nothing more, nothing less.  

Love is the ever-powerful bond between beings.  The true and perfect bond, man-women-God.  I share my faith with my love Mark and that is truely a blessing for he is like a gift from God to me to help me through the times of tears of sadness and well as tears of joy.  I can't even expressed my prayers of gratitude for God for he has blessed me with so much that i feel i can never thank him enough for the gifts, talents, friends, and family (SU Family and blood).   Love to all"

Why is it that when times are tough you discover who your friends really are?  Cause seriously i give and give and give maybe that is me, but seriously its wearing when you dont get anything in return.  Its werid how life presents itself, always a lesson to learn, a challenge to tackle, and friend to win back.  

Friendship is like the breeze,
You can't hold it,
Smell it,
Taste it,
Or know when it's coming,
But you can always feel it,
And you'll always know it's there,
It may come and then go,
But you can know it'll always be back.
- Terri Fanning -

I just hope the people i am thinking about really do come back cause i am afraid they wont.  I always view myself as a person who people can come to, to have me listen, help, hang out, laugh with or at, whatever but someone seems to be avoiding that i dont know if its cause they dont see me as someone they can come to, if its cause they arent comfortable talking to me or what.  I just want everyone to know that you can come talk to me anytime, any time day or night, i am here.  Always will be.  For i know the meaning of a friend and i want everyone to share that with me, the art, the vision, the feeling of a true friend.

Who this is mainly aimed at...you should know who you are"

Yeah for him he has a interview today with the Costco Scholars and he might get put on some video thing for next years scholars.  Hehehe he is so cute, its very sexy the brain...haha!

"event","Why is it that when you try and try and try for someone...things get tough and fall apart.  Like in Indiana Jones, right when things are looking good is right when the floor follows out from under you.  Why is this?  Like when you try to help someone and then you break up and they go right back in the direction away from you.  For example, a guy who you were madly in love with for years decides to date someone the total opposite of you.  Maybe a stripper per say.  They loved you, you know that, but now its a question of ""Did you matter?"", "" Did you make any difference?"", ""Did you not teach anything of some meaning?"".  These are some of the things i ponder tonight because of a convo i had with my ex.  He is someone who is finally doing something that he can say he is proud of.  I am soo happy for him.  He is someone i always will love and care about and that is why i love knowing that he has found his love in a career, but then why do i feel sad?  I know why what am i saying i feel like, i will just be forgotten and not thought of as someone who cared.  Someone you give your all to is automatically on the ""hope to hear from"" list.  I want to be the one who calls/and gets calls on birthdays, christmas, easter, and just randomly.  For all who have seen my best friends wedding...i want to be jello.  In a way i want to be the girl---friend that all girlfriends are scared of cause i know a lot about their man.  I want to be there to hold his kids, to go out with his girl, i guess i just dont want to be writen off, like a nobody.  

Yeah thats it

ps.  i love you mark, i couldnt do this without you standing by me...

remember i am trying...and that someday i will trust again and that i can give you my all."

"event","Ok, why did God give the ability to love such little furry animals.  For example, i dont know what it is but i can be sooo upset, crying hysterically and my puppies rush in and attack me, licking my face and nothing seems to be wrong.  I just woke up to the sun shinning, my cat next to me, and my wiggling labs and the memory of crying last night is flushed away.  Why is life so simple and yet so conplicated at the same time.  Why is there such evil in the world bound up in a couple of men that were hurt me and yet there is such love in men like mark, my father and my dogs morgan and starbuck.  They just make me smile.  I took the dogs to the park today and just walked around this 58 acre field just smiling because i have them, two simple little animals running around, panting like mad, and then mark...someone who loves me just for me.  
It just puzzles me how much love and hate there is in the world.  Why, who knows?  Only to have faith in God can one understand and accept.  I am making a pledge to all who know me and know what i have gone through in the past, that i am placing past in the past.  I am not going to wake up with nightmares, i am not going to cry hysterically cause i have flash back of that one horrible night.  I am done.  I want to love Mark, and i cant do that fully with my sadness of my own past.  Mark, I love you and i am going to do this....but i can oly do it with the support you of friends."

"event","its crazy how much you miss something once its gone.  I played volleyball for 8 years, basically all year around (school and club ball) and now with mark playing all the time telling me about it i cant stop playing with my setting ball.  This question is my shoulder strong enough to play again?  Who knows?!  i seriuosly i want to try out next year for the Redhawks...but then my ""am i good enough"" attitude kicks in.  I dont know all i need to is play with my honey and work out.  The love for the game never dies, just like love.  

Acutally i see volleyball as my first true love.  Oh come on, its not that werid.  I started playing volleyball again the ""koodie infected boys"" in the 4th grade during recess.  Then i started to noticed that i could win, so i challenged my girlfriends to get a team together and we could play against the boys.  That drove my challenge loving personally to arise.  And here i am to this day...dreaming of volleyball.  Its like a love, the love for the game... I miss it...Mark we are sooooo playing when we get back.

Set work-outs and if we can get a net up we can working on hitting.  I need to ease into that and work out my shoulder gently.  Kisses to all."

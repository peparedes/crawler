"event","Okay, so I know I've been gone for a while, but that's because I keep getting myself grounded. I mean, yeah, of course it's gonna happen if all I do is stay home. Why? Three conditions:

1) No friends
2) No money
3) No life...

I've got a job now so I'm working on that no money thing. But the other two...kinda hard to fix. Ever since I left Cathedral, my life went further down the tubes. And I've tried, but I can't find a way to get it back. 

And worst of all, I've been feeling lonely...a lot. I'm back to crying myself to sleep at night or not even sleeping at all because all I can do is think. I've let myself go, and it's like it wouldn't make a difference whether I were dead or not."

"event","Alright, well maybe I did write something in my other journal, but it wasn't much of an update. Actually, my life is pretty much the same as always. Nothing new is going on. Well, except for the fact that I have a new obsession and...and...that's basically it! See? Nothing new!

My mom is being a total bitch about everything. It feels like I'm going to be stuck at home for FOREVER! I haven't gone out in weeks, and the Prozac is actually working. I really wish I could go SOMEWHERE. Blah!

Hmm...I update and complain. Ah well! I can't wait for tomorrow! A new episode of Charmed...wo0t!

Hopefully, this whole paranormal team will start off soon. I'm practically desperate about it and excited.

Oo, I've also begun writing a story entitled ""The Eight Gates of Hell: The Legend of Spider Gates Cemetery"". It sucks right now, but after a few drafts and such, it might be good.

Mmkay, well, I gotta go before I get caught online. Toodles!"

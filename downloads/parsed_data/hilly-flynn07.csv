"event","This morning upon arriving at work I checked my email, as I always do.  Awaiting me was an email from the facebook informing me that I'd been invited to join a group called ""The cheburashka fan club"" (for those of you who don't know, cheburashka is a Russian cartoon character with whom J-tard was, and remains, obsessed).  Oh, fuck, I think, and go check it out.  Sure enough, it is a group begun by Jon of the horrendous b.o.  Now, a little backstory:  two days ago, he invited me to join another group he'd started called ""the awfulness of Russian grammar"" or something.  I accepted because I'm a fucking pussy and didn't have it in me to decline.  Now, the question is:  Do I have the balls to decline this one?  I've left the invite unanswered to build up my courage, but at the moment all signs point to one answer--yes, Virginia, I do have balls.

Words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated."

Thank you to everyone who wrote lovely things on my facebook wall or sent me lovely emails for my birthday.  It seems that everyone can't wait to see me, and it's nice to feel so loved.

Tonight Billy and I go on our great birthday adventure, all the way to Ellsworth (big city--sort of).  It's the first time we've really gone away together and I can't wait.

Things that are not so happy:
Jtard added me as a friend on the facebook, and because I'm a bleeding heart I confirmed him.  So don't ever say I'm not a nice person.

Despite vacuuming, flea bombing, spraying, and washing and powdering the cats, Billy's house has been infested with fleas for the past three weeks or so.  If you've never been through this before, it's the worst experience ever and a really good incentive to keep your pets indoors.  If Billy had someplace else to live, we would just burn the house down and be done with it.  That'd show the little fuckers."

The streets were clean, the people were friendly, I got to see my Sarah whom I missed terribly, and in general it was wonderful.  Then I had to come back here, and was greeted almost immediately by a four foot stream of vomit on the metro.  Welcome back.

Today I had to go to class, which as usual was horrific.  Particularly razgovor, when Jon did his presentation on ""my dream of writing suckass musicals about banks.""  I'm not kidding.  Want to know my dream, Jon?  Murdering you with a switchblade.  Go write a musical about that.  

On the bright side, since being here I've become much more comfortable with anger than happiness, so it's probably just as well we weren't in Berlin too long.  I might have self-destructed."

"event","Tonight Kim and I went to see Swan Lake.  The ballet: wonderful.  The people behind us: not so much.  Leave it to us to get seats right in front of two loud, obnoxious, very very American frat boys.  Let's check off the Americanisms, shall we?
--tried to discuss the quality of the ballet, even though they obviously couldn't have differentiated between a good ballet and a mediocre one to save their lives.
--once they realized that they were getting nowhere discussing the quality of the ballet, resorted to doing what they do best: rating the attractiveness of the dancers.
--were, quote, ""disturbed"" by the male dancers.
--spent one entire intermission discussing first whether Canadian girls were ""cute"" or ""hot,"" then whether there was any such thing as a cute blonde Jewish girl, and finally coming to the conclusion that girls with dirty blonde hair were cute, while girls with dyed blonde hair were hot.
--bought beer--AT THE BALLET, mind you--and spent a good portion of one of the intermissions contemplating which was better, Russian or American beer.

In addition, we of course ended up right in front of them in the ""line"" (basically, a crush of people all trying to get to the front) at the coat check.  And as if the above list weren't bad enough, one of them spit on me while having some inane conversation with his friend.  Fortunately, I got the perfect opportunity a few minutes later and shoved him out of the way so Kim and I got our coats first.  I win at Russia.  I've finally been here long enough to lose all notions of politeness and common courtesy.

In conclusion, no wonder people hate Americans so much."

Until he got to one babushka (with gold teeth, no less) whose card had expired (or something--I didn't catch all of it).  In any case, it was invalid.  So, after arguing for a good 5 minutes, she had to pay the 100 ruble fine.  Oh, it was marvelous.  I love watching the babushki get put in their place.  Especially the ones with gold teeth.

In other news, I can't wait until the end of March when Kim and I go to Berlin.  I wish we were leaving tomorrow.  Every day it takes all of my self-control not to start packing.

Obligatory anti-Jon rant:
On Tuesday we had to buy Jon presents for Men's Day.  I bought him pencils and made up some gibberish about how it was because he writes music so he probably needed a lot of pencils.  Not only did he thank me profusely in class, he thanked me again later.  You absolute tool.  If you only knew how little thought (and how much hatred) went into that present...and I'm not sleeping with you.  No matter how many times you thank me for the stupid pencils.  You smell bad."

"event","In the interests of determining whether or not I'm happy about being here for another semester, I've decided to compile lists of what I will and won't miss.

What I'm going to miss about Russia:
--Marina Nikolaevna
--Olga Vladimirovna
--blini
--ice cream
--$5 theatre, opera, and ballet tickets
--always having something to do
--seeing at least a dozen pretty buildings every day
--finding something new to giggle about every half hour
--being able to use Russlish
--Kim  

What I'm not going to miss about Russia:
--Jon
--being afraid of men/the police/gypsies/everyone
--getting up before the sun comes out
--feeling guilty if I just want to sit at home for an evening
--the metro
--Jon
--eating so much at every meal that I feel like my stomach's going to explode
--couples stopping in the middle of the sidewalk to make out 
--Jon
--not having internet in my room (or at least my house)
--is Jon on here yet?

So, all in all, I think I'm glad I'm staying.  Because the postitives by far outweigh the negatives.  Although, as Kim said, ""If Jon was in a car accident over break and couldn't come back, I wouldn't be sad.""  I know that's terrible, but I can't help it.  He keeps following us around and looking at me.  And he smells.  And we've come to the conclusion that it's me he's in love with.  This is based on the fact that he's gone on every single excursion I've gone on.  Why?  Why do the losers always fall in love with me?  I mean, if I was nice to everyone I'd understand.  But I'm not even nice to the people I do like.  So what the hell?"

*In mass media today, we were watching a movie.  At some point, there was an orchestra playing music.  It starts, and Jon begins tapping his foot, humming, and CONDUCTING WITH HIS PEN.  Why?  Because he's an asshole, that's why.

*As usual, while we're watching the movie he laughs at things that aren't funny, converses with the characters, and continually looks to Kim and me for approval of his idiocy.  I don't know why, because said approval is never forthcoming.  We don't even give him disapproving looks.  We just ignore him.  And yet he continues to look.  MAKE IT STOP.

*He keeps following us around and standing much closer than necessary.

*Today in conversation class he was talking about how he doesn't like dogs because his neighbors at home have two dogs who like everyone except him.  Of course they don't like you, I'm thinking as he tells this, you're obnoxious.  With his eyebrows and fish eyes and uneven lips...

*He keeps saying ""classna,"" which is my favorite Russian word.  It's pretty untranslateable, but Kim and I have decided it means ""fucking awesome.""  It's the perfect word for any situation that makes you happy.  Free theatre tickets?  Classna.  Pretty dress?  Classna.  Good sex?  Classna.  And he won't stop using it.  That is MY WORD, dammit! 

To conclude: One of these days I'm going to look him in the face and tell him that if he doesn't stop looking at me all the time, I'm going to throw him under a tram.  I'm not kidding."

"event","Last night Kim and I went to see La Boheme at the Mariinsky.  The opera itself was wonderful.  Our new best friend at the teatralnaya kassa sold us tickets that were dead center in the front row of the balcony.  Unfortunately, when we got there we found two babushki sitting in our seats.  However, since we were under the impression that they'd had the two seats next to us and had simply switched, we chose not to argue.  This turned out to be a bad decision, when a few minutes later the people who actually had the seats next to us showed up.
Them: ""You're in our seats.""
Us: ""They're in our seats.  See, we have tickets.""
Babushki: ""We have tickets too!""
At this point someone went to get an usher.  She came and asked to see our tickets.  We obliged.  She asked to see the babushkis' tickets, and it turned out that when they said they had tickets, what they actually meant was that they didn't have tickets at all.  Or rather, they had entry tickets, which don't have assigned seats.  To this the usher responded, ""On a tram you sit in any free space, here we all buy tickets!""  I wanted to tell her she was my hero, but by the time I'd formulated the sentence and checked the grammar, she was off on her next babushka-ejecting adventure.  And the babushki shuffled off, presumably to try to steal someone else's seat.  Now, I can't fault them for using entry tickets, since I have myself done so.  But when I did it and the seat's rightful owner showed up, I immediately left the seat.  I didn't try to bullshit my way into it.

The opera, as I said, was fantastic.  Afterwards, we went outside to try and figure out how to get home.  This was when the real adventure began.  First, we got on the number 27, which we new went to the metro station.  That is, we got on a bus labeled number 27.  But as we were getting on, we heard some old woman getting off and saying ""Well why does it say 27?""  After my experience with the falsely labeled number 5 trolleybus, we weren't taking any chances, and got off.  To get to the theatre, we'd taken the number 306 mashrutka (another bus-type conveyance).  After a bit of discussion, we decided that those, unlike regular buses, have a circular route, so if we get on it we'll get back to Nevsky eventually.  So, after waiting for about 15 minutes, one comes and we get on it.  After riding around for a good hour or so, we realize we are the only ones left on the bus.  At this point we begin to get a little nervous, thinking maybe the mashrutki don't have circular routes, after all.  So Kim plucks up her courage and asks the driver.
Kim: Do you go to Nevsky?
Driver: No, that's the other side.  You should have asked when you got on.
Yeah, thanks. 
So, we ask him if he can take us to any metro station.  Fortunately, instead of being angry, stopping, and kicking us off, he takes pity on the stupid Americans and brings us to the nearest metro.  We gave him a 30 ruble tip.  That's probably as much as he makes in a month.  Moral of the story: Don't assume you know how transportation works, especially if it's a mode of transportation you've never used before.  And ESPECIALLY if you're in Russia, where even the fact that it's always worked before is no guarantee that it will work this time."

*Kim and I went shopping and I bought a super adorable skirt for like $2.50, and a really hot top, which I am wearing to the ballet tonight.  We also got some kind of a frequent buyers card for the Italian underwear store on Sadovaya, where they have amazing underwear for completely reasonable prices.

*I managed to finish all of my homework last night, and start reading the book my tutor gave me.  And while reading, I only had to look up about 2 words a page to understand what was going on.  I'm amazing.

*This morning at 8:00 my cell phone rang.  At first I was very confused.  It was still dark out, so it could have been anywhere between 2 and 9.  I found my clock and saw that it was 8.  I got out of bed to find my phone, meanwhile trying to figure out who the hell would be calling me at 8:00 on a Sunday morning.  I found my phone.  Private number.  I considered not answering.  Fortunately, I remebered how to say ""you have the wrong number,"" and I decided to be brave and answer.  And who should it be but my Victoria, drunk dialing me internationally to ask me what babushka means.  I feel loved.

*This morning we had bliny again.

*Tonight I get to go to the ballet.  And not only that, but I look awesome.

Conclusion:  Kim and I may have lost hard core at Russia every other week we've been here, but this week we totally won."

"event","*On Wednesday, Rachel and I went to rinok (I'm not sure if that's the proper transliteration, but whatever) to buy gloves.  I wanted pretty gloves to wear to the theatre, and she wanted gloves that actually kept her hands warm.  We looked around without success for awhile and then finally found a store that seemed to have everything we ever wanted.  The catch: when Rachel asked about a pair, we were informed that you had to buy them in tens.  Not ten of one pair, of course, that would be silly--you could buy ten different pairs.  We stayed just long enough to make sure we understood what they were saying, and then left for someplace where we could just buy one pair at a time.

*Also on Wednesday: my tutor and I went to a concert.  As we were heading toward the kassa to buy tickets, a woman approached us.
Woman: do you want to go to the concert?
Us: yes.
Woman: come to this door at 6:45 and give my name to the security guard, and I'll get you really cheap tickets to really good seats.  (There was more than that, but that's the gist of it). 
So, at 6:45 we enter through the door she indicated, say ""Svetlana Vassilyevna"" to the security guard, get let in, and see her.  She's an usher.  We check our coats, she gives us our tickets, and we enter through the special backstage door.  We actually see the quartet having their pictures taken backstage.  What we have are called ""entry tickets"" which means we don't have assigned seats, we either find some or sit on the unassigned couches.  So, after trying a couple of seats and being ejected by the rightful owners, we find seats in the 10th row and manage to hold on to them.  The concert itself was fantastic, and what was even more fantastic was seeing the ticket of the person next to us and finding out we were in 1200 ruble seats (about $45).  What did we pay?  200 rubles ($8).  After the concert we got our coats, paid Svetlana Vassilyevna, and she gave my tutor her number and said to call any time we want to see anything.  She also asked me to take a letter to mail to her son in New York when I go home in December.  I'm pretty sure what happened is that she gets a certain number of free tickets for working there, so she sells them and pockets the money.  In other words, I bribed an usher.  Why do I think this?  Because she was very concerned that we be discreet when paying her.  Also, it makes me feel really badass to think that I bribed someone.

*While at the concert we saw someone in a see-through shirt.  Literally.  It was lace and I could clearly see her bra through it.  She was not attractive.  It was not attractive.  I do not understand.

*I have a raging crush on Sasha, the lighting designer I work with at the theatre.

*I hate Jon.  He makes me want to die.  If he doesn't stop following Kim and me around and not only listening to our conversation, but laughin and interjecting meaningless sounds as though he's actually part of the conversation, I'm going to kill him.  I am not kidding."

"event","Yesterday was big day in the history of my time in Russia.  I actually enjoyed doing fucking Valentina's homework (side note--I wonder how long it'll take the second semester only kids to figure out the ""fucking Valentina"" is two words).  The assignment was to write an essay on the American Constitution.  So I went on for a half page about why I have wet dreams about the bill of rights.  Awesome.  However, Valentina is still an asshole.  Shockingly, she must have been married at some point, because today in class she was talking about her daughter.  You know what that means.  Blech.

Not such a high point: Today during break I was sitting by the bulletin board talking to Kim (in English, because we are bad people), when a few people came over to read the announcements.  One of them, unfortunately, was Jon.  So not only did I have to smell him during my conversation, at some point when Kim and I stopped talking I turned my head to look out the window and Jon's face was literally 3 centimeters from mine.  There are neither words nor sounds to express my disgust.  I almost fell off my seat.  He's an asshole too.  A smelly one."

"event","Yesterday, Kim and I were walking through the mall while hungry (mistake number 1).  We passed a Chinese food place that had really beautiful chairs, and decided to go there (mistake number 2).  Seriously, the chairs were amazing.  I paid 120 rubles for some kind of cold noodley thing and 5 bread balls filled with a sickeningly sweet bean paste.  And when I say sickeningly sweet, keep in mind that this is coming from the girl who eats sugar cubes straight.  10 minutes after finishing, we both began to feel sleepy and ill (thanks, stupid Russia with your lack of and FDA and your MSG ridden food).  Today, over 24 hours later, I still feel as though I have a bowling ball in my tummy.  120 rubles.  That's happy hour sushi with change left over.  Bastards.

However, TODAY Kim and I managed to rock the teatralnaya kassa not once but twice, and buy tickets to both La Boheme and Cinderella (the ballet).  I know you're all thinking, yeah, good job, and I dressed myself this morning, but remember that we did this all in Russian.  In Russian, you have to decline the name of what you want to say.  It was terrifying.  It's a good thing I didn't have to pee, or I would have peed my pants.  But the lady was really nice, and even helped buy cheap, but good, seats.  We're using it as an excuse to go shopping Saturday and buy theatre clothes.  As if I don't already have 10 skirts and 2 dresses with me.  Russia + bank account = poor house.

High point of the day:
After Julia finished her presentation on American football, which was basically like ""we dress up, and drink, and oh yeah, I think there's a game at some point or something.  Then we drink more,"" Olga (my favorite teacher.  She is my girlfriend) said ""So you drink all day, then have 4 hours of football, then drink some more?"" On receiving confirmation, she continued ""And who said that Russians are alcoholics?""  I almost died.  It was a lot funnier and cuter when she did it."

"event","Yesterday Kim and I (who is not my girlfriend, no matter how many of my posts start with that sentence) went to the supermarket to buy Alpen Gold, because her mother thinks she's getting migraines because of Alpen Gold withdrawal.  As we were surveying the chocolate selection, we glimpsed the ESL mistake to end all ESL mistakes--""milk chocolate with huzelnuts.""  They meant, of course, hazelnuts.  This particular typo lent itself to all manner of fun statements:
""Rumor has it huzelnuts are better than sex.""
""Why eat hazelnuts when you can eat huzelnuts?""
""Do I have huzelnut on my mouth?""
Me: ""You're spelling it wrong! There's only one z!""
Kim: ""I didn't know there was a correct spelling for huzelnuts, you asshole.""
And my favorite, which came after seeing a naked manaquin holding skis in a store window:
Me: ""You can't ski naked.""
Kim: ""Sure you can, he does it all the time.""
Me: ""I don't buy it!  He'd freeze his huzelnuts off!""
And I know it looks like it's pronounced ""hyuzlenuts"" but it's actually pronounced ""huzzlenuts.""  Don't ask why.  It's best not to delve too deeply into the mystery of the huzelnut.

Last night after the huzelnut adventure I went to see a Russian ska band with Rachel, Katy, and Kathleen.  They sang a song about herring.  It was fun.

This morning I finally triumphed over and ATM.  The problem with ATMs here is that if you take out 1000 ruble or more, they give it to you in 1000 ruble bills which no one will break.  But I know how to trick them.  Today I just took out 2 withdrawals of 400 rubles, and one of 200 rubles, giving me 1000 rubles (about $35) in 100 ruble bills, which I can use anywhere.  I win.  Also, I got to laugh because when it dispensed my cash the machine told me to ""Pleace take your money."""

"event","Today I decided that it was necessary to start some sort of blog/livejournal/etc in order to share with the world the multiple ways in which I fail at Russia.  Granted, sometimes I do win, but those times are rare.  

Today's failure has its roots last week, when I got asked to help with lighting for a dance festival.  Mistake number 1: I said yes.  As a result, Kim and I had to change our sleepover date from Friday night to Thursday night.  Which meant that we didn't get to sushi happy hour until 4:30, and consequently there was no room for us.  We returned to her house and ate ramen noodles.  Ramen noodles are not sushi.  However, the 90 ruble Quentin Tarantino collection, which turned out to be of fantasic quality, made up somewhat for the sushi debachle.

Then, today, at about 3:15, as I am walking to the theatre for this supposed dance festival, I get a text message saying that they found someone else to help with the lights, but if I want I can still go and see if they need help.  My immediate thought is ""screw that!""  Instead, I call Kim and we decide to go to a movie.  We arrive at the movie theatre at about 10 past 4 and try to buy tickets to a 4:50 showing of Wallace and Grommit.  They are sold out.  How any movie could possibly be sold out 40 minutes before the showtime is beyond me.  Worse still, this happened after we bought candy to smuggle into the theatre.  In short, Russia hates us.  

On the bright side, yesterday while watching ""Kill Bill"" we learned how to say ""on the other hand"" and the verb for ""to fuck.""  These are important.  We tried to get ""asshole"" as well, but didn't quite catch it.  In general, we lose today.  But maybe tomorrow, when we go DVD shopping, we will win, especially now that we've found a store were you can get good quality DVDs for $3.  So maybe Russia isn't so bad after all.  If only the cheap movie theatre wasn't evil."

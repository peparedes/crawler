"event","After of these years (13 to be exact)I got to see Morrissey live in concert.  It was a pretty close call I almost did not even get tickets but luckily craigslist came through for me and I did not even end up spending too much cash on it either.

He played here at the Aragon Ballroom which I guess is one of his favorite venues. The whole experience was everything that I had hoped that it would be.  He looked handsome as ever and sounded beautiful. My heart stopped when I saw him as he walked aout onto the stage and then I heard the words, ""Panic on the streets of London..."" 

He played a lot of smiths songs, I think it was about 7 actually. Such as "" William it was really nothing"" and ""Please, Please, Please"", those are songs that I never though I would even get to hear live in my lifetime and I am extremely thankful that I did.

Of course now I just want to see him more and more and I like to believe that I will.


Things here in Chicago are going great. I am loving my job and moving up pretty fast.
On another good note I am moving into MY OWN PLACE, very soon! Man I have to say I deserve that one.

Yes, I am happy and just working hard....
here are some recent pics too...

i really hope that when i get settled in chicago she will come and we can shake things up a bit together.

i am heading down to the florida keys for a little getaway, i asked robert if he could possibly make a cameo, perhaps he will. i always wondered what it would be like to see him again. many thoughts ran through my mind and of course i got that achy feeling in my stomach which of course i just got really drunk to try to hide my feelings because for any of you that know me well enough know that i keep a wall up around myself and it usually is very hard to get through.

"event","at 6:30 i will be departing from oakland airport and heading on my journey back to the east coast.
so what kind of trouble have i been getting into...

it all started almost exactly a year ago, i stopped going to school, my relationship was completely dead.
so i naturally wanted to escape it all. i was going out almost every night of the week, days would overlap, sometimes two at a time.
obviously i was not just drinking at this point, cocaine was my poision and i sure enjoyed it.

at first it was just a few lines here and there with friends but soon it was me tracking down my dealer and needing to make sure i would get it before i even reached the club i was heading to or at least meeting me at my destination.

then the after parties came more and more, the lines would be flowing through the rooms on our scratched up cd cases.

my life was pretty much taking over by it but that slowly started to not be enough for me anymore to numb what i was feeling inside.
then i learned, oh so you can inject it?

i remember the first time like watching it on the silver screen, leaving the after party in the early morning hours with my dear friend who is just as lost as i am. we were dressed to the nine as we walked through the streets of san francisco down to the tenderloin (the dirty nieghborhood filled with all the junkies) of course it did not take us long to score some needles and at that point we were in a cab back up to my upper haight apartment.

my heart and stomach were filled with anxiety. we get to the apartment, i learn to set up my first shot and then it went.
as i slowly went into my arm i could feel it rushing through my viens. the rush took over my body as i walked into the living room.
i rememeber being so warm i immeadiately took my shirt off and layed in a doped up daze of euphoria.

through the morning and into the late evening i kept on going, ther excitement and feeling is undescribable.

this is when it all started, when i really lost control of my life.
it began as just maybe once a week or so then went on to every couple days which lead to evervyday.
of course i eventually stopped going to work, drained the small amount of money i did have saved in the bank.

i did that for about 6 months then in december i just looked at myself and could not see myself anymore, i had lost so much weight from barely eating, i pretty much just looked like any other junkie.

which was just what i had become.

so i took myself on a plane to florida to detox and clean up.

this is the start of many more chapters but it was not completely over.

"event","well everyone,

my decision has been made, i will be leaving san francisco on sunday. i know i have said i was leaving in the past but this time i am definately departing.

i pretty much feel like i have taken all from here that i can, i just really want to go back to school without having to worry about bills etc. so i am going to be back in florida until june then iu am going to go live with my cousin in pittsburgh and attend art school there.

i will not have to worry about rent or anything so that i can accomplish my goals.

this was a very hard choice because i love so many people here and i will miss my dj gigs but hey pittsburgh is not the most exciting city so maybe i can shake things up there! i am sure they need a fresh face from sf to show them some style! haha

so i will plan a going away/birthday party so that i can say goodbye correctly!

i know this is very sudden but i just really need to get out the city.
i just can't handle the couch surfing any longer, i can't handle not knowing each day where i am going to sleep anymore.

i want more planning for a last hoorah! and what not but i think that right now i just need to worry about myself and well being.

i have lived on my own since i was 17 and i just really need a break and stability right now more than anything!"

i styaed in hollywood, spent most of my time in west hollywood.
i loved shopping on the strip, i got some great new things.

the show at fubar was great minus the fact that i was about 110 degrees in LA.
met some cute boys, got some numbers.

after the show at fubar we ended up at an after party at James St. James's place, it was pretty much like a club except you did not have to pay for drinks, just tip and plus you could smoke inside, it was great.

i will definately be making regular trips to LA from now on, also i spotted a location where one of my favorite new Morrissey pics was taken at, it was the football field of hollywood high, i wanted to roll around on the ground, maybe next time i will run into him and then we will finally get married.

"event","june was a crazy month, with the pride stage and shows etc!

but a damn good one at that.

this year playing at the shadowplay stage was great, i had an amazing time. being out during the day like that and being drunk with all your friends is quite an experience. the hotness of boys was everywhere, i wanted to make out with all of them, my goal was 10 and instead i got 16. it was fun.

after the stage we headed off to juanita more's party ""lashes"" which was at the phoenix hotel, its pretty much like walking into a hollywood hotel, big pool, palm trees, tiki style bars.
everyone had rooms and people were just everywhere! but i can write a book about that day.

other than that i have been working like crazy, i am headed off to LA this weekend for Trannyshack in LA.
Me and Jarrad (supositori spelling) and foxy are all renting a car together. i think it will be quite a time.

sort of like an all star SF show, we are gonna take over the city of angels! watch out.

but, 2 weeks ago i got to have my performance debut at trannyshack (not in drag just as myself)

my drag sister duo, miss edie modular and miss. loveless had me in there number, i was a boy that was sleeping with both of them but in the song they realize it and beat my down where i then crawled off the stage!

it was so fun, sadly there seem to be no pics from the event! i had fun with those bitches though, of course they almost ate me cause they were so hungry afterward, they both kind of eat too much!

i am also going to be performing with them on the 11th at harveys!

"event","so tonight i returned to trannyshack. i usually dont go out alone but i did.
i totally needed it.

i ended up getting some really great reassurances that i am not even gonna explain because it will make me look bad.

it didnt work out that well in the end but i think that something else may come of it.

i will explain more later.

i am fucking drunk....

i am alone....

always alone, me and only me.

sometimes i feel like the walls are all caving in on me, sometimes i feel like i wish it would all just go away.

i am fucking trapped...stuck...nothing to lose and nowhere to go.

i am homesick but i dont know where home is.

for i am almost 24 and what the fuck have i done?!"

"event","so last night i went to a fancy little cocktail/dinner party at vals place in oakland!
it was so great, tons of alcholol and food with great friends.

i was drinking appletinis!

so then at the spur of the moment we all ended up goin to michaels new party at the DNA lounge, ""pop rocks""
it was so much more fun then we had expected.
great music, we danced for like 3 hours.

man so fun.

totally a perfect night, i dont get to say that much."

"event","so this week was pretty low key for me, i didn't really do much of anything.

i went to club 6 on monday for the interpol afterparty, it was a huge let down. the place was strange, the music was ok, but the sound was horrible. naturally it was all a little bit too sceny for my liking, which i knew.

carlos d was spinning, he was nice to look at for a few minutes.

i did get to see the lovemakers play, they are really good.

besides that i am just trying to get things ready to move on out of here, i am taking a temporary job to get some extra cash cause i am running very very short of funds, but i think that all will be ok!

getting to chicago is just totally fucking stressful!

i will be getting there just a bit shy of my 24th birthday though.

so friday, i went to the hush hush for a few pitchers of beer, i went with val and then we met up with a bunch of people which then we took off for re-flexx at the cherry bar, it was a bit slow but still great music and lots of dancing, overall very fun.

i will say, i was TRASHED! but in a good way.

i do have great friends. : )

me and the grrls, just being us...

i am sure in just 2 weeks or so i will be gone.

i am so excited to move back to chicago but i will miss somethings about this place even though i complain about it a lot.
its definately never going to be my home though like chicago is.

i will be going to new wave city this saturday to support my friends so maybe i will see some of you then,

its so nice to look at, i miss that sound, its so relaxing to me.

i have been having so much fun, been spending so much time just going out with friends and what not.
staying out until like 5am everynight.

today jena comes into town, i am so curious to see her reaction to the snow.
tonight i really think that i may lay low but, there is a rock/indy/80s night at the smart bar that i may have to check out!

me and kristina are going to get some laundry done today which is much needed.

i should get to that now, i hope everyone is enjoying there new year!

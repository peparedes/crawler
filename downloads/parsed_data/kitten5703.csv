"event","That was literally the best concert I have ever been to.&nbsp;Idina&nbsp;is freaking awesome! She sang two songs from Wicked and No Day But Today from Rent! It was so fabulous, And then Mary and I waited outside for like, an hour and&nbsp;a half after the concert in the hopes of getting pics, autographs etc. And she came out and did some but the rude ass people who are like RABID Idina fans completely ignored her security guys who were telling us to get in a line and all rushed in a big group to the front&nbsp;and THEY all got pics and sigs and we got&nbsp;nothing. I almost&nbsp;kicked someone's ass, and&nbsp;I'm pretty&nbsp;much passive-agressive.&nbsp;But I did get to touch her shoulder and I was almost face to face with her. She is&nbsp;so gorgeous in person. :) :) :)&nbsp;

And more good news! We got our test results back on Corey's lil&nbsp;""guys"" and there is nothing wrong with him! We can conceive naturally! Well,&nbsp;we're stilll doing the IVF but we dont need a donor! :) :) :) :)

What a great few days. :)&nbsp;"

Maybe I should correct that....you know how, when you sit on your foot and it falls asleep and you touch it and it feels all weird, like, you KNOW you're touching it but it doesnt feel like it? My leg has been like that. When I shave my leg, it's weird, like I KNOW I'm shaving it, but it feels asleep. Its only 1 leg. From below knee to above ankle. Weird, huh? I can feel my hypchodiacism setting in....maybe it's a sign of cancer, or worse! Ahhh.....damn WebMD doesnt have ANY help! I could be dying,...</p>"

"event","&nbsp;Well Mary was a lass
From the lower class 
She was an Irish emigree 
When she arrived in New York 
In a kitchen she found work 
Cooking meals in the Bowery 

In that kitchen Mary baked 
and never took a break 
and the people wolfed it down 
But bellies growled 
more than they should 
From eating all they could 
'Til they were buried in the ground 

Oh Mary, Typhoid Mary 
Your kitchen wasn't clean 
The dead are dead I reckon 
because they asked for seconds 
Your kitchen wasn't clean 

The city was scared 
And began to despair 
Where could this plague 
come from so crude? 
And the cops began to wonder 
Why all those gone asunder 
had eaten Mary Mallon's food 

So like a crook she was sought 
and Mary was caught 
The charge she did not understand 
Her stools were tested 
And Mary was arrested 
If only she'd washed her hands 

Oh Mary, Typhoid Mary 
Your kitchen wasn't clean 
The dead are dead I reckon 
because they asked for seconds 
Your kitchen wasn't clean 

In the hands of the state 
she died in thirty eight 
The advice her survivors left - 
If a meal makes you faint 
Then make a complaint 
And ask to see the chef

Oh Mary, Typhoid Mary 
Your kitchen wasn't clean 
The dead are dead I reckon 
because they asked for seconds 
Your kitchen wasn't clean"

One step forward ten steps back its too much for my brain 
Seven days of misery will start to get you down 
It seems I have a barrel full of sorrows I should drown 

Hey, hey, why can't things just go my way? 
I'm sick and tired of dealing with this shit. 
Hey, hey, its just another lousy day 
I think I'll sit and drink here for a bit, just for a bit. 

I know it can't be all that bad there are some days it ain't 
But then a bad one comes along &amp; I start to chew the paint 
A stronger man could handle it I know that isn't me 
There could be good things all around I too pissed off to see&nbsp;

Things are getting better, I'm learning not to care 
More than just a bit 
Now I know that if at first you don't always succeed 
You can always quit! 

Some say I'm a complainer and others at me scoff 
But as for what I think of that well they can all piss off 
My misery is company it forces me to think 
Like right now, for example, I think I'll have a drink"

One of them came at me and I started running away, dialing 911 on my cell phone. He caught me and was trying to rip my clothes off but I managed to get away. I got turned around in the back streets and was trying to get somewhere with people and light, cause I think he was still following me. I ran into the lobby of a building that I THINK was a dorm. There were people in the lobby area and they were so not helpful. I made a phone call and then Nat came into the lobby to pick me up. I ran over to her, threw my arms around her and started sobbing. Then I woke up.&nbsp; What is with my crazy-ass dreams?</p>"

"event","Totally&nbsp;by accident dyed my hair purple today. I bought this color that was called Chocolate Cherry, which is supposed to be&nbsp;like&nbsp;a deep brown with a reddish tinge to it. I think I may have either put too much on, left it on too long or both because my hair is now&nbsp;a purpley-black. :) I freaked at first. Then Corey came home and said he adored it, which Nat said&nbsp;he would, since she is all-knowing and wise. :) :) :) :)&nbsp;So yey. I have purpley hair. It's so cool. I cant stop looking at it.&nbsp;

Last&nbsp;night, I had the weirdest&nbsp;dreams. What is with my dreams lately?? I had&nbsp;3&nbsp;dreams in a row last week that my mom had bought me a Coach purse (which is like, huh?!), then I&nbsp;keep having dreams that I'm being captured or held. And now last night, I dream about my worst nightmare happening again, the dreaded R-word (which is a bad word, we dont say that word) and who is there to comfort me&nbsp;when in my dream I am having (weirdly enough) flashbacks? My ex. NOT, as you would probably assume, the ex I ran into the other day&nbsp;for the first time in 6 years since last he suddenly disappeared on me. My other ex that I recently reconciled with (yey!). My subconcious is either doped up or trying to tell me something deep that I just dont understand.&nbsp;

My hubby is out working on a job right now, yes&nbsp;at 1230 in the morning, so I am going to make a valiant attempt to go to bed, although it&nbsp;probably wont happen as&nbsp;the second I lay down and start to relax, I will no doubt hear burglars and start to freak out, per usual. So I'll just end up watching TV&nbsp;til he's&nbsp;home. :) &nbsp;"

"event","Stevie was amazing last night. :) Well, the hour, hour and&nbsp;a half we saw of her anyway! The concert was supposed to start at 730. Around 710 or so, JUST as we were pulling into a parking space, the skies opened and it started stormin' like mad. So we rushed through the rain to the concert hall, which I might add is an OPEN&nbsp;hall as its an outside amphitheater.&nbsp;I'm not sure when they opened the doors, but I'm thinking it was maybe, 815? Since they had to wait til the lightening stopped. Then we had to wait for the downpour to stop, which it did, for about 20 minutes. In that 20 minutes, they cleaned the stage, set up the instruments, etc, etc. Then guess what happened? Yep, starting pouring again. So the concert did not start til almost 1000. I dont think we got a whole show either, since the amphitheater is&nbsp;required to shut down at 1100pm&nbsp;because of neighbors. I think they played til almost 1130 though. I have never been so wet in my life. It rained the whole darn night. But Stevie was worth it. :) People&nbsp;were leaving left and right. Corey's&nbsp;like,&nbsp;maybe we&nbsp;should give&nbsp;up and leave, I'll&nbsp;bet they'll cancel it. I told him I had been waiting to see Stevie for months and I was not going anywhere without seeing her or being told to leave. :) It was&nbsp;awesome. And wet. But awesome.&nbsp;"

The ex I was totally mad about and wasnt that great of a friend, as he kinda just dumped me and everyone else everytime his ex called. But still, I was crazy about him. It was so weird. So weird. Even weirder (and good) was that looking at him, it was like, what on earth was I so crazy about? It was nice. I only have a few exes that I never really got closure with so it's nice. I think I only have one left. LOL. Its like it all happened in another life though. I feel a shock whenever I see the scars on my wrists because it was a different person entirely and for the life of me I cannot remember that horrid feeling. I still get depressed and anxious, but nowhere near as bad. Probably because of Corey. :) Still. I sometimes wonder when I meet new people, if they notice the scars and what they must think of me. Like, I'm a leper or something. :) I need to find some of that....is it vitman A that is supposed to minimize scarring?"

I really need that, too, because honestly, right now I feel like I must have done something to pi** God off in another life or something because nothing good ever happens to Corey and I. No matter how hard we try, life just keeps finding new ways to throw sh** in front of us. I try my hardest to stay positive and keep reminding myself that no matter what, I married the man of my dreams, but some days it's like, SIGH. Seriously. SIGH."

Ok, the girl is 15, first off. Second, she was posing topless with a bedsheet. Topless people. And she CLAIMS that she never thought it would be trashy, just artistic. Yeah. Not trashy for a 15 year old to pose topless. Sure. I can see how one might think that would not be skanky. If one has the IQ of a peanut."

We have no one else lined up nor have we had ANY bites on selling it. I'm doing my absolute best to make my husband's life simpler, by not spending money, not complaining about what we dont have, giving stuff up for him, whatever, but there is one thing that I cannot and will not do. I will not move back to Maumee. I hated it there, and I love it in Perrysburg. I'd rather live in a smaller apartment than back in that house. I hate doing that to my hubby, but I just cant do it. I cant. So now....we're kinda at a loss...Hmmm...

Why did I nearly throw it out the window? Well, as I was putting in my CC info to buy my 4TH ROW SEATS, my keyboard decided that NOW would be an excellent time to die. So I could not fill the info in on my computer, I had to switch to my husbands and by that time, best tickets I could get were row U. I cried.

My dream was that I'd been kidnapped, by like, 2-3 girls who were really dumb and for some reason I had access to a cell phone. So I called Locke and screamed at him ""Help, I've been kidnapped"" before they took the cell phone with me. And then, for some reason, I got ahold of the cell phone again and called him again to give him clues to where I was. Then the girls decided to kill me and a few other captives (because for some reason, there were other kidnappee's) and while I was on my knees, I saw Locke sneak into the room. He came up behind the girl who was about to kill me, and she was so dumb, she didnt hear or see him, so he stood behind her and crossed his arms, waiting for her to realize he was there. :) Then he saved me, and now he's freaking gorgeous to me. He was always hot. But now, wooooooo....:) 

Sigh. What a dream.

I never realized before how much winter affects my mood. I love winter! I love snow!! But when the sun came out and the temp went up to the 50's a few weeks ago, I found myself in the absolute best mood ever. And yesterday, again, the best mood! I feel like I've been severely depressed and suddenly I'm on Prozak! Its odd."

I was actually starting to spend my weekends dreading Monday, to the point that I couldnt enjoy my weekends anymore. Thats what happened when I worked at Bill Knapps (although to be fair, I worked 60 hour weeks and sometimes went 2 weeks without a day off...that would kill the strongest person). So I quit, because the stress level was too high. Then I thought, maybe I cant handle ANY job! I mean, my god, I had that job for only 7 months! Now my hubby is probably looking at me like I'm a huge failure and all I want to do is work at the costume shop where I feel comfortable, even though it will be hard to get 40 hours a week and its definetely less money. So now I feel horrid that I dont really want to find another stressful job with more money right now. I want to stay at the shop at least for a few months, mainly cause they really need me right now and partly cause I just need the break from the stress. But I feel really selfish because now, we need the money more than ever. 

It'll be ok, though, right? Just need to learn to budget and save a little more money. Right? I'm not a failure, right?"

"event","so, i passed my server training, and just hopefully only will have one day left under supervision, then i am out on my own. but what bites... they changedthe menu on me, so i have new prices to memorize. i cut my hair, and i loved it the first day i go it, which was 2 days ago, now... im sick of it, and i want it to grow out, it looks like a mullet! 
orientation was fun, hung out with the same 3 guys the whole time, cuz most ofthe girls were either boring, afraid of me, or skanks. people already started talking shit, but whatever, those kids will get bit in the ass sooner or later. 

i just love my job, and i dont have some lame-ass job, like working at vans, and thinking im the shit...because i actually make money, unlike some people that i know. i help people when i can with my job, as well, i dont use my resources selfishly, like some little shits i know that shall remain unamed.

summer has been a disappointment, cabo was amazing, but other than that, every one fucked me over. no road trip, like i promised myself, no hawaii, no beach day, it was a  total bust. thats the last time i spend my summer unsingle. im tired of this shit. anyways, college will be an experience all in its own, and it is somthing that i am looking forward to very much, now, for some reason.... ooh, i know why... they offer free massages on campus..WOOP WOOP!"

IM SORRY IM GROWING UP! ITS NOT MY FAULT YOUR SISTER DIED OF COLON CANCER AND NOW YOU HAVE TO GET A PROBE UP YOUR ASS ONCE A YEAR! geeze..i end up being their scapegoat for everything! all i did was be nice to her, and go out and run little errands to make her feel better. its good to know my good efforts always go unnoticed. all i ask is some consideration. i dont get it. them bring ""proud"" of me is a load of bullshit. im not their straight A 4.0 or 3.8 student, im not going to a prominenet university, to some people in the family, my greatest accomplishment is getting out of high school without getting pregnant...nice to know my family's got real high expectations for me. im done venting...really, im not... i just neeed to get out."

"event","im tired of being taken advantage of. im done being the girlfriend who will obey his every wish, and the perfect daughter who will always do as shes told. im tired of being other people's bitch, pretty much. i dont know who the hell i am, or what im going to do. i just wander out into the universe with nothing to do, and almost no one to trust. apparently, im not that important to him. whatever. im all out of suggestions for myself, i have no idea what to do with him anymore. i should start over. im done with this shit. yadda yadda yadda! money this, money that. we arent even married and we're already arguing over fucking money. i hate it, and i hate this capitalist nation. im so.....urrrrgh! i cantt even begin to describe my frustration with the world right now. im out.. bye homies! <3"

"event","i hate people who butt into other people's business. then you tell them, as nicely as possible that its not their business... and they get mad at you! i hate people. people suck. i was a fucking wreck driving to rehearsal last night, and i made it safe up until i pulled into the parking lot, when one of the parents nearly rammed rightinto my put put, oh man, i was pissed. i stayed home today, to rest and get over feeling like shit, and some people ruined my day, i got no sleep, no work done, and no rest whatsoever. i have to go to the dentist today, and it bites. my dogs keep farting, and they stink up the whole damn house. anyways, i guess i should go to bed, and try to relax. fatty's coming over today, that'll be a treat... oh dear. well... im off, to do, whatever tired people do."

"event","Hi everyone. Bret and I are looking for a roommate for the spring semester (Adam is going to France for the semester.) We live in Parkwest apartments. Rent is $295 per month. I know it's a little early, but we want to make sure we get a good roommate. So if you know anyone who's interested let me know. Please!"

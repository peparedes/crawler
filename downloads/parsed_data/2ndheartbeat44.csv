"event","Life under no circumstances seems like it can be reliant on ones plans, there will always be a shift to some degree about some detail.  Wether it be that little shift in your step from the left to the right, or the news dropped in your lap that you just can't seem to handle.  From my experience there are people that try to plan there are most often two kinds of people, those who plan and those who just go not in any particular direction.  These two people aren't really so different from each other; the planner feels like they lose people somewhere in their careful planning and specific details.  Now, the one who just goes, simply becomes lost, not that they mind being lost, but when they finally figure out where they are, they realize it'll never be what it was.  To live is to experience, to experience is to be present, to be present you must truly be wherever you are in the midst of your plan, or your unknown adventure <em>on purpose.</em>"

"event","I figured I'd share a few facts in regards to a Boeing 757, specifically the plane used to crash into the pentagon.
-Each Boeing 757 is made up of a Steel Titanium alloy that's approximately 9 feet in diameter
-Titanium if you look on the periodic table of elements has a melting point of 1688 degrees celsius
-Jet fuel is a hybrid of hydrogen and carbon; it's a hydrocarbon, now those 2 elements have a combined melting point of 1120 degrees celsius, however to maintain such a temperature a fuel source must be maintained
-The government said jet fuel destroyed all evidence of a plane, except for a few pieces of scrap metal

I ask you what do you think happened?

"event","It's silly the lengths people seem to go to to create drama, people hold on to grudges, stay sour about things that happened months or years ago.  Its foolish, all the people that claim to want a better world and yet they don't do a single thing about it.  They in some instances would rather go party and get wasted with their friends, living out the ""best years"" of their life with a stomach full of alcohol and a system under the influence.  No one seeks betterment for themselves, instead they leave themselves blind.  They'd rather poke fun at disadvantaged people that for whatever reason, weather it stem from poverty, or a bad home with worse parents.  Flashing those dirty looks, because for whatever reason they seem to think that they are on some level far beyond our own, feeling some false sense of privilege.  Then there are the dreamers who with all their big dreams seem unable to even put one foot in the right direction, each moment they spend hesitating the things they really want out of life seem to become nothing bet a spec on the horizon of one possible future.  I cannot wait for the opportunity to just travel across the country by whatever means, absorbing different atmospheres and attitudes.  With barely a dollar in my pocket, I will see what's out there through more than just a flashy HD television screen, and I will be better for it.  We see people we recognize and we waste our time with the conversations that we don't really want to have, that always go the same way.  ""Oh, hey long time no see.  What are you doing now?(and vice versa)"" and really you both avoided to even look at each other just so you would be saved the awkwardness of this conversation, but for one moment you locked eyes and you knew you had to have to give each other that acknowledgment.  I refuse to be one of the people 5 years from now still stuck in this town, I may have had obstacles that have kept me here longer than I would have liked, but I'm willing to work through and beyond them.  And to you, if I cannot get decency let me know, so at some point in the future I won't have to waste my time, hold that bitterness as long as you'd like.  Regardless, of what happens, I'll walk down whatever road I happen to come across, with a grin on my face and my optimism in tow.  I wish the best to everyone that decides to get the most out of their life.

Still I'm convinced, wondering what if is the worst thing there is.  So we bottled and shelved all our regrets,
Let them ferment and came back to our senses.  Drove back home and slept a few days, woke up and laughed at how stupid we used to be.

I guess being this tired was pretty worth it, even though it was Thursday, and there wasn't a huge number of people, we were able to really talk to The Killing Moon about things in terms of shows, and things like that.  One of the members is giving us contacts to venues all over the east coast and some on the west.  What was really sweet but I'm not really expecting it to have much meaning to people.  One of the members of The Killing Moon said we sounded remotely similar to The Fully Down, except with better harmonies, and melodies.  Which certainly isn't a bad compliment coming from a person that is on one of the largest independent labels in the US.
And it's pretty sick, that we have another show with The Killing Moon this weekend like 3 hours away.  The only bad part about all this is yeah, I'm only going to start being around here on the weekends and some of the week days less and less.  So, yeah I'm going to end this, so I start my paper, so you don't tweak out."

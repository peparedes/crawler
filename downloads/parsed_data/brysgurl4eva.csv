"event","Oh my fuckin god.  I feel so depressed.  Everyone I love is in Kirkland...and your lives are carrying on without me.  I feel so left out...in the dark...so empty.  i wish you guys knew what it was like to have friends like you and just get ripped away.  I mean, you may think you know but you don't.  The only one who might have a little clue would be MY Kaiti.  I just want to sit in a dark corner and cry...which I've done six times today...even though it's still day so its still light outside.  I've sat in my fuckin closet and cried six fuckin times today just cause I miss all of you and because I feel so lost it's not funny.  If I ever get out of here, I'll be amazed...shit my pants...and then I'll come down to see you.  I have no idea how to express how I'm feeling...it sucks ass...
Off topic...I'm sorta going out with Scott again...but not really..."

"event","Hmmph...I'm trying to make the hardest decision.  The question is...go to the 9th grade partay...which is gonna suck...or not go and never be able to have that memory?  See, the thing is that the partay is gonna be at the school and be just like a dance pretty much. I think it's gonna suck.  And...Bry's going with Ashleigh...not me.  That one really hurts.   don't know if  should go or not cause it's an escape from bein in trouble at home...Kaiti...when you read the message called Last Words...you'll understand...but yet I don't want to go and see the love of my life dancing with my one of my ex-best friends.  Tough call.  Any idea as to what to do? I got no idea.  This hurts. I need Bryan.  Yall wouldn't understand...we are SO god-damn close...we're gonna get marr...nevermind...not sayin it.  *sigh* I'll tell who I want when the time comes."

"event","It all began again today.  Trying learn to deal with this new life that my parents and the other adults around me have pushed me into.  Well, instead of writing how horrible it is, I have to say, today is going great.  I was having an ok day when I headed to fourth period (now Lowman's class) and all of a sudden, Bry comes walkin up behind me and starts talkin to me.  I could have melted right then and there.  I want to be with him so incredibly bad!  I know he loves me and I told him that I know.  He said he wasn't gonna say anything.  It was cute.  He was all acting like it was a secret.  We all know that I know everything about him so really it's no secret at all.  Then, he gave me a hug.  Well, at lunch, I sat down in a chair and he pulled me over to him and kept pokin me and was playin little games...and he was tellin Whitney how I ""enjoyed his tongue in my mouth"" and how ""I would enjoy it again"" and all that.  It was great.  I told him that I couldn't believe I was eating lunch and when he asked why I told him that I'd just puke it up.  Well,after I said that, he said something about how I should get pregnant and then gain some weight that way.  Whitney whispered something in my ear and he's all ""I don't want to get her pregnant right now...""  So, yeah.  He still loves me!  *dances with joy*"

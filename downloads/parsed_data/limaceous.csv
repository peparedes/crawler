"event","I started writing this a few weeks ago, as you can tell by the references to November, but (as is the case with much of the things I start writing) I lost steam and went to sleep.  So tonight I am going to try and finish it!

It begins:

Kathleen and I have been living in Florida for six months now.  Halloween is over and the weather is getting nice.  It doesn't seem right to be surrounded by all this green in November.  Still, on some mornings, if the wind is right, I get just a hint of that winter air smell...a cool little breath of Minnesota air that found its way down across the long brown expanse of America to our muggy gulf-coast town.

It's strange how a place washes over you.  How the names of the streets stop sounding strange.  How the Nicollets and Lyndales become the McMullens and Drews.  A whole new group of early pioneers who stamped their names on street signs and gravestones.  

Downtown Clearwater is a bizarre ghost of a place.  The streets are filled with white, middle-aged men and women in navy blue pants and white, tucked shirts.  Black beepers hanging from their belts.  They are Sea Org, the upper echelon of the Church of Scientology.  Seeing them roam the downtown streets in great packs, you feel like an H. P. Lovecraft character who has just realized there is something very strange about the people of Dunwich.  

My boss was telling me the other day about how he was walking the dog downtown when he passed a disused old bank.  There was a crumbling piece of paper taped to the window of the drive-through teller.  It read, ""This window is closed, please enter through main lobby.""  It was dated 1993.

That seems to be normal here.  It isn't sketchy or dangerous...there are just dozens and dozens of abandoned, empty buildings.  Just down the street from us there is a derelict bank building that has been for sale since we moved here and will most likely still be for sale when we move home.  There is a blue toilet next to the dumpster, which is slowly filling with trash that no one will ever empty.  We live near a shuttered Dunkin Donuts, Kathleen works right next to a derelict Popeye's Chicken.  The drive into downtown is littered with signs on buildings announcing new businesses that will never open.  Even amidst the gleaming froth of wealth that builds up along the beaches, failed retail outlets and half-finished condo constructions are common.  

It's not all doom and gloom though.  The WalMart across the street is expanding into a Super WalMart.  Hopefully the invalid greater there will get to upgrade to a Super oxygen tank.  

There is a building just down the street that is the site of one of the world's largest apparitions of the Virgin Mary caused by oil in the windows reacting to water from a sprinkler system or something:


<img src=""http://aintnogod.com/images/Our-Lady-of-the-Irridescent-Office-Windows.jpg"" />

The building began attracting attention from Catholic worshipers and is now the worlds most unseemly church.

Our apartment is pretty great.  Across the narrow parking lot, above the storm drain swamp, a black cormorant suns its wings in the morning.  White Ibises peck their way along the bank like scimitar-beaked chickens.  Spanish moss hangs from tall cypress.  

It's been weird adapting to Florida wildlife.  Plants that bore natives, but fascinate and bewilder me, grow everywhere with ease.  The Southern Magnolia, the Cabbage Palm, Birds of Paradise, Banana Trees and Coconuts.  I've had encounters with wild manatees, hermit crabs, mollusks, pelicans, urchins, anemones and many a curious fungus.  

It still seems strange to me, when I sit back and realize where we are...and how we got here.  How we packed everything we owned into a giant trailer and drove it across the country.  

I've been thinking a lot about the future.  We've been on autopilot for a while now, and it's just now donning on me that, in the future, we'll be saying things like, ""Well, we lived in Florida for a few years..."" and, ""While we were living in Florida...""  It still feels like an extended vacation.  My life is still in MN.  I hope it's waiting for me there.  I hope it will still be there for me when I come back.  I've poured a lot of myself into FrightProps.  Enough that I can't leave it without seeing where it goes.  I miss Minnesota.  I miss rocks and clean fresh water.  I miss all my friends and my family.  I wouldn't be able to survive here without Kathleen.  She really is the best thing that's ever happened to me.  

I have 5 years until my self-imposed deadline for owning a house comes due.  Right now, I want that house to be in MN.  That's sort of scary.  It means no FrightProps, the driving force in my life for the past 5 years.  It means finding another way to make money.  Maybe taxidermy?  Who knows.  Maybe FrightProps will be forced to quit before I am.  Lots of maybes.  

For now, I'm going to enjoy the ocean.  I'm going to enjoy the fast-sinking sun.  

I'm 30 years old.

It's time to get to work."

Kathleen and I will be back in MN for the 3rd week in January to celebrate the holidays (since Kathleen can't get the real deal off work).

It's a Saturday through a Saturday.  So, I think everyone should take some days off work that week and party with us!  I would love to have some outdoor wintery adventures.  Or some sort of holiday get-togetehr with you goobers to share in the spirit of the holidays and shit.  Anybody got any sweet ideas?"

"event","Fright Props is moving...to Florida.  This means that Kathleen and I have to decide if we want to move to Florida...in three months.  We would be living in a town called Clearwater on the gulf coast.  Here's my major list of pros and cons so far:

Pros:
-Full time work at a job I love
-New crazy dead animals to find
-Marine life
-Living somewhere other than MN for the first time in my life
-Warmth

Cons:
-Being so far away from friends and family, especially my mom
-Warmth...I hate warmth!
-Living somewhere other than MN for the first time in my life...I do love MN

Obviously we have a lot of thinking to do.  I am alternately excited and terrified by the idea.  At the moment though, I think I will probably go.  After all, we can always come back if it sucks too bad...and I would be stupid not to try and keep the best job I've ever had....but...but...no more DND!!!!  Then again...30 minute drive to sea world!  GLARG!"

"event","So it's almost 3:00am as I start writing this and I can't sleep.  

I was just looking back through old LJ entries, trying to figure out when I started working at FrightProps, being confounded by the shear number of things I have written and forgot.  I think I need to make a concerted effort to write more.  

I've been working for FrightProps for almost three-and-a-half years now.  It's so hard to remember the fear and excitement of starting out...so bewildering to think that on my very first day Doug wasn't even there.  I just sat by myself in a small corner of an unfamiliar warehouse sculpting a pair of mutilated arms.  I had no idea how to sculpt, no idea how to make a mold.  I had never smelled latex, never had to rip cured foam off my arm hairs.  Almost four years later and I've just completed an enormous octopus prop...over 525 pounds of clay, a wooden armature that I built from scratch, a huge polyurethane mold...and now this sort of thing is expected of me.  When I meet new friends and tell them what I do, can they see how improbable it is?  We are all slowly becoming something other than just the boy...the girl.  Scott the Prop Maker, Mary the Editor, Kelly the Social Worker, Tim the Illustrator.  In a few more years these paths will seem to have been inevitable.  I'm hoping tonight, by the hum of the heater and the sounds of Kathleen sleeping peacefully behind me, to remind myself of life's capacity to surprise."

We had a small degree of popularity in the underground death metal scene.  The following is my most treasured keepsake of that era: some ""fan mail"" from prison.  Read on, if you dare.

Some context:  In any ads we took out for the disc, or in any posters for shows, we would, if possible, talk at length about how gay we all were.  The slogan that has these particular inmates so bothered is, ""Are you gay enough?""  Apparently they weren't.

"event","To my friends,

Some of you may know that my mother has been suffering from Parkinson's Disease for a long time now.  A few days ago she fell at home and had to be taken to the hospital.  Since that time she has been consumed by powerful delusions, possibly a side effect of her medication, possibly due to the advancing disease.  My father has been at her side constantly and the rest of use are trying to be with her as much as we can.  So if I seem weird or out of sorts, that's why.  Hanging out with everyone has been a great relief during this very stressful time.  She is in very good hands and we are hopeful that her condition will improve, but she will most likely need to be under constant medical supervision from this time forward.  I was a little wary about writing this.  Part of me wants to keep it all a secret and pretend everything is normal, but that's probably the same part that wants to deny it's happening at all.  The time I spend with all of you, seeing movies, playing D&D is extremely therapeutic and for that I thank you."

It might be the most impressive piece of interactive entertainment I've ever seen.  It's not for everybody, and if you want a game that does more than just let you create an insane creature and parade it around a virtual pen, then I guess you won't like it.  But everyone else needs to get this immediately and start making some fucked up shit!  I've spent hours messing with it tonight on Kathleen's computer and have made some ungodly abominations, including a creature that does nothing but lick it's own ass.  Here's my spore version of myself including realistic dick and balls.  Enjoy!

Brett especially needs to get this as soon as possible.

In other news Kathleen and I went to the zoo today to see the new Russia's Grizzly Coast exhibit.  The exhibit itself is very nice, paying equal attention to the wildlife and interesting geological peculiarities of the ecosystem.  There are really only a few new animals, sea otters, wild boars, snow leopards (which are too shy to be seen) and of course grizzly bears.  I thought the bears would be boring, but their enclosure is so well designed it keeps the bears right up in your face, going nuts swimming around trying to grab fish, shaking their big shaggy heads.  It was great.  And the new Minnesota trail is awesome too.  The wolverine kept trying to jump on people.   

Check out this sweet ass bear:

<img src=""http://www.bibus.liquid-fish.com/images/zoo/1.jpg"">

We also saw an even more amazing creature, the elusive Zoo Slut.  Mary, as fashion queen of the group, what do you say to this daring ensemble:

<img src=""http://www.bibus.liquid-fish.com/images/zoo/2.jpg"">

Pardon the blurriness, I was trying to keep from barfing.

In one final bit of news, a car smashed into the retaining wall outside our apartment today.  Kathleen and I looked out the window just in time to see the retards try to drive away in their totaled car.  They didn't get far, but the wrought iron fence and cinder blocks they hit got pretty far.  Before that retaining wall was built there was just a little hill there, and if it has still been that way there would have been a car in our front porch.  It was awesome.

All and all a great day.

Later chumps!

SPORE!

Update:  Go here to see all the dumb shit I've made so far!

It's been a long time!

I've got some images and factoids to share with you.

First off, here's a brand new prop prototype for you:

<img src=""http://www.bibus.liquid-fish.com/images/pigwhite.jpg"">

I'm calling that one Sliced Piglet.  We'll be putting out a series of butchered/freak/experiment pigs soon.  There should be lots of new props coming out now.  Our goal over at FrightProps HQ is to have 10 new products by March.  We'll see if I get there!

Also, I made this for a dude in Michigan:

<img src=""http://www.bibus.liquid-fish.com/images/raycat1.jpg"">

I talked to a class at Macalester on Friday.  It was really fun.  To get an idea of what we talked about you can listen to this mp3.  It's from a series of lectures on Body Worlds.  The speaker is Carl Eliot, a professor at the UofM.

<a href=""http://blog.lib.umn.edu/sphpod/sphpod/2006/07/bodyworlds_as_taxidermy.html"">click here for mispronunciation of my last name</a>

The following is a list of some awesome stuff.

1.  As of last month I have officially been dating Kathleen longer than any of my previous girlfriends.  This is because she is the best girlfriend ever and even bought me video games, which she hates, for my birthday.

2.  I have a facebook now.  If you are on there come be my friend.  I think this should go to my profile: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=812687368"">click it / lick it</a>

3.  Scrabulous is cool, but I could go for some real scrabble where people can't cheat MARY!

4.  I have been keeping a semi-regular video game related blog over at Destructoid for a while now.  If you want to read it go <a href=""http://www.destructoid.com/blogs/limaceous"">here</a>.  I guarantee it will bore you to death.

I'm going to NYC tomorrow to do a taxidermy demonstration as part of the Great Autumnal Taxidermy Get-Together...not sure what animal we will use yet...we're just going to see what the markets have to offer...China Town not Walstreet you retard.  The people in charge want us to use a fish but I sort of want to stick it to them and use a cute fluffy animal of some kind...perhaps an Eskimo baby.  

Halloween is almost here and I am going to take some time off work.  It's been a crazy season, very busy.  I am excited about working on new projects when I get back.

Last weekend we got to use our industry insider VIP status to go see Trails of Terror for free and skip the lines.  It was pretty boss.  They have a bunch of our stuff in their main haunted house.  The haunt was not too bad...there were areas of total darkness which is all I really ask for in a haunted house.  Bad acting though.  The best thing was the Upside Down House which presented you with the sheer terror of seeing what a room would look like with a table on the ceiling!  If you want to feel the terror first hand, just watch this:

Like Barry Bonds for instance.  Everybody hates him.  I think his earring is gay and he seems like a douchebag, but there're a lot of people who think his stats should be struck from the record because of his steroid use.  I wonder though, if any of the pitchers he's batted against also take steroids.  I bet a lot of them do.  I think we should just mandate that all athletes take the same performance enhancing drugs...level the field so to speak.  It's just one step closer to genetically engineered supermen playing DeathBall in pits of acid...and I can't wait for that.

Also, I saw this thing on cnn.com where a police officer was posing as a crazy homeless guy at a stoplight and catching people runnning the red light.  But I wonder if some of those people, seeing that they were jusssssstttttt going to miss the light, took notice of the enthusiastically gesticulating man in boxers and a bathrobe and decided, ""Hmmm, maybe I don't want to sit through an entire light cycle while this guy rants next to my window or maybe trys to clean my windshield with his dick.""  I know I for one have cut a few lights close because some 300-year-old shirtless mummy with a sign reading ""Will teabag for food!"" licked his lips at me.  

Maybe it's an astrological thing...are Libras known for always giving eneryone the benefit of the doubt?  I don't think I could ever be on a jury."

And this crazy slime:

<img src=""http://www.liquid-fish.com/images/mill2.jpg"">

I was sort of upset that we didn't see any dead animals...until we saw this....a dead body!


<img src=""http://www.liquid-fish.com/images/mill3.jpg"">

We had walked by this area ealrier and seen some cops standing around, but when we came back they had roped off the area with crime scene tape and the medical examiner and the MPD Crime Lab were there.  We watched as they pulled th ebody onto a stretcher, at one point it rolled out of the tarp...I saw a black sweater and an exposed area of pale flesh with some large purple bruises.  I have no idea what happened or he he was...the area is a sort of a bum hideout so we assume he might have been a homeless guy.

When we got home we watched some boxing and saw Dr. Wladimir ""The Steel Hammer"" Klitchko destroy the American Chris Byrd in a one-sided bout that further delivered control of the fragmented heavy weight division into the hands of Eastern Europe."

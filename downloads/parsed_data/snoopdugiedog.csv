My sound server does not want to have working sound; it's disappointing. 

We have the blockbuster online thing; it's pretty cool, but I think 3 movies at a time is way too much. 

I like working on the porch

Last weekend I went climbing; it was awesome

our apartment is clean, but could use some fixing up.

I got a bunch of oldies recently. 

There is pretty much no good weekend to go home.

I hate windows

I think my cd burner may be broken; I'll have to get it checked out. 

I'm going hiking tomorrow.

It's time for some new flip flops so I'm going to pick some up on my way back to Troy on Tuesday. 

Alex & Eric are going to get a cat.

Monday I have to go get my laptop fixed and actually start working 8 hours a day. 

I saw part of a climbing wall going down the road on the way here, and it made me want to go climbing really bad. Maybe, monday, I will take a break from work to go climbing."

The ""whatever"" clock is only $28 so I might buy it at some point over the summer.

I am in Kennebunk. 

My display on my laptop died, so I have to use an external display. it's kind of annoying. I probably won't use my computer much next week. Soon I have to do my Galois final though. 

Right now I have an incomplete in Galois theory, which makes my GPA look lower than usual.

I like my new suit. 

We're going to quebec memorial day weekend, which is pretty sweet. 

I think tomorrow I am going to call up IBM and find out how long it would take them to fix my laptop. If it's too long, I'll just get it fixed at RPI where they will give me a loaner. 

I don't think I'm going to go see Ben Folds or Dave Matthews at SPAC this summer, because I'd end up being really far from the band, which I don't really like. I greatly prefer small venues, or at least being up close to the band, but I've never been close in a large venue. Although I also really like dancing to the music, so maybe lawn tickets won't be so bad.

1024x768 is a teeny resolution, I don't know how I used to do it. There's like no space. The display on my laptop (when it works) is a little under twice as big. 

I have a lot of stuff to bring back up to school, but it won't be too bad, I just might have to leave some stuff at home and take it up later in my car, but I have to get all the big stuff up on the first trip.
<lj-cut text=""Some things I am bringing"">Some stuff I'm bringing:
Chair
fouton
other chair
maybe another chair, but I don't know, it used to be my grandmothers
Bureau
Bookshelf 
other bookshelf
bed (hopefully)
maybe a desk and desk chair, but doubtful

Then all the small stuff

oh, and here's a drink I found

"event","So it's been a while since I made a real post.

First off, big news, I'm getting an A in Math Analysis II, booyaa!!!!!

alright, other than that, nothing really interesting, other than that I like my friends, and I feel like my life is going really well (although I'm still not liking this whole single thing) 

I like a girl, I think I noted it at some point before, but then I kind of lost interest for some reason and now I like her again; so far as I know only two people know who exactly, one caught on and the other, I dropped a pretty obvious hint. 

I went to the first frat party that I've ever been to, I didn't stay long, but it was pretty good: I like the whole dancing part. Also, Red Death is really good, and since none of you know what it is, I shall explain: it's basically really strong spiked punch that doesn't taste like alcohol at all. 

I saw Spider Man 3 today, meh.

I haven't been climbing in forever; it kind of sucks. I was supposed to go to rumney last week, but everyone backed out, which was a major bummer. I plan on emailing like everyone I know in a somewhat ordered fashion this week to see if I can get anyone to go climbing on thursday. 

I got drunk last weekend, meh.

I'm really excited for this summer. and the house. 

I have to pack, like everything on friday. 

I bought a pound of Jelly Bellies today. And thus I got some free pretzels.

I bought three books since friday, one on Dave Matthews, a cookbook and a book by Christopher Moore. Speaking of said book, apparently Dave is a pacifist.

I think I'm going to buy a game.

There was this clock that said ""whatever"" and had the numbers in a pile in the corner, I want that clock.

I've stopped wearing my watch, aka, I am in vacation mode"

"event","I got a growler full of root bear last night from Browns, mmmmm.

It has been beautiful out, and thus my face is completely burnt.

I'm really excited For Guster on Thursday, even though it means I have a ton of work to do before thursday. (although I think I would have a ton of work to do regardless)

I wish my motivation was a little higher, just for this last week, but it is what it is.

I still wish I wasn't single. 

I'm really excited for the house this summer/next year. I'm voting against paying for TV, because it's bloody expensive, like $60/month, I would greatly prefer netFlix which is only like $25 for the most expensive (4 DVDs at a time). And maybe getting the New York Times, that would be pretty cool, and I hear you can get a really sweet deal from Fathers'.

Did I mention my face is burnt. I bought some sunscreen though, so maybe it won't happen again. 

I went home the weekend before the current one, and it was alright, I got a suit and it was really expensive, but fortunately my parents paid for it, but that's kind of exciting. I also got some new jeans, that are a little long, but I like them, and I think they'll get worked in perfectly. 

Wednesday they're doing a trial for this local food cafe thing, and I am going to help serve for the first hour, before my Topology meeting. 

I like a girl, and another and another. I think that's about all, out of the ones that I know. Also, I like having female friends. 

You should check to see if you can get FiOS from verizon, because it's really fast, and you get TV, phone, internet for like half the price of just cable internet, and the internet's faster. I wish we could get it at our house. Instead, I guess we'll have to live with cable. We might get separate internet too, because Eric, Trevor, Brandon and I are all pretty heavy internet users. 

We saw Running With Scissors, it wasn't as lighthearted as I thought it would be, but it was still good. Also, the soundtrack is really good

I have to get a bed sometime in the future. I'm confident though. Plus if I can't find one I still have my fouton, so it's not like I'll have to sleep on the floor or anything like that. 

PS: apparently The Mighty Quinn was originally by Bob Dylan"

I started doing Capoiera, and it's pretty cool, but I don't think I'm going to be able to continue doing it, because it's $80 per semester and I am poor.

I am definitely doing reserach here over the summer, and getting paid competitive wages, and living with Brandon and most likely Trevor and Eric over the summer in our house, which should be awesome.

I'm going home this weekend. 

Two weeks from Thursday is a Guster concert at Williams, which should be awesome. 

I was planning on doing work all this weekend, but then I ended up snowboarding Saturday and not doing any work until after midnight on Sunday. 

My WalkSAT algorithm is working at 95%+ percentile which is awesome. Although, it makes it really hard to debug.

I wrote two xmms2 clients, one for lyricwiki, and one that just has some basic controls.

I've found that root beer has similar effects to alcohol when taken in moderation (ie it won't actually get me drunk)."

I have no responsibilities for ROC next year. 

I don't think I should drink.

I made some burgers and they were good

It's been nice out

I haven't really done much work this week

I started writing a lyricwiki client for xmms2, which is pretty sweet

I may have to do my research for work this summer.

I have to do my taxes like now

Someone commited suicide on campus today. 

I'm really excited about my apartment next year.

There seem to be more attractive women around than there were a couple weeks ago. It's strange, but not really important or going to have any affect on anything. 

There were some guys that smoked pot in the gondola when I was separated from my family.

I got some new Cataldo music, which is good.

Well, big news is: Thursday night while I was working on MAII in the library Brandon emails me, seeing if I want to join with him and a bunch of other folks in an apartment next year, well, we checked it out, and although the quality of the building is not quite as good as my apartment, we get a full house to ourselves, with two porches and a deck and a little back yard and an attic and two kitchen's; Yay!! yeah, we signed the lease Friday which makes me feel poor so quickly because I had to put down a $530 deposit and it like cut my liquid assets in half. Fortunately, once I get my social security card, I get $570 and a week from Friday, another pay check, which will be sweet. Plus tax returns are coming, which should be like $1000 or a little less. So, yeah, Brandon and Nick are on my Flat and Eric, Trevor and Alex are upstairs. I think I'm going to get a hangboard if it's not a problem, so I can just, you know, do a few pull ups. I may have to buy a bed though, because it's unfurnished. 

Dear Mother Nature: WTF, mate!

I like my new <a href=""http://fixlinux.blogspot.com/"">blog</a> I have like 15 drafts, that I have to actually right complete posts for. 

I am still a failure with women. 

I did not get to go skiing this weekend, but c'est la vie. 

I'm not really sure what I'm going to take next semester, other than Prog Lang. 

Williams is on vacation this week, so that means 6 extra hours of time to do other stuff. 

The new Shins' album is kind of a disappointment.

I've been playing my bongo's rather regularly since spring break, which is good. 

I'm really kind of addicted to ""Outside Looking In"" by Darc Mind

Oh, and I rigged something together so that it's actually easy to change my futon from bed to couch before (aka, I kind of fixed it)."

Also, funny anecdote, I was in windows today, applying for a job (their site was all stupid and saying that firefox wasn't accepting cookies, even though it was) and I went to change my search bar search engine in IE and it opened up Firefox to display the list of potential search engines. HaHa, stupid windows.

And, I went to the Spill and Bean and I was going to try the panini, but the simple 3-Cheese panini was $10, so I was like, screw that, and got a lentil soup instead, which was good. 

I have a plant, I've named it Basil Fawlty after the John Cleese's character from Fawlty towers, because it's a basil plant. Hopefully it will grow. 

I like you can search for measurements or currency in google and it gives you conversions. 

It's a good thing that I have some level of thriftiness, because I went to the bookstore today, and if I didn't, I would have bought three or four books. Instead I wrote them down in my moleskine, and I'll take them out from the library (well, not the cookbook of course). 

PS: sleepy is much better than tired

PPS: PSs don't really make much sense for LJs because I could just go back and work it in, and it's not like there's connected thoughts or well organized paragraphs, it's just random. Oh well, it's fun to see what part of the alphabet would look like if I removed q and r (which I do sometimes think about doing)"

<lj-cut text=""Pain -> Drugs -> interview -> Jones Soda -> Wanting to Climb -> Car accident -> Stupid Snow Plow -> missed career fair -> awesome lunch with girl from party -> Shopping -> Backcountry Skiing -> House on Tuesday"">Tuesday morning I woke up with excruciating pain in my shoulder, at like 5 and then I managed to fall back asleep a little, and then I set up an appointment at the health center, for 9 and then the doctor there, redirected me to an orthopedic physician who took some x-rays, and said I probably had a rotator cuff contusion. so, yeah, that took the whole morning, and he prescribed some hydrocodone(vicotin) and so I was a little drugged up the rest of the day. In fact, later on I went to a meeting to work on math analysis HW and it went really well, except for the fact that I had to lie down for most of it. Then I didn't feel quite strong enough to get back to my apartment, so I passed out/slept on Fred's spare bed (thanks again Fred). the next day I felt fine, so I didn't take any more drugs. yadda yadda I have to get my research working and about 100 experiments done this week. Well, actually I have to get it working tomorrow. and I still have a ton of work to do. I went to an informal interview with bull, and that went well, except the fact that I got lost on the way. We went to Panera and it was good. I had a Jones Soda, Fufu Berry. 

I opened the wall on Thursday even though I couldn't climb, and I brought my book to read, but then I ended up talking to people and setting a route, that I really want to do know. Then I watched Grey's Anatomy and worked most of the night on my Math Analysis II homework. 
So Friday morning comes around, and I want to turn in my homework before I leave, in case I don't make it back by noon, for whatever reason. So, I drive down to campus and go to park on sage, and there's this SUV there, and there lights are on, and so I stop like half a space back, in case they are backing up, wait a few a seconds, and then they just back into me.Fortunately they were going so slow that there was no damage to the car, but, still, how do you just not look. Well, needless to say, I gave them room, and parked like 2 spaces back. And got out, and conveniently there was 15 minutes left on the meter, and I was like, sweet. So, I went and turned it and got some Tea, yay. Then I headed off to class at Willams, and shortly after getting on Route 2 I got stuck behind a school bus, and I was like, oh great this is going to make me late, but they only stopped once, so it didn't really affect my time at all. However, shortly after that, I got stuck behind a snow plow, that was just plowing the shoulder, and salting the road, so I was going 30 instead of 55, and I followed the plow for like half an hour; you'd think they could pull over just once, but no. So then  it was like 15 minutes before class starts, and I was like 45+ minutes away and still behind the snow plow (ie I would miss more than half the class), so I turned around, and missed class. Then, I decided, to go to the career fair, since I had some spare time.But, apparently I was mistaken as to what time it started, so after I walk down to campus I find out it wasn't going to open for like another 45 minutes, but I wasn't going to stay on campus so I went back to my apartment. Then, the really exciting and awesome part of friday came, I went downtown to meet that girl I met at the party (I got her screenname on Facebook), Lisa, and we had lunch at bruegger's and sat and talked for almost 3 hours. And that was good, and then she went to class, and I had to go to the bathroom really bad. So I started searching frantically for a public bathroom, and after checking a few places, I ended up at this cafe, The Spill and Bean and used the one that was like attached to there place and I think a few others. Anywho, I checked out there menu, and they have a whole bunch of paninis and so I'll have to go back there for lunch sometime. But, I had a cinnamon bun and some sort of fruity tea that I can't remember what it was, but it was good. Then, I went shopping at Uncle Sam's and spent a lot of money, but it was all stuff that I needed, except this Ginger Peach Green Tea, that is really really good. Then I got ready for today, which was, some amazing awesome wonderful backountry snowboarding. We also went to summit, but we decided to turn around like 30 feet from the summit, because the weather was atrocious. and then we skied down, wich was so amazing awesome. The only downside was the hiking up, and the last mile out. My shoulders are kind of killing me now, and I think it's from the bag. So then we were on the way back, and Scott me a little freaked out, because he reminded me that Valentine's Day was coming up, and for some reason I thought it was on Tuesday, when I just happen to be watching House with Lisa, but then he informed me it was Wednesday, so no real worries. Now, I am back at my apartment.</lj-cut>

Oh, yeah, and based on a horribly insufficient sample size, I have concluded that white pasta is way more sticky than whole wheat."

"event","The party last night was amazing, I met some really cool people, and had a little to drink. We danced and had a snowball fight, and made a snowman. It was a good time. I met this girl that I kind of like, but I, being the social genius that I am, did not ask for any sort of contact information. I crashed at Patrick's and then, this morning, got up and went snowboarding. It was pretty much amazing, because they got some powder. We did a bunch of glades and moguls, and it was wonderful. I can't wait to get my new shoes, hopefully they'll show up early next week. I saw a bunch of people from warren tonight."

"event","So, last night I went to the wall, it was awesome; I love climbing. 

So today I went to my first class at williams. It was cool, the professor was very energetic, although sometimes he seemed a little patronizing. One hour is a really short amount of time for a class. Williams seems pretty amazing, definitely a college town; one of the streets next to the college is just like cafes and the like, and there's nothing else around. The people, from a very shallow perspective, seem pretty cool. I was a couple minutes late for class, because i had some trouble finding parking, but no big deal. The drive there was very easy, there was like 2 turns. I went to the bookstore and bought the books for the class, and the bookstore was like a real book store, like they had other books, and it wasn't full of memorabilia (there was another store for that). I also got a moleskine so now I have a pocket moleskine. It was really really nice out. On the way back there was an accident at the intersection of Hoosick and Burdett so I had to drive down to Dominoes and take that road over and come back around. But, it happened like right next to me. 

I got a parking ticket today, and by today I actually mean Tuesday, but I haven't been to my car since then. Yeah, I forgot to put my rearview mirror thing back, so I thing I shall just leave it up, and also see if I can get the fine removed or something like that. But, it wasn't all bad, I threw the ticket like a frisbee onto the passenger seat and it slid across and fell nicely into the passenger door container-thingy. 

Tonight, party.

So, Petersburg Pass is on the way to Williams and it definitely needs more snow before backcountry can be undertaken. 

Tomorrow snowboarding on a mountain with lifts. 

Oh, my shoe is kind of dead, I can't wait for my new shoes show up, hopefully monday, before I have class. I'll post a picture have how mutilated my shoe is, if I can find someone with a camera I can borrow."

Sometimes, my friend gets asked out by this girl and says no, and I'm like WTF, why can't that happen to me. Probably because I'm a failure at starting conversations, or something like that. I'm working on it though, the new me.

"event","So I ordered my <a href=""http://www.alternativeoutfitters.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=453"">new shoes</a> with my new credit card. They're basically like converse all stars (what I have now) but less all the horrible things that converse does to make their shoes. 

Today I had the first of two SOLO Wilderness First Aid training; we're doing it tomorrow too, from 8-6. It's good to have a clue as to what to do if something goes wrong. There's this cute freshman. It made me wonder if I fall for women too easily. Like for many, many, many women, I fall for them, and then like a few weeks later I loose all attraction, what would happen if I actually asked these women out on dates. It also feel like I might be shallow, it's just what I'm attracted to is slightly different from the stereotypical, so I don't feel like I'm being shallow. Or maybe, I'm just going on the information I have a available, and, if more information became available, I would utilize that too. It's kind of like, how you're supposed to wear a suit to an interview. 

Oh, in case you were wondering, I am now an adult: I have a credit card and I am attracted to women, not girls. 

I went to http://www.edgeofexistence.org/ and it really depressed me. They had pictures of the Long Beaked Echidna. I love echidnas, they are definitely my favorite monotreme, way better than platypuses. 

So, I really have very little understanding of the entire female-male relationships between barely knowing someone and being in a serious relationship. Every once and a while I'm friends with a woman, but not very often. That kind of worries me. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to deal.

I like tea. 

I don't like doing work, especially Math Analysis II work. I'm not sure why, especially this week, when the problems are actually interesting. 

So, this research thing I worked on all of last semester, and am trying to write an article on, yeah, it doesn't work, and I'm not sure it can. Oh well. That kind of means that I have a ton of work to do this week. 

It was cold out today. It might be a little warmer tomorrow, but it's still going to be cold. 

I decided not to apply for internships in France, there is no way I can become fluent in time. Even though it would be awesome. Maybe I'll apply to a few jobs for when I graduate."

"event","So, Kayleigh, who you most likely do not know, said that there may be some girl that I could date in my math class, and I was all pessimistic and the like, basing the future off of the past, but I was wrong, there is a cute girl in my Math Analysis II class, that I could potentially date, assuming I learn to befriend people in class, and assuming she's single, and assuming her soul is  cute too. Yeah, that and the girl in my French class, and there are a few friends that have potential. Damnit, sometimes I wish one of them would make a move, and then I wouldn't have to worry so much. Oh well. Although, I've only made any real concious effort once, and I got rejected, maybe it would be nice to succeed with that.


So, I'm not so sure that I'm actually going to be taking my class at williams, because I haven't heard back from the professor I'm working through, which would be depressing. If I can't I'll just take a CS course, either Paradox and the Mechanical Mind, or Philosophy of Computer Science. We'll see. I'll probably audit the other regardless. Math Analysis II is going to suck royally. French looks the same. I hope I can get fluent soon, I have to watch movies. I'm going to apply to internships in France, because that would be awesome. Also, I'm going to talk to my French professor about other schools I could study abroad at, because it would be pretty sweet to take my math electives at a sweet school in France next fall. I still have a ton of places to apply for interships for. did I mention Math Analysis II is going to suck, the professor is all applied and whatnot. I can't wait to get that class behind me. I'm excited for advanced topology though, I have my book now. I may be getting paid for my research this semester instead of getting credit, like $1500 which would be sweet. I think if I do get paid instead of credit I will do some major commenting and software design stuff, with a little bit of actual research with the whole probability stuff, because polyscheme needs some serious commenting. 

Tomorrow: SNOWBOARDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Little known fact: The Pursuit of Happyness with Will smith is actually spelled like that, with a ""y"" did they mean to do that, because that would be kind of a depressing place to have a typo"

So  I didn't do too good of a job at job applications, but I did apply to a few places, maybe a few more today. 

I couldn't go skiing today, because the registrar did not send the letter that says I'm a student. Maybe Wednesday. 

I saw The Producers (the new one) with Caitlin, it was good.

The drive back wasn't too bad, there were a couple rain storms that I had to drive through, but nothing too bad. Oh, and the gift card thing wasn't working at O'Naturals so I had to pay with my Debit Card, and my entire meal wasn't free. I listened to a bunch of Harry Potter 5 on the way up, but I still only got like 9 chapters done.

I got my mom 1 and Love by The Beatles, and copied them to my computer before I left; I like The Beatles. 

It's nice to be back in my apt. 

I think I shall go climbing tomorrow at the wall. 

So, apparently the vacation at Williams doesn't line up with the RPI vacation, so I might not be coming home for vacation. Although I might skip a class, or come home for a three day weekend when they're on vacation, we'll see. I also have to figure out what to do about the fact that their finals are the week after RPI kicks me out. I guess I'll work something out with them, or crash at someone's place for a week, before I head home."

This spawns from a dream I had today, where there were stairs like that. I think there were three people that I knew in the dream.

I only have one major project, that continues to not work correctly, and I may end up seeing if I can kind of leave out the actual implementation part, and focus on the theory behind implementing it, and just kind of assume that other things work. I am basically done on friday, other than two take homes for next week. I can't wait. 
There's an OK Go concert on the 16th that I plan on going to. As Fast As is also playing, and two other bands that I've never heard of, and thus cannot remember. I still have to buy a ticket. 

In case I haven't already said so, Firefox is in french, and I love it. I think I might start transitioning my system to french. 

I like photography; I might take it up at some point. Artistically, that is. First I would need a camera.

Oh, and I plan on hanging out with people over winter break, all 4 weeks of it. 

On Wednesday I played Settler's and that was good, even though I lost. I also played Apple's to Apple's on Wednesday and on Friday. I like playing games like that. I played You Don't Know Jack on Friday; that wasn't so much fun, I think because you have to be so into the game. 

So I have one woman that I kind of like, but I don't know how much potential is there. I guess we'll see. 

I can't wait for XMMS2 to come out. 

I started planning my audio system for post graduation, which I guess is kind of foolish because there will be significantly different hardware out there. But I'm not sure. It will probably be something running gentoo, with a soundblaster X-Fi and some HD TV card, so I can use it as a tivo also. I'll probably throw in some $2000 7.1+ surround system from klipsch or Boston Acoustics. Oh well, that's probably 2 years away. 

Now, I have just a wee bit more work to do. So off I go"

Yeah, I kind of hate being single, we'll see what I can do about that. I also got a couple trouffles and I haven't had them yet. I also saw Gabi and Andy, and Ali. We went to Coldstone, and it was good. They had Didjiridoos at two of the places we went to. I was tempted to get one. I have to set up a budget meeting for ROC, because I'm the treasurer. I don't really like being the treasurer, too much work. I have some real work to do, but I'm almost done. I guess. Yeah, boo.

<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">Perhaps the most misunderstood of all the major arcana, the Devil is not really &quot;Satan&quot; at all, but Pan the half-goat nature god and/or Dionysius. These are gods of pleasure and abandon, of wild behavior and unbridled desires. This is a card about ambitions; it is also synonymous with temptation and addiction. On the flip side, however, the card can be a warning to someone who is too restrained, someone who never allows themselves to get passionate or messy or wild - or ambitious. This, too, is a form of enslavement. As a person, the Devil can stand for a man of money or erotic power, aggressive, controlling, or just persuasive. This is not to say a bad man, but certainly a powerful man who is hard to resist. The important thing is to remember that any chain is freely worn. In most cases, you are enslaved only because you allow it.</font></p>

"event","I have work to do. I went grocery shopping today, and I got clementines; oh how wonderful they are. 
I went climbing yesterday. I learned how to rappel. I tried to lead a climb, but it was too hard, and I couldn't get to the first bolt, how sad. It was a good time though.
I saw the new Will Ferrel movie, and it was good. Part of it actually related to what we were talking about on Friday in Anarchy & Democracy. I would explain it but it will probably destroy the plot, so You'll have to ask me.
That was Friday, by the way. 
I've been listening to the KEXP Song of the Day podcast recently. I like almost all of the music. I'm trying to get AmaroK to do the podcast thing so that it saves them in the folder I want, with the name I want, and I made a little python program to do it, but apparently they've changed the tags for the files, so the title of the song is preceded by ""Song A Day 123:"", which I don't want, so I have to get some mp3 tag editing libraries for Python, and then I can fix them using RegExps.
I have a half of a work hour for WRPI. Only 1.5 left to be a member and then 5 to get a show. 
I have a bunch of work to do between now and the end of the semester, UcK. 
I like Firefox 2, except the have close buttons on the tabs, rather than just one off to the right, which will take some getting used to.
Thunderbird is no longer in French :( I miss it. Maybe I'll go back. 
I bought Crackers today.
I'm kind of sick of work, but I have a bunch to do this week, and next week, and the week after that, and then the one after that, and a little to do the week after that, and then none.
OK Go, is apparently playing at Revolution Hall the Saturday after My last Final, so I will probably leave Sunday morning/Afternoon, which is still over a week before Christmas. I don't know what I'm going to do with myself this winter. Find a summer job, I guess. And cook. 
I've made some recipes out of my new cookbook, and they were good. I'm going to make another tonight.
I bruised my tailbone, it sucks, I can't lean back while sitting. 
AmaroK has this lyrics thing, and it goes to WikiLyric.org, but it's not very good, it couldn't find Iron & Wine, like any of his stuff. 
As long as my independent studies come through, I won't be actually taking Paradox and Mechanisms of the Mind, because that would be 20 credits, and that's just too much. 
Tonight I have to write a short paper (one page) about my AI Term Project. And then I should probably do most of my perl, and then do my Topology tomorrow, and then start on my next perl assignment. UcK."

My schedule for next semester looks quality:

<tr><td></td><td>12-2</td> <td>Paradox and Mechanisms of the Mind</td></tr>

<tr><td>Fri</td> <td>9-10</td> <td>Galois Theory</td></tr>
</table>
Plus an independent study in advanced Topology, and a little bit of my research(like 1 credit instead of 4).

In other news, I voted today. 
I also got a new cookbook last friday. 
I still have a ton of work to do, and apparently I have a test this friday. 
I like that my computer is almost all black.
I think my life is going ok, except that whole being single thing, that kind of sucks. 
I am going to go to bed so I can have sufficient rest to do my Topology homework tomorrow.
I had a really depressing Saturday: I woke up at 4, did work until 2 and then went to bed. Fortunately Kayleigh stopped by and chatted for a moment.

I don't like my desk chair; it's uncomfortable. But having my comfy chair here, is a major disruption to the room, so I'll have to figure out a new arrangement.
I think I'm going to go to bed now.

I finished a big chunk of work a short while ago, which does not mean I don't have a ton of work to do this weekend, because I do.

I've been listening to some Modest Mouse as of recently. 

I got my new Hard drive and copied over most of the stuff on my old one. Apparently one of my folders, just lost all of it's contents at some point. 

I'm going to be doing an Independent Study in advanced Topology next semester, but I'm not sure whether pointwise or algebraic. I may do pointwise next semester and then algebraic later. 

Jordan on Studio 60 reminds me sooooo much of my sister. 

Sometimes I wish I had a camera. Not for what most of you use camera's for, you know capturing the great moments of your life, but for artistic type things. Their were a lot of trees I wanted to take pictures of last night, the contrast with the night sky was just so cool. And then I have these quarters here.

I went to ecologic on Wednesday, and had some apple pie and it was good, and vegan. 

For the geeky ones out there: apparently gentoo is removing xmms from portage, because nobodies really maintaining it and all. So yeah, AmaroK it is, I guess. At least until xmms2 becomes remotely stable. Then I might switch to that. Although I am starting to like AmaroK.

Oh, and there's potential for me to only have classes on monday and thursday, which would be kind of cool. 

Tuesday night I moved my comfy chair over to my desk, but then realised it was a fire hazard so I moved it back for the fire-safety checks. 

oh, and I recently joined a debate club, although it's more of a political discussion club. brand new. It seems like it should be a good fun time."

Instead I went to Kaitlyn's birthday. It was a good time. 
I didn't drink, except at dinner. 
Kayleigh and Kery and I played some cribbage and that was good. Kayleigh and I also played earlier that day, before the party. She beat me by 2 points. 

Today has been sub par so far. 

The other day I was drinking some pineapple juice and notice in the condensation on the bottom of my glass there was a smiley face; that was pretty cool. 

I like Snow Patrol and The Mountain Goats. I also like how most of my computer is black now. 

I have some work to do. I don't really want to do it. 

My text is really small, and I'm not sure why. I could make it bigger, but that seems like a lot of work. 

Maybe I'll start my work; maybe I'll go lie down. maybe I'll do something completely different.

Oh, and I totally saw a guy on the Chicago Fire (Major League Soccer team) that looked exactly Justin (you know, the one that got married to Haley this summer)."

New Awesome quote from <a href=""http://www.eric-hutchinson.com/new/new_index.php"">Eric Hutchinson's site</a>:
Like abercrombie, only <b>cool</b>

In other news, the three day weekend is mostly over, and I haven't really accomplished much, but I did watch a few movies and hang out with people. Tomorrow I have to find a french job offer so that  I can write a letter for my Business French class. That should come in handy when I start searching for a co-op in France. Yeah in case you didn't know, I'm searching for a co-op for the fall, preferably in France, which would be awesome.

Oh, so today I was using Topology to comprehend some window manager designs, It was kind of exciting, even though I wasn't actually using my knowledge of topology. Yeah, anyway. I have a lot of classes left to take in the next two semesters, and by a lot I mean 9, which isn't actually a lot, but it feels like it. I have a lot of math left. My last semester is basically going to be a semester of math, except my last elective. Hopefully there will be some really sweet course that I'll be able to take. Hopefully HCI will be offered next semester. Or GUI building again. That would be really sweet. Squirrels are calming by the way. 
I think they're playing the second Pirate's of the Caribbean next weekend, which would be sweet. I'll have to go to the midnight showing since my parents will be here, with my car. I think I should probably go climbing at the wall sometime tomorrow. Because I haven't been in like forever. Also, I won't be able to go this wednesday because of a financial workshop that I am supposed to go to as the treasurer. 
I really like having a toaster, because making toast in the oven is a colossal pain. 
I have to do a term project for AI, which is going to be a pain, and probably be my least favorite thing about the class. 

So, just a reminder to all you socialists/communists out there: ""Harrison Bergeron"" by Kurt Vonnegut. That story always freaks me out, and reminds me how difficult it is to balance positive and negative rights. 
School for the Dead is playing in Boston on November 5th. I'm almost tempted to go, but I'd have to blow off at least my first two classes of the day, so I probably won't. However, it is more likely that I will be going to Mount Holyoke's cabin on the 21st, because, aparently, they've invited the outing club. that would be pretty sweet. A nice change of scenery at least. And hopefully some climbing. That would be sweet. 

My junkmail system seems to be working pretty well. Aparently, almost everything I get from outside of rpi, is junk, or from someone who's email I already know, and thus is filtered as not junk. 

My hair is definitely long enough for a pony tail now. In case you cared. 

I missed listening to concerts, and thus I am going to get a new hard drive so that I can copy over the ones I have and then actually listen to them from time to time. I listened to two of the ones I have on CD this weekend, though. 

I also went on this Green Building tour thing, we went to two different houses and checked them out. I didn't really learn that much. 

Oh, for all you geeks out there Stylish is way better than Greasemonkey, if you can get stylish to take care of what you want; Soooooooooooooooooooooooo much faster. Some of the sites, take a really long time, but if the site is actually set up really well with CSS and whatnot, it's pretty easy, and can turn out really nice. 

rockclimbing.com seems to be taking forever as of recently; it's annoying.

I tried working on my weather widget this weekend, but I'm still having problems with threads. Maybe I'll get it working later; that would be pretty nice."

That French quiz, I actually got a 70, so not so bad. I have a ton of work due this week, but I won't have like anything due next week. 
I think that maybe 5.10 shouldn't be that hard to get to, because I can definitely climb as hard as people that do climb 5.10, just in the gym. 
I was going to go climbing today, but it ended up raining where we were going to go climbing.
I have a toaster now.
I am slowly turning the <strikethrough>world</strikethrough> internet black, by way of a newly found firefox extension that lets me replace stylesheets.
I have a microphone sticking out over me; it makes me feel like I should be recording something. 
I want to date a German girl, if only to have her whisper sweet nothings in german. I had to sing a love song to this girl to convince her that german could be used for other things besides deathmetal (although I think the lyrics actually did belong to a deathmetal song).

I obtained the first 6 HP books in mp3, I'm at chapter 10 of the first book. 
My classes are going well and I have a lot of them. I am currently taking the equivalent of 26 credits, except I don't have to write 2 papers, and don't really have to go to my Anarchy and Democracy class. 
I have a lot of work to do, both for class and for not.
I started my training for WRPI, so I can get a show, eventually.
""This Year"" by The Mountain Goats is definitely in the running for Song of the Semester. But it's the only one so far. Also, I love the Mountain Goats, in case you were wondering. 
I completely bombed a french quiz on tuesday, because I kind of forgot we were having it. I won't forget about the quiz on thursday. I will study wednesday. 

I like Grey's Anatomy. I also like 'Til Death and Happy Hour.

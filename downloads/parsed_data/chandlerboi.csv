"event","Well hello children.  It has been about 302483.6 years since I've even looked in this thingamajigger! And I don't know why cuz I love it! MUAH! Um so HI. It is definitely Christmas Eve and it definitely doesn't feel like it.  No snow, no family, and no good X-mas shows (like Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers specials!!!!) What a dumb Christmas thus far.  Well, so nothing new in my life... whoevers reading this, I'm sure you know about Tuck and everything else. so i'll spare us the details. Can I just say how cute Ed is?! lol, ok I did. I miss the little biscuit (oops, I almost (on accident) just typed BITCH instead of BISCUIT, they're sort of alike! hmpf, sorry Eddy).  Sometimes I just want to molest him. Hmmm, that is dirty of me. I kind of like it a lot. Sometimes.... Well, I need to go make an authentic RYAN CHANDLER christmas card for my booooooi Tuck.  Isn't that cuute? Shut up, I think it is. Like Shaquuuuuuana. LofuckinL, that was so random. We love it. Anyways, make lots of comments!  hehe, MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOODNIGHT! MUAH!"

"event","Wild fun word that no one knows about. My lil secret. That goes way back in the day... like freshmen year? Damn, random! Anyways... this week has been SOO boring. There has been like nothing to do, and no one wants to do anything. The only fun night was Monday when I hung out with Lisa and Kevin. WILD GAY MOVIES! Eeew my house has an annoying air freshener smell in it and it bothers me. I liked the way that it smelt before. Anyways, I feel like talking about boys. Which by the way I don't have! WAAAAA! LoL. I don't wanna be a ""his-hoe"" or anything. (LoL, like that word?) Sometimes. Buuuut... to me, it seems like thats the only thing in my life thats missing, like... the last piece of the puzzle to make the building stable. LoL, I think I just put two analogies together. Figure it out. But I'm SICK of searching for boyz and then having them turn out to be dumb. You know what I'm talking about. Its not that I'm lazy, I'm just tired of the same repetative procedure. I just want one to fall on my lap or something. HIIIIIIIIIIIIII. MUAH. Simple you would think? Chicken. And the reason why I've been thinking about this more is because all my Somersonians are going to college in a week :( *TEAR* I'll be so bored, just twiddling my thumbs all day. Hmpf. I hope that we all still play a lot and do not lose touch or not become good friends. OMG, and Tammy is a lesbian! YAY. Besides the point, LoL. So anyways, I have to get up and bring my mom to the car place tomorrow to get her car fixed. This by the way is @ 8 AM! Ridiculous. Then I'm bringing my g/f to work @ 10 because her car is broken. YAY, WILD MORNING SEX. YAY! Then I'm working 3:30-7. DUMB. But its because I have to go to a GREAT meeting so that (ut, LoL) I can get a lil baby blue circle on my WHITE name tag! Yes! Its ALL white now! Why? Cuz I'm a big boi now! WILD 18! Then HOPEFULLY people won't be dumb and will come and play after. I really really really want to. Ok, I love you! Goodnight baby! MUAH MUAH MUAH! OGT! PEACE OUT CUBSCOUT!"

"event","Yay! Its my birthday. WILD DAY! WILD DAY! I haven't even done anything fun yet! Like buy scratch tickets or powerball. I could go buy porn! yay! AND I need to pierce something just because I can. MUHAHAHA. Yeah, sooo today hasn't been exciting. I went to practice and no one said Happy Birthday to me. I haven't mentioned it, so I'm no surprised. They're dumb. And Lisa is working 6-11, which is the dumbest thing in the whole wide world. *EPHIPHANY* I bet Deb scheduled her on purpose so that she couldn't play with me. WAAAAA. Wild OooberBITCH! I need to cut my fingernails. I hope I get some good presents from my parents tonight. And my mom has been WAY too bitchy this week. SO she owes me. Spoiling my birthday week, seriously! OH! I am SOOOO glad that I didn't stay at Lisa's house the other night. What drama that turned out to be! Popping pills... and boys for that matter! LoL! ANYWAYS.  Ed just asked me if we were still go camping tonight... and then said happy birthday. WHATEVER! Stop caring about getting fucked up, lol. AHHHH I found the cutest fucking picture in THE WORLD today. It is so beautiful... I started to cry. LoL! BIIIIG OGT! Its of two gay men with shirts that say ""DADDY"" on them.. and one of them is holding a baby boy, and his shirt says ""FAMILY"". Seriously, that is the cutest thing in the world. They were @ a pride parade. I want to go to one. OH! I need to go to a gay club. So someone come with me :) SO.. I guess we're gonna camp out tonight somewhere. That should be fun. I wish Lisa would go though :( But I don't think she wants to be around drugs... and I'm sure they'll be some there. Hmpf. And Kevin is sleeping over Lisa's tonight maybe? Or something like that. I don't know whats going on. I'm sure I'll find out later after I go to dinner with the family. I don't really want to roll tonight... or any night, lol. I mean, it was cool rolling. But its not like I have an urge to do it again. Oh well. We'll see what happens. MUHAHAHA. Anyways, I want to go do something cause I'm bored. Maybe I'll see if someone wants to go buy porn or scratch tickets! YAY! Or go buy my SCOOBY DOO BONG! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! I love scooby so much. I bought Scooby Doo macaroni and cheese today because its my birthday and I can have whatever I want. MUHAHAHA. OK. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME! YAY! WILD 18!"

"event","SUP?! Worked 9:30-2:30 today. Work hasn't been too bad lately. Like, I'm not going crazy for the last hour of my shift and watching the clock the whole time. Molly was there today! OOOOH I love her so much. Today was Scott's last day I think, so that really sucks cuz he's like the best checkout assistant. The parentals are home now... BLEH! Why can't they be away for like August? LoL. They want me to go see Jurassic Park III with them.. I'm all set thanks. I was suppose to go to a party with Christine, Matt, Shawn, and KC tonight... but I doubt we're goin cuz its 18+ so thats kinda sketchy seeing as 4/5 of the group isn't old enough. Oh well. Hopefully we'll find SOMETHING to do. I went tanning last night by the way. My face is all cleared up, yay. Its kinda red now. I don't think I like it. But! That does mean that I'm getting color. AND I think I'm red cuz I went for 15 min. and I haven't done that in forever cuz its always 3947329853743 degrees in the tanning building.  Seriously, school starts on Sept. 6 @ 2:00 PM. LoL. How funny is that. Orientaion @ our new building. I think its cuz parents are invited @ 5:30 to check it out with us. So its all good I guess. School is gonna be fucked up this year. I have been in the same old and small building for 3 years... and now I have to switch to a new building for my last year. I hope we (the seniors) still feel like we rule the school. Even though we've never been in it. LoL. I'm sure we will. I'm excited cuz I hope the new building will make us all happier and more school spirited. Cuz if you don't already know, my class has about this ------> . <------ much spirit. The fall is always so much fun @ school. Because I don't know. LoL. Homecoming and all those other dorky things make it exciting. I like Sprite too. I think that tonight we should all go to LIQUID or OZONE or Roller Skating or Cosmic Bowling. Bowling to me seems SO dorky. I feel dumb thinking about it, hehe. OMG! Seriously, I LOVE the Sara Evans version of the song THESE ARE THE MOMENTS. Her version is called I COULD NOT ASK FOR MORE. That was our prom song, except we had the original version by Edwin McCain... who is totally annoying. She sounds so much better, lol. Wild Country! It makes me all tingly inside. If anyone is reading this... I HIGHLY suggest that you d/l it NOW. Hehe, I'm gonna ask all you peeps, k? AIGHT! I wanna go watch a movie, but I doubt anything good is on. We have like a zillion channels now (hardly) and there is STILL never anything good on. The porn is even bad. OOOOOK, so I'm gonna go now. Gonna see what moms is up to. I feel the need for her to take me shopping ;) MUHAHAHAHA. Oh yeah, one more thing... bros before hos :) I love u. PEACE!"

"event","WHOA! I'm back baby. Haven't touched this journal since John 2 was still bitchy. Ok, so soooooooooooooo much shit has gone down since the last time I wrote. I really like writing here because I can bitch and talk and no one will care... cuz they don't have to read it if they don't want to. AND... I won't feel bad saying what I feel. WILD BITCH! SO... What do I want to talk about? OH! Well I I had a party the other night @ my house. It was OK I guess. Shelly didn't end up getting pills or anything.. so all there was, was alcohol. BLEH! I was tired already and didn't wanna drink it cuz I knew I would just get sleepy. Anyways... I picked up Matt and brought him to my house. Lisa, Christine, Shawn, Molly, Andy, and Adam were here! YAY. Matt and I have been hanging out since the Six Flags trip. He's chill. lol. WILD TUCKER! damn. Like, he's stayed over my house 3 times and we've gone to the movies too. I'm not sure whats gonna happen. We're just starting to become friends... so its not like I know if I want anything.. or if anything is there. YA KNOW? probably not. So... we stayed up til like 4 AM the other night/morning whatever talking. That was cool... cuz I haven't done something like that in a while. Anyways... he told me he liked me, I told him I liked him.  And its true, I like him... well, maybe I should say that I'm interested. Everyone says not to, but oh well. SO back to the party. We're at my party and Shawn, Matt, and Christine leave so that they can get drugs or something. COOL. But they're not back for like EVER. WHY? Because they're off getting high without everyone else. Cool. And then they come back and we all smoked. I was annoyed cuz Matt had called me the day before because he wanted to hang out... and so I invited him to my party, and then he didn't even talk to me. WILD IGNORED! And Shawn was like attached to his hip. I feel bad cuz he totally ignored Lisa and she went out of her way to bring him here... and then she had to bring him back too! And yeah... I guess Shawn likes Matt now or something? He should make up his mind. Because sending me e-mails that aren't suppose to make me feel bad... (yet they really do make me feel bad at first and I think that was the motive behind them)... aren't cool. It made me feel shitty, and it wasn't even my fault. This was the DAY AFTER I rolled and six flags trip. Its not fair to judge myself or my ""relationships"" on the basis of one day and night when I was fucked up. Sorry I couldn't control myself while I was rolling... and I shouldn't have to sit here and justify myself to ANYONE. The e-mail that he sent me was based solely on the events of that day... to me, its just not fair. AHHHH! I don't know what to do. So I guess I'll just lay low for a while, keepin it real on the DL. Maybe I should just let boys come to me if they want. And if they don't, then I won't bother with them. Then maybe I won't get judged so un-fairly. WILD BITCH! I feel so bitchy. Thats ok, everyone thinks that about me anyways. Snobby, bitchy, conceeded, cold, ETC. I'm sure the list is endless. Oh well. I'm use to it by now. And maybe thats why I act this way... because I've been through so much shit, that I just don't care. Cuz everyone knows I'm blunt and I'm not gonna let people walk all over me. They know who I am, so like it or leave it. If that makes any WILD SENSE. Maybe. So, fuckin I don't go to practice anymore. FAT. Its just so hard to wake up in the mornings. And this morning, lol, I was so emotional. Crying over a movie that I had already seen while eating my cookie crisp. HAHA. I started laughing at myself. GOD. What is wrong with me. Bleh. So I work 4-9 tonight coooooool. I hope we do something fun tonight. And I need to go tanning cuz I'm white as hell. Hells red, huh? Think. And I'm kinda excited for school to start, cuz we have a brand new $36 million dollar school, sweetass. Fingerprinting lunch here I come! MUHAHAHA. That will be da shit! WELL. Probably should go. I have more to say, but I don't want to type it. Call me and I'll just tell you. Hmmm, my nuts just scrunched all up. Thats fun. This morning I was watching them move through my boxers. WOW, why am I saying this? FUN. Thats why. Balls are weird. Lisa wants to see mine move. I'm not really that down with that. LOL. She needs a boy so she can look at his balls move. Ok, enough with WILD BALLS. I SAW AMERICAN PIE 2 last night @ chunkys. YAY. It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. There were like 4 really funny parts. And the rest of the scenes were just not funny. lol. Ok, I need to go do 950 more crunches. Kevin interrupted me after the first 50. That pisses me off, ruining my concentration. lol, hello, away message? sometimes! ok, buh bye."

"event","Hiiii... well it's 12:11 or something and I just woke up like 45 minutes ago. Last night I went to see the Fast and the Furious with Steve, Christine, and Danielle. It was soooo fucking goood. First we went all the way to Chunky's and then it was sold out. So then we had to drive all the way back to Somersworth to the movies. I was kinda tired all day/night yesterday and didn't say much. I hope they didn't think I was being snobby or something. Mono still sucks, even though I don't have it, the after effects will be around for a few months.  Anyways, after the movie got done, everyone was driving fast in the parking lot and on the road. So fucking funny. Then we went and got food, and they decided to go get high. Bleh. So we went to some back road and got high. That was my first time not being drunk when I did it. I didn't even get high though, so it was kinda dumb. And bugs were flying in the car and going down Steves shirt and Christines eyes. lol. fun. after we were done we drove back, and on the way home got pulled over! because danielle was driving and went over the yellow line or something. and she was totally fine. so they made us get out of the car and stand behind it. then they searched it. oooh, i was so cold. so obviously they found nothing and let us go. we went and got gas and then went to danielle's house and went to bed. Steve kissed me last night. hmmm. I don't know what to say about that. I mean, I was fine with it. But I'm still just hesitant with Steve. I don't want to get hurt again by him or someone else. And I know things are in the past, but I'm confused. We should talk about stuff, whatever stuff there is first. :)  Steve couldn't fall asleep and I woke up @ 4 am. So we both left and he brought me to my car @ his house and I went home and went to bed. Oh well, I guess it was fun all together. And it is sunny out now. gonna take a shower now... i wish someone was here to... oooh, nevermind."

"event","its fucking hot.  like 832947384 degrees? probably.  school was dumb today.  I showed up at 9 o'clock and then went to math class because i thought we were having a review... apparently not. we played cards and sat outside. well how dumb is that? very dumb.  I could have stayed home and slept! just wait, it gets better... then i go to chemistry. guess who isn't there? mr. brady. duh, so no review for chem, and a waste of time.  so erin and i left and went to her house and then to my house and then to the store to get supplies for our party last block.  so we watched ""finding forrester"" and ate food. what a wasted hot day.  now i'm at home and lisa stopped by and we looked at her yearbook. i'm scanning a picture of matt moreau, yay! ok well I think I am going to evil York tonight... we're not asking."

"event","Well, this is fun!  I have my own ""wild journal"" now all to myself, and I created myself too.  Ok, well today I went to school at regular time because we were going on a field trip to the beach. I was kinda tired getting up that early because I haven't had to get up that early in like 3 weeks.  So anyways, we left my school at 8 o'clock and went to the beach. Wow, I had so much fun today.  It took my mind off all the bullshit with John thats been going on.  Well, I worked on my tan and played with all my friends at the beach.  My cousin Andrea and my friend Johnny bought BONGS! lol, wild bongs. It was a fun day. When I got home from the beach I took a shower cuz I was all beachy.  Then I talked to Steve on the phone, and he was bitchy to me a little.  But I was nice, and I just needed to get some things off my chest. Because last night I could not fall asleep for like EVER because I was thinking about the recent events that just occurred.  Oh well, I wanna forget about that shit.  I just wanna be single and have fun this summer. Yeah, so I have this feeling today, and guess who I decide to talk to? John #1.  Yeah, I don't know why.  He's a cool guy I guess, but things were bad before. Definitely nothing is going to happen.  I'm hoping to meet new people and go to some fuuuun parties. And no, I am not using him for parties or anything like that.  I dunno, I just want to be happy.  Anyways, I have to go to my sisters lil kid graduation tonight @ 7 and I'm not really looking forward to that because its hot and I'm tired.  oh well, I'm being bitchy."

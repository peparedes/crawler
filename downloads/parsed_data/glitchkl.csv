"event","I'm living in Delaware because of my job for the summer.
I do quality checks for body shop at GM.
Let me tell you, it's not the best job out there but it does pay pretty well.
They had to train me how to weld so I know what to look for and what not.
OMG the welding gun gets so freaken hot that my hand was burning through my gloves!
Apprently you can get really dark from welding or being around people welding.
The blue light gives off UV rays and can cause blisters in the back of the eyes if you look at it without protection.  

Well anyway this is what I made in welding class insteed of actually doing the lessons they told me.

It's my doggie.  The whole time the guy kept looking at it while I was making and and was like ""What the hell is that""
me ""I don't know yet, I'm still figuring it out""

A couple of minutes later he came back and I was like ""I'll give it to you for a $1""
him ""haha, I wouldn't give you a $1 for that""

When I got done he came back and was like ""Oh wow, it looks like my dog, he's a 'something, I forgot what the kind of dog was.'
me ""I'll give it to you for $5""
him ""I'll just take it out of the trash when you leave""

We're not allowed to take stuff out so I had to throw it away.


They gave us our own welding helmet and I put this on


<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v287/glitchkl/helmet.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting""></a>


I found out that I'm the only guy out of the entire plant that has something on it.  
It's funny, I work along like guys guy were they're macho and manly and big.  Here I am with this helmet hoping not to get beat up or something :)
But they all just got a kick out of it.

Sometimes when I weld on the floor and this is what they see all the time, me smiling.
Sometimes whenI mess up, I just want to turn it upside down but can't."

We all went to the Corner Room for his dinner.
After that I made some drinks by at his room for everybody in a rice cooker pot :)

After getting a little tipsy, we armed wrestled and I won except when I tried against Kev.  

Ok, Kevin is really strong, he even beat ryan who has a longer arm and weight lifts almost everyday!

Well later that night we went to go play pool in the Corner Pocket and I did pretty well for myself being drunk and all.
For some reason I chalked Margo and she did it back to me and by the end of the night I had chalk all over me!


hehe, these pictures were from Kev's birthday dinner :D

I don't know why they were laughing, it wasn't like I put my finger in Beth's ear right before it was taken and smiling about it.



I also like this since we always hang out together!

awwww.... I'm gonna miss our group after this semester

I feel like we're family and that I'm the oldest brother because I watch after them all the time.
Kev would probably be in the middle because, he watches after beth and he's reserved.
Beth is the youngest, she's not as responsible as Kev but cute like little sister at times.

Oh, I'm going back to berks for a semester and comming back up in spring for graduation.
Just trying to save cost where I can,
cause I'm in business and that's how I roll : )"

"event","i went to the supply chain info. session cause i had to.  after all of the speakers talked about what they did in supply chain, they had this game where you shook hands with the speakers and if you're the 3 person to shake hands with a particular speaker you win $10.  
all of the students left the meeting when it was over and didn't shake hands with them, so i just started talking to them and the second person i talked to had the money.  so i won $10 which i used to take my honey out to lunch :)

but anyway, so i was talking to this lady about international sourcing and all of a sudden i found myself talking to 4 other people at the same time and with my teacher there listening to me too. 
i thought it was funny when one of the ladies said i had a very nice handshake.

this past friday i went to a party at justin's aprt.  i had fun for a little, i was mixing drinks the whole night!  i made drinks for everybody at the party!  i had 4 different kinds of drinks, one was my special, the pine apple, and one was a margarita mix, the other one was margarita mix with milk which tasted really good, and the last was a special mix for kev.  

afterwards we went tubing or ""Tubbing"" at tussy.  i thought it would be fun to go with some of my friends to do something other than the usually boring stuff. 

it was really fun going down really fast and in groups.  You would not believe how much more fun it was if you're drunk!!!
i couldn't stand up that well and i didn't even care what i said when one of the girls tried to cut in line!
this girl tried to cut in line with her friends and she just fell on her head!!!
i just pointed and laughed really hard and was like ""HAHA, YOU FELL ON YOUR HEAD!!!""
then kev kicked her tub away when she wasn't looking.

i was surprised how many people i knew that were there!  
it was a shit load of fun and all for a $1!

all and all it was a great night for me till we got back.

saturday night i went to go watch a movie at chambers with some people, they were showing asian horror films.  my friend kumnit and ryan came along which was fun.  while waiting for kumnit, ryan and i wrote YO in the snow at chambers.  it was big!  we would run and slid to write it!  
the movies were....... idk.
i'm not into those kinds of movies and i was really glad that ryan and kumnit came along too.  i just talked to kumnit and we were both like, ""what the hell is going on?!""

afterwards we went for tacos  at taco bell.  
i don't know why, but this past month i really really like eating tacos!
sigh.... i hope that the phase passes soon before i get fat :(

came back and yea.....
i don't even know what i did this time and i'm just tired of fighting all the time.
i've never fought with friends ever in my life!
i'm always so carefree and easy going that i don't get what's going on.

today i went to fight club mainly to watch.  there were already done and gone before i got there, but there were some russian kids doing stuff off the wall.  i tried to do some of the stuff that they did, but it was way to hard for me.  

came back to my room and picked up the flowers and gave them....

sushi is so expansive!
paid $5 for 6 little rolls of some good salmon and something else.  
and i still wasn't full.  but i did find that eel is really good!

on the way out, we saw the one japanese guy bowing to one of the customer as she was leaving saying ""thank you very much.""  
haha, that was so cool!
we didn't get that cause we were already leaving or they had something us???

after that we went to old navy where i needed to go look for a gift for neung, she's a girl in cambodia that we e-mailed back and forth.  i called so many people that know her to give me her size and couldn't get a hold of anybody, but it turns out she's extra small or small.  she's really skinny!  well compared to me especially cause i'm fat.
i also got something for my cousin in cali.

later that night i got cranium, kids version, for chris's family cause i was giving chris a present and also his brother kyle.  i didn't want to leave amanda and viccy not getting anything cause that would of been bad.

anyway tomorrow's the lan party at the high school and i need to clean out my comp.  OMG they're so bad there!
my friends would look through my computer when i'm not there and pretend they didn't when i come back!
i remember like 2 summers ago i had a 3 day party at my house and like 5 of my friends were huddled up around my comp looking at my old pictures and files!"

"event","Your view on yourself:
You are down-to-earth and people like you because you are so straightforward. You are an efficient problem solver because you will listen to both sides of an argument before making a decision that usually appeals to both parties.

The type of girlfriend/boyfriend you are looking for:
You are not looking merely for a girl/boyfriend - you are looking for your life partner. Perhaps you should be more open-minded about who you spend time with. The person you are looking for might hide their charm under their exterior.

Your readiness to commit to a relationship:
You are ready to commit as soon as you meet the right person. And you believe you will pretty much know as soon as you might that person.

The seriousness of your love:
You like to flirt and behave seductively. The opposite sex finds this very attractive, and that's why you'll always have admirers hanging off your arms. But how serious are you about choosing someone to be in a relationship with?

Your views on education
Education is less important than the real world out there, away from the classroom. Deep inside you want to start working, earning money and living on your own.

The right job for you:
You have many goals and want to achieve as much as you can. The jobs you enjoy are those that let you burn off your considerable excess energy.

How do you view success:
Success in your career is not the most important thing in life. You are content with what you have and think that being with someone you love is more than spending all of your precious time just working.

What are you most afraid of:
You are afraid of things that you cannot control. Sometimes you show your anger to cover up how you feel.

Who is your true self:
You are full of energy and confidence. You are unpredictable, with moods changing as quickly as an ocean. You might occasionally be calm and still, but never for long.

"event","so i've been working a lot but not so much after xmas because it won't be that busy anymore :D
the day before xmas eve i went to my cousin's house to play games untill 4 in the morning.  

xmas eve i was at my aunt's house playing games and just hanging out with everybody.  i got jumped on by the kids and a few tickle missles and they were off running away :)
drank somewhat and made everyting seemed fun!
when i got back home around 11 pm i went to go look for my mp3 player i got for my brother.  i was so happy when i saw it in the mailbox!!!
lol, instead of gift wrapping the mp3 player i just took left over wrapping paper and just taped it on the package :)
sigh..... i really suck at gift wrapping.

on xmas my brother was wrapping the gift we got our cousin sappy.  i told him i suck at gift wrapping and told him to do and he's like, ok it won't take me long cause i suck too.
i looked at the package and he left out my name!
that always happens when i go 50/50 on any present with my brother or sister!!!
so i wrote my name on it and we were off to my aunts house.
it's funny, my family is always late to anything but out of everybody i'm the only one who's punctual.
oh it makes me so mad when people tell me times to meet them but they're not even there!!!
then i call them and i'm like, where are you?
and there're like, what? oh i'm still a sleep.  
then i'm like, why did you tell me this time!
and they're like, cuase all my friends are usally like 30 mins late to everything.

i really hate waiting for people who planned the event when i'm already there or when they do this to me!

but anyway so we got there and they had a lot of food!
after eatting they were handing out presents 1 at a time and the present my brother and i got sappy she read it out loud as ""this is to sappy from chichi""
i yelled, AND FROM KUNNY!!!
my brother started laughing
sigh.... i don't get it

hehe, kev would lay on it and i would look for the leaks :)
that night beth, andrew and brad came with us and we went sleding around campus.  turns out that beth's trays were better on ice than the bags.  
but my bags kicked ass on steps tho!

didn't do much friday or can't really remember what i did.
saturday i headed over to jan's arpt. to stay there till monday night. 
it was cool, the people who live there were really nice and i helped them clean up the place.
it was funny watching everybody watching the fantastic 4 on my laptop in the aprt. 
kev came later that night and Don left us chicken which i warmed up later for us that night.
we almost had the whole aprt. to ourselves but phong, mui's sister, was spending winter break there.
at first i was like, awwwwww.... then she was pretty cool later on.  maybe cause we kept taking cheap shots at each other the whole time :)

sunday after waking up around 4 we walked to walmart to buy groceries and made temura that night and made a lot!  
it was really good and after we were done eatting we just watched batman begins while sitting on the couch.  hehe, that was a fun night!

Monday was my birthday!
kev and i made a late breakfest but with a lot of food!
hehe, it was mostly kev and i made him eggs the way i usally make it :D
it was so nice cooking in a kitchen with a bright room when the sun came through the big window!
after eatting kev gave me my birthday present!
Turns out that he made me gaara's sand container from his gourd that he grew at his house!
i remember him showing me the gourd over summer when they were starting to grow and everytime i visited over break, it just kept getting bigger.  
hehe, i love looking at :D

A couple of weeks ago I was studying in the culture lounge for my exam Saturday and Beth came in, I didn't even notice, and put on these cute little antenna things on my head that she made :D

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v287/glitchkl/antenna.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">


afterwards, we went jumping on the moon air house, something like that.  it was only us who were in it at the time and then shawn walked by and wouldn't stop watching me!
that freaked me out a bit.

after i was all done studying Kev, Will, Danielle and I went hicking up in the Nittany Mt.  I fell a couple of times, but not to bad :) 
When we got to the top, we could see all of State college!
When we were heading back down the mountain, Kev and I just ran all most of the way trying not to trip over a rock and other objects :)

some pictures that will took

i keep telling them i don't know when i'll be home or if i'll be even here.
sigh.... i really don't want to work but they need help, it sucks waking up at 6am.
i gave one of my boss my extra taco i got for my coworker who was already full.
me to my boss ""hey you want this taco""
boss ""where did you get it?""
me ""at this taco place called taco best""
boss ""what kind is it?""
me ""beef""
boss ""ummm......""
me ""come on, you know you want it.  it's dripping full of blended flavors and it's free""
boss ""ummmm.......""
as i shoved the taco closer to his face
boss ""ok, ok, i'll take it""
haha, in the morning when i'm not tired i'll probably think this is the most retarded post, but for now i'm running with it.
oh yea, they said in the summer they'll give me an admin job if i wanted it.  
there's no real admin job for what i want, so they'll have to make one up for me :)
they really don't want me to leave, so i guess that's a good thing.

urrr.... enough about work, so at 9 or 10 i'm leaving to deleware for another thanksgiving!
1 thanksgiving isn't enough, well nor is 2 or 3.  
yup, i'm gonna have 4, 4 thanksgivings!
the 4th one's gonna be with kev while watching batman begins!
should be fun!

"event","so for the past days i've been like ""so when are we going to sara's for thanksgiving"" or ""what should i bring to sara's thanksgiving?"" sara is my brother's girlfriend.  everytime i said that to him he would just be like ""haha, oh shut up.  stop being retarded""  well he told sara and was like, ""you want to come up?""
i told him i didn't want to and he knew it too.
so today in the hospital in my dad's room he was like ""so daddy, kunny's going to come with me to sara's family thanksgiving in wilkesberry""  
i was like ""WHAT?!  i didn't want to go, i won't know anybody there!""
my dad was like ""go, go with your brother""

so yea, after thanksgiving with my family, my brother and i headed to wilkes around 3:30pm to sara's house.  
i couldn't believe i was going, i usally back out of stuff like that.
when we got to the house at like 5 or so, there were so many people there!!!
i didn't know anybody!
there were only like 3 people close to my age which they were old by 4 or 5 years differents.  
it was mostly like familys apond familys.  
so many people!
sara's dad kept making me martini's and yea, i'm such a light weight my body got really hot and stuff.

everybody was like ""you two are like the comic dual"" to me and my brother.
lol, we're really funny together when we make fun of people!

this one girl was like ""so how do you know each other?""
i was like ""ummmm..... we're brothers""
she said i had a longer face and something with my nose so that we didn't look like it.
lol, i would of thought if you see 2 asian guys in a house full of white people that they would automatically think they're related.  i know i would.
but it was ok, she was the only other minority there.

oh i meant the best bartending of the 1980's!  
his daughter kept telling her dad to make me a drink and i almost had one till sara's dad was like ""i'll make it for you!""
lol, so many rich drinks that i'm not used to.

if you ever want a martini i know how to make one now!

well by the end of the night i was having a crap load of fun talking to everyone!
not just like 3 people, i mean i talked to EVERYONE that night!
there had to be over 50 people easily!
lol, my brother talked on the phone with his girlfriend just now and he said that they think i'm really nice and that they liked me and want me to come back again!
infacted they wanted us to sleep over!

Yay ME!!!
you just can't hate me and if you do, you're probably a bastard that nobody likes :)
but yea, it was a lot of fun going out of my norm and experiencing that.
it'll be so much easier now going back since they all know me :D

well 2 thanksgiving down, 2 more to go!!!
i'm going to Delaware for another thanksgiving with my family, but it's gonna be bigger!
then sunday day, oh yea, sunday

Wichitah
 	

I don't have my own office at ETHOS, the company i am rotating at.  I usually take whoever's desk depending on who's out for the day.  I usually am in one that is shared.  But this morning I got Dr. Katz' office, my preceptor.  He sits in a single office that is just him.  Thank god that he's out today.  I had a big bowl of cereal and a nice sized piece of cheese this morning.  Anyone that knows me knows how I am with dairy.  Anyway, his leather office chair is taking a beating with the farts that I'm ripping into it. 

It actually gets so nauseating I had to open the window.  It is freezing in his office, but it also stinks like wrotting cheese.  I have been having gastro problems all morning and it's been about 3 hours and going.  I feel like i'm running in a marathon where i'm like, ok 20 more and i'm done, except I don't know if it's 20 more, at this point I have no more control over this matter.

so many good memories and i was free to do what i wanted, i would never lock the door unless i was going home.
almost everybody in the hall knew me and my neighbors were cool as hell.
they would always say i'm nice or to turn up my musics, stuff like that and showed me their girlfriends when they were over.

<p><font color=""#df20df"" face=""Century Gothic"" size=""2"">If your eyes follow the movement of the rotating pink dot, you will only see one color, pink. </font></p>
<p><font color=""#df20df"" face=""Century Gothic"" size=""2"">If you stare at the black + in the center, the moving dot turns to green. </font></p>
<p><font color=""#df20df"" face=""Century Gothic"" size=""2"">Now,
concentrate on the black + in the center of the picture. After a short
period of time, all the pink dots will slowly disappear, and you will
only see a green dot rotating. </font></p>
<p><font color=""#df20df"" face=""Century Gothic"" size=""2"">It's amazing
how our brain works. There really is no green dot, and the pink ones
really don't disappear. This should be proof enough, we don't always
see what we think we see. </font></p>

You dislike conflict, and you've been able to rise above the angst of the world.
And when things don't go your way, you know they'll blow over quickly.

Easygoing, you tend to find joy from the simple things in life.
You roll with the punches, and as a result, your life is light and cheerful.

You find it easy to adapt to most situations, and you're an open person.
With you, what you see is what you get... and people love that!

A Nerd is someone who is passionate about learning/being smart/academia.<br>
A Geek is someone who is passionate about some particular area or subject, often an obscure or difficult one.<br>
A Dork is someone who has difficulty with common social expectations/interactions.<br>

You scored less than half in all three, earning you the title of: <b>Joe Normal</b>.
<br><br>
This is not to say that you don't have some Nerd, Geek or Dork inside
of you--we all do, and you can see the percentages you have right
above. This is just to say that none of those qualities stand out so
much as to define you. Sure, you enjoy an episode of <i>Star Trek</i>
now and again, and yeah, you kinda enjoyed a few classes back in the
day. And, once in a while, you stumble while walking down the street
even though there was nothing there to cause you to trip. But, for the
most part, you look and act fairly typically, and aren't much of an
outcast.
<br><br>
I'd say there's a fair chance someone asked you to take this test. In any event, fairly normal.
<br><br>
Congratulations!

"event","I'm back at school and all settled in.  I have a roommate this semester cause I wanted to have someone to talk to, but he's even more quieter than me!  At first I really didn't like him much, but we're starting to get better.  Oh! I notice that he watches a lot of cartoons that are the same shows I watch!  
Yesterday he was like ""Hey, you like anime right?  Well I just got this anime magazine at the comic shop, you wanna look at it?""  

That was cool of him, but at other times he watches sprots on tv while he's on his comp playing a basketball game.  The tv's  loud and also his computer, which he has 5 speakers and a huge base, is also turned up.

My classes so far seems terrifying!
I'm currently taking 6 classes and 4 of them in the 400 level.  I'm thinking of minoring in Supply Chain & IST, but that would mean another year.  I'm thinking of doing it cause it would land me a better job with a higher pay or just makes me look better then just accounting.
I'm thinking of going to grad school, but I really don't know. 

Ok, I have to get reading before my next class.
Oh, I'm also in Hamilton this year so stop by and visit me!"

"event","so i just bought a laptop! :D

i origionally ordered the dell inspiron 9300, that's the one with the 17"" screen.
it was pretty nice the way i had it set up with all the upgrades, but i was rethinking about it.  it would be really big for me to take around or put in my bag if i was gonna take it somewhere. 

so i called and decided to cancel it and went with the dell inspiron 6000.  
put some upgrades and think this would be better for me.  the only bad thing is that i only put in 512 ram instead of 1 gig that i had in the 9300 and that i won't have a 128 video card.  

i did get a really good deal tho!
if i did it online it would of been $1650 then the deal of the week discount which came out to $1400 for the final price without shipping or the printer.
the way i did it with the same comfig my price came out to be $923.40!
with a free printer wich i upgraded and a extra 10% off with an even bigger dell discount of the week!
hehe, yea i'm happy :D

Kevin's comming today at 6pm!!!
then we're gonna head to DC for a day then to balitmore for the weekend for otakon!"

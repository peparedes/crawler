A very bad burglar, apparently. Totally unarmed, responds to commands normally reserved for naughty dogs (which was the only thing my sleep-crusty brain could muster at the time). And from a house strewn with iPods, laptops and various videogame consoles, all he managed to nab was my filthy, empty purse. 

Hope you enjoy my hairbrush and my T pass, fucko. Christ."

"event","So, in honor of Talk Like a Pirate Day (9.19), my next Found Footage Friday is going to be pirate-themed. I've got a few things in mind: the Sifl and Olly ""pirate cripplers""; the Lazytown pirate song; perhaps a little Pirates of Darkwater for the anime space-fairy pirate angle; and I definitely want to address the pirate-versus-ninja subculture clash.

But you guys are definitely authorities on scurvy bilge rats, etc. -- if anyone were to know about some good, weird material, it'd be ye, me hearties. Got any recommendations?

Also, I'm trying to track down clips from Terry Gilliam's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crimson_Permanent_Assurance"">The Crimson Permanent Assurance</a>, but it's bloody hard. Enormous to brownie points to anyone who has leads on that."

"event","Last Tuesday, my terrible six-week-long jury duty stint finally came to an end. The intervening days have dulled my bile to a dull throb, so this won't be quite the spittle-flecked rant I've been writing in my head for the past month. (Thank god.)

To sum up:

Originally, the case (a frightfully dull shoving match between a <a title=""novice building contractor"" href=""http://www.longbaymgt.com"">novice building contractor</a> and an <a title=""architect"" href=""http://www.dhkinc.com"">architect</a>) was supposed to go for two weeks, which somehow snowballed into six. SIX WEEKS of attorneys haranguing witnesses about the minutiae of fire sprinklers. A rather poor strategy, considering that, as it turns out, sprinklers had nothing to do with the actual juror instructions. (I'm sure the prosecution was hell-bent on mashing the emotional buttons of this young, white, 85% female jury with their ""OMG People Could Die In Fires, Isn't That Awful, Ladies?"" shtick; but in the end, their dithering only bit them in the ass.)

I've already <a title=""indulged a little"" href=""http://weeklydig.com/index.cfm/issueID/1921cb9f-c9ac-414d-9d68-8db313a28c10/fuseaction/Article.view/issueID/1921cb9f-c9ac-414d-9d68-8db313a28c10/articleID/d10c04c6-6514-42b3-ac7a-a9f2b2951ae7/nodeID/03db94a1-15d0-443d-a7a3-1eab00dc5a6a"">indulged a little</a> (scroll down), but allow me to present:

<lj-cut text=""The Big Book of Ways that Jury Duty Can Make

-It's not like the paper stopped coming out, so I had to work around it, causing me to put in 12-16-hour days (JD and Dig combined) for over a month. (Such hours are not uncommon, but a little tough to stomach all in row like that, especially when combined with ""homework"" afterward.)

-But my absence was still causing problems, so Joe went and HIRED A NEW GUY -- my arch-nemesis, an actual trained copyeditor -- to help out as a freelancer. AAAAAARGH. (<lj user=""mdm-sosostris"">, I must say, you've done my heart a lot of good; to know him as the Lizard makes him much less terrifying.)

-During the second-to-last week of JD, the Dig was in the frantic throes of finalizing our web launch, facing the departure of two staffers (out of 10), and we were racing to put out a normal-sized issue in THREE DAYS. Ugh.

-That same week -- when the judge suddenly discovered that, due to incredibly botched time management, the case might not wrap up before July -- I was forced to defend my vacation on the spot, with no warning. In COURT, no less, in front of the judge, lawyers and witnesses. (Eventually, it was decided that I could take my vacation so that juror #1 could go to a wedding; meanwhile, poor juror #10 opted to postpone her trip to Hawaii, on the court's tab. No guilt there, eh?)

***</lj-cut>

On Tuesday, after 12 hours of deliberation, we delivered the verdict, thus ending six weeks of living on sleep fumes, cortisol and rageahol. Good fucking riddance.

It's been wonderful to return to the regularly scheduled program of intraoffice loutishness (christ, I missed it). And to my ever-supportive co-workers and the ultra-tolerant <lj user=""uridium"">, I owe my undying gratitude -- as well as all my hair, which would have fallen out in clumps completely, were I not able to constantly vent my spleen all over them.

Next up: Happy Fun-Time Vacation in NYC."

"event","Perhaps ... <i>perhaps</i> deciding to take the plunge and finally learn to ice-skate was not such a good idea when preceded by so many white russians. But yay for crashing WBUR Christmas parties. If I'm going to get (ever so slightly) schnockered and hurt myself, I might as well do it on a nonprofit organization's tab. Am I right? Oh, yes.

So, the previously scheduled itinerary for the night -- ""Work like mad"" -- has been supplanted by ""Take expired aspirin, gingerly arrange self on couch, and work like half-mad."" Feh.

PS: Ice-skating is awesome! I can't believe I haven't done it before (especially when my bones were young and spongy). And seeing ex-'BUR compadres was (at worst) surreal, and (at best) wildly pleasant.

PPS: The ""sad hamster"" icon was the result of an image search for this week's crossword puzzle guest host -- a <a href=""http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/12/10/0644249"">hamster with seasonal affective disorder</a>. I had so much fun (and so little sleep) making it. The science seems a little dubious to me ... but the idea of testing hamsters for depression by tossing them into buckets of water is so Python-esque. Outstanding."

"event","So, that flag football tournament just didn't work out. Turns out, media types aren't generally real keen on grappling other pale, sweaty media types on some godforsaken frozen field in the middle of November (looking at you, Ty Burr).

What a relief.

Instead, the Dig's turning our annual Christmas party into an big-ass <a href=""http://www.brattlefilm.org"">Brattle</a> benefit -- or, as Ho-Ag so poetically put it, ""a cheese log of confusion."" We've got a bunch of bands, and they'll all be doing renditions of holiday favorites. So far, we've confirmed:
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.thekonks.com"">The Konks</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.ecbeats.com"">The Eclectic Collective</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.ho-ag.com"">Ho-Ag</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://unlockedgroove.com"">Unlockedgroove</a>'s DJs Mike Uzzi and Heemin Yang</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.coffeestainmusic.com"">Josh Lederman Y Los Diablos</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.slimjimmusic.com"">Slim Jim & The Mad Cows</a></li>
<li>The Bello Project</li>
<li> ... and my personal favorite, <a href=""http://www.djbc.net/mashes"">DJBC</a> from the Indo's Mash Ave. -- check out his site; the Christmas mashups are a lot of fun (so far, I'm really liking <a href=""http://www.solcofn.com/media/Christmas/03pojmasta-santarklaws.mp3"">""Santar Klaws""</a> and <a href=""http://www.solcofn.com/media/Christmas/02djjohn-thechristmasmassacreofcharliebrown.mp3"">""The Christmas Massacre of Charlie Brown""</a>)</li>
</ul>
So, yeah, it's a pretty crazy lineup. Plus, we've got the usual: food, booze, our most charming selves, and a horde of surly Santas-for-hire.

It all goes down at the BCA's Cyclorama (<a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?q=539+Tremont+St.,+Boston&iwloc=A&hl=en"">539 Tremont St., Boston</a>) on Wednesday, December 14. Doors open to the public at 7:30pm. 21+/$10 a head.

An incredibly painless way to try to keep Harvard Square from spiraling further into a dead-eyed wasteland of consumer whoredom. Looks like it'll be an all-around good time, really. Hope to see some of you there!"

Apparently, she and her students spent an hour huddled in the classroom with the lights off, not making any noise, since the administration suddenly announced a ""lockdown"" without any explanation of the situation. (""Lockdown,"" in this case, seems to be a post-Columbine, post-9/11 procedure created in case of an armed assailant roaming the halls.) Nobody -- outside of the principal's office -- knew about the anthrax angle until their dismissal, four hours later.

On its face, it's already a ridiculous story ... but the true absurdity lurking below the surface is just staggering. Only, it's a long, convoluted story ... and my mom tells it so much better than I do.

Too bad they don't make one of <a href=""http://www.giantmicrobes.com/mofcart/orderform.html"">these</a> in anthrax -- I'd love to give it to her as a Christmas gift."

Suffice it to say, the whole ""planning process"" hasn't come along very far.   Heh. I should probably get on this.

On a less self-absorbed note, <a href=""http://coolidge.org/s_events.html#texas"">this</a> is what prompted this conversation. A Coolidge <i>TCSM</i> screening, complete with an appearance by Gunnar Hansen (who'da thought ol' Leatherface was so hot?) and a live performance of the soundtrack. Now, I'm a big fan of the original soundtrack, but it's hard to beat watching a movie with a live score. Oh, yes. I am so there. November 12, baby! Who's with me?

I hate to say it, but this is probably one of the reasons the Brattle's suffering so bad. Until they're done fucking around with obscure French whatevahs, I'll be at the Coolidge. I mean, the Brattle does great stuff and all, but they would never have a nunsploitation night. (No, <i>Pony Trouble</i> does not count. <i>Pony Trouble</i> never counts.)

Aw ... Don't get me wrong; I still have a big ol' soft spot for the Brattle. Hey, we're even organizing a charity flag football tournament  for them (what a drunken scrum <i>that's</i> going to be)."

Why don't you have more women on your masthead? It's kind of lame that there are no women on your editorial staff, whatsoever, except a copyeditor (!) ... and I think it's reflected in your copy. I've been reading the Dig off and on since moving to Boston about seven months ago, and I've noticed that your mag, while it can be funny, can also have a ""male"" sense of humor that is, to me, borderline--or just patently--offensive. When reading sometimes I feel like I'm listening in on a bunch of guys hanging out (and who are still in high school) ... even articles written by women seem to be directed toward a male audience. At any rate, it's lame and it makes me want to read your magazine less. Where are the women??

Subject: YOUR SEARCH IS OVER


Oh, Lynne...

Thank <i>god</i> you stood up and said something about the testosterone imbalance here at the <i>Dig</i>. With all the sexist banter and catcalls being flung around the office, I can barely hear myself ovulate! Everyone's too busy scratching themselves and grunting and smoking their enormous phallic cigars to even bother to ask me about my feelings! You know, it wouldn't kill them to throw me a simple ""Hey, how's the flow, Shaula?"" every once in a while.

Jesus, I can't even begin to imagine what you were trying to accomplish with your condescending drivel. Are you implying that the position of copyeditor is somehow too trivial to even be included on the masthead? Or perhaps too trivial to be featured in this month's edition of <i>Women's Business Boston</i>? Well, fuck you and the Mother Earth Goddess you rode in on.

I've been with the <i>Dig</i> since I was 18 years old (that's going on five years now, babe), and I think that's long enough to be able to appreciate how gender-blind the Dig is. This might sound crazy to you, but our hiring decisions appear to be based on merit, rather than sex chromosomes.

Now, I wish I could spend more time vivisecting your thoughtful e-mail, but I really should slap on my apron and get back to Windexing the glass ceiling.

Insufferable bitches like you make me cringe in shame.

Anyone care to forfeit two hours of their lives to utter schlock?

"event","Today, my (copy)editing style was affectionately described as ""cunty."" Am unsure whether to be temporarily ashamed or secretly pleased. (Say it with me now, <lj user=""uridium"">: <i>Why can't it be both?</i>)

I wonder if I should be concerned about my parents' reactions when they excitedly flip to my section of the gift guide -- one of the few long-ish pieces I've ever published -- and discover that the first sentence contains the word ""pubes."" Also, I wonder if they'll notice the piece right next to it, a holiday guide to sex toys chock-full with rather alarming descriptions of Mrs. Claus' fondness for ass play.  

Maybe I shouldn't have gotten my dad a subscription to the Dig for Christmas. 

Sometimes -- considering I get paid to write about bondage, and liberally use words like ""cocksucker,"" and dig up smutty pictures -- I feel like I'm living a Bill Hicks sketch ... which I will reproduce for your enjoyment <lj-cut text=""here:"">here:

<b>TIME FOR A QUESTION

Boy, my folks are proud of me! 

""Bill, honey, you still doin' that suck-your-own cock bit?"" 

""Yeah, mom."" 

""Good, baby, 'cuz that's such a crowd-pleaser. How clever 'a you to come up with the suck-your-own cock bit, honey. So clever, it just makes yo' mama's bosoms <i>swell</i> with pride. Knowing her son is travelin' the world, usin' his given surname, goin' out in rooms of total strangers, and doin' the SUCK-YOUR-OWN-COCK PIECE."" 

""Thanks, Mom."" 

""No biggie ... 

"" ... Bill, honey, you still doin' that eat-the-pussy piece?"" 

""Yeah, Mom --"" 

""--Great!

""You know, son, many people at Sunday school ask me when you're going to be performing in the area. Bill, they're always so curious to see the material you're doin' now, and they're aaaaaaaaaall sure they want to see the suck-your-own cock bit, followed by the eat-the-pussy sketch! Bill, I only wish your grandparents were still alive ... to see their own grandson, onstage, usin' his given surname, performin' the suck-your-own-cock bit, <i>PLUS the pussy-eatin' sketch</i>."" 

""Maybe they're hearin' it in Heaven, Mom."" 

<i>(pause)</i>

""... Son, is there any way I could ask you to ... type up the SUCK-OWN-COCK BIT, and pin it to your grandmomma's headstone?""</b></lj-cut>"

"event","Finally, my weeks of devoted <i>Globe</i> Fun Pages reading (because what's a better way to kick off a Sunday morning than brutally ripping apart some 8-year-old's poem about her doggie?) have finally paid off. Now, if you showed up for our Halloween party, chances are good that I thrust this in your face at some point. But this is beautiful enough to share twice. I mean, how often do you come across such a vitiolic condemnation of ... candy? Way to go, kid.

Now, straight from the chocolate-smeared pen of Augustus Gloop, I present to you:

<i><b>Fun Size Candy is NOT Fun</b></i> 

""For those of you never blessed to come in contact with fun size candy, let us explain. This is candy that has been made smaller and has the words ""fun size"" slapped on it so people will think it's some hot new thing. This Halloween, we say fun size candy is no fun.

""This marketing ploy to make smaller candy look new and exciting hurts kids the most. We want nothing more than to come to your doorstep and beg and shriek for candy. Imagine our sadness to find a mere shaving of chocolate inside the wrapper.

""All children look forward to trick-or-treating and Halloween. It's fun to dress in costume but the bigger reward is a nght full of candy. Fun size candy takes away at least half the fun. It's literally like taking candy from a baby.

""So, grown-ups (who buy the Halloween candy), please listen to our advice. If you find yourself looking at fun-size candy in the store, keep walking. <b>Fun size candy is the devil's work.</b> Instead, look for king size candy, the spirit of America's Halloween, and buy as many of those as you can. Get in the Halloween true spirit and make us kids happy."""

So, tell me why I should write about them. 

I've already done a bit of research, so I'm not putting this forth in complete ignorance; I just wanna hear it from the fans. Or, tell me why they're a posse of pretty-boy posers.

There is nothing like wrapping up a month of high anxiety with <a href=""http://www.kmfdm.net"">a night of socially acceptable violence</a>, set to the songs that championed my high school angst (plus a few newer, less anthemic ones, which were notcieably lacking that ""oh-my-god-I've-been-waiting-eight-years-to-hear-that-live"" oomph).

Bonus: The bass and the volume were jacked up so high, the few moments bereft of shoving and thrashing were akin to the experience of sitting on a dryer -- an INDUSTRIAL dryer of course! Ha. ha. ha?

"event","Now, normally, I don't give into the temptation to post the reults of retarded online quizzes. But this one is just so ... well, it almost sounds like an intervention. You know, a wake-up-call, because it sounds pretty bad, and yet, I can see it. Wait, I'm reading too much into an Internet quiz. Maybe I do need an intervention. 

Available <a href=""http://hokev.brinkster.net/quiz/default.asp?quiz=Better+Relationship&page=1"">here</a>.

<lj-cut text=""You are a RSYT--Reserved Sentimental Physical Taker. This makes you a Brute."">
<font color=""#FF0000"">eXpressive: 5/10
Practical: 4/10
Physical: 5/10
Giver: 2/10 

You are a RSYT--Reserved Sentimental Physical Taker. This makes you a Brute.

You are volatile, stormy and incredibly sexy. You have a hungry, fascinating way about you. You are a riot when you're happy and a menace when you're angry. You are strangely appealing to your target sex, and they find themselves drawn in despite their wiser instincts. 

In your professional life, your type makes you a star, a force to be reckoned with, and the one people trust when they have a problem that's beyond them. In a relationship, you are a bull in a china shop, and if your partner isn't clever s/he may get plowed down. I could warn you to be more communicative with and sensitive to your partner, but that's just not going to happen. You don't ask much of your significant other, so you have no tolerance for high demands on you. For you, it's either love it or leave it. 

You work hard and play hard. You enjoy a good drink. You have had many lovers and will have many more. People try and fail to get you into bed. They want you for a friend and fear you as an enemy. 

This may not sound too flattering, but the truth is that because you know yourself so well you're happier in a relationship than most everybody else. 

Hemingway would write about you. Maybe Hemingway is you.

Of the 102057 people who have taken this quiz, 2.8 % are this type.</font>

I dunno, it starts off so promising, and then kind of peters out toward the end, especially that ""work hard, play hard"" paragraph. I don't think those poor delerious guys that hang around the Pine Street Inn count as proof of my raging seductiveness. And, boy, I am so <i>not</i> feared by anybody (except maybe <lj user=""uridium"">, who's forced to endure the brunt of my volatility). Believe me, if there's one emotion I would like to instill in people, it would be fear -- terror, even -- but the best I can do is frustration. And possibly mild revulsion.

As a side note, I think the last question (which was hitting-related, I believe) pushed me right over the edge into brute-dom.</lj-cut> 

Well, I do believe that just ate up the yawning chasm of time I've spent here, waiting for disgruntled people to call me. Thanks, Internet!"

"event","From <a href=""http://www.industrial-music.com/product.php?prodnum=DSBP+1045"">Metropolis Records'</a> <a href=""http://www.krushedopiates.com/"">Krushed Opiates</a> promotional blurb: 

""This is the debut CD from the hard rocking, aggressive electro dance group known as Krushed Opiates! Old-school, hard industrial, coldwave influences, and electro technoid dance combine here on a very fun, and impressionable trip. Fifteen tracks over 70 minutes of music to get down to. Fans of Swamp Terrorists, Biopsy, and Chem-Lab will feel the love, as will all true industrial fans, not scared of some good ole heavy sounds! <b>The music of the infamous D. Smith who is currently serving time for creating the ''Melissa virus'' a few years ago.</b> Hardcore!""

Hardcore indeed. 

Actually, these guys are really cool. I emailed them to ask about a sample they used in ""Casey."" Back in the day (2002, before I became a Mad Hole denizen, even!), I was kind of obsessed with the song and finding out the origins of that damn piano riff sample, but I had kind of forgotten about it. That is, until I heard it (the sample, not Krushed Opiates) being used as the background to a <i>This American Life</i> piece on Sunday. ""D"" from KO responded to me within a matter of hours, which is pretty cool, considering that they're underground Industrial internet radio superstars ( ... um ... ). So check 'em out; they've got a bunch of MP3s on their site.

Speaking of Metropolis Records promotional blurbs, I'd just like to announce that <a href=""http://www.batterycage.com"">Battery Cage</a> has finally released <i>World Wide Wasteland</i>. <a href=""http://www.industrial-music.com/artist.php?artist=Battery+Cage"">This album</a> is amazing, and I'm not just saying it because I lived with Paul (the guy who humps his Virus throughout the album) for a year. Well, maybe that's a small factor -- but I defy you to tell me that ""Anti/Angel"" isn't an instant classic. Even better: According to the buzz, those boys are coming back to Boston to do a show in January. Sweeeeeet.

(By the way, the mystery sample is from a song called ""On the Plume,"" which appeared on the <i>Erin Brockovich</i> soundtrack, as well as the <i>Matchstick Men</i> preview.)"

"event","We have a new intern. She just started last Thursday - or rather, her former department got sufficiently exasperated with her last Wednesday, and decided to cram her in our department. With the addition of Crystal the Bubbly Lapdog to our current lineup of Jibbah-Jabbah the Excitable Israeli, OCD Boy and Soni the Incredible Back-Stabbing Fashion Nugget, our three-ring circus is complete.

Reproduced here is a sample of the ambient conversation I had to endure last week between our new all-star and fellow Intern Corral buddy (note: I am not participating here, just transcribing):

""Like, what would be the coolest job you could ever possibly imagine? I mean, like, in the field of journalism. I mean, not like sitting on your couch eating chips or something - ""

""--I really don't consider that 'cool'.""

""Well, I mean, like petting ponies while skydiving out of an airplane or something.""

""Well, I would like to write for a nationally recognized newspaper. That would be cool. How about you?""

""I want to do something, you know, like artsy or something. Or volunteer in some country like, I dunno, Borneo. You know they have this program where you can be a surrogate mother to monkeys. Or working with children. I want to do lots of things, but not just to make money. So I would need some support, like from my boyfriend...""



Just to make it clear: I didn't make <i>any</i> of that up."

How to make an instant cult classic: Combine ample portions of dead-sexy (make that deadly) martial arts bombshells, generous splashes of amazing Technicolor bloodshed and a sizzling soundtrack. Shake violently. Bam! The Coolidge has wasted no time in giving Tarantino's latest gore-soaked epic the cult treatment, with midnight showings of Kill Bill. For the first time, you'll have the opportunity to see both chapters of this slick saga, back to back, as Quentin originally intended. No doubt this will spark intense debate over whether Kill Bill would have been better as one whopping saga of betrayal and killing and revenge and killing and passion - and killing. And if you're a choosy bastard, you can stick with either <i>Vol. 1: Let's Slay Us Some Yakuza, With Swooooords!</i>, or <i>Vol. 2: As The World Turns, With Swooooords!</i>. Midnight showings tonight and Saturday. 290 Harvard St., Brookline. 617.734.2500. $9 ($6 members). <a href=http://www.coolidge.org>www.coolidge.org</a>, http://killbill.movies.go.com

"event","<FONT COLOR=""0000FF"">HamsofThree:</FONT> DAVID, 17, SHAULA, 17, J.R., 17, and PETER, 17, walk happily down a typical Knoxville, Tennessee sidewalk, flanked by large buildings. The sun is shining on this warm, sunny day. They pass by a glass-window convention center, purposely blocking the sidewalk for people coming the other direction. As they walk down the street, J.R. notices something behind a bush near the side of a building. He and Peter walk over, and return with a box about the size of a one of a gigantic textbook. J.R. opens it. Inside is a ham. It's not a nice ham, in fact, it seems to have spawned a variety of plant and animal life, but it is wrapped in paper. There is no telling how long it has been there, no expiration date. The four of them look at the ham, completely dumbfounded, then look at a parking garage not two hundred feet away. They all smile knowingly. The ham, were it still a pig, would be cowering in fear. Instead, it just sits there. J.R. closes the box and hides it back behind the bush, and they depart.

<FONT COLOR=""0000FF"">HamsofThree:</FONT> Four hours later, they arrive back at the parking garage, ham box in hand, and traverse the steps up to the fourth floor. The wind seems a bit stronger up here, almost foreboding. Each of them takes turns snapping pictures of the others, so everyone can be left with a permanent memory of the event. They make ridiculous poses for the cameras, and hold up the ham box proudly. Then, as everyone looks over and prepares, J.R. opens the box for one last look at the ham, salutes it proudly, and dumps it right over the edge. As it falls, the paper billows and finally shoots outward, almost resembling wings, soaring the ham into its final resting place. The ham hits the ground, with a loud BANG, about the volume of a quiet gunshot, then ricochets quickly to the side, out of sight.

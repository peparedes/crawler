"event","So after Steph and Damion dropped me off after having lunch with them at the Boston Market and I got a call from my boss saying that I need to come in and he needs to talk to me, and that it's an emergency.  I thought it was kinda odd sense he said that I didn't need to bother dressing for work.  So I hesitate and come to the Annapolis Mall and and see Mr. Keever, the loss prevention guy for the east coast.  Keever, Fred, and Frank all tell me that they need to talk to me in the same room where we all talked about Tom's incident from a few months back.  When we get there Keever starts to shuffle some of his cards while staring and analayzing me and then says to me ""Frank tells me that you just bought some kind of new gameboy, how much did that run you?""  I tell him that it's $150 and he comes back and says ""that's funny because a little over $165 was missing from the register a few days back, would you have any idea where that came from?"" I stare at him blankly and tell him that I have no idea what he's talking about.  Frank then comes in with his usual angry high pitched voice and says ""Then why did another two assoc. say that they saw you pocket the money!?"" ""I don't fucking know."" As soon as I said that the door knocked and Detective Cooley came in and pretty much repeated all of what Keever said i guess trying to get another kind of answer out of me.  They all left the room and Cooley pretty much said ""Look, this is what's going to happen to you, you can get up to a year in prison, and/or a $10,000 fine, but I can't save you any money on your car insurence!"""

"event","Today:
Ah going to vendor training leaves such a bitter sweet taste in my mouth.  I mean it's nice not having to do any real work.  Also Mike H. was there and I havn't really talked to him sense high school and before he dropped off the face of the earth.  It was good catching up with him.  Also the sony rep. gave me a flask, a flask that said ""sony"" on it it was. . . random.  But then sucks because I'm there from 8-5:30 completely not paying any attention to anyone talking an getting paid next to nothing, and I have to drive to Martin's Crosswinds down 295 during rush hour both ways. 

Tomorrow:
Work morning then go to Chris', then to Dave's house and then probably back to stay at Chris' over night.

Then:
Nintendo DS ::crosses fingers::

Near Future:
Thanksgiving <i>YAY</i>

Later:
Black friday and the following month <i>Boo!</i>"

Everyone laughed and thats fine, and there were little jokes about it for about another 40 minutes or so until this other kid says after the teacher describes how whoever found out about the DNA strand ""oh isn't that movie with the flying brains about that"" and i just look at him and go ""Thank you for taking the pressure off of me!""  It was good times.

-Halo 2 at a friends house that I havn't talked to in over 4 years with almost everyone from the local pizza hut is the beez kneez.

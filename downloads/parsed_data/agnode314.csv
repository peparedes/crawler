Alumni from Encinal High School Class of 2000 are participating in a Class Reunion Website at http://classreport.org/usa/ca/alameda/ehs/2000. There are no registration fees required to join in the fun. Each class member has full participation privileges.

This Class-Based Reunion Website features dynamic changing content daily. Stop in to view current Class News. Exchange opinions and stay up to date with the Message Board. View the Featured Alumni Biography of the day. Send a birthday greeting to a class member listed in the Upcoming Birthdays panel. Reunion Announcements, Book and Movie Reviews, Favorite Recipes and Featured Links will keep one checking in regularly to see what's new.

Class member Agatha de la Cruz has volunteered to serve as Class Administrator. Agatha would like to invite all Class of 2000 Alumni to stop in and fill out a profile so they can be reached regarding the next Class Reunion. 

This Class-Based Reunion Website is hosted by Classreport.org. For a refreshing change from the large commercial alumni directories, Classreport.org provides non-commercial class reunion websites for every graduating class of every high school, and extends full access to all class members without regard to financial ability. Classreport.org has no advertising, no pop-ups, no spam, and no registrations fees. Classreport.org pledges to never sell names and addresses to third parties and to let the website be administered exclusively by Encinal High School Alumni. Other alumni classes from Encinal High School can be accessed at http://classreport.org/usa/ca/alameda/ehs/."

"event","Wow, I haven't updated in so long!  Like Melisa wrote in her LJ, MySpace and Facebook takes too much of our time already!

Anyway, I still am loving my teaching position.  The kids are great, and I just love the school.  It is at risk of closing (not next school year, but the one after), due to low enrollment, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

Quote of the week:

Me: Today the teachers are going to all eat lunch with Fr. Tony, since it's his birthday.
Student: Is that kind of like the Last Supper, but, instead of Jesus, it's Father Tony?"

"event","The title of this post is a total joke.  The Pilates women, (me and the other girls in my dressing room) made that up yesterday.

Yesterday, we had a 2 p.m. matinee of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and after that, half of the cast went to see ""Ragtime"" at Woodminster.  (If you don't know, they are both musicals with sad endings.)  And, yes, EHS alums, I saw Mr. Moorhead sing and act.  He was great!  I wonder why he doesn't sing more at school.  

It was interesting, too, because the guy who played Jesus in the original ACLO production was in the show.  So, I got to see two Jesuses perform yesterday.

Just a reminder, next week is the final week of ""Jesus Christ Superstar.""  So, don't miss it!  Thanks to all of you who've come to see the show so far!"

Come see ""Jesus Christ Superstar""!!!  It runs from July 8th until July 25th.  Granted, the tickets are super-expensive, so I won't be offended if nobody goes.  Again, there is always the ushering option, but now they require to usher twice for each show of the season.  But, that's not too bad, since ""Guys and Dolls"" and ""Aida"" are sure to be great shows as well!  (Comment me if you're interested in ushering.)

"event","It feels like every other post that I do on Livejournal is an apology for not updating. :-P  Anyway, here's the obligatory post:

* I'm going to finish the school year on Thursday.  However, I will not be staying at the same school.  I could never, repeat never, teach 5th grade again.  It's just not the right age for me, though I do love all my students immensely, no matter how hard they've been on me.  I have been offered a 2nd grade position in Alameda, (though I don't feel comfortable posting exactly where yet publicly online), and I'm seriously considering accepting it.

* Rehearsals for ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" have been going really well.  I think that it's going to be a great show.  (I know that I've said that several times already!)

* The week after school is out, I will be helping with Boy Scout Camp at Crab Cove.  Yes, I will be playing the part of a pirate, and I hope that I will be able to do so convincingly because that is what the Scout leaders keep on saying that we have to do.  :-/

Well, time to finish report cards.  Ugh."

I got cast in ACLO's ""Jesus Christ Superstar.""  So, I'm super-excited about the show.  A lot of the people from ""Man of La Mancha"" were also cast, so it'll be another reunion for us again.  I hope that some of you, (most likely Marie), will come to see the show!"

"event","I had an interesting week:

Sunday: On Saturday, my parents and I watched the classic movie ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" where Al Pacino robs a bank.  On Sunday, we watched ""Walk the Line.""  I discovered an episode of ""Cold Case"" that we had taped, but never had gotten to watching yet.  As I was putting it in, there was an episode of ""Friends"" showing with Reese Witherspoon in it.  (Reese was in ""Walk the Line."")  Then, when I played the ""Cold Case"" episode, it started with robbers disguised in Johnny Cash masks robbing a bank.  (""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""Walk the Line""?)  Strange coincidence, huh?  But it didn't end there.

After watching that and having dinner, I played some ""Cabaret"" songs on the piano.  My friend Allen had decided to sing ""Wilkommen"" for his ACLO audition, and that's why ""Cabaret"" was on my mind.  When I started to watch ""Cold Case,"" the show started playing ""Wilkommen"" and the main character in the story goes to an audition, using the song ""Wilkommen"" as his audition song.  Really weird now, huh?

Monday: It was the last day of my on-campus training that all the 3rd - 5th grade teachers had been taking.  It was good to have a break from teaching, while still being able to see the kids.  But, on this day, the substitute who had taken my job cancelled at the last minute, and two other substitutes were no-shows, so the principal pulled me out of the training to teach my class.  I will have to make up the last day later when the K-2nd grade teachers have the training.

Wednesday: A friend of mine is applying for a job with the Department of State, so I was interviewed by someone from the State Department as a character reference.  I've done a character reference before, but never one that had to be face to face.

Thursday: My friend Allen came over so that we could both practice our audition songs for ACLO.  The audition is one week from today.  Wish me luck!

Friday: Last day of school before Spring Break.  For some reason, this calmed my kids down, and they acted like angels all day.  Why can't they act like that all the time?

Saturday: On Friday, I noticed an ad in the Alameda Journal about a Red Cross Fair that they were holding at Wood School.  I called the youth coordinator to see if they needed any last minute help, and she said that they really needed someone to help pick up the donated pizzas.  So, on Saturday, I went to Round Table, Croll's and Linguini's, picking up 5 pizzas from each place.  Needless to say, my car like a pizzeria by the time I arrived at Wood School."

I've got to reunite with my relatives, and got to do some dirt cheap shopping, too!  (Imagine legal, original VCDs for 2 bucks!  T-shirts for three dollars!)  Also, of course, I've been eating pretty well.  (Yesterday, we ate at a safari-themed Filipino restaurant.  Interesting, huh?)

We did actually pretty well, though we didn't sweep every single category.  (We felt that it would have been unfair if we did. How could Man of La Mancha ever win in choreography over 42nd Street?!?)  We got the top three awards: Best Actress, Best Actor and Best Show.  Yay for Man of La Mancha!!!

Actually, I totally agree with this.  When I took that big trip to Europe a few years ago, London was one of my favorite cities.  I loved the theater.  I loved the sights.  I loved the atmosphere.  People were friendly to the tourists.  I wouldn't mind living in London, but, of course, there's no place that I love more than the Bay Area."

But, alas, today she comes to school talking about how she had found me on MySpace, and she talked about the pictures that I had on it, and how many friends I had on it.  (She was even close to the real number!)

Near the end of the day, when most of the other kids are at band, I discovered that more of my students are on MySpace, and now they've all said that they are going to do a search for me online.  Thank goodness I don't have anything too personal on there!

Well, let's hope that they don't find me on Livejournal next.  (And why are ten year olds on MySpace to begin with!?!)"

"event","Just got home from a weekend long seminar in Sacramento, CA.  Last night, (Saturday), another teacher from my school and I were supposed to have dinner together at the mall and then see a movie together.  What happened was that another person from the seminar asked her if she wanted to go outlet shopping.  She said ""yes"" as long as they got back by 6 p.m., the time that we were supposed to meet.  As I waited for her, she called and said that she was stuck at the outlets and that the person who took her there was in no rush to go home yet, even if she kept on telling her that she had another appointment.  I don't think that she got back to the hotel until after 9 p.m.

With nothing to eat for dinner and nothing better to do, I went to the nearby mall by myself.  Do you know how uncomfortable it is to eat at the Food Court by yourself in a crowded mall?  Oh well, I got through it. :-/"

"event","Broadway's Greatest Moments II was last night.  It was the most attended fundraiser in ACLO history.  If you got to see it, you got to see me dance and sing to ""Hey, Big Spender!""  (That was the mystery song that I was talking about.)  

Why do people like La Pinata over Juanita's?  Who knows, but the cast agreed to all go to La Pinata after the show.  It was so crowded that only half the people were able to get seats, so instead of waiting 45 minutes to an hour to get seated, the rest of us headed off to Juanita's, which was practically empty.  That worked out for me, since we got our food sooner than we would have at La Pinata, and I was able to get home at a decent hour. (12:15 a.m. :-P)

All in all, it was a great show.  I wish that you guys could have been there!"

In other news...

* Got my first pay check on Friday.  Well, not my first pay check ever.  But, my first pay check for a full-time job.  :-)

* Someone is trying to break into my classroom and the classroom next door.  Luckily, the assistant principal noticed that our windows had been tampered with, or I may not have any computers when I come back to school tomorrow.

* I'm starting rehearsals for ACLO's ""Broadway's Greatest Moments II"" show.  It should be a really fun show, with one song that I'm sure many of you would never expect me to be a part of.  But, I'll leave the specifics as a surprise.  (You'll have to see the show to see that! :-P)  Rehearsals start on Tuesday.  Twenty-one out of the 25 members of ""Man of La Mancha"" will be in the show, so it will be like a reunion.

* I'm also busy practicing two rather difficult piano pieces.  My former piano teacher is having a big 80th birthday party, and she asked me and another former student to play during the party.  I hope that I'll be ready in time!

So, life has been pretty busy, but rewarding!"

Today was the first day of school.  I am teaching a 5th grade sheltered class at Melrose Elementary School in Oakland.  It was a great first day, considering that I had only two days to set up my classroom.

This is my favorite quote from the day.  The kids were supposed to be interviewing each other:

Me (on seeing that a pair had stopped working): ""Don't just write down the questions.  You have to interview your partner to answer them.""

Student: I knew that fifth grade was going to be hard."

"event","Remember when Eric said (on the way to Trisha F.'s wedding reception) that I was probably one of the most well-known Filipinos in Alameda (since somebody waved to me outside the hall)...Sometimes I think that that's true.

Case in point:

On Friday, I went to see ACLO's ""42nd Street.""  Actually, I ushered for the show, which means that I helped people find their seats.

It was reunion night for the cast of ""Man of La Mancha,"" and over half of the cast was there.  (They actually cheered ""We want Agatha,"" since they didn't want any other usher to help them find their seats. :-P)  As I was helping them get settled in their seats...

Marie and Crunchy say hello from their seats behind the MOLM cast...

as they say ""hi"", Mia, one of the Von Trapp children from ""The Sound of Music"" calls my name and also says hello.

I also saw a couple that I know from the Red Cross there, as well as my 5th grade teacher and her family!  There were also other people in the audience (and in the show itself) with whom I have been in shows with before.

**************

I guess that some people don't like bumping into people that they know all the time, but I like having that hometown feeling.  Like the Cheers song says, 

""Making your way in the world today 
Takes everything you've got; 
Taking a break from all your worries 
Sure would help a lot. 
Wouldn't you like to get away? 

Sometimes you want to go 
Where everybody knows your name, 
And they're always glad you came; 
You want to be where you can see, 
Our troubles are all the same; 
You want to be where everybody knows your name."""

"event","Well, for the last three weeks, (starting the day after ""La Mancha"" closed), we have been in the process of having our carpet removed, sanding the original hardwood floor, and finally having the floor varnished.  The first week, we moved out all the furniture into the kitchen and the backyard.  The second week was when the contractors did all the work.  During part of this time, we slept over at family friends' homes because we could not sleep in the house.  This past week, we moved back home and moved everything back into the house. :-/ What a process!  But at last it's done.  During that time, I didn't have any internet connection.  Thus, no updates.  But, here at last they are:

On the Friday of closing weekend, Marie came to see the show:

Closing night was on July 24th.  After the show, some of the men in the cast had a shaving party, since they could finally shave their beards off.  But the most shocking change happened with our own Sancho Panza.  He came to the cast party, and we didn't even recognize him!

Well, it's tech week for the show.  It's been pretty hectic, but the run-throughs have been really good.  Tonight, we film the theater trailer (like a movie trailer).  I've never done one of these before, but I've seen them, and they're pretty cool.  I'll post up some pictures of me in costume as soon as I get some.  I look pretty hilarious.  I wear a wig, and have dirt all over my face, (since I'm a prisoner, whose been done in the dungeon for a while).

"event","I've been so busy the past few weeks!  I can't wait until June 16th when school ends.  Well, here's what I've been up to:

May 14th - Graduation Day

We woke up early and were one of the first families at the graduation site.  The master's of education students were the first to get their diplomas, which was good, but we had to sit through all of the other Mills graduates, including all the undergraduates.  The speeches were okay.  I loved the undergraduate one, but the graduate one was just bitter.  It was an English M.F.A. who mainly talked about how her fellow students would never talk to her in class or out of class.  How her speech got picked, I have no idea.

<img src=""http://www.tinypic.com/5jskz4"">
Me with my diploma (well, the folder is actually empty, the diploma hasn't arrived yet)

In the afternoon, we had the teaching credential ceremony.  Luckily, this one was in the concert hall, out of the sun.  The highlight of the ceremony was a speech by one of the secondary teachers which likened our journey as teachers to that of the characters in ""The Wizard of Oz.""  My friends from Cal, Paul and Allen, made it to the ceremony, along with my cousin Andrew and his new girlfriend, Amy.  

<img src=""http://www.tinypic.com/5jsld0"">
Amy, me and Andrew

After the ceremony, Paul, Allen, my parents and I went to the new restaurant Katsu (formerly Sapporro) on Webster Street for dinner, and then Allen, Paul and I went out for karaoke.  (""I Can Be Your Hero"" inside joke :-P)

<img src=""http://tinypic.com/5njh2v"">
My parents, Paul, Allen and me at Katsu

May 16th - First ""Man of La Mancha"" cast rehearsal

I got to meet the cast for the first time.  This will be the smallest musical that I've ever been in with only 26 members of the cast.  I found out that the ensemble only gets to sing a part of the last song, so like ""Cabaret,"" this play won't require a lot of singing from me.  I got to meet Marie and Eric's cousin John.  I can't believe that he is doing all three musicals this season!

May 21st - Graduation Party

The party started at 12 p.m. and didn't end until past 9.  Over 90 people came, ranging from classmates from Encinal and Mills to former castmates to relatives to neighbors to family friends.

<img src=""http://tinypic.com/5njiw5"">
Top row: Ruben, Isabelle, Valene, Joanne
Middle row: Vidia, Tuan
Bottom row: Simon, Jimmy, Kat and me

I'll post a link later on for more pictures of the graduation ceremonies and the party.  I'm still uploading them. (And still writing belated thank you notes as well. :-/)

May 22nd - St. Barnabas Church Festival

I manned the soda and water booth for several hours.  Chatted with Jamie's uncle Steve, who is being ordained as a deacon next week.  

May 24st - And then there were 25...

Second Man of La Mancha rehearsal.  One member of the ensemble dropped out, leaving 25 in the cast.  It was a funny rehearsal because the director gave the entire cast a number, (being first alphabetically, mine is #1), and then proceeded to call us by that number for blocking.  We joked that we would only be known as a number for this play.  (Instead of Jean Valjean's ""Who am I? I'm 24601,"" I was singing ""Who am I?  I'm number 1."")  I do know that I'll be the person who Cervantes snatches his manuscript from, (since I'll be attempting to steal it).  My one claim to stardom. :-P

May 30th - Memorial Day and Cashing in on the giftcards

The morning started with a visit to my Tita Emily's gravesite in Hayward.  Then, we went to Emeryville to shop with giftcards I had gotten for Borders and Banana Republic.  I got ""The Boy from Oz"" cast recording from Borders.  (It was cool to listen to it and realize that I had actually heard these people sing it live in NYC.)  I got a pair of black pants from Banana Republic.  Later, I went online shopping with my three giftcards from Barnes and Noble.  (I didn't buy one book with them either...I got some DVDs and CDs.)

May 31st - Interview

I interviewed for one of two kindergarten positions at Lorenzo Manor, the school where I'm currently student teaching.  Keep your fingers crossed on this one!

June 2nd - Multiage ""Celebration of Learning"" show

The 61 K-2 grade students at the Lorenzo Manor elementary school had their end-of-the-year show.  Needless to say, the past few days were hectic with several rehearsals.  The show went well, though the acoustics weren't too good.  But, as everyone knows, every parent still beamed while they watched, videotaped and photographed their child.

Today - And then there were 24

My third MOLM rehearsal. The cast had to endure a lecture about coming on time and not making last minute excuses for not coming to rehearsal since a lot of us were missing today.  I found out that another member of the cast had dropped out, leaving 24 in the cast.  John got to take over his role.(It's not that they are dropping out because of issues with the show, but because they got bigger roles somewhere else.)  The music director told us that every time he has done the show, the audience left crying, so if you're coming to see the show, be sure to bring some tissues!

Well, that's all for now, folks (if anyone is still left reading this)!"

"event","This morning, I had my master's thesis presentation.  All of the 16 candidates for the master's degree had presentations today, so it was a long day (9-3 p.m.).  My presentation went well, and I think that everyone enjoyed it.  My research topic was the most different of all the other presentations.  Everybody else did studies on themselves as teachers, or on teaching pedagogy.  But, mine was on where public school teachers decide to send their own children to school.  So, it was different.  (I'm sure you're already bored reading this. :-P)

Anyway, I GOT INTO ""MAN OF LA MANCHA""!  I got the call today.  After two seasons of rejection, I finally got back into an ACLO show!  So, I'm really happy.  I'll be, once again, cast in the ensemble.  It will be so fun to be in a show again!

And so ends a great day!"

"event","From my thesis advisor:

""Dear Agatha,  I've finished reading your paper.  It is very complete.""

**********

""Very complete""?  I just can't believe it, considering that it was one of the shortest, if not the shortest, of all the theses turned in.  It's only 24 pages (without appendices and bibliography), which is 10 pages shorter than both my theses in college.  But, I guess that it was ""complete"" enough to work.  I'm still shocked, though.

By the way, about five minutes after I wrote the entry talking about how I couldn't put on my graduation hood, I figured it out. :-P"

With a birthday on the 14th of the month (5 energy) you are inclined to work well with people and enjoy them. 

You are talented and versatile, very good at presenting ideas, and you are also very good at organization and systematizing. 

You may have a tendency to get itchy feet at times and need change and travel. 



You tend to be very progressive, imaginative and adaptable. 

Your mind is quick, clever and analytical. 

A restlessness in your nature may make you a bit impatient and easily bored with routine, and rebel against it. 

You have a tendency to shirk responsibility.</td>

"event","So, this week, my computer posts a warning saying that it is near full memory in the C drive.  (Well, it's over 5 years old, so that's expected.)

Anyway, I was cleaning out files, seeing what I should throw away, and I found this picture:
<img src=""http://tinypic.com/4r6hjl"">

When I was in ACLO's ""The King and I"", the guy who played the King, Andrew Hasegawa, came all the way from Canada to play the part (for free!)  He had us sign a poster for Mrs. Anna, but I think that a lot of us didn't really understand why.  Then, he sends us the above picture.  (Anna died in Canada.)  I wonder what the cemetary cleaning people thought when they saw all the stuff from a production hailing from Alameda, California.  Andrew said that he left all the things there at her grave."

"event","My long day:

8:00 a.m. - Went to the San Lorenzo Unified District office to complete my substitute application.  (When my cooperating teacher can't be at school, she wants me to sub for her.)

8:20 a.m. - Arrive at Lorenzo Manor for student teaching.

11:00 a.m. - Teach a math lesson, get observed by my supervisor.  Lesson does not go as well as hoped.

12:00 p.m. - Lunch, where my supervisor and cooperating teacher discuss my lesson.

3:00 p.m. - Leave Lorenzo Manor, drive to Mills

3:30 p.m. - Arrive at Mills.  Proof thesis one more time.

4:15 p.m. - Attempt to print thesis.  Somehow the format gets messed up.

5:00 p.m. - After cutting and repasting my thesis on a new Word document, having to reformat EVERYTHING, I finally turn my thesis in.

5:20 p.m. - Arrive 20 min. late to tutor my 5th grade student

6:35 p.m. - Arrive home.  Eat dinner.

7:25 p.m. - Quickly print out my homemade headshot.

7:45 p.m. - Make it just in time for my ACLO ""Man of La Mancha"" audition.

8:00 p.m. - Sing my song horribly, yet the music director calls me back later to do some scales for him.

8:50 p.m. - After some waiting, I don't receive a callback.  (Nothing unusual.  I usually don't.)

9:05 p.m. - Arrive home.

Now: It's finally the end of a long, long day!

Quote of the day: Fellow auditioner: ""Some of the girls here dress so provocatively...don't they know that the directors are all gay?"""

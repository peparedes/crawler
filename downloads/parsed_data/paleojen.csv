"event","""However, there is considerable confusion about the process, and the state party admits to being ""overwhelmed"" by calls from Democratic voters seeking guidance. Washington, in an arrangement that even local political leaders find bizarre, has both a caucus on Feb. 9 and a primary on Feb. 19, meaning that voters are currently staring at mail-in primary ballots at the same time as they're trying to figure out their caucus locations. Even more confusing, Democrats use only the caucuses to apportion delegates, making the primary effectively meaningless for them, while Republicans use the caucuses to apportion 19 of their 40 delegates and their primary to apportion the rest. (The situation has an acrimonious, and convoluted history that involves a controversial victory by televangelist Pat Robertson in the state's 1988 Republican caucuses, which prompted an intervention by the state legislature that resulted in the still unresolved caucus-and-primary problem.)""&nbsp; from <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1711355,00.html"">The Confusing Battle for Washington State</a><br /><br />So, that bit about staring at ballots while trying to figure out my caucus location? That exactly described my situation this afternoon, sitting on my bed with ballots around me while I tried to figure out what precinct I'm in and where it meets.&nbsp; As it turns out, it's on the other side of Pullman, on a street forebodingly named Crestview."

"event","&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In December, a pair of economists published a paper in which they looked for a correlation between violent movies and violent crime. They found one, but it wasn't the one they expected. According to the <a href=""http://www.dklevine.com/archive/refs4122247000000001778.pdf"">paper</a>, the connection was inverse. Blockbuster violent movies such as Hannibal led to a decrease in violent crime, and as many as 1,000 violent crimes per week may be prevented by violent movies. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing I really found interesting about this study is their proposed mechanisms - self incapacitation and segregation from alcohol. <br />It turns out that the main demographic for violent movies is young men - the same segment of the population that's most likely to commit violent crime. Therefore, if these people are in a theater chair, they're not on the street. Also, alcohol is generally prohibited in theaters in America, so there's a double whammy. On weekends when there's a big violent film out, those most likely to commit violent crimes are not drinking and off the street for apparently critical hours, because there is no compensating rise in crime after the weekend.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; We've had strong, well-made psychology studies for a while now that subjected college students to short clips of either violent or non violent movies, then monitored their behavior immediately afterwards in group settings. These studies almost invariably found that people who watched the violent clip exhibited more violent behavior than those exposed to the nonviolent clip. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, now there's an impasse as to the possible damage done by violent media. The psychologists say that people are more aggressive after being exposed to violent, but the economists say that not only is there a decrease in violence after watching violent movies, but that that violence isn't made up for by more violence later. That possible violence just disappears. This might be a classic case of <i>in vitro </i>results not being the same as <i>in vivo&nbsp; </i>results, but it's hard to tell. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, maybe there's not an impasse. One of the psychologists' implicit assumptions is that aggression inevitably leads to violence, an assumption that I think is demonstrably false. However, if we assume&nbsp; instead that aggression <i>often leads to </i>violence, and that perhaps the effects of violent media are cumulative and take more than a few weeks to show up, then there isn't necessarily a conflict at all."

"event","So, I found out a couple of days ago that I have filled all the requirements for a B.S. in General Sciences specializing in Geology, Biology, and Chemistry. All I would have to do is change my major, drop my minor, and apply for graduation, and be done. No more classes, I'd just find a job for 3 months, volunteer heavily at the Palouse Science Center and the Conner museum and walk in May as planned. I would save a couple thousand dollars, and possibly start paying off my loans while not being stressed out all the time. 

Or I could struggle on through Biochem, Cell biology, and yet another Writing In the Major course, incur a couple thousands of dollars worth of debt, and graduate in May with the B.S. in Biology and a minor in Geology. 

The pros of the Biology degree are that it's a slightly stronger degree and would give me a bit of an edge in applying for jobs in the Biology field. The cons of the Biology degree are that it would cost more, stress me out more, and is not entirely friendly to the education field. 

The pros of the General Sciences degree are that it's cheaper, has much less stress associated with it, and it has a broader scope than the biology degree. A few of the random science classes that I took at SPSCC count for it, but don't count for the biology degree. Also, it's friendlier to the education field, which doesn't care so much that I can analyze the ecosystem of a given swamp but that I can understand and explain how science works and what people do in various disiciplines. 

The cons of the General Sciences degree are that it's not as focused as the biology degree, and lots of people can't make up their minds what they want to do so they get a General Fill-In-The-Blank degree, and as such has a bit of a bad rep. For a job in the biologic field, a general sciences degree is less competitive than a straight-up biology degree. 

I've emailed a few people about this, but so far only one of them has gotten back to me. The Director of the Conner Museum (by trade and Ph.D a biologist) opined that the general sciences degree would probably be a better choice for me, and that if I needed to get back into the biologic field then it wouldn't really hold me back too much, considering my work experience and references. 

I just don't know - The idea of not having to wade through another semester is extremely attractive, but I don't want to shoot myself in the foot by choosing a degree that limits me. I have until the 7th to decide, because that's when classes start, so hopefully an answer will appear. If anybody has advice, I'm all ears."

Kayla's dress is white chiffon with blue and white beading with a gathering detail at the waist, and her colors are dark blue, light green and grey. <br />We're looking at dresses that a)have decent straps, because dancing in strapless dresses is sort of stupid and I have a personal vendetta against spaghetti straps, b) is made out of chiffon, because it'd be silly to have more formal dresses than the bride, and c) look good.

We may decide to go with different dresses, but I'd like to at least get them from the same manufacturer so that we'll be in the same shade. <br />Colorwise, we've been thinking that having the dress be dark blue with an accent of grey or green is best, both for availability and rewearability reasons.

Access to a ridiculously tall building with heavy doors is access to a ridiculously tall building with heavy doors. The ground floor has been abandoned to the zombies, but the stairwells and all levels above are all ours. We keep most of the important equipment on the 11th and 12th floors just in case, though. <br />The rooftop is a very very nice place to have. You can see pretty much all of what's left of Pullman from there. There are distinct waves of devastation in rings outwards from the cemeteries, and I am now fervently glad that I didn't live on Sunnyside Hill. The largest cemeteries create the largest hordes, and Sunnyside had a lot of denizens. Certainly it had more denizens than we have survivors now. Last I counted, we had a core of 10 determined people and probably 15 more that just might commit suicide in the next couple of weeks. I know there's more people out there - I think there's some people holed up on the watertower, and the occasional crack of gunshot ricochets out of Greek Row. <br />We're trying to fortify ourselves here at the university. The hill's packed full of tunnels if we can figure out where they are and how to use them, and with Webster as the watchtower we can see them before they can see us. However, we can only hold out here as long as our food holds out. The next order of business is gaining territory and food. <br />Jeremiah worked for Facilities before, and he's working on drawing up rough maps of the now-empty steam tunnels and such. I'm heading a scouting party to Abelson at dawn - we have enough food for a couple of months if we're tight-belted, but as soon as winter hits we could be in rough shape, and the highly defendable greenhouses are our best bet for survival. With any luck, Jakob and Laura are at the Cereal greenhouse last night. I'd be very very surprised if zombies had broken in to that particular stronghold, and I'm hoping that a few stalwarts may be holding out in there. More people who we don't have to baby are always welcome. <br />Morning comes too soon, so I sign off now. Good luck, survivors. <br /><br /><br />PS:&nbsp; <a href=""http://myelvesaredifferent.blogspot.com/2007/05/blog-like-its-end-of-world-bliteotw.html"">This is what's going on.</a><br />~Jen"

We were more than a few miles out of town, but the pigeon didn't seem to care. Pigeons are normally city birds - they need cave-like structures in which to nest, which is why they like eaves so much. They're most decidedly not farm birds or savannah birds. I really have no idea why the bird was out there, but it seemed to be content. *shrugs*

In other news, Jerry Falwell's dead. Falwell's one of those people who I reserve the right to be offended at, but recognize that offending people is probably their goal. Looking back at all the inflammatory statements that he made and then slightly modified after the ruckus broke out, he really did seem to have specialized in getting people's goat. 

I did learn a couple of things about him, though. For instance, he started a university. Liberty University in Virginia, to be exact. The university, although having somewhat peculiar student conduct codes is accredited, and the associated law school has conditional (?) accredation from the American Bar Association. I will admit to being somewhat skeptical of any religiously based school, but Liberty is definitely better than some of the religious schools that tried to attract me way back when. Most of them were nonaccredited.

The live which I led there with my cousins was full of charm, and so is the memory of it yet. I can call back the solemn twilight and mystery of the deep woods, the earthy smells, the faint odors of the wild flowers, the sheen of rain-washed foliage, the rattling clatter of drops when the wind shook the trees, the far-off hammering of woodpeckers and the muffled drumming of wood-pheasants in the remoteness of the forest, the shap-shot glimpses of disturbed wild creatures skurrying through the grass, - I can call it all back and make it as real as it ever was, and as blessed. I can call back the prarie, and its lonelienss and peace, and a vast hawk hanging motionless in the sky, with his wings spread wide and the blue of the vault showing through the fringe of their end-feathers. ""<br /> ""I can see the woods in thiir autumn dress, the oaks purple, the hickories washed with gold, the maples and the sumacs luminous with crimsion fires, and I can hear the rustle made by the fallen leaves as we ploughed through them. I can see the blue clusters of wild grapes hanging amongst the foilage of teh saplings, and I remember the tast of them and the smell. I know how the wild blackberries looked, and how they tasted; and the same with the pawpaws, the hazelnuts and the persimmons; and I can feel the thuymping rain, upon my head, of hickory-nuts and walnuts when we were out in the frosty dawn to scramble for them with the pigs, and the gusts of wind loosed them and sent them down. I know the stain of blackberries, and how pretty it is; and I know the stain of walnut hulls, and how little it minds soap and water; also what grudged experience it had of either of them. I know the tast of maple sap, and when to gather it, and how to arrange the troughs and the delivery tubes, and how to boil down the juice.""<br /> ""I know how a prize watermelon looks when it is sunning its fat rotundity amoung pumpkin vines and ""simblins""; I know how inviting it looks when it is cooling itself in a tub of water under the bed, waiting; I know how inviting it looks when it lies on the table in the sheltered great floor-space between house and kitchen, and the children gathered for the sacrifice and their mouths watering; I know the crackling sound it makes when the carving-knife enters its end, and I can see the split flly along in front of the blade as the knife cleaves its way to the other end; I can see its halves fall apart and display the rich red meat and black seeds, and the hear standing up, a luxury fit for the elect; I know how a boy looks, behind a yard-long slice of that melon, and I know how he feels; for I have been there.""<br /> ""I know the look of green apples and peaches and pears on the trees, and I know how entertaining they are when they are inside of a person. I know how ripe ones look when they are piled in pyramids under the trees, and how pretty they are and how vivid their colors. I know how a frozen apple looks, in a barrel down cellar in the winter-time, and how hard it is to bite, and how the frost makes the teeth ache, and yet how good it is, notwithstanding.I know the disposition of elderly people to select the specked apples for the children, and I once knew ways to beat the game. I know the look of an apple that is roasting and sizzling on a hearth on a winter's evening, and I know the comfort that comes of eating it hot, along with some sugar and a drench of cream. I know the delicate art and mystery of so cracking hickory-nuts and walnuts on a flatiron with a hammer so that the kernels will be delivered whole, and I know how the nuts, taken in conjunction with winter apples, cider and doughnuts, make old people's tales and old jokes sound fresh and crisp and enchanting, and juggle an evening away before you know what went with the time.""<br /><br />Over hundred years have passed since Twain wrote this, but I can identify with all that he writes here, and that is his great gift, I think. He reaches back to childhood and presents with unique clarity what he remembers there, always with the disclaimer that his memory is not what it once was. But our memory is not what it once was either, and it seems that his memory is more vivid than ours; his discriptions blow the dust off our recollections of childhood and we feel happy to have recaptured those errant memories.<br /></div>"

"event","Ready for a mindbender?<br />It turns out that giraffes don't have long necks for foraging reasons. <br />Apparently they don't really care about reaching the tops of the tall acacia trees. A few intrepid researchers spent two years recording giraffe foraging behavior, and they spent the vast majority of their time grabbing leaves from about (giraffe) shoulder-height. Not even during drought periods did the giraffes get a large amount of food from the tops of the trees. So, no foraging benefit from the long necks at all. <br />However, in watching the giraffes for such long periods of time, the researchers noticed something else. Male giraffes really care about beating each other up with long and/or heavy necks. It's their main method of competition. Also, female giraffes like the long, sturdy necks, and and a heavy skull is sexy too.<br />Conclusion: Sexual selection can do really odd things. I'm kinda boggled about this; I've heard pretty much my entire life that the giraffe necks were the product of forage selection. I've been lied to for so long....:p<br /><br /><a href=""http://bill.srnr.arizona.edu/classes/182/Giraffe/WinningByANeck.pdf"">Winning By a Neck, R. E. Simmons and L. Scheepers</a>"

I bought a pair of sunglasses, among other things. The pair that I got during Spring Break fell apart in an amazingly thorough fashion the first day of school, so I've been hankering for a new pair. 
The wedding was awesome. Much stress on Jon and the Mother of the Bride's part, but I really think that things went well. The bride was very serene, and there was music, dancing, and very very good cake at the reception. 
&nbsp;It was a Hindu-Christian ceremony, which is a new one for me. They had a bit in the vows about seeing each other as complete persons in their own right, which I liked. The rest of it I only vaguely remember now, but there was a lot about 'cosmic harmony' and such scattered through the entire ceremony. 
The other interesting thing about the wedding was the prevalence of fairy wings. All the bridesmaids wore wings, as did the bride. I'm beginning to wonder if there's a trend starting, or if I'm just hitting all the unique weddings. 
On Saturday, Jonsonite and I went to go see Brian's new apartment, which is throughly spiffy, and pick up a used car, which is also spiffy but in a 'old volvo whose exhast pipe hits the bumper when it stalls' kind of way. We got caught in Bumbershoot traffic that night and stalled on a hill, but Jon was able to get the car going again in short order. 
Sunday was my lazy day, and involved waaaay too much hamburger, a good movie, and lots of napping. I need to have more of that type of day. 
Today I caught a ride back to Pullman with Amanda, got my ochem lab done, and started work on cleaning up the disaster area that is my room.

Star Trek and Star Wars have wars involving genetic manipulation, and touch on the fear of techology's intimacy with the human body.&nbsp; Babylon 5 has more wars over various things than you can shake a stick at.&nbsp; Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea expresses vividly the fear of techology being sequestered in the distant hands of aristocrats. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stories set in the current time period don't deal as firmly or clearly with these fears. People don't buy books that depict war in Iraq or terror in Darfur. It seems that the mere act of putting the fear and the danger in the future mitigates it, muffles it enough that people can think about it in a reasonable fashion.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it follow, then, that the science fiction being written right now, that sells at this very moment, might depict most clearly our fears and troubles? If one conducted a survey of these stories, could one glimpse the hidden mind of the people?"

Johnson has windowed offices wrapped around a core of lab spaces, with elevators and stairways stuck on the outside. The guiding idea was that people would work harder if they didn't have outside views to distract them. Anyone who's worked in a windowless room knows how surreal it can be to walk out of your workspace and be confronted with weather. 
The Plant Bioscience building, on the other hand, is a narrow wedge. Laboratories occupy the entire space, and every room has windows in it. Apparently the university decided that slightly distracted scientists are better than depressed and/or disoriented scientists.

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I'm still sick, but I did finish <u>The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich</u> just now. It's a very long book, but it didn't seem so long when I was reading it. It's written from the German's point of view before and during WW2, using documents seized after the war and personal accounts of people who lived there. I found this to be very interesting, becuase all of the history of that era I've learned has been from America's point of view. Most of it went along the lines of ""Hitler was bad, invaded countries, and killed lots of Jews and other people. Oh, and he was insane."" &nbsp;&nbsp; While that is true, it doesn't say that quite a few countries didn't resist being taken over, and that for a very long time England did nothing to defend its allies and even was politically maneuvering to have them taken over as quickly and painlessly as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't mean to say that <u>Rise and Fall </u>presents a complete picture of the global politics, though. I would like to know a bit more about the Allies' agreements as to who got which parts of Germany, ect. My maternal grandfather was a medic in the Canadian army - he started in Egypt and ended up in Germany. He used to relate a story about how his company couldn't enter one concentration/death camp until Russian forces got there. They had to wait for several days while the prisoners inside died. He could never forgive the Russians for making them wait outside that camp. The only reason that I can think of that a company of medics would have to wait for a different army to come would be because Russia was claiming that territory and wasn't allowing English or American forces to help with the liberation. That's just speculation, though. <br /><br />Overall, I think it's a really good book, though it does take a sizable chunk of time to read (1500 pages). It gives very clear examples of what happens when people give in to unreasonable demands. Because really, that's all the Hitler did. He made unreasonable demands of other countries, and they folded. He made unreasonable demands of his armies, and they died for him. <br /><br /><br />"

"event","Today has been occupied soley with dealing with yet another sore throat. Student Death says it isn't strep, so that's good. On the other hand, that means that there's no magic pills that'll make it all better. 
My boss gave me today and maybe tomorrow off, because nobody over there wants to get sick. That leaves me lots of time to sleep and read in my nice warm, nest-like bed."

"event","Today was the last day of my first week of working full-time. The job's going really well, I think. I'm getting a handle on my duties, and a routine is developing. I'm the chief dishwasher and pipette-tip-box filler. Nothing really intellectually stimulating, but I do get to play whatever music I want while I work. I'm also learning a lot about wheat genetics, as I'm working in the Cereal Disease Laboratory.
Kayla and I finished moving things into 208 yesterday afternoon, so our living room is filled with assorted boxes and piles of things. The kitchen is less of a disaster area, but definitely not finished. I really need to find a bookcase; most of the things still on the floor are books. There's also all sorts of other things and a huge Goodwill pile, though. 
I didn't get out to the garden until tonight, and was quite pleased to see the peas poking through the soil and the newly-lush strawberries and chives. The raspberries are getting ready to flower, so I'm giving up on moving any more plants and am working on tying them up/together. I also drenched the plot throughly - I feel that a large amount of the weak flavor of last summer's berries was due to drought. Tomorrow I'm going to put out the tomato and zucchini plants, along with the green beans. Mmm, green beans. And tomatoes. I'm really looking forward to fresh produce."

When it does we will be in trouble.  But for now we survived.  The cutest was getting a phone call from my neice first checking if I still lived in Florida and then after finding out I am still in Florida, telling me that I am supposed to be in Michigan this weekend."

<TD>You're a helluva guy, a real split personality and a bit of an enigma. On the one hand, you're a man's man, tough talking and ready for anything. But on the other hand, you soften your rough and tumble core with a disarmingly smooth exterior, and you make the ladies swoon. You're equally admired by both men and women alike, drinking other men under the table all the while charming the socks off half a dozen lovelies. You're a commanding presence, and you know how to get what - and who - you want when you want it. You're drawn to women who, like you, are savvy enough to deal with the world on their own terms. You work well with spitfires. Leading ladies include Joan Crawford, Myrna Loy, and Jean Harlow. No damsels in distress for you.

"event","Well I am still moving in Sept but I am now looking for a house to rent.  I have a friend that is a realtor that is working on a few things.  She knows someone who buys houses to rent to people with bad credit.  She is hooking me up with a guy that does this.  She has talked to him about me and he is looking for things with me in mind.  I am so happy.  If it works out I would be a home owner is 2 years.  

I started my job at Nextel.  I love it.  The people I work with tend to act like children from time to time but other then that I like it.  Tomorrow is my last day here at Protocol.  My boss Mike is predicting that I will be back by October 17th of this year.  I think I won't ever work here again but hey I am not burning any bridges because this place is always hiring so if I don't work out at Nextel I will need something.  I am hoping to last at Nextel.  What's nice is that she is looking for an assistant for the store so I am making that my goal.  I think it would come down to me and 2 other people so the odds are there.  I know one girl for sure won't get it because she cannot take pressure.

I am so happy that I am finally on a road that will lead me to great things.  Sat down and talked with some friends and learned things from their point of few and so it helped me make some needed changes.  It's good when you have friends that are true enough to speak their mind to you.  It brings back memories of friends that were in my life and different stages.  I finally have friends locally that will be honest with me.  It has taken a while and really I have only had a handful of friends that were honest to me when it came to me.  For those that may still see this I thank you for showing me what a true friendship looks like."

Tomorrow is my first day and I am really just looking forward to it.  With this job I have the chance to go back to school because they have tuition reimbersment.  I cannot wait :):):)  So there are many changes coming.

Getting ready to move in August/Sept.  Getting a 2 bedroom.  I am happy about that.  Moving closer to some of my friends so I cannot wait.  other then that nothing new."

"event","Wow, it's been a while since I have done a real entry.  Not to much is new.  Got a promotion at work.  Nothing too exciting but hell I don't have to be on the phone all day anymore so that's a plus.  But I do have to deal with those that want to yell.  Oh the Joy's of being a team lead.  Thinking about starting counseling again.  It's about time I think.  A lot of people agree with me too it seems.  I am lucky to have a few friends that I can talk with and get an honest opinion from.  Not that I don't know I have more but right now I need a different point of view.  

I did a change that I have been wanting to do for a while.  I shaved my head.  It looks good and I love it so I will prolly keep it this short for a while.  Sorry to those who liked my hair but it's all gone for now :)

This will be my last public entry.  If you want access to it then comment here and I will make sure you have access."

"event","What a past couple of days.  Just when you think you know what friendship is you learn you don't.  Had a great friendship forming and for the first time in forever I didn't cause it to end.  It's also the first time me being gay has bothered a friend's boyfriend.  I don't get it and I don't think I ever will.  You learn through life that boyfriends come and go but friends are forever and I am learning that line is a crock of shit.  Whoever came up with that needs to be shot.  Chances are they are already dead but if not then they need to be shot.  I am at the point where I am tired of trying to make friends.  I make a connection with one and her boyfriend does everything he can to distroy it and me.  I don't know if the distroying me was supposed to be part of it but he achieved it and it hurts.  I have never had anyone make me feel like a cheap whore.  This maybe slightly over the top but I mean come on I didn't do anything to deserve this but befriend his girlfriend.  I mean come on.  Is she not allowed to have friends outside of you?  Does her world have to revolve totally around you without thoughts of other friends?  I don't find this fair at all.  But she keeps asking me to give her time to talk to him and I am trying but it's not easy.  It's a friendship that is worth it....I know this.  I just don't know if I have the patience to do it.  I have been burned so much."

Remember ~ Josh Groban 

Remember, I will still be here
As long as you hold me, in your memory

Remember, when your dreams have ended
Time can be transcended 
Just remember me

I am the one star that keeps burning, so brightly,
It is the last light, to fade into the rising sun

I'm with you
Whenever you tell, my story
For I am all I've done

Remember, I will still be here
As long as you hold me, in your memory
Remember me

I am the one voice in the cold wind, that whispers
And if you listen, you'll hear me call across the sky

As long as I still can reach out, and touch you
Then I will never die

Remember, I'll never leave you
If you will only
Remember me

Remember me...

Remember, I will still be here
As long as you hold me
In your memory

Remember, when your dreams have ended
Time can be transcended
I live forever 
Remember me

Remember me
Remember... me...

Rest in peace, my friend....you will never be forgotten...."

"event","<font face=""Kristen ITC"" font color=""#800080""> I wrote one of my favorite authors an email the other day and got a repsonse from her.  I asked her if she could send me the poem that  she wrote for her daughter Nichole who passed away.  It was a poem that I saw again right around the passing of my sister and it helped me so I asked her if she could resend it to me.  I wanted to post it hear to share with everyone. At the bottom of the poem is the website of the author.

<font color=""#008080""><b>WELCOME HOME
 
Angels met her in The Garden as a sign of 'Welcome Home.' 
They spoke graciously of love without resistance,
Then sang sweetly in the gloaming that she never more need roam.
She was reassured of her divine existence.
 
She felt peace she had forgotten, and no longer did she yearn
For she found herself where she was meant to be.
Looking down she saw the sadness; ""It was time that I return.
They'd be joyous if my face they could now see.""
 
Older angels gently whispered, ""Now a guardian you are.""
She smiled brightly as she thought of each tomorrow.
She'd watch over all her loved ones from this paradise afar,
Making sure they would not suffer needless sorrow.
 
Every action has a purpose, though to us it is unclear
Why this angel joined the celestial midst.
Try to put aside your heartache, disappointment, and your fear,
By the ancients of the ages she's been kissed.

"event","Life is an unless rollar coaster.  I am still dealing with the loss of my sister and start crying at the silliest things.  My stress level is unmanagable.  I am the only one really working.  It's no fault of Christina's.  She is in market research and her bosses aren't scheduling her.  It sucks.  I am still working 2 jobs.  It is getting to much.  I have no time for me.  Yes I am playing ball but that isn't really enough because all I do is come home exhausted.  I feel like I am close to breaking but yet I can't stop because right now ball is my only out.

Talked with my mommy today.  Turns out that she has a boyfriend.  I know nothing about this man but he passed my Aunt Jan's test so he must be okay.  My aunt is offically my mother's guardian.  They are now in the process of getting my aunt something else too.  I have no idea what it is but my mom is happy so that's all that matters."

I know she is gone and not forgotten but I refuse to accept the reality that I will never talk with her again.  This wasn't the way I planned life.  My sister and I were suppsoed to bury my mother together and the grow old watching her kids grow up, graduate, and get married.  But now it's just me watching them grow up.  So many choices to make.  Do I move back to Michigan to help with the kids or do I stay in Florida.  B made a good point that both she and I are away and it gives the kids somewhere to go in the summer's when they get older.  So I am thinking that I will stay in Florida.  I haven't really accepted it so those that know me will prolly worry for a while.  I don't know how to let go.  I never thought that I would go through life without a sister.  Well I am going to wrap this up because I have been staring at this screen all afternoon."

Seems like life never slows down.  My sister and brother in law will be coming down in June(I hope) and I will get to spend 2 days with them before they head on their cruise.  Well one with the whole family and one day with just my niece and nephew.  It should be fun.  Hannah always brings the little kid back in me.

Been thinking a lot about my family and what to do.  I feel so useless when it comes to my sister because she is in Michigan and I am here but I feel like she would be disappointed if I moved back to Michigan just because she was sick.  She knows my life(what there is of it) is down here but yet I feel so helpless because I can't help her in anyway.  It was great because they were planning this vacation but then it got moved up and Brian took over the planning so everything has gotten changed so it's like that little planning is gone too.  I want to help I just don't know how to anymore.

Friends are hard to come by now a days.  I am learning that complete strangers are more willing to help you out when you need it then my friends are.  But then again this maybe why I don't have many real friends.  Does that make life boring????? a little but less hurt.  I wish people could just be real and true to themselves.  Makes life easier for everyone.

I hate working 2 jobs.  Seems like that isn't even enough but in all honesty I have no choice.  With C not working again right now it's the only income coming in.  People think the solution is find a job that makes more money but the issue is the job market.  There really isn't anything out there right now.  I would love a ""normal"" job but it's not there and with me working so much when do I have the time to interview?  I am it's not like I can quit one job just to free up my days on an off chance that I will get an interview.  That just isn't realistic."

"event","Well it's been forever since I have written in my journal so I figured I would write.....See E I am not just staring at the screen.  Not sure what I will write but I figured I would just write and let the fingers go.  It's been forever since I have done a real post but it's hard with no access.  Life has been a teacher os patience.  I know that seems like a duh thought but I never learn anything the easy way. 
Friends have come and gone in my life and most of those I haven't batted an eye at but there are a few that really touched my life.  Lately, I have been learning the value of a true friendship.  Those that I thought were true aren't and it bothers me.  I mean it's no wonder Christians get a bad rep.  The girl acts like my friend but then it's I need to go my bibical duty as a friend and tell you that being gay is wrong.  Now, don't get me wrong being gay was something that I have struggled with for a while.  I spent many hours in prayer just praying that God would make me straight and that I wasn't really gay but through those hours of prayer I got a peace over me that it is okay to be gay and that was the way that God made me.  It's people own problem if they don't believe you.  It's your job to do what God has planned in your life.  It's what I am finally doing.  I am finally happy with who I am.  If you don't believe that I have made the peace then it's your problem not mine.  I am just sorry that I lost a friendship over all this but this is how is has to be.  I may not have that many friends left but those that I have I cherish.

It's weird that some friendships fail and that others florish.  It's a strange feeling.  Not really used to it.  It's taught me that people are placed in my life for a reason.  There are a lot that have a special place in my heart and I miss greatly but if it's meant to be then the friendships come back.  If they aren't then I take what I have learned and florish from that and the lessons I was taught when they in my life."

I cannot take this anymore
I'm saying everything I've said before

Less I hear the less you'll say
But you'll find that out anyway

Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

My life is like this lately and I hate it.  I have given up on everyting that I believe in.  I am learning that friendships are highly overrated and that giving a dhit about people just gets your burned?  I am at the point where I am not even going to bother anymore.  I am going to become a cold heartless bitch.  Not like it matters because I cannot keep friendships anyway.  I have learned that one through experience."

"event","How do I deal with the unknown?  Though it's not really the unknown.  It's more like some sick waiting game.  Why does it have to be my sister who's cancer can't be beaten.  Why is it that we will be lucky to habe her around long enough to see Colin graduate from Pre-school.  Yes, that's only 3 years away but the doctor's aren't sounding to optimistically on that.  Why don't I have the ability to look into the furture and know how much of my neice's life she will see.  I always hoped that she would beat the cancer but right now the cancer is beating us.  Why does it have to be this way.  Where is the miracle?  We need one now.  She is too young to have to worry about this.  She should be able to watch all 3 of her kids grow up."

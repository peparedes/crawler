"event","Yes is true I AM GROUND FOR  GRADES! I made a D in math -_- But it wasnt my fault, it was the teacher becuase I went on feild trip and he marked out nd said that I skipped class so  he gave me a ""O"". so I have to work very hard and try to earn an A+ or a B+ in Math.  I have one question.... Why is it that when I make a cool guild I always get ground or something ? Tell me why! -___-"

Got me sick, Yesterda was our clss feild trip
to out state. We left around 6:00a.m. and came back
at 11:14p.m. When I was on my feild trip I sat by my friends while
playing the Gameboy Advance, as I was play we kept bouncing up and down on the bus cuz of the street bumps. Its was very fun indeed but I think I got sick on that part, hen we got to Memphis, TN I stared to look around for some cute boys but I didnt found any. ;.;
Later on we was heading back to our city, where I sleep most of the time."

How because in Math ( Which I hate ) I probably didn't do so good and my mother would not be so happy at all. So all I can do know it prey to o might god that he should let me pass with a grade that my mother wouldnt be mad at me or something. Please people, PREY FOR ME !"

With your sensuous charm
You looked so alarmed
As I walked on by
And oh some wonder
You had to know why I did not respond
To carry on...

Love me in a special way
What more can I say?
Love me now
Love me in a special way
What more can I say?
Love me now."

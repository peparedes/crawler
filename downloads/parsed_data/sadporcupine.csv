"event","Today was  my dad's birthday, so we stayed up till 4 in the morning (monday morning, that is) watching some old horror movie. ""The Devil Bat"" or something. It was humorous, since the bat flew around all funny.

And so I was tired from the second I woke up (11.I had 7 hours of sleep) 

Right when my dad went to work, I crashed on the couch to read a book about jimi hendrix. once I was done with the intro I fell asleep  (although, it's a good book :D).

and I woke up now. and it's all nasty outside. all groggy and stuff. so i made popcorn and got a Jones. but I didn't like the popcorn, so my brother ate it.

And I put on some Beck (odelay <3). And then it started raining. And pouring. And I realized that if it rained all day, I would listen to Odelay over and over and over."

I was gonna have a banana today. When I grabbed it, I realized it was rotten, and all of the 'nanna oozed out."

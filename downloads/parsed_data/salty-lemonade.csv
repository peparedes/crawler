What once was thought to be the end, is now only what could be the beginning of something.  Anything at all.  Something I can hold on to.

What once was wonderful, once was terrible, now is free, and I refuse to put any more worry into it.  Let it be what it is, and I will embrace it wholeheartedly.

What once could have ruined me, now WILL ruin me, and nothing could bring me to a greater level of content and profound understanding of the way the world works.

What once tortured me, still makes me ache, but I have slowly begun the healing process.

What once made you all lose a bit more respect for me, will make you hate and despise me.  And if you choose to hate me, I hope to god you rot in hell, because none of this is anything you can change.  It is the inevitable."

And even then I felt horrible because everytime our lips met my mind sent a jolt throughout my whole body that said, ""Steph's here.  She's alone.  Steph's alone and feeling just the way you used to all the time.  You aren't even dating him.""

Even then it was terribly hard to pull myself away and say, ""Steph, are you okay? I love you, Stephie,   are you sure you're fine?  You positive?  ... Okay... You sure?  ...""

"event","<P><FONT size=2>I remember when I used to pray every night.&nbsp; I used to sit up and hold my tiny golden cross necklace between my hands and I would look at the ceiling and in my head I would say, ""Dear God.&nbsp; Or Jesus... Lord...?&nbsp; Would you show me that you're there?""&nbsp; And I would give him something to demonstrate his existance.&nbsp; I would think, ""Lord, make my mommy cough,"" or, ""Lord?&nbsp; Would you make me not have a nightmare tonight?""&nbsp; And then I would, almost every night, almost fall asleep.&nbsp;I would jerk myself out of it at the last moment, though.&nbsp; And I would stare up at the black ceiling, the tv playing in the living room, my mind buzzing, and I would put all of my energy into my hands, and I would squeeze my cross and think, ""Lord, bless mommy and daddy and Busia and Busia and Uncle Eddie and Aunt Lisa and suzy and jenny and uncle jerry and uncle dan and curtis and uncle eugene and aunt terri and matt and aunt laurie and uncle chris and..."" etc.&nbsp; I would fall asleep with my cross wound up in my fingers, my hands clenched together, saying my prayers like a good little devout christian.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><lj-cut text=""more of the religion rant under this cut. don't read if you don't care.""></FONT> </P>
<P><FONT size=2>Every fucking night I would do that.&nbsp; Some nights I would catch myself,&nbsp; my hands slipping as I fell asleep and I would panic, clenching them back together, wide-eyed and frightened, not wanting to be smited, and I would focus my energy back to the cross and think, ""I'm so sorry lord, I'm so so sorry.&nbsp; I just wanted to say I love you and goodnight and amen... Amen.""</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I couldn't fall asleep unless I had done this.&nbsp; Every night.&nbsp; If I forgot I would pray for forgiveness for missing my prayers the night before.&nbsp; But then, this was back when I was also in the habit of kissing my parents goodnight daily, as well.&nbsp; It's something I grew out of.&nbsp; I don't know if it is possible to actually grow out of a religion, but it seems I have.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I remember going to church every Sunday.&nbsp; Getting dolled up, buckling my little mary janes and pulling on a cardigan, and sitting through the 45 minute service, my head nodding the entire time.&nbsp; I remember being baptised.&nbsp; I remember Father Jude holding me up, at age 7, and laughing at the audience of people.&nbsp; I remember being so enamored with Christ and Jesus and Mary.&nbsp; I remember saying my prayers every night.&nbsp; And some sick twisted part of me misses that.&nbsp; Some part of me, deep deep inside of my soul, misses being so innocent.&nbsp; I miss having such strong faith to fall back on.&nbsp; I miss being able to ask forgiveness for things that don't really need to be forgiven.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>And then I lost my christianity.&nbsp; I was so close to just being an atheist.&nbsp; But I gathered it back up.&nbsp; Not because I loved Jesus.&nbsp; Not because I actually believed in the miracle of the lord.&nbsp; But because I had seen the Exorcist and it had scared me silly.&nbsp; I suppose i was just never so devout to begin with.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I had always been a little off.&nbsp; I had always been into the pagan aspect of things.&nbsp; Tarot and spellcasting and energy seemed so much more logical than a man walking on water and yes, the concept of christ is a lovely thing, but it's just as absurd as anything else.&nbsp; What my problem is is that the people who find Christ to be so wonderful are actually terrible people.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Quick to condemn and quick to insult.&nbsp; They believe that they are the only ones who are right about anything ever.&nbsp; They believe that polytheistic religions are absurd.&nbsp; That the concept of any other religion is ludicrious, without looking on their own.&nbsp; Yeah, perhaps it's a little weird to think of gods dwelling among us, but isn't it also a little kooky to think that a man could bring the dead back to life and turn water into wine?&nbsp; I have no problem with Christianity.&nbsp;&nbsp;I still have beliefs that lie within it, as a matter of fact, but my problem is that Christians tend to be so closed minded.<BR><BR>My faith would probably still be fully lit if I hadn't grown up to have homosexual friends or if I had never grown up to be a tad kinky.&nbsp; Everything is wrong in Christianity.<BR><BR></lj-cut></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>So that was a tangent I hadn't even meant to go off into.&nbsp; This post was meant to simply say that Christmas no longer has anything to do with Christ.&nbsp; Not only for me, but for most of the American population.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>I am a selfish teenage girl.&nbsp; I can easily admit that I did not think about Christ once while I was downloading music onto my new iPod.&nbsp; I can also say that I did get kind of miffed at the fact that that was really the only gift I ended up recieving from anyone.&nbsp; I can say without an ounce of guilt that I was pissed because my grandmother didn't call to wish me a fucking nice christmas.&nbsp; Because Christmas is no longer about Jesus.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Jesus was the original idea for the holiday.&nbsp; Yes, yes.&nbsp; Let's celebrate the birth of our saviour.&nbsp; But people stopped caring after the first thousand years.&nbsp; Now it's a time to be with family and friends.&nbsp; A time to show your appreciation for your kin and spend fucking money on them.&nbsp; It is a time to be spoiled and selfish and it is a time to share.&nbsp; But it is not a time to think about Jesus Christ Almighty.&nbsp; Not anymore.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Sorry Christ-People.&nbsp; You lose.&nbsp; You lost a long time ago.&nbsp; People might smile and sing 'Silent Night' but they sing it with thoughts of Santa and money in their heads and hearts.&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Christmas has been corrupted by money.&nbsp; And I will be the first to say that I am perfectly fine with that.</FONT></P>

2. I never imagined having my wedding and you not being there
3. Sometimes I wish I could see you just one more time even though I hate your guts just so I could rub it in your face that your life will never be as good as mine because you are a loser, always have been and always will be.

"event","The whole time we were on holiday the boy seemed fine. I thought his medicine was really working for him. Since we have been home he has seemed out of it and down. Told me the medicine doesn't really work anymore. He has been having weird things going on. Said his finger was burning the other day then yesterday it hurt. Last night while sleeping he was holding my arm and his fingers were moving a mile a minute even though he wasn't doing it. Now this morning he is complaining that all his joints are still and hurt. I wonder if it is only this place that fucks up his brain.

Waiting for him to get out of the shower so we can go out. I need to buy computer paper. I have a paper due on Friday, I went to print it out last night and would you believe it I ran out of paper! I am nervous about the assignments I have to hand in. Brittish grading is different you can get a pass merit or distinction. They give you a guide about what entails which but I cant write an assignment while looking at guides like that. I need to just let it flow or it feels like pulling teeth."

And this morning when I wanted to come on the computer to do my homework he actually told me to do it while he was at work later cause it was more productive. Why? So he could play a video game! I was fuming and he doesn't understand why."

I think that is what I missed most while on holiday. Not that I am an alchie it is just very cozy and a weekly (if not daily) stop for Edward and I. I really wish they would stock Jack Daniels though. But then again what is the point when your in the UK supplying American wiskey when Scotland is only a few miles away and that is the home of Wiskey. Whatever it was nice.

We have only been back 28 hours and Josie is already calling. God I hate that woman. Can we have a chance to breath before you start demanding Edward's time?

The past few days I have not been sleeping well. The silence, the time when you are completely alone and have to face your fears and dreams when your lying in bed inbetween sleep and awake has been driving me insane. Why cant my brain just have a shut off valve?

Edward has been spending the past few days sleeping in very late. Like right now it is 2 in the afternoon. Tomorrow we need to be at the train by quarter past 8 in the morning. He better be prepared to wake up and I dont give a fuck how tired he is. I want to go home!"

I watched a program on Torrets. It was so interesting. The more I see these types of things the more I think I am destined to teach children with special needs. I guess we will find out.

I hate to say it but I really dont like his younger sister Jackie. I have only just met her recently even though I knew everyone else. She just seems bitchy. He even said she is acting really bad towards his mother. Last night his mother was taking her nad her friend out and while her mother wasn't looking she stole the car keys and was driving the car around the backyard. I know it is not horrible but she is old enough to know it is wrong. And Edward has told me she has wrecked a few of the families cars by fucking around in them. Cars are not toys.

Today we are supposed to be going out but it is only going ot be for like 2 hours. I WANT TO GO HOME. I want to be able to go out whenever I please. I dont want to have to wait for other people to decide they are ready.

I got an email today about room changes for one of my upcoming modules. It starts a week later then it was supposed to. Thats nice I guess. I am ready to go back though."

"event","Last night Edward and Stuart stayed up til 3 am playing Halo 2. Not wanting to look the wimp I stayed up with them even though at 11 I was struggling to keep my eyes open. This morning I woke up to screams through out the house. Some kind of drama so I stayed in bed not wanting to walk into the middle of a battlefield. When I did wake up Stuart told me I had to wake Edward up cause it was 11am and late. Granted it is later then we normally wake up but we were up to fucking 3 am for fucks sake. And it is his fault we were up that long to begin with! I wanted to tell him off but he is harmless so I refrained myself. The littlest things really tick me off lately. I dont know why. Not like my period is coming or anything.

I just keep thinking how I want to be home. I have homework to do and cant get myself to do it here. And this house is like 12 miles out of town so unless Edward's mom drives us we cant go anywhere. I get cabin fever very easily. I am like a dog. I need to go out like once a day or I start to freak out. I dont like that someone else is in control of when I can and cant go out or come home.

I am like a freak when I am on vacation. I feel like if it something I can do at home like watch tv then it isn't worth doing on vacation but we dont seem to be doing much in the way of anything. Bleh."

"event","right so I may have broken down and come back to blogging. we shall see if it lasts. Maybe it is only because I am sitting here at quarter to midnight while Stuart and Edward are playing xbox and I am bored? Maybe I actually have some shit to say. 

I dont know if anyone will read this...most likely not but whatever. So I am lame, I dont know how to make pretty layouts on livejournal since I just never bothered to learn while making all my layouts for kiwi which I dont use anymore. So you will have to bare with me and my boring layout.

Just a few minutes ago I had to first IM from someone on AIM that I dont know in ages. Of course I didn't accept the IM because I believe if it was anyone important I would already know them, but then you always wonder who it was and why they were IMing you. Hoping it wasn't some stupid perv sending porn.

I feel like I have something to say but I am sitting here with a lack of words flowing from my fingers.

Have been spending a few days with Edwards family. I always feel a little out of place around them. I am not really enjoying myself. I dont want to be a baby but they keep this house so fucking cold. For the past few days I have been wearing my coat in the house. That just doesn't fly with me. When in the house I like to wear the least amount of clothes as possible. Edward keeps asking why I dont tell anyone but the cold doesn't seem to bother anyone else so I dont want to be the nagging one. But if I get fucking Pnemonia they will be sorry.

Today Edward and I had planned to go shopping but then we stopped by Stuarts house and he came out with us. Even though we walked into stores I couldn't really shop because they were following me kind of sulking. Then they freaked out when Edward's mom asked if I bought anything and I said no and told her why. She said the girls would go shopping another day. That sounds nice and I guess I should bond with my future mother nad sisters in law but it is a scary thought as well.

One and Edward's sisters has 5 kids, one of them spend the weekend and I was told when he went back to his dads today he was talking about his Auntie Mary. That is so strange having someone call me Auntie. I have gone from having no siblings to having 4 sister in laws and 3 nieces and 2 nephews. I just cant get my mind around it sometimes."

Whenever I get really down about being apart and talk to him about it he gets really down and then I have to be the one that has it together. Why? What if I want to break down? What if I need someone to hold it together for me? He says everything seems pointless so he winds up not going to school or to work. Well I really know what pointless is. When I wake up everyday with nothing to do. I hate having to try and convince him to go to school. Why cant he just deal with it by himself?

I was laying in bed this morning thinking about when I go back to England and I am so afraid they are going to  deny my visa. I know I am just a big worry wart but I wish someone could go with me. But then once I get there I dont want someone there cause it will be my big reunion with Edward.

I was dating what looked like Joe Meyer from high school but he was Edward inside. I was looking up urinary tract infections in men for some reason. Then this guy came in like he was a teacher to show us a movie. I was cuddling with joe/edward. His sister was there annoying me. Then I was getting in the elevator with Jen and some girl passed out in it so I pushed the ambulance button but then she woke up and didn't want an ambulance. Went to the Disney store with Jen. The cops tracked us down and searched us because of the false ambulance alarm. Then I was walking somewhere and there was a kangaroo on the power lines. 

God i hope that theory that dreams are our reality isn't true because I have some fucked up reality.

And hey why do I always dream about Edward but he is in some other guys body? So far Brett, Tom L, and Joe Meyer. Weird. He would be really pissed off. But I love him not them so he doesn't need to worry."

When I am ready for bed he has already been in bed sleeping for hours. I want to get into bed and hold him until I fall asleep. I need him here."

I am pathetic there are some messages on my machine from him just saying hello when I didn't make it to the phone quite in time. I dont want to erase them. They are him. Maybe I have to go play them now..."

Why cant he just leave the past be the past and let us be the future?
How could he love me and yet pull such low blows on me?

I felt like my whole world was crumbling down on me and now I am stuck under the rubble and cant find my way out."

"event","Stuart is a weird egg. I swear he flirts with me. He has a weird obsession with becoming a part of Edwards and my relationship. He wanted me to get yahoo messanger. I didn't want to so I said my computer was to crap. He said to have Edward buy me a new computer. I said he didn't have the money he said make him sell a game he just got. He is my boyfriends friend, what does he care if I chat with him or not...he scares me. Edward thinks it is weird but it doesn't seem to really bother him."

"event","What have I done to deserve this? I swear God has it out for me. Takemy car in for a routine tire change. Right well nothing is routine with me. My tire rod is loose in the front and my shock is snapped in the back. I am supposed to go for inspection on Saturday. He is fixing hte rod which would have definitly failed me. He is leaving the shock and hopefully they dont catch it or else thats another 700 dollars I have to spend on the car.

Then I come home and Edward calls me. Josie got mad at him. She sent him home from work but before he left she hit him with a bottle. I swear I need some mob connections. I want to place a hit on Josie. I would do it myself but then all the messy jail time and stuff comes into play and we just cant have that.

Going foodshopping when my mom gets home from work. I need to pick up some toiletries. I have become such a girl it isn't even funny."

"event","I went to bed at 9 last night. I am pathetic. And what do I get for it? Here I am at6 am, wide awake with nothing to do persay. Well nothing I feel like doing.

In the 6 months I was in England I saw snow a total of 2 times. There is snow outside here. I missed the snow while I was gone. I like watching it from the warmth of my house, I like how pretty everything looks covered in it, I like playing in the snow. But I absolutely dispise driving in snow. And apparently my car does as well.

I miss Edward. I feel like I am not whole, like a huge chunk of me is missing. I know I am hiding it well. I mean what good is it for me to be here with all these people so happy to see me and show them the real me, the me that is absolutely miserable inside?"

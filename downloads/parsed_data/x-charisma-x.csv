ZOMGZZZZ!!!!!!! NEW FRIENDS ONLY ICON!!! Paint shop pro rocks. *edit 04/23/2006

Yet another live journal turning friends only.

If you want to be added, let me know (smilin_happily@yahoo.com) and I'll see what I can do. Most likely if you go to school with me you'll never get on.

I'm doing this because I don't want everyone (everyone meaning those I go to school with) to know what's going on in my personal life outside school. I have links to this journal on other sites of mine that people from school know and I just don't feel real confortable with sharing these things with others, if you know what I mean. Personally, I don't even think I owe anyone an explanation, but I put it in to avoid bitching from some who want to read and I say no.

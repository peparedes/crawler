"event","This is the year of lost. It is a sensation that I am accustomed to but, not what I anticipated now. No, not now, not at 29 with a career and bills and shit to root me where I am. It is the year of lost and regret. Regret, is also familiar, it is engrained in me because I do not act, I languish and then sink, falling fast to the bottom, heavy, aimless however always to the bottom. I cannot imagine how to escape lost or regret, and so I don't."

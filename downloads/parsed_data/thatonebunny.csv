     A whole hell of a lot of people have the wrong ideas about what happened at columbine 5 years ago today.  For one thing, they, at least Eric, didn't do it because they were bullied.  Another thing is that Eric was a genius, and not ignorant.  Eric had an unbelievably large hate for ignorance itself.  If you ever read parts of the journal that Eric kept, you would agree with me.  He saw most everybody in the world as inferior, and he didn't plan this for the school because of the students or teachers harassing him.  He just saw it as the best place to put a dent in history, as the students and faculty in the school were in close proximity to each other, and many could easily be killed by bombs, and many fleeing survivors could be shot.  Eric was a blatant psychopath, and despite what anybody may think, Eric could NEVER have been helped.  His death at columbine may have saved the lives of thousands.  Eric was more calm and calculating, and just plain de-sensitized than anybody (who is not a psychopath) could comprehend.  Dylan, on the other hand, was angry at himself for his problems.  He was a real loose cannon, homicidal, and suicidal.  
Out of the two, Dylan could have been helped.  If it weren't for Eric's plans, Dylan would probably never have exploded like he did at columbine.  
Some people don't understand that this could have been so much worse.  If Eric's master plan for the school succeeded, and if their bombs had been wired correctly, a total of about 600 or 700 deaths to faculty, students, reporters, police, and residents of the area would have been easily attained.  In short, Eric wanted to kill as many people as humanly possible.  He exclaimed on one of his videos that he was going to dwarf the Oklahoma City bombing, and that he was going to go down in history as the mastermind behind the mass killings in columbine.  Dylan did not need to die, but Eric's death probably in the end did save many, many lives.  If he had not perished, and had not columbine been the target, every year of his life would have been dedicated to planning the biggest killing by one man in history.  
In the end, this really should not have happened.  People should have seen this coming, and people should have noticed the smaller things, such as the trench coat mafia, and taken steps to stop Eric and Dylan before this happened.  It really is sad, but at least the shooting didn't happen the way it was 'supposed' to.


I left out alot of what I wanted to say, and I left out a few other things that I didn't think people would understand.  

Besides, who the fuck reads my journal anyways?"

I was hoping for alot more Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Megadeth, London After Midnight.  Bands that I have an un-healthy love for.

Oh, and I've all the sudden gotten kinda popular on DA, for me at least.  I got more hits in the past two days than I have in my first 8 months or so of being on DA.  I can thank Holly(zeriara) for that.  I love her and her art ^,,^  Ever since I started drawing, she has been an inspiration.  She's unlike most other artists I know.  She draws because she likes to, and not just to impress herself and others.  She draws what she wants and how she wants, and I envy her 1337 skillz ^,,^   I llooooove all the hits and comments I've been getting.  Comments make me draw, and I live for them.  I haven't been online through MSN or AIM for the past few days, mostly because I am talking through DA to Holly and others.  All the sudden a lil hate of DA flies away and a lil tolerence flies in.  Yay ^,,^   Oh!  And Holly drew me, and I'm in love with it!  Link!---> http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/5588157/   Urf...  I look at it like every ten mins ^,,^;    I drew her character, Holluu, the next night and I think it turned out great.  Check out my DA page to see it.  Just click that link up on the right hand corner.  Please o.o"

- Well crapmuffins...  Not much happened today!  I woke up this morning like... you know...  early.  I rolled over out of my bed and onto a bar coming out of my chair, cracking my spine, which was fun when I look back at it.  I pranced downstairs like a giddy little girl ready for another day of pretending to learn shit while I sleep and doodle.  I draw lots of stuff but it never makes it's way to DA because I can't ink worth shit and it makes me cry.   Anyways, yeah!  I compare my work too much to others, or at least some people say so.  I feel like my work gets shittier and shittier and everybody keeps getting better and better.  I'm so stressed out about nothing that I can't even draw anymore.  I don't get ideas in my little brain, and I can't think of anything even remotely creative like I used to.  I honestly feel like throwing myself onto a live grenade right now just to see how far my body parts would scatter.  Dogdammit I'm cynical."

"event","It seems the world is against me this week, including the weather.  It's been rainy and cold all week and I'm sick of it.  I want snow.  Snow is fun.  I guess I can't blame the weather on myself, but everything else, I can.

It's not so much one or two big things gone wrone.  It's one or two big things AND a bunch of small things.  At least I'm a bit more composed than yesterday.  I was a total wreck.  I actually cried yesterday.  I can't remember the last time I cried in depression.  My paranoia is emphasizing all of it too.  I think they are going to up my dosage of Paxil officially now.  I don't blame them, but I still hate the fact that I depend on pills to keep me going.  If I don't take it for a day, I get headaches, I almost pass out, and I can't focus on anything.  I just feel like sleeping all day.

UMD probably will give me shit for my class rank, which is apparently in the 20 or 30% range, but I have never gotten a grade in high school lower than a C-.  It baffles me that more than 80 percent of my dumbass school can get all A's and B's.  I've actually been good last year too.  I didn't get anything lower than a B- last year, and same for this year, but that doesn't matter because colleges don't look at senior grades.  Bah.  Damn it all.

I gotta rest for awhile.  I've been sleepy today.  I'll probably babble more later."

"event","Gwah...  I'm back in school tomrorrow after a 5 day weekend for MEA... whatever the hell that is.  I don't give a shanty about what it is.. I just care that I get a long weekend!  Woohoo!  School starts tomorrow at about noon, and that's a pretty late start.  Rock on.

Today was just like every other day this weekend.  I hanged out with friends all day and did the same stuff I have been doing for the past 5 days.  We went to Davannis, watched Jeremy and Betsy make out, played a little classic nintendo, and drove around doing really stupid things.  I just wish my friends were a little more like me.  I have to act different around my friends, and I hate it.  If I say what I want, and do what I want, people don't talk to me.  I wish so much that I didn't care, but I do, and I hate it.

Urg...  I really don't want to go to school tomorrow.  School sucks, but at least it's a short day.  If this was a full week, I would have to freak out and fake a nervous breakdown to try and get out of school for a bit.  Ryan got expelled a few days ago... lucky bastard.  Well, not so lucky I guess.  It all happened when Ryan started letting his friends draw/write on him in theatre class, and one of them wrote 'must kill all teachers', and since now all of the sudden after columbine, american society takes every single little detail so literally.  Some dumbass sees the writing on his arm and fucking reports him, and the principal actually orders Ryans car to be searched in the parking lot.  Now, Ryan has had a dinky pellet gun in his trunk for almost 2 years, and nobody cared.  Nobody cared because the fucking thing can't peirce skin, and has about the same chance of killing somebody as a sloth in a deep coma.  They saw the pellet gun in his car, and oh my fuckin god he is going to shoot up the school!  Jeez... they even say that they just want to make an example of Ryan to other kids in my school.  They feel that putting a little control and fear into students is worth ruining a life.  Ryan isn't having a good time with this.  Everything is fucking up for him, and most of his plans for graduation and college have been destroyed just because one principal wanted to make an example.  Ryan isn't the kind of kid who would run into school with a gun and shoot everybody.  Gaaaah...  most people suck you know?  Especially normal people. =P

Bah...  time to log on and talk to teh wuffie!  Buhbai."

"event","Friends came and went today.  Three of them if you give a shit.  Jeremy, Ryan, and Betsy were over today for more than a few hours.  Don't get me wrong, I don't care if they are over here or not, but there is something about everything.  It makes no sence 'something about everything', but in my mind it does, and I have no clue how to explain it.  It's like every single thought and word that comes around means so many things, and you can never tell what exactly somebody means.  It all just makes me want to drive away to some corn field and dissapear for days, or forever.  Gah...   I didn't even come close to saying what I mean, so pay no attention to what I just said..  

Ryan had to go to work at about 4PM, then it was just Jeremy, Betsy, and the invisible third wheel.  You can take a wild stab at the not so secret identity of him.  Wow, it's me.  Anyways, I'm invisible in my house.  I'm not insane yet... I mean invisible as in nobody even cares I'm there, and I don't know how to explain it, but I'm glad they don't care.  Here is a little example.  Betsy broke up with her boyfriend a few weeks ago, and now she has my best friend Jeremy.  Anyways, they start getting all riled up, and it goes from a little kiss, to full on.. whatever you wish to call it.  No, not really sex I guess given which part of the body in which organ, but still pretty damn close.  At all times, I was no more than 10 feet away, either reading, watching tv, or commiting genocide on Dynasty Warriors 4 (love that game).  They must have had a total of 4 or 5 ejaculations on one couch.  I'm not even going to talk about the condition of the couch, but that's beside the point.  They just don't care that I'm there, and they don't acknolege me in my own home.  It's almost like they come over almost every day to just talk about how much they love fucking, and finger eachother silly.  Don't get pissed if you know who I'm talking about, or you are who I'm talking about, because I'm not trying to get you mad or anything.  I'm just being a cynical bitch, and I like it.

I love being ignored, hated, feared, and above all.. not understood.
I can't explain why, but I just do.  My biggest fear in this fucking world is being normal.  I hate being like everybody else.  This is all inside me though.  I can't bring who I am out to the world all at one time.  I may dress and act a little strange, but I wish I could really just let go of society.  I still have a small instict to be accepted by the majority of humans, and it makes me want to vomit.

Since I never act the way I do on the inside, all my friends, and all who know me, are normal.  I hate normal people.  I want to know freaks who can actually give me a hand at setting society aflame....  damn normals.

I feel really pissed in general right now, and I don't know why."

Hey, ya know, lots of stuff happened between now and my last serious update, but I'm a lazy bunny and I won't even think about talking about any of it!  Anyways, here is a summary...

Good stuff happened
Bad stuff happened
Ugly stuff happened

Yeah, some summary huh?  You are probably saying to yourself ""WHATTHEFUCKISWRONGWITHTHISFUCKINGLAPINEWHOTHEHELLTOOKMYSOUPWHERESMYKEYSDAMMITDAMMITDAMMIT"", but I don't care.

I think I may be updating about my actual life sometimes, and that's saying that I actually have one, which I DO NOT!  Ahem, anyways, I went to THE MARILYN MANSON CONCERT!!!  He was less than 30 feet away from me and I think I spunked my shorts.  He is the one person in this dumbass world who has come close to inspiring me as much as the wuffie has.  Oh, by the way, during the concerts and between the fights, manson dropped a huge amount of rose confetti on the crowd, and I picked some up to send to teh wuffie!  I'm so proud that I got a souviner for my mostest favrote wruffskie in teh whoel fcuking woreld! ^.^ ...  fuck spelling.  

Manson was talking about lots of shit, and I loved every second of it!
""If God lived on earth... I would BREAK his fucking windowsss...
If God was a woman... I would fuck her *finger* in the assss...
If god was black...  I would be the white fucking satan
If god was a lie... then ROCK... IS... DEAD""
They played Rock Is Dead right after that, and it ruled.

He also stated that minnesota is a good place to be, just not in prison.  As some of you may know, he had a court case in st paul (50 miles away from me) a few weeks ago after plopping his balls on a security guards head...  I love manson ^.^
He won by the way!  Huzzah!

Friends here!  Done writing... more later!"

zell414: because
ZolaOnAOL: That was not much of an explanation.
zell414: yes it was

zell414: Excuse me?
ZolaOnAOL: You're excused.
zell414: You have some serious mental issues.
ZolaOnAOL: What makes you think I have it?
zell414: Because your logic is totally fucked up.  You say the most random things, and I personally think you are a psycotic skitzo on the verge of self destruction

Pssssh...  who wants to be normal anyways?

Today sucked.  I think it even teetered on the edge of blowing too.  First off, I haven't been getting much sleep at all for the past few days, and with it being the first week of school, the stress level is certainly up just a bit.  I usually fall asleep at about 3:30 in the morning, and I have to get up about 4 hours later.  I feel so so messed up right now.  It feels like everything in life contradicts everything else.   I think too deeply into things..  it's like shoving my head into a blender.  The first few inches are fine, but whats this?  A spinning metal thi.. *BWWWWWWRRRRIIIIISSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHH*   I can't beleive how fucked up society is today.  I want NOTHING to do with any of it.  I can't even explain why it's so fucked up, because I have no clue where to start.  It would take me days to just write down a quarter of what I want to say.  Gaaaah...  I need to calm down, but is isn't that easy anymore.  Shit happens that I can't get over, because right when I start to feel okay, I get hit with something else.  I keep telling myself that I will figure life out and get through everything, but just trying to understand why I'm telling myself gives me a headache.  I feel like that everybody is passing me while I stand alone trying to figure out why I'm here doing the things I do, and why everybody else goes around thinking the way they do.  I'm sure that nobody reading this is following me, so I'll just stop...

Gaaaaaah...  I got pulled over today!  Yes, I was speeding, and I was too busy thinking about other things to care, but wait, there's more!  It all happened when I was trying to follow ryan (who friggin does 50 on 30mph roads) to the grocery store so we (Mike, Ryan, John, and I) could get chinese food.  So I'm doing 42 to follow ryan, and this white car pulls up behind me with these little red flashy lights inside the cabin.  I thought it was some moron trying to piss me off at first, but then I saw the badge!  I then pulled over to let him by, because I was assuming he was going to stop ryan for going about 50 through a stop sign, but NO!!!  HE STOPS ME!!!  I pull over and this cop follows me to the curb.  He gets out while I bash my head into the steering wheel just to try and figure out how the fuck this happened!  He gets to my window and asks for my drivers license, and tells me I was going 42 through a 30mph zone, but RYAN...  was going at least 10mph faster while he was trying to 'lose' me.  Of course I didn't point out the cop's stupidity, because he would probably throw his gun at me to give him the right to pull me out of my car and stomp my face into the pavement.  Oh I can just see it now!
Cop: Liscense please.
Me: GAAAAAH WHATTHEFUCKAREYOUSTOPPINGMEFORGODDAMMITYOUFUCKINGMORONICPEICEOFSHI...
Cop: *'drops' his gun into the drivers lap*  He's got a gun!!! 
Me: What?!?!
Cop: *pulls the teenage ass-wipe out of his car and beats the living piss out of him*
Me: Goes to court and loses because society is fucked up.

Maybe I'm over-reacting, and I'm greatful that the cop only gave me a warning, but still...  Shouldn't they have under-cover cops doing better things than catching speeders?  Aren't there murders, gangs, and drug-cartels operating all around you?  Why no!  Just a dumb kid speeding.  Oh my god stop him!  Pfffft...  I'm going to stop rambling now.

Also...  There is somebody I miss more than my sanity right now.  I at least got to talk to him for a few minutes today, but he was having a really bad couple of days.  I tried to do my best to help him, but there is so little I can do.  I want to be there with him, but it's just so hard to talk to my parents...  I have to tell them so many things to get them to help me plan this trip to see him and buy me a ticket maybe...  I need to get over it.  It's still so hard.  I just want to be next to him, but I don't know how long it will take.  I know that someday I will find myself at his door, but there are so many variables that could make or break everything.  I also have to admit that it hurts to think about him and talk about him.  I can't even explain why.  It's just that I feel so insignificant in life..

I can't get deeper into this.."

"event","I've been real lazy with this whole live journal thing, but I plan to actually update from time to time now, hopefully daily.  Lots happened the past few weeks, and I have neither the time or the boredom to go over it now.  Do not fear!  I will tell you about it all later...

Okay, it's later, so here goes!  I'll probably get edgy half way through, so bear with me as my punctuation and grammer gradualy go to hell.  Anyways, the last half of summer for me was awsome.  I did stuff with friends about every day, and the pranking...  oh the pranking!  Twas all in good fun though.  I don't do that kind of stuff just to piss people off mind you.  I do it for justice and the un-american way! ^_-   Yeah, so there has been a little prank war going on between my friends, and Keeya's ex, who's name I shall say is Tedmund... because... well...  that's his name.  It all started the day that Keeya and Jeremy innocently TPed Tedmund's house for his insults and general ass-like behaviour... I made up a word! Yay!  Ahem...  well, Tedmund took that all serious and stuff, which he shouldn't have (Hey, I've been egged before.  TP is NOTHING!}.  Now me and my friends now have the cops after us.  Now I'll tell you why!  In the middle of this little prank war, Tedmund and his little friend Matt Lenz go to the cops, because we went 'too far' as they say.  All we did was throw flour in Tedmunds lawn, while HE slashed Keeya's tires!  This is totally un-just if you ask me!  Ugh...  it is just so fucked up that I'm not even going to go any farther into the subject.  At least the cops still don't know who I am.

Anywho, a big milestone came and went this past week.  I came out to a friend.  Feels good to finally be myself infront of at least one person.  It was real akward and weird when I did it.  He is my closest friend and I told him ONLINE!  Gah!  I can't beleive myself sometimes, but it all worked out okay.  The next day we talked a little about it and stuff, and he kept saying that he can't beleive I'm gay, because I don't really 'ACT' like it.  I was about to stab him, but he was driving, and that would have probably killed me too.  He also kept thinking I was joking, and it took me the entire fucking day for him to figure out I was serious.  He is fine with it though, and we still do stuff together almost everyday.  I just wish I had enough courage to come out to the world, and more importantly my family.  First off, my brother is a fucking nazi hatemonger, so I could care less about his fucking opinion.  My parents however...  I don't know where they stand with accepting gays in the community, and I hate to say it, but I need their money for college and other things.  If they blow up and disown me or something, I'll turn into a homeless peice of dirt in some alley way after I can't get into college from a lack of money.  Urf...  I really do need to come out to the world some day...

Blarghrargh!  They are making the school say the pledge of alligence now!  I can't beleive it...  if anybody gives me shit for not standing up and reciting that little poem like a dumbass blind lemming, I will shove my converse up their candy asses.  Ahem... on a seperate note... I'm so looooonnnneeellllyyy!  Somebody talk to me @.@    I miss my wuffie most of all...  I haven't talked to him in the longest time, and each time I think about him, it hurts...  It's so complicated.  I really really love him, but then theres...     its too depressing to talk about it.. im done."

"event","Today was fuuuuun...  I woke up pretty early.  I have no clue exactly what time, but I know it was around noon.  I did nothing for a long time, till Jeremy called and told me we should do something later, so after dinner he called me back and said the plan was to rent a movie and watch it at my house with Sam and Keeya.  Keeya is the girl who Jeremy has a huge crush on, but can't figure out that she is taken by some sophomore in Cali.  Anyways We went to hollywood video, and rented The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Great movie I thought.  Very disturbing :D  I loved the scene with the meathook and the corpse in the freezer.  The part where leatherface jumps out and nails that fat guy in the wheelchair with a chainsaw was cool too.  It's a classic :D

After the movie, Jeremy, Sam, Keeya, and I all went out for a drive.  We stopped at a grocery store to pick up some flour to dump on some guy's lawn that Keeya didn't like.  She is fun :D  We also TPed some guys house, but it's all in fun.  Oh, and before we used the flour on the lawn, we drove into a parking lot and had a flour fight.  I'm all white right now @.o  I got Jeremy with a huge handfull though, so I wouldn't say I lost ^.^

Oooi...  I got home at about 1 in the morn, and got on furc.  Thats about it.  Yeah, this was a crappy entry, but I don't care.  Oh, and did I tell you that I love it when people comment on my journal entries?  Just do it!  Keep me happy!"

"event","It's hard to write about your 'day' when your morning is dusk.  I woke up at 10pm and layed in bed for quite awhile, seeing as it's the first time I can since 5 days ago.  I usually wake up at 9pm and go to work at Mendota Graphics, a small printing company.  We do everything from stickers to roadsigns.  I stay there till 6am running two giant million dollar xerox docutechs (printers), putting out stacks of paper every half hour.  It's a real slacker job when the machines aren't being fussy.  When they are fussy, they are a huge huge pain to deal with.  I was about to go at Doc1 (the oldest docutech) with a crowbar, but held myself back and saved the fatal blow for the tech guys who were SUPPOSED to fix it.  Anyways, I spend most of my time there doodling, listing to music, and talking online via my phone, which is not that easy to do >.o  It's all okay though, exept last night my mp3 player decided to break itself.  Now I have to buy a new one x_x.  I spent that night listening to 93X with DeadEric on the radio.  His playlist is so damn small!!! He always repeats at least one song every hour.  I also doodled a new bunny in a style that is pretty new to me.  It's like loony-toonish combined with ren and stimpy.  It's not done, but I'll upload it to my deviant art account soon enough.

So when I got up, I went downstairs and watched robot wars on tech tv for an hour, then watched Behind The Music That Sucks.  That has to be one of the most hillarious shows out there.  They made fun of William Shatner and his very short music career, the one hit wonder chumbawumba, and some old shockrocker who I can't remember the name of...  it was the funniest one and I can't remember his name >.<   After all that, I came upstairs to write in this thing, and here I am... Hi!  I'm gonna go now >.>"

No, I don't want to see horny girls on webcams, buy vitamins that will make me buff as fucking superman, go on a 'free' dream vacation, or order new drugs to make my cock big enough to squash a bus!!!  For fucks sake!!!

Random babble...  It's so fun.  Especially at 8AM after you get home from the nightshift!  It must be all the caffine, but I feel ultra worked up right now.  I should be dead tired after being awake (more or less) for about 24 hours, but no, I'm sitting here twitching like a crack addict and listening to Devo.  What the fook.

I'm staying awake for at least another hour so I can get a chance to talk to the wuffie before he leaves for band camp.  His recent journal updates remind me why I quit band, well, that and I really really really really sucked at it.  I couldn't play the trumpet to save my life, or anybody else's for that matter.  I blew *snicker* oi...  Anywho, I need to figure out if anybody reads this, so if you see this post, reply to it for my sake.  c'mon... humor me.  GRAAAW!  I'm so lonely x.x  I wish I lived anywhere but here, except for any place that is actually worse than where I am now of course.  I'm not stupid ^_-

Todays plans are as follows!!! (holy monkeys roasting on a pike... I really am bored to list this)
Me, Jeremy, Sam, and possibly Andy are going to rent a movie at blockbuster and watch it in Sam's home theatre.  Sam's theatre is huge.  It's got about 10 or 15 leather lazy boy chairs on sort of a stadium seating, where each chair in front of another chair is lower, so you can see.  It also has a huge projection screen that almost rivals that of a small movie theatre screen.  His house is freakin amazing.  He even has cameras at each door so you can talk to somebody at the front door and let him/her in the house with the press of a button.  However, he drives an old volvo stationwagon while I drive a luxury sedan.  Hey, I need ONE thing to brag about to him don't I?

Wooooo!  I got my paycheck from work!  Four weeks of the nightshift payed off!  I have to quit next week to get back in the rythem for school though.  

Okay, next random thing to state is that a friend and I are probably going to make our very own dream for furcadia!  Of course it's going to be in FurN and of course there is going to be a gothic element to it, but we plan on making it stand out... using our top secret plan that we have...  *cough*  It's probably going to be a gothic version of gayisle, but, meh.  We have other ideas too.  Anywho, progress on that will be posted in my live journal as things happen.

And why the hell are there so many goddamn colleges!?!?  They should have no more than 100 colleges in this country.  50 of them would be for general learning and majors, while the other 50 would be for more technical things, such as computer technology (programming, networking, and the works), arts, and clown school.  Damn this country and the horse it rode in on.  I'm moving to Bogota!  See how many colleges they have.  Oh, and another thing that messes up this whole college thing for me...  My high school.  Edina High School has the biggest curve in class rank and gpa in the history of mankind (probably).  I got just 3 D's in sophomore year, and nothing but A's and B's this year (it must be those weird pills the shrink gave me @_o) .  Because of those three D's, I am in the 75% of the class rank, and my gpa is something around the lines of 2.3!  Again, damn this country and the horse it rode in on!  I swear a chimp could run this country better than Mr. ImPresidentBecauseMyDaddyRiggedTheElection *cough*   Oh, and fuck the pope too.

Lets see, I also got a job, which takes up most of my time now.  I work in my uncles printing press, where I stand over gigantic xerox machines and feed them paper when they beep at me.  Sometimes, like tonight, they all totally break down and I get to go home!  They are complete peices of shit I tell you.  One of 'em fuckin burnt my fingers when I tried to un-jam it...  Grr...

I'm tired of being negative!  Good things happened too!  Today I had a little free time, so Me and Jeremy got together and watched a movie.  Queen of the Damned is exelent O_O  Screw blockbuster, I'm keeping this one.  Then I helped clean the marker off of his vandalized car, but I'll just say, ""what goes around, comes around.""  Hmm... I just realized that my grammer/spelling sucks, but at least it's not at the point where it is unreadable... Unreadable is my handwriting.

*sigh* I'm so looonneeelllyyy...  I guess that's why I'm typing in this thing in the first place.  There is somebody that I haven't talked to in a few days whom I miss and love a whole hell of alot.  I wish I didn't have the nightshift at that printing press, so I could actually be here and talk with him...  I love him so much...  but somehow, right now, I feel that I'm causing more trouble and more pain for him.. more than he would have if I never existed.  It's all very complicated... I guess. 

Well, I'm going to end this here before I make myself more depressed/peeved/paranoid/lonely.

E-Mail me at zell414@hotmail.com for commisions...  I need a shove to get out of my art slump."

"event","AH GOD DAMMIT!!!  I FUGGIN MISSED IT!!!  My one chance to go to Ozzfest and actually see Marilyn Manson for the first time blew up!  I was going to drive to wisconsin with a few friends and catch it there, but all of the sudden none of my friends can go, which leaves me no chance of affording everything by myself.  That is the second time this summer that they have done this!  I'm tired of being screwed over by the same people over and over again! ARG!

And what also sucks, is that I have suddenly lost what little artistic talent I have.  And this coming after a huge slump makes it worse.  It better be temporary or I will have to go play chicken with trucks on the highway. 

Meeeehhhhhh...   I'm just having a bad week in general I guess.  My chronic paranoia is also acting up @_O  See, I'm not crazy or anything.  Just imagine always thinking that your friends are doing stuff behind your back, and that your one true love is avoiding you.  Gah... it's all so weird because half of me knows that it's not happening, but the other half is full of 'what if'  I guess I just miss him alot.  I haven't seen or heard of him for the past few days.  I worry to easily I guess."

"event","Woah... I haven't posted in this thing for awhile, mostly because nothing at all is going on.  It's a usual boring summer and that is all there is to it.  I'm kinda down right now, as it seems almost everyone I talk to is mad at me and won't tell me what I did.  Gwah...  I could just be paranoid, but I don't care. 
Ack.. I'm so friggin lonely x.x  Somebody talk to me without getting pissed, annoyed, sad, or sarcastic.  I've also been in a huge slump as far as art goes.  I still have to finish inking a doodle for a somebody very close to me, but I never get to it >.<  I either forget, or remember just as I'm going to bed.  
La la la la la la la...  I'm bored too if you couldn't guess, so I'm going to stop the babble and work on that doodle."

"event","Wow!  Lookit!  I made a new pic for my live journal.  Ain't it cool that I use a webcam instead of a scanner to be different?  Fine... I don't have a working scanner, but once I get a double ended usb cable, which I can't find, I can scan all my stuff.  Till then, it's the webcam's job.

Anyways, today was... a good day.  Not a very interesting way to say it, but it works doesn't it?  I slept in till 4PM like I always do, and went out to a mall with Sam, Jeremy, and Mike.  We stopped in at hot topic to kill some time before LXG (League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) started.  We found a hat and tanktop that made mike look EXACTLY like kid rock.  It was freaky like the twilight zone.  The movie was really good actually.  It had a vampire in it... n'stuff.  Dr. Jekyll kicked ass.  That invisible guy is so lucky... wish I could run nude through a 100 meter sub without being noticed.

I got home just in time to catch my mate online, so I'm all happy n stuff right now ^.^  Wish I could be there with him...  I'm still working out a time to go visit him, and I can't wait till I can finally really kiss him.  *sigh* I day-dream about it all day every day.  I love him so so so much ^_^ 

It's late, and I need sleep, so taa for now!  *falls over unconscious*"

"event","Today was... great?  No... Very great!  I think?  Anyways, I found out today that my dog, Lucca the French Poodle, does not have any more cancer in her body!  We must have caught it early, because the vet specialist person guy said that the type of cancer that she had was ""Very Aggressive"", meaning that there was sure to be many more tumors caused by the one they took out of her last week during a surgery to unclog an anal-sac.  The anal-sac, if you want to know... considering the name, you don't, but I will tell you anyway!  The anal-sac... *giggle* Anal...  Ahem...  The anal-sac is an organ located near the anus that a canine uses to mark territory.  Eh... bad news is that my parents are going to put her through chemotherapy just in case.  The vet says it will be a painful process and some of her fur will fall out, and grow back white(she has black fur), so she will end up looking like a dalmation poodle.  Well, the good news is that she will be okay if the chemo doesn't kill her.
I don't want to talk about that anymore, so I will talk about happy things! Yay! I got to talk to a furre whom I love more than the universe today, so that really helped to make my day just that much more great.  I met him in furcadia over a year ago, and we have grown on eachother since that day.  He is so perfect in every way, I can't beleive it ^.^  *sigh* I'm in love ^_^

Anywho, I have to get a good nights rest for tomorrow, as greg is visiting today for a few hours before I have to drive him to his job.  He is an instructor at the karate place where I used to go when I was but a wee lad.  I started karate two years before he did, but I quit after blue belt, and he stayed in.  He got quite a ways didnt he?  He is like a triple super blackbelt or whatever, and he teaches the class now.  Wow :p    We are probably going to just play a little Battlefield1942 over the LAN I set up downstairs.  We actually use a mod called ""Desert Combat"".  It's like BF1942 only with modern vehicles and weapons.  Tis quite fun.  If only I could teach greg how to fly the helicopters in game, we would start to actually get decent at the mod :p

Gwaaahhhh... soo tired...  I want to stay up and talk to a few people, but I can't.  I actually have to get up out of bed tomorrow.. er... this morning.  *whimpers* I miss my furre whom I love more than the universe...  I hope I can get online tonight and talk to him...

Anyways, g'night and g'morning everyone!  *falls over unconscious*"

"event","Last week was alright. I think I'm still feeling a little aimless since I don't have an event I'm training for or a plan to follow. I'm still eyeballing the Clemson Triathlon (which is now less than 2 months away - oops!) in July, so hopefully that will help get me on track. We shall see.

I'm still working through my PT, doing my exercises, and feeling some improvement. I still have some twinges of IT band pain when I run, but it isn't as sore for as long afterwards... so, yay? 

<u>Monday - rest</u>
Monday was just busy. Didn't get away to lift like I'd hoped.

<u>Tuesday - #10kTuesday with Pint & Pie crew</u>
It was Route #3, my least favorite because it includes a challenging hill and uneven sidewalks on a busy-ish road. Makes the stroller extra challenging. But I got to sport my kickass new SweatyBand, so that made it all worth it. ;)

<u>Wednesday - short neighborhood bike ride with trailer</u>
I took my first short ride around the neighborhood with the bike trailer & D attached. It's tough pulling that extra ~30lbs up the hills! I figured I'd practice in anticipation of riding downtown to Artisphere during the weekend.

<u>Thursday - rest</u>

<u>Friday - yoga and neighborhood walk</u>
Finally made it to yoga at lunch - I can tell I haven't been in a while. Things are tiiiight. 

Also, Scott and I pushed D on his scooter for a half mile around the neighborhood that evening. Such fun! :) 

<u>Saturday - neighborhood run/walk (2mi)</u>
Didn't get out til late and just wanted to do *something* so I ran a little bit but mostly pushed D in the stroller around the neighborhood.

<u>Sunday - bike to and from Artisphere downtown</u>
I put D in the bike trailer to get to and from Artisphere on Sunday. My chorus performed at noon on the Peace Center amphitheater stage, then we walked around a bit before heading home. It went great, but man what a workout! Thankfully it was a beautifully cool morning/day so it wasn't too bad to ride."

"event","Oops, my weekly updates have slacked!

Summary: still dealing with IT band issues, and have started physical therapy this week. I have been consistent in my #10kTuesday runs, even while traveling for work last week, and I've been biking a good bit most weekends. Other than that, I've not been doing much. Working on being better because I KNOW I feel better (mentally and physically) when I get consistent workouts.

Physical therapy evaluation revealed that my hips are likely out of alignment (slight twist) resulting from slight scoliosis (I knew this was an issue already) + child birth (which both expanded my hips and wrecked my core strength). This misalignment, combined with my lack of yoga lately, has caused leg tendons & muscles to tighten up and give me the knee pain I've been having, along with some sciatic pain.

Long story short: I'm all out of whack. 

Good news: it's relatively easy to fix! I'll be going to PT twice a week for about a month, where she'll be giving me slight adjustments on my hips, and we'll be working on building strength in the stabilizer muscles to help hold things in place. Plus this gives me extra motivation to get back on the Yoga Friday train."

"event","Still battling IT band issues. Went to the on-site nurse practitioner last week, had an X-ray on Thursday (just to be sure nothing was broken - nope), and will likely get 'prescribed' some physical therapy to help. I've been better about foam rolling this weekend, so hopefully that will do the trick. ERGH. I'm so frustrated with this stupid ""injury"".

<u>Monday - rest</u>
After a tough ride on Sunday, and everything still hurting, I decided a rest day was the best plan.

<u>Tuesday - #10kTuesday</u>
Forecast for rain in the evening, plus wanted to be home this evening, so decided against the Pint & Pie run. Got the #10kTuesday done before lunch and beat the rain! Total of 6.2 miles at average 9:00 min/mi moving pace! SO CLOSE to sub-9. I did have a few twinges of IT band pain, so it seems the issue has not resolved itself. :/ MOAR foam rolling.

<u>Wednesday - <s>lift</s></u>
Knee hurts. Also stomach hurts. Bleh.

<u>Thursday - bike</u>
Rode the Sherman College loop with Megan - felt great and averaged 14.3 mph for the 14.4 mile loop!

<u>Friday - rest</u>

<u>Saturday - mountain bike</u>
Took a trip up to Pleasant Ridge with Scott and D. Took turns doing loops around - I did two full JFA trail loops, crashed a bunch on the first one but managed to clear everything on the second!
Loop 1 in 37:26
Loop 2 in 37:41

<u>Sunday - bike</u>
Scott and I took a ride with D to downtown to watch the Cycling Criterium National Championships - it was fun! D loved ringing the cowbell for the cyclists. We rode a total of 19.4 miles."

#10kTuesday

Tried out running in my older shoes for #10kTuesday with the Pint & Pie to see if the IT band would be happier, and lo & behold, it was. Not 100% but certainly no where near the pain I'd had 2 days prior. I hate to think my pretty new shoes are causing all of my pain, so I'm not going to get rid of them just yet, but it's certainly concerning that the first time I run in different shoes (other than my new ones) I have significantly less pain. We'll see.

Regardless, I did another 10kTuesday with D in the stroller - love my weekly runs with him. :)

<u>Wednesday - bike</u>
Nice ride with the ladies through USC Upstate - 10.5 miles in the lovely spring weather!

<u>Saturday & Sunday - Women's Mountain Bike Clinic</u>
Over the weekend I attended a Women's Mountain Bike Clinic at <a href=""http://www.mulberrygap.com/"">Mulberry Gap</a> in Ellijay, GA (north GA mountains). The clinic was lead by Sue Haywood, a retired pro mountain bike racer, with assistance from Meredith Erlewine and Shanna Powell.

<i>Sue Haywood</i>

The Mulberry Gap retreat center was awesome - multiple small cabins and campsites with bath houses and a main lodge where family-style meals are cooked and served every day. It was simply amazing. I was in a shared cabin with 4 other ladies - reminded me of summer camp. :)

<b>Saturday - Skills Practice</b>
We spent most of the day on Saturday practicing basic mountain bike skills. First practiced on flat ground doing front & back wheel lifts, level lifts (i.e. a ""jump""), rock-dodge maneuvers, and other bike-handling skills. After lunch we moved over to the skills park to practice getting up and over boxes or other obstacles, worked on managing ""drops"" and ""skinnies"", and other fun things. We worked up to a 13"" drop!

We also headed out on the short trail that looped around the retreat site to practice certain sections. One was a tough steep switchback followed immediately by a wood ramp & drop-off... I went over the bars on the first attempt but went back a second time and got through it! :) I was really happy about that.

<b>Sunday - Trail Ride</b>
After breakfast we headed out for a group trail ride. It was estimated to take ~3 hours for us to complete, but that was a bit too optimistic. We got shuttled most of the way to the trail head, but still had a 2-mile climb on gravel roads to kick things off. Halfway up was a nice waterfall, and at the top was a beautiful overlook of the mountains.

<img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/littlechemist/3129645/111613/111613_600.jpg"" alt="""" title="""">

First trail was Bear Creek - a short bit of single track with some really hard switch-backs (I walked them - MOST of us walked them). The group stopped there for about an hour to ""session"" on the switchbacks. Some were able to finally clear them, which is awesome - these girls have guts. A small group of us wanted to go on ahead along the trail (knowing we weren't up for the switchback practice), so we headed out with Shanna as our guide. After the remainder of Bear Creek, with lots of great descents on single- and double-track, a good number of water crossings, we came to the start of Pinhoti 1 trail. This kicked off with a killer single-track climb, but then we were rewarded with an awesome descent. End of P1, had some gravel connector roads, then started off Pinhoti 2. A little bit of climbing to start P2, but not nearly as bad as what we'd already done. The rest was downhill until we got to the gravel road back to camp.

"event","Two things over the past week are making me re-evaluate goals/plans:

1) IT Band issues. Yep, they're back. NOT HAPPY. I felt some tightness after my run on Sunday a week ago, but ignored it. Felt it really bad on #10kTuesday, so I rested for the remainder of the week. Ran yesterday (Sunday) and it came right back. Need to give it some attention and figure out how to fix it! However, this has removed my desire to try to PR in the Reedy River 10k at the end of the month. This is clearly going to take some time to fully heal.

2) My chorus will NOT be going to International competition in the fall of 2017. We placed third in this weekend's contest. We also are unlikely to win next year (the chorus we'd be up against is <i>really really good</i>. Like, REALLY really. So... we're likely looking at trying to be at the 2019 (?!) International Competition, so that's one less thing I need to plan around. Silver lining of not doing as well as we'd hoped. 

With that being said, I am now thinking I need to postpone Half IM attempts until next fall (2017) and then go for Full IM the following year (2018). This year will be a year of rebuilding. Likely another half marathon in the fall, shorter triathlons over the summer, building up bike distance, etc. I feel like the progression into half IM shape would just be too quick right now, especially with the IT band issues. 

Anyway, here's the week's report:

<u>Monday - lift</u>
Great way to start off the week. Felt strong and motivated. I think they key for me is getting in early (before lunch and before the lunch crowd starts rolling in) so I have the gym to myself and can focus. Increased weight (bolded) on a couple of exercises!

3x10 everything:
OH press (One-arm) - 30#
Chest fly (one-arm) - 20#
Hip adduct - 25#
Glute raise - 25#
-----
<b>Squat rack - 2x20#</b>
Tri pull-down - 35#
-----
Preacher curl - 10#
<b>OH pull-down - 40#</b>

Calf raise - 55#

<u>Tuesday - #10kTuesday with @pintandpie</u>
Great run, but I could tell the IT band was still giving me problems. I finally warmed up and got moving OK, but it hurt baaaad when I stopped. :(

<u>Wednesday thru Saturday - rest</u>
I planned to run Sunday after contest, so wanted to give my knee a chance to rest. 

<u>Sunday - Salem Lake run w/ Angelina</u>
Beautifully cool morning to run around Salem Lake. Felt good starting out, kept a shockingly good pace for being off-road with the stroller, but around the 10k mark my knee had had it so we walked the last ~mile to the car. Still, such a nice morning to run and great to catch up with my bari buddy! :)

Running: 11mi / 2 days
Biking: 28.5mi / 2 days
Strength: 0x
Rest: 3x

Didn't do a whole lot this past week, and I hate feeling aimless (training without a purpose) - this always happens between races! Anyway, here's how the week went down...

<u>Monday - rest day</u>
Travel back from VA beach, and legs were still VERY sore.

<u>Tuesday - #10kTuesday in two parts</u>
Since the legs were still sore, I took #10kTuesday easy and did it in two parts. First was 3.2 miles at lunch, average 9:27 pace. Second was with the Pint & Pie group after work, ran with D in the stroller on the ""hard hilly"" route #4 - 3.1 miles, average 9:35 pace (not bad!). Legs felt better by the end of the day, but still sore.

<u>Wednesday - bike ride</u>
Residual soreness in hamstrings, otherwise legs weren't too bad. Rode the Sherman College loop with Scott, total 14.4 miles at average 13.9 mph. It was windy, too!

<u>Thursday - rest</u>
Busy day at work and I knew I would be biking the next day, so took the day off.

<u>Friday - Mountain Biking</u>
Good Friday = holiday from work, but daycare was open so we took D in for the day and went mountain biking at DuPont State Forest. It was such a great day! We rode a bunch of trails and I felt really good about both technical and physical skills. Yess! I'm excited for my Women's Mountain Bike Clinic coming up in 2 weeks. We did a total of 14 miles, averaged 7 mph, and 1,600 feet of climbing. Not too shabby!

<u>Saturday - rest</u>
Had hoped to run, but D decided to shift his napping schedule and I wasn't able to get out. 

<u>Sunday - run</u>
The rain held off so that I was able to get in a run in the afternoon after Easter Sunday at church. Just did some loops in the neighborhood, felt difficult, but was just an average run. Glad to get in some miles though - 4.6 miles at 9:23 pace."

"event","""[...] often go awry.""

That pretty much sums up this race experience. I've never had a race where <s>so many things</s> everything went wrong.

I knew heading into the weekend that the weather was looking less than favorable - a cold front was coming through, and there were fairly high chances of rain. Ok, cold rain. Sucks, but I can deal. I kept an eye on the forecast in the days leading up to the race, hoping for some improvement, but there really wasn't any. It was going to rain. It was going to be in the 40s. It was going to be incredibly windy (20-40mph).

Then Saturday evening, after a day of brewery tours and a dinner of gourmet grilled cheese (we went to <a href=""http://thebirchbar.com/"">The Birch</a>, a well-known bar with specialty gourmet grilled cheese menu), I felt awful. I think a combination of wide varieties of beers (not large quantities, just lots of different kinds), paired with a heavy dinner, and possibly a little bug going around (two others in our party had stomach issues too) made for a disastrous combination. I puked up <i>everything</i> on Saturday night and went to bed feeling weak and queasy.

Sunday morning, instead of a nice pre-race breakfast, I didn't feel like eating anything for fear of upsetting my stomach more. We left the rental condo by 5:45am to find a parking spot. We barely got one in the lot near the finish line (by ""near"" I mean a half mile walk). Stayed in the car as the wind and rain picked up, then we had to walk about a mile to the start line.

It was miserable.

COLD. Ridiculously windy. Rain rain rain. 

I was in wave 3 (projected finish time of 1:52 - my goal was 1:50) and got there just as the first wave started. The driving cold rain was relentless for the first half hour or so. It finally dissipated and we got on a more inland, tree-sheltered road so the wind wasn't as bad. I actually felt pretty good for miles 2-5. I warmed up, running was ok, felt like I had a good pace. Hey, this might not be so bad!

I crossed the 6 mile mark and we turned onto the point of the peninsula. The wind picked up. I got COLD. I tried to eat some of my gummies, but I could barely manipulate the package with my now re-frozen hands. My stomach still didn't feel great but I needed something. Miles 7 and 8 were bad. I walked a lot. The wind was awful. I was calorie-depleted.

I got a little boost around mile 9... I guess by then I at least felt like I could finish the race. The good feeling didn't last long though, and I was back to just being tired and wanting to be done. Miles 10-12 were tough because they were a re-trace back down the same street we'd come up a couple hours before. We finally made the turn onto the boardwalk, got BLASTED by wind as we ran along the coast in view of the ocean. The final stretch down the boardwalk was a sprint. I wanted to be DONE so badly. I could see King Neptune's statue in the distance.

I didn't look at my watch the entire race. I knew it wasn't going to be good. Any hopes of making my goal time had gone out the window in the first few miles (heck, probably before I even started the race).

Official time: 2:01:22

Not even under the 2-hour mark. 

I know, considering all I'd fought against, that I should be happy just to have finished. And I am glad I finished. But it wasn't the race I wanted, wasn't what I'd trained for.

"event","[Monday] The weekend's plans are up in the air at the outset - lots going on, questionable weather - will get in what I can.

Well, that turned out to be true (plans up in the air) but weather wasn't the issue. Scott and I got in a nice road bike ride on Saturday morning, and I didn't do anything on Sunday since I was not feeling great. I think it's just allergies, not actual sickness, because I don't feel all that bad, I just have some post-nasal drip and currently am on Day #2 without a voice. I figured it would be best to not over-stress myself with a long run, but so far the rest day hasn't helped my symptoms! Grrr.

Skipped the abs because I should have time to do a short but all-ab workout tomorrow. Whee!

<u>Tuesday - #10kTuesday with @pintandpie</u>
#doitforthehashtag
#10kTuesday

Another gorgeous Tuesday evening for #10kTuesday, the last 3 miles with the @pintandpie run group. PLUS I had D with me in the stroller - he loved it! I was pretty proud that I stuck with the top 5 out of ~20ish people who were doing the run, despite having already done 3 miles AND having the stroller the whole time. 

First 5k @ 9:14/mi avg moving pace
Second 5 @ 9:14/mi avg moving pace
[HOLY CRAP how's that for consistency? I didn't even realize it until just now!]

After the run, I picked up a pizza from Sidewall and took it home for dinner. Such a great evening!

Oh, and I skipped my ab workout during the day because I was so busy with work stuff!

<u>Wednesday - cross-train</u>
Beautiful beautiful day for a bike ride! Megan and I did the Sherman College loop, 14.5 miles at just under 14mph - felt good, though I could tell my legs were tired. 

<u>Thursday - 10 x 400 5k pace</u>
Originally planned to do this on the treadmill as usual. Then I thought ""hmm, maybe I'll do a warmup outside then come in to do the intervals"" since it was so nice out. Once I was out, though, I did not go back in. It was interesting trying to do these intervals outside! I also had some stomach cramps - I think my big lunch + dehydrated + warmer temps = did not feel good. So some of my miles towards the end were slower than I would have liked, but overall I'm happy with how this run went! My speed splits were generally between 7-7:30, with the first one at 6:32 (?!). A little slower than they are on the treadmill, but the heat and wind probably played role. Not too concerned!

<u>Friday - rest</u>
Decided that I wouldn't even attempt yoga today - might go for a short walk (or several throughout the day) but I've got a lot of work to catch up on today. 

<u>Saturday - <s>3m race pace</s> bike ride</u>
Scott and I went for a road ride in the morning. Beautiful day. We'd originally planned mountain biking, but turns out I snapped a spoke the last time I rode (how I did that without noticing, I have no idea). So road bike it was! Got in 27 miles.

<u>Sunday - <s>12m run</s> nothing</u>
Rest."

<u>Monday - <s>stretch & strengthen</s></u>
Left work early due to icy conditions and Dargan's daycare closing, so didn't get to work out.

<u>Tuesday - 4.5 m run</u>
I very nearly skipped out on this run because of pure laziness, but I am SO SO GLAD I didn't. After yesterday's disgusting freezing rain and ice, today it was sunny and mid-50s. Incredibly gorgeous! Got total of 4.6mi @ 8:48 avg moving pace. Not as fast as before but a good solid pace for a mid-week run.

<u>Wednesday - 40 min tempo</u>
I was a little bit bummed to have to do a treadmill workout with the weather being so nice (ok, I could have done it outside, but I didn't feel like thinking that much today - tempo runs are hard to do outside!). I hopped on the 'mill and got it done:

15 min warmup @ 6.0 mph
0.5 mi @ 6.7, 6.9. 7.1, 7.3
2 min @ 7.8

Then headed outside for the cooldown portion - just a loop around the parking lot, 0.7mi @ 9:10. It's SO NICE OUTSIDE. I ran in shorts and a tank top. 

Total workout = 4.4 miles

<u>Thursday - cross-train</u>
Got to bike ride at lunch with Scott today - lovely weather and just an all-around great ride! Also nice to ride together for once :) Got 14.3 miles @ average 14.7mph, not bad speed for as little as I've been riding lately.

<u>Friday - <s>yoga</s></u>
Worked from home due to Dargan's appointment, so no yoga.

<u>Saturday - <s>5 m pace</s></u>
All-day chorus coaching with only a 45 minute lunch break, no time to squeeze in the run. I was bummed, but I was also exhausted from the long day!

<u>Sunday - 10 m run</u>

This run felt oddly easy! I guess 2 days of rest leading up to it helped. Scott followed me on his bike with Dargan in the trailer, so it was nice to have a bit of distraction during the run. Just did an out-and-back on the Swamp Rabbit towards Greenville. Turn-around at the old train car at Sulphur Springs was almost perfectly half-way (0.1 mile short) so an added loop in the neighborhood at the end was all I needed to round out the run. The weather was awesome, I was able to run in shorts & t-shirt. Averaged 9:39/mi for the run - woohoo! Feeling really good about the race in just 4 weeks!!"

<u>Tuesday - cross-train</u>
Planned a ride outdoors with Megan, but the cold misty rain just made it not doable. I hopped on the indoor bike in the gym and, over an episode of Law & Order, I got 10 miles in 45 minutes. Not great but not terrible.

<u>Wednesday - <s>40 min tempo</s> rest</u>
Just too much going on at work, couldn't get away.

<u>Thursday - <s>4</s> 2.8 m run</u>
I again missed my lunch workout but escaped the desk early to get in a run before I had to leave to pick up D from daycare. Only had time for quick one, but the sunny weather couldn't be refused! Did 2.8 miles around work at average 8:43/mi moving pace.

<u>Friday - <s>yoga</s></u>
Newp. No time for this one either. 

<u>Saturday - <s>rest</s> 5.7 m run</u>
Had time to get out and get some miles in before we left town for the day. It was chilly, in the mid-30s, but sunny and really nice during the run. I ran out through Green Valley then returned via Old White Horse Rd. Felt really good throughout the run and would have gone farther if I'd had the time. Avg. 9min pace.

<u>Sunday - <s>8 m run</s> bike</u>
Got the chance to head out on the road bike in the afternoon. I felt really off at the beginning and started to cut the ride short, but then did an extra loop right before I reached home. Glad I pushed for the extra distance, but also glad I didn't do my original planned route. 25.5 miles @ 13.9 mph average moving speed."

Not even going to break it out by day - did zilch last week. Still fighting this cold / sinus infection, felt like it got worse last week, and I was not about to risk setting myself back from recovery. I'm still not 100% but I'm good enough to hopefully start back at the plan this week. 

The weather is a challenge - got 5-6"" of snow and ice over the weekend - but thankfully the fitness center is getting equipment installed slowly but surely, so I can actually do some workouts inside (YAY). I've become a bit of a weenie with the cold weather, so I need to toughen myself back up (mentally and physically). 

Hoping for a better week this coming week!"

"event","Well this week was just BLAH. Between me being sick with a stomach bug, then Dargan being sick with RSV, then me being sick AGAIN (this time a cold/sinus thing), it just was not in the cards for me to get anything truly productive (training-wise) done this week. Hoping for better soon!

<u>Monday - <s>strength & stretch</s></u>
Took a rest day to make sure my tummy is back to 100%. DO NOT WANT to re-upset it. :( 

<u>Tuesday - <s>3.5mi run</s></u>
Dargan home sick, so had to stay at home with him, plus my tummy troubles came back. 

<u>Wednesday - <s>cross-train</s></u>
Home with sick baby again. :(

<u>Thursday - <s>speedwork: 6x400 5k pace</s> 3.9mi run</u>
Scott's home with D today, so I am at the office and got out at lunch for a nice run. I almost didn't go because I've got some serious post-nasal drip going on, but I'm hoping the fresh air did me some good. Suuuuper happy with my pace, too - 8:52 min/mi Avg Moving Pace!

<u>Friday - <s>yoga</s></u>
Post-nasal drip has turned into a cold/sinus infection. Just couldn't muster the energy or time, even for yoga.

<u>Saturday - <s>5k Race</s></u>
Skipped out on the Greenville News 5k Run Downtown due to continuing cold/congestion issues. I hated to miss it but figured it was the ""responsible"" thing to do. Boooo adulting. :(

<u>Sunday - rest</u>
More rest for the <s>weary</s> sick."

<u>Tuesday - 3mi run</u>
Cold run today! Felt pretty darn good though, and pace showed it - 9:20/mi for the 3.2 miles.

<u>Wednesday - cross-train</u>
Bike ride with Megan today - COLD! I almost had us turn around as soon as we started, but stuck it out and was glad we did. Averaged 13.7 mph for the 14.3 miles. Ended up feeling pretty nice by the end of the ride!

<u>Thursday - speedwork: 30 min tempo</u>
This was only my second time doing a tempo run outdoors (i.e. not on a treadmill were I can easily gauge/control speed). The idea of a tempo run is to warm up, gradually increase pace over a period of time, peak at ~10k pace for 1-2 minutes, then cooldown. It's simple enough to do on a treadmill, but pretty challenging to do outdoors - hence the reason it's known as the ""thinking runner's workout"". I only had time to do 2 full tempo intervals plus the short ""peak"". Here's how my splits (mileage / pace) turned out:

Warmup: 1.06mi / 9:47
Intervals:
0.62mi / 8:50
0.63mi / 8:19
Peak: 0.27mi / 7:18 
Cooldown: 0.49mi / 8:36

Except for my cooldown and peak being a bit too fast (I don't think I can run a 10k at that pace right now), I'm pretty pleased with how my ""run by feel"" went! I declare this run a success. :D

<u>Friday - yoga</u>
Yogahhhhh Friday! :) 

<u>Saturday - 3mi pace</u>
Since I'm not yet sure what my race pace is, this was a challenging run to set out on. I've tentatively targeted 8:25-8:30 as my goal pace (~1:50 goal time) but considering I haven't even run a 5k that fast since D was born, I have no idea if that's reasonable. I had an 8:45 target pace in my head for this run when I started, but I decided I was not going to look at my watch during the run. I ran what I felt was a strong but sustainable pace and figured I'd see where that ended up.

Well.
<img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/littlechemist/3129645/101515/101515_original.jpg"" alt="""" title="""">
WHUT.

Mile splits were 7:32, 8:18, 8:11. I guess my speed is back more than I thought?! Maybe a sub-8 pace for next Saturday's 5k isn't unreasonable, except for the fact that I'll probably be pushing D in the stroller, so PRs aren't really an option. Womp womp. But anyway, at least I know it would have been possible!

<u>Sunday - <s>6mi run</s> rest</u>
Well an awesome week of course had to be rounded out by random sickness that prevented me from doing my long run. DANG. I was doing so well, too! Unfortunately, I woke up in the middle of the night, and again at 6:30am, puking my guts out. UGH. Spent all day on the couch and ate nothing but saltine crackers. Hoping this is just a 24-hr bug and I can get back to training next week!"

"event","I'm officially ""in training"" for the half! Ahh I love the start of a new training plan (y'know, before things go haywire and everything gets screwed up lol). With the rain in the forecast it's going to be a challenge for the first week at least, but oh well. Here we go!

I'm following Hal Higdon's <a href=""http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51132/Half-Marathon-Intermediate-Training-Program"">Intermediate Half Marathon training plan. </a> It's the plan I followed for my 1:44:10 <a href=""http://littlechemist.livejournal.com/494307.html"">PR in Savannah</a> in Nov. 2013. I'm not planning on a PR here, but hoping to get back some speed post-pregnancy. I haven't fully decided on a time goal, but I'm toying with the idea of 1:50-ish. I may adjust during training.

In general, I plan to stick with the schedule as closely as possible. The Thursday short run + strength will likely be traded out for a mid-week bike ride most of the time. I'll also mix up the Tue/Wed/Thur workouts as my schedule necessitates at work. The short weekend run may also be occasionally replaced by a bike ride. Cross-training, yo. Friday rest day will be yoga as often as possible.

Each week, I'll post the plan as-written, and then my actual workouts below it.

<u>Tuesday - 3mi run</u>
Dargan took a long post-surgery nap this afternoon, so I was able to get in my prescribed 3 miler around the neighborhood. Nothing too exciting, though the weather was gorgeous. Average pace was 9:22/mi - first mile was a sub-9 pace, but I petered out after that. Pretty good!

<u>Wednesday - <s>run</s> rest day</u>
Rain all day = moved this week's rest day to today.

<u>Thursday - <s>crosstrain</s> speedwork: 5x400</u>
Wanted to make sure I got my speedwork in this week, so instead of an easy run/cross-training, I did my intervals today. I usually do speedwork on a treadmill, but we don't have one and the gym at work is being renovated, so I mapped out a route in the neighborhood that would take me to a stretch where I could do some flat-ish quarter mile repeates. Started with a ~1 mile warm-up run, then alternated quarter mile intervals of speed & rest. Speed intervals are supposed to be ""5k pace"" but I'm not sure what my current 5k pace is... so I just went by feel and ran ""fast"". Rest intervals were about 60s of walking followed by easy jogging.

Speed splits: 6:50, 7:14, 7:34, 7:01, 6:35

That last one is a bit of a fluke... it was completely on a pretty decent downhill. But still... I'm really pleased to see 6's and 7's there! I'll really be interested in how I do at the Greenville News 5k in a couple of weeks. I don't feel fast at all, so a race setting will be a good test.

<u>Friday - <s>rest</s> cross-train</u>
Since I had my weekly rest day on Wednesday this week, I decided to do my cross-training bike ride today. Got out late in the afternoon but managed to beat sunset and get in the entire route I'd planned. I did the normal Tigerville cow farm loop, but backwards. I wasn't sure how I'd feel towards the end climbing up the hills on Little Texas Rd, but it turned out to be not as bad as I'd recalled from the last time I did it! Total of just under 27 miles, average 14.2 mph moving speed.

<u>Saturday - 3mi run</u>
Finally some nice winter running weather! Beautiful sunshine and 40s this morning for an easy 3 around the neighborhood. Average 9:42 pace.

<b>Bonus!</b>
Took Dargan in the bike trailer this afternoon down the Swamp Rabbit to Upstate Craft Beer Co. with Robin & Dale. Total of a bit shy of 20 miles. Beautifully sunny and chilly afternoon!

<u>Sunday - 5mi run</u>
Love cold weather running! I could tell my legs were tired from many days in a row of running and or biking, so I took it slow and easy, just aimed to keep a consistent pace. Did some hills in the neighborhood and ended up with an average 10:15 pace. After a few more weeks I hope to figure out what my target training paces should be for each workout. I'll see where I'm at and reevaluate after the Gvl News 5k most likely."

"event","So, last week (Nov. 2-8) was a recovery week from the Spinx Half. Since then, I've done ZERO exercise. There will be no blog for week of Nov. 9-13. Work has been nuts, I've been all over the place (mentally, emotionally), Dargan hadn't been sleeping, but things are settling down and I should be able to get back to it this weekend. 

Here's from Nov. 2-8:

<b><u>Monday - rest</u></b>
Originally thought I might do some light stretching and weights, but opted for full rest day. 

<b><u>Tuesday - lift</u></b>
Did a quick lifting session today. Started with a 1/2 mile treadmill walk with a slight incline to warm up the legs - still have some residual soreness from Saturday's half. 

Next was 3x8:
-----
Curls 2x15#
OHP 2x15#
Squat 1x20#
-----
Chest press 2x15#
Skull crushers 1x15#
Lunges 1x15#
-----
One-arm row 1x20#
OH tri press 1x20#
Goblet squat 1x20# **

**Only did 2 sets of goblet squats - quads started to cramp on the third set, so I called it off. Finished with some leg stretches and a bit of ab work. Not bad, but really feeling ""meh"" the whole time. I think lack of sleep is just weighing everything down right now.

<b><u>Wednesday - bike</u></b>
Originally planned an actual bike ride with the gals, but weather and stuff got in the way, so I did a stationary bike ride instead. Got in 11 miles in 45 mins on a ""random"" setting. Still shaking out some residual soreness from the half marathon. Hopefully ok for a run tomorrow!

<b><u>Thursday - <s>run</s></u></b>
Still had boatloads of leg soreness, so between that and having a bunch of stuff to do at work (what else is new) I opted for a rest day. Looking forward to (hopefully) making it to yoga tomorrow.

<b><u>Friday - yoga</u></b>
YAY finally made it to Friday yoga class. 

<b><u>Saturday - rest</u></b>
Rainy day = rest day.

<b><u>Sunday - run</u></b>
Went for a run in the neighborhood with Dargan in the stroller. This was the longest run I've done while pushing the stroller, and man it was TOUGH. Our neighborhood is hilly, so definitely was a challenge, but it felt so nice. The weather was a bit cool and cloudy, and the trees are showing their gorgeous colors - such a great fall day for a run. We got just over 6 miles in!

"event","Finally have the mental capacity to sit down and write... it's been a long weekend/week so far!

I would post a weekly race week summary, but I didn't do ANY exercise in the week leading up to the race... soooo there's that. Between poor sleep with the baby and crazy work schedules, I just didn't have the energy and figured I'd save it all for race day. 

Scott and I did get to have a fun ""just the two of us"" adventure on Friday before the race - we went ziplining! Neither of us had ever been before, but we won a pair of tickets at a charity auction recently, so we took the day off from work, had the grandparents watch little D, and we went Friday morning. It was so much fun, and beautiful because Saluda, NC is in peak leaf season...

On Saturday, we left the house around 7am (race start at 7:50), parked downtown, and walked over to Fluor Field for the start. Got there in plenty of time and got to see the sunrise. :)

<i>At the start line - clearly excited</i>

We started off and at first tried to stay together... but between Scott getting frustrated at the crowds and me wanting to pace myself, we separated after about 1 mile. I felt OK until around mile 5 or 6 when I started getting tired. Nothing really hurt, I just kind of had the ""ugh is it over yet"" feeling. By mile 6, I'd been passed by everyone else I knew who was running the race, and at mile 8ish my feet were hurting pretty bad. Then somewhere around mile 9 or 10 I must have gotten a second wind, because suddenly I felt GREAT, felt my pace increase (though my mile splits don't show a huge difference), and things just felt better. Maybe it was the Mile 9 water stop? Who knows. Oddly it was just after a big uphill section, so maybe it was the rush of pushing the heartrate a little higher. Whatever it was, I was thankful for it. I felt great the rest of the race even though my feet still hurt a bit. At mile 11 I happened to glance at my watch (which I never do) and saw that I was around 1:40 time... I knew if I could maintain sub-10 pace I would be able to get under 2 hour finish time... my stretch goal! As I entered the outfield of the baseball stadium (this race ends with running the bases and finishes on home plate), I looked at my Garmin again and saw 1:58:30... exclaimed ""SHIT!"" and took off sprinting... crossed the finish line as the clock said 1:59:40 - YESSSS!!!!!!!!!

Official finish (chip) time was 1:59:12. SO EXCITED.

I found Scott (who had finished in 1:41... WHOA) and we made our way back to the car and back home.

"event","<u><b>Monday - lift</b></u>
Pretty good lift today but had to cut short due to time constraints. I want to start tracking weights/reps for things more closely to see if I can make any improvements (not likely unless I start lifting more than once per week). 

3x8 for all, super-setted with 10x pushups (all done ""real"" aka not on my knees!)

Curls - 1x 15#
OH tri - 1x 20#
Squat - 1x 20#
{10x pushups}
OHP - 2x 15#
Chest press - 2x 15#

Goblet squat - 1x 20#
{10x pushups}
Fwd arm raise - 1x 15#
Hammer curl - 2x 15#
Deadlift - 2x 20#

Pretty excited that I didn't have to drop down in any weights on any of the sets! Finished with mason twists with the medicine ball because I didn't have time to do Ab Ripper. 

<u><b>Tuesday - <s>run</s></b></u>
It's sad but I had to go look at my Garmin stats to see if I did any exercise this day. 
Answer = newp.

<u><b>Wednesday - bike</b></u>
Short ride with Megan around Upstate with the extra hill = 10.5 miles.

<u><b>Thursday - run</b></u>
Good lunch run today, felt speedy - it was pretty good! Average 9:26 pace for a little over 4 miles.

<u><b>Friday - <s>lift</s></b></u>
Rest day because of colleague's baby shower preparations. Fun! :)

<u><b>Saturday - run</b></u>
Final training long run for Spinx! Scott, Dargan, and I ran from downtown back to the house. Total 8.7 miles at 9:21 average moving pace - truckin' for real!

"event","Ah it feels good to complete a full week of training with minimal hiccups and complications! I finally registered us for the race, so it's official - 10/31 is 13.1 day. Plus we got our longest training run done this weekend, so now it's taper time! :)

<u><b>Monday - <s>lift</s></b></u>
Blerp. Busy Monday back from vacation. 

<u><b>Tuesday - bike</b></u>
Supposed to help lead the group bike ride today at work for our Health Fair, but nobody showed up! So Megan, Vim, and I had a nice short ride through Upstate together. Just a total of 7.5 miles.

<u><b>Wednesday - Vita Course Challenge practice</b></u>
Our team runs the Vita Course Challenge on Friday morning, so we practiced together as (most of) a team. Not bad! After we finished the course, Lauren C. and I ran an extra ~1.5 miles together to get a total of a 5k. 

<u><b>Thursday - run</b></u>
Told myself this would be an easy run due to the Vita Challenge the following day, but felt good with the cooler weather so ended up stretching out the distance a bit. Got in 4 miles at a bit over a 10-minute pace. Woot!

<u><b>Friday - Vita Course Challenge</b></u>
This is an annual event at work where teams of 4-6 people run the ~1.3-mile Vita Course - a loop with 10 different exercise stations like pushups, pullups, squat jacks, situps, bicep curls, parallel bar walks, etc. The team has to run the loop, stopping at each station with 4 of the team members doing a set number of reps before moving on to the next. There are competitive and recreational divisions, and there's always a big competition between the different businesses at the company. This year they made a female division, and our team (the Fit Chicks) ended up winning! We did the course in just under 13 minutes.

<u><b>Saturday - run</b></u>
Chilly (40s) in the morning when we headed out to run at about 8:30. We left a car downtown at Barley's the night before, so the plan was to run from the house to downtown - hooray planning ahead so we didn't have to do an out-and-back run! We met up with Dale at about the halfway point and ran the Swamp Rabbit into downtown. Scott and I had to do some zig-zagging through downtown to finish out our needed mileage (11 miles!) and ended at the farmer's market to get some post-run snacks and coffee. Dargan did AMAZING, was awake and happy for the first part of the run (he loves looking at trees) and then napped for the last half.

Snuggled in his stroller with a warm blanket and hat!

We got in 11.1 miles with an average moving pace of 9:30/mi - fastest long run yet!! Maybe my stretch goal of ""as close to 2 hours as possible"" for the half isn't so far off...  :D

<u><b>Sunday - bike</b></u>
While hanging out at Barley's on Friday night, we got to discussing weekend bike ride plans with Dale and decided Sunday morning would be a good time for some mountain biking! Scott wanted to get in a long ride at DuPont in the afternoon, so Dale picked me and my bike up at 8:30 and we headed up to Pleasant Ridge. We did 2 loops - I did the full loop the first time around and took Sassy's Pass (easier shortcut that takes off ~0.5 mi) the second loop. I was proud of myself for taking the long loop but I'm glad I did it - it wasn't as hard as I remembered! I was slightly faster the first loop (6.6mph vs 6.5mph) but felt great for the whole ride - total 9.2 miles."

"event","Well talk about a schedule upset... Week 9 was all sickness. I was congested and sniffly, stayed home sick from work on Wednesday and didn't work out at all. I was afraid of getting worse before my chorus competition the first week of October.

Finally felt better by Sunday (10/4) so Scott and I did a 10 mile run. It was great!

Then we headed to Las Vegas for the competition... no exercise really, but a LOT of walking. We did go on a mountain bike ride Tuesday morning, and hiked Wednesday & Friday. We also did a 5k on Saturday morning, where Scott won first place overall and I got 2nd place Female 30-39! To be fair, there were only about 30 participants in the entire race, but still... it was a fun morning for a family race!

"event","<u><b>Monday - lift</b></u>
Good lift today, left out the cardio circuit due to a pretty big caloric deficit remaining from over the weekend. It's hard to make up calories from a 30-mile ride! 

<u><b>Tuesday - run</b></u>
Decent run, felt OK on pace. Cooler weather makes a huge difference! 3.4 miles at 9:23 pace.

<u><b>Wednesday - bike</b></u>
Got in a short (10.5mi) ride in with Anneliese at average 14.7 mph. Had to make it a quick one due to a last-minute lunch meeting that I got pulled into. 

<u><b>Thursday - run</b></u>
Ah, perfect weather today and great run! I was worried because I got a late start so I was hungry, but I decided to push the distance and got 4.3 miles in at 9:43 pace! Even took the hilly route out to USC Upstate and back. Feeling great about this run. :)

<u><b>Friday - yoga</b></u>
Fiiiinally made it to yoga class at lunch today! Felt nice to be all stretchy. 

<u><b>Saturday - <s>run</s></b></u>
We got up to run early before I had to go to chorus coaching, but it was rainy alllll day. Boo! I guess it was time for a ""drop-back"" week, but hadn't planned on dropping back to zero! Oh well, go with the flow. 

<u><b>Sunday - mountain bike</b></u>
Had a GREAT ride with Scott at DuPont forest! We went with Robin & Dale and they were kind enough to watch Dargan while Scott and I did a 8.5 mile loop together. Scott was practically giddy with excitement of being able to mountain bike together again at DuPont. It's been a LONG time! We ended the day with a trip to Oskar Blues Brewery."

"event","<u><b>Monday -run</b></u>
Only had time for a short run today. Did 2.6 miles at 9:30ish pace. I felt really tired, probably due to Dargan's frequent wake-ups last night (he's still getting over his illness). Hoping he gets back to full health soon because momma needs sleep!!

<u><b>Tuesday - lift</b></u>
Workout in the afternoon, started out with some strength training:
	- curls, OHP, deadlift
	- chest press, OH lat, one leg glute bridge
	- OH tri, fwd arm raise, side lunge
Then did the P90X Ab Ripper workout. 
Finished with treadmill intervals: 5 min warmup, 1/3/1/2/2 minutes of alternating speed (7.5mph)/rest(6.5mph) for a total of 1.5 miles.

<u><b>Wednesday - bike</b></u>
Almost had to skip out but was determined to get out because it was SO nice outside. Got caught up in a convo at my desk so I missed the group riding, but went out on my own for a short 11.5 mile loop. Felt good though legs were a little sore from the side lunges yesterday (of course). Averaged 15.4 mph!

<u><b>Thursday - run</b></u>
Pretty good run today! Hoped to get out in the morning while it was nice and cool (under 80!) but wasn't able to. Got out right at lunch time and had a nice 4-mile run. 9:30 pace, not too bad. Glad to get in some good distance today!

<u><b>Friday - <s>yoga</s></b></u>
Once again, meetings and scheduling prevented yoga. Boo!

<u><b>Saturday - trail run</b></u>
Went to Paris Mountain with Megan, Robin, Dale, and Anneliese for a trail run. We parked at the top lot and ran the loop of Sulphur Springs > Firetower > Kanuga > North Lake > Pipsissewa > Brissy Ridge. I had forgotten how tough the last section of that loop was! Felt great to get out there though, and fun to run with friends. Total of 4.8 miles with 700 feet of elevation gain. 

<u><b>Sunday - bike</b></u>
Got to hop on the bike Sunday afternoon and decided to do a ""real"" (i.e. non-Swamp Rabbit) ride. I haven't done much solo road riding, but decided to try it. Headed out on the loop towards Tigerville to the cow farm and had a great ride! Averaged 14.7 mph with 1,500ft climbing on the ~27 mile ride."

"event","<u><b>Monday - lift</b></u>
You know you're single-parenting for the first part of the week when you finally convince yourself to work out only because you need a shower and can't get one at home. 
Yup.
I was glad I ended up getting down there though, even if it was a short workout. Did 3200m on the rowing machine followed by various core work. Finished out with a few sets of squats/deadlifts while listening to ""Drop It Low"" on the iPod, a routine I call the ""anti-mom butt"" workout.

<u><b>Tuesday - run</b></u>
Got outside to run today and looking at the weather before I went, it said 77F - ""Nice!"" I thought. NOPE. Super humid and not a breath of air moving. Yuck. Still it was cloudy and the temperatures weren't awful so it wasn't too bad. I felt good on the run, wished I had time for more but just ran for time - switched my Garmin over to just the clock and told myself I just needed to be back by 12:30. Ended up running 3.8 miles at a 9:41 average pace. Pretty happy with that time & distance! I'm really shocked how well my speed is coming back with minimal work. Hopefully it isn't too much of a struggle to get back to where I was pre-baby.

<u><b>Wednesday - bike</b></u>
Wasn't sure the weather would hold out for us based on the storms that rolled through last night, but turned out to be a nice (though humid) morning for a ride! Got out around 9:15 this morning with a couple of work peeps and we did 14.3 miles at an average 15.6mph - really excited about that speed! I still don't feel like I'm back to where I was in the speed department, but anything over 15mph at this point is pretty awesome for me. Yay!

<u><b>Thursday - run + lift</b></u>
I went out for a run but got hungry so cut it short. Still got in a little over 2 miles at a 9:25 pace. Felt like doing a bit of strength when I got back in, so I did a bit of upper body and called it a day.

<u><b>Friday - <s>yoga</s></b></u>
Dargan came down with a fever Thursday night so we had to keep him home from daycare. No yoga Friday today!

<u><b>Saturday - run & Swamp Rabbit Brewery 5k</b></u>
My roughly-planned half marathon training schedule had us doing 5-6 miles today, but we also had the Beer & BBQ 5k at Swamp Rabbit in the evening. I wasn't overly concerned about ""racing"" this one, so we got there early and did a couple of miles on the trail before the race. Turned out to be a good warm-up! I felt super tired on our pre-race run (10+ avg pace) but managed sub-9 pace during the race. Not too bad!

"event","First week back at work after maternity leave and trying to get on a good workout schedule. It's challenging because I'm pumping milk 3x per day, and working that around meetings plus getting in a workout is really hard! Doing my best though and working really hard to maintain milk supply for Dargan while he's at daycare.

<u><b>Monday - lift</b></u>
Finally got downstairs at 3 after a meeting and was really tired by this point. With Dargan not sleeping well it's difficult to have the energy for a solid workout. Still, I gave it an effort and did some strength/cardio circuits for 30 mins. 

<i>Note: It's Tuesday morning and my abs are sore. Win!</i>

<u><b>Tuesday - run & mountain bike</b></u>
Short run at lunch today (2.5 miles) at mid-morning to beat the heat. Actually had sub-10 minute miles! Pretty happy with this run and looking forward to a fun bike ride tonight.

The bike ride started out with me getting stung by a yellow jacket in my calf (OUCH!). Thankfully I'm not allergic so it was just dealing with the pain & slight swelling. I took off on the loop and was really struggling climbing but powered through and ended up really enjoying the ride. Felt great by the end and finished the loop in 40 minutes.

<u><b>Wednesday - run</b></u>
Ran on the treadmill today due to an air quality advisory (plus it's dang hot). Felt pretty darn good and was able to come close to a 30-minute 5k (30:30) so I'm hopeful that I can get a sub-30 at the upcoming Michelin 5k two weekends from now. Shocking how tough a 9-minute pace feels right now!

<u><b>Thursday - bike</b></u>
Met with the girls for a mid-morning bike ride on the 14-mile loop at work. It was challenging but felt good to be back out on the bike! I think it's going to take a while to get my speed back up, but at least I can hang and get in the miles.

<u><b>Friday - yoga</b></u>
Excited to add yoga Fridays back to my routine. :)

<u><b>Saturday - run</b></u>
Dargan's sleep (or lack thereof) allowed us to meet up with Dale & Robin at Trailblazer park in TR for the morning run. It was shockingly cool and low humidity which felt great! We trekked north on the Swamp Rabbit to a point and turned around, got a total of 5 miles! Averaged 10:45 pace... pretty happy with the fact that my pace is slowly coming down while still building mileage. 

<u><b>Sunday - bike</b></u>
Met up with Dale & Robin at Donaldson Center to ride the Perimeter loop. We did 3 loops (7 miles each) and averaged 15 mph. It was hot but enough clouds and breeze that the ride wasn't too bad. I think this would be a good place to do some speed work in the future!"

"event","Because I'm craving some sort of normalcy outside of being a new mom, I've started to take a look at my long term race calendar and set some goals. Here's what I've come up with:

October 2015 - Spinx Half

Spring 2016 - Clemson tri (May), half marathon (TBD, possibly Shamrock Half in VA Beach in March)
Fall 2016 - half IM (September - Augusta 70.3 ?)

Winter/early spring 2017 - full marathon (TBD)
May 2017 - Clemson tri
Fall 2017 - full IM (late September - IM Chattanooga?)

I feel like this is reasonable yet exciting, and one race builds into the next. Obviously this is kind of an ideal, pie-in-the-sky scenario... but who knows, maybe now that I've written it down it will happen!

Been trying to figure out which full marathon to do. I've briefly looked and there's one in West Palm Beach (easy because the in-laws live there) in early December, and there's the Mercedes Marathon in Alabama in mid-February. I really loved the timing of the Hilton Head marathon but I don't want to do that one again. I'd do the half, but there was way too much running on highway shoulders for my taste. Was a great race, but don't think I'd do it again.

So many things to plan & think about!! For right now, I'm excited to jump into HALF MARATHON TRAINING!! :D  I like to do a 12-week prep time for a half, plus the fact that Scott will be joining me (!!!!) means that we kick off with a 4-mile run this weekend as our first ""long run"". SO EXCITED!

I ran 3 miles without walking yesterday morning for the first time since pregnancy, which was exciting. I think by training with the stroller for my mid-week runs it should make the weekend runs (where Scott has volunteered to push the stroller) that much easier. We shall see!"

"event","On Friday evening, Scott, Dargan, and I participated in the Thomas Creek Beer BBQ 5k. This was the second of three in a series of 5k fun runs sponsored by local breweries. The final one is at Swamp Rabbit in August. 

My goal was only to run as much of the race as possible. So far I haven't run more than 1.5 miles consecutively, so I knew running 3.1 miles would be a stretch. As hot as it was (near 100F) I wasn't surprised when I needed several walking breaks, though I did make it to the water stop at the halfway point without walking. Woohoo! 

We finished the race in just under 35 minutes... 10 minutes faster than the last one! Pretty happy with that, and maybe a 30 minute 5k is doable by the next race. Here's hoping!

"event","<b>Humbling.</b>

That 7:30/mi pace you had previously? Those miles you could tick off with no problem? That hill you could crest with barely a second thought? Yeah, not anymore. It's like starting over completely, only this time you're so acutely aware of how far you've fallen. Your body has been through some serious hell and it's going to remind you of that every time you get out there. Getting the ""marathon legs"" feeling from 2 miles at an 11:30 pace? Welcome to your new normal.

<b>Inconsistent.</b>

Training plan? Scheduled runs? Forget about it. No matter how much planning you do, it all revolves around the Tiny Dictator who runs your life. Yes, you can probably get out there at some point today... if he's nice! But who knows how long it'll last. Can't plan a route, can't stick to a training plan... it's a lesson in ""take things as they come"" for sure.

<b>Fartlek.</b>

No, this isn't a reference to some terrible new gastrointestinal phenomenon... it's how you tell yourself ""OK... just run to that next mailbox, then take a walk break if you need it."" And usually, you need it. Just get to the next driveway, the next block, the next shadow across the road. And walk if you need it. Hint: you'll need it.

<b>Empowering.</b>

Because despite all of this ^^, you're out there doing it. And you've got your Tiny Human with you! A new generation of runners to inspire.

<i>Hello, world!</i>

Today marks 6 weeks post partum, which is tentatively the time I can start exercising again. I go for a checkup on Tuesday to get the official OK from my midwife, but I feel good and have started doing a little bit on my own this week (shhh, don't tell!).

Dargan and I have taken walks around the neighborhood each morning (Monday thru Thursday) of this past week, with distances varying from 1.5 - 3.5 miles. Given the hills in our area, it's been challenging, but I felt good being able to get out and about! We also did our first 5k race yesterday. 

It was the R.J. Rockers Beer BBQ 5K - first of 3 in a series of brewery-sponsored 5k events. Each participant gets a complimentary BBQ sandwich and beer after the race! Scott picked up our numbers (and commemorative beach towel - each race has a different commemorative item) on Friday so we wouldn't have to worry about it on race day. The race started at 6:30pm on Saturday, so of course being mid-June it was guaranteed to be HOT HOT HOT. Thankfully it rained earlier in the afternoon, so the temperatures were slightly lower than predicted, and there was a nice breeze which kept the humidity from being unbearable.

We lined up at the start in the very back with Dargan in the stroller, and soon we were off!

It became immediately obvious that we were very possibly going to be the absolute last people to finish the race... the bulk of the participants were out of sight before the first turn. This was a new experience for me! I was slightly panicked! However, we gradually caught up with other walkers & some slower runners, so I felt better that we weren't going to be dead last. 

We did experience some aggressive drivers on one part of the course (they didn't seem to understand the concept of an event going on and that they needed to change lanes to go around), but other than that, the volunteers and officers were really great and most drivers were patient. I couldn't believe it though... the worst one was an elderly couple who kept honking and revving towards us... and we very clearly had a baby in a stroller! What is wrong with people!!?! I sent an email to the race organizer this morning to alert them of this incident.

On a few of the downhill/shady sections of the course, I couldn't help myself and did a little bit of jogging - eeeek I can't wait to run again for real! I'm not supposed to be running yet, so I took it very very easy. Still, I could feel the endorphins start kicking in as soon as my pace quickened. :D

All this week, the couple of times I've done 3 miles, it took well over an hour. As the miles ticked by yesterday, though, with the bits of jogging we'd done it became evident that we could possibly finish in under 45 minutes... challenge accepted! We jogged the last quarter mile and crossed the finish line just before the clock ticked over to 45:00 (official race time says 44:55)!

After the race, we got our BBQ and beer and hung out at the brewery listening to the band for a while before heading home. Hooray, Dargan's first race as an outside baby! :)"

"event","So despite the heroic effort and completion of the half marathon just 2 weeks ago, I have found it increasingly difficult over the past weeks to continue running with any sort of effectiveness or level of comfort/satisfaction. I've decided that it is time to hang up the running shoes until after baby arrives. 

I probably would have given it up sooner had it not been for hard-headed stubbornness and drive to finish the half, but with that out of the way, it is just difficult to justify putting myself through the discomfort. Plus, I like to think I have enough running experience to be able to differentiate between good kinds of difficulty/discomfort and not-so-good kinds. I just don't think it's a good idea to keep going right now.

So, I've started walking more, done some elliptical, felt pretty good on the bike yesterday, keeping up with my squats and strength training... just have to stop the running. Ugh. And just as the spring weather is starting to arrive! I struggled (mentally) today on my walk, just wrestling with the concept of not being able to run. I'm sure I'll come to terms with it at some point, but it's difficult right now."

Such a great race today, despite the cold weather - really turned out to be a beautiful day for running!

"event","Well then... I made that big <a href=""http://littlechemist.livejournal.com/523750.html"" target=""_blank"">announcement a month ago</a> and then left things hanging! My bad, y'all...

I won't go re-hash all of the workouts from the past month, but I'll summarize and hit the highlights. I've been focusing more attention on the <a href=""http://babytrenor.blogspot.com/"" target=""_blank"">Baby Blog</a> recently.

- Spent the first week of February in Daytona Beach for a work education seminar. Got some runs on the beach in, some walks, and hit the hotel gym for a session on the stationary bike one day.

- Long runs on Saturday Feb. 7th (10mi) & 14th (9.5mi)

- Bike rides on Sunday Feb. 8th (24mi) & 15th (15mi)

- Had a nice <a href=""http://babytrenor.blogspot.com/2015/02/24-weeks-happy-valentines-day.html"" target=""_blank"">Valentine's Weekend</a> 

A few snow days over the past two weeks have really thrown things off as far as regular exercise. Between that and <a href=""http://babytrenor.blogspot.com/2015/02/25-weeks-trip-to-houston.html"" target=""_blank"">traveling to Houston</a> last weekend, it's been really tough to get in my usual 5-6 days per week of exercise! Scott and I did get to do a 5k race while we were in Houston, so that marks Texas off the list of 50 Races in 50 States!

Now I'm just looking forward to the GHS Swamp Rabbit half marathon on Saturday! Hoping I don't freeze my butt off since it's supposed to be in the 20s (with windchill down to 10 degrees F!)."

"event","<u><b>Monday - run</b></u>
4 miles at lunch, nothing overly exciting about it. Pretty standard run!

<u><b>Tuesday - bike</b></u>
Great day for a ride with Megan & Vim! Thought it was going to be cold, but turned out to be a beautiful day. Total of 10.5 miles.

<u><b>Wednesday - run</b></u>
Another 4-miler at lunch, a bit faster than Monday's run but not significantly. Cold wind blowing (15-20mph) and the temperatures are dropping rapidly. Gonna be a cold one tonight!

<u><b>Thursday - lift/row</b></u>
Given that temperatures weren't forecasted to get out of the 20s (mayyybe into the 30s) I opted for an indoor workout.
Lap 1: 3x10 lifting
Overhead press
Squat
Row
-----
Curl
Deadlift
OH tri press
-----
Chest fly
Lunges
OH lat pull
-----
Hammer curl
Side leg raise
Chest press

Lap 2: 50 floors on the stair climber
Lap 3: 2500m rowing

And now I'm HUNGRY!!!

<u><b>Friday - <s>yoga</s> rest</b></u>
Decided it was time for a full rest day, so I took one!

<u><b>Saturday - bike</b></u>
Got the crew out for a COLD bike ride on the Swamp Rabbit. Started at my house, pedaled over to the SRT and down to the creepy kids park. Stopped for a selfie:
<img src=""https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10933818_10101537929888203_8832677336148738657_n.jpg?oh=534e426d8cfae4f08dd1994b1bae34a9&oe=5522AF55"" width=""600"" />
...then headed back north and ended with lunch at Upcountry Provisions in TR. We were FROZEN by then and thankful for a delicious meal. Total of 22 miles biked!

<u><b>Sunday - run</b></u>
The clouds set in early and made getting out the door difficult. Eventually I headed out around 2:30 and covered about 5.3 hilly miles in total. Not as long of a run as I'd originally planned, so I took Shiner out for a quick neighborhood walk after I got home and felt better about that. He always gets sad and stressed when Scott goes out of town, so hopefully it helped."

"event","Ok, I've FINALLY picked my next race (more about that in next week's post) so this has been the last week of off-season training. I think a solid 10 weeks of non-specific training has done me good both mentally and physically. 

<b><u>Monday - lift</u></b>
3x8 for everything:

Chest fly
One-leg glute bridge raise
Overhead lat pull
Crunches
-----
Curls
Squats
Rows
Mason twist
-----
Overhead press
Deadlift
Overhead tri
Toe-touches
-----
Chest press
Side-step with resistance band
Hammer curls
Pushups

Finished with 2000m on the rowing machine (ohhhh how my back & shoulders are going to hurt tomorrow, I can just tell!)

<b><u>Tuesday - long run</u></b>
I had a random half-day of vacation to use up, so I took the afternoon off from work and got the last of my Christmas shopping done. Since I'd slept through my long run on Sunday, I figured it would be a good afternoon to get some miles in, too! I headed out around 3pm and trucked out towards Furman. Ran all over the campus and then headed north on the Swamp Rabbit Trail towards TR. Hit my turn-around mileage before I got into the town, so headed home. It was a slow slow run, but I'm happy that I got in a bit over 11 miles!! YES! :D Longest run in a LONG time, and felt pretty darn good. Could certainly tell the legs were tired for the rest of the evening, but it felt great to get that distance.

<b><u>Wednesday - off</u></b>
Appointments, working from home, and too many meetings once I did make it to work = rest day. It was ok though because I knew ahead of time, so I'd planned the day off. I think my legs need it after yesterday anyway!

<b><u>Thursday - bike</u></b>
Nice short ride with Megan & Robin today around Upstate. I had to ride quickly to get back for a meeting so I only got to do 7.5 miles, but it was nice to get out in the sunshine regardless!

<b><u>Friday - run</u></b>
Ran at lunch with Scott today - it was a nice day out! Total of 4 miles around the campus.

<b><u>Saturday - off</u></b>
Rainy, yucky day - rest day!

<b><u>Sunday - bike</u></b>
Got out on the road bike with Scott for another 30-miler! I felt cruddy early on, but after we cut out a few hilly parts I was able to push to the full distance that we were aiming for. Was chilly towards the end of the day but really happy with this ride!"

"event","Another good week of off-season training, though I'm still a little disappointed in myself that I didn't get my long run in this weekend. No one to blame but myself, but I do think it's important to listen to your body and if it says ""LET ME REST!"" then do it!

<b><u>Monday - lift</u></b>
3x10 for everything:

OH press
Sumo squat
One-arm renegade row
Crunches on stability ball
-----
Curls
Deadlift
Pushups
Side-bend w/ weights
-----
Arnold press
Side-step w/ band
OH tri press
Mason twists
-----
Rows
Squats
Shoulder side-raise
Toe-touch w/ medicine ball

<b><u>Tuesday - bike</u></b>
Had a nice bike ride with Scott and Vim today. We did the loop through Upstate, then Vim had to leave so Scott and I did the short extra out-and-back loop up the hill. I was afraid it would be cold, but turned out to be a really lovely day for a ride! Total of 10.5 miles.

<b><u>Wednesday - run</u></b>
Ran with Megan and Robin today on the Earth Run cross-country course. It was chilly and a bit windy, but at least the sun was out. Was nice to run with other people for a change! Total of 3.2 miles.

<b><u>Thursday - bike</u></b>
Biked with Megan and Vim today on the short loop through Upstate with the extra out-and-back on the hill (or ""Mount Everest"" as Vim calls it). We had a nice ride and once again it was not as cold as I'd anticipated, though definitely colder than Tuesday! Total 10.5 miles.

<b><u>Friday - yoga</u></b>
Good yoga class today, nice hammie stretches and some down dogs. Always a nice way to end the week. Had to skip the ""plow"" in the middle, but thankfully didn't get called out by the instructor during class. :)

<b><u>Saturday - bike</u></b>
Longest bike ride since the White Squirrel Metric in October! Really happy with how it went. It was slow but pleased with getting 32 miles in. Scott and I rode out to Tigerville and back - was comfortable enough to wear short sleeves and shorts! 

<b><u>Sunday - <s>run</s> rest</u></b>
I had every intention of going on a long run, but after running errands all morning I just didn't have it in me. Crashed on the couch for a 2 hour nap instead. Sometimes you just have to go with what your body says it needs!"

"event","Not a bad week, although ended a little rough with the crazy cold rain on Sunday! Here's how it all went...

<b><u>Monday - lift</b></u>
Good strength session today, used all resistance bands instead of weights just to switch things up a bit. 3x10 for all.

Curls
OH press
Side-step
------
OH tri press
Chest fly
Fwd & reverse leg lift
------
""Offering"" pilates move (w/ resistance band)
High row
Deadlift
------
Low row
Tri press back
Squat
------
Core work (3x10): overhead lat pull sit-up, mason twists, toe touch - all w/ 8lb medicine ball

<b><u>Tuesday - bike</u></b>
Original plan was to ride a ""long"" route with Megan at lunch, but the friggin' cold weather, lack of sunshine, and wind combined to make conditions that I was just not feeling like dealing with today. I rode the stationary bike in the gym for 50 mins and covered about 12 miles. Didn't really push it too much, just wanted to get something done. I ready a really interesting article in <a href=""http://www.bicycling.com/training-nutrition/training-fitness/transcendent-pain"">Bicycling Magazine</a> about the psychology vs. physiology of pain, suffering, and fatigue in endurance athletes. Talked about both biking and running and I found it fascinating! Certainly made a good chunk of the 50 minutes go by quickly.

<b><u>Wednesday - run</b></u>
Worked from home between several appointments, but was able to squeeze in a chilly 5k around the neighborhood before I had to scoot off to the dentist. Nothing spectacular about the run, just nice to get out!

<b><u>Thursday - bike</u></b>
Really nice bike ride with Megan today! We did the new 13.8-mile route and though it was a little chilly and windy, the sunshine was nice. Averaged 14.5 mph.

<b><u>Friday - yoga</u></b>
Nice class at lunch today - not much to say. Just a good, relaxing, stretchy yoga class!

<b>Bonus! Ride to Volunteer Checkpoint</b>
This weekend is Upstate SORBA's Cranksgiving Weekend race series - includes an Alley Cat ride on Friday night in downtown Greenville, Saturday is Day 1 of the Wild Turkey Enduro at Pleasant Ridge, and Sunday is Day 2 of the Enduro at Paris Mountain. Scott and I volunteered at a checkpoint for the alley cat Friday night - we were at Pedal Chic, and the challenge was for everyone to draw a bicycle with sidewalk chalk. How cute! So we biked between the start at Community Tap to Pedal Chic and back (total of ~4.5 miles). It was a chilly night to be out on the bikes!

<b><u>Saturday - run</u></b>
My chorus has their annual show today (matinee and evening performances!) so I was forced out into the cold earlier than I would have preferred. It turned out to be perfect, though, and I felt great throughout the run. One of my faster runs recently, too! Averaged 9:30 pace for a solid 10k. Wished I'd had time for more!

<b><u>Sunday - <s>bike</s> hike to volunteer</u></b>
Scott and I volunteered at one of the starting lines and had to scan every rider as they came through, separating them by ~45 second intervals. It was neat to get to talk to all of the riders, some of whom were Olympic and World Champion athletes! However, it was NOT fun being out in the middle of the woods in the pouring cold rain. We had to hike up Sulphur Springs from the upper parking lot, about 1.5 miles to our checkpoint, and then back down. I did not really enjoy that part, but I'm glad I got to be out there to help out!"

"event","Basically it's officially Summer, and I'm in love with it. Last weekend I went camping and Shannon came even though it was all last minute. It was pretty much amazing and we are obsessed with boat. Skiing and tubing are our lives. Shannon is so close to actually staying up. We guessed she was probably up for about six seconds. Haha yeah but she's close and by the end of the summer she will be a perfectionist. By the way Shannon and I like to be destructive and break things on the pavement. =)

Anyways, we got home yesterday and I went for a run. It felt good to run but I'm so incrediably out of shape, so I think I'm going to run everyday now. Today I woke up and went on the computer as usual. Then I vacuumed the pool. Oh yes, and I would like to say that skimming the pool is an art form and I'm addicted to it. Haha I'm weird and I know it.

Oh yeah and conversations with my sister last night made me happy. And conversations with Kelly were good too. I like operation blue bananas even though I find it near impossible. Yes only Kelly knows operation blue bananas. Haha we are weird and we know it. =)

Okay so I will spend the rest of the day outside in the pool by myself because I have no friends and what not. Oh yeah and I have zero plans for this week. I'm cool. I think that Shannon, me, Kelly, and Emily need to hang out this week sometime if that's cool with them because we are all so hot. Honostly though, Shannon is in love with Emily and Kelly and thinks they are amazing which makes me happy.

I <3 Summer! Awesome! =D"

"event","I like life lately! Yess! Saturday night was Milane's going away party thing so we went. Then we left early (me, kelly, emily, and jamie) and went to the out of line show. Shannon met up with us and stuff. The show was amazing and I had so much fun. I missed people and hanging out with them made me so happy. Then we wanted to sleep somewhere but I couldn't get ahold of my mom and kelly couldn't sleep over emilys so we didnt know what to do. Then kelly's mom came and jamie and her left becuase we didnt know what we were doing. Finally we decided we would just have to go to emilys so me and shannon slept over at em's. I think they liked eachother unless they lied to me. haha i hope they liked eachother. Yeah, then we slept and woke up and we went home. It was father's day yesterday so i had to go to my grandparents house and then when i got home kelly asked if i wanted to go to charlotte. We didn't end up going and went to brusters instead. It was fun we met up with people. After she came back here with me and we took beautiful pictures and went to bed. Today we are going skimboarding i think. 


I love how I deffinitly don't study for exams. That's such a great idea! Anyways, its really nice out and i want to go outside so goodbye!"

It was pretty exciting.
I came home after and took a nap.
Then I went to this place to look at houses with my parents.
After that we went out to eat at Applebees.
Then I came home, watched the Notebook, and slept.
Today I woke up at 11:30.
I ate breakfast and now I'm here.
I should study French but I don't want to.
Yeah so I'm kind of bored and what not.

"event","Today I went on the boat with this hot girl I know named Shannon. I'm obsessed with skiing times a million and a half. Seriously I freaking love water skiing. First I did one ski for a while but then I got stuck like on the wake and it knocked by back foot out of the strap and I lost my balance and fell. Yeah then I did two skis for freaking ever. Almost from one end of the lake to the other on skis. I was dead and my arms are jello now. Then Shannon tried and she made a good effort but just couldn't get up all the way. It was disapointing but I know she will do it. I'm just going to have to bring her on my boat again. Yay for boating, it is life.

How exciting is not having homework or laundry to do on a sunday. Ahhh I loved it. Three more days on school and then summer. Well plus exams and what not but those aren't as bad as school. I wonder what summer is going to be like. I wonder who I'm going to spend it with, if anyone. Ha yeah I will probably sit home in bordem everyday because friends is not part of my vocabulary. 

I need to be hardcore with lifting and volleyball this summer. I honostly need to put everything into it. I need to run and lift and play. I want to go to volleyball camps in good shape so I don't spend my time there getting in shape, but instead getting better at volleyball. That will be my goal. Yay. Anyways, I should go like watch a movie or something. Mmmmmk bye."

Then I had to get ready for the picnic so I did. Kelly called and asked what I was doing, and I was mad that I had to go to the picnic. Yeah but I had to go so I did. It was fun with the volleyball ladies. We went swimming and did our usual prank phone calls. Sluts 99? Ohh it slipped your mind. Hahaa that was the funniest thing freaking ever. Oh yeah and I love Shannon freaking Cerasoli to beyond death. Ahhh thank gosh for her.

Yeah so next week is three days of school and then a week of finals and then freaking summer. Uhh I hope summer is fun because if it's not I might just have to kill somebody.

Oh tomorrow is boat day and I need someone to come with me..I don't want to go all alone. I'm so beyond belief excited though. I need to water ski. Now. Ahhh so excited."

It was grand. But not really. 
I was bored out of my mind to be honest.

Wednesday was a volleyball meeting.
And open gym. They were fun.
I am in love with volleyball. Forever. 
And I need a roomate for Cortland. Now.

Thursday equaled Math B practice test.
I think I did pretty okay.
I think I can pass now. Before I was scared.
Now I have faith that I can do it. Haha.

Friday is school and then home.
No plans yet. But I want and need some.
I feel like going out Friday. Yes.

P.S. I don't like tv production.
Finals are really fun.
Especially when you don't learn all year.

I like sleep. So I'm going to go get some. Bye."

Then Kelly, Milane, and Jillian came over and it was awesome. I kind of had like a lot of fun and I really like our new sport with the volleyball and the baseball bat. Yeah, so we taped and stuff and it was super hot but we got through it with ice cream and pickles. We took sweet pictures and we looked sexy in them. Then I was debating on whether or not to go to Steph's because I have like beyond imagination amounts of homework. But I ended up going and it was pretty much freaking amazing. I love to laugh. Love it love it love it love it. Kim is kind of awesome and we are the most amazing tigers that hiss ever. And Shannon is life as usual because we are cool and beat eachother up. I kind of punched her in the throat but she deserved it because she attacked me. Yes and I hope Steph had a freaking amazing birthday because she deserves it a lot. 

Well now I'm home and I have to take a shower and do homework...ahhh! Honostly though, today is the first day in the longest time I can truely say that I had a good day. Everything was just perfect. It's like nothing bad ever existed and everyone was just happy to be with eachother. I wish everyday could be like today was. I feel happy today and it's maybe the best feeling ever. I think I've almost forgotten what it feels like to be truely happy. It mind sound dumb but it's so true. I am determined to make things happen like this more often. Good days."

"event","I have a friend. Just one. And her name is SHANNON and she freaking equals LIFE! We went to see the Sisterhood of the traveling pants and then went back to her house and watched the Moulin Rouge last night. Then I slept over and she made me breakfast in the morning because she is love. It was so fun because she it hottttttt and I'm obsessed with her. We talk about how the same exact things have happened to us with our friends and wonder if it was all becuase club volleyball took up so much time. I just really love her to death though, and she saves me from being friendless. Basically, she is all I have right now and it's hard. As amazing as this girl is and how much I say I love her because I do, it's important to say that <FONT size=4><STRONG><U>my old friends can never be replaced</U></STRONG></FONT>. I miss them so much...so much. I guess I'm just trying to make the best of moving on, but it's just hard because I'm constantly thinking about what my old friends are doing together at every moment and if they EVER think about me or miss me. For some reason though it seems that they have moved on way to easily and I have been replaced by better things, and nobody knows what it feels like to be forgotten about by you're best friends unless its happened to them. Even if I never go back to being friends with the people I love the most,&nbsp;I will never forget everything we experienced together. Nobody I ever meet will be able to take the place of these girls and no memory will ever come close to being as amazing as the ones made with them. Maybe the reason I want all of my friends to know that they will never be replaced is because if by any slim chance they still care, I never want them to feel how I feel everyday of my life."

"event","Last weekend was Penn State and it was amazing with my freaking awesome volleyball girls. I love them so much and they showed me that there are so much better things out there for me just by being the freaking amazingest people ever. The whole thing with the coach and my parents was kind of ugly but you know what, its over and it still was a freaking sweet weekend with the girls. I seriously have never laughed  as hard as I was on the way home with Kim and Sam. It was freaking insane and we like red trucks and trees. Haha wow I love them. It was really wierd because I was totally out of control and being like insanly crazy with the entire team this weekend and it made me think back to old times with friends. I wonder why I stopped acting like that and being myself (all crazy) around them. Sometimes I think its just because I feel out of place, but really I don't know...things just changed. Ew for change I miss old times. 

When I got home and read an entry in this one journal it really upset me. I know that one sentence was about me but it basically was like oh well things happen too bad and brushed it off. I guess they are over me and don't want to even be close anymore but whatever because I've clearly been replaced by way better people than I ever could be so it's all good. Not really but we will pretend, and its the absolute truth...we will pretend everything is good but things will never get better or go back. I no longer have you to call my best friend. I no longer know who you are. We will never talk about the things we talked about before. We will never do the crazy things we once did. We won't spend summer nights just being crazy girls or laugh together and not need someone else to be there. Things are never going back as much as I would do to make them. What really makes me get upset is thinking back to this one time that I asked you, ""Do you think we will be best friends forever"" and you told me that you deffintly thought that we would always be best friends no matter what. And then I told you that I thought that I didn't think we would because I knew something like this would happen. The worst got the best of us and it's over just like that. You've clearly moved on, unfortunatly for me it takes more time than this, but I will...eventually...someday...hopefully. I'm just sorry about the way things had to end and mostly I'm sorry because I miss you."

I didn't do anything all weekend being sick and all. I watched Moulin Rouge and it's basically life. I read my book for independant read thing for Eglish. I read the wedding for it and I'm glad I got it done because I know I wouldn't have time to read this week. Yup so that was my weekend.

This week nothing special is happening. I have model un friday and I'm really nervous because my topic with my country is really hard. I have to rewrite my speech sometime. Yeah I'm sure it will get done I just think model un is pretty much pointless. I hope I get better like really soon because I need to go to practice this week. I don't know if I'm going to school tomorrow. It depends on how I feel in the morning. I actually want to go because I hate making up work but if I feel like how I did today then there is no way I can go.

I have shitty friends. 
I mean I used to have shitty friends.
Now I'm friendless. 
But it's better than being with people that treat me horribly.
Or is it?
I'm tired and I'm really good at procrastinating. 
Volleyball is almost over. 
It saddens me.
This weekend I don't have anything- no tournament.
I plan on sitting home because I'm just that cool.
Summer's going to suck.
Oh yeah tell me if anyone might want to do volleyball camps with me.
That won't decide to pick someone else to room with, 
after they told me they would room with me.
But hey who would want to room with me?
After all, I'm just stupid drama.
Crying everyday over missing people is getting old.
I'm confused and frustrated.
Basically this is the story of my wonderful life.
No sleep, no friends, no life, no volleyball, equals no happiness.

Yup, so I'm confused like usual. In general about my life. More specifically about people. Yeah I know...specific. I don't know it's just that I hate the way I feel when I'm home and with my friends and then when I'm at volleyball I see people that make me feel so much better. I feel like at home it's always a huge effort for me to fit in. At volleyball I'm myself and it's so much more relaxing. Being with people that make me act differently is stressful and I don't know, I'm just confused. Old friendships seem to be dying out and it sucks that it's become apparent that I'm just a burdon to everyone. I just know that volleyball isn't going to last forever so I need to do something about my life at home and school. 

I guess I'm just used to being your best friend and haven't realized how much it hurts to be second place. I miss old times and more than old times I miss you."

Em and me were crying pretty much throughout the whole thing. Before the movies we went to Earthtones and they got cheesecake and drinks and stuff and I got a cookie as usual because I like them a lot. After the movie I was going to sleep over at Emily's house but I couldn't because my parents are silly and decided that I need sleep. So I came home to a dark house and I was shaking and I didn't know what to do so I watched some Sex and the City. Then I was okay and finally went to sleep.

Oh yeah, and my life is over because my WHAP exam is Tuesday and I honostly know about three percent of World History. So, yeah this test is going to go great.

Last Weekend I went up north with Rachel. I must say I did have a blast! But it feels liek we arent too much of friends anymore. She has a new best friend who she rather talk to all the time. A new best friend who she can walk with in the halls. A new best friend to spend the night with every weekend. This new best friend also makes her very mean!!! I guess I just have to find a new best friend, any takers??

Well Tuesday - Back to school. That sucked!! But my mommy came to my basketball game *we lost* bc she didnt go to work because she went to my uncles funeral! Than that night when i  got home from my basketball game my rents werent home. So i called my dads cell and asked where they were. He said they we at the Urgent Care Clinic and they will be home in a couple of hours so just get to bed.. So I went to bed and when i got up Wed. Morning They still werent home.. So I called his cell phone again, They were in the emergency room. I guess my ma was having really bad stomach pains.. THey were running tests on her all night. THey couldnt figure out what was wrong with her.. But i guess Wed. at like 7 they went in and did surgery to see what was wrong, her appendix ruptered and she had sists on her overies. So that night after practice i went and visited her!! That was like the most scariest thing ever! She looked absolutely horrible, she was on oxgen, she was liek purple and had these things on her legs to keep her blood circulating!! But we ended up leaving around 9*ish.. Thursday School sucked as usual :(! Than we didnt do too well in our basketball game*Lost* than i went to the hospital to see my mommy! She looked much better:)! Than after me n my daddy went to walmart and got home around 10*30ish so i went to bed!! Yesterday- School sucked!! I had tickets to go to the hank williams jr concert but me n bry went to his *kinda* cousins wedding!! it was fun!! We went and visited my mom for a while!! THan went back to the wedding till like 12!! Than i went back to brys and spent the night!! Got up this A.m went and got Mcdonalds breakfeast *Seen Ashley Christine*!!! Now im just chillen home!! havent been able to do this all week!!! 
AND MY MOMMY MIGHT BE ABLE TO COME HOME TOMORROW INSTEAD OF TUESDAY!If she walks more today and can eat and keep her food down!! Ahh I miss her sooo much!!!!!!:):):):)!!!

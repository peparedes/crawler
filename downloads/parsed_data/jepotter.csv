I'm hoping by at least December to have a regular computer, or at least a new web because the stupid web we have now is dumb...  I'm actually really surprised that we can get on here, because everywhere else, like bebo, is blocked.  Xanga actually works, too, I think...  Anyways...  A little update, I guess...

1)  Uh...  Auditions for Show Choir are approaching shortly (next Monday OR Tuesday!)
2)  ""Wicked"" by Gregory Macguire is an AWESOME book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3)  I gotta go, the bell is going to ring.  Maybe on Monday I can get back on here, since this still works here at school!!!  *crosses fingers to hope this doesn't jinks it*

"event","We came back on Sunday from Chicago. It was a lot of fun. We went to Wicked, which was excellent. Also, Medieval Times was interesting, except one of my best friend hates eating food with his fingers. The Sears Tower wasn't that exciting to me, I used to go to Chicago a lot so the city was that amazing. I am a second photographer in my dad's photography business so I had to best camera there. It's funny the camera was the lowest quality one that we have and it could easily outstrip the rest.

School sucks when you come back, I'm still not used to sleeping at the regular time yet. In my room we would stay up every night and ""girl talk"". Dang, I miss it, School is very boring. And of course, the fact that we have to prepare for the mile makes it worse. Talk later.

"event","Well, today was my first day of school. It was so damn confusing. First, my first period class was dropped because it only had three people and I didn't know about it. So I got sent to the guidance office. Was there the whole first period. Went to Algebra I, then P.E./Health. That was confusing, and I hate both of them. Then to word processing, where the teacher was a bitch. Then to choir, the fun class where we will have bonding, and she will take us camping, she said, weird I know. Then Spanish where my name is Esperanza. Then, to biology where my teacher is one of the many that go to my church. Then to English, where the teacher also goes to my church. It was great, we are going to read The Odyssey and Romeo and Juliet. That will be pretty cool. Then, I got called to the office after school and I got my new schedule. Then my friend and I went home and we got my mom to sign stuff. Then, mom went off on how I should be in T.A.G, talented and gifted, and she went to the school and found out I was they just hadn't talked to me yet. Ugh... too much stuff.

~Broken Picture Perfect~

Your picture hands on my ceiling
I see your locks I love to run my fingers through
I see your eyes I know every detail to
I see your lips -- I hear you speak

My picture perfect heart
Broken into pieces
Your lies told
I'm getting so cold

Painting on a wall
Of dreaded memories
Again I see the thing I love
Knowing I cannot

You ask me why I cry
I lie and say I don't
Hoping finally you'll see
My reason is just you

Painting a picture perfect heart
Isn't so easy
When you're broken
So this will be, my broken picture perfect"

Then, since that was the 7th, I looked and saw that on the 5th was Gypsie's birthday... She's now 3... Then, I saw, on the 10th was when Bret broke up with me for the second time. On the 13th is the first time Bret asked me out... Is it just me, or does it seem sort of weird that important dates just... Just seem to be 3 days between each other when it comes to things like Evil/Bret? Well, almost... December 26th -- Evil and I started being 'us', Bret asked me out for the second time, and Dad was buried... 3 things all in the same day! The things that are out of place are technical breaks with Evil and me. They don't really count, except for once -- January 15th through January 18th. *sighs* To end this, I'l doing a poem that I'm sort of working on...

--Untitled as of the second--

Calling a name that is heard by no one but your ears
Seeing a face that is seen by no one but your eyes
Longing for that person to be there before you but reaching out, you feel only your pillow
Crying a tear that is known by no one but your cheek

*****

Okay, it sucks. It's just... I miss him. I talked to him over the phone today... He told me he's got 6 months probation and 8 hours community service. That was after he called Padme and Angel coneheads (that's what _I_ call them!!!)... When I laughed about the community service (I was joking!), he hung up. That's all I've heard of him since MONDAY!!  Sorry, but I miss him... *sighs*

"event","Flaws are good.

Or at least they are in my stories, no matter if it is fan fiction or stories I want to get published. I prefer characters with deep set psychological issues. Maybe it is because they remind me of myself. Self-harm is grand, hearing voices is wonderful, not being able to escape yourself is paradise. While I enjoy the light hearted stories in which everyone ends happily ever after, I live for the dark and tormented novels.

Perhaps that is why I choose the doomed couples to love. Anakin and Padme from Star Wars, Lily and James from Harry Potter. Both we know from the start have no chance for a happily ever after. Maybe that is why I choose them, because they bring the promise of pain and suffering in the end.

I have my own flaws. I've heard voices that have spoken to me, I seem to have three different people inside me, truly, not just a joke Jackie. Most of the time the one I have named Emra is in control, she is blind to the other two, never knowing when they will strike and take command of the empty vessel of my soul. The one that shows up more frequently of the other two I have called Det. Det seems to see all, but doesn't. He is unaware of the third lurking beneath the surface. The last is the mood I am in now, the true mood, which often never comes into complete control. Even then he, as all the personalities have bodies of their own, is afraid of what he is. 

My outlook is dark when I become Andi's, the dark's, slave. I know nothing other than pain and seeing the cloud behind the silver lining in my life. Strange, there are people all over the world who could be reading this, I don't know why they would want to but still, and I tell this more than I tell my friends. Even my shrink. I don't see my shrink anymore, she never got anywhere with me other than finding locked doors in my mind to which I didn't even have the key. 

My flaws are projected in to my characters. If you have read one of my fan fiction, Red Angel, a twisted version of James, you would see that. Already James, this is a Harry Potter fan fiction, is a cutter and possessive and he is eleven years old. Not a far cry from the truth, however, I know there are people younger than that who do. His life will only get worse and worse.

I have another oddity. I seem to be more like the male characters in their attitude and mannerisms than the females. I am a girl, as you might have guessed, but girls in stories, even if they are heroines, seem weak, defenseless. Guys, though, are strong, powerful. More role models than the feminine characters. 

I must go, I feel the blankness of Andi being clouded over by the giddy Emra. Farewell to those with sanity and to those with none.

Since I'm worried, I've got a bunch of my little favorite sayings to post... Some of them, I don't know where they came from. Found them, liked them, wrote them down... Yeah yeah yeah...

***

--Timeless Love--

Timeless
Don't let it fade out of sight 
Just let the moments sweep us both away
Lifting us to where we both agree
It just...
Timeless love

***

--No One Else--

I think that I may love him
He believed in me, when no one else did
He befriended me, when no one else did
He was there, when no one else was
He saved me, when no one else could
In a storm or in calm, he will be the shelter that keeps me safe
His love will help me get through laughter and pain

***

--Broken Dreams--

Stuck inside a dream, lost without a care
Forgot the reality, now I'm swimming in despair
I thought I had it all, but it was all a lie
No time for self sorrow, no tears that I can cry
The past comes to haunt me, ringing through my head
Don't try to save me, for I am already dead
It's the perfect form of pain, the only thing that's true
All those broken dreams, I can finally see through
It's so hard to reach, my soul is crawling on the floor
The taste of you is all I need, coming back for more

***

--Forbidden Love--

They warmed me about him
They called him dangerous, reckless, defying
But I couldn't help it and by doing so not only did I hurt myself but all those I vowed to protect
I should have listened
But it was worth it
They told me a Jedi shall know no fear, no hated, no love
But I couldn't help it and by doing so I put everyone I love in danger
I should have listened
But it was worth it

***

It takes a minute to meet someone, a day to like someone, and a week to love someone, but it takes a life time to forget someone.

***

First I liked you, then I loved you. Now I'm afraid to lose you.

***

He handed her twelve roses; eleven real, one fake; he said, ""I'll love you till the last one dies.""

***

Now I lay down for my nightmares to begin 
I wish for one person to be here for me
That person can't though because he left my heart long ago

***

Forever alone in the darkness of my mind
I'll lie down my life just to b in your arms one last time before I do die...
Forever alone I'll be...
Without you hear next to me...

***

((My favorite))

Darkness quickly steals the light that shined within her eyes
She slowly swoallowed all her fear and sooths her mind with lies
Well, all she wants and all she needs are reasons to survive 
A day in which the sun will take her artificial life

***

Maybe I'm a witch
Lost in time
Running through the fields of Scotland
By your side
Maybe you're the knight
Who saved my life
Maybe we faced the fire side by side
Here we are again
Under the same sky...

***

Something in your eyes
Makes me want to lose myself
Makes me want to lose myself in your arms
and something in your voice
Makes my heart beat fast
I hope this feelings lasts for the rest of my life

***

You were right there for me
In my dreams
I'll always see you
Soar above the skye
In my heart there'll always be
A place for you for all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am there you'll be

***

"event","The field trip to The Sands was okay. It was better than skating last year, I can't skate for the life of me. Jackie and I traveled on two different buses and I was stuck with only two of my friends who, let me put it this way, are lacking in the brain. And they always fight with each other, very annoying if you are trying to mediate, no, I do not think I am a Jedi.

When we got there I did not play sand volleyball, rather I just sat around on my butt during the tournament. My team came close to last I believe, though the winner cheated! We also had the most volleyball players, pathetic if you ask me.

Then I went over where my friends were hanging out. They were putting on sand on to of the wannabees, one of which splashed me later. My friends were making the wannabees into mermaids. We took pictures and then ate lunch. It was after lunch that the trouble started.

Katlin, one of my very loud and obnoxious friends, decided that she too wanted to be buried. So we buried her and just left it at that. She want to be something like the wannabees were. My friends decided to make her into an angel. Of course, then the trouble began.

We started to make fun of Katlin because she is, well, flat-chested. We dumped cups of sand on her chest and then laughed while she tried to get it off, yes I know, we are heartless. Then, Katlin and Kayleigh got into a fight about who had the bigger *shudders* chest! When they couldn't agree they asked us to judge and of course, no way in hell did we care or want to look at it! They argued for the rest of the day.

I think the next thing was started by Andrew spraying water at us. Then, some of the wannabees dumped the cups full of water and buckets full of water on each other. Next, we started too. Well, actually I stayed out of it until, Briana, one of the wannabees, splashed me with a bucket of water that got me head to toe on the front side, thankfully, none on the back. 

So for the rest of the time I mostly sun bathed to dry. We also talked to our teacher about the crumbling system of our school district and religion, which is always fun because I am a liberal stuck in rural Iowa land of the overly conservative. Actually, I enjoy going head to head with the conservatives, it's always fun to see even if you beat them they still think they won.

Oh, and I did not get sun burnt, so ha ha Jackie!

I figured that the whole fucking day was going to be horrible! Well, ends up, I loved the day. My powerhour came in 3rd place (we got tired... LoL), I got soaked (almost as much as Erin), I did feel like crap for a while, but it was still cool... I even talked to Evil while we were just... There. Nothing lovey dovey, just plain talked. It was sort of weird... The day was funny, though. Wish I could put it all into words, but I can't. I can't think of how to explain it!! Now, the bus ride home... :D Nothing again lovey-dovey, but he did catch me looking at him a fews and I did catch him a few times looking at me... Well, it started off where Amelia, Kristen and I shared a seat. I as in one of muh ""touch me you die"" modes -- Got sun burned. So, I let Kristen sit on the inside by Amelia. There were so many times that we hit bumps that I also flew into Tommy... I got tired of it. I had not even an inch on the seat... Usually if I do that, I have another seat or person to lean on, but we were in the very back with the short seat. So, I got down on the ground. I had to wedge muhself almost inbetween the seats (my ribs and up) and the other curled up close to the seat so the teachers didn't catch me and yell at me. During that time, Evil was listening to his CD player, I just thinking... I had let Kristen borrow my dumb -- Really, it is -- CD player. I kept trying to get comfortable... So I ended up lay my head almost on Evil's leg and my elbow as well. Hell, I was comfortable -- No one saw -- and best? I was happy!! Only really bad parts of the day -- Evil (do you know how much I try typing out his name?!) didn't play volley ball, I got sun burned sort of badly, AND... Evil was checking out the others chicks while we were talking. Hannah, Bre, Stephanie, Kayla, Chesley, and Kelsey... I wish that we didn't have so many 'hot' chicks in our grade... *sighs* Eh, why does it matter? Today was a good day... I'm not going to let that fact bring me down -- Because I also caught him staring at me!!! Wahahaha... :P Well, got to go. TWO DAYS LEFT OF THE HELL HOLE!! ~Jackie"

I mean, first I'm going to have to see Shantell and all of them that I don't want to see... Last night Evil told me he's going to either have to work his ass off this summer to pay off fines for stealing the bike or else go to juvi for a month or two... Seriously!! I  love summers with him!! He and Bret truly do make my summers worth living... Plus, this would be our first summer of sneaking around to be with each other... Yeah... *sighs* I can't wait till High School, though. It should be a blast!! Well, got to go. I'm doing dishing while typing -- I don't think I'm summer to let the damn cup that I'm washing uh...

Jake asked Erin and I to publish Marcus's story (funny, actually) on Fan Fiction, but I don't think we'll get around to that... Social Studies we have to do newspaper reports... Almost done with that... Then English, have to do a damn panel discussion -- On being FOR abortion! The only way I'm for abortion is if the woman would be killed in the birth or it was rape that the baby was conceived under. I mean, if let's say I ended up pregnant with Evil's baby... I'd keep it. Well, maybe give it up for an open adoption (because I've been told Evil and I would make a cute child)... But still. It is my own child. I couldn't stand killing it -- even if it is just a fetus. I would hate to even think about it... But if I were raped or going to die... Then I'd have an abortion. Now, more on today... LoL. When I got home, I found out I get another dog. Aunt Peggy can't take care of her dog, Angel. For fucking crying out loud, she had no food and only alge for fucking water!! Can you say ew??? So, now I have Padme Amidala Worthington (Angel's sister), Patches Lee Harrington-Worthington, Samantha (Sammi) Marie Worthington, Charles (Toto) James Worthington, and Angelic (Angel) Star Sanders-Worthington. I also started to clean out the pool. Goblets, was that ever discusting!! I had to shower for an hour after getting out of the pool from cleaning it --- It's still not all the fucking way clean!! Good parts about that? A) Get the pool faster and B) Saw Evil and Bret jumping on the trampoline -- HOTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!! Of course, Evil is a lot better than Bret. Evil is just... *starts fanning self* LoL. Sorry, in a Shilah/Kodi sort of mood, if you can't tell. No one's wreck it, yet!

The Spider

It hangs there under my bathroom sink.
It is just living its life the way it always has.
It has been there for the longest time.
I'm not sure why I let it live.
I despise spiders in all their awe inspiring webs.
I don't hurt it, it doesn't hurt me.
It is a delicate balance one in which I rule.
But, do I have any right to kill the spider just because taller, stronger?
I see the world's wars in everything,
and I wish that just for once we would be like me and leave the figurative spider alone.

The Boy in the Red Shirt

Oh, young child of eight why do you haunt me dreams?
Sicken me beyond the point of belief?
Is is your red shirt a blaze with the fires of the sun?
Or your blond hair simmering in the morning light?
Or is it your age so young?
No, none of those things what sickens me is myself.
Little boy of nightmares why did you come?
I already what you trying to tell me.
I am just not ready for it.
Small boy in the red please wait until another day.

The Defiant

""I will not be like them!"" The girl shouted into the wind.
""I will not fight with everyone, I will be the most extraordinary person ever!""
The childish female, however, forgot her promise for a little while.
She picked fights, flaunted her skills, and was smug.
""I am better than you in everything!"" She cried to her cowering opponent.
Or at least what seemed to be cowering to her.
Her brown eyes opened, as they always did when they blinded by false realities.
Then, she saw the truth.
She had become a bickering, possessive, follower.
No, she want to be free and a leader.
Ever free she walked herself back to her place, a helper she would stay.
Leave the fighting for heroes, she thought.
But, it takes someone strong to always be there.
Ever defiant they must be.

Okay, I have no clue what the third one is about it just kind of flowed out of me. Oh, well-Erin"

I have a lot on my mind other than Star Wars. For one my friends. Amelia is being very annoying, first she says I am stupid for liking Star Wars and then she tries to say that she knows more about it than I do! Grrr... Star Wars is much better than MTV or reality shows which she rots her insignificant blonde brain to toast with.  It takes more brain cells, which she has little of, to watch Star Wars than that crap! Sorry to anyone that likes it but I grow up in a bit of more cultured world. Give me Gone with the Wind and classical music rather than wrestling books or the crap she listens to! I mean, come on, she reads wrestling books and she tells me Star Wars is a waste of time!

Then there is Janelle, the I'm not a lowly teenager but I will prove it in one second, not that I'm not that. She thinks she knows everyone, well news flash, you don't know anything about me! I told my lit. class this morning that I was an introvert, and she laughed. Sorry, Janelle just because I'm not like you and don't get high every damn day of my fucking life and getting so drunk I can't remember what I am doing doesn't mean that I am not a fucking introvert.

Frankly, I'm tired of it all. Jackie, I know I don't blow up on you often but for heaven's sake! You're in eighth grade ignore Evil for just one day! Thanks that all I have to rant about you.

Now, it is my turn to talk about my lies. Jackie might seem the type to lie a lot but I can say for sure that I have more experience than her. I've been lying like a manaic since third grade and I do it every day. So much that don't notice it now. That I have two sets of people inside me. The one who doesn't think about it and believes what the other tries to tell it is a lie, and the one who knows the truth and is permanently depressed. I like that one who sees nothing better than the other one for obvious reasons, it is better for my mental health.

~Stay Strong~

I can tell by how I cry I've betrayed everything I've felt
I can tell by how I smile I've already started to give you my heart
Standing stong as you say those three little words
Must hold my boundries and not let them roll off my tongue
How long can I hold what I truely feel inside?
If I say it, then I allow the hurt to come to me
Rip into my soul and tear apart my heart
Painfully allow the demons to fulfill me again
I was shattered but now I'm fixed, so I must stay strong and never utter
These three little words
So powerful and true
You'll never know
How I love you

(side not: Yeah, right! I told him I think later that day that I thought I was falling in love with him...)

***

~Can't Deny~

His eyes burned into her trying to see her true soul
Her heart pounded against her chest trying to get the words out
Why can't he get it that she does care, but she can't show it?
The love her heart wants to show him isn't allowed by herself or by others
Lingering in the air, her mind holds back all urges to just say...
She knows she can't yet to hear the very thing that she's terrified of roll out of his lips, she wants to say it right back
Because she knows that it's true
She can't deny it

(side not: Right...)

***

~I Do~

Her voice I hear,
My heart goes on
But in a way, it stops
She is what's holding me back from saying the words I truly mean
Though so badly I want to just say I love you
No one knows I mean it,
But I do 
With all my heart,
I do
But because of her,
I can't
I just want you to know,
I do

(side not: Well, I've said it now... It doesn't mean a fucking thing!)

***

~Long~

Of all the things I long to see,
I long to see him the most
Just to be with him and no one else
Crying out all my tears, because there's no one else around
Maybe I should take my plan and go erase my past
I want you in my future,
I really truely do

(side note: And for some messed up fucking reason, I still do!)

***

~Heart~

My heart is like five candles
Together they shine so brightly,
Alone, you can barely see
My heart is filled by my family, friends, writing, self, but most of all, love
Love shines the brightest among the things that make up my entire being
When one candle is gone, the candles still shine on, but they are not as powerful

...........

Okay, sorry, but I'm stopping. Talking to my friend, Bobby, telling him what's going on with Evil, and I'm fucking near tears, again...

~Worth~

I'm going to sit, act like I am fine
I'm going to stare, straight into my lies
I'm going to hide my tears, right behind my dreaded eyes
I need you and you alone
Not happiness
Or lying for hiding
Or crying
All to make things seem worth while

~Tossing~

There's an empty place beside me
As I lay my head down to rest
The one person I long for it to be
Can be but yet my best

Tossing 'n turning
My eyes are burning
Crying the tears
That no one else hears

Dreams of how I am so scared
Of someone knowing about us
Yet do I dare
To let my love for you turn to rust

Tossing 'n turning
My eyes are burning
Crying the tears
That no one else hears

Someday they'll know
How I feel inside
So that way I can show
How I feel and not have to hide

~No One Knows~

No one knows that last night I cried myself to sleep
No one knows that when I wake up, screaming from nightmares,
I look around for one thing that never seems to be there
No one knows that when i Hear my name, I beg for it to be someone else who they are calling
No one knows that I can't stand it here, that I wish I didn't have to live to see the next day
No one knows
No one knows me

(side note: But Erin and Evil!)

~Angel (Part 4)~

Why, oh Angel, do you make me fall in love with people who only hurt me?
Each time you think you got it right, you've found that one for me, YOU'RE WRONG!
I made him cheat on my friend
She still doesn't even know
Now, I love him, like I promised I wouldn't
Yet here my heart is being shattered
Crystals fall from my heart once like the glass I loved to see stained with blood
My heart can't take this, Angel!
I love him so much
You've made me into a liar
A bad person at that
Angel, you're wrong
Love is not happiness
This is all just pain!
I'm young, Angel
I can't deal with it
Why are you here?!
You're just causing me pain...
Please... Please...
Just go away!
Or make this pain stop
So I can live without this feeling
Please

I think it is much easier to get Star Wars spoilers, though, because Star Wars is a movie and the pictures come out. I mean one line from Harry Potter won't spoil everything. A movie still, however, well... a picture speaks a thousand words.

With a little more than a week away from the release of Star Wars III to the theaters I have been going nuts. Just ask Jackie, any mention of the date May 19 or dates around them will get me to ramble about Star Wars for hours. Our band and choir directors are lucky that I'm not skipping the concert, which is on May 19, and go see the movies and be crying my eyes out.

Crying my eyes out brings me to something else. I've looked forward to this movie since the first time I saw the original trilogy. Darth Vader has always been my favorite character so I wanted to see how he came to be. It's just... well the movie is going to be very emotional for me. See all the Jedi die and Padme too... and, no, Jackie, not your dog.

Woah, three paragraphs about Star Wars. That is very weird, well see ya."

"event","Jackie won't get her butt in gear so I guess I'm just going to talk again. Okkkkkaaaaaaaayyyy let's see I've already talked about the many times I've heard voices, also that... well not much more than that. Umm... I'll come back later after I harass Jackie for leaving me alone here. *Goes off and cries (not really but just pretend).*"

"event","Hey, this is Erin and I'm from fanfiction.net. Jackie is here somewhere... anyway. I don't have much to say because I'm not really feeling anything. You know the feeling, you just exist. Breathe and exhale, breathe and exhale. Nothing too exciting. I'm very insane and have been known to hear voices. Well, at least it's a conversation starter, almost as bad as the weather. I've never really done this before so I guess I will just ramble on and on about nothing so I better stop now. See ya later!"

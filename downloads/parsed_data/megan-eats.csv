<a href=""http://www.itsagreenbeanworld.com"">Green Bean</a> in Rogers was fantastic for lunch!  I got a salad with fresh mixed greens, arugala, asparagus, beets, cherry tomatoes, sprouts, cheddar cheese, freshly made wheat bread with olive oil and some great hummus.  Also, fruit tea with lemon and mint with a coffee to go for under $9?!  I felt like crazy Rachel Ray on $40 a Day.

They get all their stuff from the local Farmer's Market, as well as their grains - they come from the War Eagle Mill.

I never thought local could taste so very good."

It has a pom-ish flavor, but it's more of just an after taste.  I wanted something full bodied!  Maybe next time I'll use juice not from concentrate OR the real thing."

but without tahini paste..it just wasn't as tasty as it could have been.  It had such potential, though!  I will try again soon, WITH said paste.

Chocolate peanutbutter loaf
This was made out of despiration when I wanted something for dessert but was without eggs or chocolate chips.  I made some batter with soymilk instead of eggs and used some Omega spread (which is just like butter, only..not.)  I made my first vegan dessert!  

I put it all into two tiny loaf pans and they are still baking.  Update soon on the edible status of these loaves."

Oven-roasted eggplant is my new favorite thing.  


Here is a very green soup!  It's made with onions, garlic, pureed blanched spinach and herbs.  This didn't last very long, as it was perhaps the tastiest spinach soup ever (I used soymilk instead of moo-milk and I couldn't even tell the difference).  It's paired with a big hunk of simple soda bread, made from wheat and white flour, salt, baking soda, buttermilk and whatever herbs you prefer to add.  I like sage, thyme and rosemary, mmmm.

This was my first attempt cooking with eggplant:
<img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/181/403565017_c7542c3af7.jpg"">
I just love how they look!  Ah. Anyway!

I cut the purple guy into cubes and salted them, to drip out some moisture for about 30 minutes.  I boiled some whole wheat penne and added the eggplant cubes during the last 5 minutes of its cooking time.

Lesson learned from this recipe: pesto is besto when made with fresho...Well, what I mean to say is that I was still without my food processor (though now it is out of storage, hurrah!), so I used crushed dry herbs and mint to make a mock-pesto.  Nuh uh, not even nearly flavorful enough.  

I grated lots of parmesan on top, which definitely helped.  Walnuts also helped!  

My verdict on this recipe is that it would have been rather tasty, had I had a proper food processor.  This just means that I must try it again some day!


Leftover Veg Soup

This soup
<img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/167/403565037_cbb222dacd.jpg"">
might not look too tasty, but mmmm, it is!

I like to take the bits and pieces of all the vegetables I have left from previous dishes and make a nice pot of potpourri soup.  

This one contained cabbage, baby carrots, scallions, red potatoes, portobello mushrooms, ginger, rosemary, basil, oregano, salt&pepper, paprika and a cup of cream.  I also added a cup of barley as an afterthought, which was an excellent decision.  Next time I will add even more.

This is a great winter soup, it cooks up fast and lasts a long long time! 

I have since improved on this by leaps and bounds, adding egg and parmesan cheese (sounds icky, huh?  Well, let me tell you - it's super good).  I add more barley now and top with parsley and feta cheese. Mmm.


Chocolate Festival

I went to the third annual Chocolate Festival in Eureka Springs, Arkansas this past weekend.  It was absolutely worth the $12 ticket!  

Tables of chocolate samples, fudge, fruits and even chocolate milk were everywhere, as were chocolate fountains with everything imaginable to dip in.  (I was not a fan of the colored white chocolate variety, though...it looked like paint!)

We got to take a box around with us to take home as much as we could carry!  Imagine a buffet of strictly chocolate. 
 It was also the 100th anniversary of the Hershey's Kiss, so needless to say, there were heaps of kisses to be found.  As soon as you entered the door, people were literally stuffing your coat pockets with kisses.

I have to say that my favorite was the table of organic dark chocolate.  I could have taken a box full of just that home with me.  It is hard to really enjoy corporate-manufactured, waxy milk chocolate once you've developed a taste for dark chocolate from the health food store.

They also had a chocolate cake/anything made with chocolate competition, and the entries were then auctioned off.

This is an event that I strongly suggest to any chocolate lover!  It is worth the trip and the money.  Definitely.

Actually, I've moved (and in the process of moving I was hard-up for proper food and cooking space).  I don't yet have all my cooking supplies out of storage, but I have enough!  Pardon the ugly dishes.

I made some vegetarian wontons the other night.  They called for shiitake mushrooms, but I couldn't find any at the store so I used portobello instead.  They turned out very tasty!  I boiled them with veg broth, some cabbage and scallions; very yummy.  The wrapping took me a little longer than expected, but it was worth it.

I attempted to make yogurt from 2% milk without a yogurt-maker.  Here it is, staying warm in the oven.  I'm not sure what I didn't do properly, but it did not set up very well and I had to pour it out :(  I suppose if it is a disaster the second time I'll try to find a yogurt-maker.  I am not a yogurt-maker."

"event","This is an article addressing the ever-present ""organic"" and ""all-natural"" labels on just about every food product these days.  It is not news to me that companies are using these phrases to boost sales to a nation which, on the outside, attempts to be concered with what they put into their mouths.  I did, however, enjoy the bit of design discussed on the topic:

""Having established a design paradigm that succeeds in selling food that is often more expensive than conventional groceries, the design world should perhaps rejoice. This is not the case. Some top brand and package designers find the cartoonish animals and bad hippie typefaces as grating as a self-righteous vegan at a barbecue.""

I liked this bit about steam:

""Steam makes food look hot and appetizing, and can be created in a variety of ways. Cotton balls soaked in water and microwaved will give you up to one minute of steam. Dry ice placed behind the food item works well, but gives off more vapors if you place the dry ice in water. A cigarette or piece of incense is another option, but you must blow on the smoke to make it look like steam, and not smoke. Some photographers have an assistant blow cigarette smoke through a straw placed behind the food. Movie prop and special effects supply houses sell smoke pellets that some food stylists use, but once again you must blow on it so that it is not so strongly directional. I have used all of these options, but have found dry ice and smoke pellets the most useful.""

I bought a tiny loaf of heavy, multigrain bread tonight, along with a cheese I have never tried: sage darby.  It's supposed to be best with fruit or dark red wine, but I had bits on some of the bread with some slices of cucumber on the side.  

It was faaantastic!  The cucumber was really great between bites of the cheese & bread; it was very crisp and refreshing and paired very well with the heavy bread and savory cheese.

I used one of those sauce+noodles-in-a-box (by <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Thai-Pavilion-Authentic-Noodles-8-5-Ounce/dp/B000FAKUW8/sr=1-1/qid=1167421860/ref=sr_1_1/103-2583873-3739820?ie=UTF8&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&s=grocery"">Thai Pavilion</a>).  I was skeptical of the quality of such a thing and did not think it would measure up to the tasty pad thai I have had in restaurants in the past.

It was surprisingly delicious!  It was labeled 'mild' but it certainly wasn't bland.  I used fresh bean sprouts and green onions <strike>(the box called for scallions but it was just fine with the green onions)</strike>.  I have yet to be successful with cooking tofu (unless it must be pulverised into a paste) so I used shrimp in this one.  I am cheap, so I found the least-expensive shrimp I could that was not small and sad looking.  This means that I bought a shrimp cocktail platter.  

I did not have time to thaw the shrimp so I had to cook them frozen.  This is bad in that one must cook the shrimp longer and thus they become a little chewy.  This is good (if you are using shrimp-with-tails) in that the tails of frozen shrimp crack off very easily!  It made that aspect of prep go much faster.

I put a small chopped tomato and some diced raw peanuts on top.  I had some mint tea with this massive plate of yummy pad thai.

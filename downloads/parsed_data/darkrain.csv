I graduate tomorrow!!! Yay!... It's about time... I'm sick of high school... I'm sick of stupid high school shit, even if it's not in high school... I can't wait to move out... I just hope that I can make it... I like my cat... Skitz... :)  she's crazy... I miss rob... I'm hungry... I can't eat anything, though... I have to save my appetite for tonight... My family is going out to eat to celebrate my graduation... I don't know who all is going, but a lot of the  people  who were supposed to be going  doesn't want to go because my dad is going... so I don't think my older sister and her boyfriend are going... along with some of my not so close relatives (i.e. my cousin Jennifer)... I think that is really fucked up.. they aren't supposed to be going to dinner for my dad, it's for me... so fuck my dad... he's paying for it too... why can't they just bite the bullet... I haven't been out with them in a long time and I will probably never go out with them ever again, and this is what they  want to do... well fuck them too...

I hate my family...

You're the epitome of insane. Either you're very smart, or you're too damn stupid. The world is your playground, and everything -- and everyone -- in it is a toy for you to play with. People should be scared of you, but because you're so affable, they aren't. Tough for them.

I thought it was kind of funny... :) Afterwards, Jenn, Jess, Anthony, and I watched <i>Sleepy Hollow</i> over at Jenn's house... I fell asleep... but it was okay, because I was beside Anthony... We all had French vanilla cappuccinos, but when I woke up... I was really sick... It was like they had cocoa in them (I'm allergic to cocoa)... it made me nausous and shakey... It was pretty bad... Oh yeah, and I want to thank you, Anthony, for staying at my house with me... :* ...

Today, I was blaring <i>Anthony's Mac</i> <sup>he he</sup> in the band hall... it was great... Lisa heard it and she wanted to borrow the cd... so I let her... she's going to give it back to me tomorrow, though <sup>thank god.</sup> Anthony is going to copy one of Jenn's VAST cds for me... <i>YAY!</i>... he he whelp, that's all I feel like writing at the moment...

<center>*****************************************</center>

"". . . I have been dating Mikey on and off for a year and 6 months . . . and it was and still is hell . . . (here's a little background. . . Mikey and my relationship started off pretty good . . .we were always together, and we were happy . . . that is, for 6 month's . . . after that, he started to get paranoid . . . he would always question me about what I did that day or who I talked to . . . stuff like that. . . it was like he didn't trust me . . . and he had no reason for that . . . well, 3 weeks before our 11 month anniversary, he started to hang around this one girl . . . I didn't think anything of it until that one day . . . on this particular day, he asked if Jeyn, the one girl he had been hanging around alot, himself, and I could have a three-some! This blew my mind . . . then when I told him no, he still insisted . . . finally he gave up, but came up with another question . . . he asked if he could have sex with her!! That ripped my heart out . . . my first and only one that I had ever loved wants someone else. . . after he asked me, I told him no . . . and he accepted that . . .but he still didn't stop asking . . . finally one day, our 11 month anniversary to be specific, he couldn't be found . . . he was supposed to go to one of his friends houses after he got off work and call me, but he never did . . . when I called that night, they said they hadn't seen nor heard from him . . . I called the next morning and they STILL had not heard from him . . . I was supposed to get a ride to a band rehearsal from him that morning . . . well, at the school I was marching in the field when Brandon, Mikey's friend whom he was supposed to stay with the night before, came up to me . . . he told me that he found out where Mikey was the night before . . . he had ended up going over to Jeyn's house . . . that upset me greatly, so I left . . . my ex-boyfriend just happened to be there so I got a ride from him to my friend Jenn's house (notice the different spellings between the names) . . . this was at about 11:30 that morning and I was there til about 5 o'clock that evening . . . well Mikey found me that day and he swore up and down that he only went to her house for 15 minutes . . . and I believed him . . . well, Mikey still did not stop with that question . . .  and then someone proposed me with the idea that he might do it anyways . . . and that  scared me . . . so I told Mikey that he could . . . big mistake . . .because I thought that he would see how much it was hurting me and decided not to, but I was wrong . . . the second I told him that, we both got up and went to her house . . . that night we arranged for the next day to skip band class and go to Jake's, one of my friends, house so they could blah blah . . . so that day the four of us went to Jake's house, and with no regret or even a second thought about it, they went into Jake's room and proceeded . . . the second the door shut, I ran out of the house . . . I couldn't take it . . . Jake tried to comfort me, but I wouldn't let him . . . after they were done, they came out of the room like nothing was wrong, and I wanted to die  . . . from that day forward, everything between Mikey and me was distorted.  About a month later exactly one week before our 1 year anniversary, we broke up.  During that time, he told me that there was only one person that he would choose over me, and that was someone who he had liked since 9th grade and who he knew he never had a chance with, Alexis.  That crushed me . . . the person whom I wanted to be with dispite what had happened would rather have someone else . . .on top of that he told me over and over again that it was my fault that he had sex with someone else . . . what a crock of bull shit!! . . . the next day, he told me that he had fallen back in love with his ex-girlfriend. . . I don't understand how he could tell me something like that . . .but he did . . . well, after all of this, he decided to get back with me . . . but I wasn't sure if I wanted to . . . so he told me that he would give me a month to think about it with out any influences from him . . . but he made me promise one thing, to not do anything sexual with anyone else during that time, and I made him promise the same . . . well, three weeks into the whole ""month"" ordeal, we got back together . . . it was about a week before Christmas by this  time . . . for Christmas I went to Hattiesburg to visit my father . . . I stayed up there for about 4 days.  During this time, Mikey called me . . . he told me that he had something to tell me, but he wouldn't tell me unless we were together, alone . . . so I got back home the day before Christmas, and I spent the next day with him . . . so now it is Christmas Day, and Mikey and I are alone . . . so he desides to tell me what he had to get off of his chest . . . he told me that on our 11th month anniversary when I couldn't find him, he was off having sex with Jeyn . . . now if that wasn't bad enough, he then told me that during that month we were separated, the one he and I promised to not do anything sexual with anyone, he had sex with his ex-girlfriend, NaNa . . . all of this shit came from a human being . . . I had no idea anyone could be so cruel . . . after he told me all this, I wanted to die . . . I had nothing and realized that I never did . . . so, a month later I was still with him . . . don't ask me why, but I was . . . that is up until he decided to drop me like a piece of meat for one of my only best friends . . . when this happened I thought for sure that Elizabeth  wouldn't do this to me . . . I REALLY did . . .  but she did . . . that is when I stopped assuming and decided that I really didn't know the people that I thought I knew . . . and I disconnected myself from everyone I knew, besides my bestest friend in the whole world, Jenn . . . A week later, I started going out with Jake . . . and I got bitched out for it by Mikey, which by that time I would think that he would realize that he had NO right to . . . Well, Jake and I were somewhat happy . . . besides the fact that he hardly ever called me, we were okay, and I liked him alot . . . that is until Mikey and Elizabeth broke up because she realized that she didn't like him as much as she thought she did, and she cheated on him, but shhh . .  . don't tell him that because he doesn't know . . . but anyways . . . Mikey decided to try and make me cheat on Jake . . . he tried asking me to kiss him and when that didn't work, he tried to hold me down and kiss me . . . and that didn't work either . . . Mikey said that that was the day he realized that he could trust me . . . a bit to late don't you think? . . . but after that Mikey decided that he wanted me to be happy, so he went to have a little talk with Jake . . . and that same day, Jake broke up with me . . . I don't exactly know why, but he did, and I know it has something to do with Mikey . . . but Mikey said that Jake said that he was already thinking about breaking up with me anyways . . . Jake told me that he broke up with me because I was unhappy . . . and I told him that if that was true then I guess it was pointless, because I was more unhappy without him than with him . . . but none the less we were broken up, and a week later he was going out with some one else, Holly.  Thus, Mikey and I got back together . . . how convenient for him) . . .""

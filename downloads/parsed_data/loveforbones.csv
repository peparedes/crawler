"event","scale this morning said 110.5! i thought it was going to say like, 114 at the least @_@ okie dokie... so my goal of 100lbs in 2 weeks seems a little more achievable : ) I can do this, i'm so happy...still feel terrible about the pills...but I think it's a small price to pay for perfection. When i'm ready, i'll go like...buy alot of things there and give a big tip or something? maybe that would make me feel better, anyway, I hope everyone is doing well."

"event","yea so basically my internet = poop!!! I guess there's a problem with the mother board or something.&nbsp; And it wont be getting fixed in a long time. I probably wont have internet until i go to college which is a little over a year. Which makes me very very sad. : (&nbsp; Well here's an update......
Went to Genesis and that was awesome!!! Too bad it was my last one.&nbsp; Then I went to Chicago for NHS.&nbsp; That was a lot of fun.&nbsp; I got stuck between a wall and a bed which pretty much ended in a rug burn on my side because Stephy had to drag me our by my feet. Yea it sucked!!&nbsp; Yesterday I talked to Jim from Reflections because I'm a rep for them and I guess I'm taking my pictures on the 17th.&nbsp; So that should be fun I guess.&nbsp; People are coming over to my house on Wednesday for a shindig. WOOT!!!&nbsp; Don't know who all is coming but it should be lots of fun.&nbsp; Considering that this one person is coming : ) and because stephy is spending the night and we're gonna watch fun fun movies.&nbsp; If everyone hasnt already figuired it out yeah i like someone.&nbsp; But im sure u guys can tell who it is.&nbsp; If you dont know ask Stephy or me. but remember i wont be online so ask steph if its online.&nbsp; So I got nothin else to say except for talk to you guys next century when my computer gets fixed!&nbsp;

"event","Hey all its the long lost brittany! yeah my internet decided it didnt want to work anymore.  We're going to try to get my brother to fix it when he comes home this weekend but im not getting my hopes up because we think its a hard drive problem which would really suck for me.  Im at Stephy's right now thats how im typing this. Im sure a lot of stuff has happened since i last typed to you all but I really cant remember anything.  So...just hope that i get the internet back cuz im sad without it. no jk. but i do like the internet. Love you all!  Britt"

"event","Im sorry if i have hurt u in any way. I dont mean to. If u think something bad about me then thats ur opinion i respect that but dont be surprised if u see a tear in my eye. I just want to say that not everything in life goes as planned and you cant just ignore the way life takes you. life takes you places sometimes it somewhere you might not expect. but in the end everything works out for itself. you may end up with different friends later on no matter how hard you try to hold onto them. but there are the select few that you will stay friends with for the rest of your life and i am truly greatful for them. i would be no where without them. so again i say to you..if i have ever done anything to you i didnt do it intentionally and i am truly sorry for any pain i have caused you. i just hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me. please look at me differently and try to see it from my perspective as well and if you still think the same way then by all means think it. im sorry for everything you know who you guys are.

<P>Fin'lly got over that song of ours; stopped chasin' little red sports cars, <BR>To check the license plates an' back wood drivin' by your place. <BR>Back makin' the rounds at our old haunts: Honky Tonks, restaurants. <BR>An' seein' some of our old friends: it feels good to dance again. <BR>An' I can fin'lly smell your perfume an' not look around the room for you. <BR>An' I can walk right by your picture in a frame an' not feel a thing. <BR><BR>But when I hear your name, <BR>I feel rain fallin' right out of the blue sky. <BR>An' it's the fifth of May, an' I'm right there starin' in your eyes. <BR>An' nothin's changed, an' we're still same. <BR>An' I get lost in the innocence of a first kiss, <BR>An' I'm hangin' on to every word rollin' off of your lips: <BR>An' that's all it takes, an' I'm in that place, <BR>Every time I hear your name. <BR><BR>Got someone special in my life: everyone thinks she'd make a great wife. <BR>Dad says he thinks she's the one: reminds him of Mom when she was young, <BR>But it's way too soon to be talkin 'bout rings; don't wanna rush into anything. <BR>She's getting over someone too, kinda like me an' you. <BR>An' she talks about him every once in a while, an' I just nod my head an' smile, <BR>'Cause I know exactly what she's goin' through: yeah, I've been there too. <BR><BR>An' when the conversation turns to you, <BR>I get caught in a ""you were the only one for me"", <BR>Kinda thought, an' your face is all that I see. <BR>I know I can't go back when I still go back. <BR>An' there we are, a point down by the riverside, <BR>An' I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time, <BR>An' that's all it takes, an' I'm in that place, <BR>Every time I hear your name. <BR><BR>So I'm thinkin' 'bout the words I left unsaid. <BR>(Every time I hear your name.) <BR>Stop tryin' the change the things I can't change. <BR>(Every time I hear your name.) <BR>In my heart I know you're gone, but in my head, <BR><BR>I feel rain fallin' right out of the blue sky. <BR>An' it's the fifth of May, an' I'm right there starin' in your eyes. <BR>That's all it takes, an' I'm in that place. <BR>An' there we are, a point down by the riverside, <BR>An' I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time. <BR>An' I can't explain, but I'm in that place, <BR>Every time I hear your name. <BR>Every time I hear your name. <BR>(Every time I hear your name.) <BR>Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. <BR>(Every time I hear your name.) <BR>Ah ah. <BR>Every time I hear your name.</P>

<P>That was the exciting news i got on sunday. Sarah called us after it happened. It's pretty exciting.&nbsp;They're thinking probably an August wedding. I think they're making an announcement on saturday at the lockin. But they told me i didnt have to keep it a secret.&nbsp;I just couldnt tell katie, my grandma or nick armstrong because they wanted to tell them theirselves. We talked about it after they got home yesterday for like 2 hours. its pretty exciting. I'm gonna be a bridesmaid...at least thats what she told me yesterday. So we're all pretty excited! Thats all i got for today.</P>

I was freakin out the whole time!! my heart was beating so fast it was crazy. aww man it was nuts. the whole crowd ran out onto the field and bombarded our boys. Matthew went in at halftime. i was surprised julie let him go in but to tell you the truth we probably woulda lost without him. danny reyes really pulled through for us too. matt got to play to i was excited i cheered real loud for him. steven played real good today too. well i was really pumped at the game today and i'm so happy we won. our next challenge... OV vs Grayling @ home. be there or else!!!!!!

Saturday~ Woke up. went shopping with matthew and less for mel's present. came home matt called and then he came over til 7. at 7 i went to mel's party. then went to the haunt with people at church. In my group it was me, matt, kari, and nick. it was a lot of fun. on the way there i was trying to sleep but they were telling stories so i listened. then on the way home i slept though. : ) then lessa came and spent the night!

Sunday~ went to church. jon wouldnt quit messin with me all service. that big poop. then came home and ate lunch. then went back to church for youth group. the meeting was fear not (it was my meeting).  it was sooo scary. the guy was pickin on me all night. he put the trantula in my face. i cried and ran away. then during the meeting he sat next to me with the boa constricter thats like 8 feet long. i was sooooo scared at that too. i was trying to hide behind matt and he put the head on my shoulder and i flipped. matt thought i was kidding but i was seriously terrified. finally matt switched with me. : ) then came home and did nothing

Monday~ school. came home and watched some tv. then went trick or treating with audie ann and summer. summer was a pain in the butt. but me and audie had fun. got lots of good candy. then did nothin after that.

today~ callin matt in a bit to see when im going over there. and im going shoppin with my mom today because there are some really good sales at penney's and kohl's. and i dont know what else im doin. prolly nothin.

"event","Well the game was really good! we were trailin at half time but came back up in the second half. The colorguard (minus Magan) were pissin me off!!!! but its all good now. We won 40-29(i think). Then the band went on to WZZM to do 13 on you sidelines. I got home at 1:30 am. i was so frikken tired. Matthew got hurt last night and it was really sad. : ( he hyperextended his elbow and then they took him to get x-rays to see if it was broken. i guess i will find out today what happened with him when me and less go shoppin and stuff. i hope he's ok. Well i gotta go take a shower and eat breakfast so i can spend most of my day with the lovely Alyssa Lea Peterson!!! <3 that girl!!

"event","Well today i feel like crap. I didnt think my voice could get any worse but guess what it did. Lessa called me yesterday and she could hardly understand me. Now today I cant do anything but whisper and then you can hardly hear what i say. it totally sucks. i hope i dont get anyone else sick.
Well on a different note...
Our meeting for youth group next week is gonna be sweet!!! I'm excited. we had some fun up in the ceiling planning it. right nick and age. i swear nick is the scariest person in the world. The sercant leader retreat was cancelled and we moved it to december 2 and 3  and then we're staying in lessa's grandparents cottage on wolf lake. it should be fun. they kinda had to move it to be after football season considering a lot of our boys are ov varsity football players. so now that that is cancelled i can spend time with my lessa! : ) We'll see what happens this weekend.

"event","Soooo I havent updated about my life in over a week so i thought id do that.
Last Sunday~ youth group 
Monday~ The Last Monday Night Rehearsal of the year! pretty excited about that being over with! It actually went by quite fast if i do say so myself.
Tuesday~Last Colorguard practice of the year! it was pretty fun. We had our last test and it was the whole frikken song!!!!! we did it in pairs. I got 200 points out of 200. i was sooo flippin happy with myself.
Wednesday~ MSBOA marching competition. we got a 2 and i was pretty pleased with that considering i think thats what we deserved. colorguard did really good too. and jack brought us hot cocoas because it was freezing. matt came and watched me &hearts;. although kevin and matthew were calling him whipped for coming. which was stupid cuz i know matthew hates being called whipped too. i wish the boys would just stop being so stupid and not call anyone whipped. oh and i dyed my hair! it looks great! i love it!
thursday~ went to matt's game. they lost but thats ok. luke scored a touchdown and i clapped for him and people looked at me wierd. who cares if he's on the other team...he's my friend. talked to less for a minute before the game. 
friday~ pep assembly was funny. then came back for band at 5. then had a frikken awesome game against oakridge. we won 20-14. that game was soooooo close it wasnt even funny!i had a lot of fun!!!!! but i was starting to get sick.
saturday~ Last day of the regular marching season! Jenison comp. had to be at school at 7 in the flippin morning. we didnt even do much. colorguard got 5th out of 8 and the band and drumline took 8th. our score was 73.9 or something like that. although merchant thought we deserved a lot better than that and i think i agree. then after that went to sarah's parents house for a little bit and then came home. i called matt and he came over and then we went to kyle's house for a bonfire. it was pretty fun. me and matt only stayed for a couple hours cuz it was pretty cold. then we came back to my house and watched the interpreter. it was pretty good. then matt went home and i went to bed cuz all day i felt like crap i was loosing my voice.
today~ woke up and i couldnt talk. went to church anyway and got jamie to do the little lambs room for me because i couldnt talk. everyone was making fun of me. in sunday school i had to whisper to age or matt what i wanted to say and they would say it for me. : ( it was sad. i still cant talk very well. for lunch my mom is making steak and potatoes for my daddy's bday yesterday. im excited! i love steak and potatoes! then at 4 im going to the servant leader meeting and then youth group. Stephy just got her dog and i cant wait to see her! im gonna love Inga with my life ive decided. alright well lunch is almost done!

"event","<P>so adam's entry got me thinkin....if you wanna know more read the cut....</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Capture The Moment""> </P>
<P>""know that in 7-8 years i will not even have the faintest idea as to what these people are doing. i worry about that quite a bit "" that quote from adams journal is what got me thinkin. </P>
<P>Here we are complaining about school and stuff everyday. "" aww i gotta go to school"""" aww i got practice"" we complain so much we fail to realize all the memories we could be making in just that one day. We need to cherish every moment that we have with our friends in high school because more than likely you wont be friends with a lot of those people after high school. You'll all go to different colleges and slowly lose contact. At every moment of the day you're making a memory. So next time you complain about going somewhere or doing something just think about the things that could happen that are great. The greatest memories come from things unplanned.&nbsp; Just hanging out with a few close friends just watching a movie and talking can mean so much. Every little thing like that with your friends is something special and you'll remember that when you're older.</P>
<P>So the point of this entry was.... Never take for granted the times you have with your friends because they're special. Love a lot. Laugh until your stomach hurts. Take walks on the beach. Stay home on the weekend and&nbsp; watch a movie with the girls. Be crazy. &nbsp;Sing your heart out once in a while. When you're in love shout it to the world. Be yourself. Never let anyone change you. Pour your heart into everything you do. And Most of all take every moment of your life and put in your heart and let it stay!!!</P>
<P>&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 Britt</P>

"event","So the concert was a lot of fun!!!!! My favorite band the whole night was Audio Adrenaline! it was awesome! I hung out with Megan almost the whole time and other people. Here's everyone that went...Me, Nate, Katie, Luke, Age, Nick, Stephy, Jamie, Ryry, Megan, Steve, Tarte, Erica, Joshie, Dowdy, Anna, and Everett. It was a pretty sweet group. Superchic[k] was cool too. Oh and American Accents they were a really sweet band...my favorite song of theirs was dairy queen i really want that song!

I learned some new things last night...
* Nick Scott is the smartest person in the world lol.
* Stephy and Anna can get really close to the front and can stand for a really long    time.
* Me and nick scott could quite possibly be the slickest people in the universe.
* Luke and age are really cute..oh wait i already knew that!
* Megan gets car sick and nothin helps her

Other than that today has been an overall good day! School went fine although matt and jon called me ugly : ( they were just kidding though. The Football game was of course awesome. The band did really good at halftime and it made me really happy! I also got to see my beautiful Alyssa Peterson for a brief moment. gosh i miss her being here. im glad i got to see her. But i didnt get to see matt at my break and that was sad. and he's going duck hunting tomorrow and im going to a concert so therefore i wont talk to him tomorrow either. But the game was fun...me and jess had a lot of fun and i sorted some things out with erica which was good.

<P>&nbsp; A woman was asked by a coworker, ""What is it like to be a Christian?""</P>
<P>&nbsp; The coworker replied, ""It is like being a pumpkin.""&nbsp; God picks you from the patch, brings you in, and washes all the dirt off of you.&nbsp; Then He cuts off the top and scoops out all the yucky stuff.</P>
<P>&nbsp; He removes the seeds of doubt, hate, and greed.&nbsp; Then He carves you a new smiling face and puts His light inside of you to shine for all the world to see.""</P>
<P>&nbsp; This was passed on to me by another pumpkin.&nbsp; Now it's your turn to pass it to other pumpkins.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I got this from my momma in an email! i like pumpkins and im making a snow white one this year : )!!!! </P>

<P>so band totally sucked today! i was soo mad today and cranky. it was inside rehearsal today so therefore colorguard was outside. it made me kinda mad that we didnt do crap. well i practiced most of the time but we got absolutely nothing accomplished. i did colorguard because i thought it would be different from cheerleading..well it is. </P>
<P>Cheerleading~ organized mostly but a lot of drama&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>Colorguard~ not a lot of drama but not a lot of organization</P>
<P>I just dont know which one is better or worse. i cant decide. well hopefully ill figuire it out. but right now band makes me really really really angry and i dont want to be in it at this moment. we'll see what i do at the end of the school year. i'll prolly just stay in it because it'll be my senior year but right now i just cant stand it!</P>

People with documents in their hands look like hardworking employees heading for important meetings. People with nothing in their hands look like they're heading for the cafeteria. People with the newspaper in their hands look like they're heading for the bathroom. Above all, make sure you carry loads of stuff home with you at night, thus generating the false impression that you work longer hours than you do."

To the girl with the mousy hair

And her daddy has told her to go

Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools

I came down with the flu or something on Monday.  Got home and went to sleep at 5:30PM and didn't get up until 6PM the next day!!  I feel much better now...I felt like I was going to die before.  Work sucks for many reasons...I will only name a few.  First, I'm working in ad sales (sooooo boring).  Second, I have no human interaction all day (I sit in a cubicle and no one seems to come to work) Third, I've seen one of my bosses for all of 5 minutes in the last week, and my other boss can't figure out how to work her computer or drive around LA.  So I'm stuck acting as IT support and her concierge.  She's a total wacko!  Everything is always ""bad karma"" with her.  That's pretty much it in a nutshell.  Believe me, I could go on forever, but I won't bore you with any more of it.  Hopefully, they will hire someone quick and I will be outta here in 2-3 weeks.  Any more than that and I'm quitting!"

The Grizzly Rose is slightly better...if there is such a thing.  Anyways, I had a good old time making fun of everyone line dancing with their mullets and white cowboy boots.  Seriously, white cowboy boots!?! Come on people, what's up with that?  The best part was the $1 shots. What other bar offers $1 shots...fucking amazing!!  oh, and $2 Cuervo shots.  I thought that by moving to LA I could avoid places like this, but I guess I was wrong.  All in all, the evening was fun and I had a good time.  I don't think I will be going back to Cowboy Country anytime soon, but at least I can say I have been."

"event","First of all, in the words of Wyclef Jean ""THANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY.""

So we received a letter from out apartment management company about a month ago, saying that they were giving us a 60-day notice that they were filing with the city of LA to convert our building into apartments...meaning they would be owned instead of rented.  No big deal...right? If that even happens, so I hear, it takes at least a year for them to go through all the motions.  However, we received another letter yesterday with lots of confusing legal jargon that I could barely understand.  What I think I understand from the letter is that we are being kicked out and the management company will provide us with any help to find a new aparment.  First of all, BFD...oh, that is ever so helpful you fuckers!  Second, I'm not sure what to think because I didn't really understand the aforementioned document anyhow.  So, I guess, no need to panick right now, but it sounds like we might have to move.  I will not be very happy if this is the case.

The other thing is that our kitchen floor is leaking....yes, leaking!  There is water seeping up through the tile grout.  We have put at least 8-10 calls into the management company and they have yet to fix anything.  WHAT THE FUCK!?!  I'm sure the flooding of my roommates bathroom is no big deal either.  I love how people return my phone calls.  DON'T YOU KNOW WHO I AM!?!  I'm someone important...or at least, someday I will be.  Dammit people, get on the ball...my apartment is falling apart.  If anyone is reading this in Los Angeles, NEVER EVER, EVER rent from the Beaumont Company."

A couple red bulls and coffees later, I'm not that tired...but I know that I will have absolutely no problem going to sleep tonight.  It's very strange to drive down Wilshire Blvd. and be the only car on the road...I was having a Vanilla Sky moment this morning.  This morning (nomination announcements) was totally exciting and now the day has just hit a very quiet/boring plateau.  Not much to do and the phones have stopped ringing.  I received some very interesting phone calls today.  Like, ""how come Passion of the Christ wasn't nominated?  Are you some kind of idiot for not nominating it!?!"" Or ""it must be some kind political conspiracy that Fahrenheit 9/11 wasn't nominated!! The truth shall always prevail and one day films like this will come forward to speak the truth!!""  Of course, I can't voice my opinion so I sit on the phone and let them berate me about Christianity/Jesus and how box office sales should automatically nominate a film...ha!  DO I SOUND LIKE I CARE!?! NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT!!  There are seriously a bunch of fuckin' whack jobs out there.  The highlight of my day...watching Adrien Brody fix his hair before he went on stage (it's official...I'm in love)  The other highlight...a publicist I once interviewed with (the one that ripped her assistant a new one in front of me) was talking to me today and had no remembrance of me whatsoever.  Dammit, Rachel that is so wrong!!  Yo Blair...why she gotta be so self-absorbed?  Only 3 more hours of work to go...I'm pretty loopy right now...I'm going to go drink more coffee.

I hope LA didn't scare you away too much:)  Don't count on me coming back to Colorado any time soon...it's way too cold there for me.  I don't think I could handle it.  The chair I'm sitting in right now could be the most uncomfortable chair in the world and it's destroying whatever is left of my bad posture.    I went to the Aquarium of the Pacific this last weekend and I got to pet a shark (definitely a big highlight of my time here in LA so far)  It's been raining cats and dogs here for the last week and I'm starting to get sick of it.  The rain beating against my window wakes me up at 4am every single morning.  I went to sleep at 9:30 last night and even after fifty-eleven-hundred hours of sleep I'm still exhausted.  Well, I better get back to looking like I do something around here."

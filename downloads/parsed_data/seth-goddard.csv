"event","That took much longer than it should have.  I was trying to take this test, but Harlan was pulling his Daredevil stunt again, and Rosie sent him to the medbay with third degree burns seven consecutive times.  Distractions and all, here is my test.

<lj-cut text=""Here it is."">

01. What time is it: 01:31

02. Name: Seth Goddard

03. Name as it appears on birth certificate: Seth Miles Goddard.  I've gotten over it...

04. Nickname: We aren't going to talk about that.

05. Number of candles on your last birthday cake: Forty-five... or at least, that's what I told them.  

06. Pets: I have to take care of five kids and T.J. Davenport; do you think I have time for a cat?

07. Natural Hair color/texture: Brown.

08. Body Piercing: That takes me back...

09. Eye color: Blue.

10. Birth Place: Montreal, Quebec; Earth.

11. Current Residence: The Lumanian starship Christa.

12. Favorite food: I'm not picky, really.

13 Ever been to Africa: Well, technically, no.  I was stationed above it for about a year on a monitoring station back when I first got out of the Academy; a small stint in security ops before I went to command school.  I never got to set foot on land, but the reconstruction work seemed to be coming along nicely.  

14. Been toilet papering: You'd be surprised how hard it is to T.P. someone's room after the auxiliary power has gone out, leaving you in 0g gravity.  (This also takes me back...)

15. Love someone so much it made you cry: Well yes, but that's because I was physically wounded at the time.

16. Been in a car accident: Yes.  Do they really have to hover?  Spacecraft I can understand having anti-grav hover as a supplement to their landing gear, but you're only a meter or so from the ground in those things!  It's completely superfluous!

17. Croutons or bacon bits: Bacon Bits... and this is why T.J. and I can never be.

19. Favorite day of the week: N/A.

20. Favorite word or phrase: the ""space hates"" lines rule over all they survey.  

21. Favorite restaurant: There's this little, hole-in-the-wall Russian restaurant on Io that I found a few years ago.  The manager's name is even Dimitri... easily the best place I've ever been to.

22. Favorite flower: N/A

23. Favorite sport to play/watch: I played Risk when I was a kid...  Why have a sport when you can command a ship?

24. Favorite drink: Autumn in Ganymede... created it myself.

25. Favorite ice cream flavor: Ginger.  

26. Favorite fast food restaurant: N/A

27. What color is your bedroom carpet: I have a couple grounding carpets next to the door and my bed that are a dark red, but the floors are the standard grey linoleum insulator stripping.

28. How many times did you fail your drivers test: It was kind of funny, actually; out of all of the testing, I failed my basic driver's test twice, but was able to drive a 380 ton freight transport with faulty brakes just fine.  I have up to a class C driver's license, and a fifth level personal spacecraft endorsement, so I had to take quite a few tests.  

29. Besides this one, from whom did you get your last e-mail? T.J. kept mailing me about something.  After a while I just started to delete them all...

30. Which store would you choose to max out your credit card:  N/A.

31. What do you do most often when you are bored:  I used to tinker around with the ship a lot, but I kind of learned my lesson after the Christa put me in traction for three months.  

32. Most annoying thing people ask/tell me: ""You wanted <i>me</i> to do that?""

33. What time do you go to bed: I usually head to my quarters for the night at about 21:30, but I stay up until one or two o'clock reading.  

34. Who will respond to this the quickest: No one... I think everyone else has filled it out already.

35. Who is the person you sent this to that is least likely to respond: Harlan, who doesn't even have a livejournal.

36. Favorite TV show: Never really watched television, even back home.

37. Last person you went out to dinner with: Apparently (according to her livejournal, at least) the last person I went out to dinner with was Ms. Davenport.  However, around supper time that night I was busy trying to re-route some wiring and the gizbot rolled up with a couple of snacks, and a picture of Ms. Davenport taped to its front panel.  If that's what you want to interpret as going out to dinner with someone, I suppose it's true.  

38. Ford or Chevy: I've only seen pictures of either.

39. Tattoos: One, but I keep it covered.

40. Favorite place to visit: I like to be in the command post when the kids have left and it's nice and quiet.  Generally speaking, I like going to places I've never been... It's the sense of adventure in me, I guess.

41. Where would you live if you could move right now: Home, most likely.  

42. Where would you go if you had a free, round-trip airline ticket: I've never been very interested in planet-bound travel.  I figure, why bother if you can travel from planet to planet?

43. Favorite school subject:  I always loved history as a kid.   

44. What is the weather like right now? If I were on a planet I would be happy to tell you.

45. Fondest Elementary School Memory: My first fight always struck me as kind of nostalgic, because it was with my first crush.

46. Fondest High School Memory: Graduation... 

47. Fondest College Memory: I didn't get a college education; I went to military school.

48. Last movie you saw: Dr. Strangelove.  It's a crime that now days people don't know who Stanley Kubrick is.

49. What book are you reading? ""Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes"" by Oolon Colluphid.

50. Worst drunken moment: That time all my crew-mates and I sang the Quebec national anthem...

51. Best drunken moment: That time all my crew-mates and I sang the Quebec national anthem.

52. Worst teacher: Any of the ""For Dummies"" books.

53. What's the worst reason to break up with someone?  Bad sexual relationship.  

54. The Best: The significant other isn't willing to compromise.  

55: Best Vacation: There was this one planet leave on Miranda...  well, the statutes aren't out on some of the activities I engaged in there, so I should probably refrain from telling you about the full trip. ;-)

56. Worst Vacation: To be brutally honest, but I would never recommend going to Mars colony... most uppity, snobbish place on the native side of the asteroid belt. (nothing personal, Ms. Davenport...)

57. Time you finished this e-mail: 22:43.


I figured it might be a little more fun if I did this backwards; do all the standard eye colour/shoe size kind of questions at the end.

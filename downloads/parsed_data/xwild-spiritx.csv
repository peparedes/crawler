I would like to make some things known, because Im sure at some point these things will come into play


 1. I atleast give everyone sometime to know me alittle better and for me to know them, but if we reach a point where we're just not hitting it off/ clicking or Im just not feeling it-- I will remove you , please remember that its nothing personal!  I simply don't want just a list of names, I want a list of FRIENDS......... I don't think thats too much to ask for 

2.  If I don't add you back right away, its because Im not going to, again its nothing personal, its mostly likely a compatibility issue/nothing in common issue...... nothing more

3. Don't be a dick to the people on my friends list, there are several people Iam fond of .......I would react aggressively should you be rude to any of them

4. Oh and this probably goes with out saying BUT, If you never comment (or very rarely comment) I will assume that you do not read this journal, have very little interest in its contents or you do not  wish to interact with me. A lack of commenting, will result in your removal.  I don't expect comments constantly, but its nice to know every once and awhile that someones on the other end reading your crap.



----------This is what you can expect from me---------

I rarely talk about my life, I post alot of questions to get conversations going , I post alot of stories or memories from long ago, or I post about what's on my mind

I do not post surveys or memes, the surveys I do post on occasion are blank ones that I write , for the people on my friends list to take

I do not leave comments unless I feel the need to , I will not post comments on , for example new hair cut posts

I do not cause drama or pick fights (I only fight the ones that are worth fighting, I leave the petty and ridiculous alone)

I will always repsect your viewpoints as long as you respect mine

I do NOT take myself all that seriously and really, neither should you!



-------- Don't add me if any of these apply to you--------

You are in love with yourself

You constantly make a friends-cut posts in your journal (if you want to cut me, simply do it! I will not beg to stay)

you want bodies instead of actual connections - just adding random people just for the sake of adding them makes you look like a neurotic douchebag

you post 50 million different pictures of yourself from a thousand and one angles, sure I like pictures, but if you CONSTANTLY post pictures of yourself, I will assume you are full of yourself, sorry ....but I call it like I see it

U Talk lyke dys or use netspeak,because half of the time I have no idea what the hell your talking about not only that, but Im an old, I have limited time on this earth and I can't spend it decoding your journal entries

your intentionally rude, I don't mean rude as in you tell the truth and nothing, but the truth so help you god, I mean you go out of your way to be a dick

you expect alot of comments or journal entries

your cool, I don't have time for self important, pompous,trendy arrogant ,spoiled little shitheads so smell my ass or go fornicate yourself.. one or the other... whatever works for me or prehaps you could do both! 

You write alot about your boyfriend or girlfriend(sorry but your journal is suppose to be about you! How can I ever learn anything, if all you do is chatter on about your S.O)

You recount every annoying little detail of your day( sorry, Im not interested in those types of journals- again
how can I LEARN anythning if all you ever post about is waking up and having a bowl of cheerios?)

You write about your many sexual encounters(and before anyone ask, Yes! Im a really big prude, with an even bigger stick wedged up my backside!)

You do not have a good sense of humor 

You're a snob"

Then we're going to get 2 houses and put on each 4 acres and i'm going to have my own house.  I'm <b>SO</b> excited, I can not wait.  I'm still going to buy a horse for myself and my nephew.  

Nothing much has been going on...except work.  The guy that emailed me, wanting to get to know me more.  He would call me and leave a message, and when I try and call him back I get his voice mail.  It's like playing phone tag.  Maybe one day we'll get a hold of one another.  

Besides my job, I got a part time job...and I can not stand the people.  I work my ass off...sweating...and all the other workers stand around or sit and talk.  I wish I could get paid to do that.  But all the jobs i've had...I <b>always</b> ""worked hard for the money""! *LOL*

Off to make dinner.  Have a good night"

"event","Happy Easter!!

I thought I had found the perfect house I wanted, but I found something much better.  Instead of almost 6 acres, I found something with 8 acres.  So much better.  I'm seriously thinking about getting it.  I've always wanted a horse, so if I get the place with 8 acres I will have plenty of property for my babies and have room for a horse.  Does anyone have any suggestions for a first time buyer...if you know anything about horses?  I've been searching the web and can't find any info on horses.  I'm seriously interested in an Appaloosa.  I saw a few <b>very</b> beautiful Appaloosas.  Are females called geldings?  *LOL* I'm not stupid, it's just new to me.  

Hope you all have a safe, but fun Easter :)"

I don't want to get my hopes up, because after quite a few bad blind dates/boyfriends...i'm hesitant.  There were two things in his email that really got to me.  First of all, he asked if I knew of any horses near where I live that ""you/we can ride"", and he said that he's going to keep his schedule free to meet me.  *LOL* It was really sweet, but i'm trying not to fall for it.

The last time we were there was a couple years ago.  When we get there we're going to stay a couple days in each town.  I think it will be so nice.  

We also decided that this December we're going to go to California Adventure and Marine World...or Sea World, whichever one is down south.  I've never been there, but have always wanted to go.  Not last year but the year before my mom and I took my nephew to Disneyland in December...which he has never been there, and we had a great time.  I can't believe how crazy people get there.

"event","<font face=""Tahoma""><font color=""turquoise"">This morning my mom came over and I was in the other room and guess who shows up?  My so-called brother.  Ever since high school I don't consider him my brother.  You may think i'm mean or whatever...but no one knows what i've been through.  Anyways...my mom went out to make him leave.  He is not allowed to come around  here or my parents house.  My nephew...his son lives with my parents.  My mom has been raising him since he was about 1 or 2 yrs old.  My brother has been using drugs and drinking ever since high school and when he gets angry he goes out of control.

I heard both of them yelling at each other, so I went out and told him to get the ""bleep"" out of here.  I noticed that he was pushing the gate against my mom and yelling at her and when I came out and told him to leave...he said that he's going to kill me.  It hasn't been the first time he has ever said that.  He has done things to me since high school...nothing surprises me.  He finally left, and my mom told me that he hit her knee with the gate, scratched her wrist with the gate, pushing his finger against her glasses (of course while wearing them) and he got right up in her face and told her that he wants Jonathan.  My mom told him that he's in school and she had to tell him that 3 or 4 times and he told her that he's going to kill her as well...and here's the dusey...that she's going to jail.  I <b>DO NOT</b> know what he's on, but I seriously got pissed.  I'm glad he left after I came out, I was about to go kick his ass...and i'm not afraid of him.  I've put up with his crap for many years and this has  been going on just as long...it seems like.  I'm still waiting for him to come back.  I'm glad I have 4 dogs, and I wonder if any of them would bite the shit out of him.  Hmmm...I wouldn't let them do that.  If he ever done anything to one of my babies, I would seriously have to kick his ass!!

I'm going to go try and cool down.  Besides me being hot after what happened...it's way too hot here"

Sara...my pregnant co-worker, she was in a bitchy mood those two days and this morning she was in a bad mood.  I <b>hate</b> working with people that way, so every chance I got I tried to change her mood.  I don't know if it was because our boss got to work this afternoon or what...but she eventually started talking to me again.  For some reason she quit talking to me and I didn't do anything to her.  A couple of people at work said it could be because of her hormones...who knows?

There's a guy at work that has been kind of smiling at me.  The last couple of weeks it has been reminding me of Patrick.  I'm being kind of hesitant...but on the other hand I don't want to be.  But i'm afraid that it will turn out just like it did with Patrick.  He is so handsome...nevermind *LOL* Last night my mom and I went to work and he was there.  We were walking around and my mom had told me that he sure was eye balling me.  Today every chance I got I would glance his way and I would catch him looking my way.  I'm not sure if he was, because I don't want to make it so obvious that i'm staring at him...but it looked like he was looking my way every time he walked by where I was.  I've also noticed that he also acts kind of shy.

They knew each other about 5 years before they started dating and she went on to tell me that the ex-girlfriend that was dating her boyfriend is still in love with him.  Leslie...my co-worker...she told me that she knows so many people in this town and in December last year someone emailed her the ex-girlfriend's phone number.  Leslie recently found it and decided to call her when she thought it was the right time.  I'm standing there listening to all this and trying to figure out if i'm a therapist??  I don't mind listening and trying to help other's with their problems...but when I have problems or things I want to talk about...do you think anyone is there for <b>me</b>??  <b>NO</b>!!  

Recently a friend of Leslie's told her that they saw her boyfriend near where he works with his ex.  They also said they saw her boyfriend somewhere else in town with his ex.  Leslie decided to call his ex and tell her that they are now living together and before she can finish what she was saying, his ex hung up on her.  Leslie decided to call her boyfriend and he was telling her that he never done anything...that they are just friends.  He asked her if it was alright that they are friends.  Leslie said no...you can't be friends with someone that you used to sleep with.  

Most of the day she was on the phone calling her boyfriend and leaving him messages...giving him ultimatums.  He wouldn't answer the phone until an hour and a half when she would be off work.  But she felt better when she got off work.  It could be from me listening to her and giving her my advice...or she felt better after all the calling his ex and calling him telling him off.  What do you think?  Do you agree that you can't be friends with someone you used to sleep with?  After listening to her I was thinking how much I miss talking with certain people.  Made me think about a lot of things *sigh*"

"event","The past couple of weeks i've had so many thoughts run through my head...wish I had time to jot them down.  

I've been really busy with work and it's been hard to work with my new tattoo...actually it <b>was</b> hard to work.  I couldn't put my left arm down next to my side without it throbbing with so much pain...it was almost impossible to handle.  It hurt to lift anything, but unfortunately I had to since no one I work with actually wants to work.  I get so irritated when I actually do more work than my manager...now that's pathetic!!  

This girl I work with...Sara...she's about 4 months pregnant.  It's actually nice to work with her so I can hear about what's going on with her baby...with all the kicking and moving and changing positions from from head being up and yesterday she told me that the baby must have done a complete circle because now the baby's head is aimed down.  She has told me a few times that it feels like there's an alien inside her.  Sometimes when i'm listening to her describe what's going on, I can't help but get a little jealous.  She's about 22 and i'm 30.  I don't understand why I haven't found Mr. Right and all my friend's and now a co-worker has babies.  I'm not a dog!  I get looked at a lot...I get smiled at and I smile back.  Maybe my time hasn't come yet.  My mom has told me that I should just be patient and it will happen.  I just don't want to be too old before I have a baby.  Every day when I hear about Sara's baby I get more and more anxious.  My time will come...eventually! *crosses fingers*

I'm off to bed...so I can snuggle under my blankets and listen to the rain outside my window.  That will be close as I will get to heaven...at the moment.  I just love it!

Good Night and Sweetdreams!  Take care <font size=""+4""><font color=""red"">&hearts;</font>"

I think it's going to be beautiful.  I'm getting it done this coming Friday the 12.  I'm at at work...as usual and I was getting very bored.  I don't have that much long here.

"event","I had a very nice conversation with a great friend. You know who you are. Actually we had our conversation hours ago, but i'm still unable to fall asleep. So I decided to watch the Montel show I recorded while I was at work. Sylvia Browne...who is a psychic. I think she's great and my mom also loves her. Anyways...I was watching the show and a lot of people were talking about their relatives that have passed aways. I don't know why but I started getting upset and for some reason I started thinking about the day when I will pass away. I got scared and started crying, and then I thought about my grandparents that have passed away a few years ago. The last few days I have thought about how much I miss them and wish they were here. I'm actually afraid of dieing. I hope that i'll have kids before the time comes. I just wanted to get that off my chest before I try and go to sleep. I'm still actually a little upset. Wish I had someone to cuddle and hold me tight while I cry myself to sleep. Atleast I have my babies who sleep with me...but that's not the same. Good Night and sweetdreams! I will read everyone's journal and try and comment later today/tonight or Friday. Take care, and love you all!!

During the morning/afternoon before I have to go to work i'm so tired I don't feel like doing anything except sleep.  I think I need a very long vacation...I wish.  I will read everyone's journal when I get a chance.  I had a question though.  There's a song that i've been waiting to get but can't find it anywhere!  Brooke Hogan is the singer and the song is called ""Daddy's little girl"", I believe.  If anyone could tell me where I could download it for my mp3 player, I would love you forever!!  I'm off to bed finally...had a <b>long</b> afternoon/evening.

"event","<font style=""livingstone"">I don't have much to say...but there's not much to do before heading off to bed.  I'm extremely bored...no one to talk to.  Or should I say can't find someone to have an actual conversation with.  Where do you all find nice people to talk with?  Maybe i'm looking in the wrong places.

The past week or so it's been raining and I absolutely love it!  When i'm outside walking my dogs I just love to stand there with my face up in the air, having the rain fall on my face.  I also love opening the door and stepping out onto the porch while it's raining and having the fresh air hitting my face.  I have to say that's the best smell i've ever smelled.  Some people think i'm crazy that I love rain so much.  I don't know why...it's something that i've loved for as long as I can remember.  

Anyways...if there's anything that any of you would like to know about me.  Feel free to ask.  I've been reading everyone's journal, and it would be nice for us all to get to know one another better.  Maybe every once in a while we can each post a question in our entries so other's may answer, in hopes of getting to know one another.  Good idea?  Stupid?  <b>I</b> would like to make good friends.  I hope all of you are.

I've been thinking about changing my background picture...again.  Can't decide what it should be.  Does anyone have a good idea?  Would love to hear the different thoughts.

Well, i'm off to bed to read a book.  Maybe that will help me fall asleep.  Hope everyone is doing good.  Take care :)

Today I have decided that i'm giving up on Patrick.  I hate to think that, but it's the right thing to do.  From what i've seen...how he acts, etc.  A couple people and my mom have all told me that he's just playing games.  I definately <b>do not</b> need a man in my life that acts like a child...or a boy.  I want a real man that can come out and tell me or show me that he's interested, except playing games like he does.  Patrick isn't my soulmate, and I just have to keep telling myself that ""the one"" is out there somewhere.  I just have to be patient."

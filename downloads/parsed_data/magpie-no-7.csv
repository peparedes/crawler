"event","I have a new blog. Or rather, I have <em><strong><u>a</u></strong></em> blog - as I don't think I've ever referred to this as one in the past. This, for me, has always been thought of as a journal - something that's private and on-the-whole unread by my closest peers (with a few exceptions - you know who you are). <br /><br />Anyway, I've recently had the urge to start writing again. And, given that I lose faith in my ideas for fiction VERY quickly, I felt a blog was the best way to get myself writing regularly. <br /><br />It has occurred to me that I could just continue to use this, but I fancy a change. I also like the idea of going public and leaving out the really personal stuff. No-one wants to read about my lack of a love-life, least of all me. A lot of my previous entries here are cringeworthy now, and I could do without my friends trawling back through the archives and discovering what a fool I was. And so, for that reason, I'm moving away from LiveJournal. Seeing as though this is only the second thing I've posted in the space of a year, I doubt I'll be missed all that much. And besides, I'm not deleting myself, so I may well reappear here from time to time. <br /><br />Please, to those of you that are still here, don't take this as a snub. And please don't think I'm ashamed of the past six-and-a-half years. I'm really not - I just think I could've written it better. <br /><br />I hope that anyone that does read this will join me&nbsp;at my new pad, even if it does mean the chore of adding an extra page to your favourites list. It would, I can assure you, be most appreciated.<br /><br />Here's hoping that this hasn't come across as anything too... <em>final</em>.&nbsp; I'll still be keeping my eye on you all, and as I previously said, I doubt this will be the last you see of me.<br /><br />For those that are interested, I can now be found <a href=""http://no-second-draft.blogspot.com/"">here</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />(How was that?&nbsp; 'cause I hate goodbyes.)"

"event","It's been nearly a year since I've written in this thing. I still keep up-to-date with other people's entries on a regular basis, but otherwise LiveJournal and I have seemingly drifted apart. Personally, I blame Facebook. <br /><br />For some reason, however, I felt compelled to steal this meme from&nbsp;<div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://lydialicious.livejournal.com/profile""><img style=""BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 1px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px"" height=""17"" alt=""[info]"" width=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://lydialicious.livejournal.com/""><b>lydialicious</b></a>&nbsp;</div>and post it. Partly to prove that I still exist, and also to update those of you that might care a smidge on the past twelve months of my life in a particularly vague and non-committal fashion.&nbsp; Plus, I think I did it last year.&nbsp; Or maybe the year before.<br /><br />Don't take this to mean that I'm back. I'm not sure I have the patience for doing this as regularly as I once did. In fact, I'm pretty sure I don't. Nevertheless...&nbsp;<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"" text=""My 2007.""><em>1. What did you do in 2007 that you'd never done before?</em> <br />I grew a beard! Well, I suppose I did attempt to grow a beard at university, but I clearly wasn't old enough to do it back then. Now I am. And I look better for it (I'm told). Also, I learnt to juggle. <br /><br /><i>2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?</i> <br />I'm not sure that I made any last year - if I did, I certainly didn't keep them. My one resolution for 2008 is: Do better at stuff. I can't fail. <br /><br /><i>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?</i> <br />Nope. <br /><br /><i>4. Did anyone close to you die?</i> <br />Thankfully, no. <br /><br /><i>5. What countries did you visit?</i> <br />Absolutely none, which irks me. I've vowed to travel more in 2008 - starting with New York in March (hopefully). <br /><br /><i>6. What would you like to have in 2008 that you lacked in 2007?</i> <br />Motivation, a willingness to try new things, and far less worrying. I've been told I upped my game in the final few months of 2007, so here's to that continuing next year... <br /><br /><i>7. What date from 2007 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?</i> <br />Despite many memorable occasions, the dates don't really stand out. <br /><br /><i>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year?</i> <br />Apart from the beard?! Getting promoted at work, I suppose. I kicked ass in that interview. <br /><br /><i>9. What was your biggest failure?</i> <br />My usual personal failings - laziness, a lack of confidence, and my ability to get swept away in daydreams. <br /><br /><i>10. Did you suffer illness or injury?</i> <br />Not really. I injured my ankle playing football and for a while (a long while, thanks to the NHS) there was a fear I may have broken it. But I didn't. Still had to sit on the sidelines for two months, though. Grr. <br /><br /><i>11. What was the best thing you bought?</i> <br />Other than quite a few good CDs and books... The Christmas tree and mini entertainment centre that made our living room look like a real living room at New Year! Clearly I know how to splash the cash. <br /><br /><i>12. Whose behavior merited celebration?</i> <br />The creator of Facebook. Never again will I be bored at work. Oh, and all of my friends. I'd be nothing without them. <br /><br /><i>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?</i> <br />It didn't <i>appall</i> me as such, but my ex-girlfriend's behaviour in January/February (and beyond) was rather ludicrous. At one stage, I got a soaking from her wine glass. I've since been told by women that this never happens unless I did something wrong. Really, I didn't. <br /><br /><i>14. Where did most of your money go?</i> <br />Er... rent, food, general living expenses... <br /><br /><i>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?</i> <br />For a long time, a certain someone moving to London; just about everything from November onwards. <br /><br /><i>16. What song will always remind you of 2007?</i> <br />There are <i>far</i> too many answers to this question. <i>Australia</i> by the Shins. <i>Under The Blacklight</i> by Rilo Kiley. <i>Rain</i> by Bishop Allen. <i>Hey There Delilah</i> by the Plain White T's. Loads more. <br /><br /><i>17. Compared to this time last year, are you: <br />i. happier or sadder?</i> Happier, despite an annoying start to 2008. Definitely happier. <br /><i>ii. thinner or fatter?</i> A lil bit fatter, I imagine. <br /><i>iii. richer or poorer?</i> A tiny bit richer. God bless my promotion. <br /><br /><i>18. What do you wish you'd done more of?</i> <br />See more of London. I'm sure that sounds ridiculous, given that I <i>live</i> here, but sometimes I'd like to go out and do the touristy things, but I never do. Come to think of it, I wish I'd seen more of everywhere. I swear, there will be more travelling next year! <br /><br /><i>19. What do you wish you'd done less of?</i> <br />I wish I'd done less thinking about a certain someone. In hindsight, it was a waste of a good six months. Also, procrastinating. <br /><br /><i>20. How will you be spending New Year's?</i> <br />I guess I should have done this last year, right? We had a house party. People came. It was fun. <br /><br /><i>22. Did you fall in love in 2007?</i> <br />Tricky word, that. <br /><br /><i>23. How many one-night stands?</i> <br />None. I put this down to me being a nice guy. Also, the fact that I easily get wrapped up in the wrong people. <br /><br /><i>24. What was your favorite tv program?</i> <br />Heroes, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, and Flight of the Conchords. <br /><br /><i>25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?</i> <br />I'm not sure I really <i>hate</i> anyone. I certainly dislike some people more, though. <br /><br /><i>26. What was the best book you read?</i> <br />I'm pleased to say that I started reading a lot more than usual in 2007 - it's just a shame my train journey to work is only ten minutes long. My best read had to be the <i>His Dark Materials</i> trilogy. It was just a shame <i>The Golden Compass</i> movie didn't do it justice. <br /><br /><i>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?</i> <br />The Apples in Stereo, Tegan &amp; Sara, Bishop Allen, Okkervil River, Kinematic, The Weakerthans. And about a million others. <br /><br /><i>28. What did you want and get?</i> <br />I'd like to think I'm not a particularly demanding person. Of course, that's not true... <br /><br /><i>29. What did you want and not get?</i> <br />A New Year kiss...? <br /><br /><i>30. What was your favorite film of this year?</i> <br />I didn't go to the cinema nearly as much as I would've liked in 2007. <i>Transformers</i> and <i>The Bourne Ultimatum</i> were jolly good fun, but my favourite new-to-me movie I saw was <i>Stranger Than Fiction</i>. Such a cute movie. <br /><br /><i>31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?</i> <br />My birthdays suffer from regularly falling around the time of Red Nose Day - this year it happened to be the exact date. So, myself and a whole bunch of friends from work got drunk in Television Centre and took photos of our escapades. I turned 28. <br /><br /><i>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?</i> <br />I don't want to sound a tad pathetic by saying a girlfriend, but... a girlfriend. Shut up. <br /><br /><i>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2007?</i> <br />A bit of a mixed bag. I don't really fit into any particular style, and feel equally at home in a smart shirt or a non-chav hoodie. As a result I'm pretty average however I look. <br /><br /><i>34. What kept you sane?</i> <br />Certain people. They shall remain nameless until question 38. <br /><br /><i>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?</i> <br />Maybe I'm getting older (well, I AM getting older), but no-one in particular stands out right now. Except Jenny Lewis. She's hot. <br /><br /><i>36. What political issue stirred you the most?</i> <br />I'm pretty liberal, so take your pick. <br /><br /><i>37. Who did you miss?</i> <br />I'd like to think I remain in contact with the people that remain important to me, but that's not true in a few cases. Amanda and Shanelle for starters. I must work on that. Reminder: Do better at stuff. <br /><br /><i>38. Who was the best new person you met?</i> <br />A couple of people from work stand out, none moreso than my friend Jenn. She's funny, intelligent, and oddly inspiring. I'd date her given half the chance, but sadly I think I'm probably ""mayor of the zone"". <br /><br /><i>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2007?</i> <br />Most things aren't half as scary as I make them out to be. <br /><br /><i>40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year.</i> <br />I'm pretty sure the song hasn't been written yet. That's right, I refuse to play ball with this question. Ha! </div><br />Right, that's done. See you in 2009...?&nbsp;<br />"

2.  I've finally uploaded a couple of pictures from our New Year party to my <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/93602465@N00/"">Flickr</a> account.  Many more were taken, and they will probably be added in time, but these were my favourites.  And I'm not in any of them.

3.  I currently have four different CD's on order from varying online stores, which is something of a simultaneous personal record.  The race is most definitely on to see whether Lou Barlow, Johnathan Rice, Joshua Radin or The Shins arrive at my doorstep first.  I'm trying to curb my excitement so that each one will be a pleasant surprise, but it's proving difficult.

"event","Okay, so no-one will particularly care, but I feel the need for some narcissism this evening after scoring my first <u>ever</u> goal for the Dorchester supporters' team today in a match at Salisbury.  I scored our fourth in a 4-4 draw, although we picked ourselves up from a second-half collapse (we were leading 4-1 at half-time, but had no substitutes and no energy after the break) to come out victorious, 6-5 in a penalty-shoot-out afterwards.  Quite a match for the vast crowd of... seven.  I'm delighted though, especially as I wasn't originally going to play, and was only roped in on Thursday evening.

In other news, it's our first party in the new house tomorrow, the timing of which is of no coincidence at all, and I'm thoroughly looking forward to it.  I'm not really sure what to expect as we have 15 or so confirmed attendees (nothing too adventurous for our first bash), and although some might bring friends and a few work colleagues may make an appearance, the weather is expected to be horrific tomorrow and I fear it might put some off travelling across London.

Regardless, I'll hopefully be taking plenty of photos (note to self: charge camera's battery), so hopefully I'll be able to kick my Flickr account into shape early next week with some jovial snaps of the festivities.

By the way, you're all invited.  Though I imagine it's a <i>tad</i> short-notice for near-enough all of you.

I've decided that 2007 is going to be a far superior year to 2006.  Sure, this year was good in the respect that I moved to London, established myself in my job and once shared a lift at Television Centre with Juliette Lewis, but next year I really want to make more of things.

My last update was very brief, and suggested that things were definitely looking up on the house-hunting front.  Well, on Saturday, I move out of the small flat with the craphole bathroom and not-very-nice housemate, and into a lovely (and huge) apartment with my friends Scott and Richard.

And I absolutely cannot wait.

I should probably at this stage explain further how it's going to be great - the free satellite TV, for example - but I'm absolutely shattered after playing football this afternoon (and picking up a knee injury in the process), so I shall be going to bed instead.

One final thing before I do, though - I've discovered a great (indie) club in the centre of town (just off Tottenham Court Road) called The Roxy.  On Thursday nights (perhaps others, but that's so far been our night of choice) it likes to randomly throw unannounced songs by the Postal Service, Rilo Kiley and Death Cab For Cutie into its mix, and I love it.

"event","I am a bad, bad LJer.  But, in my defence, I've also been quite busy since returning from holiday.  Though probably not busy enough to warrant nearly three weeks between arriving back in England and updating my journal, so let's move swiftly on...

The holiday was really, really great.  The weather was fantastic, to the point that I picked up a (very slight) tan on my face and arms.  The villa was lovely, complete with its own swimming pool and views of the Mediterranean from the roof.  The company was particularly good, considering that I already see these people five - if not six - days a week, every week.  On the whole, a very relaxing, chilled out week.  Photos, when I get round to resizing them all, will appear in <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/93602465@N00/"">my new Flickr account</a> - but there's a couple there already should you be that impatient.  Or senile.

Perhaps one of the best things about the holiday has been my frame-of-mind since my return.  I don't know what triggered it, but I'm now trying to make a conscious effort to be more efficient with my free time.  I live in London, after all, and I'm really not taking advantage of that fact.  So I want to start going out more in the centre of town, enjoying the parks and museums and coffee shops that I've so far mostly avoided thanks to living and working on the west side of the city.  Once upon a time I yearned for such a lifestyle - to the point that I dubbed it <i>'Jamestopia'</i> - so it's about time I got up off my arse and gave it a go.

One step that I'm taking is moving house.  Along with Scott and Richard, who were both part of our holiday group, I'm currently looking for a new place in Ealing which will hopefully make me feel more at home.  So far the search has been limited, but fingers crossed that something wonderful and within budget will soon make an appearance.

My other major news from the last couple of weeks (I told you I had been busy!) is that I had another interview to earn a permanent contract at work, and this time I was actually successful.  Even though I felt just as nervous as the last time (when, if you recall, I ballsed it up supremely) I apparently did a very good interview, and on some questions I even gave the best answers out of all of the seven candidates.  Not that it really matters, seeing as all seven of us were awarded with permanent contracts afterwards.  Nevertheless, I'm delighted, as it means they can't offload me at Christmas amid threats of downsizing our team.

On the same day that I discovered the outcome of my interview, I also found out that I'll be moving channels - leaving behind the rather monotonous routine of UKTV Bright Ideas (although I've mostly been working on UKTV G2 recently), and taking on the challenge of the slightly bigger UKTV Gold, which is the network's flagship channel.  Plenty of things there to stop me getting bored, and I'm sure it'll look a bit better on my CV.  Whenever I choose to update that old thing.

To complete what has possibly been my most extensive update all year:
-- I'm currently reading <i>The Graduate</i>, and finding it rather tedious;
-- I've just finished watching season two of <i>Lost</i>, and I'm as confused as ever;
-- I last went to the cinema to see <i>Little Miss Sunshine</i>, which was excellent;
-- And just lately I've been listening to all sorts, as usual, although I did get a bit obsessed over the new Scissor Sisters song one night last week... Um, yeah.

Right, that's your lot.  I need an <strike>early</strike> earlier night tonight as I'll be enjoying the delights of London tomorrow evening on a work colleague's leaving do.  I'd have thought I've already drunk enough beer this month both during the holiday and afterwards, but my ever-increasing belly apparently begs to differ..."

On Friday I wasn't too bothered, because I arrived home rather late after a night out and was only just about to go to bed when I heard it.  If anything, I find it quite humorous, because he's not exactly a great singer.

Last night, though, was more than a little annoying.  I'd been hoping to get a decent night of sleep, as it was finally a temperature that wasn't going to result in me waking every two hours, but then - at some point between two and three in the morning - came his (frankly rubbish) interpretation, belting out of Sarah's bedroom.  Over, and over, and over...  <i>""If I lay here, if I just lay here...""</i>

I really wished he just bloody did lie there.

Thankfully there is some light at the end of this most tedious of tunnels.  During our night out on Friday, a discussion between myself, Richard and Scott resulted in the decision to look for a place to live together when we return from holiday in September.  Or maybe it was in August, before we go... the specifics of said discussion are clearly unclear at the moment.

But - I'm happy.  I have a holiday on the horizon, the football season is starting soon, and by October I should be living with people that I actually get on with.  Now I just need to make sure I get a permanent position at work, so that I still have a job after the New Year..."

Maybe I'll get to sleep properly tonight.

I don't think I've updated in... forever.  Things have certainly happened in that time.  Nothing particularly major, but things I'd maybe wish to share for no real reason, nonetheless.  Like succumbing to the corporation and buying an iPod.  Or arranging a holiday to Menorca in September with five friends from work.  Or the fact I've been seriously entertaining the idea of moving house in a month or two.  Again.

"event","I came home from work today (limping, because I appear to have picked up a foot injury whilst playing football) to find Sarah in a surprisingly good mood and with news that our rather useless washing machine is to be replaced.

It caught me somewhat unaware, and for a while I wondered whether this place was really so bad, and that perhaps I should stay here after June rather than looking for a new houseshare (having met up with those two potential flatmates last Friday, I've since heard nothing, and it would appear that they were as unimpressed with me as I was with them).

But then, whilst watching Big Brother (shut up) this evening, that bloody fire alarm went off again.  And again.  And again...  I think I was downstairs switching it off and on for about five minutes in total, before I was finally able to hobble back up two flights of stairs and continue with my evening.  All whilst Sarah remained locked in her room, doing whatever it is she does in there.

I more-or-less have a week left to tell my landlord and housemate that I won't be renewing my contract in July.  Unfortunately, there appears to be bugger all in the way of appropriate houseshares available from the beginning of that month.  Should I take the risk by giving my notice and hoping something decent becomes available?  Or shall I stay, and put up with the inconsiderate housemate and that wretched fire alarm?"

Sarah's just returned from an evening out with her mother, and was approached by the same woman - also for a second time this month.

Sarah however, for all her bad traits, clearly has more balls than I do, as she confronted the woman about this repeat performance, before promptly coming home and reporting it to the police.

Take that, crime!"

"event","What a difference a weekend makes.

Not only did I have a rather fantastic Saturday afternoon with Matt, Heather and Scott (a guy from work who, like us, lives in Ealing) watching <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/4756045.stm"">Liverpool win the FA Cup</a>, but things are potentially looking up on the housesharing front, as well.

I found an ad on Gumtree on Sunday by a guy and girl that have fallen out with their other flatmates, and are seeking one or two likeminded people to go househunting with, with a view to moving at the beginning of July.  Sounds ideal for my situation.

Spookily, the girl in question - Chelley - not only works in the same building as I do, but has also met me before, too.  She was one of the housemates in <a href=""http://magpie-no-7.livejournal.com/210677.html"">the flat that I looked at in February</a> when I was previously peeved with Sarah, and it transpires that both she and the guy that eventually moved into that room (who I simply know as Alan) no longer get on with the couple that also occupy their flat.  From what I've been told, they're an awful lot like Sarah in their social habits, but more rude and bitchy in addition.

Chelley, on the other hand, seems perfectly nice.  From what we've talked about (via emails sent during work hours, I must admit), she and Alan are looking for a household much like the one I've been seeking all along.  So we're going to meet up for a drink and a chat- possibly on Thursday - and see how we get on.  One good sign is that Chelley apparently picked me out to move into their flat in February, before I turned it down due to the room being too small (and that the couple there made me a little uncomfortable - which perhaps suggests, in hindsight, that I might be a good judge of character).

So, for the first time in a while, I'm excited.  Roll on Thursday."

Life is quite peachy at the moment.  Work is very busy due to the imminent arrival of a new scheduling system, but I've enjoyed it a lot more since I've actually had a variety of tasks to do each day.  My contract has been renewed, too, until September, and my responsibilities will soon be shifting to a channel that is showing live coverage of the World Cup in the summer.  That should increase my workload even more, but I'm rather looking forward to it, nevertheless.

Things at home have improved, too.  Sarah continues to be rather elusive (she's on holiday in Austria at the moment, so I have the place to myself for nearly two weeks), but I feel much more comfortable than I did back in February.  It remains to be seen what I'll choose to do when my tenancy is due for renewal in July, but I'm more-than confident that I'll be here until then at the very least.

Finally (because I'm tired, as usual), I've been discovering some great music just lately, partly due to my switch to <a href=""http://www.xfm.co.uk"">Xfm</a> in the mornings, and partly because I stumbled on to <a href=""http://music.download.com"">download.com</a> the other day.  New favourite bands include <a href=""http://www.theweepies.com"">The Weepies</a> and <a href=""http://www.marah-usa.com"">Marah</a>, whilst I'm particularly addicted to the new albums by <a href=""http://www.joshrouse.com"">Josh Rouse</a> and <a href=""http://www.rhettmiller.com"">Rhett Miller</a>.  It's also great to hear <a href=""http://www.primalscream.net"">Primal Scream</a> finally ditch the electronic shit and return to some good ol' fashioned rock'n'roll.  Woo-har.  Or something.

I'm sleepy.  I'm going to bed.

"event","I've been able to feel like a proper Londoner this week, as I'm on a week-long training course in the centre of 'town' for our new scheduling system.  It's been quite cool getting the tube all the way into Oxford Circus every morning and having a change of scenery, even if said scenery is rather crowded at times.

My birthday last week turned out to be fairly pleasant.  I worked, but not very hard, and in the evening Matt, Heather and I went out for a few drinks, some food, and some plays on a pub trivia machine that, despite looking reasonably easy, failed to give us any questions we knew the answers to.  My colleagues at work gave me a gift card for HMV (and even though I've been into the Oxford Street store during all three of my lunchbreaks this week, I still - amazingly - haven't spent a penny of it), whilst my parents, before buggering off to Cyprus on holiday, gave me some money which is meant to be for an MP3 player of some variety.  I imagine it'll actually go towards bills, such is life.  I'll also be getting a couple of CDs (The Concretes and Jenny Lewis, I think) from Sean sometime... in July, probably.

I got drunk on St Patrick's Day with the guys from work in a pub on Shepherd's Bush Green.  I drank non-Irish beer due to my dislike of Guinness, whiskey and cider, and discovered that the cute and quiet new girl is not really that quiet after all.  But still very cute, nevertheless.

Okay, I need to sleep.  I'm falling asleep here, and I'd really prefer not to have a repeat of the last two mornings where I've nearly nodded off on the tube.  So I really need to stop writing this rather poor LiveJournal entry right now.

Like, <i>now</i>.

"event","So, there's half an hour left of my mid-twenties, or so people would have me believe.  At 27 - apparently - I'll officially be in my late-twenties.  Mind you, I've 'officially' been old for the past five years now, according to what people write in my birthday cards.

In age-old tradition (pun definitely intended), I'm inclined to say that it all goes downhill from here, but perhaps, for once, I should be a bit more optimistic than that.  I would certainly hope that I haven't peaked just yet.

I don't yet (please note that the 'yet' is reluctantly included in this sentence) have any particular plans for tomorrow.  I'll be at work 9-5 so I'll be with friends, which is a much better prospect than sitting at home on my own and having little to do.  As for the evening, I have nothing special lined up.  There's a work outing on Friday to 'celebrate' St Patrick's Day, so I doubt many will want to have drinks tomorrow evening.  Katherine (from work) and I had played with the idea of catching a film, but her slightly obsessive boyfriend appears to have kicked that into touch, too.  So I guess I'll see how the day goes.  If the last couple of weeks are anything to go by, I might just be too pre-occupied to notice.

Would that mean I could stay 26 for another year?"

I feel really down about it.  I shouldn't be - I'm still earning the same amount of money as those that were successful today, and I'll still be doing exactly the same job for the next three months at least, but I can't help but feel like crap this evening.

I resent the fact that I can do my job as well as anyone (if not better, considering I work on two channels already) yet permanent contracts are only offered to those that can talk the talk in an interview situation.  I'm a little peeved that some candidates were given the morning off to prepare whilst I was stuck trying to recover my shittest week yet and also train a temp that's only just started to take notes of what I've been trying to teach him for the last ten days.  But most of all I'm fucked off with myself for crumbling into a bag of nerves in the interview and forgetting everything I already knew.  Like, the English language.

I was told afterwards that there'll be other opportunities in three months or so.  Whether that's true or not (I'm inclined not to believe it, given the news earlier in the week), it'll be even tougher then as more people from my own team (ie, my friends) will be eligible (there were only two this time, and we were both unsuccessful).

Everyone was really supportive afterwards.  As soon as the email went round the department announcing who had been successful (not particularly tactful, but at least it didn't say <i>""By the way, James and Marwa weren't good enough""</i>) I had instant messages from Matt, Heather and Katherine, an email from Tony, and an encouraging ""chin-up"" from Daisy.  Unfortunately, it only served to make me feel worse - and also glad that it was pushing on for 5:00pm.

I suppose I should see this as an incentive to actively look for a (better) job elsewhere, but the bitch is that I'd just got settled at this place and was properly coming out of my shell at last.

Fuck."

"event","A meeting at work today brought the revelation (although it was kinda half-expected, so I'm not sure I can correctly call it such) that from the Autumn, the eight Planning Assistant roles within my team will be reduced to five, whilst the number of Programme Planners will be cut from ten to seven.  It was stressed, however, that there won't be any redundancies.  Instead, some of those on fixed term contracts (of which I am currently one) will simply not be kept on after their contracts expire.  Forgive me for thinking that's actually no better than simply making people redundant (except, of course, the company save money this money).

I'm not sure how to take the news.  On the one hand, it's a bit deflating - especially when you consider that three of the positions are more-or-less already filled by those with permanent contracts.  On the flipside, it stopped me wondering about whether I should apply for a permanent position or not.  As ridiculous as I find filling out an application form for my own job, I don't really have an option anymore if I want to stay on beyond Autumn.

So I suppose I should probably make a start on that, considering the deadline is tomorrow lunchtime..."

"event","-- I slept for ten hours last night.  I don't think I've done that for a very long time.  Or ever.

-- I have to decide by Wednesday whether I want to apply to make my job permanent.  My current contract has been extended until the end of June and could quite possibly be extended beyond that, but there's no guarantees that would happen.  So it would make sense to apply, given that I like my colleagues and haven't anything else lined up - but I'm feeling too lazy to fill out a form and have an interview, and I'm a little put-off by the idea of my notice period extending to three months.  I can't imagine any future employers wanting to wait that long to have me join them.

-- It looks increasingly likely that I'll be going to work on my birthday.  Restricted leave at that time means that it'd be unlikely I was allowed off anyway, so I haven't bothered making the request.  Besides, if I'm at work I'll at least be with my friends, which is better than being sat at home doing sod all.  Even if I did do something special, it probably wouldn't have beaten last year, anyway.

-- The one thing more embarrassing than buying condoms from a female sales assisant, is having said assistant tell you that they fall under a ""buy one, get one free"" offer, and then suggesting you ""get another box from the shelf"".  All whilst you stand at the front of a large queue.

-- I'm switching my morning wake-up call from <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1"">Radio 1</a> to <a href=""http://www.xfm.co.uk"">Xfm</a>, because I've grown rather tired of Chris Moyles talking for 15 minutes between each song that's played.  This, I imagine, is of interest to no-one.

-- Whilst dropping my colleague Louise's bag from atop a gantry in the Blue Peter garden on Friday night, I vowed to write a tv detective series based around a central sleuth called Jim Perfume.  One day I'll visit the Blue Peter garden when I'm sober."

"event","After my little outburst on Tuesday night over living arrangements, I've decided (well, 90 per cent decided) to try and stick this out for a while longer.  Whilst it's obviously not ideal, I think I may have been a little harsh in my damning of Sarah.  I'd been having a crap couple of days and so perhaps I was taking the brunt of it out on her, rather than being the tad more patient and reasonable person I (like to think I) usually am.

I've actually felt a lot better over the last couple of days, probably because I've had things to keep me occupied and out of the flat.  Last night a huge group of us from work went to the bar in Television Centre (it's become quite the haunt for us Planning guys) to celebrate four birthdays - two of which belonged to Matt and Heather - and much fun was had.  A lot of money was spent as well, judging by the state of my wallet this morning.

In addition to that, this evening I met up with <lj user=""lydialicious""> (for the first time) for a quick drink, which was most pleasant.  I'm a little paranoid that I didn't talk too much (and probably mumbled what I did say), but hopefully she won't hold that against me and might want to do it again next time she's back in town.

On top of that, tomorrow night sees another birthday celebration (or rather a continuation of Thursday) as we head into central London for yet more drinking.  So perhaps it isn't a sociable housemate that I actually crave - it's just a social life.  Either that, or the alcohol simply numbs the pain.

To cover my bases, I went and took a look at that other flat tonight after meeting up with Lydia.  It was nice enough and the housemates were all relatively friendly (spookily, one of them works on the floor below me in the Broadcast Centre - and I'm sure I've also seen her on the tube in the mornings sporting the corporate rucksack), but the room itself would be too small for my computer desk and bookshelf, and there was something that just didn't feel <i>right</i> about the place.  No big deal, really.  I do at least have a roof over my head that ticks all the vital boxes and, if anything, seeing that place made me appreciate this one more.  Besides, I think I can afford to be picky, now that I'm actually living in the area.  And I've already been here nearly two months, so I'm sure the next four (which would lead me up to the official end of my tenancy here) will fly by.

In fact, if I could just find myself a cinema buddy, I might be set..."

"event","With Peter and Terry heading off on holiday to the French Alps this morning, my last night in Portsmouth (as a resident, at least) was spent alone, watching football and the season finale of 'Rome', whilst trying in vain to get my things sorted out and packed up.

Sadly, packing up an entire bedroom takes a lot longer than I'd like it to.  I so far have just one completed box waiting to be loaded into Matt's or my parents' car in the morning, and that's of CDs.  Only half of my clothes are folded and waiting to be put into a suitcase (the other half remain hanging in my wardrobe), and I haven't even begun to sort through anything made of paper.

I'm a terrible packer, if you couldn't tell.  I think part of that might be down to a certain reluctance to actually leave.  I've always thought that I didn't feel 'at home' in this city, but perhaps I really did without ever acknowledging it.  I suppose in time I probably won't miss it nearly as much as I think I will do just now, but it will certainly be strange to no longer be living with Peter.  It'll be equally as strange to be living on my own with a girl, not least one that I barely know.

Having said that, Sarah does seem very friendly, and I think that we'll get on fairly well.  Only one way to find out, I suppose.

On the internet front, I may be gone for a little while.  I'll still be able to check my gmail account at work and so forth, but don't expect much activity on here until I get some internet access set up at my new home - I'm not sure how long that's going to take.

Right, I think it's time for me to head off to bed.  My parents are due to arrive at 10:30 in the morning, with Matt expected at midday.  I have an awful lot to do before then."

"event","So, I'm back in at my folks' in Dorchester for Christmas, and I think I may have finally got into the seasonal spirit... just.

I left it late to wrap my gifts this year (to the extent that I've only just done it - now that my parents have gone to bed - and I immediately put them out under the tree), and it occurred to me that I haven't been particularly imaginative with the presents I've bought.  It's CDs and vouchers, mostly, with the main exception being my nephew Oliver, who, to my delight, is finally getting into football and will therefore be receiving an abundance of such-related items.

Unfortunately he's chosen to support Arsenal.  Stupid kid.

I've made something of a vow to myself over the past week that next year will be an even better Christmas than this one.  It's not that I think this one won't be at all enjoyable, because I'm sure it will be.  I just think that my lack of preparation and limited free time has left me feeling somewhat un-Christmassy, when I usually revel in the build-up like an eight-year-old.

So next year I plan to be organised, spend far more time searching for presents, and I also allow myself to daydream a little and imagine that I might have a significant other to spoil.  I haven't had a girlfriend at Christmastime since I was going out with Kelly whilst at university in 1998, and even then we'd only been together for less than a month.  It would be nice to have someone else to buy for in addition to my family and closest friends, and I would love to share with someone all the shopping, the wrapping, the parties and the cheesy Christmas songs that should/would/could get me much more festive than I've felt recently.

Maybe all I want is to have something different at this time of year.  I always come home to my parents' for the 25th, and I always (for the last three or four years, at least) spend New Year in the company of Matt and Heather, and this year is exactly the same.  Although, having said that, New Year will be spent in London this time, at a party being hosted by our colleague Steve.  I have to admit that I'm rather looking forward to that, although I've yet to figure out the logistics of getting back to Dorchester for one of the big football derby matches on the 2nd, then back to London for work on the 3rd, whilst spending the night inbetween in Portsmouth.

Anyway, I had best get some sleep.  It feels like I haven't had any for the past week.

I hope everyone on my friends' list (and anyone else who happens to read this - of which I imagine there to be none) has a fantastic Christmas, wherever you are and whatever you're doing.  Happy Holidays!"

"event","Today was a much-needed day off work, partly because I went to see Coldplay at Earl's Court last night and didn't get home until 2:15 this morning, and also because I had a mountain of things that I both wanted and needed to get done.

And I still haven't done half of them.

I'm really looking forward to being settled in London in the New Year.  Okay, so I haven't found a place yet (that cheap-yet-nice-looking flat within walking distance of Ealing Broadway [that comes with cool housemates] is proving rather elusive at the moment) - but I'm already looking forward to the days when I can get home from work at a sensible hour (like, six o'clock) and actually have time to do all the things that life dictates.  I haven't eaten properly for weeks, I haven't slept right for over a month, and my room hasn't been tidied since I've had this new job.  And I cannot wait for that to change.

Look at me, I'm moaning again.

The Coldplay gig last night was awesome - amongst the best I've been to, without question.  The energy was tremendous, the atmosphere amazing, and the whole performance was terrific.  <i>Fix You</i> and <i>In My Place</i> were particularly great, but my favourite, I think, was <i>Yellow</i> - maybe I'm just a sucker for giant balloons filled with gold confetti or something.

It was great, too, to finally meet up with <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/lizvang"">Liz</a>, who took the spare ticket I'd seemingly had - and forgotten about - for ages.  She enjoyed herself, and thankfully more appropriately than the girl behind me who kept shrieking in the middle of just about every song that was played.  I'm all for enthusiasm, but she (the girl behind me, not Liz) was annoying.

In other news (briefly, because I've noticed that I have to be awake again in less than six hours, and I probably need to iron some clothes before going to bed), I'm not the slightest bit prepared for Christmas.  I can't believe it's just over a week away - I've barely started my shopping (save for those that are abroad), and now I only have Sunday left to finish that.  I haven't yet sent my cards, either, nor have I told my parents or brother of anything that I'd like to receive myself.

It's annoying, because I love this time of year and I especially like to savour the build-up to Christmas (I find it quite inspiring too, in terms of writing) - but with so many things on my plate lately, everything seems to have rushed by at 1,000 miles an hour without giving me any time to even think about it.

Okay, I really have to dash now.  I have a pair of jeans that are demanding my attention and a bed that needs to be slept in.  As for the email to my parents that I've been meaning to send all week... well, that will just have to wait another 24 hours."

"event","Y'know, it's taking just about every little bit of positive energy in my body - which at the moment doesn't constitute a great deal - to stop me from actually deciding whether some things are worth it or not.

Sometimes I wonder if I'll be doing this commute forever.





I probably should have been in bed an hour ago."

By the same token, I'm beginning to get the creative bug again.  It's been so long since I've had a desire this strong, but I can't wait to be properly settled in London and working on a project of some sort.

Hurrah for both these things."

"event","This entry has been a long time coming.  An awful long time coming, really.  And it was going to be a really great entry about how I'm settling into my new job pretty well, how I'm becoming quite the expert in handling the underground in the commuter rush, and how excited I am about the coming months.

But instead, my body has chosen to give up on me over the last few days and therefore I'm required - by some sort of unwritten law of James' Journal - to dump on you a brief entry of how depressing being ill is.

I've reluctantly had the last three days off work.  On Sunday, when I didn't feel quite so bad, I was hoping that I'd be fit enough to make the journey in, as taking time off after only three weeks in the job can't give the best of impressions.  But, it turned out that I clearly wasn't in a position to go in on Monday.  Or Tuesday.  Or today.

Now, normally when I'm off work I like to cheer myself up by watching ridiculous amounts of <i>Friends</i> episodes - but only last week I finished watching season ten, and it felt a little too soon to return back to the beginning and start all over.  As some sort of compensation, I tried out the extra features on that disc - but only the behind-the-scenes documentary was any good.

So I've been a bit bored.  To the extent that yesterday I reformatted my computer.  And today I started to put it all back.  Yep, <i>that</i> bored.

I'll be going back to work tomorrow.  I'm still far from 100 percent, but I could at least manage a venture outside today and I'm a whole lot better than I was earlier in the week.  The virus that I've managed to pick up (which has, to be fair, been doing the rounds in the office recently) seems to be on its way out, and coupled with the non-prescription drugs (not <i>that</i> kind) I got today, I should be further down that road to recovery soon enough.

A good thing too, because I'll have a shitload of work to do when I get back to the office.

And one day, I'll actually tell you what that work involves..."

"event","Very, very quickly, because I need to get one of those early-night-things in order to be in the right mood to catch my 6:50 train in the morning...

-- My new job, so far, is going pretty well.  The people are friendly, the atmosphere is relaxed, and the work - whilst a little monotonous at times - is far more interesting than anything a call centre could offer me.  My fears of Sunday night are, therefore, largely unfounded.

-- I stayed with Matt and Heather for the last two nights, making this evening the first time I've been at home since early Monday morning.  Needless to say, it's a whole lot easier getting to work from Ealing than it is from Portsmouth.

-- There was a launch party at London's Science Museum last night for the new company name (Red Bee Media, previously BBC Broadcast - which was until recently a subsidary of the BBC should anyone wonder why I don't have a bbc.co.uk email address).  There was free food and a free bar, and therefore, by default, it was a good night.

-- Commuting will, I believe, kill me before too long.  I don't feel too bad right now because I've barely started doing it, but the sooner I find a suitable place to live in the Ealing area, the better.

There you have it.  It's not a lot, I know, but at the moment time is something that is in short supply.  I will eventually get around to emailing people and maybe go into a bit more depth about my adventures in London, but for now, dear friends, it's time to say goodnight.

So, er... goodnight."

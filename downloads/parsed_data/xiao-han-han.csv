"event","Hi Snow, 
    we meet again! Haiz~ today was a moody day for mi. Dunno how to describe; or maybe lack of sleep la~ I began to feel tired of the work that i am doing now. :(
Part of the reason is that the SUPER long travel time which is making mi sick of it. Hmmm... maybe i shouldnt complain so much, who ask mi not sleeping early; but i juz cant miss my favourite shows. My schedule seem so pack that i hardly sleep. Example: Monday got my favorite Jap show ""Love Generation"", but yesterday was the last episode already...(""Food Fight"" part 2 will be next); then followed by the ""Shi(2) Zhi(4) Lu(4) Kou(3)"", a 11:30 taiwan celebrity show.( this i juz cant miss it! Veri funny~) This is only my Monday programes, there r lots of programme for the following days.~

The other reason... Arrggh~ Is that i havnt get my July's pay. The $420 monthly allowance is my only motivation that keeps mi wakes up early for work. and yet the NTU finance department kept on delaying the payment day. Haiz~ really no mood already ar...
but what keeps mi going throughout this 2 months was that i can d/l and watch all latest movies on threate which indeed save mi a lot of money. hehee... this is so called ""ku(3) zhong(1) dai(4) le(4)"" :D

So much 4 todae Snow~ u r the one whom i share my woes n one more person who always wants mi to update my journal. she is a veri profound gal; dun wwant to mention name la~ Snow i think u shoud noe who la... (hahaha... no offence manz!)

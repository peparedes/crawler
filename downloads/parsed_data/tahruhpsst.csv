"event","I had a better day today :) I went to Knoebel's with Heather and her brothers. I guess they proved that all guys aren't jerks lol. They were really nice. I've never really talked to them all that much. So it was cool to hang out with them.

She picked me up at like 10 in the morning cause we were supposed to leave at 10:30 or 11 to go to her aunts house. Well the plans got changed that her aunt was coming to there house. Well she didn't get there till 11:51 P.M. So we didn't get up there till like 1 or 2. Well that was fine. 

We went on all spinning rides. It was okay. I felt kinda sick after awhile. We went on the ferris wheel and they were throwing mints off of the ride. It was funny. They didn't let us off then so we didn't know if we were going to get in trouble for it. We didn't. It was fun. 

We came home and we were listening to horrible music. So he put in Phil Collins. It wasn't half bad. I didn't realize how many songs I knew off of the CD. Then Heather brought me home. It was fun. But her cousin is kinda annoying.

Sorry Andy I didn't mean anything towards you not all guys are jerks. Thanks Laura I know you are there :) Hopefully, he will come to me or something will be sorted out. 

Well that's all. I'm gonna go. Bye-bye!"

"event","I think all guys turn into jerks at the same time. Like a week and a half ago I went to eat with my friend, Rich, I used to work with at bingo. My mom was with because she wanted to see him too. He was away for about 6 months to a year in Iraq. Well I didn't think much would happen out of it. Me and him have been friends for awhile and I liked him back when I first met him but nothing ever came of it. Well he hugged me when he walked up. Then he kissed me on the cheek which I really wasn't expecting. We went in and got seated. Me and him sat together. He was leaning on me. Then somehow he ended up holding my hand. And then he asked me if I liked him after my mom walked away and I didn't really answer. He kissed me and he said well i take that as a yes. Well we went outside and he just hugged me. That was it. I saw him one time in however long and that was it.

He was supposed to go out to a diner with me and a few people that Thursday and never called. My mom went to bingo and told me that he was there with his ex-girlfriend. Why couldn't he just call and tell me he couldn't make it or something. It makes no sense to me why they just leave you hanging when they say they are going to do something. 

Tuesday he left and his cell phone was dead and he said he was going home to charge it and then he was gonna do something well for the rest of the time he was here his cell phone was off or he had my number blocked or something. Why can't guys confront there problems or why do they make moves if they don't even want to bother then. It makes no sense to me.

Then my friend, Laura, has a guy that is ignoring her. I think all guys become ignorant after they got you in there trap and then you can't let go. Yeah Laura I think you were too later with the don't get attached idea. :( 

Well I'm done complaining about guys.

I got my senior pictures taken last week. I'm hoping they come out good. I went to my friends birthday party last night too. It was interesting. Her family is really loud and I only had an hour of sleep and I wasn't in all that good of a mood as so as it is. 

Well I've been sitting around the house today doing nothing cause for the next two days I am going to be busy. I am going to Camelbeach a waterpark tomorrow. Then Knoebels on Sunday. Hopefully it doesn't rain. We'll see how it goes.

I'll write tomorrow night or the next night. Bye-Bye!"

"event","I haven't had time to write in this often. I will update. Wednesday I went with my mom, nanna, and nephew to get my nephew, Ethan his first pair of shoes. They said he was still too little because he wasn't walking yet. We went to eat at Smokey Bones. It was delicious. I met up with my brother when he came to pick up Ethan and went with him to Pizza Hut but I didn't eat. Then we had to pick up Kirsten and we went to Community Days. It was kinda boring. We won four stuffed animals though.

Thursday I went with my sister to look for bridesmaids dresses for her wedding next June. The one we found in the book isn't out in the stores yet. We have to go back in about two weeks to try on the dress. I actually don't like trying on dresses but it wasn't that bad. Then at 10 I went to the dinner with my mom because those guys go every thursday but I had a headache so I was a little zoned out.

Today me and my dad went to Dr. Sutherland because he had an appointment and he wanted to make me one. My knee is getting really bad and he wants to get it checked before we go back to school because he doesn't want me missing that much school if I do need surgery. I hope I don't. It kinda scares me to think I will need surgery and to be on crutches and all that good stuff.

But there isn't much else going on. I'm really bored and don't have much to do. I'm supposed to go to a big fair with Butz tomorrow. It should be fun. I have a full week next week. I might go to dorney park on monday. Tuesday I watch my teachers kids from 9-12. Wednesday and Thursday I will be in Chincoteague, VA. On Friday I have my doctors appointment.

Well that's all for now. Bye-bye."

"event","Yesterday my brother called me and asked me to go play volleyball with them but I really didn't want to play so I said I would watch my nephew, Ethan. I finally got him to sleep and they ask me if I want to play now. So I start playing and my brother said I wasn't that bad. Then we get home and my dad is mad cause he didn't get his DVD Gods and Generals but everywhere is was sold out.

My brother is supposed to go bowling today but he hasn't called me yet. I am supposed to go with to watch the kids. :) I end up buying food too. How does that work.

I'm going to Six Flags on August 6 with my brother, his wife, and my cousin, Mandy. On July 30th and 31st I will be in Chincoteauge, VA to see the pony swim. I love Chincoteague. We normally go every year but there was to much going on to go for a week. 

Well I gotta do some stuff before I leave. I'll write later maybe. Bye bye."

"event","The other night I found a guys screen name from Long Island New York and it said he was 18. I IMed him because his name was Steve and I figured hey it could be him. I said to him ""Did you go on a cruise within the last few weeks?"" And he says ""Yeah"" but then I asked if he went to Bermuda and he said no the bahamas so it was kind of disappointing because I was hoping it was the guy I talked to on the cruise. It was fun talking to him though. I guess maybe I will look on aol later for other steve's. :)

I also took my 10 month old nephew with me and my friend heather to wal-mart. It was interesting cause Heather works there and knows everybody but I was doing food shopping for my dad. We got done with that and she brought me home and then she left. I went outside when she left and the same car went by four or five times when it finally pulled into one of my neighbors driveways and a guy ran out of it. It was kinda weird.

Then my friend Laura was having problems with a guy. He's done it before and she was really upset and I felt really bad but I really didn't know what to say. She kinda scared me. I know she wouldn't do it but she said some things that got to me because my brother went through it. I talked to her today and she said she was better and she was hoping to go to mexico and come back changed.

There is nothing going on today but tomorrow I am supposed to go up to my sister's house and see her puppy. She has 13 puppies at her house because three of her dogs just had puppies. I love going to her house to see her animals.

Time to go. Seeyah."

"event","Well I was supposed to go to Ocean City MD but something happened that I couldn't make it. There is no reason to bring it up in here cause it is over and done with.

I went bowling with my brother tonight to watch his kids while he bowls. It was actually kinda fun until my nephew got tired. There is a guy there that I saw the first time I went and he was really cute but i saw him the next time and didn't really know but yeah well we'll see. 

I'm going to Dutch Wonderland tomorrow with Mrs. Straub, her two kids, and Heather. It should be fun. Besides the point that I have to wake up at 7 in the morning. Oh well. 

I went to Wal-mart tonight to get sunscreen because I burn otherwise. Heather called off. So I don't know if I am supposed to sleep at her house tonight. I guess I will find out sooner or later. 

Well that's all. Bye bye!"

"event","Thanks for setting this up Laura. :) 

I just got back from a cruise to Bermuda on Sunday. It was an interesting experience. I loved it and hated it at the same time. I went with my mom which I wasn't looking forward to in the first place and then I guess you could say she kept trying to act my age. But I met a guy that was really sweet and everything but nothing really was made out of it. He was from Long Island, New York. He was 18 with a great personality. 

On this Sunday I leave for OCMD with Laura. It should be fun. I go down there with her every year and hopefully this will be the best year ever :) Of course she is 'dating' someone now so it might be a little different.

I'm going to a fair tonight but it's a family thing. So we'll see how that turns out. 

Well that's all for now. Bye bye."

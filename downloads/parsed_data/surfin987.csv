"event","Dear Tech Support:

Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend version 7.0 to Wife version 1.0. I soon noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a  lot of space and valuable resources. In addition , Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other programs and now monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3, Football 5.0 , Hunting and Fishing 7.5 , and Racing 3.6 
I can't seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my favorite applications. I'm thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0 , but the uninstall doesn't work on Wife 1.0. Please help!

Thanks,

(KEEP READING)

REPLY:
Dear Troubled User:

This is a very common problem that men complain about.

Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it  is just a Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an  OPERATING SYSTEM..

You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony-Child Support. I recommend that you keep Wife1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest installing the background application ""Yes Dear"" to alleviate software augmentation.

The best course of action is to enter the command C:\APOLOGIZE because ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will return to normal anyway. 

Wife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife 1.0 comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0 , Cook It 1.5 and Do Bills 4.2.

However, be very careful how you use these programs . Improper use will cause the system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5 Once this happens, the only way to improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0 !

WARNING!!! DO NOT , under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt 3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible damage to the operating system.

Best of luck,
Tech Support"

"event","This is a good variation on a previously cycled theme:

Dear Tech Support:

Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 ...and noticed a
distinct slowdown in the overall performance, particularly in the flower and
jewelry applications, which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0.

In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs such as
Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5. And then installed undesirable
programs such as NFL  24/7, Premiership League 365, World Cup 2006, Fantasy
NBA and NASCAR U-Drive.

Conversation 8.0 no longer runs, and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes the
system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3(BETA) to fix these problems, to no
avail.

What can I do?

Signed,

Desperate
=========

Reply from the Technical Side:

Dear Desperate:

First keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package, while Husband
1.0 is an Operating System.

Try to enter the command: C:/ITHOUGHTYOULOVEDME"" to download Tears 6.2, which should automatically install Guilt 3.0.

If that application works as designed Husband 1.0 should then automatically
run the applications Jewelry 2.0 and Flowers 3.5. BUT remember, overuse of
the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5,
Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1.

WARNING: Beer 6.1 is a very nasty program that will create Snoring Loudly.

CAUTION: Whatever you do, DO NOT install Mother-in-law 1.0 or reinstall
another Boyfriend program. These are not supported applications and will
crash Husband 1.0. In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does
have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might
consider buying additional software to improve memory and performance. I
personally recommend Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 7.7.

Good Luck,

A husband and wife are traveling by car from Key West to Boston.
After almost twenty-four hours on the road, they're too tired to continue, and they decide to stop for a rest.
They stop at a nice hotel and take a room, but they only plan to sleep for four hours and then get back on the road.
When they check out four hours later, the desk clerk hands them a bill for $350.00.
The man explodes and demands to know why the charge is so high. He tells the clerk although it's a nice hotel, the rooms certainly aren't worth $350.00.
When the clerk tells him $350.00 is the standard rate, the man insists on speaking to the Manager.
The Manager appears, listens to the man, and then explains that the hotel has an Olympic-sized pool and a huge conference center that was available or the husband and wife to use.
""But we didn't use them,"" the man complains.
""Well, they are here, and you could have,"" explains the Manager. He goes on to explain they could have taken in one of the shows for which the hotel is famous. ""The best entertainers from New York, Hollywood and Las Vegas perform here,"" the Manager says.
""But we didn't go to any of those shows, ""complains the man again.
""Well,we have them, and you could have,"" the Manager replies.
No matter what amenity the Manager mentions, the man replies, ""But we didn't use it!""
The Manager is unmoved, and eventually the man gives up and agrees to pay. He writes a check and gives it to the Manager.
The Manager is surprised when he looks at the check. ""But sir, ""he says, this check is only made out for $50.00.""
""That's correct,"" says the man. ""I charged you $300.00 for sleeping with my wife.""
""But I didn't!"" exclaims the Manager.
""Well, too bad,"" the man replies.""She was here and you could have!"""

YOUR AGE BY CHOCOLATE MATH



This is pretty neat.

DON'T CHEAT BY SCROLLING DOWN FIRST!
It take s less than a minute .
Work this out as you read ...
Be sure you don't read the bottom until you've worked it out!
This is not one of those waste of time things, it's fun.



1. First of all, pick the number of times a week that you would like to have chocolate 
(more than once but less than 10)









2. Multiply this number by 2 (just to be bold)










3. Add 5












4. Multiply it by 50 -- I'll wait while you get the calculator 













5. If you have already had your birthday this year add 1756 ....
If you haven't, add 1755.














6. Now subtract the four digit year that you were born.










You should have a three digit number 










The first digit of this was your o original number
(i.e., how many times you want to have chocolate each week).










The next two numbers are YOUR AGE! (Oh YES, it is!!!!!)



THIS IS THE ONLY YEAR (2006) IT WILL EVER WORK, SO SPREAD IT AROUND WHILE IT LASTS."

This was the first I have heard of a scheme like this.....  I wanted to pass it along.  Be safe!  Something very serious to pay attention to.  

Criminals are coming up with craftier, less threatening methods of attack, so we have to be extra cautious.  Read on...  I live in< B! ! ! ! R>Alexandria, VA, but I often work in Lafayette, LA, staying with friends when I'm there.  As you know from America's Most Wanted TV program, as well as the news media, there is a serial killer in the Lafayette area.  I just want to let you know about an ""incident"" that happened to me a few weeks ago, and could have been deadly.

At first I didn't go to the police or anyone with it because I didn't realize how serious this encounter was.  But since I work in a jail and I told a few people about it, it wasn't long before I was paraded into Internal Affairs to tell them my story.  It was proximately 5: 1! ! ! ! 5 a.m. in Opelousas, La.  I had stayed with a friend there and was on my way to work.  I stopped at the Exxon/Blimpie Pie station to get gas.  I got $10 gas and a Diet Coke.  I took into the store two $5 bills and one $1 bill (just enough to get my stuff).

As I pulled away from the store, a man approached my truck from the back side of the store (an unlit area).  He was an ""approachable-looking"" man (clean cut, clean shaven, dressed well, etc.).


He walked up to my window and knocked.  Since I'm very paranoid and ""always looking for the rapist or killer,"" I didn't open the window . I just asked what he wanted.  He raised a $5 bill to my window and said, ""You dropped this.""  Since I knew I had gone into the store with a certain amount of money, I knew I didn't drop it.

When I told him it wasn't mine, he began hitting t h! ! ! ! e window and door, screaming at me to open my door, and insisting that I had dropped the money!  At that point, I just drove away as fast as I could.  After talking to the Internal Affairs Department and describing the man I saw, and the way he escalated from calm and polite to angry and volatile....it was determined that I could have possibly encountered the serial killer myself.

Up to this point, it had been unclear as to how he had gained access to his victims, since there has been no evidence of forced entry into victim's homes, cars, etc.  And the fact that he has been attacking in the daytime, when women are less likely to have their guard up, means he is pretty BOLD.  So think about it...what gesture is nicer than returning money to someone that dropped it?????

How many times would you have opened your window (or door) to get your money and say thank you....  because if the person is kind enough to return something to you, then he ! ! ! ! can't really be a threat....can he????  Please be cautious!  This might not have been the serial killer... but anyone that gets that angry over someone not accepting money from them, can't have honorable intentions.  The most important thing to note is that his reaction was NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!  A total surprise!  But what might have happened if I had opened my door?  I shudder to think!"

"event","Story of the Stonecutter 
 A stonecutter was labouring one day, cutting blocks of granite. It was hot and he was unhappy with the hard work. A local official came by the quarry, carried in a covered chair. The poor stonecutter had to walk wherever he went. He watched the official go by, wishing that he could be that important. The Gods were listening, and the stonecutter found himself turned into a city official, being carried through the streets by servents. It was wonderful to be treated with such respect. But as his chair was carried through the streets, he had to stop. He yelled to the servents about the delay.
 
 .... 
 One told him that the emperor himself was travelling through the city, and all traffic had to halt to give him passage. The stonecutter sighed and became angry. He wanted to be emperor so that everyone would have to wait for him. Again, the Gods answered his prayer and turned him into the emperor. The entire city stood by while his caravan travelled by. This was living! Finally, the stonecutter was an important man. As the day wore on, he became very hot. Even the cover on his wagon couldn't protect him from the fierce sun. He looked into the sky and became angry. Even as emperor, the sun was still more powerful than he. He wished to be the sun, and the Gods allowed it. 
 
  
  .... 
 As the sun, he glared down on the world, feeling more powerful than ever. Until a cloud floated in front of him, and blocked his hot rays from the earth. Again he wishes, and again the Gods transformed him. Now he was a cloud, blocking the sun and raining on the world. He moved through the sky, enjoying his new great power, until he was blocked by a tall mountain. How could this mountain be more powerful than I? The Gods turned him into the mountain. Now he was huge, massive and untouchable. That was great power. Then he felt something chipping at his base. What could be stronger than a great mountain, he thought? Down on the ground, there was a stonecutter.
 
  
  And the Thought Today is .... 
 I'm sure the moral here is obvious. Constant yearning to be something you're not, will never lead to happiness. Even people who may seem to have everything, probably don't.
 
  
Blessed Be!"

"event","A curious fellow died one day and found himself waiting in the long line of judgment.
As he stood there, he noticed that some souls were allowed to march right through the Pearly Gates an into Heaven. Others though, were led over to Satan, who threw them into the burning pit.
But every so often, instead of hurling a poor soul into the fire, Satan would toss a soul off to one side into a small pile.
After watching Satan do this several times, the fellow's curiosity got the best of him. So he strolled over and asked Satan what he was doing.
""Excuse me, Prince of Darkness,"" he said, ""I'm waiting in line for judgment, but I couldn't help wondering, why are you tossing those people aside instead of flinging them into the Fires of Hell with the others?""
""Ah, those..."" Satan said with a groan, ""They're all from the Pacific Northwest... they're still too wet to burn."""

"event","Friday the 13th 
 Personally, I hold no particular fear of any Friday that is on the 13th, but many people do. Millions (yes, millions) suffer from paraskevidekatriaphobia in the USA. Though this particular superstition is not specifically Pagan, there are several Pagan aspects to its possible origins. 
 
 Origins of this Superstition 
 The above-linked article by our Urban Legends Guide is great and has a complete list of all the various ways 13 and Friday have been considered bad luck. I'm touching on a few of them today.

The best known would be the idea that a witch's coven always had 13 members. Where that stereotype came from will wait for a different discussion. Pre-Christian Rome held its executions on Fridays. Friday was named for the Norse Goddess Freya, Goddess of love and magick. She was labelled a witch by the new Church because of her ties to magick, adding further negativity towards poor Friday.
 
  
The Knights Templar 
 One particular example of a possible souce for connecting both the number 13 and Fridays is the end of the Knights Templar. On October 13 (a Friday) in 1307, this powerful brotherhood of knights was destroyed, with the men involved hauled off in chains to face torture and execution for unproven crimes. For more details on this event and others related to Friday the 13th, please visit the Urban Legends site. His article is excellent.
 
  
Blessed Be! 



Thank you Terri Paajanen!"

"event","To Be 6 Again:

A man was sitting on the edge of the bed, observing his wife, looking 
at herself in the mirror.  Since her birthday was not far off he asked 
what she'd like to have for her Birthday.
""I'd like to be six again"", she replied, still looking in the mirror.
On the morning of her Birthday, he arose early, made her a nice big 
bowl of Lucky Charms, and then took her to Six Flags theme park. What a 
day! He put her on every ride in the park; the Death Slide, the Wall of 
Fear, the Screaming Monster Roller Coaster, everything there was.
Five hours later they staggered out of the theme park. Her head
was reeling and her stomach felt upside down.

He then took her to a McDonald's where he ordered her a Happy Meal 
with extra fries and a chocolate shake.
Then it was off to a movie, popcorn, a soda pop, and her favorite 
candy,M&M's. What a fabulous adventure! Finally she wobbled home with her 
husband and collapsed into bed exhausted.  He leaned over his wife 
with a big smile and lovingly asked, ""Well  Dear, what was it like being six 
again??""
Her eyes slowly opened and her expression suddenly changed.  ""I 
meant my dress size, you dumb ass!""

The moral of the story: Even when a man is listening, he is gonna get 
it wrong."

After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.



The monsignor replied, "" When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpi! t, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.""



So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice.

At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.



He proceeded to talk up a storm.



Upon his return to his office after the mass, he found the following note on the door:

1) Sip the vodka, don't gulp.

2) There are 10 commandments, not 12.

3) There are 12 disciples, not 10.

4) Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.

5) Jacob! wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass

6) We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J.C.

7) The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior and the spook.

8) David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.

9) When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ass.

10)We do not refer to the cross as the ""Big T.""

We ate, drank and talked about everything. It was good to see them...just them and not have to worry about kids and others. (we normally go out in a group)
Then we went to a pub and for a cool cover band and Pear cider. Julie and I danced our little hearts out (I think I might of lost a pound or two!) Ryan and Brian played pool and Ryan even had some guy buy him a round of drinks! I guess my guy is eye candy! hahaha
This night ended a bit better. Got home at 2am. And yes, woke up at 9am yet again. 

Went to the beach on Saturday the 12th. Picked up my niece Lexie from her new private boarding school here in Oregon. (it's about an hour away) She has gotten so big. She is 16 now and looks just like her mom did at her age. Lexie and Amoore had a really good time. The waves were at 20 feet so no surfing, but really cool to watch. It only rained for an hour or so. That was nice!

Then Ryan and I went to my friend Gus's bar and restaurant's for a few drinks before we met up Lonny and Gretchen. He never lets us pay when we go there so I feel bad and don't like to go there to often. As I was leaving he gave me a kiss and told me that he was shutting down at the end of the month and he would call me soon so we can do lunch. I feel really bad about it. He is such a good guy...he's been doing two jobs for over 2 years. So I guess one of them has got to give?!?!? We met Lonny and Gretchen around 10pm or so at this place called Crush...I've been there once before for Gretchen's b-day. The drinks are really good. Naughty girl lemonade had basil vodka in it...oh so good! We were all crammed it to 2 over stuffed chairs and were having a really good time, till we ran out of drinks, so Lonny and Ryan went up to the bar to get them, Gretchen turns to me and says ""Don't they make a cute couple?"" I'm all ""Yeah, they do!"" Then I start to look around and I see we are in a gay bar and the couples sitting across from us are all making out and all of them are girls. I started to laugh and Gretchen is like ""You had no clue this is a gay bar did you?"" I'm all ""Nope, no clue! But I like it here!"" She's says ""So do we, that why we come here!"" So we had a few more drinks (Ryan had some guy ask him to dance)Ryan said maybe later! He's such a good guy. Lonny wanted to go to a real dance club so we left and went dancing at yet another gay dance club...I love going to Embers. The best music and cheep, good drinks and I don't have to worry about some odd guy grinding on me! We stayed till it closed (2:30am) and headed over to the Roxy for an early breakfast! Nothing better than hash browns at 3am!! So needless to say we didn't get him till 4:30-5 am....but my damn internal clock would not let me sleep past 9am!!!!! But it was a good night all around!

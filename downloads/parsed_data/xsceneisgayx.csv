"event","""As each one has recieved a special gift, employ it in serving one another."" [1 Peter 4:10 NASB]

""The world needs servants. People like Jesus, who did not come to be served, but to serve. He chose remote Nazareth over center stage Jerusalem, his dad's carpentry shop over a marble-columned palace, and three decades of anonymity over a life of popularity. Jesus came to serve. He selected prayer over sleep, the wilderness over the Jordan, irascible apostles over obedient angels. He picked the people. Peter, Andrew, John, and Matthew. When they feared the storm, he stilled it. When they had no coin for taxes he supplied it. And when they had no wine for the wedding or food for the multitude, he made both.

He came to serve

He let a woman in Samaria interrupt his rest, a woman in adultery interrupt his sermon, a woman with disease interrupt his plans, and one with remorse interrupt his meal.

Though none of the apostles washed his feet, he washed theirs. Though none of the soldiers at the cross begged for mercy, he extended it. And though his followers skedaddled like scared rabbits on Thursday, he came searching for them on Easter Sunday. The resurrected King ascended to heaven only after he'd spent forty days with his friends-teaching them, encouraging them...serving them.""

""He stripped himself of heaven's robe, layered himself in epidermis and hair, hunched down in our world, and spoke our language in the hope that he could lead this bunch of turkeys back home again. He set aside the privilages of deity and took on the status of a slave, became human! Having become human, he stayed human. It was an incredibly humbling process. He didn't claim special privileges. Instead, he lived a selfless, obedient life and then died a selfless, obedient death-and the worst kind of death at that: a crucifixion.""

Love the overlooked.Jesus sits in your classroom, wearing the thick glasses, outdated clothing, and a sad face. You've seen him. He's Jesus. Jesus works in your office. Pregnant again, she shows up to work late and tired. No one knows the father. You've seen her. She's Jesus. When you talk to the lonely student, befriend the weary mom, you love Jesus. He dresses in the garb of the overlooked and ignored. ""Whenever you did one of these things to someone overlooked or ignored, that was me-you did it to me."" [Matt. 25:40 MSG]

""If you think you are too important to help someone in need, you are only fooling yourself. You are really a nobody"" [Gal. 6:3 NLT]

Don't be too big to do something small.""Throw yourselves into the work of the Master, confident that nothing you do for him is a waste of time or effort"" [1 Cor. 15:58 MSG]

A good action not only brings good fortune, it brings God's attention. He notices the actions of servants. He sent his Son to be one."

"event","She walked up to the doorframe where I was standing. She kissed me softly to show that she cares, yet remains distant. I wouldn't mind if she monopolized all of my time. I wouldn't say a word at all. No not one word. The closer I get, the faster she pushes away. And when I catch on and mind my own business, slowly, in her own time, when it's seemingly convienent, I am blessed with the presence, her touch. I'm under the impression, that apart from God, she is in complete control of our ""relationship"". I have never wanted something or someone more then I do now, but inevitably I have no say and feel completely paralyzed in my incapability to be a man, a real man. A take charge man. The man who sweeps the woman off her feet. The man who reflects the love of God and ignites a fire in the woman he desires. Despite my understanding that I am his workmanship, knowing my faults, and embracing my weakness. I rip down the orange caution signs that God perfectly places so that thigns remain slow. My expectancy sometimes overpowers my sanity, and I perpetually make the wrong choices, which displays to her I'm the wrong ""person"". Indecision is breaking my back, yet my faith in something so impossible maintains the little bit of balance that remains. Regardless of the opinion of man, I know I am of great worth in God's sight. In the end, I know that He is all that matters. Love is all that matters. I see so much of Him in her, which is why she matters. In her absence i will fight. This is my reality."

I know that im far from perfect... i dont think i could ever be the perfect husband or perfect christian... but i do know that Jesus is constantly working on me and that one day all the jaded edges will fall off and expose something beautiful...

i met the most beautiful person ever ladt night... he was an overweight black man, his teeth were screwed up... wore a fanny pack and dirty clothes... crosseyed... talked with a lisp... and totally ministered to me in the middle of a bookstore... touched my heart like no one i have ever met in my life... i realized that you never know if you are entertaining the presence of angels... and i cant help but think that... He really made me change my perspective on how people look and what ones heart may carry, no matter how ""unattractive"" their outside may be...

he told me that when Jesus touched the lepers, it wasnt the fact that He said ""you are made whole"" that blessed them, it wasnt even getting healed... it was the fact that someone cared enough to TOUCH them.... It wasnt the healing of their bodys that changed their lives, it was the act of compassion that no one else would ever do, that changed their entire lives...

that changed my life...

i never want to look at anyone with any kind of judgement or racial profiling ever again... That sweet man in the bookstore might as well have been jesus... because in that moment i felt whole... i felt the love of a stranger... and i felt my calling...

christina and abra, know that i love you girls more than anyone else in my life... you bless me more than ever, and i know that i may say the wrong things sometimes and i might be mis-interpreted sometimes... but please know that you girls make my life so much better and God has blessed me more than i can ever imagine with your friendships...

be blessed..."

I told a friend that when something like this happens (getting kicked out because of your faith and having ABSOLUTLY no where to go), one of two things can happen. 1) you go crazy and begin to harden your heart to the world, and become one of the people that you hate because they hurt you... or 2) you can use the hurt as inspiration to take that next step of faith and let God use more and more...

one of the sweetest girls i know (or so i thought) totally suprised me when she said her and her roommate was gonna drive all the way from arkansas in the middle of the night to spend the weekend... and oh how was i stoked... stayed up till 6 in the morning waiting... and finally they came and i got the biggest hug ever... spent like 20 mins watching music videos, then she said that she had to use a payphone to call her mom and i offered the cell but she insisted on the pay phone... this was at 7:00 am...

i waited like an hour, 2 hours, then i decided to walk up the road, concerned that something happened... well it dawned on me she ditched me... and that seriously broke my heart... who the hell drives 9 hours, and then for whatever reason leaves with no hug, goodbye, anything...

i seriously lost all respect for people... and honestly when i thought that my hurt couldnt get any worse... this happens

"event","So ya, I was just reminded by some old friends that I have a LiveJournal, so I thought I'd maybe start doing some journaling again...this is one that my mom DOESNT have access to. *YESSSSSS*pulls in fist to chest*

For those of you who were telling me to update this beast, here you go:
I am living in a new apartment in N. Tucson (not GHETTO Tucson) with my friend Monica, I have a kitty named Mae Everglow, I am dating a wonderful guy named Uri, I am still a U of A student and I work at Macaroni Grill. I dont even know why I'm writing this though, since those of you who told me start this again already know these things...but whatever. That's what journaling is anyway. So ya, there ya go. 

If you know my URL, you already have my MySpace, so no need to put it on here. Well, gotta go to German and possibly get some studying in for my test in 24 minutes...eeeee...peace out folks.


<3333333


P.S. WOW these pics on here are old, I'll give you guys an update one for good luck..."

"event","<P><FONT color=#336666>WOW, I just realized how long it's really been since I've updated this site. How did 3 MONTHS go by that quickly? Oh well, such is life. Well, my holidays were great and I'm 11 days shy of being on my way to Florida. Getting close! It's been pretty sad, once I realize that I'll be away from everything I know, but well I'm used to that by now. And since I dont have an official home anymore, it's not going to be as traumatizing. I really love traveling and everything, but I hate leaving people that I love. Worst thing EVER. So, all I can do is count down the days that I am there and focus on buying a house here in Tucson for when I come back. Good stuff.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#336666>Ok, well I saw this on Dan's page and thought it was pretty cool...so I stole it. Thanks Dan!!! :0) ...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366><FONT color=#663366><STRONG><EM><U>2004 vs. 2005</U></EM></STRONG></FONT><BR>1. What did you do in 2004 that you'd never done before?<BR></FONT><FONT color=#663366>Came&nbsp;literally 6 inches from death, took Greek Mythology, Italian&nbsp;and Physics (among the others I've never taken before), lived in a frat house- then moved in with some guy friends, served on a jury, witnessed both my mom and sister have affairs on their husbands</FONT><FONT color=#663366>, watched my dad move out of&nbsp;my house, have found some peace, fell in love with someone who hates Abercrombie, realized that that person loves me more than I thought possible...and have realized what it truly feels like to long&nbsp;to spend&nbsp;the rest&nbsp;my days with someone- and have the same in return. Also saw Napolean Dynamite- a FLIPPIN SWEET movie...man, I learned so many skills in that movie. So&nbsp;just let me do whatever the heck I WANT to do, <EM>GOSH</EM>!!! ;0)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>2. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?<BR>I dont remember mine from last year...but&nbsp;I&nbsp;have made some for 2005: to keep up with my devotional bible every day (which&nbsp;so far I've done), to love unconditionally, to quit worrying so much and to remember to&nbsp;hate the sin and love the sinner (thanks, Pam!)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>3. Did anyone close to you give birth?<BR>Yep, my sister Jen&nbsp;gave birth to my beautiful nephew Jonah&nbsp;McGuire! :0)...cutie&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>4. Did anyone close to you die?<BR>Dave Krohn, at age 22...haven't been close with him since I was little, but our families are close friends. Very, very, very sad.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;<FONT color=#663366>5. What countries did you visit? <BR>The good ol' US of frickin' A!!! And Mexico...but only once...for about&nbsp;&nbsp;20 minutes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>6. What would you like to have in 2005 that you lacked in 2004? <BR>I will have&nbsp;a car and home&nbsp;that I purchased myself.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;<FONT color=#663366>7. What dates from 2004 will remain etched upon your memory, and why? <BR>January 19th (day of my accident and, coincidentally, the day I will be traveling to FL...kinda crepy, I know); April 11th/Easter (day Josh and I officially started dating); the day that my jury duty trial ended (phew!); going to The Starting Line concert on the night before my mid-terms...now that's my way of studying!!! :0) (one ""flippin SWEEEEEET""&nbsp;concert, by the way)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>8. What was your biggest achievement of the year? <BR>Loving someone unconditionally and falling in love with God all over again...I love doing that!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>9. What was your biggest failure? <BR>Hmm...losing my temper a few times, not&nbsp;going to&nbsp;Zona Yuth Kamp (HUGE disappointment on my part), not witnessing enough, and letting my relationship slip with God when my family stitch got pretty bad...but only for a couple of weeks, and now we're great again :0)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>10. Did you suffer illness or injury? <BR>Unfortunately...my truck accident and getting folliculitis (a totally random ass infection of the hair follicles, caused by contact with&nbsp;a lake and/or ocean directly after shaving/getting a large wound...and it's a pain in the BUTT to get rid of).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>11. What was the best thing you bought? <BR>Hmm, WELL I would have to say that it was my digital camcorder from Best Buy...which I ordered on December 15th, should have received the 17th and STILL have not received it (due to Best Buy having their heads up their asses). Please pardon the French, it's just been a very frustrating ordeal.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>12. Whose year merited a celebration?<BR></FONT><FONT color=#663366>Definitely my dad on completing his first Ironman race in Florida! (and doing very well by the way), paying off old debts, doing a great job of moving on with certain people and times, and making my Grandma's life a MUCH brighter place. Also, Sonburn...err...Stellar Kart!- on signing with Word Records, shooting their first videdo, bringing others to God and all of their past/future tours. We love and miss you guys soo much!<BR><BR>13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed? <BR>My mother and sister for their adulterous behavior (hey, I'm sorry but that's just not AT ALL biblically, morally, spiritually or EVER right in this world or the next), and John Kerry for putting down Bush- he is a great Christian man who deserves to lead this country...so take your purple hearts and go somewhere where can't put others down. Thank you, come again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>14. Where did most of your money go?<BR>My digital camera- that I STILL haven't gotten...seriously, this kind of torture that they're putting me through should be considered a sin!! gggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...(love the sinners, hate the sin, love the sinners, hate the sin, love the sinners, hate the sin...)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?<BR>Receiving my acceptance packet to the Disney Internship, hearing that I would be getting some settlement, worshipping (that's like every day, but I get REALLY, REALLY excited about it!), and whenever I hear Josh tell me he's coming to see me or hear his descriptions of just how much he loves me...gets me every time :0)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>16. What song will always remind you of 2004? <BR>""White Houses"" by Vanessa Carlton, ""Playing Favorites"" by The Starting Line, ""All Downhill From Here"" by New Found Glory, ""I Believe In a Thing Called Love"" by The Darkness, ""Soco Amaretto Lime"" by Brand New and ""Yeah!""&nbsp; by Lil' Jon.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>17. Compared to this time last year, are you:<BR>A) Happier or Sadder? <BR>Happier</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>B) Thinner or Fatter? <BR>A little bit thinnier (dont worry, I dont look deathly)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>C) Richer or Poorer? <BR>In love,&nbsp;peace&nbsp;and God? MUCH richer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>18. What do you wish you'd done more of? <BR></FONT><FONT color=#663366>More studying, more time at worship service, more concerts, more crack cocaine and Jack Daniels...woah! where did that come from? I mean, uhh...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>19. What do you wish you'd done less of? <BR>See #18...just kidding! :0) Or am I?...*raises one eyebrow and stares&nbsp;challengingly*</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>20. How did you spend Christmas? <BR>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA- funny story. Well, Christmas Eve was spent with my AWESOME aunt, uncle and cousins and talked to Josh on the phone...then we went over to my house for dinner and found my mom and sisters' boyfriends there, during which my mom screamed at me (the norm), I talked to Josh, my mom told me&nbsp;that my&nbsp;room was now a guest room&nbsp;and my sister told me how much she apparently disapproves of my telling her what God thinks of her current behavior. Talked to Josh some more. Later, visited my brother-in-law Scotty. Talked to Josh. Christmas was spent with my dad&nbsp;at my awesome Grandma's house, then with the Vaughts for a great lunch/dinner, then I talked to Josh and&nbsp;headed over to my mom's house where I found the two boyfriends there AGAIN, had my mom scream at me (again) and kick me out...of dinner. Talked to Josh. Then hung out at Scotty's again and told him, in&nbsp;a kind way,&nbsp;that apparently my whole immediate family (excluding my dad) has turned to crack, lost their minds and sold their souls to Satan...basically. Talked to Josh and&nbsp;then I &nbsp;spent the night at Cyndi's house with her awesome family and had a great night!...Then talked to Josh again. Hey, I missed him! :0) haha</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>21. Did anyone fall in love with you in 2004?<BR>Let's take roll...just kidding!!! The only intended one was ""my only one""...Mr. Josh-wa</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>22. Did you fall in love with anyone in 2004?<BR>:0)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>23. How many one-night stands? <BR>Ummmmm, none. Ever. Not even close. ..not evern possible.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>24. What was your favorite TV program?<BR>Considering that I am both an avid university student and first-class procrastinator...I've watched a whole lot of MTV. So, the typical Real World Philly, Battle of the Sexes&nbsp;2 and Laguna Beach. Also, the best show EVER: America's Next Top Model, Cycle 3. I WILL BE THERE SOMEDAY, have no fear...you shall see...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>25. Do you hate anyone now that you didn't hate this time last year?<BR>I dont hate anyone. I strongly dislike some, but heck...I'm a lover, not a fighter.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>26. What was the best book you read: <BR>The book of Matthew (in THE book :0) and <U>Classical Mythology</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;for my Greek Myth. class.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>27. What was your greatest musical discovery?<BR>That I totally LOVE classic rock (Aerosmith, Springsteen, John Mellencamp, Tom Petty) and that my heart and soul are with east-coast bands (Brand New, Taking Back Sunday, Straylight Run, etc.) and&nbsp;punk/alternative/ska (Starting Line, NFG, Homegrown, Yellowcard, Hello Goodbye, etc.). By the way...<EM>MERCY ME IS THE SHIZZNIT!!!</EM></FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;<FONT color=#663366>28. What did you want and get? <BR>Happiness and peace...God sent me Josh, my dad and Aunt Pam.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>29. What did you want and not get? <BR>My mom to stop being herself...and an IPod. I would also appreciate my CAMERA, people!!! COME ON NOW!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>30. What was your favorite film of this year? <BR>Napolean Dynamite. Others were good, but Napolean just sticks out in my mind the most. It was FLIPPIN <EM>SWEET</EM>!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>Josh took me out the whole day- what an awesome guy! Even in the July heat he spoiled me. We saw Spiderman 2 with his brother Brian, went shopping, went to d*&amp;% jury duty, Josh's family celebrated with me,&nbsp;he&nbsp;gave me roses and a beautiful ring :0)&nbsp;and he took me to dinner. It was a fantastic day. How old was I, you ask? Finally old enough to ride the BIG roller coasters at Disneyland and drink out of the tall water fountains at school! Teacher even said so. Uh-huh!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying? <BR>Spending more time at The Refuge...I miss good worship services. Also FINALLY GETTING MY&nbsp;D*&amp;% DIGITAL CAMERA!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2004?<BR>Haha well, slightly different than the typical Lauren...more Etnies, tight pants and short, natural color skater hair than the usual Abercrombie, Guess and long highlights. Hmm, I think that maybe someone has been having an affect on me... and I think their name begins with an ""Jo"", ends with a ""sh"" and wears shoes with stars on the toes. Hmmm...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>34. What kept you sane?<BR>Definitely God and his amazing love!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?<BR></FONT><FONT color=#663366>George Bush and his constant, dependent faith in God. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>36. What political issue stirred you the most? <BR>Obviously the presidential election. GO BUSH!!! Also found it interesting that some musical performers that I normally admire were in the Rock Against Bush stuff (Green Day,&nbsp;Springsteen, MXPX, etc). Oh well, Kerry lost. Shucks.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>37. Who did you miss? <BR>Sarah and&nbsp;Tiffany: I missed hanging out, singing show tunes,&nbsp;laughing, dancing&nbsp;and being around&nbsp;their awesome spirits. *tears* I also missed spending time with the Neiers. You guys are AWESOME and unparalleled. I miss having my twin spirits (and looks) with me! *double tears*</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>38. Who was the best new person you met? <BR>I'd definitely have to say my Josh-wa Monkey, even though it was technically in 2003 :0\ You have such an amazing spirit and GINORMOUS heart! When you look at me, I can just see all the love you have for me and sometimes it's almost too much for my little self to handle. I've never felt&nbsp;anything like what we have before and I am so blessed that God has finally sent me my soul mate. I love you. Can't wait.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366>39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2004: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#663366><FONT size=4>There is a reason for everything and God is in control. Just LET GO AND LET GOD. That's the key to everything...that and music. Music is the food of the soul. So feed your soul, go play your favorite song.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT size=5><FONT size=4><EM>Final lesson of 2004</EM>: Love unconditionally, with your whole heart, no exceptions, for it is the only way to love.</FONT> <BR></FONT><BR>So, with all of that said, HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE! GOOD LUCK IN 2005!!! :0)<BR><BR></FONT></P>"

Adam and are I going to drive up and come back Sunday...short visit, but I'll get to see my dad, kitties and puppies! :0) Can't wait- PART-AYYY tonight and tomorrow with the boys!!! Didn't go to my classes today; in too much pain and I stayed up pretty late doing laundry and sittin around talking- thanks Adam! :0( What a meanie. So anyways, WOW what an interesting couple of weeks this has been. Ryan Cabrera is my hero, ""On the Way Down"" is my new theme song; ""Vibrate"" by Petey Pablo is THE SHIT. I KNOW, HUH?!?! Hahaha Brandon, what a stud...NO YOU ARE!!!! :0) Hahahahaha. 

So now I'm just sitting around, procrastinating starting some homework and patiently waiting for my hair to dry so I can straighten it. Dang curly hair!!! It's awesome and beautiful- except when I want it straight- which is a lot. Then it takes work! But it's definitely worth it :0) Ok, time to stop procrastinating now. Yay, Glendale, here we come!!!

Had some tests last week (not just academic), did pretty well. Have a LOT of homework this week; can't wait for the weekend again. And this weekend out friends from Phoenix are coming down to hang out! Yay!! So that should be tons of fun :0) 

My dad came and visited on Sunday; stayed til yesterday morning and left. So we got to hang out, go to Barnes and Noble :0) and go shopping...where he bought me a stuffed kitty!!! It's an orange kitty and, in honor of my old orange tabby Valveeta, her name is Pita Wita! (Don't ask)...you know lifes getting old when you start naming your stuffed animals. Sad, I know. So now all that I need is a REAL puppy! A 1 or 2-year old German Shepard would REALLY help this stressful homework situation coem along a lot better right about now :0)

Ok, time for beddy by. Full day tomorrow again. My poor legs- all 44 inches of them are totally sore; oh well, tomorrow will be more stressful. Wow, University life is AWESOME!!! Ahhh, the things they DONT tell you in high school...OK, nite nite all |0)"

I've gotten some sleep this weekend and missed a philanthropy this weekend, but it was still good as well :0) Today was Josh and my anniversary, so that was a definite plus of my day! Hes bought me flowers and we got to hang out just us, so it was wonderful :0D Right now, I'm just hangin out in my room, waiting for the rest of our friends from Phoenix to come down and hang out with us. Two of them came down yesterday and hung out; we went to a party but I was DD so they partied and I drove. Hehe but its cool, I liked it much better that way anyway :0) 

So ya, I've had a pretty good weekend so far! Ready for a 1-week break too. Well, I'm gonna go get some homework done, read my bible and hang out with friends. Hooray for Jesus and sleep!!! :-D"

"event","<P>So today is Monday, the last day of our (so-called) long Labor Day weekend. Didn't get a lot of homework done this weekend, no big suprise though. I'll just do a lot tonight and waste the large amounts of soft, peaceful sleep I've had the past couple of nights. Mmmmm :0( </P>
<P>Talked to my dad on the phone for awhile tonight. I miss home again :0( Or I guess not HOME exactly, because my home isnt really home anymore, but I miss the old home and how things were. I wish I could just rewind to like senior year and just stay there again for awhile...well, mkinus the high school part :0) I could stand the keep the easiness of academic material, but not so much the controlingness of my mother and teachers. Wouldnt mind though in comparison to now. I did have GREAT high school years, even though they were a long time ago now, and I do enjoy the freedom I have now...but I dont exactly enjoy all of the responsibility. I liked it a little more when my only worries were how to ditch the ""closed campus"" policy and what costume I should find for my dance test the following Friday. But oh well- so this is life. Bills, irrationtally rude roomates and all. Well not all roomates...but you know ;0) Just the ones who think that they are better than us all, when in reality they are about 45% less mature and about 102% less laid-back than the rest of the world. But oh well, what can you do :0/ Nothing but, as always, put it all in God's hands and let him take control of all situations. </P>
<P>Well, Josh and Kenneth are gonna be over in a few minutes to say hi, so I have to go get some homework done. Last night we went and saw Paparazzi with Mike and a friend Katie- nothin like a little double date, trying to hook them up :0) Too bad we didnt give them more alone time :0( Oh well, we'll try harder next time, right Mike?? ;0) For now, I have to go. Bobby, keep workin on the relationship...maybe more convos at Starbucks will do the trick :0D HAHAHAHA. Ok, nite nite all 0:o)</P>"

"event","<P>Well this has been one of the greatest weekends that I've had in long time. This past week of school was pretty darn good too! My classes were a bit overwhelming at first, but they seem a lot better once you think of things as one step at a time. So ya, all of the maths and sciences are now exciting and fun :0) I have a few friends in most of my classes and am making study groups for the difficult ones- yay!</P>
<P>So ya, this weekend I just basically hung out and got some homework done with Don Don. In general, everything made me very peaceful and pensive. On Saturday we had a block party for our apt. complex, it was pretty fun! They convinced me to do a bikini contest, which I thought would of course be like ones pageants I've been in- descrete and judged on the best body and tact basically. But OH NO- big suprise...so I decided not to do it after girls before me started flashing people and pouring beer all over themselves. Well, I guess I found out what bikini contests are like in the real world- who can be the biggest slut!!! Haha so ya, I think I'll just stick with sanctioned pageants from now on.</P>
<P>I missed church this morning :0( but I got to spend a good part of the weekend with Josh! Yay! :0) So things are wonderful as usual- he is soo amazing and is so wonderful for me.HAd lunch with Bobby this afternoon and now I'm going to get some homework done! Class starts again tomorrow...:0( But I'm kind of excited &lt;:0D Hehehe ok, gonna go clean some stuff up, read my bible and do some HOMEWORK! Talk to you later!</P>

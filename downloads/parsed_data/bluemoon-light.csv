"event","&nbsp;I need to learn to slow down. Everything will happen in time and I kmow this is true, but why can't I stop hoping that time will pass by quickly. I just want to be done with school, get that degree and hopefully get a better paying job, one that I actually enjoy. I cannot wait to move out and into our own place, but I know that right now its not practical. You always reassure me that good things take time and if we just wait a little bit longer, things will be better for both of us&nbsp;in the long run. I know this is true, I trust you. I just cannot let go of this overwhelming feeling, I need to fall asleep next to you and wake up every morning with you by my side. I want to make dinner together, go grocery shopping, get our own dog, do whatever and just be together. It does not take a lot to make me happy, just a place to be with you, a place to spend our lives together. I know this will happen, and&nbsp;I just need to be patient, but if everything could just hurry up and fall into place, that would be great. Thanks.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>When you know who you want to spend the rest of your life with,<br />you want to start the rest of your life,<br />soon as you can.</em>"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the days following the horrible events that took place at Virginia Tech, I have found my self in a reflective and somber mood. There are no words to descirbe the sympathy and pain that I feel for all of those who have been in some way effected by the shootings. Watching the Today Show this morning, they were interviewing two faculty members that lost close friends. They were talking about a German professor who was a beautiful person with a genuine passion for teaching and learning. He had a love of art, photography and even donated his long hair to Locks of Love. It seems as though every innocent person that was cruely taken away from this world was trying to in some way make a positive impact on the world around them, whether through teaching, community service or simply bettering their futures by continuing their educations and recieving degrees. I have an immense respect for the surviving students at VT, those left with the responsibility of carrying on and remembering their lost friends. It is hard to put myself in their shoes, how would I cope? Would I be able to stay on a campus where such a horrific tragedy conspired? I guess we all are unaware of our strength until something such as this brings it to the surface. As I hear about friendships and lives being shattered, it reinforces my belief that all relationships are important. Whether it is waving to the mailman every day, or calling your best friend just to say hi, how's your day? No matter what the circumstances, every life, every relationship is important and none should be taken for granted."

"event","<p>This could either be a really good week, or a really bad one. Let's all hope its the first of those two options. For a while now I've been looking to rescue either a lab or a golden for casey, and I finally found one. One of our clients at the vet told us that her neighbor is foster-caring a four year old female yellow lab. Her name is Riley, she is very well behaved, past all of her puppy stuff, loves people and other animals. Sounds perfect right? Well, her previous owners are moving into a condo and they're trying to find out if she is over the weight limit for allowed pets. If they can keep her they will, but if not, she's coming home with me. Casey can't have a dog at his house, his parents have had bad experiences with dogs in the past, so its unserstandable. So until we can both move out, she will be living here with me, of course with frequent visit from casey. I really want this to happen. If it does, she is going to be my gift to casey for his graduation, he has worked so hard the past two years and he really deserves this. Keep your fingers crossed for us and Riley!! If she comes home with me, pictures will be up :)</p>"

"event","Like clock work every Monday and Wednesday morning while I am sitting here in the cafe at RIC, there is this one guy who comes in and orders two slices of pizza. Now normally this would not bother me, if it was let's see, not 9:30 in the morning. The sight of him just sitting there sucking down two huge, greasy, slices of pepperoni pie makes me want to gag. How can people not care enough about their bodies to know better? I mean pizza for breakfast? Once in a while we're all guilty of it, but come on now, enough is enough. The thing that gets me is that he is a bean pole,. not an ounce of fat on there. What gives? If I did that they'd have to break down a wall to get me out of the room. My gym sesssions would have to last for like five straight hours to counter act all the calories going straight to my hps. Oh well, when one day he's too large to leave his house, he will look back on those early morning pizza binges and cringe.&nbsp;

"event","<p>So last night I went to pick up food at Mr. Taco and I was asked an interesting question. I graduated with the girl who was working the cash register,&nbsp; recognizing eachother, we took a few minutes to catch up. The basic question-answer session ensued. You know, the questions we all ask eachother now, How are you? How's school? etc etc. After the initial questions, she asked &nbsp;if&nbsp; me and Casey were still together, yes we are I answered. Her next question caught me by surprise, are you guys engaged yet? With a little bit of a chuckle I answered that no we weren't engaged, yet. On the way home I got to thinking, are we now old enough to be asking that question? We're all either 19 or 20 now, so I guess it just makes sense that yes, some people may be engaged, but it was just a reality check. The days of being innocent teenagers are behind us now. We're all adults. Its just strange to think that the people you've grown up with since elementary school are now out there in the real world, in college, working full time, getting engaged, making plans for the future.&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course I would love to be engaged to Casey, and when that happens, I know we'll both be ready for it. We're constantly talking about what our future together will be like and we both agree that moving in together feels like the next natural step.&nbsp; Hopefully by the end of the summer this will become a reality. My grandparents own a small house, more like a cottage, across the street from their house, so when my cousin moves out, according to my papa we're next in line. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind living with my parents, but its about time I left the nest, Casey too. All I want to do is come home from work or class to him, sit down for dinner together and talk about how our days were. My dreams aren't that complicated. All I&nbsp;want is a place to call home with him, so I can finally get him the dog he's always wanted and be able to hang out on the front porch on summer nights. Yes, the house has a front porch, I know wicked exciting right? So plan on being invited to a house warming party in let's say, August-ish.<br /><br />That's all for now, just felt the need to write. &lt;3</p>"

I started out a little bummed because I had to go up to RIC to take my math placement exam, and I hate the feeling of being a freshman all over again. I thought I was done with all of that crap last year. But thats ok. I was worried that I would totally bomb the test and have to take it again in September, but I am proud to say that I think it went well. So that put me in a good mood for the rest of the day. Had some people over for what was supposed to be a birthday cookout, ended up being a sit inside and drink margaritas party, which was excellent. My parents got me&nbsp;the backpack that I liked at EMS, so now I can start to do some serious backpacking. Yes, I am going to pack everything I need for a few days in one bag and sleep in the middle of a forest. I still need to get some more stuff, my sister got me&nbsp;a stove, but I need a lighter sleeping bag, and a tent that doesn't weigh 15 pounds. ha. I really can't wait to get out there. I've been reading this great book about backpacking and hiking, and it basically tells you what to bring and what you need to know to stay safe out there. So basically I just had a great day yesterday, with great people. And today I'm having a stay-in-your-pjs-all-day-day.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />:)</font></p>"

"event","Ok so here's the deal with life. Everything will not go your way every single day. There will undoubtedly be times when&nbsp;you are the bug and life is the shoe. But do not fret, the sun will most definitely come out tomorrow. I've learned throughout this interesting year that change cannot be stopped. September comes and you go away to school dreaming of the friends to be made and the experiences to be had. Then something happens, your room is too small, the food's not home cooked, those friends aren't like the ones at home, and then you begin to wonder why the hell you're there. You fall into this deep well of emotions, go through numerous boxes of tissue and realize that this boat is going down and the only life preserver that will save you is home. So you pack up your room and drive like a bat out of hell away from that place. You go home, spend some time with those you love and then bam, the bomb of a life time, the nuclear bomb of bombs is dropped, right onto your house. Life misktakenly throws you and your family a foul ball that hits you right in the heart. It has to be a mistake though, things like this only happen to other people, this is something you only hear about. Not true my friend, it can happen to anyone, even your own mom. So it begins to sink in, just like when you realized that home really is where the heart is, you cry, this time not alone and then you deal. Some things in life can be defeated, and this is one battle that surely will be fought like no other. You see your mom go through surgeries and treatments. You see her trying on hats and wigs. You then see her hair begin to thin, then one day you wake up and its gone. But throughout all of this, she is strong, never shedding a tear, always saying that things could be worse. So you believe her and realize that for the past six months life may have sucked, but you're still here. Everyday you have the ability to wake up and make of the day as you wish. You have the luxury of life. A life that others wish they had. So smile and remember that life goes on and there is always tomorrow. No matter how many days you're the bug, those shoe days are not so far away."

<P>Last semester I wasn't happy at all. There were times that I thought, really thought I was happy, but I wasn't, at all. I was going to try to stick it out for spring semester, and then transfer next year, but I just can't be here. All I've been doing all weekend is crying. My mom came down yesterday to calm me down and to talk things out. We decided that me coming home asap would be best for my mental health. I don't even know what I really hate about this place. Whenever I'm here, I'm not myself. I cry, I'm depressed and I've never been that kind of person before. I do not get along with 90% of the people here. Me plus&nbsp;most New Yorkers does not mix well. I'm not interested in getting drunk&nbsp;7 out&nbsp;of 7 days a week, but thats all they do here.&nbsp;Dorm&nbsp;living is not&nbsp;for me&nbsp;either.&nbsp;I need to do what will make me happy. If I spent the next three years of my life here, I would be miserable. Completely. Basically it comes down to I'm moving home tomorrow. My mom called RIC today and I can't transfer for this semester, but I might be able to take non-degree courses,GED courses, which would be better than nothing. I'm applying to work at the YMCA before school/after school program, which is right up my alley. Then next fall I'll hopefully be going to RIC and living at home. That's basically whats been happening. Hope to see everyone when I'm home.</P>

"event","<P>Yeah, so I would be lying if I said that I didn't want to go home. I'm so glad to be back, I'm back into the groove of being at school. Yet I have this nagging feeling inside. I couldn't tell you what it is, or where it is coming from, but its there and I don't like it. </P>

<P>I want this semester to be different. </P>"

"event","I'm ready to go back to school. I have so many goals and aspirations for spring semester. Fall semester was tough because all of the classes were core courses that I had to take. This semester however, I want to take these classes, well besides economics, but that is another story. Over the summer, as I was getting ready for college, shopping for dorm supplies and cleaning up my room at home, I did not think that I would last a week, let alone an entire semester at college. I grew up here, Coventry was my entire world, but there I was, septermber 4th, 2005, leaving this town for a tiny dorm room in Connecticut with big fears, but under all of that, big hopes as well. Sitting here, with only a few days left of my winter break, I'm ready to go back. I miss the friends that I have made there, and just being on campus. I'm eager to catch up with everyone, and just walk down the hall and grab people to go to dinner. College is different. Reading all of the entries on here of seniors getting accepted to college, I'm so excited for you guys. College will be the greatest experience of your lives, cliche I know, but extremely true. Do not worry about seperating from your high school friends. The ones you are meant to stay friends with you will. There will be some friends that you will lose touch with, but so is life. People leave this town and grow up and apart, just remember, quality is better than quantity, the ones that matter will stick. Its funny, I never write in this journal, but I'm glad its here for times like this."

"event","<P>So I'm really pissed.<BR>This weekend is the winter formal here at SHU. I'm not going because it was way to expensive, but my roommate is. Here's the kicker. Her boyfriend is coming up to go to the dance. But he's not just staying one night, but two. TWO nights, my last weekend on campus before break, the weekend before finals. AKA the weekend I should be locked in my room studying. No, I have been kindly asked to sleep in our friends room. Normally I would not mind. But this weekend of all weekends. A weekend I actually need to get some decent sleep. Whatever. Eleven days and I'm home. Thank god. </P>

But none of these things matter unless you have a strength of character, integrity, sense of pride. And if you have these things, don't ever sell them. Don't ever sell out. So when you meet a person for the first time, please don't judge them by their station in life.&nbsp; Because who knows, that person just might end up being your best friend."" </P>

"event","<P><BR><STRONG>Coventry</STRONG>, a large town located in <STRONG>Rhode Island</STRONG> filled with nothing but fast food restaurants, walmart, cvs, and a super stop and shop. The majority of coventry kids attend coventry high school, a recently renovated disgusting building which is filled with trailer park trash, hippies,ghetto thug wannabes, and the group of upper middle class kids who think they own the ground everyone walks on. Since there is so much to do in this town, (sense the sarcasm), everyone of those groups just named also qualify for the pothead group. Parties are usually located at Carbunkle, or at a random house in western with a woodsie backyard (although that statement pertains to almost every house in ""c-town"") Those kids who live in coventry but have attended a private school, they are the kids you used to be friends with, until they became better than you. The only time you will see these kids is at a dance, or when they are looking for one of the CHS keggers in the woods. If you live in coventry, your friends are in coventry.. no where else, people who live here dont get out much... unless ur lookin to pull a hey buddy at an out of town liquor store.</P>

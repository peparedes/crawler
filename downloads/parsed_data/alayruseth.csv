"event","I dunno, I used to try the whole 'writing out your thoughts of the moment' a few years back to try and sort out my thoughts....but I was depressed at the time, what could I really do?

No, no, I'm not depressed now! Far from it! Well, I hope anyways. I'm just trying to figure out if going back to school next year is the right thing for me to do really. I mean, as fun as being able to go places and do things I couldn't normally do while at school (which Its not as easy as I initially thought), I won't really be getting an education to better my life. I'm just wondering if Genetics is whats right for me. I tried doing the pre-med program here in town, and due to Calculus failing horribly, I'm not sure if it was the best idea for me. Hell, I might have to start off with taking my courses set up so that I can take them 2 at a time or something while still trying to work in a balance between full-time and part-time (I don't really wanna have to move back home, that was stressful enough, not that I love my dear parents, they're just crazy-stressful when I'm trying to do stuff for ME and they butt in..... mother more so than father)


Anyways, that aside, the only things other than that I have to worry about is moving out (which I'm going down to the office today when I get home to check if there are any availabilities for this month) and also getting enough OT down so that I can get my debts obliterated in time for FC (well, in time to save up money for it)"

"event","Kinda hard to believe I haven't updated this thing in over a year! ...Plus I should really change that picture, I don't remember being purple O..o;;

Anywhos, I'm at work currently, out in a little box and waiting for the last 2 hours of my shift to dissapear. I kinda wish I was staying home for halloween, but there isn't much I can do about that....

Welllll, lots have changed since my last entry here. I've moved out of my Parent's home, moved in with an awesome room-mate, ze Pagan Foxcat of awesomesauce, worked semi-hard at my job, had landlord fuckerys, obtained a new room-mate, Kyteriah (The OTHER katdragon) of coolness, and now have to move to another appartment due to previously aformentioned landlord fuckery. 


Halloween this year will be kinda teh suck. I can't really dress up at work (Again! I was working LAST year too!)

There's much to be done in recent weeks to come, like work as much OT as possible so that I can climb out of the finanical rut I've been in since FC (and should have long since crawled out of) And get my freedom to go to THIS years FC and still have the finances to move


And now.....I shall vegetate and groove to music for the next hour and a half..."

D:< Seriously, am I that bad a person? Do I hog people's attention? Do I go out of my way to annoy people? Do I destroy things with reckless abandon? Do I force people to do things against her will? Do I kill puppies? Do I never act mature? (Yes, I know I have my moments, but seriously think about that...), Am I illogical, irrational, dangerous? Am I a rapist? Am I a coked-up criminal that tags buildings and busts peoples windows? Am I a voratious killing machine? Am I a destroyer of lives, killer of familes, anihilator of worlds?


Right now, my life is so routine I've come to see that it's grown rather dull...I mean, I haven't really seen anyone due to the fact that other people are in school/college and stuffs. How is it that I seem to be seemingly destroying relationships? Or even relationships that aren't really very...uh....relationshippy? How is it that I've seemingly become so evil...sitting on my ass doing absolutely nothing half the time, and running around doing stuff for my family....is there an evil clone running around of me? Seriuosly people, quit spouting off terminal logical inexactitudes about my life and we can get back to our happy cohesion of happyness....thank you, one and all


Oh, and to those who think I've become somehow a deliberate evil-annoying-dickhead....I think I found your brain, its hiding here with me. It say your sheer denial of logic and just ranting about untruths about people has scarred it quite muchly....

Ok, on that note, 3 friends and I want to go to Edmonton for a few days, y'know, before they all have to go back to school/college/work kinda thing. We're all for it....however....

The 'rents are deadset against having 4 people (including me) in the car. They're fine with 2, and 3 is pushing it apparently, but 4 is bad. Why you ask? They're first excuse was ""We know what kids were like when we were young, and having 3 guys and a girl on a trip like that spells trouble"" 

When I assured them that we weren't about to do things like that, and how I had already had assurances from my friends that any horseshit and I would turn the boat around and sail right back on to Fort McMurray (well, drive back, but you get the picture). Then, because I started to get mad and force the issue (Like I always dumbly do) they started to change their reasoning for not letting me go from numbers-in-the-car to its-because-of-the-way-you're-acting. Granted, I can loose my cool with them in these types of situations. But Come OOOOOON! My friends and I aren't that stupid, and if my parents can't trust me worth a sac of wet paper bags.....

Serioulsy, its agrivating, I have three quarters of a mind just to drive on down to Edmonton anyways, with all 4 people aboard, JUST to show the 'rents that 
a) I'm fucking 19
b) I'm not fucking 10
c) That I can go on a small, simple vacation, and not have some sort of disaster 



Whew, ok, now that thats over with, how goes with you guys?

This morning started out all right. I woke up early (partially to reset my slowy-becoming-nocturnal sleep habit), dropped my Sis off at school, went downtown, made an appointment to meet with my academic advisor at Keyano, left there, got some breakfast, got my Slann Mage-priest from Kottage toys, went home....Mother was leaving for works soon, and I asked for her to unlock the door to the computer room....this is where I snapped. She refused. At first it was a me-being-selfish moment and demanding she open it....doing the whole childish taking-her-keys ransom thing...then, I realized. To stop myself from doing these things, I had to leave...I know I have to eventually, but recently life at home just seems...unwelcome. Unwelcome just radiates from every crack in the house, even though my parents vehemently deny that they don't want me here. I know I slack off in chores, I'm trying to get better at it....I think the only way I'm going to learn is moving out and having to do this stuff on my own. Today's episode was, by far, not the way to go. I wasted 25 bucks on a cab ride, and my Mom came to get me after I cancelled my bus ticket...

Seriously, what the fuck is wrong with me? Normal people don't go all ""HULK SMASH"" at a random annoying inncident. Do I just have rage issues or something? Or do I just seriously need to get the fuck out of this town?.....

Perhaps once I experience life living away from home I'll learn to apreciate home just a little bit more. This just might be what I need to get back into the ""I'm going to school for me"" mood, either going back to keyano or going to a different institute. Who knows what'll happen till I do, but I believe I have to step forward and do this for myself, even if it turns out to be a horrific episode or turns out to be a terrific success, I shall do this.

Number one: I drop English and Stats, and finish the year with Astronomy and Biology, and kick ass at them while I'm at it, and pass them good and done-like. Then, after that, either make sure I can get a decent wage at Superstore working full time, or Work somewhere else working full time at a decent wage, earn enough to either get a car or a new computer (I want the car, so I can travel this summer to see friends.....) and then do whatever it takes to rekindle my motivation towards self-betterment and finding what I wanna do in life....then start school again in Sept 2007.

OR


Number Two: (the one I don't like, btw). Drop everything now, take the 6 months or so to work and get my act together, and then go back to School this fall.....

I saw quite a few people that, even though related, I have such a vauge recolection of. Needless to say, I had a great time talking to all the people there, catching up on things (even if a few of the people I talked to didn't hear half the things I said to them). I was quite amazed at how many people seem to see such awesome potential in me. Apparently my ambitions in things like videography aren't so farfetched a dream as I thought (Which is why I may consider taking such courses at the U of Calgary....maybe, we shall see in the coming year). At any rate, we ate, were merry (and slightly drunk, in my case, had a few glasses of champaign I's did) , and celebrated my Great Aunt's life so far with much zeal. I even, to my parents initial horror, stood up to say a few words. According to them I have a history of doing something stupid when infront of a crowd like that, but I much pleased them when all I did was say a few thoughtful and artisticly chosen words. Needless to say, they now think me a bit more mature than the son that used to just go up there and do something incredibly goofy in a ""Look at me"" fasion....

I feel, and I have parental (at least one of them) support on this too to drop them, and finish Bio and English.... I'm probably going to take some other courses next semester besides the chem ones, ....well, only 1 other course, and take the other Bio course.....and continue english....so only three courses next semester....yays! 

This is just something to keep me occupied, I guess, so that I'm at least learning something....my parents feel as long as I'm going to school, its all good. Now I can also earn some more money on the side. So...yeah....well, if anyone wants to call me, please do, I'm a bit lonely.... 'course those who usually call me on weekends or for weekends need not apply, buecause you's will call anyways..I hope XD

So, school is good. and I think the course line up will be English (for I can't drop it) , Bio 108 and Astronomy... sounds good to me!

I mean, drifting away when neither party contacts is another, but ignoring you?............No attempt at communication; its like I'm not even there..... I mean, just because I either go to a different school now, or am not calling 24/7, doesn't mean I don't exsist.....


I notice that, while in past years I was sorta semi-asked to birthday parties, I only got 1 this year out of the 3 I knew happened within the last month and a half..... so, yeah, not wanted by them anymore

"event","Ok...I seriously can't wait to get the frick outa school. Its caused me enough stress as it is. And then, believed or not folks, My Mom started yelling at me last night about my marks, as if I wasn't depressed for a majority of the semester. I seriously tried the best I could considering, and she's all like, Doom-and-gloom-you-failed-at-life .....yeah, great vote o' confidance there Mom > . >

Well, on the upside, I'm almost done my scrapbook, almost done the classes (its just review now), and I have 1 and 1/2 exams this week....blarg, I seriously need to see the Math teachers soon for review...and start talking to Drew about Math and Social review......like holy frig!

Chemistry and Physics I'm less worried about, though I still am.

....Oh lovely, just took a peak outside the library window, and its pooring again... hehe, that reminds me, I need to learn how to cast fire spells so I can dry out my friend in Calgary...hehe

Not much else I can put, 'cept for the small fact that I got into another accident (Toootally not my fault...) I got rear ended by some lady who thought I was going through the yellow light....which was yellow for a bout a second > . >....genious lady

So yeah, Animethon = look for alternative transportation

"event","OMGWTFSQUEE! Apple got my iPod yesterday, and sent me a convenient automated e-mail to tell me so. Now that I know its there, I can wait with peace of mind......well, for a while at least

OMGWTFSTRESS!!! > . < School = Death. Seriously, I'm going to go cwazy by the end of my last test and, hopefully, can still go to Animethon depending on the outcome of these tests. Also, hopefully, I can have a social life (I had one? :| ) at the end of exams again. This year, it seams, whenever I tried to have fun with my friends while balancing school, something happened to throw it all arse over tea kettle. Not to mention that it would be best to avoid my friends anyways right now, at least the ones I know in school and that live in Fort Mac. They tend to get uber-bitchtastic around exams and become mangy, slobbering beasts when I talk to them during this time, so with best interests about my physical health at heart, I'll be in seclusion untill the end of this time period

And now, the lowdown on the car. If anyone knows how to tune-up cars (prefferably for free!), My car makes very odd rattling sounds when it runs.....Hopefully, for the love of all things holy, does not die on us going to Animethon. Also, if someone would please remind me to call local auto-shops about Air Conditioning refueling, my car needs it. Only problem is it uses Freon, yes, that lovely CFC. Normally I wouldn't like this, but, between saving about 10,000 molecules of Ozone and the comfort of 3 other passengers and myself, I'd choose comfort.

OMGWTFIDONTCARE!!!! Ok, people that say ""Oh, Macs suck"" or, ""Why do you play World of Warcraft, (insert MMORPG here) is much better than it"", bug the crapola out of me. Seriously, I don't care that such-and-such game is better. I like playing WoW, I like Macs, I like playing and using what I play and use, so Stop....saying....those....things!....And its not like I don't like other games anyways. I like FFXI, its just that it get complicated for me to play it during school days because I either
a) have to drag a TV and the PS2 upstairs to my room to play, or
b) beg and plead to my Dad to return my 50ft Ethernet cable which I swore I rolled up (The basement ghost hooked it up again....either that, or I was sleepwalking when I left for bed :\)


OMGWTFINFOPLEEEEZE!!!! The reason that I ask certain things of people, about people, or request more information than people want to tell me is this. I like making informed decisions so that, if I get it wrong, at least I have the information to correct my wrongs. I hate opening my mouth on a matter, and having something blow up in my face because I didn't know something is frustrating. Its because sometimes people expect you to be psycic, which I am soooo not. Mind you, sometimes I need to keep my mouth shut, but sometimes I seriously need to say something........well, you know the jist.


Holy crap, biggest blog ever!.....well, not really, but big for me

P.S. OMGWTFIOVERUSETHIS!"

Well, for the most part, I'm sick with the iPod I have. Yeh, Fort Mac weather killed the battery mostly, but its sporadically crashing and failing on me, and its just...not in good shape in general, so what I'm going to do is sell it to my father for 100 bucks and then get the top-oh-the-line iPod Photo....plus I guess I'm going to have to buy the firewire cable and dock to it too, since now they don't ship them with them anymore...ah well... ^^ I'll hopefully be able to still use my Voice recorder and iTrip for it....

Anyways, thats pretty much it...> . < damnit, I need more exciting things to happen to me...not bad things, just more excitement...speaking of :\ I feel sorta bummed out that I haven't had a decent RP, vore or not, for the past long while....sorta, yeah, bummed at that...

Ah well, its a new vehicle, and I'm glad its not made by Microsoft > . >

The car? Oh, yes, a '90 Chevy Cavalier.... Retro-like.... God, its hard to believe that something like that can still drive, its incredible to me. However, its probably used a few good replacement parts here and there, and it was amusing to my friend and I earlyer tonight on how to turn on the headlights, and find the wipers....Meh, I'll figure that car out soon

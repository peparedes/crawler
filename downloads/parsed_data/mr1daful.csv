"event","ok, so winter track is over already... we ended the season great! we were 5th in the section, which is REALLY good, but they only took 3 to the states... so maybe next year... but it was fun. SPRING TRACK starts in 2 weeks and i'm kinda excited, i'm gonna ""run"" for captain (haha) and hope i get voted in. my ENTIRE relay team will be GONE! :( its so sad, i made so many friends this season, what will i do without them?? its so sad that its all over, i never thought i would have had so much fun? oh well, i'm looking forward to spring, hope we get some good runners, but as of now i have a couple ideas for my relay, and who's gonna help me get to states ;)"

( i still wanna go!) but i guess that will just make us run better in the afternoon. i cant really do much 2day... gotta keep resting, and stretching my legs, i hope they dont cramp up during the race again... and my hair is so short! i dont like it. but i'm more excited then nervous now!"

"event","ok wtf, kaitlin is being a REAL bitch now... but w/e i dont really care. she wrote all this crap on her jounal about friday night, but she doesn't even know the whole story. yea its true, i found new best friends, jose is not the only one, i have so much more fun with my other friends than i do with her and all i do when i'm arround her is get forced into saying, ""sure i'll come and smoke with you"" but i usually dont want to. so friday night, i was dreading the whole week, because it was all about going with kailin and liana and tom to go smoke and drink... (sorry if ur too much of a loser of your own, i dont NEED to smoke OR drink to have fun) and then i made up this shit lie that practice ends at about 6, that day it ended like 4:30, and we stayed in the gym to watch the bball game. finally 6 rolls around, and liana and kaitlin show up at school like theyre stalking me or somthing, and as soon as they show up me and jose go change in the locker room. we were in there like... wtf i dont wanna go with them, so we made up (another lie... #2) this excuse that i needed to go home, and still theyre like... SMOKE WITH US. and we're walking back from my locker, to the lobby or somewhere, and kaitlin yells out of nowhere, ""fine, jose can come too (wonder who gave her that idea... what a load of BS). w/e i knew i was going out that night anyways, i just didn't know where or with who. so after i finally leave school lke 6:45, i run some errands, and then get back home at like 8ish... this is where the real fun began! i get home and i call jose and he's like lets just go and get some stuff from them, after all, they said i could have some. so he show's up at soundview theater at like 9ish, and calls me and tells me to go there too, and i show up at around 9:30. we go into the movie theater without a ticket and we're in the movie, (would been good to stay... free movie! but i didn't want to) and jose askes for some beer, of course kaitlin gives him stuff... and then i'm like w/e lets leave. so kaitlin is bitchin about how i should stay blah blah blah i wasn't paying attention, we said we were gonna go to jose's house and then to mine for a pasta party with other people, and i'm like... if jose gets stuff, y can't i? so i ask her for some weed, and she flips out on how i never do n e thing with her anymore (true, i never did want to) and refuses to give me any, yet brags about how much she has. w/e i dont really care, so me and jose start to walk, and kaitlin doesn't know how to take a hint and goes to return her ticket and follows us... on the way to stop and shop jose has his beer, and i wanted somthing to do, so i asked again and some other times...we finally get to stop and shop, i'm like... THANK GOD, so we ran away from kaitlin to go find ""jose's mom"" and kaitlin was gone! BUT!!!! thats mostly what she know... (keep reading)*back track* before i showed up at soundview, jose called me and said we'll get stuff and go... to the movies ... with other people... fun people. he said we would say we were going to a pasta party at my house for the track meet coming up... and we'd leave them at the movies at soundview, and walk to mainstreet and meet everyone else... PERFECT!only, we didn't know kaitlin would walk with us, so we made up another bullshit lie (#3) that jose's mom was coming...RIIIIIGHT... steve picked us up infront of the store! we drove down to main street theatre and met everyone else, we went ans saw BOOGEYMAN (scary as hell) and had a rocking time. so, yea... the whole night was a lie (#4,5,6,7,8...2000), call me a fuckin bastard all you want, i dont realy care, i have other friends who TRULY care about me, and they act like it too, and i have a good time with all of them, WITHOUT smoking or drinking. AAAAND after that night (fun as hell) i came home to an IM from her saying how mean i am and how much she cared... blah blah blah its all crap... this is just for you kaitlin: next time you wanna diss me with all that crap, say it to my face, so i know thats how u really feel, if u were so pissed the whole time u shoulda said somthing, put your shit on the table and say it like it is... and trust me... the friends i have now wont be ditching me in this lifetime hun. as for the whole not friends anymore, i dont care, in the past few weeks all the posts and IMs saying ""i miss you"" and ""we never talk"" and ""glad your having fun"" they were annoying... and yea, i was having fun... LOTS of fun"

"event","here's the new low... track first cuz thats all all my mind right now... last friday the 28th we ran probably our most competative 4x200meter relay, with me matias matt and pasquale... while running i was cut off by Laurence (those f-ers) and then when our anchor was catching up to them, about to pass them, he goes flying into the floor, Laurence tripped him (THOSE F-ERS). so i was basically depressed for the whole weekend because i thought that that was our only way to make it to counties.. but i was wrong :) we made it to counties for our 4x400 relay!! so now me and jose get to go 2gether, YAY (i dont know what i woulda done without him this season) so now we get to go to countie and compete againt the best of Nassau County! valentine's day is coming fast... what will i get you... or better yet, what will you get me?"

The first couple of days i was too shy to talk to anyone, i thought you would all hate me! I never went to the teen clubs bc i didn't know where to go. but i eventually played pool with charlo, my first friend... how wierd!i guess with him , we went to play b-ball with scott and lewis, and some other people i don't remember. that was the day of the dance, that i was too shy to go in, bc i thought you'd all hate me. after that day, i was till roaming around, looking for the two friends, i had made... it didn't work. i finally saw a bunch of teens go down to the arizona pool, i followeed them there, and didn't really know anyone. i saw scott and bryan going to play some basketball, so i followded them and we played 21. i got to 21 points, but their rules were i had to make another fouls shot, and then an icebreaker...? i never could... so we just got bored and went down to the french pool (the rich one) and i met a bunch of people. i met ash, ashley allie and james for the first time. i saw a bunch of other people, i just can't remember their names. the next day, i did the same thing, roam around and looked for people. i found ashley later, we hung out the whole day until the night, when we got kicked out of the arizona pool , for breaking the bottle of alcohol... opps... i waited for ashley to go back to her room, and then went down to the french pool, i met kate for the first time... WOW... and sebastian and lewis, they probably dont remember me... we hung out for a bit, then i left cause everyuone else did.  the next day was the first good day!! i met ashley in the  morning, THANK GOD, then we met kate and ummm... i think mike...?we speant the whole day 2gether, it was great, we bonded. TRUTH OR DARE THAT NIGHT WAS AWESOME!! but i cant really say anything, what happened on the island stays on the island, until we move it to the main land, when we meet again! I have to say, i finally told this group of people a BIG SECRET that NOBODY ELSE KNOWS!!! to my suprise, i wasn't the only one :) the next day we bonded some more... 10 fingers, truths, some stripping... and more hot tubbing!! later that day, i met some HOTTIE 13 yr olds, Tess and Amy!! the next day, was more bonding, and a crappy VMA party at my place... it was ok, some cool dancing... plus my parents werent there... and kate got in my boxers... (nothing dirty) :)that was my last night there :'( but after the party we went down to the french pool, played truth or dare, and had the funniest sloppy seconds kiss eva!!:-* I also learned to pole dance, at the childrends playset... i did hear some shit-talk flyin in my direction... Tess you know what i mean, Amy should too. Does he think i'm def? THE LAST DAY!!! i bought kate a neclace/bracelet/anklet matching set early in the morning. I remember her saying she liked to wear black, so i thought it was black and white... but me being the retard that i am, it was blue and white... oh well... i hope she liked it.I CRIED LIKE A    F-ING BABY!! I LOVE YOU GUYS SOOOOO MUCH, i'll miss you until we meet again, and when its over i'll cry again :) i honestly couldn't deal without you guys. the WHOLE 10hr ride home i cried.. like HORRIBLE CRYING, i literally went into cunvulsions while crying... :) see you guys soon"

Anyways, i did really well on my piano final on monday. which was a relief...&nbsp;he said i should get between an A or an A- in the class. no complaints there.
My business final tomorrow is going to absolutely suckkkkk. 100 multiple choice, 2 essays. errrr.&nbsp;

I haven't updated in forever so i figured i might as well update now.
I've been here for over a month now, and its pretty much a love hate relationship we have. college and i that is.
My roommate is good shit. we're not like best friends, but we're chill together.
My quadmates, thats another story.&nbsp;
My floormates, eh.
But i pretty much met the coolest person everrrr, miss katie flynn.
we'ze tight.
But yeah i mean i met a decent amount of people and i'm meeting more and more people as the weeks progress!&nbsp;
I loveeeee justin and josh. my two fave guy friends, obv.
But yeah, anywayyyy.
Jeremy and I are FABULOUS! The distance sucks, YEAH. but i mean, we're making it work and the weekends we spend together are fucking the best ever.
I miss him SO MUCH right now. He's coming here thursday thoughhhhh. and my birthday is on FRIDAY!!!
IM me if you want my mailing address so ya know, you can send me fabulous cards.
My parents are coming up saturday for parents weekend, it'll be funnn. They are going ot take Jer and I out for dinnerrr :D
Birthday dinners are the best.
I really do love jeremy though, sooo much. The most time we spend away from eachother is 11 days, and yeah its the worst 11 days of my life. But when ifinally get to see him its the best feeling in the world.
Its pretty sweet, it costs me 45 dollars for a roundtrip to see him, not bad at all.
I feel like i live in oswego, haha. So when i'm there i get to see a lot of people from my highschool which is weird.&nbsp;
It feels like i got to two different colleges.&nbsp;
Buhhh! I had my first mid-term today. and it was HISTORY. worst ever!! but after taking it, in all honestly, i could potentially get an 80. and for the midterm. fuck yeah i'll take that grade.
My history teacher is probably annoyed with me. I email him like everyday and go to his office hours every week. hahah, i just want him to know me and know tha ti'm trying so i can pass. :D
Oh well!&nbsp; I'm peacing out.
I have a test tomorrow at 9.... yeah thats less than 8 hours away, PEACE!!"

My uncle also passed away recently. monday March 26th.
I saw a lot of relatives i've never even met before.
he had cancer... he was only in his 40's. but the doctors couldn't do anything more about it either.
And well.. My great aunt just passed away today... monday april 2nd.&nbsp;
she had alzeimers and just refused to eat/drink anymore. she just gave up.
All mondays.
i've lost three relatives in the past 4 weeks.

i realized that the idea we were going with, made no sense.
and i came up with a sick theory that would be way better to use.
i'm making my poster with my sick theory, and i could care less what my group says.

wait what was your average in highschool? what college did you attend? haha where are you currently living?

it was pretty sweet.
our team right now is tied with them 3-3.
care and meg are still playing... it got too dark to finish the match.
they are up one set and in their second score its 4-3? i believe.
they have to go back to homer to finish it. and that will determine the match.
after the match angel, meg, and hanna all came over and stayed the night :)
we made a myspace for hanna and she showed us the ""swedish myspace""
yesterday i worked for 2 hours and today is my last day.
we went to the drive-in last night it was funnn.
i drove the van and andy, angel, meg, and amanda rode with me.
we met up with jeremy and hanna and some others as well.
i pretty much had an amazing time, because i have an amazing boyfriend. obv.&nbsp; :)
this week is going to be super busy...
we have a match monday, tuesday, and friday.
eek."

single parents,

amaze me.&nbsp;
and i just always feel like i have this weird connection with them,
because i know damn well.. that i was a mistake in my birth mothers eyes.
i'm turning eighteen soon..
that means i could start looking for my real parents if i wanted to..
i just feel like i should find my real mom, and find out why she gave me up...
its stupid i know.
no one can really understand that,

it was kind of my last weekend to party,
because well... tennis started today. so that means more things added to schedule, and tennis is normally in the morning.
but saturday night was fun.
sunday morning was amazinnggg. 
hah :)
tennis today wasn't that bad at all,
especially since i didn't play at all this summer.
and i got a new raquet.&nbsp;
i realized this morning that i guess i'm ready for school to start up again.
senior year and all...
i know i will regret saying that after the first week,
but whateva.&nbsp;
i have five lawns to mow this week...
and i'm not sure when i'm going to do that...
possibly i'll mow some today.
i was going to take a nap,
but i might as well run myself down into the ground so i can sleep tonight.
and then of course get up at ten again for tennis.
i think my favorite song right now is ""reassemble"" by the honorary title.
not really sure why, but its good stuff.
i'm at a high point in my life right now,
and i'm happier than ever.&nbsp;"

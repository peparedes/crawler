"event","WOW...OK...its been a little over two years now~i cant believe i still have this account...well here we go on emy life story in the past 2 years...

2003:(finishing up that year)i think where i last left off i wasnt to sure what me and benjamin were. well we went ""together"" for a good six months. then i got grounded and he aint want the relationship anymore. well i was hurt of course. but i did get over it. then next year in high school which was my sophmore year...me and ashley got into an argument over ryan cuz ryan is so bad and he NEver did n e thing for her...(SIKE) and then this gurl besty came along and she caused a BUNCH of drama...i ended up fighting her at school and got suspended adn then got hit bby a bus the fallowing week..that was in october...it was down right crazy...i met this other gurl named ashley sargent..she surfs and is pretty cool...

2004: well then me and ashley sargent started to hang out alot and in the summer i stayed at her house cuz my grandma was sick...i stayed with her mom and we just chilled...it was all good....until around november of that year we met a guy named sean...who caused alot of shit to happen...i liked him and so did she...he picked me and she was mad and then that ended are BEST freind thing we had goign on...whcih sucked but it was kinda like whatever...then i was on the swim team and this gurl didnt make it all that easy to be on it though, she like had the hole wim team hating me...

NOW 2005: well i started to hang out with these boys named Richie John Morgan Wade and Marcus...THe drama u think has started...hasnt even compared to this...I had a thing for john big time...although i didnt no if he felt the same way or not so i sorta like went out with marcus. but after i found out he did...i broke up with marcus for john...thne richie came in the picture. i really think...ill wroite another one later...at work sp its sorta hard to get into detail, later on"

                          Wondering...
i sit here in my room, wondering about you, wondering what we could have been, woundering why you had to use me, wondering why it just had to be! i came up with one conclusion...its all beacause you had to used me! i want you still, i love you, but i will NEVER take you back! i know you still like me and have feelings for me, because when t am with another guy you get mad and wont talk to me form the hole day! but then you are going out with my WORST enemy! i wounder why you act like this, i wounder why you still like me and i still love you, even though you put me through so much and hurt me so bad! you where me 1st pastionate kiss... i will never forget that night! never...and i will never forget the day after, me wondering and worring about if you had used me or not. i will never forget... i will never forget that day i found out that you had just used me...it felt like so much mor, or thats how i felt anywayz... i wonder after all you put me through...i still want you!i will never have you!, because i will never let myself have you...i might act like everything iz ok...but it really isn't. it will never be ok! i wont let it be ok!i wonder why it hurt me so much, i wonder why youdid it, i wonder what i everdid to deserve this much pain...i wonder why i love you...i wounder why i cried over you...and never told a soul! i dont care how much i try,i cant stop loving you! you are on my mind when i am with some one better then you, you are in my dreams, you are the one i kiss, even when it really isn't you. you run all over my mind, you run all over my heart and soul! and after all that, you act like nothing is wrong and everything is ok...but i wonder, is there anything wrong with you? how you like hurting me and dont even know it? i wonder about alot of things, but the most thing i wounder about, iz you...

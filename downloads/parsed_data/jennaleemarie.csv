"event","a short re-cap of my christmas vacation thus far:
crashed my car on the way home last week, had christmas with the relatives, got bored really fast, came back to river falls, got the flu, laid in bed for two days all by myself. what fun there is to be had. rage. oh, and me and my friend jake went to mall of america the other day. big big mistake my friends. too many people, too short of a temper on my part. never again i say. never.

on a good note, my mom and dad got me seasons 1,2, and 3 of seinfeld on dvd. oh how fabulous. i am going to see travis today too finally.

so after i crashed my car and the whole ordeal was taken care of, me and dad went car shopping. i got a 2000 grand am se, 4-door. it kicks ass. i do enjoy. i better be careful with this one. ethan must test drive it when he comes to visit. yes yes.

toodles for now."

"event","one final down, three to go. and they're gonna blow asshole folks. but whatevs. and does it also blow asshole that i have lost all motivation to study and do good on these last exams? yes, it does blow asshole. but i just don't care anymore. i should really try to calculate my transfer gpa to boost my self esteem cause i kicked ass at scsu and here.....not so much. whatevs. 

i feel like i need to get out of here. i wish i would have transferred to the U in the first place before coming to river falls. i looked into the U, but found they had no social work dept. but then, what major does my friend mike transfer into at the u? SOCIAL WORK. WHAT THE FUCK. I AM GONNA KILL SOMEBODY. IF NOT SOMEBODY THAT GOD DAMN GOPHER. RAGE.

so to get out of here, i may go to new york with my good pal jake in may when we are done with school for. we must save money. if not, we will go to chicago instead which would also be fun. my tiny dad will not like the idea of me going to either city but oh well. bless his little tiny dad heart.

i still haven't gone grocery shopping. i meant to go three weeks ago. not even exaggerating. three whole weeks ago. i have no bread, no cereal or anything. i have lived off of oatmeal, granola bars, and cinnamon applesauce. but since i haven't eaten good food in forever i have lost appetite for everything. whatevs. i may go shopping tomorrow.

oh my goodness. i was informed of a song from the movie ""world police"". i think it is called ""America: Fuck yeah!"" you need to find it and download it.........immediatley. funniest thing ever.

over break it will also rule because the only ones staying here in the house are me and my two favorite roomates. holla for that. i will have the whole upstairs to myself! woo hoo. 

i wish i would have transferred to the U in the first place before coming to river falls. i want to go there so bad now, but if i transfer i'm thinking i'm never gonna graduate. rage. so now i am stuck in this poopy town at this poopy school when i am aching to be in the cities. at least in the summer ethan is moving here from green bay and we will rock it out in st. paul. we will have a ghetto apartment with retro furniture from good will. it should be fun times. i miss ethan :-( too far away. rage. must go to denny's.

so maybe i must re-cap on my fabulous weekend in green bay. friday morning i picked my friend ashley up in minneapolis and we then headed to green bay to suprise ethan for his birfday. ethan knew ashley was coming, but not me, so i reckon he was excited to see us there. friday night~ olive garden. good stuff i might add. then, saturday we went to pick up the other part of our posse, nick. we had fun during the day, then that night we drank some rootbeers and smoked a little pot. fun times. then sunday was poony cause me and ashley had to head back to MN. oh well, twas fun indeed.

so 4 weeks left of the semester folks!!! i am fucking excited as hell. 

um....if anyone didn't happen to catch the timberwolves' performance tonight. WTF??? they blowed ass. whatevs. i still love em!

friday, my friend travis and i might go to the wolves game. lower-deck i might add. i will die if we get to go. die.

"event","who ever invented the word cripes rules. it takes virtually no effort to say and it just fits into so many contextual aspects. wow. 

so it's been quite awhile since i've written. i have no time and i don't know why. i think most of it is that i have enough time to get stuff done. but then my A.D.D. kicks in and it takes me 3 times longer to get stuff done than it should. so i must work on that.....

good news: i put in my 2 week notice at galyans today, and it felt damn good. at first i wasn't sure if i would regret it or not, but then when i went back to my register and people started pissing me off royally again, i knew i had made the right call. so my last day will be november 30 and it will kick some ass.

in the mean time, i have applied at borders books. if i get to work there i will crap my pants because i simply love books. and i'm thinking that maybe smart people will shop there, instead of the fucks that come into galyans wanting to return  A YEAR-OLD PAIR OF SHOES. WHAT THE FUCK PEOPLE. RAGE. on a side note: this was an online application which required me to fill out one of those personality/psychotic analysis tests. they ask such questions as, "" do you prefer to be alone?"" or  ""do you often get angered by people?"" needless to say.........i had to lie on a few of those questions.........

ethan visited me on his way back to green bay on saturday!! there was a minor incident with my car involving no gas, but we won't get into that. ethan saved my car. we went to perkins and both got the grilled fish dinner thing. wow, that was very tasty. 

the timberwolves games have not been airing in river falls. if this continues to happen, i just might have to kill someone.

my last individual speech is tomorrow. i just wrote it in one hour's time. but i think it will kick ass. this class didn't turn out to suck as bad as i thought it would.

well, toodaloo for now. who knows when i'll write again."

i just completed a midterm. very easy i must say. however, i have another one tomorrow. and have i begun to prepare for it yet? nope. and it is gonna suck ass because this professor is actually intelligent and uses big words. i am fucked.

so today i work from 11-7. not too thrilled about that. i also work thurs. through sunday which is really gonna bite. but i am getting paid so whatevs. i must save money. i so have halloween weekend off too which will rule. i may drive to green bay that weekend to visit with some certain someones, but then again, my tiny dad may not like that idea of my car and 10 hours of driving. we'll see.......

an old man peed his pants in galyans last week. 

you know what is crazy about fall and the leaves changing? for me it is so crazy that those colors that are so vibrant are found in nature and are not manufactured. and looking at those colors where you used to seeing green is like when you look at a piece of neon-colored paper in the morning. it like fucks with your eyes for a second because it is so bright. it is just kick ass that the leaves can be yellow and red, and that flowers can be all kinds of colors too. it is crazy. how's that for a stoner-esque thought?

i feel like all of my classes, homework, work, meetings, and everything else is all jumbled around in my head and unorganized causing my head to hurt quite often. i need a personal assistant i think. fo shizzle.

tonight i went to a cookout thing at my friend jon's house. it was pretty kick ass. they have various fish tanks around the house, and in one bowl they had a shrimp! they said you couldn't even tell it was in the bowl unless you saw it's eyes cause the body is clear. so they were looking for it to show me, and it was dead. how tragic. it was freaky looking. note to ethan: NO PETS. EVER. RAGE. ok. however, it is pretty sad when a house full of guys keeps there house cleaner than me and the girls here. oh well.

well folks, the berretta is getting worse by the day now. it is not good at all. i don't want to tell my dad though! i feel bad and he may be salty about me getting a new car before summer. if i do have to get a new car i will have to take next semester off to work and such. whatevs.

"event","blaaahhhhhhh. the day is nearing its end and i'm tired. today was actually a good day for me! i must tell everyone this: i got a perfect speech exam score which i am excited about. then, i got another one of my speeches out of the way today. so that was good. very good.

my next speech is an informative speech, so if anyone has any ideas, shoot.

me and nicholle went to dance tonight, like every monday. for the past few weeks we were learning a routine to Black Eyed Peas' ""Get Retarded"" or whatever it's called. but today we started a new routine, and it is to Usher's ""Yeah"". that kicks ass. our teacher is like 40 i think, and she is like cher. long black hair, tan, and crazy makeup. and damn can she move. i bet she goes to the clubs too. her and her fortyness. kick ass. there is one boy in our class out of like 20 and i feel bad for him cause lots of the moves are designed for girls. so when we 'get low', he kind of makes up his own stuff. funny. and fuckin' tamyka goes to dance too. 

hot damn. i calculated my hours for this next month, and by the end of october, i will have enough money saved up to go to new york. YESSS! so then i will save the rest for a car i beleive. that should make my dad happy.
 
speaking dad........I CAN'T WAIT TO GO HOME ON WEDNESDAY!!!! mom always lets me request dinner so she is making tacos. i am excited to see my brother a lot too and my mom. yay yay yay.

you know what i've been thinking about lately? i don't even know if i can explain this.....but here goes.
what if the world, and the universe is completely different than we think it is. we think we are all hot shit in our world, all technologically advanced and shit. but do you have any idea how many other worlds there are out there that i'm sure have life on them. there could be another sun out there that we don't even know about. that is crazy fucked up stuff to ponder upon. and there could be beings that aren't humans, but that are just as, or more advanced than us. millions of years ahead of us. there are so many things in our world that are just theories. we just believe in them because there is no other way to explain them they just are. like gravity and shit. okay, this may not be making any sense to anyone, but oh well. just think about it.........

me and ethan are moving to st.paul next year!!!!!!! woo hoo. i am excited about that. i like river falls, but i get sick of the people. having such little diversity really blows.

on a side note, me and nicholle bought guys' basketball shorts today. they go past our knees. we look ghetto. it is great."

i simply must get home once this week to have dinner with the folks. i miss my brother a lot too :-( i think i will have to go home wednesday night, skip thursday class, and then come back thursday after noon to work. yay.

so i've been reading the paper lately and paying a lot more attention to world news and such. my conclusion: this world sucks and we are all killing ouselves. and you know what i really think now? that if there was such a ""loving god"" and all, why the hell would it wait for things to get so bad and unbearable around the world for it to ""come back and save us all from sin"". i'm sorry, but fuck that. it just sounds like a load of shit to me. i'm not saying my life sucks so bad, but for some people that have it so bad, and if they believe in god, i feel bad that god has not come to save them or whatever. if that's what they believe. dammit, the world is just gonna die someday soon.

so one of my roomate's mom just called and told her that her grandpa has cancer and she is not taking it well. this is her first time having such a close family member get seriously ill and i feel terrible for her. i just hope she will be ok and all.

also, ethan, i am sorry and i hope you are ok.
rest in peace super selma.

okay, my running total for dropped classes thus far in the semester is 2. yeah, i don't know what the hell is wrong, but i guess 4 classes is all i can handle this semester with work and rugby and stuff. speaking of rugby, i went to practice yesterday for the first time cause i've been to busy to go otherwise; but anyway, we ended up scrimmaging with the guys' team. they smoked us, but it was fun anyways. the horrible tragedy of it all is that i saw this really really scrawny kid's balls.......AGAIN. yes, again. i saw them last year in a game, and i told him he should maybe wear boxer briefs or something to prevent that from happening again. well, no. he was wearing no underwear whatsoever and i saw his balls. i wanted to cry.

well, i don't know how many people believe in karma, but i swear it is real! in some form or another it is real folks. for example, my friend alli who i go to school with here in river falls and whom i also went to high school with told me about her ""bike stories"" on friday. i won't get into the nature of her ""stories"", but needless to say i laughed and made fun of her for them. so what happens tuesday morning? i get into a little ""bike story"" myself. it is just me and this one other girl on the sidewalk. as i approach her going up this hill, her back being turned away from me, she decides for no known reason that she is going to suddenly step to the left. needless to say, i ran into this girl on my bike. i felt bad and said sorry. then i said fuck you to karma. dammit karma! why you gotta be like that?! *said in ghetto voice*

i got swoobs today riding my bike. it is too hot out today. fall must come NOW. and as much as i miss snowboarding, i am not looking forward to winter, and walking to class freezing my ass off. 

i am giving another speech next week. i am going to kill everyone.

on a side note, i'm sure we all know of a house somewhere where they think that it's okay to hang undergarments on the clothes line. no, it's not ok. exhibit A: my neighbor's yard which is right out my window and is also in clear view of an apartment building and 4 other houses. they hang tighty whities on their line, and even socks. seriously! put the tshirts on the line, and put the underwear and socks in the dryer! spare us all your shame. please.

okay, time to use my last hour before work for something...........though i'm not sure what. holla."

so there is a big rugby tournament in blaine this weekend that i was gonna play in and i was super excited, but i have too much homework to do so now i can't go which makes me want to rage just a little. i guess work and school will leave no room for rugby this semester. maybe in the spring.......

so i have pretty much forgotten my past days' events, but i basically went to class, and that's it so yeah. last night me and my old roomate nicholle went to minneapolis to take a hip-hop dance class. it was crazy. kind of hard, but fun. another thing that was crazy was that i saw Tamyka Martina!! tamyka is from the dorms at scsu and i guess she transferred to st. thomas so that was insane that i saw her there. 

cripes, i give my first speech on friday. it is only 2-3 minutes long, and it is 'telling a story'. she said we could use something somebody else has written, or something we wrote. i took some parts of a story from a book that i just read called ""A Million Little Pieces"" by James Frey. this book was fucking amazing. it is james's true story of his 6 weeks in drug rehab. it is way way good, and the whole book is so poetic and profane, and dirty, and just real. so if anyone wants to borrow it i'll let you! but anyways, i am doing my speech on james's story of when he went to the dentist while in treatment. since he is going through detox and whatnot, he of course could not have any pain killers or any substances of any kind. so i will post an entry with the speech i am reading on it cause it kicks ass and everyone will gasp because i am saying ""fuck"" in my speech. god forbid....."

ok now, off that subject, my classes are all going quite well, and much better than i had anticipated. lets start of with literature: although i have to read many diffucult books such as othello, maus, the great gatsby, etc., my professor is simply fabulous. he has that dorky, quirky, sense of humor about everything which i love and i stay entertained. there will be a fair amount of work in that class, but nothing i can't handle. next is stats: for this class, i have the same professor that i had for intro. to psych and she really isn't the funnest teacher ever, but i can tell she enjoys teaching stats better than intro. to psych so she isn't too dull this year. and since this class is sandwiched between literature and social work 205, i am prohibited from skipping her class as much as i did last year, so it works well i spose. next, social work 205: i have the best professor ever, ogden rogers. he is just so refreshing because he swears, and makes profane comments and suggestions. i love that about him; he is so out of the box. the class should be fabulous. speech: i was dreading this class immensly, but it has turned out to be one of my favorite classes. the professor is fabulous. we work in groups a lot, and we do activities which makes learning so much better, and makes the whole idea of giving speeches not so bad. my assigned group for the semester could not be better. i am with a mother of three, a crazy physics major, and this other crazy girl. we all mesh so well together because we are basically all insane and different. so i am thrilled. my other social work class is alright so far and i have heard is an easy A, and then my phy ed. classes are super super easy. so there. sorry to bore you with that, but i am just relieved about my classes!

dammit, on my way to classes and when i am out and about on campus so far, i have seen just about everyone that i remember from last year. however, there is one boy who i haven't seen that is the most severe hottie ever!! so jenna will rage until i see him.

today i will venture to the mall of america with last year's roomate nicholle. that shall be fun. me and nicholle hang out just about every day which is cool cause we both like to eat and watch tv, burp, etc. go nicholle.

one last installment here......this saturday i am visiting ashley in the cloud!! i am excited. i will be back in sherburne hall. it will be crazy. i hope ashley is adjusting okay and everything now that her roomate isn't being a poon-berry. 

peace out."

"event","this morning i am riding my bike to class, however i am a bit frightened by it. to get it here in my car, i had to take of the front wheel. a.k.a.: jenna took of a bunch of parts and didn't know exactly how to put them back together. so the wheel is back on as of yesterday, and it seems okay, but i can just picture myself cruising down a hill and having my front wheel fall off. not cool. so i will report later on what goes down with that. this weekend is my last days at the corn roast and i am kinda glad. i am getting paid good, but i got worn out from working there every day for 12 hours. i think i have an interview at galyan's next week, so i hope i get  a job there cause that store kicks major ass. it is for ritzy bitches, but i will make them buy things and i will get paid. holla. yesterday was my first day of class and everything went good. today i have 4 classes. yikes. but oh well. i just hope i survive the heat and sweaty armpits for today."

"event","okay, i have been home for the past couple of days because i wanted to hang out with my friends from home some more before everyone goes back to school. one of those days we saw the excorcist movie in the theatres. the new one or whatever. it was one of the worst i've seen in my days. i actually walked out of the theatre after about a half an hour so that was not cool at all. otherwise, we just milled around and went to caribou coffee countless times.

lets see......oh, this is enjoyable. a friend of mine just reccomeded a book to me called ""Cunt"". she said it is about like empowering women and whatnot. so i checked it out at barnes and noble and it looks pretty cool, somewhat resembling the vagina monologues in the fact that it has all of these crazy names for chapters, and different peoples' stories. so check it out people.

tomorrow i start working at the state fair which should prove to be eventful...i hope. i just hope i am not bored or something. also, i think i am gonna stay some time at parkers, and some time at ashley's, and then some time at my friend cali's dorm in the cities so i don't have to commute the whole time. i gotta get all that crap figured out too now.

i will write more things later, but for now i am not thinking of anything. holla."

"event","today i went to the mall of america to meet some friends. twas fun, but there were some minor mishaps. first, i was gonna open a card for old navy so i shopped around filling the bag with stuff i was gonna try on or whatever. then the guy who was processing my new card said their system was down and they couldn't. RAGE. so i spent all that time in there for nothing. then, the rest of the time there was fun with my friends........until i left and got on 494 and there was road work and i was almost raging. however, i have been working on my road rage problem and things have gotten better. yay for me. then, this psycho hose beast in front of me was letting EVERYONE in front of her even when the people who were going in front of her knew the lane was going to end like 3 miles back and they were just screwing everyone over. so that needed to stop.

in other news, my friend jake and i have decided to take a spring break trip to new york city which will kick major ass. i have to save up about $1000 dollars to go, so i must work 2 jobs i think. and we figured out that the time we are there is when the huge st.patricks day parade goes on. we will construct a float i think.

i am going home friday to stay the weekend while my family goes to missouri. i opted out on the family outing this time because they drive me INSANE. so i get to watch the cats i guess. my friend cali comes home tomorrow from florida. she survived the hurricanes thank goodness. 
well, that is all for now. i am sleepy but it is too late to take a nap. also, my roomates are gone so i am in this big house alone and it is a bit frightening. poor me. ha ha. later."

"event","hokay, i will begin writing again now that my computer is back up and running. today is the day that i finally moved into the house i am renting in river falls. my dad and brother helped me move in, which meant that they had to follow me all the way through the cities to get here. me, leading two vehicles, in the cities, ON SATURDAY. needless to say, i got quite the headache from that, but it was worth it. my room is pretty small and quaint, but it will do for me. my roomates all bought these new desks and shelves, etc, and painted their rooms and whatnot. then there's me that shows up with 70's retro chair from goodwill, and plastic drawers on wheels. holla. thats the way to go, let me tell you. once i get to know my roomates, i will tell you about them. all i can tell you is that libby likes pink. a lot. hokay.

also, we decided to get wireless internet which kicks ass. i don't know how it works, but it kicks ass and i know that much. i can download things much faster here without the firewalls or whatever they are called that they had in the dorms. 

lets see....i don't think anyone needs a recap of my summer, because you all know. pretty much, i went to scotland,  came back, read some cool books, and came here. holla. 

oh, i almost forgot something. although school isn't even that close to starting, river falls seems to be bustling. and let me tell you, we have some hot hot neighbor boys on every side! that calls for a HOLLA. i think things will unfold nicely.....ha ha ha........."

i still haven't figured out my financial aid crap for scotland. uh oh. 

so for the rest of this week, i will be unpacking my shit and starting to get ready for scotland. holla. then i will read a lot because when i am in school, i have no time to read things i want to read. so it is time for that. i have to download this journal thing onto my computer at home. however, that computer is from the stone age, so its gonna take FOREVER to download. i gotta download msn messenger too. that is gonna be a doosy as well. 

today it poured in the afternoon, and some guys from the building next to me put a slip and slide out in the lawn and slid around on it. how kick ass is that? a freakin' slip and slide. this is the same kid with the hardees ball pit in his room.

i also can't wait to see my friends from home again!!! yay!!! so this is all for now. it may be awhile until my next entry, so farewell."

I AM A MACHINE! seriously, i have been studying my ass of and finishing projects. but hey, its ok. lets see, this past weekend i went home to see my family which was much needed. me and my brother watched all 3 of the matrix movies. i kind of understand them now....only kinda. so that was fun. we also went to st.cloud to the mall where he bought a mr.t shirt and a milton shirt from hot topic. i bought some cool stickers from hot topic. he he. one says 'my other ride is your mom'. i love it. so it was fun times with my brother this weekend. 

in the midst of my homework here, i was reading in my social work book about elderly people, and there is a section on Gay and Lesbian Older Adults. how kick ass is that?! i mean, i don't want to think of old people having sex or anything...oh god.......but the concept is cool. i guess i never thought about, or have seen elderly lesbians. now i want a bumper sticker that says 'i brake for elderly lesbians'. wow, that would be SO COOL.

"event","i survived the rugby tournament. actually, as much as i didn't want to go at first, i had such a blast. ok, my roomate just gave me a glazed krispy kreme doughnut with chocolate frosting and sprinkles on it. orgasmic. back to this weekend....so we all got to stay in a hotel, as well as our guys' team which made it even more fun. we made quite the racket and probably pissed off old people, but hey, whatev. we went to the porn shop twice for some reason, and janice bought a new pipe, so we had to break that in of course. i hadn't smoked in so long, so it was grand. very relaxing.....wait, that was friday night. back to saturday: i got to play some drinking games with cody. cody is on the guys' rugby team and is the hottest guy ever ever ever. so that was good times. my plan was to get wasted, but then i got a super bad headache and went to bed. man,i'm a dork! saturday we beat mankato, and then lost to iowa state. dammit, they scored twice when it wasn't right. one, their kick to us didn't go far enough so our team didn't run to pick up the ball. apparently the sir thought it was fine when it clearly wasn't and iowa ran to the ball and ran and scored right off the bat. cheaters. the other time, iowa was close to their try zone and a whistle blew so uwrf just stopped their playing and iowa ran and 'scored'!! WTF?????? so that sir just sucked ars. for those who don't know, a sir is the same as a ref. but anyhoo, that sucked. iowa state was a kick ass team, so it just sucks that they scored trys illegally. oh well. on to sunday: first thing i see when i go out of my room to get some food: cody with his shirt off in the hallway. HOLLA. ha ha. ok sorry. today, we played gustavus and smoked em! i think their team was pretty new, so it was fairly easy, but a super fun game. i think we scored like 6 or 7 trys that game, they got none. but they were so nice because they are god people. they wished us luck in the tournament and all. cool people. i like nice people. we were supposed to advance at this point, but for some reason, they didn't leave time for the next brackets. WTF??? so then we got to go home.

so i think i decided that i will play again next weekend at lacrosse. i wanted to go home and visit the fam, but since there is no practice this tuesday, i think i will head home after class in the morning and stay for dinner and stuff. that will be good for me. must visit family. must.

next is an insert from an email i got from my friend nate. he is in the navy and is in florida now, so here is his funny experience. i laughed:
this weekend i was almost kidnapped, raped, necrofiliated(????) and dumped in the great florida swamps to be eaten by who knows what. you see  my friends and i were waiting for a cab to go to the movies when this cab pulls up on the side it says ""the lords taxi"" and the driver says there is no charge for military personel. well against my better judgement i(we) take the ride. and thats when it happens. we suddenly find ourselves in a cab with a religious fanatic! im not kidding this guy said that the devil came to his house in the form of a dog and that the easter bunny was the devil and that he saw a homosexual transvestite so he yelled at him/her and he/she started screaming, the screams of course were the demons inside of him/her. well that makes perfect sense doesnt it?! any way long story short we got to the movie just fine but i will never take another free ride from that wacko freak.

man, that totally cracks me up.

i am still trying to get this whole fafsa shit figured out. it sucks ass! i need to see how much i can get out of that so i can take out a loan for the remainder of what i need from the bank. i just need to get this figured out and off my back. with finals and all, there is just too much hanging over my head. i am just afraid for finals because i have worked my ass off all semester to pull A's on my exams, and i don't want a bad final exam grade to fuck up my entire semester of work. so i must must do good. but i am not gonna get too worried cause i have already started papers/projects, reading, etc. that need to get done for finals. i am going to get everything done in advance. holla.

cripes, i am really tired.......too much sun today. on my ending note, i got this shirt from the tournament that says this on the back: 
              TOP TEN REASONS TO PLAY RUGBY
10. ROAD TRIPPIN'
9.  WE LIKE IT ROUGH & DIRTY
8.  BOYS & GIRLS RUCKING TOGETHER
7.  DIVING IN
6.  IT'S TIGHT IN THE FRONT BUT WE LIKE IT IN THE BACK
5.  WE DO IT FOR 80 MINUTES WITHOUT PROTECTION
4.  WHORES ARE READILY AVAILABLE
3.  WE TRY BY DAY, SCORE BY NIGHT
2.  BEER, BEER AND MORE BEER!
1. ZULUS!
 there was another shirt that i didn't purchase that said RUGBY on the front, and AVAILABLE WHORE on the back. how kick ass is that!? okay, i am going now. holla."

"event","so my roomate left the  room yesterday evening for a few hours, so i watched the fabulous san antonio spurs. they are my favorite team perhaps amongs the new york knicks and now i like the timberwolves too. so the spurs won, and it was great.

i went to ALL of my classes today which feels good to do. i don't get that feeling very often. ha ha.

something a little more personal that i have been thinking about a lot but never talk about is about my tiny dad. see, tiny dad is has an alcohol problem along with smoking tobacco AND pot. ever since i was in like 9th grade i realized he had these problems and worry about him dying. it is sad, but to make it worse, last time i was home he said something that basically was like he expects himself to die within the next ten years. ok, this is not cool because now i think about it even more. i worry about him dying more than my grandparents. i think i just will never be ready for him to die you know? like i just feel like he won't have told me everything about his life by then. just that i won't be expecting it and things will be unresolved.i don't know. ok now i am crying to i will expand on that later.

i really want to go home this weekend. i think i get homesick because i worry about tiny dad, but i kinda have to go to this rugby tournament because i already said i would play. i am just keeping it in the back of my mind that these will be the last games of the season, and maybe forever for me. and my last practice. we have games in duluth on like may 8th but FUCK IT! dammit, i have company coming and its gonna kick major ass. so there!! so i am excited about that. yeah, the guys' team has games at this tournament as well this weekend. there is one severe hottie on their team that watches us play and yeah.......i feel like an ASS cause i don't know what the hell i'm doing. oh well, it shall be fun times getting kicked out of the hotel cause both of our teams are in the same hotel........BAD IDEA. ha ha.

man, i am listening to some quality led zeppelin right now, and damn they are good. damn.

on another note, i don't remember if i wrote earlier about the conversation i had with my friend alli, but it was to the extent of discussing gay marriages. she had put some ""definition"" of marriage in her AIM info about marriage only supposed to be between a man and a woman and a link to a website to basically vote against gay marriages. now, alli and i differ on this issue which i know, but this enraged me obviously and we got into a little 'quarrel' you may say. so we talked it over and made up cause thats what me and alli do. but she got into talking about the bible and that sort of thing which i considered. but after thinking about it for a couple days, i'm thinking its bullshit that the bible can declare being gay to be a sin. i just can't comprehend that at all! because you know what, i know a lot of straight people who are married that fuck up all the time. they beat their kids, they cheat on their spouses. they fuck up. i don't know what people are so afraid of by giving the basic FREEDOM to marry to ALL HUMAN BEINGS. dammit!!! so, i put other definitions of marriage in my info. because i can't just sit here and let people withhold human rights from a certain group of people. that is just not ok.

i've realized i cannot go through a day without raging. geez. but at least i get out my frustration. i got frustrated yesterday about something in my room and just yelled out the biggest FUUUUCCCKKKKK!!!!!!!!!! and it felt so good to do that. 

i gotta leave here at 3:50pm today because 16 people from our team are staying at another teamate, mac's house. i guess her parents are all excited and they are buying us food and whatnot. that kicks so much ass when people open up their homes like that. it is great. then we have games on saturday and on sunday. and get this. the U of M women's team is hoaring on with us, and they are a good good team. so we are gonna do good. and parker is on that team!!! holla. but if we do good, that means we will play  a lot more games than if we sucked, so i will be tired. but since we have their team and ours combined, there is more than enough people for subs so we won't all get so tired and beat up. i am kinda excited for the tournament, but i wanna go home :-( man, i'm a baby! i miss mommy and daddy j/k. 

i am still kinda raging about the fafsa, but thank goodness my dear brother helped me with the pin number. GO IAN!! ian used to punch me when i was little, but now we get along so fabulously. it is fun when i go home cause we watch tons of movies, go to the mall, and make fun of his wife together, quote office space lines, and make fun of michael jackson, ray charles, and stupid drivers. speaking of stupid drivers, ian has taught me all of my road rage skills including laying on my horn, flipping the bird, and riding peoples asses that pull out in front of you, and passing on the shoulder. good, quality time. 

well, i think i gotta finish packing now and eat some food. must eat food. so i am outtie for the weekend. i will write again either sunday or monday. goodbye people!"

anyhoo, lets see what is happening today. first off, outside my window and all around my building they are setting up for Hallapalooza. is that not the stupedist name EVER? i don't know what they were thinking. also, what pisses me off about this is that all of the food services on campus will be closed during this event to basically force people to come here to eat the picnic style food. this is ok, but the food here is only gonna be til 6:30, whereas normally i can get done with practice and still get food til 8. so now i am fucked in that department. FUCKERS.

so, my roomate still NEVER leaves the room. i guess i have just learned to live with it, but it drives me nuts sometimes. for example, i will be reading, clearly reading at my desk, and she turns the tv on. now, i am never mean enough to do it back. i just figure she will realize and out of consideration turn it off. no. so, since she watched so much tv this week, she now all of a sudden has tons of reading to do so she is sitting in her chair reading. i was on my bed. i turned the page in my notebook, and you know what she had the nerve to say? ""you're making a lot of noise."" WTF!!!! so i kinda raged on her by saying ""fuck that! fuck that! you always turn the tv on when i am reading!"" so yeah. at least she doesn't hold grudges. cause we were back to being nice like a minute later. but yes, i raged a little.

so, i hate george bush. dammit! how? how is he president? i just do not understand this at all........... i feel hopeless though because it is obvious he is gonna win out of some technicality. fucker!!!!!

i think i don't want to play rugby anymore........it was fun at first, but now i just feel like shit for a week after tournaments. i can't even cross my legs for the few days after a game cause my entire legs are bruised to hell and my kneecaps are busted. its so not worth it. also, i have to miss all of these meetings on campus that i would like to go to like amnesty, etc. because of rugby practice. then like 9 people show up to practice. bitches. 

okay, scotland is like a month away. i haven't sent in my fafsa yet. oh god. it will all work out. i just should have got this done awhile ago i guess.

i actually went running today. 2 whole miles. yay for jenna. nicholle came with me too. it was funny cause she looks like she's in shape, but she's not, so i ran and ran and ran and she stretched. it was fun though. and then after we got back and parked the hooptie, the hot skinny boy was playing basketball outside on the courts. damn. ""the kid's got some skills"" according to nicholle. and he's way hot so that helps.

i just realized that after my two tests this week, i have no more until finals! that kicks so much ass.

well, big rugby tournament this weekend. i don't know how this is going to feel, but i have learned that playing 3 games in a day is enough to wipe you out for a few days. but this weekend, i will play 3-4 games each day! i think i will need a Hover-round come monday. wouldn't that kick ass? cruisin' around campus in <a href=""http://www.uscoot.com/eshop/10Expand.asp?ProductCode=u-go"" target=""_blank""><u>this</u></a>.
man, i would feel so damn cool. i just think it would be cool to ride around in a wheelchair when you have no mobility problems whatsoever.

okay, i think i am gonna go to bed now. i really can't think of anything funny i saw today................
oh yeah! in economics, this girl had these low rise pants on, and her butcrack was showing to begin with, but for some reason, this girl KEPT DROPPING THINGS and bending forward to pick them up. i swear, i and the entire class could see this girls whole ass. she sits in the front too, and her ass crack was in my peripheral vision the entire freakin' time and i just couldn't stop laughing. wow, that was crazy. i'm never gonna think of that girl in the same way again.

another story that i don't think i have shared that was traumatic for me...........we have a rule here that if you leave your clothes in either the washer or dryer for more than 5 minutes after the cycle has stopped, anybody waiting for a machine has the right to take your clothes out. so, i did that a few weeks ago, and as i was pulling out the laundry, i noticed this chick had the NASTIEST underwear and bras EVER. seriously, her bras were all of this nasty padded shit, and her underwear had wholes and stuff in them with *gasp* BROWN STAINS which were of undisclosed origin. seriously, it was so bad. yeah, i had to remove two whole loads of this crap that i felt nasty touching. i decided that i was gonna go as quick as i could because i really didn't want to find out whose laundry this was. but..........the girl comes down there as i was leaving so now every time i see this chick i am so grossed out. seriously, if you have period accidents or what have you.........BUY SOME NEW UNDERWEAR!!!! also, please don't wear nasty bras with huge padding and cardboard in them cause boys don't like to touch it anyways! she is so nasty! dammit! okay, i am going to bed now."

first off, there is a starbucks on every block, there are lots of trees, greenery and flowers, yes it is cloudy but it only rains a little bit each day, and there are lots of metrosexuals walking around, and EVERYONE drinks coffee 24 hours a day. with that said, here is what i did:
DAY1:
we arrived in seattle around 2pm, and we got to take limos to our hotel which was fun. then we met later to go check out the space needle, and the <a href=""http://www.emplive.com/visit/about_emp/building.asp"" target=""_blank""><u>experience music project</u></a>. click on the little picture to check out the building cause that was the coolest part. also, inside of this building there are many cool images and moving stuff to look at when you are stoned. it kicked ass. after we touristed around, we actually ate at the top of the space needle which kicked ass because it revolved around while you ate. it didn't make you dizzy though.......that would be interesting if it did. so, with 9 of us, our bill was a little over $500.00. we got to do that though cause the social work funds paid for it. it ruled. then we went back to the hotel where everyone was boring and dumb, but my roomate at the hotel katie, and i decided to walk around. we took a picture in front of the 7-eleven with our ""big gulps"". the guy who took the pic. told us where a cool music store, so there we were walking around downtown seattle in the dark. but we found the music store and it kicked ars.

DAY 2: 
ok, this day was the day we went to the UW to check out the grad program. we had a little overview and then got to sit in on a class of our choice. then we went down the the internationl district and had some food. i ate some cambodian fried rice and it was so good! in the restaraunt there were these HUGE goldfish swimming around in this tank which was weird.......  after this, we got talked to some more about kind of boring stuff. then we took the bus back to the hotel. oh yeah, then we also went to a play in the empty space theatre which was way cool, and we ate at coldstone. LOL. i didn't have any though. so we called some cabs and one came and then my group stood outside for an hour waiting. that sucked.

DAY 3:
today was our day to go off in groups and do whatever we wanted to. so me and 3 other girls took a bus to the market. this is where the pike's place fish throwing people are. this place was so cool! there were fresh flowers everywhere to buy. so many tulips. it was grand. i saw something really funny in there but i will talk about that later if i remember. after the market, we took another bus to kurt cobain's old house where he killed himself which sounds morbid, but it was cool because we also found kurt's park where there are these benches with stuff written by his fans. it was so so cool. then we went home, and me and katie took another bus to the university district to shop. after we got back, my friend dan who lives near seattle came and picked me up and took me back to his school. his school is really dumb. then he tried to take me to this thing, and he got lost. dammit dan. oh well, it was fun to see him.

DAY 4:
this was our day of flying FOREVER. we pretty much got up, and flew all day until i got home at midnight and went to bed. on my very last flight from phoenix to minneapolis, i sat next to this guy who was going home for the first time in 7 months cause he had been in iraq. that sucks ass for him. oh well.

oh, they have this in seattle too. ethan, <a href=""http://www.slgc.org/"" target=""_blank""><u>this is for you</u></a>"

"event","so yes, i have popped in some Led Zeppelin for this beautiful day. good stuff. i have these things stored up in my head that i must share with others because they are really funny. i only have like 10 minutes here before lunch so here we go.........

some funny bumper stickers i've seen lately:
PROUD PARENT OF AN ACCELERATED READER (on a handicapped/church van. wtf?)
I PEE IN POOLS (this one is extra funny because it was on an old guy's old F150. LOL)
I LOVE ANIMALS. THEY ARE DELICIOUS.

i think that was all of the bumber stickers......now, the accelerated reader one. 1)who produces and distributes these in the first place? 2)where would you even find one to buy? 3)who cares if your kid can read extra fast? don't show off!!!

tomorrow i leave for seattle. woo hoo. i'll be back saturday night, so i will journal on sunday i reckon.

wanna hear something funny? see, my dad earns PTO (paid time off) every so often. we always made fun of him because every time he earned it, he would use it all up in like the first three days. the funny part is that poor tiny dad got put on probation at work for doing this!! it isn't fair really, because he should be allowed to leave whenever he wants if he has the PTO. but yeah, tiny dad is on probation for ""abusing PTO"". how funny is that?

scotland is nearing...........it shall kick ass.

ok, time for some more blimpies as usual."

"event","well, i had a fabulous weekend. i hung out with my brother a lot. also, we had Easter lunch with grandma and grandpa on saturday. i hadn't seen them in awhile so that was grand. then on sunday we had our family Easter dinner. good, good food. 

some good news: i tried one of those lactaid pills and ate a DQ blizzard and...........IT WORKED. it was great. now i can eat icecream, including cold stone. holla.

also, i have received my glasses. they are neat to say the least. 

i leave for seattle on wednesday morning. i have to be at the airport at 6 am! that doesn't sound so bad until you realize that i must leave at like 4:30 because of rush hour, which also means i will actually have to wake up around 3:30-4am. yes, a.m. dammit. i don't like flying AT ALL. jenna rages when greasy icky people touch me and brush against me. everyone must stay in their own personal space bubbles!!! rage for the day.

so, this morning in my first two classes, i took a test in each class. that sucked ars cause i don't think i did so hot. oops. 

this is all for now. time to go eat some tasty blimpies for lunch now. yeah, and then go to class again. twice. rage."

"event","so right now i am avoiding studying.....what a long ass day. so first i got up and went to class and i got to make as much noise as i wanted because nicholle is gone. it was fabulous. in class i got my test back that i took on tuesday and i got above an A. i don't know how that is possible, but i was above the cap for the A range. i was simply delighted. then i did my laundry and sat at my computer while campus tour people invaded my space and were peering into my room. seriously, i don't like when people do that. ever. 

so then i had to go home too to get my eyes checked. indeed, jenna is getting glasses folks. wait til you see them. they are like brownish green plastic things. hideous but cool. ha ha. then i ate at kfc with my brother. i am eating too much food dammit. maybe i will go on the ethan georgia diet. for real.

so then i drove all the way back here, and i will go home again tomorrow for the weekend. rage. i HATE stupid drivers. dammit i hate em. 

ok, i must go study now. so so tired."

i am so bummed because next weekend there is a big tournament and we are getting hotel rooms and everything but i will be in seatlle. seattle will kick way more ass though. it just sucks that i gotta miss that : (

so the roomate has left for the weekend! it is absolutley fabulous! i am so so excited to go home friday i can not wait!! why i still get homesick, the world may never know...........

oh my goodness! i saw the BEST shirt ever today. here's how it went down. it was light blue shirt with a cartoon beaver on it with a comic caption thing coming out of it's head. and you know what it was saying? ""DAM"". i love it!!! i think i like it so much because of this beaver thing that happened in my hometown. i'll talk aboot that some other time.

well, it is time for traffic people. jenna will be flipping the bird on many occasions i think tonight. and if i see blockhead, i am going to just steer myself into the cement blockades and end it all. i'll do it. okay....i won't. but if i see blockhead i'm gonna rage."

well, my beloved cat Booker T. was found. however, not alive. i guess dora and ian were playing golf in my back yard and dora's ball went into these shrub things next to my garage. and when she went to find it, she found booker........poor dora. mom said it looked like he laid down to sleep or something by the way he was laying, but did not wake up. i guess there is a 'hole' in his body, but no blood. so maybe something was eating him there... so he was buried. poor booker. it is sad : (

nicholle is leaving on wednesday for the weekend! i am so so glad because i love having the room to myself once in awhile. then, next week, i leave wednesday morning and don't come back til late saturday. then, there is only 4 weeks of school left. it is going to fly by! it is going to be almost 70 degrees today and a nice breeze is developing.........yay for me.

so, i did sign the lease last night to live in a house with 5 other girls. i guess we are breaking the city code.....oops. you can only have 5 unrelated persons living in a house at one time, so we gotta not get caught. it is the coolest house ever too. it is right off of main street. and BRIGHT PURPLISH-BLUE next to all whitish houses. i love it. i get my own room too. and........one of my roomate's dad actually owns the house, so we can paint and stuff in there. good stuff.

took another test this morning.........think i kicked ass. 

really, i am just excited for arbys, so yeah. goodbye."

"event","yes, i hope people had a good weekend. i did i think....... we had the rugby tournament yesterday in winona which was fun. we took 2nd place out of 4 teams if i'm correct. we lost to winona twice and beat st.bens. holla. i shall take photographs of my injuries this time. good stuff. also, i have the room to myself this weekend which is a plus. it is so great not having the tv on ALL THE TIME. seriously, i have to go to the study lounge any time i need to read because all my roomate does is watch tv. it is so bad. oh well, she is still cool and i am choosing to live with her again next year, so oh well.

i think tonight i may go to applebees for dinner. i haven't gone there since i began eating meat again, so this could be fun for me.........yay!

yeah, and my roomate and i got picked this week as 'wing reps.' or whatever. so basically, we have to attend hall council tonight which will not be cool at all because i just don't want to talk to stupid people about casino night and kareoke night ok? dammit.

okay, as i was just discussing with nick on msn, i realized i only have like 5 weeks of school left! 6 technically, but i will be in seattle for one of those weeks, so it doesn't count right? and with rugby practices and homework and rugby games, the weeks go so fast. this is gonna rule.

oh yes, i had another tooth dilemma. don't ask me why, but after i got my wisdom teeth pulled out, they were fine for three whole weeks until........friday. i woke up and one of them was all swollen and crap, so after my last class i had to drive home(through rush hour might i add) to make it to the dentist again all for him to look at my tooth for 5 seconds and give me antibiotics. fuckers. anyways, so since i was so close to home, i ventured to my house cause it was my dad's birthday friday......go dad! we  had tacos and it was fun times. he got a new vacuum and i've never seen him so excited, besides the time he thought for like 5 seconds that he had one the lottery. that was a funny one......... so after dinner,i drove all the way back around the cities to river falls and woke up the next day at 5am to go to the rugby tournament. 

yes, this is getting a bit lengthy, but another funny story, also adding to my seinfeld moments. as i was driving on 694 in the right lane, there was this minivan to my left that was going the same speed, pissing off the people who wanted to go faster cause the bitch would not get out of the fast lane. so, this little silver Lancer goes behinnd me and is riding my ass, which is about to cause the middle finger effect. i decided not to, and later on when the person went around the minivan, he honks at me and i could see him waving but he had super tinted windows so i couldn't tell who it was. the liscense plate was from maine or something, so i was like WTF? i couldn't think of anyone it could be so i forgot about it. so.........i caught up to the lancer later on, and he opened his driver's side window and it was none other than Block-head!!! Block-head is this boy from high school with a reallly big, boxy head, like a little Lego guy. i couldn't believe it. so i waved or whatever. then he proceeded to make every single move i made, switching lanes and taking exits, etc. dammit block head!! go away!!! finally, he thought he would be cool and speed away which he did, and that was the last of him. crazy shit. yeah, he is in the navy, hence the liscense plate. this may not sound very funny to you, but block head was a legend in highschool. he is also known as Fat-head. i'll have to show you a picture or something............."

"event","so, happy april fools day to everyone. i must think up some antics for today........i was thinking about switching everyone's door decorations around: like put up the boy's decorations on our doors and vice versa. everyone would get all turned around. good times. however, i think this would be too difficult to execute.

so,i think i will go to Blimpie's for lunch today. what a crazy name for a sub shop: Blimpies. what the hell. oh well, it is pretty tasty most days. 

tomorrow is the big psychology test i have been studying for all week, and reading for. i think i can do well on this. must get good grades.

something crazy to report: i am for the first time attracted to a skinny boy. what the hell has happened? i normally like boys to be a bit beefy, but not too much. this boy however, is like zero muscle i think. maybe it is just the fact that he is tall and has dark hair. but he is hot none the less.

so hungry. must go to blimpies.

so, nobody ever shows up for rugby practice and it is starting to piss me off. like 8 people will show up out of the 25 on our team. what is up with that? so if this keeps happening, i am gonna be in lacrosse or something. cause i've seen them practice, and their team actually shows up for practice. there was supposed to be this rugby tournament in winona this weekend, but i guess there are only games on saturday, not sunday. so i decided i am just going to go home on friday and not come back to school until sunday. my dad's birfday is on friday as well. we are gonna have tacos. holla. also, my parents need all this stuff for taxes, so i have to go home and gather some paperwork. yay.

i had to fill out a fafsa yesterday in order to get a student loan for when i go to scotland this summer. the fafsa sucks ass. jenna's gonna rage.

so, now that they found that girl in madison, i heard that another girl is missing from lacrosse........anyone know anything about that? that pisses me off!!!

and for the record, yesterday was the day that someone had targeted as being the day that all colored students at uwrf would ""die columbine style"" as they wrote, but nothing happened. thank god for that. hopefully today goes ok too.......there is tons of cops on campus too, from stout, gustavus, etc. crazy stuff. some people really suck and i  should hurt them."

lunch is in 10 minutes. and dammit, i am bringing my own soy milk this time because i asked them for some one time, so they went in the back to get some, and it was like brown or something and it tasted so bad!! i just want some freakin cereal with some tasty soy milk. i hate the food service here. rage upon everyone.

ethan, its a go on the pink taco shirt. you just can't pass something like that up. you must buy it.

so i added up all my hours of volunteering at the elementary, and i only have to go 2 more times. although i like being there, it is right in middle of my day, and i hate having to walk to the parking lot every time i have to go. so i am happy aboot this.

today will be another day of reading endless pages of text that mean nothing to me. holla."

my body is still SO  sore from the rugby game on saturday. it is sort of ok during the day, but when i wake up in the morning and my muscles are all stiff, i can't straighten out my legs. it is bad. so to add to that, i decided to go running today, and i ran two and half miles. so that should feel just peachy tomorrow........not.

i bought this lotion that smells like vanilla frosting or cake or something of that nature. good stuff.

some depressing news, my beloved cat Booker T. named after the wrestler has disappeared. he has been gone since sunday morning. i know its only been 2 days, but he normally comes to the door every 5 minutes to eat. i am sad about that........

i think it's gonna be crappy outside again tomorrow, which i don't like. i get salty and don't want to go to classes when that happens. at least i don't have practice until wednesday, because i don't want to practice in the snow whatsoever. so practice is wednesday and thursday this week, then friday i will go to the rugby house and get a little tipsy you may say. then saturday and sunday is fools fest in winona, MN. holla. i guess for this tournament, we play up to 4 games a day, and by the 2nd and 3rd one, everyone is already wasted. that should be interesting............he he he.

so my RA is insane!! she runs every day, so i asked her how much she ran the other day. she said 9 miles!! she's a machine man. she is a fire crotch too. i guess she is training for the grandma's marathon. that is just nuts man.

i am going to go read now. but my own book dammit. for my own pleasure. i am re-reading to kill a mocking bird at the moment. good, good stuff. bed time. goodnight everyone."

on lighter notes:
i have skipped 0 classes this week. that is right, ZERO. i deserve something for that man. a gold star at least. somebody send me a gold star or i'll be pissed. i must visit my advisor today to get my registration code and to know what classes to take. i am just aboot done with my generals thank goodness. yeah, but i have put off my speech class, so thats next..........i don't enjoy speeches at all.

there is this boy in 2 of my classes that is a replica of silent bob, from of course, jay and silent bob. it makes me happy. also, in one of these classes, there is this boy who always is writing in this little tiny notebook thing. i seriously wonder what he writes in there all the time....probably personal stuff, but it is interesting..........

seriously, my roomate need to learn how to disable her AIM sounds when she is away. IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

yeah, i was talking to my friend jake who goes to marquette, which i think is in milwalke(yes, i don't know how to spell that). anyhoo, he said 18 people there are being sued for downloading music. that is so scary!!! i may be busted for using kazaa, because all of a sudden, a box popped up that said, ""kazaa will close now. you will need to pay $39.95 a month for service"". then.........all of a sudden a couple of days later, my shared music folder has disappeared from my desktop. cripes, this is a little frightening. i will go into hiding i think. on the other hand, i must not be too scared because when kazaa shut down on me, i just downloaded the winmx service!! ha ha fools.

another thing i have been pondering............i think me and my roomate should shut the blinds from now on when we change clothes because random people smile at me on the sidewalk..........oops.

ok, time to go to advisor now. holla."

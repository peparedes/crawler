"event","Things have been looking up.  Some slight progress has been made...a clean weekend was had and discussion of treatment was opened.  I'm hopeful, but also keeping one foot out the door.  Taking it day by day, but I have to say, it's been really great for the past few days.  

We had been planning for a long time to get a dog.  I somehow changed his mind, back in the day, about the type of dog to get.  He and his daughter wanted a black lab.  I'm not so keen on the lab so I brought up the doberman pinscher.  Well, he fell in love with the idea and we started looking into breeders.  We had found one back in November that had just had a litter but decided that it was just too soon, that we weren't quite ready.  They told us we could wait for the next litter so we did.  Well, April 1, our baby Betty the red female doberman was born.  We're excited as hell.  I think this has to do with the change in behavior for my man.  6-7 more weeks, and we'll have her home with us.  (if I'm still here)

He took me for for my first off-road bike ride today.  I'm pretty proud of myself.  I only hit 1 tree, and I slowed down and actually caught it so it's not like I even smacked it.  I only had one other accident where I didn't quite make this jump thingy.  I bailed and actually landed on my feet.  It was quite impressive.  And luckily he had stopped after he had gone over it to see if I would make it, I would have been disappointed if no one saw my cat-like reflexes."

Those bad things are slowly being phased out, I'm happy to report.  Craig is building me a mountain bike and we're both planning on getting healthy, healthy, healthy.

This past weekend he and I took a much needed little road trip down to the hill country.  While there we did some hiking at Pedernales Falls and Enchanted Rock.  The weather was perfect...had a fabulous time.  Too bad we have to come home to reality.

Well, ok, life has been good aside from last weekend.  Yeah, that was bad.  The main thing was getting ran off the road by some bitch in her big white truck and running over big city titties for a while so I don't go into the bike lane on Mockingbird and bursting 2 tires.  Stupid bitch not paying attention.  I had to replace 2 tires and will be replacing a rim.  My poor baby girl (my car) has been through so much shit.  

Anyway, I took the day off to go to the dentist and had to go up to school to take a skills test...now I'm home waiting for Craig to get home so we can take Ocean to the fair tonight.  Oh the joys of almost step-motherhood.  Ok, not really.  I'm being a little melodramatic.  She's a great kid, we are just still getting used to each other being around.  It'll be fun."

"event","Ok, so finally*a post about last weekend.

So Jeff and I headed down south to New Braunfels on Saturday morning 
for the Old 97's show/live CD recording that night at Gruene Hall.  
(pronounced ""green"", though in true German it shouldn't be).

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v405/jeannieboo/GrueneHall.bmp"" width=288 height=216>

We get to town early afternoon and find Gruene after we have to wait a 
little while for our room to be ready.  I had no idea how happening 
this little town would be.  There were people swarming everywhere.  We 
find a parking place and decide to walk around a little bit.  We go into 
Gruene Hall which opens up during the day for beer drinkers.  This place 
has no air conditioning.  We sit there for a little while as Jeff 
finishes his beer.  I am feeling tired so we go back so I can have a 
nap*especially since we'd be in the hear all night at the show.  So I sleep a 
little long and get up and rush to get ready for dinner at the 
Gristmill before the show.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v405/jeannieboo/Gristmill.bmp"" width=230 height=173>

There were literally over 100 people waiting for tables*even one party 
of 55 people.  You wait in this outdoor area and watch the board for 
your name.  It was HOT!  I was hungry*and getting very cranky.  We were 
standing there waiting for about 10 minutes when we hear the Old 97's 
start to play.  I get excited*and leave the waiting area to go look 
through the chicken wire surrounding Gruene Hall as they do their sound 
check.  I was happy then.  So anyway*after a good 30-35 minute wait we 
finally get called.  The girl taking us to our table said, ""We're going ALL 
the way up.""  Well, ok.  So we get up to this tiny little room up 3 
crickety flights of stairs.  Up there was 2 small tables and one long 
table.  The long table had a few people sitting at it and menus in the 
empty spots*didn't think too much about it.  About 10 minutes later Rhett, 
Murray and Phillip come walking up there and sit down at the long 
table.  My jaw drops and I just kept hitting Jeff's arm letting him know 
that was the band.  At one point Rhett went out onto this little balcony 
attached to our tiny dining room at which time I tuned into the cool cat 
I am.  I walked out there and said something like, ""Um, I'm a big 
fan*.would you please do me the honor and take a picture with me?""  Oh god, 
how corny could I be*.but he glady agrees and I motion for Jeff to 
bring his camera phone out and take a pic.  Stupid, stupid, stupid me for 
not bringing my behemoth camera*it takes much better pics than this damn 
camera phone.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v405/jeannieboo/Gristmill.bmp"" width=235 height=180>

We chit-chat for a split second then our food came so I left them 
alone.  I didn't want to be the stalker fan.  So blah blah blah*.we make it 
over to the hall and after Bobby Bare, Jr. gets off stage, I make my 
way down to the front.  Met some nice folks waiting for the show to 
start.  The show was absolutely amazing.  Had to be the best Old 97's show 
I've ever seen.  They played 30 songs*over 2 full hours.  And I sweat my 
fucking ass off.  During the show, Rhett even looked over at us and 
gave us a smile and head nod of recognition.  After the show Jeff went and 
talked to them (the men's bathroom area was also the backstage area).  
Jeff told him that this was his first show and how he enjoyed it so 
much*also said that Rhett said something about us standing out*didn't 
expect us to or some crap*.well duh, we just had dinner with you 30 minutes 
ago*)  Anyway*it was a great night. I had such a blast.

Late Sunday morning we got up and decided to head down to the river to 
do a float trip.  It was good and hot and I got a little sunburn on 
parts that I didn't sunscreen.  It was quite fun.  I think we'll have to 
get a group together and do it again sometime this summer.

I have to go spend money on my damn computer.  It appears as though I have an old piece of crap video card and must upgrade so that my online school stuff goes off without a hitch.  I guess I'll try to bill this onto my school expenses that my parents are helping me out with.  Must get an ink cartridge too and hope that my printer still works after sitting there for way too long.  Hopefully my bro will be a nice bro today and install the video card and my new dvdr drive so that I can get some school work done.  I'm thinking I won't go out to see Hank this weekend so that I can get crap done...namely school work so that I can next weekend instead...and hopefully get some work done on my ink seeing as that I heal so very slow.  

Off to Fry's for me...."

I'm not awake enough to endure this.  I didn't go to bed until around 5 this morning.  I did skip work and sleep til 11 but I haven't gotten enough sleep still.  I'm sure that since this class is only once a week we'll be there the whole entire time and probably cover 3 chapters or something sick like that.  I have got to start getting motivated about school soon and start taking some of my online tests for my online class and get them out of the way before I get overwhelmed.  I think that will be a goal for the weekend.

Well, the changes in my life are already starting.  I have purged one person from my life permanently.  Oh it was coming.  No one ever needs someone in their life who calls themself a friend but loves to berate and belittle you when they get a little angry that you might have done somehting they thought was a little rude.  Anyway, life will be better without him.  Moving on...

I donated $15 to a tsunami fund today.  I feel good about that.  I need to make some good new years resolutions.  Not the silly ones like I will quit smoking because I know I won't even though I know I should.  I need to continue with these changes and incorporate them....stuff to get my life in order.  

I have to work tomorrow while most of the rest of the country is off.  We have Monday off instead.  Kinda dumb I think but at least when everyone is at work on Monday, I'll be cozy, comfy in my NASA space bed.  Not sure about what we're gonna do tomorrow night.  I guess we're playing it by ear...nothing too fun I'm sure.  Maybe he'll work on my tattoo again.  I think it's finally getting healed enough to do a little more.

"event","I need to make some serious changes in my life in the near future.  I don't want to get into much detail because some are things that a few of you have been telling me for a while but I have ignored it all.  

I'm tired of all of these ups and downs of looking in on my life and what I'm not getting.  No wait, that's not the way I want to put it--it's more of the things that I'm settling for when I shoudn't compromise.  It's time to get real.  Face the music that is my life....much be it elevator music.  Either it annoys the hell out of you, puts you to sleep, or you find yourself humming and tapping your foot to it then stop because someone might see you and you'd be embarassed.  Yes, this seems to be the story of my life.

I'm tired of trying to make things work that are just broken.  Duct tape only lasts so long, and at some point that comfy, worn item loses it's shape needs to be put out to pasture...much like Billy's old Cons.  Early spring cleaning in a sense, I guess...that is if I ever get around to or get the balls to go through with it. 

I have realized that I'm a gluton for punishment and I always end up wanting what I can't have.  In a way, it's a good thing because in hind-sight those are always the things I don't need...nor would really fulfill me.  But nonetheless, I keep on keepin' on.  Mistake after mistake...broken hearts, hurt feelings, self-esteem tattered.  This is what I do best.  It's time to stop the insanity and reach for the stars.

And knowing is half the battle.

Change only happens when we make it happen....

The chase is getting old...

Change what you can and deal with the rest.

"event","Had dinner with my parents and their old friends from high school then it was poker night.  I have to say, I did pretty kick ass.  I think I need to go to vegas and play some texas hold'em.  It's surprising to see how much I remember from Phil's commentary on Celebrity Poker.  I had to leave before the night was finished because I can't stop sneezing.  I hate so much to be allergic to my dear little cute, mean-ass kitty.  

And Cliff, that's the one thing you left out of my x-mas present...no more allergies...

Tomorrow I am off from work, thank god.  Gotta finish wrapping gifts and go see some friends.  Must do some much needed cleaning around the house as well but I'm looking forward to sleeping in and not having to get up and out of bed in these frigid temperatures.  

Gonna let the benedryl kick in and crawl in bed where it'll be nice and warm.

Merry s-mas to all."

Do you ever feel sorry for that couple?  You know, the one you see sitting in a restaurant together looking bored to tears.  Those that have nothing to say to each other.  They just sit there and eat.  In and out in 30 minutes.  Yeah.  bleh."

"event","Finished up school for the semester on Tuesday.  Found out today that I pulled off an A in the class.  I'm half surprised.  I know I'm fairly intelligent but I put next to no time into studying this semester.  I just haven't felt motivated for the past 5 months.  Hopefully that will change come January when I'm working pretty much full time hours and taking 3 classes.  Life will not be fun.

Since then I've been trying to keep myself busy and having some much needed fun.  I've got Monday off and Hank supposedly has been working on my drawing this week so maybe I'll end the long weekend with some new ink on me.  That would be nice.

I think I'm off to bed pretty soon.  I have a list of crap I need to get done around the house tomorrow."

So I guess I'll just get this off my chest and leave it at that.

Monday night before cooking something to eat, I clean up the kitchen.  I look out into the living room and notice my brother sitting on the couch with a coffee table full of plates and fast food bags and dr pepper cans piled up.  So if he can't take the trash to the trash can, I'll bring the trash can to the trash.  I walk the trash can over there and sit it next to the coffee table.  He makes a sigh and then starts to fill it with random items but never gets all of it off the table.  It is now Thursday night at 11:03 pm and where is the trash can?  Still sitting next to the half cleaned off coffee table.  The damn slob couldn't even put the trash can back in it's place.  I'm so sick and tired of living with the biggest slob on the planet!!!  Calgon take me away."

Of course on the day I want to sleep in, my mom calls at 8:45.  How does she know when I'm staying home???  This isn't the first time that has happened.  I did go back to sleep afterwards for a little while though.

I took my car in to the shop today so I won't have my baby for a while.  Today I get to ride in some GMC Canyon...a truck.  I am so not a truck girl but that's all the rental car place had.  I'm hoping to trade it out later today for a smaller piece of crap car that won't cost me anything.  Back in the day, they OFFERED free upgrades to what insurance will pay if they didn't have any in stock.  But nooo, not this time and I didn't feel like arguing this morning.  So they had better have one that my insurance will cover all of the cost on this afternoon...if not, I'm raising hell.  

I just went and met Adam for lunch and now it's time to get to studying."

"event","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Christian conservative leaders say their top priority in President Bush (news - web sites)'s second term is the appointment of conservative judges to the Supreme Court and throughout the judicial system. 
   

""We have high hopes of changing the judiciary. Every judicial appointment that President Bush makes will make the courts less radical and more in tune with the voters who turned out in Tuesday's election,"" said Gary Bauer (news - web sites), a prominent Christian conservative leader and president of American Values, a conservative pressure group. 

In other news, I just had a damn wreck.  Not my fault.  But the guy has no insurance.  Suckass.  Good thing my brother works for a body shop and family members get 25% off up to $500 of the deductible.  This guy makes no money but has offered to pay my deductible...we'll see if that actually happens."

If anyone needs a tattoo, go see him, he needs some money, and he's good.  I need to come home tonight and do some school crap but I feel like I should go see him and cheer him up.

We got to the show early so I could grab something to eat before it and as we were walking through the parking lot Ken was walking out to their tour van.  I wish we had gone up to him and talked to him...maybe met the others.  Oh well.  I'm still stoked about the show.  It was the best show I have seen in ages.  

Cliff, I was looking for you the whole time but I didn't ever see you.  Actually, I didn't even see anyone I knew there.  I find that kinda strange, though the Granada isn't set up for walking around hunting for people.  Hope you had a good time!!!"

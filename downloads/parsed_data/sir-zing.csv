The new year. 2012. I&#39;m determined to make it count.<br />This year I&#39;ll be brave. This year I&#39;ll kiss her.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been in love with Alexis since I met her two years ago.<br /><br />I was walking in to my first class at a new school, having just moved to town.<br /><br />She was sitting in the front row.<br /><br />I had no idea who she was, but I couldn&#39;t help but stare.<br />She was absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />Long dark hair framing a small, gentle face,<br />She stole my breath away the moment I saw her.<br />Of course, staring at pretty new faces isn&#39;t always the best idea.<br /><br />I wasn&#39;t watching where I was going and tripped on a chair, falling on my side. I felt like a complete fool, with comments like<br />&quot;have a nice trip, see you next fall!&quot; and &quot;walk much??&quot; coming from every direction.<br />That was, until I saw Alexis&#39; face. I&#39;d landed right next to her.<br />The only thing hurting was my pride, so I got up, and our eyes met.<br />She smiled, and helped me pick up the books I&#39;d dropped.<br />Not having any idea what to say, I blushed, took the books, and scrambled to the empty seat at the very back.<br /><br />That was two years ago.<br />Since then, she&#39;s been the only girl I can think about.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think the rest of the class ever forgave her for helping me.<br />Guys try to hit on her, sure, but she just glares or rolls her eyes at them, so they call her frigid; a prude.<br /><br /><br />Any time I see her though, she always smiles at me and says hello, and the only one freezing then is me.<br />I just stand there, speechless, until she shakes her head, smiling and moves on.<br /><br />What do you say to a girl like that?<br />&quot;Hey, we don&#39;t really talk much, but I think you&#39;re beautiful. Will you kiss me?&quot;<br /><br />I have no idea how to talk with girls, let alone a teenage goddess.<br />This year though, all that&#39;s going to change.<br /><br />It&#39;s the first day of the new school year, and I can&#39;t go another year like this.<br /><br />Standing at the doors outside of school, I&#39;ve got this all planned out.<br />Before I lose my nerve, I&#39;ll march up to her and stop in her path.<br />She&#39;ll look surprised but smile that perfect smile and say &quot;Hello.&quot; That&#39;s when I do it.<br />I&#39;ll lean in, gently take her face into my hands, and kiss her perfect, soft lips.<br /><br />There she is. I move into her path, and our eyes lock. &quot;She&#39;s even more beautiful than I remember..&quot; comes to mind.<br /><br />She smiles, and that&#39;s when it happens.<br />I trip.<br />The uneven sidewalk caught the front of my shoe and I fall, face first, my lips planting firmly on her shoes.<br />Stunned, I linger a moment too long, and realize I&#39;m kissing her feet!<br />&quot;Good boy,&quot; she says, smiling and walking past.<br /><br />I&#39;m think I&#39;m in love."

Went through it all easily, decided after I'd passed it to get some thai food from Lemongrass Thai, which, as most of you have never had it, is AMAZING, so I, feeling gutsy, make the first U-turn of my life. I wasn't going to make it idling the whole way, and realized it about, ehh, I'll say almost halfway?&nbsp;So I gave it a little gas, which, to my luck and surprise, did exactly what I needed it to, and got me through the rest of the Uey (which I&nbsp;was completing in the far right lane), but because of the extra little umph I&nbsp;got, put me all the way back into the left lane as I was coming out of it, making me do something that looked a bit like an S. It was all safe and fine, because I had waited until the light had changed to do it, so there wasn't any other traffic waiting to hit me. Liz started laughing. It was pretty relieving. lol <br /><br />Hope you all enjoyed this adventure. I'm sure there will be more. <br /><br />Leah suggested Drive-Thrus next!&nbsp;<br /><br />Who knows what mysteries the future holds! Tune in next time!</font></b><br /><br />"

"event","So the past two days have been exactly that:&nbsp;Amazing. Last night, Liz and I&nbsp;joined Patricia, Adrian, and Rob Barrow (Big guy who comes into photo all the time who gave us tickets), to see Judas Priest, aka, British Steel. 

It was ridiculously amazing. There was choroegraphed headbanging, guitar raising, rocker stance, you name it. 

Go watch School of Rock and understand that it REALLY is how they do it. 

It really was incredible. The guitar solos...oh the guitar solos...

It was really loud, but we had a suite to sit in&nbsp;(SWEET!), so we kicked back in the chairs and closed the glass sliding door, which gave just enough of a buffer that we kept our hearing, but still watched them rock hardcore. 

Later, they proceeded to drive a motorcycle on stage, and proceeded to rock from there, where it remained for the rest of the (albeit encoreless)&nbsp;concert. 

I&nbsp;loved it. 

THAT&nbsp;was yesterday. 

TODAY, at around 11 AM&nbsp;this morning, I took Tom's car, yes, you read that correctly, me, driving,&nbsp; to the Hillsborough County Tax Collector's office, and proceeded to wait in line for...oh, about an hour for them to call B133. Liz and I&nbsp;sat against the wall, on the floor, and played monopoly on my phone. 

When my number was finally called, I&nbsp;strolled up the middle aisle between where everyone else, (the place was packed), was sitting, and walked straight to the counter ahead, where my number had been called. 

I handed over the title and the insurance card, she looked it over, punched it in, asked me to go with the county sheriff to show him the VIN and the odometer. I&nbsp;proceeded over, he asked me to pull the car to the curb where he glanced and asked for the odometer reading, I&nbsp;read it off to him, then proceeded to park in the &quot;reserved VIN&nbsp;checking&quot;&nbsp;spot. I&nbsp;did, strolled back in, went to the teller, signed the paperwork, and, after a little computer trouble, in which I&nbsp;was like &quot;it's okay, whatever's easiest for you&quot; the teller told me&nbsp;&quot;no no, I'm here to help you. It's what YOU&nbsp;want. I work here.&quot; 

SO, after all that, I now have a custom license plate, of which I'm going to keep a secret from most until I&nbsp;can post pictures when it arrives. It won't be for weeks, but I'm so totally stoked, I can wait. 

So, amazing concert, car in my name, yeah. It's been a pretty great past couple days. 

Now, I&nbsp;must run and finish up the rest of my day. Hope yours is going as great as mine."

I remember there was a house, an old scary house, one I've been countless times before. 

I had apparently hacked the code accidentally, kind of a fringe bonus. Been there before.


My 4th grade teacher was the leader there.

Went in thinking no one was there, but the lights still worked.

It was cold, as all not so good places are. (and that, my friends, is grammatically correct. *shiver)

Then all of a sudden they came around in droves, and stole my cup. IT was a chalice of some kind. I forget why they took it, but his son or daughter or someone saved me at the last minute as I slide down to my death on what looked like a bubble slide. Apparently pushing down with enough effort bounced me up and kept me from sliding, giving me a second to grip the sides.

The way out was to fill the chalice with wine in order to take the elevator out.
Someone had always told me the elevator was broken, but they insisted that it had always worked. They joined me with their chalice and was walking me over when I was beginning to wake up.

Apparently since I was willing to take the place, or since whoever saved me was willing to save me at risk of themselves, it's hard to remember, but since we were willing to give up ourselves, when we got to the top, there was a big party celebration, congratulating us and saying ""we were now members"" or something. then I woke up, or at least that's as much as I can remember at this point. 


It's odd how familiar the place seemed, like I've dreamed and been there countless times before."

On an upnote, went to an opthamologist today. Nice guy. We talked college football. You know, after he had looked at my retinas. 

I also asked him why he chose going into becoming an eye doctor, vs you know, feet, or the mouth, or ears, or any of the other amazing choices.

He told me he enjoyed surgery, but the hours sucked, and he didn't like the idea of going to work at 1 AM, so he decided to go into eyes instead, as the hours were better. 

How amusing, right?

He then went on to tell me ""You know, a few years ago, it used to be quite the lucrative profession. You had to remove a cornea or something, you got something like $5000. Now a days, it costs like, $500.""

It was one of the most random and ridiculous conversations I've had to date.

We went to Epcot. Had a blast. Bought Fantasia mickey ears. Looked amazing.

Walked around, it was probably in the mid 90s. Went to Misson: Space and waited in a half hour line for a simulated space flight to Mars. It was pretty cool. I was the pilot, liz was the navi and heather was the engineer and commander. Walked out and headed to the cultures around the globe. Saw some fake Beatles (don't worry kid, they were pretty awful), thought of char and her obsession for british men, moved on to France, ate some french croissant ham and cheese, saw some masques in a masquerade shop, walked a little more, made it to japan, stopped and watched some woman making candy figurines with her hands. Was beautiful to watch the dragon she sculpted. Was dehydrated, stopped and sat inside for a few to cool down, bought a clam to see what kind of pearl I could get, got a size 7 (whatever that means), it's pretty. Couldn't find a setting I really wanted. Felt better, got walking again, went to Kenya, saw some guy carving statues then and there, admired them for a bit, walked and saw other, went to Norway, stood in another long line to go on a little boat ride where we were attacked by trolls. Got out, stood in some midway point for what seemed like forever with no possible exit until they finally opened the doors and everyone skipped the pending educational film just to get out. Went to Crash car simulator where we rode really, really fast at sharp turns, etc. ate various times in between
Went to 3-d ""Honey I shrunk the audience"", tried some awful pop flavors from around the world, (the winner we thought was Israel for their lemony beverage, we did this in the beginning, sorry for out of order), um...watched some effing cool fireworks and went home. That's all I can think of at the moment, Liz and Heather will no doubt assist me in remembering more. Called some people, others called me, talked with my family, felt loved, had a great birthday, and am having cake and ice cream with my adopted family tomorrow. Got home, peeked in the fridge...first thing I said was ""Wow, that looks amazing."" I'll be sure to get a picture. A great start to the new year for me. I'm now thoroughly exhausted, my calves are killin me, and I'm getting to bed. Goodnight. Happy birthday to me. *smiles*"

little reminders. Thinking of someone when you're not even trying. Knowing you'd do anything for them without thinking twice. Feeling your heart melt at their smile. Stuff like that.

That part of you when your soul ignites, and destiny screams to your heart telling that no good this true could ever be wrong.

When you notice how amazing your loved ones truly are.

When you truly appreciate the gifts, the possibilities, the little wonders.

Most of the time, we don't realize these blessings until after a great tragedy.

I felt it tonight.

Eternity isn't long enough, but would you risk doing it alone?

I learned an important lesson tonight, sitting here, being weird, thinking.

My love isn't about being perfect. It's about the fact that I'm hokey. That I'm lazy and lost, and a badly humored punny awful human being, and loving me anyway. It's about knowing that special kid in your heart is the most anal retentive individual you've ever met. That she says dorky little nicknames for everything and that she may not be a supermodel, but her smile lights up the sky and her laughter, as ridiculously obnoxious as it is, could move storms, could move mountains, could move the distant, the lost, the cold, to a place so many fight for. 

How about love?

It's just her. It's all of you.

Some of you I may never see.
Others I may never hear from.

...my family, that I chose with a whole heart to be a part of me, and me you.

I screw up a lot, I know.

I ask a lot of you, I know this even more. 


I swear to God I appreciate each and every one of you. 

Thank you for helping me. Thank you for putting up with my shortcomings.
Thank you for spending that extra dollar on me, and thank you even more for spending that dollar when it wasn't an extra one.

"event","It's that time again. That's right, it's my quarter annual LJ post, or some bs like that. 

There's a lot we've missed, so let me see how fast I can cover it (UPDATE: In case you're curious, this post took me an hour and ten minutes to finish)

-My mom tried to get back with my stepdad, who had left for a while. He moved back in for about a month or so, she realized it wasn't working out, and made him leave. 

-Richard has since come and gone. He's my brother. I love him, but he's still the same guy. He's a nice enough guy, but short of being brothers I'd never talk to the him on any regular basis. Still, we're family, and I'd defend him as such. (He called me annoying. It was a reminder of why I didn't enjoy him necessarily being around.)

-I genuinely fell in love with a girl, and got used to her being around, and miss the comfort it brought me lying next to someone. I watched the Price is Right with Drew Carey (Don't. It's awful. Seriously), ""The Feud"", and every once in a while got up to make breakfast. I cooked some. Chicken fettucine alfredo, ravioli, chicken fajitas, tacos (my brother's welcome home party), etc. I miss peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and Larry the Rhino (not hippopotamus). Most of all, I miss her more than she'll ever know. 

-As mentioned in the previous statement, I've recently come into love with cooking. I made a delicious mango salsa chicken fajita deal a few nights ago. Seasonings = love. 

-Prettyface and Andrew's wedding reception. I promised her I'd be there. It was awesome. We played Bang. I took out two bad guys as the Deputy, then died. I served my purpose well. Andrew and Christen are quite possibly perfect for each other, and I couldn't be happier for them. It meant the world to me that I could be there. I nearly got carded for sweet champagne, which, by the way, waaaaaayy better than dry. She's one of the people I'll miss the most. 

-I met a nice girl, who, without my knowing, completed a trio of which I didn't even know was in the making. She's talented on a level most people will never know, and is one of the most amazing people I have ever met. I've known her maybe 2 weeks, and there's nothing in the world she wouldn't do to help me. Like, ""hey, I'm going to set my life aside to see to it yours is straightened up"" kinda help me. She packed us a care package. It nearly made me cry. We went to Old Chicago's and ordered lots of food. We got fat. It was delicious. Slept some of the most amazing sleep in this lifetime, and then we went to breakfast/lunch at Panera (which I was having for the 1st time.) We hugged, cried, and went our ways. Which way is that, you ask? 

-Um..well, that brings us to the main event: I moved. Moved? Yes moved. Where? *looks at his hand, to point somewhere* Nope. That's not gonna cover it. Puzzled? You should be. I'm currently sleeping in Tampa, Florida, where's it's been averaging in the mid 70s. 
We drove down from Detroit to Tampa, I-75 ALLLL the way down, making stops in northern KY, TN, GA, northern FL and finally ending here in Tampa. 

We went to, and I'm completely 100% serious when I say this, Big Bone Lick State Park in KY. It was beautiful there. Saw bison. Took pictures. Even bought a t-shirt, just so people would believe me. 

I've been horseback riding (rode bareback and doubled. Liz's horse kicked me, and I wasn't even on her. She was aiming for the nearby Joe the horse, whom I WAS on. He also, some time before that, took us riding sideways; it wasn't fun. Later did barrel turns, leaving me 3/4 off. I decided it'd be safer to bail off, as I knew I couldn't right myself. All in all, it was...interesting.) 

I went to the beach a few nights ago. It was breathtaking. 

Heck, today I helped in building a bookcase for the little bit of space I have to put my junk. It's homely. Tomorrow I hope to stain and finish it, and maybe do more in making another in the near future. 
Here in Tampa? This house is pretty big, with a kitchen so well stocked...it's fairly unbelievable. I'll send you a picture sometime of what the place looks like from the outside.

I learned a few days ago to ground through a tree, later that night at the beach, and the next day, through a moving horse. I'm growing. It's invigorating. I push myself hard, and try to run before I can crawl, but I'm working on it. 

Words flow like a river from my fingertips in phrase and strength I didn't know I had. 
The days are becoming weirder by the second.  

Oh, and for any who may be curious or amused to know? 
There's no public indoor smoking in the state of Florida, with rare and few exception.

I miss many. Many, many many many. Many many MANY of you. Too many to mention. It's likely on my day of departure I called you. I just..it's crazy guys. I'm not homesick, simply homeboy sick. Yes, that was awful, and probably made all of you groan or eye-roll or something. I don't believe in goodbyes, so find me. Call me. Most importantly...
don't forget me. I truly believe those of you whom I love and adore are family. Please. Just..remember me. I won't let you down. 
 
If you ever wondered if moving halfway across the country was a little intimidating? 

It is. Don't let it stop you. Ever. 

Coming here has already changed and bettered many lives, including my own. It's a scary, surreal process that if someone told me 2 years ago I'd be doing, I'd have laughed at them and called them nuts. 

*sigh* I love you guys. A lot. 

This post is probably the most chaotic thing..one of the most chaotic things I've ever posted or written anywhere. I'm sure it's full of grammatical errors, broken thought processes, and is genuinely all over the place. (I know it is. I read a sentence or two.) There's no point in trying to fix it. This is how it is for me lately, and will most accurately tell you and show you how I feel. 

Life's stressed. I'm worried about family, about finances, about my education, about my future. Know what though?
This is what I needed. This is where I needed to be. I've been frustrated and thinking about it, over and over and over. I've debated it, I've worried about it, but you know what? I've grown so much in the past 2 weeks..more than I ever thought I could so quickly. 

I realize this will change my life forever.

I know it's a risk.

I'm scared, too. 

I'm making it through. It's frightening, it's new, it's intimidating as who knows what, but I won't quit, I won't give up. I won't fail you, I won't let you down. 

Truly, God knows how badly my heart aches and misses everyone, and longs to hide in the norm of familiarity. 

Please, don't pity me, don't worry for me, simply..I don't know, what's something I'd do in this situation? Tell a joke? 

Give me some kind of feedback. I don't care what kind of off the wall, random ridiculousness it is. 

Keep it positive. Keep it honest. Mean what you say, and say what you mean. 

I won't forget where I come from. 
I won't forget my family. My home. 

I won't forget You.

      Love, 
          Andrew."

Went to my mom's for mother's day. I mowed the lawn, as she, in her past two attempts, has burned her arm on a hot motor (she apparently didn't realize it got that hot), and stubbed/jammed/broke her toe when finishing the mowing the 2nd time. I told her I'd better do it so the third time she doesn't die, as she's insanely accident prone.


...Kayleigh left for Mackinac. I'm pretty sure that girl misses me almost as much as I do her. Don't tell her. She'll just lie about it anyway.

I played Final Fantasy XII today to keep my friend Prettyface from catching up tooooooo much to me in the game. 

I'm reading a book called ""The Big Over Easy"" about the death and criminal investigation of Humpty Dumpty by Detective Jack Spratt and Sergeant Mary Mary.  It's amazingly well thought out and brilliantly written. I suggest it highly. 

When that Buttface is gone, life just seems different. 

I napped earlier.

..I still have work at 11, and should be sleeping.

I'm not.

Bekah and I watched Moulin Rouge. It's pretty alright actually. 

I broke it down where roughly I'll spend an hour online, hour playing my video games, and an hour or so reading my book and rotate it. 

I'm tired of one thing or another sucking my life away, so I figure this way it'll get me doing other things."

"event","You know, even though she says silly things like ""patooshka"", as in ""My buttface is a pain my patooshka"", That buttface girlfriend of mine is a pretty swell kid, and it's a likely case that I might even throw that L-word (no, not like the tv show. The 4 letter one) around.

We're somethin else kiddo. 

<---equals stinkface, sparky, ""stan"" (as in ""what's the plan, stan""), stink, and *big smile* MY favorite, pookeyface. 

-----> equals buttface, butt, kid, cute girl (as in ""Hey you, cute girl""), and on occasion, cutiebutt. 

While most of these are lame, the most commonly used between the two of us are buttface and stinkface, so I'm pretty ok with that.

She's on my mind plenty, so here's to you, Buttface. 

While sickening everyone else, this one's ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL yours. 

...


P.s. and for the record, if you say ""Aw, he loves me"" at the end of reading this, I reserve the right to claim that it all becomes UN-true, and I really just think you're eye candy, and a fine, stick shiftin chauffeur. 

P.S.S. At this point, I gotta figure I'm gettin that lame lips to one side look, or just the general eye roll, possibly with a scoff attached. If a ""You're ridiculous"" or any of the previously mentioned actions occur before this point, I love you again. If you just laughed, I love you twice as much. *smile* Take care, Buttface. 
Oh wait! I take care of you. Ha! Problem solved. Done and done. *kisses her forehead* It's like we win or something! Woohoo!

<--Needs to go watch cartoons...suckas. 

By the way, if any of you happen to be in need of an update, here's the lowdown:

\Going to my Dad's with buttface for Easter

/Closing more often at Subway

\Applying to work at Costco for around $10 or so an hour

/Paying off credit card bills, almost have all my Aquinas debt paid.

\Bought new books to read for pleasure.

Oh! 

/ Finished Anansi Boys. Amazing. 

\ I eat a Spicy Italian pretty much every time I work, despite the fact that I always ask ""What do I want today?"" to pretty much anyone (including customers) within ear shot, and always end up getting the same thing anyway.

/ Read ""Civil War"" series comic books a while back. It was ok. Sucky ending. 

\Still playing a ridiculous amount of FFXII. The game log has it at 120 hours and counting, but to be fair, I also leave running for a while when I'm not actually playing, which still racks up the counter.

/Got an Atari from my grandparents who passed away. Now all I need to find is the adapter to hook the darn thing up..

\I spent waaaaay too much time playing Pokemon Rescue Squad on Kayleigh's brother Thomas' new DS. 

/I wear a ridiculously yellow T-shirt as part of my ""Subway uniform"" now, which I will continue to do until the end of this promotion (June) or until I get a new job. 

\I think my other top wisdom tooth is coming in, and it hurts when I brush there. 

/Bekah forces me to watch terrible television, i.e. Nick @ nite, and Sister-Sister. 

\I kinda rocked at Duck Hunt the other day. BIG time.  

/I karaoked ""In the Jungle"" last Thu. and sang ridiculously high, really, really well. 

Anyway, that's all for now kids. Lame TV (kayleigh sometimes call it ""the TV"" and I tease her. It's really cute and makes me smile) and sleep. 

Have a good holiday."

"event","I am. (she asked me if I was posting, she being Kayleigh.) 

So here I am, posting. I stayed up late playing a racing game last night. ""Not just any racing game, THE racing game"" she says. 

Met the people at the 9 and John R store that I'll be working at. There's only like, 2 of them, one being the ""manager"", who's like, mid twenties. 

I've been restless lately. 

Met a new weird girl. She's different, but it's okay. I'm here to help.

I bought said racing game and Madden 2003 football (which Kayleigh will brag she beat me at, but, to be fair, she was the Patriots, and I the Tampa Bay Bucs.)

Hmm...Bekah got a job at subway. It's cool.

Her dad said there's spaghetti upstairs. I'm not really going to eat it any time soon, but it sounds good anyway. I'll probably have some around 2 AM or so, when I usually eat dinner. 

I'm going to have Aquinas debt paid off soon. Be excited for me.

That's all for now kids. I'll update later..at some point."

"event","Morning kids. I've not slept yet. I've been busy being restless. Alas. 

Worked yesterday morning at 10:30. Went to sleep that morning at around 6, kinda like today. Passed out yesterday afternoon around 5, woke up around 8 or 9. Am going to work at 11 today. 

Put in my application at Star John R (AMC) theater. Am also putting in one at Lowe's, and that one at Office Depot. 

Did my taxes online with turbotax.com or whatever. 

Ridiculously easy and great to use. It covers everything. 

Am getting around $185 or so in returns. 

I got a $5 bonus on my check for recommending people to say good things about me on Subway.com about the store. Someone did, apparently, and the compliment got sent to Tracy (the store owner). She was rather thrilled. Others are sure to follow, as I seem to get more compliments as the days go on. 

Bunch of little kids have been coming into the store. Little little guys, like 3 and 4 maybe? The big sister who watches over them can't be more than 10 years old. She looks about 8. I talked with them when they came in a couple nights ago, and they came in the store yesterday during the day. Neat kids, amazing how that little girl takes care of them. 

I need to go to the bank still. 

I lose things easily. It frustrates me. A lot. It's so hard for me sometimes...

""Andrew, why do you lose things so often? Why don't you just put it in the same spot where you'll remember it??""

For all of you that don't know: Putting it in the same spot requires me remembering to put it in the same spot. It sounds ridiculous, but if I don't consciously think every time ""I'm setting this here"" and picture it in my mind, I can't find things. It's horribly confusing and difficult for me. 

Prettyface always encourages me to open up on here. Others, Kayleigh, Angel, pretty much everyone I've ever met, have done the same since I met them. I've been trying to more and more. I don't always remember. I'm bad at getting into good habits. 

Talked with Richard. He's worried I won't go back to college. Sometimes, I am too. 

I'm falling asleep with this on my lap. 

Did really well in my dart league (yes, I'm in a dart league) the other night. Was hitting triple 19s like nobody's business. I've gotta remember to take that nap before I go again this week. It did wonders.

My muse has been nagging at me. Tell Her I'm on vacation.

I had to do the Coke order the other day. It sucked at first because I had nothing to go off of, but things got straightened out. Now they'll be calling and asking for Andrew...suckas.

Kayleigh put Andrew hearts Kayleigh on her foggy window. 
I added "" 's mouth"". She called me to tell me she saw it and laughed.

Rachel calls me wanting bedtime stories. I need practice, because Al Gore, unicorns, creating the Internet, doing Rachel and the Redwoods in CA just aren't cutting it. And really, Spacey Rex didn't quite make the cut either. lol

Jenny's daughter Savannah and I drew a picture of a robot. He had a polka dot shirt, a skirt, polka dot socks, a HUGE sword, ridiculously tall hair, pointy ear antennas, a sub in the other hand, square mouth and she insisted he had a bigger nose. I suggested calling it Frank the robot, after my manager (who she knows). She absolutely loved it. 


Random fact: I get excited, and when I do, I talk louder. It's my enthusiasm. 

I play a ridiculous amount of Final Fantasy XII. The game, which is off by a decent enough amount due to my reading through my guide, has me logged at somewhere around 115 hours. Oh trust me, I know it's a lot. 

That's gotta be all. I can't think of anymore, I'm tired, and have got to be up in 3 and half hours. Wish me some good nights, *scribbles that out* good DAY's sleep. 

*waves and pushes the Post to sir_zing button, turns off the computer, curls up and passes out.*"

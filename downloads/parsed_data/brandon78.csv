"event","so it was brought to my attention that i am a complete ass.... it wasn't said but it's how i feel.    i guess sometimes i don't pay attention to what is said to me and it seems like the times i'm not paying attention is when important things are brought up and i just dismiss them.   i feel really bad about it, cause i don't really mean too.... ! 

anyway, my weekend was really good... except i burnt my finger really bad, damn fireworks ! ! !    it was nice to have laurel here all weekend, i miss her so damn much and i can't wait to move out there.    it's the only thing that matters any more, cause i'm not gonna be happy again until i am back with her.   plus i really hate it here, it sucks so bad... there is never anything to do, even though i don't go out much anymore, it would still be nice to have something to do when i do feel like it !   hey, if for some chance there is nothing to do in philly....... NYC, baltimore, DC, and atlantic city are all close, so no matter what something will always be going on..."

"event","well,  i got back into pittsburgh monday around 10:30-11:00.... i hated leaving laurel, after 10 days of being in philly i got so used to her being around and now that i'm home i feel empty again.   hopefully within the next couple weeks my car will be sold, that is the only other thing really holding me back from moving out there.. besides my doctors appointments.    i really need to get out there, it's so much better than living here, so much more to do and see.   oh well, i guess that's about it for now ! !"

"event","wow, tomorrow i'm gonna be 26, damn i'm old.   is it me or do birthdays just seem like any other day anymore?   i can't remember the last time i had a fun b-day, i know it was way before i was 21 considering i've worked the night of my b-day every year since i turned 20... which is kind of depressing!   am i not allowed to celebrate?   i guess not.   oh well....   maybe i'll go up to Tilt's for a minute after work tomorrow since it is only a minute from my house, that place is always good for a laugh, rednecks jumping around to awful hiphop....it is quite a sight to see!"

"event","well, it's official... all my friends are lame, everytime i want to go out noone ever does or if they do they want to go to the local bars.... and around here the local bars are extremely lame ! ! !    especially since i went to school with must of the people that go to these bars and i hated everyone at my school.   i really do need out of this town, and i'm glad i finally have a good enough reason to leave(and it's not cause of the bars).   hopefully everything will work out right when i go to philly, cause i need out there as soon as possible.   shit, i'm even willing to make less money just to get there, that's how bad i want to go.    so a job is my #1 priority when i get there..... i'm gonna whore myself out to every possible place there.   also finding a place to live is up there too, i have to find a decent place though... i can't live in an area that isn't nice... i'm spoiled i know, but fuck it ! ! !   oh well i guess i'll watch more ""in living color"" now, that show is so damn funny....."

"event","today has been an extremely long day...... i left philly around 1 - 1:30 and didn't get home til around 6ish.  the weather was awful, of course, and my car finally met snow after 4 years.... needless to say she didn't like it too much, i could barely keep it on the road driving through lancaster.   anyway, the drive was so depressing, all i wanted to do was turn around and go back ! ! !   it was so hard leaving, which i knew was going to happen.   i felt really bad too because i finally realized how much laurel really does care for me, i mean i always had an idea, but it finally sunk in.   i've never had anyone treat me like she does.    it's actually a nice change.   i can't wait until the end of april so i can go back out, i get to stay the whole week.... this way i can look for a job and a place to live.  because i can't stand being away too much longer ! ! !   

anyway, back to my day, got home around 6ish sat down and i guess i passed out, cause i woke up at 11 trying to figure out where i was ! ! !   so i got ready for work, which was the same as it always is.... long, boring and stressful.   then i came home, took a shower, and now i'll just pass the night by sitting here and listening to the tv."

"event","sooooo, sammy took me for a ride in his new car, a subaru STI.... now i MUST have it !!!   it's just insane, but i know if i had something like that, it would def. not be good.... considering i have a problem with speed.    but anyway, i tried going out for a little, but things just didn't seem right w/o laurel being there.   i just sat there and tried to have fun but that just didn't happen.   oh well, i don't need to be out anyway, i really do need to catch up on some serious sleep ! ! !"

"event","well i didn't fall asleep til 4 last night and woke up at 10 to the sound of my annoying alarm..... what a way to start the day ! ! !    then on the way to work shawn decided he need to start some more annoying bullshit, just cause he's an ass..... but i didn't feel like hearing it so i told him what was up, which was funny cause he didn't know what to say after that..... i'm such a hard ass, i know!    when we finally got to work the building contractor decided he wanted to change some things, which would have been fine except for the fact that we already did the cabling 2 weeks ago, assholes ! ! !   after that we ventured over to federated to do about 8 hrs of work in 4 hrs.   i can't wait til april 8th when that job is hopefully finished, but that's not looking too good.   after work i had to sit a lowes for an hour while shawn bought a trailer for his quad, so of course i missed south park.  got home had an eat attack and now i'm gonna finish my night off here on this waste of time ! ! !"

"event","lately i've been wondering where my whole year went. i didn't seem to absorb any academic information, and now it's really killing me.

i hate writing entries about school cause everyone always is complaining about it, why complain more? everyone knows it's stressful.. well, yeah i don't know. i'm just getting really frusturated with everything.

this is really the first time i've studied for the apush exam, and yeah, i feel like i havn't registered any information this year, and i don't exactly know why. perhaps i just wasn't used to how recker teaches (or doesn't teach), blech. i'm going to do terribley on this AP, and for some reason i'm really nervous about it.. i mean, it doesn't matter what i get, but i'd feel like all the work i put into the course would be meaningless if i got a 1 or a 2. oh well. it's not a big deal. i just feel like an idiot.


i wanted to stab mcauley today. she just makes me want to fucking scream and go on a killing rampage. ugh she's just so bitchy sometimes.


why is school such an anathema to me?!
i guess cause it's school, and it sucks. 

this entry is shit. 



my grandpas memorial mass is this friday. and the SATs the next day. wonderful.

why am i such a cranky bitch?"

"event","well i've been studying since about 12. or maybe 11:30? i don't know something like that.  i'm not as overwhelmed as i was earllier.. i just wish i could have calmed down and studied today, rathter than starting tonight. i guess this really wasn't a good idea. well anyway, i got some math problems done and i've mastered the first page of the review ditto (kinda) so i guess it won't be that bad. the spanish midterm is going to be horrible. :/. i made flash cards for pretty much all the vocab, i havn't gone through them yet. i'll probably do some more math and then return to spanish.. argh senora ho bag is a poop. i'm planning on alternating between the two subjects for the entire night.  i dont really think im going to sleep tonight, but maybe a will for a few hours.. but then i don't think i could wake up :/. this is what happens when i procrastinate, which is what i always do. if i studied more, i'd be doing so much better blah. i don't know how my grades are going to be this quarter, i'm predicting better than last..hopefully.. english is easy.. my US grade will be better; however, i don't think i did well on the midterm, so that might ruin my grade :(((((. math will probably be better(once again, depending on my midterm grade). spanish eh i'm really not sure.. i guess the same. french, will be high, but not as high as last quarter..and i must study hard for that midterm.. chem grade will hopefully be better than last quarter..ahh enough analyzing. no one cares anyway. i hardly care anymore. well this weekend should be fun. celebrating the end of midterms with cristina on friday.wee! and hopefully we can get in touch with krista and she can hangout with us too, cause we miss her<3<3.i miss the summer like crazy. i miss the longer days. i hate how its always dark by 5. it's really depressing. hmm i miss the heat. i miss the beach. i miss being tan. i miss being able to loll around the house all day. i miss the freedom. eee just a few more months.. about two more months till ireland! i'll be in dublin the same time as chelsea.
 so hopefully mike and i will be able to meet up with her and have an ""international playdate"".


more studying. bye"

Junior year sucks.  i am not used to having this much work. i havnt been really applying myself;my grades are not as high as they should be. i feel like a dumbass.. i just don't feel like myself lately.  i havn't been very happy at all.  i have a million things to do for school this weekned which doesn't really help... I am not even going out tonight, i'm staying here in hopes of finishing my apush journals so i don't hvae to worry about them later on.  i just talked to mike, he is pretty upset that he's not seeing me tonight... i'm being a pretty shitty girlfriend.  i'm just trying so hard to focus on school that it's hard to talk to him all the time like i used to....i have not seen much of my friends either... i guess i've just been keeping to myself lately.. 
i really miss my brother... since he is in europe i barely ever talk to him.. and he wont be coming home anytime soon; i have to wait till december.  that is one thing that i am really looking forward to., my trip to europe.

just finished  to kill a mockingbird....  good book. i liked it.. 
i have a test on it tomorrow.  Ugh, those test suck they really do.
today was okay...

school was normal...then i rushed home got ready for track and went to
the high school.  today was a track workout.. they suck.. it was really
cold..and i was tired..but it was actually pretty ok....(alright i am 
kinda contradicting myself here,hhaha)..i was doing pretty well, i think
i suprismed my coach...cause last year i didnt do distant, so he didnt
coach me(the other coach did) so he really never seen me run(even if he 
had he wouldnt have known what i am capable of cause i had my knee
injury)..he complimented me and it made me feel good...after he told me 
that i was doing good i pushed myself even more. i was glad i did
because i really want to benefit from this..and the only way i will get
anything out of it is if i try..

anyway enough of that.

i came home showered and whatnot

i started to read mockinbird but i kept on falling asleep so i went down
stairs took some meds. and drank some soda.. my mom told me that my 
grandpa(my moms father-NOT my papa) is in the hospital because he has
had kidney failure or something... and i feel horrible.. i really want 
him to be okay...

my mom told me adn then she said.. ""I just wanted to tell you because i wouldnt
want you to be-- well, if it gets real bad i will have to go down to FLA.""
..right when she said that i knew it was pretty bad.. i said i was really
sorry and i gave her a big hug..she doesnt need this right now, and neither
do i...

I really hope he is okay..it feels like i barely know him.. i do but hes just
gotten so senial that he has almost forgotten who i am...one time he called and 
he thought i was my sister,christine, I corrected him and said, ""No grandpa it is 
Katie."".. then he said he had the wrong number and i said no its me granpa, your
grandaughter.. and i cant remember what happened next.. im not sure if he hung up
or not..
i know he is great.. when i went down to visit him and my grandma (before she 
got put in a nursing home for her alheimzers)..it was in feb. and he got my
mom and i those hearts that are filled with chocolates. it was cute :)
i wish i could see him more.. but unfourtanetly they live in florida,and well we
live up here..

im hoping for the best.. i hope he pulls through. 

<b>i love you grandpa,i hope you are okay xoxo</b>

since i can say that to him directly i might has
well post it on here....

bored. i didn't really have hw tonight. i just studied for spanish.
i only have one class in between spanish and french.it gets a bit
confusing, despite the fact that spanish and french are COMPLETELY
different.it's not like spanish and italian,that would be pretty
annoying.

goddd some things are SO funny. soo soo so funny.

jason called me earlier from the video store. we talked about school
and stuff. and he got to hear my complain about soccer and whatnot

i ordered the cliffnotes for fahrenheit.shipping is ridiculously 
expensive. it was more than the book itself. ugh.

i have nothing to do right now, and i can't sleep because i 
had soda, and i am extremely sensitive to caffeine. i have 
a feeling that i won't fall asleep to easily tonight.well
i never fall asleep easily.
i swear one of these days i'm going to become an insomniac.

i am not looking forward to pract tomorrow. :( :( :(

OH YEAH i forgot..
so i had a ""talk"" with my coach jim, and the trainer jim
about my limited amount of playing time.
it went well i guess. they went on and on and i just
nodded my head. my parents were nagging me about it 
in the car on the way home. i told them i'd tell them
about it in detail later on.

blah.

15 min the whoel game. and it really makes me feel like i am horrible
and i know that is not the case, because i ahve beenplaying all summer
and i played really well.. and now that i am playing for jim again
he decides not to play me , but to play the girls who havnt showed
up in practice since last season. i go to EVERY fucking pract. i 
can get to. and i sit on the fucking bench. and no i dont suck. 
i just play worse and worse because jim just smashes all my confidence
i am so upset now, because i think that is the least amount of time
i played ever. ugh. atleast we won. but i didnt give a shit. i walekd
off crying. and i hate crying in soccer. i fucking hate it.
and i hate feelign this way. 

my dad went over and talked to jim. he suggested i do but i said 
no because i dont feel like complaining about it. i'llf ucking
show him tomorrow that i am better than that. and he already
knew i was pissed off to begin with.i dont know what he said.
but whatever it doesnt matter,

my parents are being all nice to me now.they offered to bring 
me to smithtown but i dont know.. i really want to go and see jason
but i dont know where lindsay lives, and by the time i get there it
would be like 7:30.. i kinda feel like being alone right now anyway.

i hate the fact that jim has favorites. its really fucking cute huh?
not really. i'm fukcing pissed. i drive 30 min to pract and 30 min
home all the time. and 1/2 the god damn girls never show up to 
practice and they start, and i sit on the bench. i'm fucking 
dedicated and it does shit for me. and yeah i dont suck. i played
so good this summer. and it felt great because i havnt played
so well since before i injured my knee. 

i fucking hate this."

. just got back from tryouts.

wow, i am really surprised. i am doing so well. this morning we warmed up with 4 laps, it wasnt bad at all. then we did fitness and pushups, situps all that fun stuff.. after that we did shuttle runs and nikki and i had the fastest time. then we worked on block tackles (and i was a little hesitant because that is how i injured my knee last summer) then we did defending, which is good because there is only a few of us who know what we are doing, and i am one of them.woo. i am pretty sure i will make varsity.i am actually looking foward to tonight.

tomorrow after my second session of tryouts i am probably going to farmingdale practice. so i can see katie b. i miss her, shes like my best friend on that team.. its weird cause we dont act like it all the time, but we just understand eachother.woo

i need to shower,then i am going out with my mom so i can get my watch done.

mikey is leaving tomorrow, and he takes his computer with him, that means there is going to be an upcoming lack of entries. hopefully the gateway will be fixed soon. but my dad got a laptop from work. woo. so i will be on that.

i am not as angry about not being able to see my sister tonight. I will see her on saturday. I miss her a lot. 

i am going to read a lot tonight. i figure i'll get half way through farenheit. because i like it a lot already. its really interesting. which is suprising , because i really am not a fan of science fiction.

i am soo nervous for next year. cristina , you better effing help me keep up with french. i'll be able to survive spanish. seq3 shoudlnt be too hard, math isnt my forte but i'm not that bad.social studies shoudl be pretty easy, as long as i am intersted in the topic. health and comp es. will be easy. gym is going to suck. and english h, holy shit i am worried about.

yeah so my sister just called me. she told me shes not coming home because she is too tired. bullshit she just wants to be at franks house with him and the fucking cats.i BARELY see her. and i miss her a lot. the last time i saw her was like... uhmm sunday? i think when she came home from florida..and i only saw her for like 10-20 minutes. ugh. she has no idea how much i hate not seeing her. we never do things together like we used to , and i miss that. i know that she works full time, goes to school and all that. and i hate to sound selfish but she does have a sister who cares about her a whole fucking lot. i mean yeah she is 26 years old, so i know i can't see her all the time. but it would be nice if she actually made an effort to come home occasionaly. but i don't think anyone really understands, because no one i know has an older sister who they don't see that often ,except for kk. atleast i get to see christine on saturday.i miss her so much"

"event","he's gone.

i got the call last night.

apparently, Jen woke up in the middle of the night to me crying, ""no"" over and over again. i kind of remember this. not what i was dreaming, but feeling a lot of panic and i felt like i was thrashing around.

funeral is friday. it will be a hard day, i'm sure. i can't imagine handling this without Jen right beside me. it will also be a bittersweet day, seeing as: we will go to the funeral, and then later that night be meeting with a landlord to get approved and start the process of renting a new place. moving date? hopefully the 1st of september. location? omaha."

"event","all these thoughts in my head.
all these things to do.

i worry too much.

however, i talked to my dad tonight. my dad's side of the family is catholic. my uncle's priest was over to his house last night to read him his final rights. yes, he's dying. i've known for awhile. i went and saw him a while back, it was pretty much my goodbye and closure within myself. at this point, it's an hour to hour basis.

i don't know how to feel about it yet. i don't handle death well. now that i'm older and don't think about suicide constantly, death petrifies me. i know i am full of dread. but i can't decide what emotion my brain is feeling. it's like a huge mixture. i told Jen she has to go to the funeral with me. i can't handle it alone.

in other news, much more uplifting i guess - it is almost Jen and I's wedding! i can't wait. i am a big ball of anxiousness and also excitedness as far as that goes. also, we might be making a huge first step in our new life together in just a few months. but it's not quite certain yet, so i won't disclose details."

"event","well, Pride 2006 was a freakin' blast. it really was. 21st anniversary of pride, 21 years of life for me and my birthday twin! i've decided the Pride is even more fun and a lot more interesting when you are drunk/fucked up. okay, judge me if must, but i really am not an alcoholic or have addiction problems with any other substance. (besides, i do not consider herbs a drug. it's all natural, baby.) oh, and i shall never dance at The Run withOUT glowsticks again. they gave me confidence or something.... i don't know, but i had such a blast and didn't even really get self-conscious about dancing at all. it was really great. oh, and Britt tripped my ass out so bad with hers that i had to STOP, stand still, and watch for a couple minutes. it was freaking awesome. oh and Jen dancing up on me, well.... all i can is of course i really love that! haha.

i ran into Mary again (we had ran into each other at Lincoln Pride the previous weekend), and we sat and talked for awhile. it was cool to meet someone new, especially since we've been.... what would you say - associated? i dunno - on here for so long now and the MySpace. hopefully i didn't scare her away. 

ANYWAY. Jen and I got our actual wedding rings AT Pride, and they are really beautiful and i am so happy!

and then Sunday we took the kids to the zoo in Omaha, and it was an absolute blast. at times i felt like a little kid again myself. Sunday was also Jen and i's 7 months!!

# # # # # # # #

i have decided that by preparing meals for the kids, it makes me on more of a scheduled eating pattern and also makes me just eat, so i think that's a good thing for me. just to keep me on the right path. i'm not nearly as bad about my eating issues as i used to be, for years, but yes i do occassionally slip up once in a while. but i'm still working very hard.

# # # # # # # #

SO much to do before the wedding! we've both just about got all our addresses for invitations i think. and it's mostly little detailed stuff.... but still, so much to do!

i had therapy today (i am REALLY like my new therapist still by the way - i think she's an awesome match), and we.... no, i take that back - SHE.... set some goals for me to do before next week so as to calm down this feeling of overwhelmedness that has been gradually creeping up more and more. so, they are:

- go through AT LEAST 10 more boxes in the storage unit, and condense every 5 down to a max of 1.

- print off the financial aid forms for my next school quarter next fall, and bring them in next session. she wants me to do them there for some reason, i'm assuming just so i will actually do them.

my in-the-near-future goals for myself are:

- find an old computer to be able to take apart and put back together and also study to prepare myself to take the first half of the A+ exam.

- keep working on the wedding stuff.

- i think there were probably more, but they have escaped me.

Jen and i have set this Saturday night as a date night, and i am SO happy and excited. i can't wait!"

# # # # # # # #

yesterday was Jen and i's five months! i'm so happy. Jen is so great, there are no words to explain how truly amazing she really is.

i had my second appointment with my new therapist yesterday, our first actual session. it went very, very good. she gave me some great advice about things and i'm definitely optimistic about how our therapeutic relationship will evolve over time. i was surprised how easy it was to open up to right away.

in a more general sense, i have been feeling much better lately. i had a short but good cry the other day, and perhaps that was all i needed; to get whatever emotions and been pent up, out. or perhaps my mind was just getting used to the change of seasons; my psychiatrist once told me that spring and autumn are supposedly the hardest times for people who are bipolar (although, winter can be hard usually; however, this one was very amazing!) whatever it was, i am feeling better about myself and things again.

i went to class last night, my midterm is next week - <b>surprise!</B> (i thought i had one more week.) i must now find time to study over the next busy week. i feel a little less confident because i'm not so good on the software side of things compared to hardware, but still relatively confident. i'm sure i'll be okay. i just have to accept the fact that i might now always have a 4.0 GPA. i was just so proud of myself for doing so much better in college than highschool, though.

<u>Friday =</u> my dad, Tommy, and Joseph must go get fitted for their suits for the wedding. and i must get fitted for my tuxedo. yay! (only four months left until the big day!)

<u>Saturday =</u> me, Jen, and my dad and have to get ALL of the rest of my belongings from Rick's house in Omaha. it's going to be a long, hard day. i know i have a lot of stuff left there - many, many boxes and some more furniture - but, i want to get it all. and then be completely done with that stupid fucking house, completely done with that fucking asshole, ball-less, fuckface Rick. <i>((my new therapist told me to try and not get too angry - i'm really going to try - and to think of it as a celebration. i think i will definitely try to.))</i>

Jen made me come outside and play in the snow when she got home from work, though. it was a LOT of fun. i needed it. i think maybe now i'm mostly just tired, and that is why i am pondering these things.

"event","Jen and I celebrated 3 months this past Saturday, the 11th. we also decided to celebrate Valentine's Day then, too.

i made her a two disc set of love songs i wanted her to have.

Jen took me the nicest restaraunt in Lincoln. the food was DAMN good. it was pretty much sex in my mouth.

i had planned (and with the help of her friends Valerie and Tasha, pulled off!) - a surprise for when we came home. i had them fill our bedroom with balloons (pink and white, our wedding colors) and then since the footboard of the bed is right when you open the doors to our room, i had them tape balloons to it, four of which said ""Will You Marry Me?"" because i wanted to re-propose. when we got home and they had lit candles and  pulled off the balloon surprise, i was so excited. Jen opened the door and was so surprised, i could see the tears in her eyes and the big smile on her face and it was a great moment.

however, she had planned quite a surprise for me, too. and i had no idea. while we were at the restaraunt, she started asking me if i knew much about Irish traditions - and i really had no idea what she was getting at. but then Jen got down on her knee - in the middle of the restaraunt, in front of everyone! - and SHE re-proposed. she had gotten me a ring - but not only a ring, and Irish ring - (because i am almost all Irish). she told me the story behind and then some other things and asked me to marry her. i said yes with no doubts in my mind and the hugest smile on my face, and then she put the ring on my finger.

i don't know if i've ever been happier.

just a little bit ago, i watched the video online for Tori's ""A Sorta Fairytale"". (which, speaking of, i really wish i could afford to buy the new Fade To Red DVD.) but the point is, it is metaphorically and literally about two lovers who were incomplete until they truly found each other and found love together. this is how i feel about Jen and i's relationship - i feel complete now. this is what i have been looking for all of my life, but never, EVER thought i would find.... or perhaps even deserved.

but Jen has shown me that i DO deserve it. and i only wish she knew how much i loved her - but in a way i don't know if i could ever explain it. and i wish i could make her feel even half of what she makes me feel. hopefully i will have to rest of our lives to keep trying.

as corny as it may sound, Jen really does make me want to be the best person i can be, for her AND myself."

"event","so Jen and i went to go see RENT again tonight. it's so fucking good, i love it so much. i WILL see it live one day.

the whole Angel thing hit me the first time we saw it, but for some reason it hit me even harder tonight. i don't know why, really.

my old chiropractor in Omaha let me drop in this Wednesday and get emotionally balanced, and i've been feeling SO much better ever since. (she even said i could feel free to drop in every once and awhile and they'd do it and not to even worry about it.)

but, still. it hit me hard. i still miss him. i know i always will. the funeral scene just reminded me of how i was living in Harrison with my dad and didn't have time to get back for the funeral. for a long time, i didn't feel like i had closure.

i've been doing a lot better with it. this year on the anniversary was the first time i felt like it and i was going to be, ""okay."" but the pain is still there, and i guess to some degree it probably always will be. i suppose it's one of those things that you carry around with you and it never leaves you and you just have to learn to accept it and live with it.

i might be getting some more tattoo work done this weekend. if i do, i'm getting ""<i>Angel</i>"" tattooed on my right ankle. that was his nickname (he <u>loved</u> RENT), and that's what he was to me and always will be to me. he came into my life in a time when i needed him to be there - and he changed my life forever; in ways i might not ever be able to explain to anyone else. Brad touched so many, many lives.

i would really, really love to go visit him on Tuesday when i'm in Omaha and would actually have time.

i realized tonight i never got to hear him play Tori on the piano and sing it for me. i remember i wanted him to do ""Silent All These Years.""

Jen's out with her friends right now, i can't wait for her to get home.

i had this REALLY odd dream about Drahota last night - nothing sexual - but very, very odd. <i>(okay, don't ask questions, but this is what it was: she came to visit me in Lincoln and was in the kitchen with Jen and me and i kept trying to tell her i was getting married, but all she did was get in our kitchen sink - which i don't know how is humanly possible now that i'm awake - and kept going to sleep. and i just kept trying to tell her but she wouldn't wake up. it was WEIRD.)</i> then, she called me tonight while i was at the movie. kinda freaked me out a little bit. i called her back when i got out and we talked for a little over an hour. it was soooo good to get to talk to her! i miss her so much. i hope she comes and visits me soon.

tomorrow afternoon, Jen and i are taking to kids to Omaha to go have dinner with my mom - pizza, actually. it will be good to see her before she leaves for 3 weeks to Maui. lucky her. anywho. it will be good. plus, she's giving me cash, the down payment for the reception hall, a check to get my haircut, AND cigarettes. that's like.... 4 major bonuses right there. plus, it will be good for her to meet the kids. they're so great, after all.

i'm cold.

OH! and, as i said, my last session with Karen is this Monday. i'm sure it will be a somewhat sad session.  BUT, after a few calls, i was getting kind of frustrated about finding a therapist here in Lincoln. then Jen gave me the name of a lady she used to know and i called and left her a message last night. she called me back <i>today</i>, at 8:55AM! anyway, she sounded really nice and she seemed okay with my issues. so, i have an appointment with her the following Monday, the 30th. it's kind of weird, though, because her name is Karen, too. i hope it works out with her. i'm sure if i think positively, i will be able to connect with her and it will all be good.

i just don't know which one to consider or bring up when my psychiatrist calls me back. i haven't been allowed to take actual sleep medication for about 4 or 5 years, so i'm just not sure. i guess i will just have to probably trust my doctor's decisions. he is the best doctor i've ever had. but i want something with few side effects, especially without weight gain or as one said was possible - hallucinations!

i rang in the New Year perfectly. i went to Jen's friends' house and a bunch of people came over and we partied. i drank and smoked and was feeling pretty damn good. and right at midnight, i was holding Jen and kissing her and telling her i loved her. 

i really do want to be with Jen forever. i can see a future with Jen. she is there for me in ways that no one else has been, in such long time. perhaps ever. sometimes it still seems as though this can't possibly be real - that i could have finally found what i have been looking for after all these years. but then when she looks me in the eyes or tells me how much she loves me - i know that this is all, in fact, real.

"event","so today was my last day at the ED program. (there was a possibility of seeing my regular therapist and continuing to go, at the last minute today, but i don't think i'm going to do it.)

Sarah gave me two hugs today. they meant a lot. Shannon gave me one, too. Sarah asked for my email address and said she would surprise me with an email sometime, and that she also said she had my cell phone number. i am going to miss everyone so much. they are all such great people. i will probably go back and visit sometime.

my mom and i set up the Christmas tree tonight and put pretty white lights all over it. this made me really happy, because we haven't had a tree up in a few years now. i can't wait until next when Jen and i have a REAL tree, because that will be the first time in my life i'll ever have had one.

# # # # # # # #

today was a weird day, probably mostly because of the finality of the program after almost exactly 3 months.

i'm feeling kind of sad tonight. i wish i were in Jen's arms.

and not in front of this computer screen, in a cold room."

"event","tomorrow will be my last day at the ED program. i feel like i have learned so much and gained so much and improved so much. i can't believe it's been almost 3 months exactly. it will be strange not to be there anymore. i will miss everyone so much.

it will also be weird to start seeing my therapist again, just because. maybe cos it's been so long. i have missed her greatly. 

i feel as though i have changed so much in the last 3 months, most definately for the better, i would say. i think some of it is the new mood stablizer i am on - i had forgotten what it was like to feel ""normal"" or even much better than just that. but a lot of it i think is work that i have done to improve myself, too. and i am proud of that.

friday night, Jen took me to see RENT. i am so happy i finally got to see it. it was SO good. Jen liked it a lot, too. i cried at the end. the guy who played Angel looked a lot like Brad, which was kind of hard and probably what lead to me crying more than anything. but i have finally started to come to terms with the whole Brad situation, so i haven't dwelled on it too much. now i just need to see RENT live. i <i>hear</i> it's coming to Omaha next year. we'll see. if it does, i'm there.

saturday night, i fell down the stairs at my friend Eric's place in Lincoln. apparently, i just don't get along with stairs in general. i landed on my knee, very hard. i played it off that i was cool, but about an hour later i realized that i had messed it up pretty good. its swollen up and not a natural color. then, 2 or 3 hours later, we got in a car accident. it wasn't bad by any means, but it was still an accident. it was the other people's fault, really. i was not in a state of wanting to deal with cops, as i had been smoking (which is probably why i fell) and drinking. Eric and his friend got out and Eric's car had like no damage, the other car's bumper was totally smashed in. we soon discovered they were drunk as fuck, WAY worse than any of us. they didn't even get out to check their car - they just told us not to worry about it and then drove off. thank god. 

but because of that, my neck and back got pretty fucked up. what's new, right? so i was at the chiropractor for an hour and half today getting a new scan done of my neck and back, getting adjusted (the noise my upper back made was almost deafening, it seemed), and getting laser treatment on my knee, neck, and back. i have to go back wednesday after school.

# # # # # # # #

i just, feel really good about life right now. i feel as though i am doing SO well. i am taking better care of myself and am more healthy just in general. i am back in school, which means i am back on track to getting my degree. then i will just have to get certified. and then i will find a job out there somewhere in the computer repair business. i am a geek and proud of it. i have been dealing with things better. and god, i am SO happy with my Jen. she is so amazingly wonderful to me. sometimes i just can't believe the things she does or says because they are so nice. yes, i am very much in love. i do know i need to work on being more open with her about some things. because she's right - if i can tell her i love her, i should be able to tell her anything.

i took that first step Sunday morning as we laid in her bed. i talked to her for awhile in much more detail than ever before about the whole ED program and what happened to get me there. when we were done, she said, ""i don't know what it was that started all of that, but you don't need to worry about it because you are so beautiful just the way you are."" it really meant a lot. being with her as raised my self-esteem so much. and she cracks me up, which is always good. i can't believe how happy she makes me.

i will probably be moving to Lincoln early next year. i can't wait.

the dietician at the ED program made me her meatloaf tonight for dinner just because i asked for it cos it's SO good. she found out that my mom wanted me to stay home today because of a fall she took last week on the parking lot of her because of the ice and is now having complications and is in a lot of pain, but that i came to the program today just because she was going to be making the meatloaf. apparently she took this as a huge compliment. which is good, because it's damn good meatloaf. she even sent the rest home with me! i am almost done with the program, and it will be sad to leave, but i feel as though i have made amazing progress.

i have an appointment set with my regular therapist for Decemeber 8th, and i am excited to finally see her again.

Thanksgiving shall be here soon, so i hope everyone has a great one.

i need to start planning out Christmas gifts.

my neck is messed up from a fall <u><i>I</i></u> took in Lincoln on some concrete steps last week when it snowed and was icy. i went to the chiropractor yesterday and have to go again tomorrow. i've been feeling a migraine coming on since a couple hours ago, i'm assumming from my neck being so sore.

i still need to shower, finish knitting the hat i am making for Jen, and check my bank account balance. yep.

i can't wait for Jen to get here.

i went backwards trick or treating at the mall with two friends. then one went home and i drove the other to a party at Laura's. i had a pretty good time there, but i think that perhaps i partied a little too hard. i think that maybe that has been the problem the last two days, emotion-wise, anyway.

but, it was a holiday. and i was a pirate. and i had fun.

i'll just have to work through this. i don't exactly think it was completely the partying that did it, anyway.

November is always such a hard month for me. i miss my Brad something terrible. i laid in bed last night and sobbed about it. i broke down in front of my therapist at the ED program today about it, too. (among other things.) perhaps i'll never completely understand why he did what he did. it's just, we made a promise to each other. and so that hurts. but i know he's watching over me though, he is my angel.

i think she is so great, and the program has helped me so much. i am, however, anxious to get back to seeing my regular therapist.

"event","the pumpkin patch turned out to be great fun. the bonfire was really great, too. i'm a big scaredy cat and managed to yell an obscenity at the top of my lungs in a children's haunted house - (FUCK!!!!). Meg laughed her ass off at that, though, so at least i could provide some entertainment. i'll admit, it was pretty funny. then we headed to Laura's house and ""relaxed"" before watching Sin City. i didn't make it all the way through, though, i got too tired. it was a fun drive home, let me tell you.

(i seem to have lost track of days somewhere along the way.)

at one point, it must have been Friday, Meg and Britt and i headed to The Run after going to see Prime (which was SO good, and i'm so glad i got to see it on opening day.) anyway, i couldn't make myself dance at The Run, but Britt couldn't either so i wasn't alone. i wanted to, i just froze up. the only time i was comfortable dancing there was when i was heavily under the influence of something and had someone to dance with. but anyway, maybe next time. i went out on the dance floor, so maybe i'm getting there. either way i had fun because they play good techno and i got to play pool which i always love. too bad it really was dead.

last night i got dressed up in my pirate garb and went to a party with Britt, Meg, and LeAnn. we left at one point to wander around the Wal-Mart in our costumes. i ran into my step-sister. it was funny. then we made our way back to the party. afterwards, we went to Perkins to eat and then to LeAnn's to watch <i>Pirates of the Carribean</i>, which i had never seen and wanted to. i'm glad i did, it was pretty good.

today my mom and i went on a search around town for a couple hours trying to find pumpkins. we finally did, and we came back home and carved them. both of ours turned out really good, i took pictures which i'll have to post sometime soon. 

so tomorrow is Halloween and hopefully the awesomeness will continue.

my low back is killing me, as it is ""that time."" it feels a little better right now as i popped a few Advil, but still. i had cancelled my chiropractor appointment on Friday morning to sleep, and i kind of wish i hadn't, but at least i have one set up for Tuesday night.

i think this new mood stabilizer may really be living up to all that it's supposed to be. i didn't even get that depressed before i got my visitor this month. not compared to the usual. that's like, a first. i'm excited - i'm not even at a ""therapuetic level"" yet.

i am okay. my brother, however, is in quite a bit of pain. he was hanging out at a park and fell pretty hard on his arm. he came home and he could barely move it and he said it was getting worse so i took him to the ER. they did x-rays. they said it's probably deep muscle bruising or a sprain. but he's supposed to go for a follow up somewhere because there could be a hairline fracture that they missed. it's pretty swollen. so now he has to wear a sling for a week, and it's his right arm (he's right handed). i feel really bad for him. he thanked me for taking him, and that meant a lot.

i don't know how he's going to work. blarg.

"event","seeing Eric again was great! i had so much fun, too. we didn't end up going to IHOP, but we went to Nobbies where he got accessories for Halloween - (he's going to be a ninja!). then we went to Goodwill and each got 3 records. i got one upon his suggestion, so we'll have to see what it's like. then we went to Wendy's to grab something to eat because we decided we were hungry after all - and it took for freaking ever. i'm not even kidding. then i took him to a bar where his friend works, because that's who was driving him back to Lincoln i guess. so it gave us a chance to talk some more. i had a very good day.

perhaps i will visit him in Lincoln sometime soon. i always get lost there, though. hm.

now i just need to figure out what <i>i</i> want to be for Halloween. Eric thinks i should be a pirate because i would get to have lots of cool accessories to play with. i don't know yet, though.

i went putt-putting on Friday, and i also did some fast pitch batting cages. it has been a long time since i've swung a bat. those balls were really fast, too. and ever since i woke up yesterday, i have been SO SORE. oh my goodness. my left shoulder feels a little better today, although i still can't lift it that high. my back is slightly messed up again - and my chiropractor just had me stabilized again. i'm sure she is going to love me. but my right wrist and my left side hurt the worst. it hurts to cough, sneeze, sit down, and laugh. and i laughed a lot today. i didn't think i was THAT out of shape! jeesh. hopefully i'll feel better tomorrow.

well, i'm going to go order those two new Tori bootlegs now. yay!

then i think i will try and get to bed early because i am already dreading getting up at 6:15AM tomorrow morning. blarg.

oh, and how did i lose my copy of Sarah McLachlan's ""Afterglow""? i have no idea. but i really want to listen to it lately, and i cannot find it anywhere. damn."

"event","my friend Eric from western NE that i knew when i lived there for a year with my dad, is in Omaha this weekend. he called me just a few minutes ago. i am going to go pick him up from where he is staying, as he doesn't have a car with him right now. then we are going to go out to eat at probably IHOP (damn that no smoking rule on sundays!), and then go to Nobbies and check out the Halloween costumes. i am so excited. i haven't actually seen him in well, years, probably. and he's such an awesome guy. he's funny. and i miss having conversations with him about stars and blackholes. <i>haha.</i> anyway, as soon as i get done printing out these directions to where he's staying, i must go get cleaned up and ready to go.


and i'm sure that IHOP isn't in my diet plan, but what the hell. it's a celebration. or as my brother would say - doing his imitation of Kanye West - ""it's a celebration, bitches!""

hahahaha. yes. okay then."

"event","i should have written this almost a month ago, as soon as i got back from CO. however, i got busy with a lot of things and didn't get on the computer for quite a while once i got back. i know i'm not going to be able to write as descriptive about the concert as i would have right after it, so i'll have to keep that in mind for the future. anyway.

the concert was fucking amazing. quite frankly. it was my third concert. and although the first one i went to will probably always be my favorite, now that i think about it, this one came pretty close. Red Rocks was unbelievably gorgeous. Laura and i got there that morning at 5:30AM. so we had quite a long day, and i was past exhausted by the time the concert was over. after 2 or 3 hours of being by ourselves, we slowly found others there for the Meet and Greet. so we spent most of the day socializing with them, and it was great. toward late afternoon, a bunch of people from the last one we went to showed up - which was a surprise - but i was so happy to see them all again. next thing i knew it was a mad dash towards the area where the M&G was to take place, and after all the hiking i'd already done that day i almost didn't think i was going to make it. but, i did. Laura and i got seperated because i didn't realize that she was so far behind, and i had my phone off, but when Joe and i spotted her we stopped and waited. by the time we got to the barricade area, i didn't think that i was going to get to talk to Tori again. i really just wanted her to get my letter, so it was almost time for her to leave and right before she started talking to someone in front of me, i totally spazzed and just blurted out her name. she smiled and held up a finger as to say ""hold on."" i just kept thinking, ""oops."" but then she pointed at me and i stepped forward and she was very, very nice. i got my picture taken with her again and she autographed my lyric booklet from ""The Beekeeper"". when she asked me how to spell my name, i kind of.... well, forgot. but i did manage to get it out. Laura got a picture right at the moment and Tori is kind of laughing - it's really cute. i told her that if there was any way that she could play, ""1000 Oceans"", it would really really mean a lot. when i was done, i somehow ended up with Laura and i's letter back in my hands. a really nice guy (who i forget his name, i'm so bad with that), handed them to her bodygaurd for us, though. i am still very appreciative for that. 

then, a bunch of us went out to eat at California Kitchen pizza. it was really good.

then it was back to Red Rocks. the seats Laura got us turned out to be excellent - 8th row, pretty much center - except for the drunk girl sitting next to Laura. i just tuned her out as much as i could when she got loud a few times, because well, Tori was performing and that's all that mattered. i, personally, have never seen Tori perform the way she did that night. i thought she was in great form. she seemed very playful, playing really high on the piano that night. she even did a little dance during the intro to ""Goodbye Pisces"", which was very cute. the covers were great - ""Wild World"" and ""Let It Be"". i was happy to hear everything she played, but ""Spark"" was a good surprise for me. and i was SO happy to hear ""Cooling"". and she played ""Running Up That Hill/God"" on the organ, and i'd never heard of RUTH before, but i had chills while she played it because it was so intense. and ""Silent All These Years"" was wonderful, also. when she played ""The Beekeeper"" at the end, she reached out her hand towards the audience as she sang the second to last line, (""one day, i'll be coming for you, babies""), and i got chills all over again. it was so powerful for some reason.

i kept telling Laura that i felt that this concert was going to be almost like a spiritual experience because of where it was and all. and as she was playing, it really was for me. it was a gorgeous, beautiful night outside. and the wind was blowing through Tori's hair, and it was just. wow. like a dream. but, it really did happen. and that's quite amazing.

<i>**<u>edited to add:</u> Tori didn't end up playing ""1000 Oceans"", but that's okay. it would have meant a lot to hear it, but hopefully there will be more opportunities in the future. and, i got her my letter and that was very important to me, too.</i>

i just saw a couple days ago online that one of the six official bootlegs Tori is releasing this fall is from the 4/19/05 concert in Denver, CO. i am SO happy about this. seeing as this was the first time i met Tori, i was AT that concert, and she played 3 songs from ""Under The Pink"". i will probably be ordering it tomorrow. i have already ordered the first two and i'll probably get the other that was just released, too.

now, if only she released the Red Rocks show."

"event","When the drama among my family was powered by Xanga, I swore off Internet blogging. However, today I was just so damn bored with the Internet that I needed to spice it up a bit. I have posted previously private entries and will continue to do so when I deem necessary...but for today, what the hell? Anyway, I felt significantly less tired today. I wonder why that is. I was in a pretty good mood all day....I met some worms (named Seymour, Cranston, Herbert, and Melvin), planted some flowers...good times. Tonight I'll probably just chill (most likely eat food) and watch the American Idol finale (*cringes*). Yeah yeah...whatevs. My social life is nonexistant lately. Not that I'm really complaining...I come home at night too tired to think about going out and doing something pointless. There's nothing to do around here anyway. If I had no job, I'd be doing the same thing every night anyway...at least now I'm not getting seriously bored. Sigh...I do really want to get out of H-town though. I am so tired of the family situation...I love them dearly, but someone is always fighting (with each other) or yelling (at me). I miss B-town. Ambi and Dill and I talked about getting drunk this weekend with our leftover Smirnoff...I seriously hope we do it. I haven't been drunk in awhile, and I miss it! 

On a happier note, I <3 my friends. :) That's the only good thing about being home. Hanging out with my girls, who are always there for me no matter what. I <3 them so much, I don't know what I'd do without them. 

There's nothing to do tonight. Maybe I'll go shower?"

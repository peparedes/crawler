id ask the inherently self-depricating ""what am i doing with my life"" question, but i already know the answer. im doing what i want. 14 year old me would be stoked. not that im doing the same thing (cause 14 year old me would think that was boring as fuck) but that im doing what i want to do on my own terms.

ive got some social velocitation going on. three years in milwaukee has made faster. carbondale takes its casually. no need to rehash it out. no need to worry about it. unfortunately it seems that will all this extra time, theres nothing to do but dwell. and the last time it got like that i loaded up a van and moved 8 hours away. 

but even without any real plans, im enjoying myself. ive just got to get motivated. theres no reason to not accomplish all the ideas i have. its like ive ever reached for the stars to begin with. but im sure if i did, id get what i wanted eventually any way.

i just need some touchstone between here and there. with all the moving around over the years, ive never had that. well, i did for a while in milwaukee when carbondale started moving up. but then they just became milwaukee. well, started dating milwaukee and stopped hanging out. or simply moved back.  

at least theres summer. swimming and shows and bike rides and tattoos and travelling can turn a down man up. or least turn an empty day into a life's milestone."

"event","i cant help but have countless cliches run through my brain as i right this: ""full circle,"" ""square one,"" ""right back where we started,"" etc. But the truth of the situation is, its not the same as it used to be. my moving south to carbondale isnt the same now as it was back in 2002. how could it be? nothings the same except the circumstances. and those circumstances arent even the same. 

the circumstances that are the same are the ones that helped me move to milwaukee in october of 2005. but the difference between now and then is far beyond dates. i never would have thought about moving back to carbondale a few months ago, yet here i am, packing up my van with records and a copy machine ready to store my things in various peoples homes all across the town. 

itll be nice though. im thinking of making myself a little map with clues, then drinking a bottle of whiskey and taking some klonopin and having myself a merry little stagger of a scavenger hunt. now where did i leave that copy machine? 

but i suppose the best thing about my moving is the fact that im not as much excited to do it as i am relieved. it really does feel like going home. for once i have no grandiose plans to spill in every ear i can find. in fact, my plans could hardly even be considered plans. moving with no place to live and no source of income doesnt quite qualify as well thought out. 

but really, does it matter? for once i know exactly what im getting myself into. im sure there will be some new surprises waiting for me (oh you didnt hear? we finally burnt lost cross to the ground! it was magnificent. you could see god smiling for miles. the cops even bought us a round of drinks at PKs), but im not to worried about that. im more ready to start focusing. ramble a little less. hold em. fold em. and just maybe, just walk away.

yeah. i know. crazy.
i havent crushed on someone in a long time. and in all honesty, i didnt really crush on megan until after we started seeing each other (which was rather right away). there wasnt really time for the butterfly nervous glance crushing. nor room for it, considering she lived in LA at the time. none of that i-hope-shell-be-there-when-im-there-and-i-can-make-a-sorry-excuse-to-talk-to her kind of thing.

"event","LONDON (Reuters) - About 16,000 words have succumbed to pressures of the Internet age and lost their hyphens in a new edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.

Bumble-bee is now bumblebee, ice-cream is ice cream and pot-belly is pot belly.

And if you've got a problem, don't be such a crybaby (formerly cry-baby).

The hyphen has been squeezed as informal ways of communicating, honed in text messages and emails, spread on Web sites and seep into newspapers and books.

""People are not confident about using hyphens anymore, they're not really sure what they are for,"" said Angus Stevenson, editor of the Shorter OED, the sixth edition of which was published this week.

Another factor in the hyphen's demise is designers' distaste for its ungainly horizontal bulk between words.

""Printed writing is very much design-led these days in adverts and Web sites, and people feel that hyphens mess up the look of a nice bit of typography,"" he said. ""The hyphen is seen as messy looking and old-fashioned."""

i really didnt do much of anything yesterday, save helping jamie out with some homework assignment. we got drunk and stoned and hung out at her place while she asked me what it was like growing up in america with immigrant parents and whatnot. it was pretty damn fun, actually. plus i got to listen to the owls album, which i havent heard in years. damn. i should really pick that LP up sometime.

i should probably head to the library in order to finish typing up some zine stuff to print out. but i probably wont. once we hook up my copy machine to a computer here in the house, shits gonna get hyphy. 

erin just bailed on me about the sea and cake show on friday. i dont really want to go to chicago by myself and pay $21 (plus gas and food) to see them. i could somewhat rationalize it if i was to be going with someone else. but theres no way im doing that alone. just not worth it. but then again, i would have more money to go to that beirut show the night before. plus i wouldnt have to ask for the day off from work. hopefully jackie and i stop playing phone tag and actually get to talk about that show. id like to see her, since shes driving all the way up from carbondale.

"event","this is the first time in i dont how long that ive been listening to music while on the internet. adam smasher is out of town, so i feel more comfortable hanging out in his room on his computer. (his computer is the only one in the house - that is until we get the ""public"" one when he gets back from NYC.)

anyway...

sometimes you sit around. and you wait. and wait. and wait. hoping that something will come out of everything and make sense of it all. drugs. the last drop of that next bottle. this imagining of her next kiss. but you know just as well as i do that it never comes with that. it comes from nowhere. sudden. striking. and with such a torrential fury that you have no choice but to let it wash over you and permeate until there is complete saturation.

and thats where i am.

i am sitting in a house in milwaukee, wisconsin. this is the third house i have lived in in this city. this fact blows me away. three houses here. two houses in carbondale. before that, the dormitories. one apartment in chicago. one house in libertyville. one in vernon hills. before that, well, i dont remember. ages one until two were spent in a condo in mt. prospect, illinois. memories of pictures exist of it. but no memories.

look at that history. im removing myself, house by house, month by month, year by year, life by life, from my previous self. and its be so subtle. unknowing. how did i get here. this is not my beautiful house. this is not my beautiful wife.

before i realized it, i grew up. not in maturity, necessarily. in responsibility. and im about to have to deal wih issues that will have reprocussions for the rest of my life. goobye capricious youth. farewell reckless abandonment. welcome stoic logic. thank god you're here sober rationality.

well, maybe not you.

theres still too many drinks i have yet to regret. too many bridges that still need burning under the absolution of alcohol.

but how many times am i going to have to go back to realize that i need a kind of balance? what kind, i dont know. but some kind. 

because you know youre going too far when you have dreams of people you havent talked to since the great lunchroom fight of '95.

""we keep beginning again and again..""
what the fuck is wrong with me? really. honestly. somebody let me know. what the fuck is my damage? how many times have i had to put my foot in my mouth. my brokenhearted apologies dont live forever, you know. some morning everyone is going to wise up. and by sunset that day, im fucked. righteously fucked. 

because theres no excuse. and the english language doesnt have a word somewhere between ""sorry"" and ""dejected."" so how am i supposed to explain that i did the best i could? the best under the circumstances. those being myself and my surroundings, of course. what else do i have? going for me, or otherwise. 

not much.

jesus christ. i have never felt so in debt to prayer and god as i do right now. right. now. it seems like as much of a possibility as anything else. i mean, whats the worst that could happen? 

fuck. i know exactly what it is. and im terrified of it.

its this state. geographically and methaphorically. so what am i supposd to do when i drift across state lines like a uncertain migrant worker, constantly looking for the most stable next quick fix. 

it seems like id follow a bad idea to the death right now. because its better than anything original that im thinking of. it just seems like im regressing years and years. back to a point of affectated depression. or perhaps it was just the era of the slow death of naivete and privelege.

i dont think ive been this frightened before. normally, all possible results of a situation are weighed out. but now. well, its just not possible. too many factors out of my hands. too many variables. its no longer solipsistic worry. lives are irrevocably changing. irrevocably. god fucking damn it. 

welcome to a new existance. one that i had complete control over. one that was molded by action, inaction, and discarded memory. everything will eventually be recalled. whether by you or someone else. so it is. so it has come to be.

tomorrow morning i will wake up just like any other day. but tomorrow night ill go to sleep different.

this is know.

this scares the ever living shit our of me."

"event","scamming copies is one of the best feelings in the world. especially when its 80 copies of your zine. that feels rad. thanks non-specific corporate retail chain!

so i started working my job at captel. and while it isnt the most fun job ive ever had, its definitely the best job ive ever had. thats probably why its the biggest scene job here in milwaukee now. at least 20 people i know work there. and theres more waiting for the next training session.

for those who dont know what i do (which is probably most of you) let me break it down:
i caption telephone calls for people. people in the service of captel have specialized phones with a text display monitor. think of stock ticker. something like that. well, its my job to be a 3rd party on a telephone call and re-voice a partys conversation so that it appears in captions. kind of like closed captioning for tv. the thing is, instead of typing out everything that people say (which would take too long for thecaptions to be all that effective) we use voice recognition software and simply dictate the coversation. its all high tech and shit.

pretty sweet, actually.

basically im a corporate voyeur. i get to hear all kinds of conversations all the time. and one of the things that i do like about it is that you only get to hear one side of the conversation. the side youre supposed to caption. so i find it fun to make up in my head what the other people are saying. a fill in the blanks or mad libs. 

its also not constant work. you get a phone call every couple of minutes. not incessantly. and lets say you get a phone call that lasts over 45 minutes, they wont give you another phone call for 10 minutes or so. and during those randomn lag times in between calls, you can do whatever you want. read books. play gameboy. play chess with the person next to you. write a zine. layout a zine. collate and staple a zine (which is what im planning on doing tonight). yeah. it fucking rules.

the other nice thing is the benefits. training pays $8.00/hour. starting salary is $9.50/hour. plus you get an extra $0.50/hour on saturdays and sundays. holidays (which are all federal/state recognized holidays) are double pay. after 90 days of employment you get 3 weeks paid vacation. full time is only 32 hours a week. full timers can get health, dental, and vision.

fuck yeah. best job ever. now lets just see how fun it is."

i started practicing with a new band. in all honesty its not as much of a band as it is rob. its only the two of us so far. but finding a bass player and a second guitarist shouldnt prove to be that hard.

instead of working on the next issue of my zine, i made up a bunch of letters. by that i mean i made some art on envelopes. envelope art is amazing, and has always been a passion of mine. i like cool looking things.
im simple.

it looks as though megan might have an apartment. well, she finally got the chance to see one. luckily she liked it. its also relatively cheap, in a good part of logans square, and is available immediately. so theres at least one option. right now shes checking emails and messages about other places. probably myspace and the pop punk message board too. 

i picked up some sweet records at reckless. a mob 2xLP, an ambition mission/vice dolls split 7"", and the new defect defect 7"". between that, the records i got during mauled by tigers, and the zines ive acquired, i have 100% media satiation. 

randomn thought: i really need to pick up my copy of the new MRR from justins house. id like to read the chinese telephones interview in it again.

aside from my panic attack and ridiculous freakout the other night, things are going okay. ive had great moments of clarity and revelation lately. self-awareness is key, im learning. maybe i should make a zine about it. ha. im not funny."

"event","i am currently sitting within the inviting confines of the gloriously large Harold Washington Library, in wonderful downtown Chicago. ive got about 7 1/2 more hours to kill until Megan is done with her school orientation. Columbia College Chicago. Its full circle strange for me.

im sitting here recuperating from the insanity that was Mauled By Tigers Fest. what a fucking insane weekend. just like the fest, only without the bullshit. i managed to see: lefty loosie, the potential johns, canadian rifle, vena cava, the arrivals, toys that kill, pink razors, tulsa, the bananas, underground railroad to candyland, abi yoyos, hunchback, future virgins, and i heard party garbage and this bike is a pipe bomb from outside. im sure im forgetting some bands. but whatever. 

megan, daryl (who works for razorcake) stayed mostly with good ol kevin krunchie. there was one night were we crashed with mike and jimmy sass dragon, but thats cause we stayed up all night the night before drinking at a 3 AM bar with dierker, johnny misfit, harvox, galaboff, chris cagel, kirk, and dale. yeah. i know its strange.

things seem to be getting better with megan. thats always good. nowhere near perfect. but maybe a smidge better. and some improvement is better than none, ill take what i can get. baby steps.

anyways, now daryl and i have to kill the rest of the day. it wouldnt be so bad if i wasnt completely broke. zero dollars. not even enough for train fare. if i had that much, then at least we could go around the city and look at chinatown, or record stores, or book stores, etc.

theres another ridiculous show tonight, this time in milwaukee. so were going to try to make that. then tomorrow theres the bear proof suit/annihilation time show. friday theres the abaddon show. egads. i hope i survive.

and i hope i dont actually have the ear infection that i believe ive contracted."

"event","finally. after how long, i now have steady access to the internet. now i can finally start writing shit down again, lest i forget. and forget i do. often.

tour was...well, not that fun. there were some fun moments, obviously, but overall i feel as though i would have much more enjoyed myself here in milwaukee. it was really nice to be able to hang out with fletcher and brett for a while, but besides that and going to washington DC, nothing  really mattered to me. let me take that back. those two things, plus making a new friend in balitmore - the ever so lovely ms. cristy road. crucial latino punks united! everything else was superfluous. 

but yeah. tour wasnt fun. i was considering quitting the tour, and the band, the night after the first show in cincinatti. i guess i still am. it just seems like a job. not that fun. there doesnt seem to be a lot of reciprocated respect when it comes to dealing with things as a cohesive band unit. not a lot of wishes are respected, or even considered. so yeah. im not sure whats going on. i guess ill figure it out. but for the first time since joining the band i have no qualms about leaving it. i guess im more questioning why im feeling this way more than anything. we'll see where that leads.

and on what i hope is a better note, megans moving to the midwest this week. she leaves LA today, and the expected arrival day is thursday. things arent going so well right now. downright shitty even. meh. ups and downs. manics and depressions. things of that nature. its been long confirmed that im a fuckup and insane. but until recently, i thought i could get by with that. it turns out that maybe i cant. maybe i need to rethink my strategies. coping skills as well.

oh, let me also tell about how i found my room when i got home from tour. my entire stereo unit was pulled out. the speakers were laying on the floor. books were strewn about. there were piles of records everywhere. my bed was covered in dirt and general debris. and when i tried to play my turntable, it didnt work. well, it does work. for a little bit. it just stops working about 3-5 minutes into every record. so its pretty much functionally broken.

god.

whats the worst that can happen summer '07 is very much living up to its name. 


sidenote:
most noteworthy parts of tour.

1: smoking a joint rolled in a page of the bible on the capitol steps.
2: smoking a joint rolled in a page of the bible in front of the FBA building.
3: getting hella stoned and going to Ford's Theatre and seeing the gun that killed Abe Lincoln.
4: eating ice cream with cristy road and joe III during the blackout in baltimore.
5: seeing T.F.A. play in a collectives basement in baltimore.
6: cramming ten guys in our van from connecticut to boston because dear landlords tranmission exploded.
7: watching a 250-300 person bloods vs. crips gang riot in binghampton, ny."

"event","megan and i went to the los angeles county museum of art yesterday. they have a ridiculously thorough exhibit of rene magritte. i was fucking floored. i even got a print at the gift shop. (in full disclosure, megan got me the print.) in the same exhibit they included works influenced by magritte. some of them retarded and dumb, some of them amazing. i got to see some amazing lichtenstein pieces, some rad raymond pettibon, and one of my favorite barbara kruger pieces. after the exhibit, we meandered about the musuem checking things about. i gawked and fawned over the caravaggio syled dutch paintings and the japanese netsuke.

from there we ventured to the santa monica pier for skeeball, whac-a-mole, air hockey, south park and addams family pinball, dance dance revolution, and photobooth pictures. i told becky i would bring her back a baggie full of sand from the pacific. when i finally got to the ocean, there was no baggie to be found. damn my luck. damn my eyes.

beyond that, things are in a strange strange land. i fly out to milwaukee tonight, and i still dont have a ride from the airport. damn my scumbag friends not even waking up before 10:30 AM. im not sure if i even work on the day i get back. i guess ill find out soon enough."

"event","things are strange right now. despondent, maybe. out of control, possibly. normal? no way. theres those perfect hours of no need for consideration. minutes of comfort. then evenings, mornings, afternoons where mouths make graves. there are things that once learned can be so easily forgotten. once memorized and etched in heart can never be recalled. 

bite your tongue.

you can do something out of malice that can never compare to something by way of accident. so judging one against the other wouldnt yield the most exact measurements. its better not to bother. 

hold your breath.

right now were trying to figure out what exactly our pre-pedro plans are going to be. maybe go see watts towers. maybe not. most likely though itll involve doing taxes and eating food. maybe ill start a new book. one of hers, most likely. makes more sense to read something i dont own, than something ill have forever.

-


October 20, 2006
At Valhalla House, Milwaukee, Wisconson

SGD: So here I am, I've got an interview with Chinese Telephones from Milwaukee, Wisconson.

Ray: He's just making this up.

SGD: No it's going.

Ray: Imaginary.

SGD: It's going.

Ray:There's no microphone.

Random Person: Don't listen to him, he doesn't live here any more.

SGD: Shut the fuck up.

Daniel: No matter what, I'm not responsible for that murder.

SGD: Yeah, that's fine.

Daniel: 9/11 had nothing to do with it. It was all this guy.

Random Person: 9/11's a joke!

SGD: Say your name and what instrument you play.

Ray: Ray... uh.... and Bass.

Daniel: Raphael James Opperman, Guitar.

SGD: Who would you say is your biggest influences?

Ray: The Cure. (long awkward pause)

Random background person: That's not even a joke!

Ray: Dan's mom.

Random Background Person: She's dead.

Other Random Background Person: Innapropriate.

Ray: Dan's dead mom. Clint. Not you Clint, but other Clint. And also YOU Clint.

Catherine (In the background): Ray's Mom.

Ray: Who else?

SGD: So the fat Clint and the fake Clint?

People In Background: (screaming and fighting)

Ray: Heather...

Daniel: Ray, did I ever tell you I slept with your mom?

Ray: No. Heather Blotto!

SGD: Heather Blotto is awesome.

Daniel: But she was never in the Blottos.

SGD: Yes she was!

Daniel: Oh, she was? That's where her name came from.

SGD: Yeah.

Daniel. Oh, never mind. She was never in Blotto.

SGD: No, she was not in Blotto.

Ray: So she's not Heather Blotto, she's Heather Blottos?

SGD: No their called Blott..., it's like, Al Blotto, Heather Blotto...

Daniel: Of the Blottos?

SGD: Yeah.

Ray What about Blotto?

Daniel: I heard of a band that did that once, called, like, the Ramones.

SGD: Oh yes, Los Ramonase?

Ray: Yeah, they played at Lost Cross the year before I moved here.

SGD: The thing is that The Blottos had their punk last names as Blotto. No one can explain it. Really.

Daniel: Were they as good as Midnightmare?

SGD: They were way better than Midnightmare.

Daniel: I listened to Midnightmare on MySpace once, and that's why I thought Acts of Sedition wouldn't be that good, cause I didn't reall like Midnightmare.

SGD: You can't possibly compare Midnigthmare and Acts of Sedition. Cause I wasn't the drummer.

Ray: Ask another question and stop having a conversation.

SGD: It's the best kind of interview.

Daniel: Ask her why she married Brock.

SGD: Ummmmm... No.

Ray: Anyways, continuing...

SGD: So I think you guys sound kind of like Sludgeworth, what do you think of Sludgeworth?

Daniel: I really like Sludgeworth, alot.

Ray: It's funny, because I like Sludgeworth more than I like the Methadones, and more than I like Screeching Weasel, and more than I like the Riverdales.

SGD: Oh, definately, I think Sludgeworth is way better than Screeching Weasel.

Daniel: Oh, duh.

Ray: I hate Screeching Weasel.

Daniel: I don't hate Screeching Weasel, I used to hate Screeching Weasel, but due to the fact that I don't hang out with dumb pop-punk retards all the time any more, I've gotten to the point where I'm like, all right, How To Make Enemies and Irritate People is an all right album. Like, Sludgeworth is awesome, Screeching Weasel is a band that exists.

SGD: What do you think about the pop punk scene in the midwest these days?

Daniel: It's pretty fucking stupid and overdone.

Ray: What? There's a pop punk scene?

SGD: I don't know, is there? Tell me.

Ray: No.

SGD: So there's no pop punk scene.

Daniel: There's us, [and] this band with a guy who looks like Freddie Kreuger that talks too much... [Modern Machines].

SGD: Wait, a dude who looks like Freddie Kreuger, with his face all burned and shit?

Background Person: They stole my van!

Daniel: But there's another band called Period Three that's a million times better.

Ray: Did they steal your van?

Background Person: Yeah! They stole my van!

Daniel: I didn't know that.

Background Person: The Modern Machines just fucking stole my van!

Ray: According to Jim from Quest for Fire, the Modern Machines just stole his van.

SGD: That's amazing.

Ray: And the funny thing is that his brother is in that band.

Jim: They came into my house, took the key, took the van.

SGD: All right, next question. Were gonna start with Ray...

Daniel: The next question is how is Jim gonna deliver Shepherd Express next week?

SGD: No, fuck that.

Ray: Way to have a job, No Job!

SGD: Ray, what other bands have been in, in the past, before Chinese Telephones?

Ray: Umm... I was in Panic Disorder, and that was just stupid, it was drunk

Daniel: Hey, pop punk's for faggots, oi oi oi!

Ray: It was more of a bet than anything, and then I was in It Burns, which was actually good, we sounded like Zeke. And then I was in a bunch of shitty pop punk and emo bands before that.

Daniel: You just said actually good, and sounds like Zeke in the same sentance.

Ray: Dude! Zeke is awesome!

SGD: Allright. Daniel James, what bands were you in in the past?

Daniel: I was in Master Heartache for awhile, and we were more of a Sabbathy band, but it was like, you know, GOOD. I was in Motorcycle Prom Dates... oh and uhhh... one time at Robot House...

Ray: I was like... so drunk...

SGD: You remember that one time at Robot House when I was wasted?

Daniel: One time at Lost Cross...

Ray: What's that supposed to mean? What does that mean?

Daniel: I am Rayas El Bumpia!

Ray: This is the worst interview ever!

SGD: No, it's the best interview ever. Trust me. You speak English very very good!

Daniel: Oh, if this is in MRR, can I say fuck Tim Yohannon, and I'm glad he's dead?

SGD: Yeah, we'll see if they print that or not.

Daniel: They'd better, fascists! Edit this! You can't edit this! The revolution will printed in MRR! Fuck you!

SGD: (singing) Women In Uniform! (pause) Ray, do you want to be Dan's girlfriend?

Ray: No!

SGD: Dan, do you want to be Ray's girlfirend?

Daniel: I would, but I'm gay.

SGD: He would, but he's gay. Oh, Catherine, what do you think of Chinese Telephones?

Catherine: I think they're totally tits.

Daniel: Except, she really hates my Grandma.

Catherine: I love her!

SGD: That's cool. So what I have from you guys is the 7"" with all the binary code on it, the split 12"" with... uhh...

Ray: Potential Johns

Daniel: And the split 7"" with Dan Padilla.

SGD: Is that all the shit?

Daniel: We have a 7"" coming out any day, we just got the test pressing from Japan, it's a split with Anti-Justice.

SGD: Anti Justice?

Daniel: Yeah, it's a Japanese band. Yeah, and we're also recording a 12"" next month.

SGD: A full length 12""?

Daniel: Yes.

Ray: We're recording with Jeff and Mark from the Marked Men.

SGD: In Texas?

Ray: Yeah, we're actually spending Thanksgiving down there because both Dan and Justin go to school full time, and me and Gorky just work...

Daniel: Gorky goes to school also...

Ray: Yeah, but not full time. So pretty much our whims as far as our band activities are based around school schedules, so due to the fact that there's Thanksgiving break, I have to spend my Thanksgiving in Denton Texas, with a bunch of people I don't know, instead of my family and friends.

Daniel: I kind of want to spend Thanksgiving with my family too, but we need to have our record out when we go for our next tour.

SGD: Fuck ritualistic American activities.

Daniel: I think killing a bunch of Native American people in the name of fuckin' European...

Ray: Turkey!

Daniel: Yeah, turkey. Not the nation of Turkey...

SGD: In the name of the animal Turkey.

Daniel: In the name of the bird that we eat.

Ray: The bird that should have been our national mascot instead of the fucking bald eagle. Benjamin Franklin wanted the turkey to be the national animla, because he though it was a proud animal...

SGD: It is...

Ray: It wiley, and it can survive in the wild, by it's self, it did not have to adapt, it was amazing. But the bald eagle was a bird or prey, it was a carrion bird, like a vulture! And vultures are not what America stands for!

SGD: It shouldn'ta stood for that but it does now.

Ray: No it doesn't, it stands for cheap gas, good labor, and a product you can trust... USA! USA!

Daniel: Do you know what I learned from our Finnish friends today, Clint?

SGD: What did you learn?

Daniel: It is time for me to get hard on you!

SGD: I love you guys.

Ray: Hey, I wasn't done yet!

SGD: All right, contunue.

Ray: USA! USA!

SGD: Shut up. So I heard you guys are going on tour to Japan.

Ray: Yeah we're supposed to be going next spring. The only problem is that we're all poor and we have shitty jobs. Justin delivers pizzas, Dan actually doesn't have a job, he just takes loans, and spends them. And I work at an Irish Pub. Which is weird because I'm not Irish, and, well I'm not Irish, that's why it's weird.

Background Person: I AM Irish!

Ray: Well nobody cares about you right now. But yeah, we all have shitty jobs, and we might not be able to afford it, but besides that, it'll be rad, because we got invited, and... I'm sorry Rachel, I love you!

Rachel: I love you too, and I love this guy. What's your name?

SGD: My name's Clint. How are you?

Rachel: I love you. My name's Rachel. You rule.

Ray: All this better be in MRR, word for word. Anyways...

SGD: If I can do it, I will. I'll try.

Ray: You gotta be pro. You gotta be like Lester Bangs. You gotta be like the DIY Lester Bangs.

SGD: That's what I'm going for.

Ray: Like Lester Bangs meets Kickboy style Slash magazine shit... Anyway, the record label, Snuffy Smile, it's a Japanese label, they've been doing really good splits, where they take one basement American punk band, and pair it with another Japanese band. Modern Machines did a split with Blotto, Altaira did a split, I can't remember who else, I think J Church did, all these really good DIY, hard working dudes kinda bands have been putting out these split seven inches. And Yoishi, who runs the label, is awesome. He puts out the split seven inch, then books you a tour. Where you pretty much pay for the air fare, go over there, tour, and come back. A vacation mixed with a tour. And the fact that he's picking up these random fucking fuck up drunks... he picked our band and he's like 'You should come to Japan and do what you're doing in America, but in a country that you would never go to otherwise.'

SGD: What bands do you want to play with in Japan?

Ray: I'd go with The Because, but they just did the tour with the Modern Machines, they're fucking amazing. I want to play with Mummy the Peepshow. They're this all girl, Japanese pop punk band, that's the closest thing to Riot Grrl, super pro feminist lyrics, the closest thing you'll find to Riot Grrl in Japan, which is such a macho, masculine dominated society. Here's a bunch of women who are married, with children now, playing really awesome, bubble gummy, 1-2-3-4 shit, but with Kathleen Hannah style lyrics, the most introspective, socially aware lyrics. I wanna play with them. My old band did a couple shows with them in Chicago, when they were in the states, and it was fucking amazing. They just put out a new album, maybe a year ago.

SGD: Is Japan gonna be your first foreign tour?

Ray: It'll be all of our first foreign tours.

SGD: How many tours have you done so far in the US?

Daniel: I wanna say we've done the west coast three times...

Random Party Girl: (unint.)

SGD: Fuck you!

Ray: Why don't ya go back tah San Fran-Cisco!

Random Party Girl: I'm just teasing you.

SGD: I love you, you know.

Ray: I can't shotgun beers cause I throw up.

Lasse (from Hero Dishonest):Clint, I don't want to shotgun a beer, I want some hard liquor.

(At this point a break was taken in the interview to shotgun beers)

SGD: Daniel James, what are your feelings on shotgunning beer?

Daniel: Usually I'm pretty good at it, but my belly is full and I can't handle more volume.

SGD: It's hard to drink a whole can of beer in five seconds sometimes. What do you think, Ray?

Ray: I can't shotgun beers, the carbonation makes me puke.

Daniel: Carbondale-ation...

SGD: You're from Carbondale Illinois, right?

Ray: I lived there for awhile but I""m not from there. I might as well be ""from there.""

SGD: Fair enough. So last time you came to the west coast, you brough a bunch of 24/7.

Daniel: What's the worst that could happen?

SGD: For people who don't know, how much does 24/7 cost in Milwaukee, and how much did you bring to the west coast?

Daniel: I think it was 69 cents a can, I can't remember.

Ray: It's called 24/7 because it's 24 oucnes of 7 precent energy malt beverage.

Daniel: Seven percent alchohol, but's it's also an energy drink.

Ray: Pretty much it's in between a sparks ands a sparks plus, and it under a dollar. So Justin, he delivers pizzas for a Pizza Hut in the suburbs, and at the nearest liquor store, because he would get off work, and go buy booze, and come back home, he found this thing called 24/7, and it was when it first hit the market.Ity was 69 cents a can, and he bought a six pack, or he didn't buy buy a six pack, because they don't come in six packs, but he bought six of them, and he loved them, and he brough the word back to Milwaukee.

Random Background Person: Ridin' Dirty!

Ray: A case of it cost like, eight bucks?

Daniel: 7.99 or 6.99... 6.99 for a case.

Ray: So we all started drinkin it...

Daniel: For a twelve pack, but it's 24 ounces so it's like a case...

Ray: Pretty much when we decided to go on tour, we thought we were gonna have to bring our own booze with us, so we bought the rest of the cases from the store, we bought the store out, we each brought like three, or two...

Daniel: I brought wo twelve packs... we each brought wo or three...

Ray: So we brought about one hundred 24/7s with us on tour.

Daniel: I quit drinking 24/7 in Oakland, because well, if you pour 24/7 in a glass, it looks just like radiator fluid, like thsi glowing green neon thing.

SGD: I think Eric Apnea said he said he drank 24/7 a bunch and then took a shit, and his shit was acutally green.

Daniel: That's funny because that's why I quit drinking it. I took that shit in the warehouse that you live in. You were asleep, I woke up on your couch...

SGD: You took that same shit...

Daniel: And it was neon glowing green, and I was like, I ain't gonna fuck around with that shit anymore.

Ray: We were in San Pedro, and Dan was taking a pee next to a bonfire, and he's in the middle of peeing, and I'm nearby...

Daniel: It's funny that you remember stuff from San Pedro, cause I don't. All I know is the video of me being naked.

SGD: How did that happen?

Daniel: Soemone had a video camera and I was naked in view of it.

SGD: Was it because you were wasted?

Daniel: I'm never wasted, I'm straightedge. Hey, uh, keep a positive dental outlook!

SGD: I heard that part of the Chinese Telephones lifestyle involves getting extremely wasted, all the time. And not only have I heard that, but I've also experienced it.

Daniel: You just read that on the internet, liar.

SGD: Because every time I see Chinese Telephones I end up getting extremely wasted... with them. Go explain that, OK?

Daniel: go back to San FAG Cisco you PC loser!

Ray: Well the thing is that we all live at houses that have names, and when you do that, there's a good chance that you're going to be drunk by the end of the night.

Daniel: Apparently this isn't policy in the Bay Area, but in Milwaukee, when you move into a house, you actually name it, whereas in the bay area you have to actually earn your name, so your house jsut ends up being named after the street you live on.

SGD: Yeah, it kid of sucks, becuase the recent punk houses in the bay that cropped up, I didn't actually live in any of them, so itn wasn't my responsibilty to actually name any of them, even though I have a plethora of punk house names lkodged in my brain.

Ray: Like what?

Daniel: Quit interviewing yourself!

SGD: You're right, I'm sorry.

Ray: No I wanna hear this, like what? What do you think we should call it if we had a house together...

SGD: Let's see, Rock Bottom...

Ray: Oh, whatever dude, The Terrordome!

SGD: The terrordome?

Ray: And the theme song would be welcome to the terrordome by Public Enemy. That's why you live in the bay, and I live in Milwaukee.

SGD: The Pit of Despair!

Ray: Oh, whatever.

Daniel: My next house is gonna be called Dinobot Island.

Ray: Dan and I were gonna start Dinobot Island. Because I don't know if you're aware what dinobots are...

SGD: I'm not...

Daniel: OK, when the autobots discover the dinobots...

Random Background Person: No they didn't! They made them!

Daniel: Well it depends on if you read the comic or watch the cartoon. It's totally different.

Random Party Dude: Raaagggghhhh!!!!!

SGD: Hold on dude, I'm trying to do an interview here.

Daniel: Wait, Brock! Tell him all about Dinobot Island!

Ray: Next question.

Daniel: No, no no! This is way more important than Chinese Telephones!

SGD: Next Question. We're talking about Chinese Telephones here, OK?

Daniel: We're talking about Dinobot Island!

SGD: (to Rachel) Are you in Chinese Telephones?

Daniel: Get the fuck out!

SGD: Yeah, I'm sorry. We'll talk later.

Rachel: I'm Rachel Thompson.

SGD: I know.

Daniel: Also know as Dude It's Rachel...

SGD: We'll talk later...

Daniel: Dude it's Rachel on MySpace.com. I don't know if you've heard of this thing called MySpace, but I'm a pretty big deal. I have 666 friends.

SGD: I heard Daniel James has 666 friends... How friends do Chinese Telephones have on myspace?

Daniel: Like a billion. We're so famous, like...

Ray: Here's what happened, like the other day, Ben Weasel wrote about us in his Blog. Zero people added after that. That's how big we are.

Daniel: Because everyone was already into us.

Ray: Here's the problem, that we're so big that the people who are into us don't like myspace. Rupert Murdoch is our only friend.

SGD: What do you think about myspace, do you think it's punk or not punk to be on myspace?

Ray: I don't think it has anything to do with punk at all. I think that's a stupid question.

Daniel: I don't think it has anything to do with punk. It doesn't matter.

SGD: What do you think about Rupert Murdoch getting the rights to your songs when you put them on myspace?

Daniel: Ray, they actually just changed that, there was a class action lawsuit, and the people won, and no longer is it the policy that they can use it for any advertising whatsoever. You have the full rights to them and you can option them, if you wish, but they don't own your songs anymore. And it's also retro active, so people hwo once technically had their songs owned, now have the legal rights to them.

SGD: That's good info.

Ray: It's a moot point at this point.

SGD: What about you, Dan?

Daniel: I think Hitler rules, and...

SGD: Wait... whoa!

Daniel:Oh, wait, this isn't a Skrewdriver interview?

SGD: Oh yeah, I though I was interviewing...

Daniel: Yeah, I thought you were interviewing my other band...

SGD: Chinese Screwdrivers?

Daniel: Ummm... I meant Hitler totally sucks. And umm...

SGD: Yeah, that's better.

Daniel: And I like all people... except Hitler.

SGD: Right on.

Ray: Don't say right on! That's like the worst thing you could say! You're a fucking racisct!

SGD: No! He was like,Hitler sucks! And I was like,right on!

Daniel: No, quit being... skating totally rules, everything else totally sucks.

SGD: Yeah, S.T.R.E.E.T.S. They broke up. That sucks. Hey, no. Quit it. I'm interviewing your fucking band, not your ass. This is gonna get edited down!

Ray: We should change our names to The Yellow Jacket Telephones.

SGD: Wait, do you like to do yellow jackets on tour?

Dan:yeah, cause I can buy them at gas stations.

SGD: Well didn't you hear that yellow jackets aren't what they used to be?

Ray: Well I don't buy that cause I almost died once from ODing on yellowjackets.

SGD: Really?

Ray: Yes.

SGD: How many did you take?

Ray: Between 30 and 40.

SGD: 30 and 40!!??!! Oh my god!

Dan: I think that's why they're illeagal.

Ray: Wait so the thing is, my old band It Burns did a tour with this band, and their show before Carbondale, before the start of their midwest tour, which I had booked, was Austin. So me and our roadie thought that we could drive from Carbondale, which is by Saint Louis, and hour and a half east of St. Louis, to Austin, Texas and back, in one drive. Which, driving the speed limit the entire time, would be a sixteen hour drive. So what we did was, every time we stopped for gas, be bought a package of yellowjackets, and ate them. So, hour 26 comes by, and I have consumed six packets of yellowjackets at this point. Mybody starts shutting down, I start crying, I start involuntarily vomiting, and we have to get a hotel room just outside of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Just north. Because our roadie Brino didn't have a driver's license, he was more of just a dude who came with us. He couldn't drive. So I'm shaking and vomiting, he's curled up in the front seat, in the fetal position, saying I don't want to die in Texas"", while Journey ""Don't Stop Beleiving is blasting on the stereo. We decide to get a hotel room, we break two hotel keys because we're so fucked up we can't figure out how to put them in the door, we then go puke for like an hour and pass out. I made it onto the bed, he didn't, because he took so much trucker speed that he passed out in the bathroom in his own vomit. You CAN OD on yellowjackets.

SGD: That's the most amazing thing I've ever heard.

Ray: It's horrible. I actually called up my ex girlfriend at a truckstop, asking her why I was going to die that night.

SGD: Whoa.

Ray: Intense. I haven't heard the last of it. This was like four years ago. She still makes fun of me for it.

SGD: So who mainly writes the songs for the band?

Ray: Justin.

SGD: Justin who's not here tonight.

Ray: He doesn't need to be here. His music speaks for him.

SGD: What's he doing?

Ray: Probably stoned and watching a movie.

Daniel: That's what he does.

SGD: What does he write songs about?

Daniel: Girls, bubblegum, and right wing politics, which he's really into.

Ray: Pretty much it's the oposite of that. He writes about...

SGD: Men?

Daniel: Men, candy and left wing politics.

Ray: He has really good lyrics, they're about, not necessarily about desperation, but this kind of lifestyle that we all live.

SGD: About Milwaukee?

Ray: Well not even Milwaukee, but being in bands, shitty relationships that happen cuase you're not around, and it's nobody's fault, not having a good job, loving what you do but hating your life at the same time, because it sucks due to the fact that you're having fun... and it's really awesome shit.

Daniel: So it's not about right wing politics?

Ray: Not any more.

Daniel: So then I probably quit.

SGD: At what point do you think it changed from right wing to left wing politics?

Daniel: Probably when he started dating that black chick. And he used to be in Skrewdriver for a long time. And that's how i met him.

Ray: No he was in Jewdriver.

SGD: He was NOT in Jewdriver.

Ray: He was in Jewdriver!

SGD: They're from the Bay Area. I KNOW.

Ray: It was a different Jewdriver. Trust me, I'm not lying.

Daniel: My world history book is written by a guy named Jewsbury.

SGD: Serious?

Daniel: But yeah, Justin used used to be in Skrewdriver, and I used to be in the White Public Enemy.

SGD: Whitemy!

Daniel: Yeah, whatever, so we were both in white power bands and we toured around the country, and that's how we met Mest, because they used to be a white power band.

SGD: Wait, what's Mest?

Ray: That had a song called ""What's The Dealio"", whcih was a moderate radio pop hit.

Daniel: They're a Blink-182 type of band, but they used to be a white power band called Confederate Storm.

SGD: That's stupid.

Daniel: I was joking about that other white power shit I was saying, but these guys were serious about it.

Ray: So the thing about Mest was that they were a moderately popular band from the suburbs of Chicago, I'm from Chicagoland, and they got signed to Maverick Reocrds...

SGD: Madonna's label...

Ray: They got bought up in that whole post Blink-182 radio friendly pop punk band buyout, not as big as '94'95, but the same kind of idea for the midwest. So they got signed to thius major label, and they had a moderate radio hit with this song called ""What's the Dealio."" Like Sum 41 style, hip hop pop punk rap song and it got unearthed that, all the dudes were from Chicago, and they're older, they were in their early thirties...

SGD: Any ex members of Charles Bonson?

Ray: I Wish. Because if they were, they'd be ex members of a white power skinhead band from the South Side called Confederate Storm.

SGD: Cause I heard a rumor that there were ex members of Charles Bronson in Fallout Boy.

Ray: Fallout Boy is actually ex members of Race Trader, one of the most provocative, influential hardcore bands of the late 90's. Their drummer started fallout boy. Original drummer. He's not in Fallout Boy any more.

Daniel: Their new drummer is from Wammatosa, a rich suburb of Wisconson.

Party Dude: He was in band called Sraight Forward.

SGD: So your drummer isn't here either. Here's a chance for you to talk shit on him.

Daniel: I could actually never possibly talk shit about my drummer, because Gorky is one of the coolest motherfuckers I've ever met.

SGD: I agree. He's really good at playing all the eighth notes of a Ramones beat, and I totally admire that.

Daniel: I've actually known Gorky since way before I knew Justin or Ray...

SGD: Were you in other bnads with him before?

Daniel: Yeah, we were in The Motorcycle Prom Dates and a band called the Piston Hurricanes, which was originally called Piston Honda, before we got sued by another band called Piston Honda and had to changed our name.

SGD: Were these Milwaukee bands?

Daniel: Well, Piston Honda started out as a Stevens Point band, and then we move here, and got Gorky on drums. So yeah, they were all Milwaukee bands.

SGD: You're from Stevens Point.

Daniel: Yeah, it's in the middle of the state.

SGD: Do you have anything to say about it?

Daniel: Steven's point Wisconson makes really good beer, called Point Beer, and also the world's largest trivia contest is based out of Steven's Point, and it's the coolest thing you can ever do, and everyone should play the world's largest trivia contest.

SGD: What is it?

Daniel: It's 54 hours long, and people from all over the world come to play it. There's about 500-600 teams that play, and they ask the questions on the radio, the local college alternative station, and it fun. It's basically an excuse to not sleep for 54 hours and do a lot of drugs.

SGD: Sounds kind of like Chaos in Tejas.

Daniel: Yeah, minus the hardcore. Trivia is the coolest thing I do every year, I love it.

SGD: Have any other cool bands come from upper Wisconson?

Daniel: Well Green Bay was really cool for awhile, way cooler than Milwaukee is now.

SGD: Really?

Daniel: It used to be the Rock and Roll capital of the midwest, and when I was growing up in Stevens Point, we used to go to Green Bay, and just see every show that happened, it was about two hours away. We'd go to aplce called the concert cafe. Time Bomb Tom would just book every fucking band that existed, like bands that a lot of people wouldn't get to see because they would usually be playing shitty bar shows. But they would play all ages shows in Green BaY.

SGD: What do you thinbk was the best band from Green Bay ever?

Daniel: That I don't know, because a lot of the bands weren't really that good.

SGD: It was just the scene it's self...

Daniel: Yeah, there were good abnds that played, but they were all from small town Wisconson. The Lookers were awesome, The Teenage Rejects, who turned into The Catholic Boys, were really good.

SGD: Are they still together?

Daniel.: No, Paul has a new band called Tough Banana, and I think him and John and Eric have another band, I don't know what it's called yet, and then Nick is actually moving to Vancouver, actually, for a girl. So he gets free healthcare now, so that's pretty bitchin'.

SGD: So I'm gonna talk about something that I always forget to bring up whenever I'm in Wisconson, but my old punk band from High School, conflicting minds was on a CD compilation based out of Wisconson called ""Music To Make You Scream.""

Daniel: Never Heard of it.

SGD: Yeah, probably not. I think it was based out of... not Milwaukee, not Green Bay, but somewhere else.

Daniel: Do you remember the name of the town?

SGD: No. But I'm gonna try to remember some of the other bands that were on it....um......and I can't. But I every time I go to Milwaukee, I'm like, I'm gonna bring a copy of that, because I have like ten copies of it still, beause I have ten copies of it still,

Daniel: I would like to hear this comp, because I'm sure I know at least one band on it.

SGD: I'm sure that you do. Probably some stupid-ass band that you knew from High School. So that was kind of a pointless question.

Daniel: It wasn't even a question.

SGD: True. Well that's pretty much alI can think of to ask. Is there anything else you want to say?

Daniel: No.

SGD: Sweet. This interview is over."

"event","killing time until megan gets home from work. listened to some patton oswalt (its like being drunkenly berated by an old friend), read some jonathan carroll, and skimmed over tons of old MRRs. 

i picked up a good handful of older maximum rock and rolls at a pretty sweet record store. along with that i got the first suicidal tendencies LP, the le shok LP, a damage deposit 7"", an observers 7"", and an astrid oto 7"". i also picked up the european 10"" pressing of the charles bronson youth attack album for megan. as maddy tight pants would say: punk rock!

i missed toys that kill in pedro the other night do to a shit ton of shit happening to me that day. and now, flipping though the LA weekly, i see that i missed mika miko this weekend as well. luckily theyre playing here in LA again before i leave, unluckily, theyre opening for lifetime. a band that i dont really like. a band thats gonna make the door price for the show most likely be higher than what im willing to pay for a show. im from milwaukee goddammit! i dont want to pay more than $6 for punk show. but as luck would have it, the underground railroad to candyland is playing a house this friday in pedro. huzzah! the pink razors are playing as well, but i couldnt possibly care less about them. it would honesly be impossible.

theres a new chinese telephones song up on our myspace page. its gonna be off our new album. pretty sweet, eh? let me know.

I think im gonna make some mac and cheese now. that shit is tight."

"event","los angeles. (i only wish there was some way i could communicate through typing the exene cervenka vibratto that goes through my head every time i say that citys name.) im staying at megans for the next couple of weeks. until the 21st, to be exact. its great. the weather here isnt -28 degrees. i can go outside without dread. vacations are pretty sweet. especially when youre getting over a rather serious bout of strep throat. thanks carbondale, i appreciate you loving me so much that when you decide to disease me you go all out. the hospital visit was indeed worthwhile. 

the plans for this vacation: the tar pits, toys that kill in pedro on saturday, book stores, record stores, cuban restaurants, venice beach, the wayfarers chapel. and if at all possible, i really want to try to make it up to the bay tomorrow to see surrender play at gilman. that would make my fucking day.

right now ive got a couple of hours to kill before i head over to pasadena and meet up with megan. food and books, thats tonights adventure.

not much to say right now. im very content, very relaxed, and very much looking forward to spending time with my betrothed. ive got the internet, stacks of books, and a bass guitar here. if anyone needs me for anything, fuck off. im busy being bored and stupidly happy."

"event","i have a new turntable. its fucking great. its a front loading, dual needle/stylus one. that means i dont have to flip the record. i can also set it to repeat one side, or both sides. it even has a nice built in 45 adapter.

crap, 5 minutes before the computer shuts off.

carbondale weekend is quickly approaching. los angeles vacation is as well. leaving milwaukee will be nice. change of air. scenery. faces.

ive got myself a stack of new books from downtown books today to tide me over until then. what i did was exchange a box of old books from my parents house, ones that i havent read in nigh on 10 years, for a good handful of new books. mostly new authors that im excited about checking out. besides that, i picked up a brautigan book that i read and liked and one of the very few neil gaiman books i didnt own.\

the computer is going to cut me off soon. and my transfer expires in 10 minutes. 

its time to go."

"event","in the non-stop excitement that is my life, ive taken to throwing cards in a hat. im up to 33. pretty fucking good, if you ask me. i can now look at a deck of cards, a hat, and say with complete conviction ""Yeah, i could throw over have of those in there."" its a nice feeling. really. it is.

it snowed again. another 3+ inches. made me really late for work yesterday. not being able to bike around town when its convinient is a pain in the fucking ass. at least its locking me up in my house, forcing me to read the stacks of books i have sitting around. both post-holiday gifts and library checkouts. im currently plowing through some jim thompson books before i start on my jonathan carrol ones. then on to the the big guns: norman mailer.

im more interesting developments, chinese telephones are doing quite well. this weekend had a couple of really fun shows. the chicago one in particular. i got to see so many of my friends, from so many differents part of my life. spencer and johnny stinkpants were there. jimmy hardcore, ms. gatewood, and the ever ineffably lovely ms. erin funk-dublan. ms. e-funk just moved back to the midwest, chicago specifically, after spending a few years in los angeles. her presence was a definite surprise. i got to have a few drinks with gabe ransenberg and brittany (who are planning on moving to austin in the near future). johanna was there, johnny rushmore, issac arrival. it was pretty sweet. we even managed to make it down the street in time to catch the free chronic seizure show at the mutiny. crashed at nick and kirks. a nice evening out. saturday ruled as well. the sass dragons pulled in around 3ish. got drunk early. spent the evening drinking, dancing, singing along, being a drum brick for canadian rifle, getting high, impersonating nato paisano, and fallnig asleep.

next stop: carbondale.

but before that: work tonight, libertyville tomorrow, work on wednesday, band practice thursday, nothing to do on friday, carbondale on saturday.

and it looks like i cant get a job at the library. in order to work circulation part time you have to be an enrolled student. ridiculous. youd think theyd want people who were more dedicated to the job, and less concerned about outside factors. like grades and GPAs. 

death to false librarians!"

"event","September 18, 2004. the best day of my life! DJ and I went to San Fran to see Haste The Day and met Kamy and Zach there. It was the best show! We used all of our money and had to scrape for change just to get into the show. So, with Haste The Day playing in Roseville tonight, we were both totally bummed when we realized we wouldn't have enough money to get in. Anyways, after they played Jimmy came over and talked to us, and he's going to try and get us into the show tonight! I have never been so excited ever! Wish us luck!"

"event","so, my mom just cut my hair, guess that wasn't a good money-savvy idea, eh? oh well, it's not the end of the world, things like bad haircuts don't phase me much, there are MUCH more important things out there. so anyways, i didnt want to look at my hair anymore, so i dyed it, and i didnt want to use the gloves, yet another BRILLIANT idea, cause now my hands are so bloodshot from trying to get the dye off, and i cant even feel the heat of the burning hot water anymore. it's quite interesting actually, i love experiencing new things! hah, today was definately an adventure!"

I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord

Well if you told me you were drowning, I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend, but I don't know if you know who I am
Well I was there and I saw what you did, I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh Lord

It's the first time and the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence, oh no you don't fool me
Because the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air, I can feel it coming in the air
I've been waiting for this moment all my life, my life

I can feel it coming in the air, I can feel it coming in the air
I've been waiting for this moment all my li... fe
I've been waiting for this moment all my life, my life"

"event","While they were taking up the collection, John leaned forward and said, ""Hey, Marie, how about you and me go to dinner next Friday?"" 
""Why Yes, John, that would be nice,"" said Marie. 

Well, John couldn't believe his luck. All week long he polished up his car, and on Friday he picked up Marie and took her to dinner, the finest restaurant in Raleigh. When they sat down, John looked over at Marie said, ""Hey, Marie, would you like a cocktail before dinner?"" 

""Oh, no, John, ""said Marie. ""What would I tell my Sunday School class?"" 

Well, John was setback a bit, so he didn't say much until after dinner. Then he reached in his pocket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes. ""Hey, Marie,"" said John, ""Would you like a smoke?"" 

""Oh, no, John,"" said Marie. ""What would I tell my Sunday School class?"" 

Well, John was feeling pretty low after that, so he just got in his car and was driving Marie home when they passed the Holiday Inn. He'd struck out twice already, so he figured he had nothing to lose. 

""Hey, Marie,"" said John, ""how would you like to stop at this motel with me?"" 

""Sure, John, that would be nice,"" said Marie. 

Well, John couldn't believe his luck. He did a U-turn right then and there across the median and everything, and drove back to the motel and checked in with Marie. 

The next morning John got up first. He looked at Marie lying there in the bed. 

""What have I done? What have I done?"" thought John. 

He shook Marie and she woke up. ""Marie, I've got to ask you one thing, said John. ""What are you going to tell your Sunday School class?"" 

Marie said, ""The same thing I always tell them......... You don't have to smoke and drink to have a good time"

David and I a couple of days after his BMT graduation. I was still sick-ish, but not as bad. This was also our last day there. And my eyes blinked.

We live a little further south than the Kadena Marina. On one road trip we went to Zakimi Castle and Cape Zampa!

The Okinawa Marathon is way too similar to Ninja Warrior in the fact that some people just want attention. Not necessarily good attention. We even saw a Japanese Luigi.

"event","Hello livejournal, looong time no see. I don't even know why I randomly thought of you, but I kind of miss writing long posts...facebook status updates just sometimes aren't enough. Thought I'd update for those I've lost touch with!

Backtrack: 

Summer 2010: In July I almost got heatstroke...I had very strong heat exhaustion the day I went to my then fiance's graduation. I was miserable. But the plus to that is I got to sit with the base commander and other high up officers during the Airman's run, and during the actual graduation ceremony we got the very front row (where all of the officers sit). I felt extremely important, lol! 

I also rescued baby doves, raised them, and released them into the wild! The same day I released them, my dad found a fledgling blue jay...and he gave it to me to raise as well! We named it Norman. I must say, that was the most invigorating and wonderful experience in my life! I learned SO much about nature in that silly little bird! Yes, Blue Jays can be mean...but they can also be SO sweet. It would give me kisses, sit on my shoulder, it LOVED to play on the computer (especially farmville!) 
<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/timestreason/pic/0000kqd5/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/timestreason/pic/0000kqd5/s640x480"" width=""640"" height=""480"" border=""0"" /></a>

It also liked Cigarettes. Darn junky. One time it stole a LIT cigarette out of my mother's hand. Yeah. 

It eventually lost all of its baby feathers and grew into the most beautiful Blue Jay I've ever seen! After Christmas we decided to release her (yes, it was a her!) into the wild. For 2 weeks we let her come back into the porch and locked her in at night, and then we'd release her again in the morning. She'd hang out with other birds, chase squirlles and doves...and then come back to hang out with us. She finally left us for a strapping young male and didn't come back after that. I still miss her, but I know she's so much happier now. 

In August, my cat Kaylee developed a very serious liver disease, and the vet and I were struggling to keep her alive...She dropped weight incredibly fast, no matter how much I fed her. I had to hand feed her with a syringe about 8 times a day for a month! My entire life was keeping her alive, weekly (sometimes twice a week) vet visits, different antibiotics, xrays, exploratory liver surgery, IV fluids...and I even learned to give fluids myself at home with a big bag and a huge needle. It wasn't bad, honestly. Kaylee hated it, and I made fun of her for having a humpback...but she took it with dignity. We finally started getting progress when I started adding in milk thistle and other liver regenerative herbs. I even impressed the vet. Finally we added in a appetite stimulant antihistamine and she did an almost full turn around. Now she's back to her fat happy and obnoxious self! I love my kaykay!

In October, I married my husband 1 week after his return from Tech School. It was very lovely! 3 weeks later my husband left for Okinawa, Japan! 

In December I was tortured/had my wisdom teeth out. I was awake with laughing gas. Uh, would not recommend that for anyone. They didn't give me enough local anesthesia for the first tooth, and I literally felt EVERYthing...and lot of pain. The surgeon didn't believe me. It was <i>awful.</i> The other two weren't bad (I only had 3), except the last one kept slipping so I kept hearing gunshots inside my mouth. I was shaking, crying, and the heartbeat on the monitor was racing. Yeah. After that, vicodin didn't work, ibuprofin didn't work, tylenol didn't work...so I was in pain for a week, I hardly got out of my chair (with my baylee laying on my chest the entire time). I went in again and they shoved clove oil soaked cotton into the holes. DISGUSTING.

After that, I sent in my paperwork to my husband, and we got my tickets for me to move to Okinawa, <b>Japan!</b> I arrived Jan. 30. I LOVE this little island, and I love the locals just as much! I did not care for the little bit of Tokyo I saw (I HATED that airport), but Okinawa is incredible. This is more home to me than HOME. Since I've been here a couple of months now, I still only lightly miss my family...my two cats I miss more than anything. But I should have them shipped here in the fall. 

We've done a bit of exploring, but there is SO much left to do! Good thing we're here for another 2.5 years! I also love my friends here. I have more friends here than I ever had in the states. It's an incredible feeling of knowing I have a support group of people who are in the same situation as myself, and they understand me! 

Married life was difficult to adjust to at first, because in the beginning...well, we lived with our parents for the first 3 weeks, then he left and we were back to not only long distance, but 7000 miles apart...Christmas was not easy, and I was depressed for a long time. The flight itself wasn't bad. Well...the first one was the scariest flight I've ever had. We were on a prop with 2 engines. Half way to Dallas one of the engines blew out. I was in the very back and got to hear the attendants freaking out. Lucky me! Way to start the trip. Other than that, no more adventures in flight.

Now David and I call our 2 bedroom Tower apartment home on Kadena Airbase. I'm learning the base really fast, and off base even faster! I use any opportunity to go off base! Driving here isn't bad either, even if it is on the wrong side of the road! I also love our SUV...it's small for an SUV, but it's on the big side here on the island. It's a bit of a pain to park in the tiny parking spots, but ah well! It has 4 wheel drive so if I want to I can take it off roading...woo!

Tomorrow our first shipment of goods will be delivered...ie, kitchen ware, bedroom stuff, bathroom stuff, clothes, games, dvds, OUR XBOXS. YES. 

Oh, and we got a Kinect! It's SO MUCH FUN. It's a workout all on its own. Love it!

I think this is all for now...I don't know if I'll get back into the habit of journaling or not. But it was nice to do a recap and look back on my life. It's been going great for once...I have amazing friends, a wonderful husband, a home of my own in freaking JAPAN, where I've been wanting to go for years now. Life is good, and I feel God smiling upon me. 

I hope everyone that reads this is doing well, too!"

"event","My life has recently changed a great lot. I realized what a completely secular life I had been living, and how sick I felt (mentally, physically, spiritually) and that I had to do something about it. I was claiming to be Catholic without really being what being a Catholic truly is. Yes, I went to Church EVERY Sunday. Yes I believed in all of the Church's teachings. Did I fully practice them? No. 

Being a Christian (and I say Christian, not just Catholics) means more than just believing. We have to actively promote our faith, if not through word then by action. Actions speak louder than words. 

Example. Saying your blessing before you eat. It's awkward to go out to eat with non-believer friends and you're the only one who says a blessing before meals. Catholics will start and end their blessing with the Sign of the Cross, a visible reflexion of our Faith. And an obvious one. Even friends have looked at me weird like ""What the heck?"" whenever I preform the sign of the cross before I (silently) pray over my food. But they won't bother me about it. They show respect to my belief and to my practices and in return I respect them and theirs (or their lack of). 

Recently, I decided that my soul was in need of a serious overhall. On Saturday, directly after work, I went straight to Confession. Confession is one of the Church's seven sacraments. For many non-Catholics and even for a lot of Catholics, Confession is a strange and uncomfortable idea. Confessing one's sins is not easy for anyone. Many Catholics will opt out of Confession on the terms that ""It's between me and God."" Confession IS between the confessee and God. The Priest is one of God's many hands/feet/mouths/ears. The priest represents God in full, and God gives him the grace to bear and Forgive so many burdens that are released during Confession. I can honestly say that after going to Confession on Saturday, after not having been for over a year, was a very large Elephant off of my shoulders. Not only did I feel healthy in SPIRIT, but in mind and body as well. It is amazing how much sin can effect your body. It is even more amazing how forgiveness can heal.

Since then, I have been regularly praying the Liturgy of the Hours (also known as the Christian Book of Common Prayer) as well as the Divine Mercy Chaplet and even the rosary. God has truly blessed me in my search for Him and my desire for spiritual peace. 

I think that I will be pursuing another form of prayer as well, though. Meditation is, for me, one of the best ways to pray. It is, again for me, the best way to grow spiritually.

I found an old book of mine titled 'The Imitation of Christ' by Thomas a Kempis. On the title page, there are a few selections from the text.

""Are not all painful labors to be endured for everlasting life?""

""It is no small matter to lose or gain the Kingdom of God.""

""Lift up therefor thy face to Heaven. Behold, I, and all My saints with me, who in this world have had a great conflict, do now rejoice, are now comforted, are now secure, are now at rest, and they shall for all eternity abide with Me in the kingdom of My Father."" (Wis. 5:1)

Everyday, I will type up a chapter (they're only a couple of (small) pages each) and then post my own thoughts (if I have them) on the meditation. Yes, this is a Catholic text, however I welcome all Christians and believers to go on this journey with me. For one, it would help ME and and encourage me to keep strengthening my spirit and my relationship with God. They may be some points to which you do not agree, if only because of the difference of practices, but for the most part, Christian theology is very similar to each other. 

For those wishing to participate, I think that we need to work together to maybe come up with a plan that will suit all of our (slightly differing) theological needs. 

<lj-poll-1209534>

Please! If you have other Christian friends who are willing, tell them and invite them to participate in the poll. I have made this entry public for the time being, but I'll friend it in a few days. 

If we do decide to create a community, there will be a few strict rules. Since we will all have some differing beliefs, we must respect each other. There will be no belief smashing, only educated and respectful discussions. There will be no ""that's stupid"" or ""my faith is better"" only ""We all believe in God and we are ALL his Children,"" ect. 

That's all for now. When I have more information, I'll post it and we'll go from there."

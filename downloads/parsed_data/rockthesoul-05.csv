I really don't use this anymore except to post in several communities so I basically deleted all friends. Don't take it personally. I'm not even sure if people check back here anymore now that I'm not posting anymore. If you'd like to be re-added to see my icons/graphics, just re-comment here to be added again."

"event","<b>9 to 5: The Musical (Broadway)</b>
<i>June 10, 2009 Matinee</i>

So... I woke up extra early today but I still managed to be late meeting <lj user=decipherated> and <lj user=unlimited> at the Wicked lotto (but not too late to enter and lose). Ended up lottoing 9 to 5 and all three of us won (our names were actually all called in order too, lol) but only Courtney and I went. Justin Patterson was on for Dwayne/Detective and JLP was on for Maria.

The show started about five minutes later than it usually does start so we were anxious to see if there'd be any technical difficulties since this past weekend had the epic no-lift performance. 

Act one went pretty smoothly. Allison was extra funny today and even had Marc Kudisch cracking up during her dream sequence in which he couldn't even finish his lines. He was laughing as he fell into the pit in the floor. Also, Allison seemed to get tangled in the huge sheet (whatever you want to call it) before Megan and Stephanie joined her for Joy to the Girls. In the hospital scene she got so flustered with the Detective that she said flubbed a line which I now can't remember off the top of my head... JLP's delivery of Maria's lines was really odd. Her accent wasn't exactly what it should have been - especially in her first big scene (""i need to go back to the stone ages... and use white out""). 

<lj-cut text=""Epic set fail #1 and #2 behind the cut..."">Anyways, the real fun started in act two. Intermission ends and the scene starts up. Not even five minutes into it the office set for Hart's office didn't come out and turn onto the stage like it was supposed to. It just stopped and jammed in the back corner of the stage. The curtain drops and the guy over the intercom tells everyone that there is going to be a slight delay in order to fix a set problem. Courtney and I were actually really excited at this point to witness an epic set fail. 

About five minutes later, the lights go back down and the curtain rises to show the office scene all set up correctly. They continue as planned. Everything goes smoothly up until the scene for ""5 to 9"". First of all, when SJB pushes Margaret back into the elevator and it's supposed to close before Roz gets there, the door was a little slow on closing so SJB ended up having to flail her arms around and yelling to block Margaret inside the elevator from Roz. She had to contain her laughter behind the folder of papers in her hand since it was pretty hysterical. Then, Roz's airplane seats come out for the end of the song and instead of taking her off-stage as they normally would, they just stayed put and didn't move. 

The curtain drops and, once again, another announcement comes over the intercom. Epic set fail number two! This time we must have waited about 15 minutes before the show started up again. Before the curtain rose the guy over the intercom said the rest of the show would be continued with ""alternate staging"". The show picks up with ""Always a Woman"" and right off the bat you realize that Marc isn't rigged to the wire like he normally would be. Therefore, for the rest of the show Hart wouldn't suspend from the garage-door contraption like he should. Instead, Marc had to play everything on the ground which included him having to bunny-hop off the stage after ""Always a Woman"" (which was lol-worthy in itself), sitting in fetal position on the bed while SJB smacks him with a pillow in the scene at Hart's house before ""Get Out and Stay Out"" (since she couldn't hit the button to suspend him) and, walking through the crowd of people in the finale and exiting through the crowd of people instead of just hanging above them and then being pulled back up. Also, I think some more of the desks were pushed onto the stage by ensemble members but, I could be wrong.

Other than the problems, the cast did great overall. Megan, Allison and Stephanie sounded great. I'm glad I finally got to witness an epic set fail like this - it was definitely extremely amusing. Cast recording being released July 14! Hooray!"

"event","Oh my gosh, I am livid right now...so I got off work early (I was supposed to close, but got done at 12:30 or so)...and I came home, whatevs, figured I'd take a shower before people come over or whatevs and then decide to read the invoice regarding what our apartment charged us from our deposit.  Okay, I'm expecting it to be a little off or whatever, but there's a letter in there from Alanna's mom to Tollhouse that Tollhouse enclosed so I could read and oh my gosh, it is ABSURD...it says that the place was dirty and she spent 8+ hours cleaning when they moved out Alanna and that there were holes in the wall from where Melissa had hung things, and again she reiterates it by talking about my Christmas lights and that Alanna had to spend an hour cleaning after picking up the keys that she came out to get because I was running errands slash had no transportation besides the bus to get out to the apartment and blah blah blah...first of all, the only thing I hung up were the Christmas lights (which we put up the night of the cocktail party aka Chelsy, Alanna, and I put them up...it was a joint effort), second of all, I told Alanna I'd take the keys to the apartment because I had time and she INSISTED on coming out because she was going to be out in the area anyway, so why not pick them up, next, bull fucking shit that Alanna cleaned, much less for an hour...and if she did, why was the place still so dirty, then?  THAT my dear friends, is fucking shady shit.  AND then I'm sorry that she has no life and decides to do every fucking thing for her daughter because she thinks she's incapable or too good for that or something like that...8+ hours was her decision and by the way, it was NOT dirty when we moved out...I'm sorry, both Tanna and I are anal about things being clean (well, not anal, but when it came to that, we made damn sure that it was totally clean...and it was definitely not dirty at all...plus Nick helped me move the rest of my stuff out and we all know how HE is about cleanliness) and about bringing up my bed...I'm pretty sure they offered to do that...and then she said they offered to come up to clean the weekend before or something like that, but I'm sorry, I do NOT need mommy and daddy to do things for me...I am fully capable and competent and you better BELIEVE that I'm giving her mother a call tomorrow and with all due respect telling her what is up, because that letter enraged me...I think that it is completely absurd to say these things and she is most definitely going to get a piece of my mind, she better believe it.  And if she wants to have a conference between her, Alanna, and me, I will be there in a heartbeat so Alanna can't tell her mother lies about the condition of the apartment or anything else like that and it can all get squared away.  ANYways, I'm gonna go shower and think about all this and just wind down, because David, Ricky, Yvonne, Solomon, Hung, and hopefully Erik are coming over...and Allegra said she's gonna come home.  ANYways, I'll be sure to update this little guy after my conversation...wow, I'm glad that I got some of that out...my head hurts, I freaking swear...I don't think it's ALL this, though, because my headaches have been coming back lately, but whatevs...but yeah, have a good night!"

"event","Alrighty, so last night I went home for the evening and it was pretty chill.  Well, here's what happened...Tanna, Marisa, and I went down to Fullerton (we left around 7:45) and before that I talked to Sonia and decided that I would go down there, because, hello, free ride, you know?  And otherwise I've been so tired lately that I knew I would just stay in and not do anything...Dash and the boys had a party, but that meant taking the bus out to IV and what not, and it would just be a pain and what not, you know?  So then I went down there and Sonia picked me up in Fullerton...we went to 711 by the house and then picked up a 20 case and I got a couple of munchies because I was hungry.  Then we went over to Chapparral Lanes and met up with Gabe, Steve, Neeshan, and some other people (saw Brian Ritter...random!) and what not...then met Mike, my new friend who graduated from GHS too and who now lives in South Pasadena and what not...he's 31 (graduated in 1993) and has a five-year-old kid...he was funny and I liked him...then we went back to Gabe's and just sat outside and chilled, drank a little more and what not...then Sonia and I went home at around 4:30...then 8:00 rolls around and Tanna calls me (still intoxicated which was funny), saying they're gonna leave in a little bit and take the 57 to the 210...she calls me later on the 60 in Ontario so I tell her to turn around...then she calls me a couple other times and then when she's getting on the 210 and we were gonna meet at Denny's because she didn't want to be late to work (which is understandable, but there was no way she was going to make it to work on time because she already went on a 40 minute detour, but whatevs).  So then Sonia and I are leaving and she calls me and I'm all, we'll be there soon...then she calls me when we're at Leadora and Barranca and I'm all, I'll be there in about 3 minutes...and she's all I called you at eight, you should be here and I was all, Tanna, but you went 40 minutes out of the way...it's not like you were ready to go then and then she hung up on me!  I was flabbergasted because I didn't do anything, you know?  I take that back, I wasn't there when she and Mar were, but she acted like she went way out of her way which she didn't (and she was the one who offered to take me home in the first place, which was very nice) and that it was my fault...so now she's gonna end up working tonight, which is totally fine, whatevs...I was just really taken aback by that, you know?  ANYways, so we came back home, I backed Erik's cake, hung out...David came over; he, Tanna, and I chatted it up in the living room, then Marisa came out and then we went to Costco for lunch...then he took us back and I frosted the cake, talked to Legs and now I'm gonna go get ready for work (I'm gonna bring him his cake and card on my half and sing to him at midnight...if we're not busy, which I'm keeping my fingers crossed) and am scheduled to close!  Talk to you later!"

"event","Alrighty, well today marks the end of the first full week of school...it was pretty chill.  My math class is sweet...we have a British professor who sometimes ends a problem by saying ""And your uncle's name is Bob.""  It's sweet too, because Allegra is in the class, too...yayyyyyyyyyy!  Anyways, and then I feel like I've already talked about this, so I'm gonna move on...Monday night Legs, Tali, Erik, and I went to sushi which was fun slash cheap...oh yeah, Erik paid for us!  It was soooo nice!  And then we went to Java Jones and it was tasty then came back to the house and chilled and what not...then Erik ended up going home at 1:30.  Then Tuesday was school and I went into work because they needed me...then Wednesday was school and work and then Legs, Erik, Dane, Tali, Josh, Ben, Yvette, and I went to sushi again and it was nice...kinda crappy because there were eight of us at the bar, so the interaction was limited, but whatevs...then we came back and hung out...yesterday was school all day...hanging out with Rachel and Tanna in between, and then grocery shopping...Tali picked me up because the bus never came because I looked at the wrong schedule or something...then he hung out for a while.  At 1:40 Erik called to see if I would go drink with him, David, and Ricky, but I was responsible and said no because of school and work...then today was chill...I worked board a couple of times and it was kinda shiesty because Jenna was TRYING to snow me and I was like, seriously, though, why you gotta go and be like that.  Whatevs...especially after Beni was my cook because he was so patient and understanding and what not.  ANYways, I'm rushing because I have to see if I'm gonna go home for the night, but it's looking like no because no one's really picking up, but I kinda want to because it's a free ride for a night, but then I might chill with Erica and Ryan, but who really knows.  So we'll just have to see...ANYways, I'm gonna peace out..hopefully I'll update again soon...I've just not really thought about it, you know?  But yeah, talk to ya later!"

"event","Alrighty, so this past week was the first week of school...eek!  It wasn't TOO bad, but I can tell that it's NOT going to be fun!  But let's be serious, school never is fun, but tevs, mang, it's what you gotta do, you know?  Thursdays are my worst days, because I have five classes; Tuesdays I have three, and Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I have one...then I have Tuesday and Thursday off work, which will help with homework time and what not, in addition to Tuesdays and Thursdays when I have my breaks, but then I'm gonna try to sign up for CLAS for math help, because I'm sure that I'll be needing it.  But yeah, that's basically it...I'm kinda sad that Dane only has one week left at work, but whatevs...and I close tonight, so THAT should be interesting...hopefully they won't keep me the whole time, but then again, what else am I really going to do?  Because, too, it's like I can't buy my books right now because I'm kinda poor (shocking, I know), but I mean, I'm gonna try really hard to save money, which shouldn't be as hard being back in school because it's not like I'm going to have much time to spend money, you know?  Which is good, so I can save money for birthdays and Christmas.  And I mean, of course, I'm gonna spend money on books, bills, groceries, movies, booze, and other going out stuff (and gas when I HAVE THE VAN FOR THREE WEEKS!!!), but it won't go as quickly as when it was summer time, you know?  ANYways, we'll just have to see how my saving goes...plus, too, I really want to lose weight, so I have to buckle down on that hardcore status.  But yeah, I'm just chillin' with Marisa right now until I work at five, so we'll see how that goes...Talk to ya later!"

"event","Okay, so right now, I'm all ready to go to bed and I'm just winding down totally.  I was supposed to close tonight, but ended up getting off a little before 11:30...I think it was around 11:15, which was freaking amazing, because I totally wanted to go home because Legs, Tanna, Dane, and Tali were smoking hookah and just chilling and I REALLY wanted to go home because Dane was there, and we all know how that goes...anyways, so then I ended up getting sent home because I was the sixth person there for closing (which Ricky said he does because he's lazy and likes lots of people to close), but I think it's best that I went home...so today I got up, hung out with the girls of 4844 (our house address) and then Mar and I ended up going to the grocery...we went to Trader Joe's, then Albertsons, then Quiznos so she could get lunch and then Blenders so I could get lunch and it was a fun little outing...I really love our house (both meaning the actual phsyical house and us girls that make it up)!  Then we watched TV and just chilled and what not, and then I had a long conversation with Michael about our birthdays and Halloween and just stuff in general and what not and it was really nice and kind of opened the door of opportunity for me...I don't know, it's hard to explain.  So then David came over, we watched ""CKY"" and then drank some and then went to work...I'm not gonna lie I had a pretty good buzz going (I was kinda bummed when Dane got off early and Drew was crossed off the lineup, but whatevs) and my first ten was kinda shady, but whatevs...and Josh was there which was A-mazing...and of course Tanna and Legs were there, but Legs went home and we only saw each other in transition, but it happens.  So then work work work blah blah blah.  Then this guy Joe was supposed to come over because he basically invited himself slash asked Marisa what she was cooking him for dinner and he cancelled half an hour before he was supposed to be there which bothered me because she was all nervous and put a lot of thought and kind of a lot of money and what not and that kinda made me sad for her and all.  ANYways, so when I was leaving work Josh was all, you suck, blah blah blah for leaving and what not.  I went home and they were smoking hookah and then I tried it and I LOVE hookah!!!  (Can I get a smedium hootkah?)  Then I showered and Josh called me on his last ten and was all ""We're not talking.""  And I was all, so thanks for calling me to tell me that...so, then why did you call me?  And he was all, good question, I don't know...I seriously love him, he's so adorable!!!  I was sooo stoked to see him last night at Freebirds and I got to meet Marcus and everything, which was awesome!  ANYways, so then Tanna, Legs, and I went to go pick up Mark after Tali and Dane left and then we came back, Legs went to bed and then mom, dad, and I smoked hookah some more and then David came over with his friend Allen for a little bit, picked up his clothes (that sounded slooter status), and then vodka and then went home and then I came into here to go to sleep slash unwind and now I'm going to go to sleep...I have the day off tomorrow and so does Tanna...Mar has her interview at 10 but after that it's pretty much just chill status slash get ready for our party, which I'm not really expecting a big turnout, just a few more people than we normally have over, you know?  ANYways, Michael dropped thte idea of coming up which would be FABULOUS, but he has a lot of homework and what not, but part of me still hopes that he comes up, but let's be serious, when do I not want my friends to be here?  But yeah, I can't wait to have the van for November!!!  It's going to be wonderful and soooo nice and I'm gonna go driving around and in the mountains (which I've been wanting to do since freshman year) and what not...it's gonna be so nice to have that freedom.  But yeah, I'm gonna go to sleep now and drink green tea in the morning to try to rejuvenate my voice and throat, because it's most definitely time...but yeah, sleep well, world and I'll conquer you later today (who says that, by the way?  I hate my life...no, I don't, actually and it's really freaking nice to feel like that)!  Good night!
Post script, I'm in love with this song and have been for a little while and I'm not really sure why, but whatevs, I keep listening to it over and over and over and over and over...I'm just kidding.  No, but really though...love it!"

"event","Alrighty so here we go, a little time for a little update.
So the last time I wanted to update was after the week of Babs and Pretty which was A-mazing...I got to see everyone from home basically (Spoons, Michael, Honey, Babs, Sonia, John, and more, as you're aware) and it was just a seriously great week!  And I was just recently home for Babak's birthday which was again freaking amazing!  Sean and his then boy toy Mark came up to SB Tuesday night slash early Wednesday morning, we went to INO and then I worked during the day on Wednesday, the two of them, Mark's friend Tracy, Marney and I ate dinner at Pascucci, and then we kicked it and then Mark was shady brady and came back twenty years later and then we left to go home.  We picked up Sean's car at Mark's and then he took me to Denny's where Santos picked me up.  Then he and I went to Wal-Mart and screwed around and what not and then went back to his house, watched ""Mean Girls"" and chilled and then went to bed then got up and went to Starbucks and then IHOP (where he gave me his Razr) and then to Target where I got Babak's Turbo Edition of Cranium or whatevs and then Jessica and Justin's new CDs (which I love)!  Then he took me home after getting himself ready (it was funny slash entertaining) and I got gas in the van, picked up flowers and Del Taco and what not for Nikky and then went over to her house to hang out with her and Andrew and then Tollhouse, Sarah, and I went to sushi for dinner and then she took me to Babak's where Michael, Nikky, John, Erik, Caitlin L., Theresia, and I played Cranium and had fabulous ice cream cake and just spent time together to celebrate Babak's birthday and then everyone but Nikky went to Denny's (because that was the first time she had been out for 9243056850 years because of her injury) and then went home.  So then Friday Michael and I went to the high school and visited Elder and Rodriguez and then picked up Babak, went to McDonald's, got manicures, and then they both went home.  Then I went to GCC because I promised Nikky's mom I would and then JC walked in, looked shocked, pointed at me and said something like ""you,"" and then came and gave me a hug and kept coming in to talk to me and what not.  So then I went to Legends with Tollhouse and Co. and then went home, got ready, and then Nikky picked me up and we went to Babs's for his party.  It was really nice!  It was us, Michael, Sonia, John, Caitlin L., Jenel, Matt, Kris, Matt Clear, Santos, Sean, Fletcher, Irving, Erik, and lots more people (like Ashley Morey, Michelle Tran, Ramsey, Jessica, Corey Q., and more)!!!  It was a lot of fun and just really nice having everyone home (oh yeah, Steve and Jeff were there with Brian, Melissa and Lefler came, too)!!!  Then I went home with Sonia and stayed with her that night.  Then she, Michael, Santos, and I went to Denny's for breakfast and then I went back home with la familia de Diaz despues de comer and just hung out: then Nikky came over and we just watched TV and then ate and what not (I took Michael's car and he payed for Little Caesar's where when I was leaving a hott black guy opened the door for me and I was like hollllllerrrrrrrr) and then ended up renting ""Just My Luck,"" and I pretty much passed out (which was weird 'cuz we played Naps during the day, but whatevs) and then Honey took  me home and I packed and what not.  Then I went to Michael's in the morning, Nikky picked me up, and then we ended up going to Coco's where Nikky bought lunch (that was so nice...two free meals two days in a row was such a pleasant and kind surprise) and we just had a good time together!  Sarah took me to Union Station and then my train left at 7:00...got in around 9:30 and then Legs picked me up, we went to Vons, and then I unpacked and then went to work to hang out with Ricky and what not...spent a while there and then the next day Tanna and I walked together to work...afterwards, David, Tali, Ricky, and Erik came over and them, plus the four of us girls just chilled and played drinking games and what not and it was just pleasant hanging out with people.  Then today Legs and I walked to work and it was fun 'cuz it was us, Dane, Tali, Brian, Kim, and a few other fun people...it was Anabel's birthday and I didn't even find out until the end of the day!  ANYways, and then came home and Legs and I were freaking tired as balls.
So that brings us pretty much up to speed from the past few days or whatevs...and can I please just say that I am soooo happy with life right now?!  Of course, there are a few things with room for improvement:  I wish that Nikky was totally healthy and I can stick to a freaking diet plan and we didn't have to go to school and I had a car and it wasn't so far between all of the people back home sometimes (because my gosh I love them all soooo much), and I'm terrified about school and all, but honestly, I am in such a great place right now it is amazing and I feel so corny because I always seem to realize it and I'm like, gosh damn, I'm so lucky and grateful.  And I know that there are rough patches to come, but right now it's so wonderful living the life I live: our new house is beautiful, everyone loves it, my roommate and other two housemates are the best: we just have a great time hanging out together and what not and it's great.  The weather has been amazing lately and I'm seriously just so grateful to have the friends that I do!  I seriously recognize it all the time and I just want to say how I feel all the time, but people up here are only beginning to know who I am; of course they know more than they did when I first moved up here, obviously, but it's so weird when I go home and people know EVERYTHING about me, about the mood I'm in based on how I'm acting and everything else, but like people up here are starting to really know who I am and the fact that they still accept me baffles my mind because they're learning about how I am for real deep down and what not and it's so interesting to watch them still want to be friends with me and all, you know?  It's been so nice and I wish that people knew how much I care about them and am appreciative of them and the time we spend together and all...it's so corny, but true and I just wish everyone could know how much I do care and how I will be there for them and all, you know?  Anyways, I think I'm gonna finish watching ""Will and Grace"" (the second of two episodes and I LOVE it)!!! But yeah, tomorrow I have work 11:15-5:00 and I'll see if I can work a mid or whatevs, but we'll just have to see...have a great night!  (PS is it wrong that I'm semi-skeptical of the future because things are going so well right now?  *Knock on wood*)  Good night!"

"event","Okay, so basically, the other day I filled the entire typey boxy thingie with a recap of the wonderful ""Week of Babs and Pretty"" (the week slash two that I was home for the summer) and then it got erased so I got bitter and we were leaving anyways, so I might go back later and try to recap, but no promises...basically, that week was A-FUCKING-MAZING...okay, as long as we're clear.  While I was reading Babs's journal today, I was like, aww, that would be so nice to be able to look back in a few weeks, days, or in his case, years to see what I did or whatevs, so at least for now I'm gonna try to do that.  Well, today, I went to work late because Tanna and I went to an open house (where the old lady didn't even give us the time of day, probably because we're kids), then we went to leave and I was probably going to be to work by 12 (I started at 11:30), but then Tanna locked her keys in her car!  And she normally leaves the back unlocked, but not this time (okay, like the only time), so then called AAA and her membership expired in April so she had to renew it, but then they ended up coming probably within like 15 minutes or whatevs, which was frickin' sweet.  Got to work around 12:15 and it was chill...Luz was all, I'm sorry about yesterday, my darling (basically some lady yelled at me, said I was too loud, called me a loud whore, blah blah blah, made me cry and I had to leave the stand) and I was like, no whatever.  She then told me how she was telling that lady that she was rude and what not, whatevs, then Kegan was like, no, you don't understand...when that happened and you left, we all just stared at her and were like, dude, no one messes with our Mel...and then Josh was like, yeah, pretty much I'll beat up anyone.  It was soooo cute!!!  And yesterday when Spoons called he was like, what's wrong, you seem depressed and I told him what happened (when I came back up to the stand, I was shaking so violently that my manager had to hold my hand for 3.74 to make it stop) he was like, I hate her, what's her name, I'm gonna shoot her...it was just super nice to see how everyone was all defending me and made me feel really loved.  ANYways, so back to today, so then we were all just workin' and what not...then I went on my break at 4 so Tanna, Legs, and I could go look at another house...cute as balls!!!  We pretty much fell in love!!!  So then I came back...Dane, Drew, Ricky, and Tali came on which made me very happy!  Then Dane was all, dude Mel, I just got your message today and I was like, it's been forever since I've seen you...he was like, no really, I'm aware...it's been exactly a week since we got off work and went to that party (the wang in my mang night where he saved me).  He was like, remember how I was hesitant to go out because of my grandma and I was all, yeah, and he said, well, this morning...and then just looked at me-his grandma passed away!!!  It was soooo sad.  Kept working, whatevs, got sent outside...came in a little after eight and then clocked out...Tanna was NOT happy with the new cook Steph.  So now I'm going to get ready and Jenna and Josh are coming over and we're gonna go out or whatevs.  But yeah, that's pretty much what happened...we'll see how tonight goes...hope it's a good night (I'm sure it will be, though)...Until the next time! =)"

"event","So basically, life is going pretty freaking well as usual.  Yesterday was fourth of July and it was pretty legit considering we thought we had to work from 5-11...our manager Ricky let us off before seven because we were SOOO freaking slow!  ANYways, earlier, Tanna and I met Allegra and Amy at the beach and it was chill...then Tanna and I went and got some booze so we could have some with us so we could start around nine and be buzzin' by the time we got off work.  Nice surprise not having to stay at work (and to see Dane there because Legs and I thought he had the day off).  So then we come home and then Allera, Nicole, their friend Laura, Rachel, Erica, Shanna, and Nick came over (later Sarah Demchuck, her friend Courtney, and Jennifer Ho came over...little weird, but whatevs...they wanted to play Shots a lot, so naturally I did and naturally I blacked out) and our new black friend Tim Brown...it was nice especially since I hadn't seen Nick FOREVER!!!  ANYways, so then it was just chill and we played some beer pong in our house (yes, I know, how, one might ask, but we figured it out as always) and I just got belligerent (sad times, I know...I really think there's something wrong with my memory guy or something but tevs mang) and then woke up this morning in the living room (hey, my bed was acting as the couch, okay...oh yeah, we just got Tanna's in today!)...whatevs, it's all good in the hood.  And then today I spent from 9:30 until 4 at school...I was reading slash researching in the library after my classes.  And then Tanna, Nick, Matt, and I went to Freebirds for dinner because Pepe's was closed and it was a fun little dinner fest (it was kinda like brothers and sisters unite, you know?) and then Tanna and I moved our living room 5648093260 times.  I got to talk to Sonia and Michael which was nice as always (I'm getting kinda into an ""I miss my homies"" phase, but it's okay) and I even got to talk to my Honey today.  I miss Spoons like balls and just hope that he's making it through this totally  busy time and what not.  But yeah...I really miss the kids from home, but I'm still having fun up here, but you know?  And summer school is already practically 1/3 of the way done...midterms start next week I think!  I can't wait until all we have to do is work...it's kinda sad because Allegra's leaving for Seattle for two weeks on Sunday so that's gonna be sad and Marney's in Spain...like I know they're going to be slash are having a great time, but it's like, aww....and then Legs and I still need to find a place to live next year (okay, I'll try to work on it tomorrow) and I'm sad that Nick's gonna be moving away from me...no more double NN!!!  AND Tanna's not gonna be in IV, but she's like two feet away!  AND I got excited for Michael and my 21st birthday and Vegas and what not and I wanna go to Texas or New York or Utah or something like that relatively soon, but we'll see...you know?  I wanna get a new wardrobe, too (and take care of my credit card debt)...but yeah, I'm just rambling, but I'm gonna shower and then go to sleep...night! =)"

"event","So here's what's up right about now...school is in its tenth week and that's good and yet bad...there's so much going on right now!  Welllllll, first of all, I'm a little overwhelmed because I still have a few more classes and then papers and finals...thankfully, I only have two final papers and two final exams, so that's not too bad, but considering how I suck at taking tests and one paper is a four to five page Spanish paper that entails doing research and the other is a now 10-12 page Writing paper (initially 15, thank goodness) I'm kinda stressin', but when do I not when it comes to school, you know?  It's all good, though, even though I'm getting really nervous about the whole school thing...I mean, I'm coming up to completing my second year and I'm scared shitless about finding a major I can actually do well in that's interesting...it's all good, though, we'll just have to see what comes up, since it all works out in the end.  And then I have summer school, but it won't be too bad because Tanna's living with me this summer and we pretty much planned out our schedules (more or less, roughly)...we're gonna go to class, go to the beach, go to work, go to sleep (okay, we might party a little), get up and do homework then start it all over again!  It's gonna be freaking intensely fun!  It's kinda crappy that Legs has summer session b, but we'll make it work!  And THEN I'm super stoked to go home in a couple of weeks because I miss Glendora and all my Glendorans, you know?  It's like gosh damn, I haven't been there since Sonia's baby shower back in the end of March!!!  That's freaking crazy!!!  AND I'm gonna have a car so I can drive around all of my friends who always drive my sorry ass everywhere!!!  Hello nice and freedom here I come!  By the way, I freaking love my life and am so fortunate to have everyone in it that I have...Honey, Michael, Spoons, Caitlin, Tanna, Legs, Marn, Jaime, Mike, Melissa, Lefler, Sonia, Nick, and everyone else...I'm seriously sooooooooo lucky and blessed to have everyone that I have and while we might not be able to talk all the time or see each other as often as we would like, we're always just a phone call away and I'm so thankful for that!  Plus, I love my work (even though our head manager guy sucks balls, but whatever)...I've made some really fun friends there (that's what brought Tanna and me together) that I have sooo much fun with!!!  I know that I'm all kinds of busy with school and what not right now, but it's all part of life so I'm working on just taking it all as it comes and I think I've come a long way from just where I was a year ago today...granted around this time I was having lots of revelations, but I have changed so much over this past year and I think they're changes for the best.  I should get back to reading slash writing and studying, but I just wanted to post a little update (hey, for me, this is a pretty little update)...Okay, good talk...yay for life and fantabulous people!!!"

"event","So finally I got my livejournal back up and running...here's what happened...I totally forgot my password and kept trying to get it changed, but it went straight to my junk mail, so I was always confused and never got the new one.  ANYways, now I'm back and ready for more...I doubt I'll write in here a lot, but it's nice to have every once in a while, you know?  I'm pretty sure that it won't be read a lot like Babs's, Honey's, or Theresia's (along with everyone else and their mother), but you know, it's kinda fun...plus I'm not an anonymous commenter!  But yeah, so I have about two weeks or so of school left, but this weekend, I'm going to Rosa-fucking-dito and I'm freaking stoked!  It's going to be amazing because it's me and three other girls (from work...Allegra, Tanna, and Jenna) and it's going to be sooo much fun.  We're leaving right after Legs and I are done with our Comm discussion and then we're gonna drink margaritas (I'm gonna try banana) and freaking lay out by the pool all day and then go out at night...we're soooo excited...Jenna and I were driving home today and I was like, ""it's like we're little kids waiting to go to Disneyland.""  And she was all, ""yeah, Friday is Disneyland!""  It's going to be soooooo out of line!  I cannot wait.  ANYways, I really should be going to bed right now so I'm going to take a fast shower and then peace out...I freaking love my life...I have to admit, though, I kinda miss Glendora (not a lot baby boy/girl...just a little bit ;) ) and Honey and Sonia and Michael and Babs and Theresia and John and other people, you know?  So I hope that I get to see them this weekend...I think I'm going to go home the weekend after finals, just for a little break, but we'll see, you know?  AND I want a beach cruiser soooo badly, but I'm gonna hold off on purchasing one at least for a while since it'd be an impulse buy right now and I can wait until I can kind of afford it a little bit more.  AND get this...Spoons comes home in FIVE DAYSSSSS.  I'm sooo excited and I cannot wait until he comes up here...I get to introduce him to people and show him around and just have a bunch of fun with him!  Okay, but yeah, I really need to go because I'm freaking tired as balls and know I'm going to be dead tomorrow and have so much shit to do before the weekend slash before the week is over!  It's all good, though.  But yeah, I'm gonna shower and then pass out!  Night!"

"event","So basically, this is my first entry and Nikky, you were right...it was easy as balls to set up this thing.  ANYways, I just wanted to write a little something...I'm like wondering...when do I write in here?  It would be sad to write more than one thing a day, but right now I kind of feel like that will happen, but will soon subside.  And then, it's like, how long will I keep up with writing everyday?  I don't know...overanalysis of the live journal has begun!  I hate my life!  Do you know that one of my coworkers thought I really was depressed and was concerned?!  I felt soooo badly.  I was like, nooooooo...it's just an expression...I guess it is kind of bad when you think about it, but when you think about a lot of things that we say, they're pretty fucked up, but that's why we don't actually think about it, because then we wouldn't even consider saying half the things we do.  Oh man, I'm rambling.  ANYways, I'm gonna go shopping for some Chritmas presents right now with Alanna...after I get dressed.  Hey, Nikky, I could see this as being a good thing after all...I don't know, we'll see.  Anyways, I hope you all have a great day and I'll talk to you later! =)"

She went so fast.. I thought my face was going to fly off!! I loved it! Then on Wedneday night Jen slept over my house. We tried to sit through Alone in the Dark, but it sucked. Then Thursday I went to the mall. I got my summer reading books. And this pretty sweet top from Pac Sun. I love it I can't wait to wear it! Yay for shopping! so yeah I guess that's all I'm willing to mention."

"event","<p>I never wanted to be an engineer.<br />Or maybe, I just didn&#39;t know what engineers did.<br />In particular what my dad did. At work.<br /><br />What my dad did, was to build the tables, the chairs, the chunky but sturdy furniture in our house. In our old house.<br />He fixed lightbulbs. He repaired clocks. He did wonders with devices.&nbsp;<br />He sanded, filed, drilled, varnished.<br />He made crude wonders out of materials HDB dwellers do not use on a regular basis. (unless they work on wood factories.)<br /><br />I wanted to be like that. Useful and creating items that I could touch and feel and be proud of. (the thing about building gundams is a joke. but i did want to build...)<br /><br />Perhaps that is why I immerse myself in fiction, in creating characters, in drawing. I sink into magazines with colourful furniture, or drink in the fantasies that etsy provides and think<br /><br /><i>&quot;What if I were to create this? What if I were to arrange furniture like that? What is I could design a pattern, a picture, an essay, that would fascinate at least one person who saw it?&quot;</i><br /><br />Self doubt, pragmatism. They are the painful dream -snatching armour that I wore as I aged.<br />Would a job at an oil and energy systems completion tools shit thingamajig satisfy me? No. I&#39;d see the pipe, the safety valve. I&#39;d think, the clients will be happy. I will get paid. A project is complete and I feel satisfaction. But oil is being extracted. Research and development into the field of solar power progresses and I watch at the sidelines. Beautiful art pieces are created, documented, exhibited.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;No one reads this blog, so my narcissism here is deeply indulgent. My narcissism and my huge layer of negative self esteem.<br /><br />There is no beauty in a piece of scrap unless you&#39;ve shaped it yourself.</p>"

Before watching Crazy stupid love (surprisingly good for a love comedy), Me and B and Blackninjastar *snort* moped around the mall, looking for things to do.

B had to buy a baby shower gift for his friend's 1 year old kid's birthday. Somehow the many maternity stores that once lined the 3rd floor seemed to have disappear, save mothercare.

In we mulched.

To find the most adorable squeeworthy toys with ugly price tags!
i mean, there was this bunny that I saw both in the old place my sis used to work at, as well as at Harrod's. Even fluffier, but I digress.

There was a soft Miffy plush (S$35 wtf) and then zebras and doggies and moomoos, starting at S$17.50 for each.

We took a gander at the other baby products, like silicon bibs, cornware feeding bowls, A FREAKING BLUE BIKE FOR TODDLERS!!!

Babies these days have more style than me as a 22 year old aging auntie.

B got the doggy and he's adorable (the dog), but none as cute as Rufus!

And then this will not become a sketch dump, but a heartfelt blog.
<i>
who am I kidding about heartfelt?</i>

<lj-cut text=""click this link to read more noobies"">

So how's life like in Germany?
Starting from the very basics, toilet paper is good and cheap. 2 euros for 10 rolls of 3 ply toilet paper is great. My friend sets aside one roll specially for the kitchen.

The kitchen! My little experimental lab of joy. I cook it, I eat it, and I don't feel overly conscious if the food was good or not. And I suspect it helps my creativity, by thinking up new dishes with my limited ingredient list.

Poor student and all.

Weekend trips were great before, but now that workload and projects are creeping up on me, I suspect very soon I will be flailing like a morning star in a halfling's hands -- for the non literate, that means I am limp as a banana peel.

I really hope that the demands for studying do not take opportunities away from me though. Opportunities to watch the woman's world cup (as uninteresting as that sounds), visiting cities outside Germany.... so on. There are so many, but so little time! 

And then, my feelings about this? About staying away for 5 months?
Thank you technology, for keeping me connected, no matter how irreal the connection is. (for lack of a better word, irreal will suffice, yes?) 
And when one gets lonely, one starts becoming attached to a flower. A flower that was given free, and that has blossomed and brought joy and now will bring sadness for its quick departure.

At night I hug Rufus and Penpen, hoping they won't fall off the bed onto the cold and dusty floor. The pillow is floppy and it gives neck cramps.

I am glad I came however. For a multitude of reasons that I can't really pen down all at once. Maybe in another post, another time.

Had the most entertaining non-familial xmas party yesterday at B-san's house with a harrowing dabbling into Monopoly Deal and abusing my Wii.

I would love to list down some eventful things that happened this year, but my memory fails me by quite a bit.

Perhaps I should start with the overseas trips?

Japan! With 3 gal pals. Dangerous, exhausting, and I was being a total nag queen on the trip. I sincerely apologise to my trip mates, but it was also an awesome adventure.

KL! With B-san's friends and their loyal partners. Stayed in a dinghy and dodgy hotel but otherwise made it through happy and well fed.

Cambodia! A real eye opener since many countries I've been to have well developed housing for the locals. Here beggars and urchins are common sights, but the people are nice and the sights beautiful.

<u>Projects I did this year</u> (sort of)

Prosthetic Sports Knee project! Had some cool group mates both in US and in NUS. Really learned something outside the syllabus and interacted with people i wouldn't usually speak to. And if it weren't for the fact that I will be going for SEP, I would love to carry on the project...

Linoleum and Rubber carving! Did a tiger carving earlier during CNY, and later did rubber stamping. It's fun shit.

Initiated the MangaArtClass! and didn't carry it through cos I was a lazy bitch. Luckily Claude and the new events head pulled it off and it's now open to participants~~~

Sewed my own effing cosplay! Without help from Mummy or grandma! And survived a photoshoot with Eveline! Photoshoots are fun and scary at the same time.

Drew on T-shirts! For xmas present! Which I feel didn't really match up to the returning present I received :( But the t-shirt drawing was fun.... 

Took up a job doing some basic coding! Helped in applying what I;ve learnt in CS1101. And gave me enough moolah to buy the PS3 joy~~~

My love for stationery is bordering on unhealthy now....

Recently went to sing karaoke with some friends. Although now I suspect I go to karaoke shops not to sing, but to hear others sing. I love hearing the raw sounds that come out from people's mouths, turning into tunes that you thought that person could never achieve.
The Pontian noodles after that session was the best pontian noodles I've eaten.

When troubled, slowly examine your feelings. Pick them out one by one and differentiate them.
Some people do better if they express cathartic emotions. ie cry; vent at a wall.
If it is impossible to sound out your concerns, detach yourself from it. 
Let go.
Exercise, be objective.
Running away from the problem by drinking will make matters worse. Find a counsellor if necessary. Sometimes friends are not good enough.

Do other things you are good at to improve self esteem.
Aim reasonably, do not try to overachieve.

Do one's best not to hurt yourself or others!

Accept yourself for who you are. Recognise your good characteristics.

aaaaand i'm gonna fail my social work module for not being able to give sound advice, V and W.
Hope things get better, though I disapprove of how both of you are going about it."

But i'm too lazy for that. I mean, yes i've been drawing, but i'm too lazy to upload the drawings. 
Fatigue too. 
Fatigue from running around NUSCAS, from expanding effort in a relationship, throwing in utmost interest in the biological sciences, rekindling my perverted liking for biochemistry (it was hatred at first sight in JC though...), from the prospect of hosting 12 germans in vivocity, juggling the time to map my modules, wanting to do well in my modules. from volunteering time into shooing away angry foreigners.

I want to go on holiday, just that i've been on holiday so often, it feels like a chore as well.

I'm tired from thinking about the looming sep.
or maybe it's just all excuses."

"event","The final chapter (well not really) of German Lektion, and I felt as if I had short changed myself.

Where was my profound vocabulary, my prolific language skills, my confidence in blurting out ""Guten Tag, moi Cherie, wie geht's?""
Admittedly that contains French.

It feels as if, in braving through the doldrums of Engineering, my zest for the language and learning new things not related to a boring field has dissipated.

My final paper was a mess.
My oral was a mess.
I was a mess.

Listening to my classmates speaking in the language fluently and expressively, while I struggle to remember words and sentence formations, biting my lip and straining to understand what my lecturer was shooting off about, staring at my paper with no clue on what to do.

Despite having made a list of all the grammar forms the night before and confidently strutting into the final exam room.

Then receiving it with a red, angry, 55% neatly printed on the top right hand corner.

Embarassing myself for not knowing how to write an emergency letter to my course co-ordinator for a reccomendation letter in German.
Despite being a level 4 student.

Somehow somewhere something went somewhat awry.

And I do not know if I will be able to accept and live in German society when the time comes.

My classmates are enthusiastically offering their skills as translators for the YOG.
I was actively hiding away from the opportunity, afraid and ashamed of my lacklustre ability to speak.

I sometimes wonder, if I would have turned out a different person if I was in Arts. Would I be wearing tights and dresses to school everyday? I know I would love to wear a hat as well. A hat and nice looking shorts and maybe even a vest.

Maybe I would be all ""Maths can talk to my hand!"", or maybe I would be wistfully wishing I was smarter in the ""male"" field, the sciences and maths.
I have a feeling I am still wishing I was smarter in the sciences!

Then I would not have met all the friendly and interesting people in Engineering?
Are not the Arts people interesting as well?
Would I appear snobbish to my current friends if I were in Arts, or would I appear to be some societal outcast to the Arts people?

In the last German lecture, we played a game.
It involved listing out names of cities, countries and rivers with a given letter.

And then I stared hopelessly at my paper again.
My friends came up with places I knew but could not put to paper, Frankfurt, Freiburg, Japan! Johannesburg...

Names that I know but could not recall.

I'm not sure now, that I'm heading in the right direction. I hate being useless."

<lj-cut>

first day: it started off sweltering. Made a few khaki peng you and went off to eat yakun even though we already started work.... hadn't eaten french toast for so long!!! so it felt like heaven.

Then what felt even more like heaven was the feeling of giving out balloons. The feeling of waiting for balloons to be given out sucked.

fast forward blablabla oh no I got stuck in a musty dusty mouldy room packing tote bags. If you thought your tote bag smelt mouldy, you are absolutely correct. There were quite a few where greenish or black fungi was growing on them... had to toss them away :( Also after leaving a pile of them on your lap for too long... your lap felt damp too.

Ended up too tired after dinner and didn't accomplish much work.

second day:
....What. A1 doesn't start until 9am. So some of us got stranded waiting for the bus... finally ordered a cab and paid $1.60 each. not so bad.

then back to packing.
Pack
pack
pack.
Packed for half a day. Signs of madness started to appear. Also massive boycotting by the time lunch arrived.

So in the end I ended up distributing bags again.... so boring.
Halfway through the artist who designed the bag for the first day popped up and asked if ""please, do you still have that design?"" now there were a couple of those bags under the counter but i strongly suspect someone had koped them the previous day and intended on keeping them, so i said, no sorry, we're all out :(

Then another co-worker came over and told her to try get it from the other info counter inside.

I felt so sad for her! her own creation and yet she couldn't hold it in her hands... 
Later found out there was one more huge stash in the store room. 
Guh.


So after work I was so happy I could finally leave the loooong day behind me, i sped off to the bus stop and waited for half an hour god-my-legs-were-killing-me.

Finally bus came, then saw my colleague at the back. When he moved up front he was all ""Heeey where were you. The food stalls were giving out free food""

;____;
wryyyyy I so wanted to try the Chino's and the yogurt thingy. sob.
According to him Chino's is going to try to destroy Starbucks with good quality and competitive pricing. (oh and Chino's may be opening a branch in NUS too! I'm going to support them!)

 Starbucks is so overpriced. I'll gladly pay for a $4 peppermint coffee as compared to a $7.90 one.

ok rant off. No drawings today. wheeeee.

<b><font size=""22"">THE WEATHER IS SO HOT</font></b>

With all the bushfires along CTE/PIE/TPE/ I really have no idea which expressway i saw the brown patches of trees, but damn they were obviously burnt. Just saying, IT'S HOT.
I haven't felt this sticky since sec4. Which was gosh so long ago. 

Back then it was so hot I was forced to tie double ponytails to school. In secondary school that's not normal, but yea. The heat got to many.

Also I was ahem encouraged to update this blog more often, but this is an art blog and i only post when I have some randomshit I drew out ... so here's my random shitzu. The raccoon from the latest Street Fighter commercials.

Also for the random random few who visit my blog and have no inkling how to use photoshop, worry no more! I have done a few mini tutorials to aid my cousin with her photoshop dilemma and maybe they'll be of some use to you:

ok so maybe they're not that useful.</center>"

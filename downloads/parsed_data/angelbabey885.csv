"event","ok so i had a great time last night with kt nate and brian at the musical. i had a great time with nate i love him soooo much! i just hope next weekend that we can go to someone's house instead of being in a public place. then kt and brian had rough sex in the bleachers so now shes all bruised...yeah its true. haha. then kt came home with me and spent the night we watched SAW which was freaking wierd as hell. and in the morning i was reallyyyy hyper after she woke me up by jumping on me at about 9 in the morning, yeah it was freaking great waking up to that. i swear to god shes the devil or something, i had a dream that she got up and was just staring at me from where my computer is..shes really scary. so then we ran around ate and then she had to get dressed to leave around 2. that was the end of my good time becauase then i hear one of my best friends decides to call me a bitch because i didnt call her about last night when i did but shes a dumbass and blames me when her phone is busy and i cant get a hold of her any other way because she doesnt have a cell phone and she is acting like its all my fault and thats just something i dont have to deal with, even though she didnt call me last weekend telling me that she wasnt coming over and then calling me later and telling me that lizzie and her made plans early when really the probably didnt because she never said anything about that and then she cries about stupid guys yelling at her which it really doesnt matter but ok cool, they dont matter. but whatever i dont even care. i have kt. lol. i just think ppl who are assholes should all be shot. yeah i probably fall into that catergory sometimes but seriously ppl shut the fuck up, you arent cool so dont pretend.

"event","Hello again, it is Katherine Lynn Maria Vieth. Well, Lauren Marie Ann Kirry and I were just musing about how good looking gentlemen distract us while we were driving. And then I was saying that she needs to find me a man. Because, well, you know, going to an all girls school, theres not too much oppurtunity for that. So she said do you just want to put an ad up in my LiveJournal, and I said sure. And she said yeah I hate the people who read it anyway, so I don't care. But don't worry, I love you all, so its ok. 

First off, I am looking for a polite gentlemen who holds doors open and such. He must be taller than me, and I am only 5'4, but still, some boys haven't hit that point yet. Um, blonde or brown hair, either is fine. Long curly hair I think is sexy, but whatever floats your boat. And he has to weigh more than me, so that means no little shrimpo boys, por favor. And you know, personality I guess somewhat counts. Funny, nice, knows how to have fun, isn't nervous. All that stuff.

Now, it's not that I'm desperate here.. yet.... and it's not that I'm ugly, I'm average, not ugly. But you know, people say they like me, but I have high standards to match. Not every guy can have this booty, and trust me, its a nice one. So si, I am taking your calls, so hit me up before I die of boylossness :.D

"event","Hello everyone, this is Miss Katherine Lynn Maria Vieth-o. I am Lauren Marie Ann Kirry's favorite topic of discussion. If you could not guess by my name, I am THE KT Lynn! WOOHOO! So I'm sitting here talking on the phone-izzle with Lauren-izzle about that Terri Schiavo, one of our favorite topics of government discussion and I say ""Hm, Lauren, you need to update your journal"" and she says ""NO I HATE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO READ IT ANYWAY!"" and I say ""GASP! LAUREN!"" and she says ""So what?"" So I go into her house, using my TEMPORARY LICENSE, aren't I cool? and I get her password and now I am going to update for her. Well um, Lauren, myself, and Mr. Benjamin Spotts, yes, THE Ben Spotts, went putt-putting Tuesday. Oh yes, and Saturday night we went to the movies with THE Joseph Scheidenberger and Eamon El-Sawaf, and that was grand. Personally I do not know what else Lauren Marie Ann Kirry has done since. I do know she went to 11:30 Mass on Easter Sunday, and I went to 8:00. Which sucked. Oh yes, and she got her temporary license on Tuesday. And she's already on the highway. Siigh, my little girl is growing up oh so fast. I remember back in the 4th grade, when we first became best friends. Siiigh, those were the days. Now, I am afraid to say, she is a skank... but so am I, so it's ok. Something great about Lauren though... she loves to laugh at my problems. I happen to be having a very serious mental breakdown, and I entrust her to my secretive secrets, and she laughs.. SHE LAAAAUGHS! Siiigh, bitch. So yeah, I guess I'll go. We've moved on from our government discussion to talking about George Bush shooting assasins and how I seem to be super horny. Yes, thats right, I am. Just kidding. Maybe. For Lauren I'm always horny. Ok I'm sorry you've all wasted your time reading this. Goodnight.

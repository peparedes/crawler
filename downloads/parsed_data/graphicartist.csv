"event","Life is overwhelming!! Somethimes I think I have bitten off more than I can chew with everythign that I do. IT is so hard for me to be working 50 hours a week and go to school full time, and still be able to get my projects done in time. I seriously have very little free time. Most of my free time is spent doing homework of some sort. It is very frustrating.

As of right now I have tuesday and wednesday off for this week that we are in but I have to have this project done by THursday (or half way done). I really want to switch my shift so I can go out for Julies bday on Thursday night but I am afraid if I do that I wont have any time to do the project. So it looks like I will have to wait until I get what I need to completed before I can ask someone to switch me. Again very frustrating."

"event","Julie, I Must say your words inspired me to create my own account as a way to get my feelings out there as well as communicating with you and Vanessa. Two of the boyscouts that I talk to the least.

I have been so bogged down with everything lately, between school, moving and working. It can get very overwhelming. I have to say that I am not thrilled to be living at home but at least it is a way to save some money I hope. It is also nice to live with people that you can respect as well as like.

I like being busy because it is a way to avoid everything that goes on in my head. If I am too busy I don't have the time to dwell on the things that bother me. I am certain that this is not a good way to look at it but it will have to do for now. I will dwell on the things that run through my head in my next journal. But for now I have to get back to that dreaded home work. Blah!!"

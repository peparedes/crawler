I got several offers by now and I'm *so* excited and very pleased with the outcome. In addition to those from the earlier entry, I got 11 new inquiries/
offers from overseas {Europe, Australia, 1 Mideast}. 5 of which I am seriously considering. Some very well-known, large companies with great positions and benefits. Ha! Lots of local and national US-companies as well but errrr, well, not the focus any longer. I can now say I've been there & done that.

"event","So for lack of foreign accent, it is generally assumed that I am American in the sense that I was born here. With that assumption come a number of other assumptions based on my looks, or as they would probably put it here, ""racial features"". In actuality, I just happen to live here. For the time being. To me this is just O-N-E of the many countries in the world. And it takes itself *way* to serious. I can neither identify with the race obsession nor did I ever even think in these terms prior to experiencing ""the American way"" right here on location. What it is is that *AMERICA MAKES YOU* look at this through the national eye. You are forced to check little boxes indicating your race -- on government forms and other questionaires. I do not care what excuse they use, in another country recording information under such categories would be considered severely racist and could never be practiced.

Even in a city like Los Angeles, I have been looked at like an alien for listening to [insert nationalty/race other than your own here] music and watching apparently non-appropriate films that strictly involved characters from backgrounds different than my own. 

IMAGINE THAT! Those strange movies! With those strange people! Why would anyone even want to do that?! Unless they have a [insert race of choice here] fetish of course! What a sad life it must be when you're so severely brain-washed that you can't even do these simple things without having people question your motives and intentions. You are so easily accused of having some sort of fetish! Just because you are actually WORLDLY and don't play the race game.  What a sad, sad world view this is. I have encountered the same with individuals
from all kinds of ethnicities here, obviously because they were all raised in the same society. I *think* what makes us European is that we are more worldly towards all things different by default. But I also know that only those who have experienced both cultures for a *significant* amount of time will ever fully understand what I'm talking about... The alternative is living in a self-created bubble and simply ignoring the state of the nation which is not something I can do.
   
Thank heavens there's a whole world out there. Which, contrary to popular {all-American, flag-waving} belief, it's actually worth exploring! And no, you DO NOT have everything here. (Which btw is the most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life, lol! It was repeated to me again just recently). But: This is not even a rant, just social commentary. *Smile* 

And, there is hope yet. 

Many do have broader horizons -- or have now started exploring outside these borders after the last election brought with it a sort of shift in these regards... I can only hope that the trend will continue. I would bet a lot of  people have no idea that they can go to say, Europe for the price of a ticket from LA to NY... UK is around $350 currently, continental Western Europe starting at around $425. All high season pricing that will drop even lower in Sept/Oct. What I've started considering just recently is the question if people may be *afraid* to go abroad. The thought didn't even occur to me until somebody mentioned something along those lines, stating that many here have a sort of inferiority complex due to lack of knowledge, foreign language skills, provincial upbringing and so on. when I think about it, I do see how this could be, also going by what I've seen in travellers over in Europe and how they behaved. Interesting thought anyway. Can anyone here identify with that to any degree? I'm really just curious.

It was really interesting to read about your experiences. :o) 

I still haven't responded to any of the people from that dating site and will probably just take my profile off and leave it at that. Some of the guys seemed fine but I guess I just feel weird about meeting that way. It seems so forced to me. Meeting in a forum or chat room or on a messenger would still be somewhat

It doesn't interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing. 

It doesn't interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dreams, for the adventure of being alive. 

It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to know if you have touched the centre of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by life's betrayals or have become shriveled and closed from fear of further pain. I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, without moving to hide it or fade it or fix it. 

I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own, if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, to be realistic, to remember the limitations of being human. 

It doesn't interest me if the story you are telling me is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself; if you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul; if you can be faithless and therefore trustworthy. 

I want to know if you can see beauty, even when it's not pretty, every day, and if you can source your own life from its presence. 

I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine, and still stand on the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon,"" Yes!"" 

It doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much money you have. I want to know if you can get up, after the night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done to feed the children. 

It doesn't interest me to know who you know or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the centre of the fire with me and not shrink back. 

It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I want to know what sustains you, from the inside, when all else falls away. 

I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.

Well, that's pretty accurate actually. Short of the 'love' part perhaps. I'm only tough or should I say, the multi-layered, apparently reserved observer and enigma until I've decided the person is 'worthy' to be let into the inner circle. I will never be with someone just for the sake of being with someone. It seems so childish, shallow and opportunistic to just go through 'dates' with 500 people in order to pick one, or something to that effect. I'd feel as if I
placed a 'marriage wanted' ad in the local paper. There goes their dating
concept again, heh. But oh well. ""Andere Laender, andere Sitten"" as they say... 

Now this reminds me of Mansour! He was one of these guys who sold snacks and things at the beach in Tunisia. He literally tried to pick up every single, halfway attractive blonde in sight. More so and more aggressively than the others. I was later told he was something of a local legend and the second time I saw him, years later, he literally looked like his own shadow. It made me wonder if he had caught something as it would be quite possible with the lifestyle he had had but perhaps it was something completely different. I don't think he's still roaming this earth, at least not in the same incarnation. To the above, he would add ""...andere Frauen, andere Titten!"". Funny at first. A North African beach isn't quite the place where you'd expect to hear this kind of thing.
But yuck, on second thought it was just so common and gross, lol. He must have
picked it up from some German-speaking tourists. Most of the guys working in tourism there knew all the important phrases and could have an at least chit-chatty conversation in 5, 6, 7 languages apart from Arabic. Which I found quite impressive. 

French (ex-colony so this is the 2nd language anyway), English, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish usually, in this order of proficiency. Most of the tourists they got were from these countries so they picked it up via daily interaction. I have seen 6 year olds speak all these languages as they were trying to sell you something. Such cute kids there, I always wanted to take a few. I never saw any Americans. Lots of Brits. I'm guessing Germans and Dutch probably were the largest group. I wonder if it has changed since? Doubt it for the Amis. (Who's got the time here, apart from students and Peacecorps folks perhaps.) I'm guessing the eastern europeans and russians must be some of the new groups of tourists in the country as things have changed so much for them in the last decade regarding the opportunity to travel. 

Tunisia is just so pretty a country. More laid back than Morocco. Less busy, less touristy apart from the beach zones. The people are somewhat different as well, not only in looks but in their demeanor, it seems. The south, the coast, the parts the Romans considered their Kornkammer, the wine regions around Cap Bon. Just beautiful, all of these places. Multiple visits still aren't enough. So much left to explore. Love the overland trips, just cruising in a rented jeep. I should head that way again at some point and look up the old friends and lovers. The way things are, I will probably have to get out of here first or else, I'll never have the time to go *properly* and really enjoy in peace. S wants to go again too and so does N.  

Has anyone been recently? What's it like these days?"

"event","Kirsty Ally always reminds me of Frau Haytema. 'Rustikal', outspoken, slightly 'ordinaer' with a temper but oh-so mysteriously womanly and fascinating in this self-proclaimed 'ancient goddess/witchy' way. She had turned into a full-blown feminist aka manhater out of bitterness. I always felt I understood her, even when I was just a child. The observant empath in me did... She would have never known. Always this air of negativity and misery about her too. She must have been very lonely inside. I wonder what's up with her these days. And with Dominique and Isabelle. Dominique was always a doer, a leader, very egotistical but charming, bold, blunt. I used to admire her for all of these qualities. She was a go-getter from the start. Even at 3 years old. So much like her mother even though their relationship was rocky to say the least. Last thing I heard she was studying Psych in Holland in order to then be the director of an orphanage. That was the plan at least.

Isabelle her complete opposite in character. Sweet and pretty, quietly charming girl-next-door type a la Sandra Bullock. Always more on the reserved side but cautiously social and definitely caring and warm-hearted. I can picture her in an occupation that involves social services, such as caretaking of some form in the medical field. Or something creative, marketing/ad agency perhaps.

Something tells me that Mom Dagmar may not even be alive anymore. I'm not sure where that comes from, gut feeling. I have not spoken to or seen any of them in 10 or 15 years. It's most regrettable actually. They were such a big part of my life at one point. And they still linger."

"event","My neighbor is addicted to Diet Coke. And definitely has some form of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. It's getting painful to watch. 

He will leave the house for work, equipped with his Diet Coke, looking hurried and actually quite cute in this mad professor kind of way. He will then go down to his car just to return to the house again -- obviously in order to double check things before finally taking off. The ritual repeats itself every single morning, and in similar ways except vice versa, when he returns in the evening.
When we had a little chat some time ago about some community-related matter, he
seemed very nice but we never spoke again as we generally don't cross paths,
coming and going at different times of the day. I'm not one who is keen on doing the neighborhood gossip/mindless small talk thing with random strangers
just because they may live here and, quite obviously, neither is he. But this is how it tends to go in this city: it's all quite anonymous, people move all the time and all that good stuff. At first I thought he may be from the UK, Scotland in particular because he's got the look I have seen a lot in people
from those parts. Very fair and very tall but with dark, curly hair. Probably around my age or a little older. As it turned out, he is not an alien though.
At least not going by the accent. Which sounded more like eastcoast USA. Watching his rituals makes my therapist self come alive. So now what?"

"event","I'd rather be at the beach but not the local one but some tropical one, far off from the western hemisphere. Again, I am thinking I need a cultural fix. In a place where the aim is not to artificially make everything the same so it can fit the category ""AMERICAN"" but rather to TRULY acknowledge and respect differences for what they are and simply let them be. This subject still fascinates me. Geographical flexibility required, ""forced"" individuality and mixing of ""groups"" for reasons of political correctness making ""sameness"" in other areas necessary?

-----------------------

In other news, I've received a few offers. 2 of them international even though I've only had this part up for 3 days. I should hope this is an indication of what is to come! The first international one I am not that interested in; I'd rather not work in that particular area. 

The other is worth looking into. I've emailed them to acknowledge receipt of
their info and we shall see. As far as domestic goes... I'm going to poke around a bit with those who've called just to see what people are willing to pay nowadays for a superstar like me, hihi. Half the time, interviewers here are quite clueless. Many have no concept of their own body language and just what it may say about them and their errrrrrr...""expertise"". No wonder though, hardly anybody's trained properly... At least not by the standards I'm used to. 

Observation skills. Apart from working skills (which I certainly have) and a big mouth (which I do not have and find annoying but *will* fake if necessary), the most important thing to possess in order to get a good deal still are good old observation skills. Not to be underestimated. So. As there's no actual NEED to change now, I shall give myself another 12-15K raise when asked and see if any of them will bite. Now there's a plan.

London bombings. Unfortunate, yes. Sad and horrible for the people involved, yes. A surprise? Certainly not, and the Londoners seem to agree. There simply is no way to make a city ""safe"". It will *never* be 100% safe, it's just impossible. As terrible as all this is, that is reality. Officially supporting
Shrub's actions as a country -- and I say COUNTRY as government and people aren't necessarily the same thing -- is likely to lead to such events in consequence. It does not make it right. It is merely a matter of logic. I do feel for those who have lost their lives or their health in these bombings. Hopefully these people and their relatives will at least be able to get closure of some kind by actually seeing those arrested who are to blame."

So pretty out. 

And I'm feeling much better today. Last night's ""food session"" ended up being a trip to the grocery store to get the daily basics and eating too much Breyer's Strawberry icecream but that was the extend of it. I've been having the strangest, most interesting dreams of late and have been recording them in the dream journal. Whatever ends up here obviously isn't all there is to me/ life/whatever. 

I am assuming the same is true for just about anyone on LJ... But then, I could be wrong! I have to remind myself that not everyone is so complex. One of my greatest traits and at the same time downfalls is that I am thinking too much. I'm way too analytical sometimes. Make that most of the time... All the time. It's a blessing and a curse for sure."

Gorgeous weather in the Southland. I can't wait to get out of here and go play at the Bell. The trip was nice and we had a good time but I came back with major toothache.

When I still lived in Germany, particles of Sahara sand could be found on window sills and such as these ""sciroccos"" seasonally carried dust all the way north, as far as central Europe. Apparently it is the same with West African winds and the Caribbean (see reference below). I always thought this was an amazing fact.

"event","There are 23 letters in your name.
Those 23 letters total to 104.
There are 10 vowels and 13 consonants in your name.

Your number is: 5
The characteristics of #5 are: 
Expansiveness, visionary, adventure, the constructive use of freedom.

The expression or destiny for #5:
The number 5 Expression endows with the wonderful characteristic of multi-talents and versatility. You can do so many things well. The tone of the number 5 is constructive freedom, and in your drive to attain this freedom, you will likely be the master of adaptability and change. You are good at presenting ideas and knowing how to approach people to get what you want. Naturally, this gives you an edge in any sort of selling game and spells easy success when it comes to working with people in most jobs. Your popularity may lead you toward some form of entertainment or amusement. Whatever you do, you are clever, analytical, and a very quick thinker.

If there is too much of the 5 energy in your makeup, you may express some the negative attitudes of the number. Your restless and impatient attitude may keep you from staying with any project for too long. Sometimes you can be rather erratic and scatter yourself and your energies. You have a hard time keeping regular office hours and maintaining any sort of a routine. You tend to react strongly if you sense that your freedom of speech or action is being impaired or restricted in any way. As clever as you are, you may have a tendency to make the same mistakes over and over again because much of your response is glib reaction rather that thoughtful application. You are in a continuous state of flux brought by constantly changing interests.

Your Soul Urge number is: 8

A Soul Urge number of 8 means: 
With an 8 soul urge, you have a natural flare for big business and the challenges imposed by the commercial world. Power, status and success are very important to you. You have strong urges to supervise, organize and lead. Material desires are also very pronounced. You have good executive abilities, and with these, confidence, energy and ambition. 

Your mind is analytical and judgment sound; you're a good judge of material values and also human character. Self-controlled, you rarely let emotions cloud judgment. You are somewhat of an organizer at heart, and you like to keep those beneath you organized and on a proper track. This is a personality that wants to lead, not follow. You want to be known for your planning ability and solid judgment. 

The negative aspects of the 8 soul urge are the often dominating and exacting attitude. You may have a tendency to be very rigid, sometimes stubborn.

Your Inner Dream number is: 7

An Inner Dream number of 7 means: 
You dream of having the opportunity to read, study, and shut yourself off from worldly distractions. You can see yourself as a teacher, mystic, or ecclesiastic, spending your life in the pursuit of knowledge and learning.

SO SO true, the last paragraph."

"event","So. 
After much running about in all livable parts of coastal Southern California and *still* not finding exactly what I want in new housing, I've decided to sign another 9 months lease right here and give it another go later.

Whatever I saw that was up to my standards and in my driving range at all was $250-600+ more a month, all with deposits of $1000-1800 AND NO ADDED FEATURES OR ADDED LUXURIES TO WHAT I'VE ALREADY GOT RIGHT HERE. 

Now the financial part is one thing but if I'm not even *convinced* of a place, on top of it being significantly more pricey and it not being an improvement otherwise, there's really no point in going anywhere, is there? 

Every single condo and even apartment I looked at that was less pricey than
mine and had the same or more features/space ranged from simply horrid to never
updated to ugly/sloppy-looking to having weird people living all around to
being in questionable neighbourhoods. 
The latter being a major consideration in this city! 

I had already disregarded all the known weirdo neighbourhoods in my search but
as it turns out, these things can change rapidly and even go block by block in
areas where just 3 or 5 years ago, everything looked great. As Dennis put it: 
""The ghetto's creeping west and eats up more and more of what used to be good
places to live"". Apparently he's right. This is mostly about socio-economic
status here nowadays and not necessarily linked to any ""racial"" or heritage
considerations even though the 2 still go hand in hand to some degree. 

Gotta love the USA for making it necessary to even think of such things...

Either way, let's look at the positive side. I got an update on the real estate
situation and next time will have more of an insight as to what the conditions
are and where to go. I also met 2 managers that were particularly nice and I
will be keeping their business cards. Both their objects were nice, one of them
in particular, but it was the same price tag as here without offering any
extras (on the contrary!) and the other was significantly more and I couldn't
really see why as it didn't even have a private patio or anything to step out
on. So I will be going with the current song and say it's for your own good. Now I'm looking forward to spending the summer here by the beach where I really have everything as I rest assured that I actually AM getting an excellent deal right here and have been all along. No more annoying to do lists either! 
YAY! :)"

"event","Highs of 82/27 today. 
Must get out there and catch some rays before tackling the evil housework. I don't even want to think of what all needs to be done and I have basically 3 days left. Last night I found myself on Crenshaw at 3:30am, cruising with the cool kids while secretly listening to KZLA with the windows closed. After all it isn't the place for this kind of music, lol. The fact that I listened to it is worth mentioning as it is a rare thing of late. These 2 things, especially
in combination, take me back to a time where this country seemed greater and the future seemed brighter and this city was so perfect that I really wanted to spend time here.

I was also thinking of Steve.

That's right. Remember Steve? The one it all started with? I'm not even the same person anymore and in some ways, I'm not 100% sure if that's actually a good thing. Things were easier then, more straight forward. I hadn't yet started analysing everything I do, don't do, should do, have done and will do.
I think the time factor played a big role but so did mere age. I was a lot more
adjusted and prone to routines in those days. No time to think. After all I had to ~~make it~~ here. I do wonder what became of him and his situation, where he is today and how he's doing... 
So country music and Steve will always go together in my mind, even if *he* hardly even listened to it. This too was different then, at least for me. It was a good thing in this way where this country and this music were one to me and along with rap and hip hop reflected what was ""it"" about here. As in, *right here*. Today I can try to recreate the feeling by listening to it but there's... an aftertaste. 

In my mind it stands for Bush-supporting republicans now, people who are clueless, voted red, are the patriotic kind that so amuses me in all their
blind and ignorant glory. Right. My F jumps in and says it's not fair to make this assessment and generalise. As always it cannot possibly apply to the entire culture of those who play, invent or listen to this kind of music, blah blah. But the fact is that the so-called ""elections"" and all that was and is attached to it simply ruined it for me in many ways. I feel I cannot stand for this at all, not as a foreigner, not as an immigrant, not as anyone. That listening means supporting, and that I'm most certainly not ""those people"".
This is also so because it's so bound to their all-important ""race"" business again that it's like making a statement and taking sides.

What's the name of the dude again who looks like his IQ is about 10 who came up
with all these patriotic songs after 9/11? THAT ONE is so embarrassing that
just thinking about him makes me snicker big time."

This is a typical result for me -- polar opposites, essentially. Both apply equally depending on situation. If something works in my eyes, there's no need to ""invent"" and ""discart"" just for the sake of doing things different. When I do see a better way however, I will definitely make changes and will fight things through too, making everyone around do the same if necessary."

"event","Race obsession in America. Seen through the eyes of Europeans. There's a topic for book # 7, lol. Add Asian, African, Australian and Latin American eyes and you may be on to something. Thankfully there are those even here who don't play that game but it's so deeply-rooted to think in these terms that to me it seems as though the categorising never stops. Not a *novel* idea to write about by any means but funny and sad just the same... ""Caucasian"", eh? Makes me laugh every time."

I should really be heading to the beach. I haven't done this in ages even though it's just a couple of minutes away. It's only 9:30 but I can already feel this is going to be a scorcher that will probably top the forecasted

"event","So until a half an hour ago, I must have been the only person left in CA who
had never had California Rolls. I've started liking Asian food more and more
but never really understood the Sushi craze. So I tried the Cali Rolls and
Shrimp Tempura Maki Style, acting on an impulse just now and concluded that
it's a great summer food because it's so light and eating ""klein aber fein""
definitely won't hurt either at this point.

""California roll~~ A form of sushi made with avocados, crabmeat, cucumbers and other ingredients wrapped in vinegared rice. It was supposedly created at a Japanese restaurant in Los Angeles named Tokyo Kaikan about 1973 for the American palate but has also gained popularity in Japan, where it is called kashu-maki, a literal translation of ""California roll."" - Encyclopedia of
American Food and Drink, 1999"

And how I don't want to leave... 

Is that why I haven't done more yet? Because I'm really more attached than I think? I know I am going to cry over this. If anything is ""home"" in this part of the world, this is it. Can I let this go without feeling even more lost and unsettled? Why do I feel like if I leave here once, I can never come back?
Still lost. Still not ready. Still resisting change.

"event","Tony Danza is threatening to drive me crazy. I really want to like him because overall, he *is* a sympathetic character but he easily crosses the line to being just annoying. I remember him from that 80's show with Alyssa Milano that also ran for years in Europe. I don't think his talk show will be running very long...

Today wasn't very productive, I'm afraid. Hate to admit it but there are 5000 things to do and I'm feeling overwhelmed. It's the usual pattern where I can already see myself rushing about just before the deadline. Must find a way to motivate myself. To briefly change channels -- in terms of ideas for future artistic projects, I came across these 2 images that I like very much and should keep in mind:

Also: I now got myself completely addicted to this tiny, hole-in-the-wall kind of place called ""Thai Express"" on Artesia where they start cooking your food as you order. I have tried 3 different dishes over the last few days and so far, it beats the more dollar$$-intensive Thai Rama. Which just goes to show that more expensive doesn't necessarily mean better quality."

<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>""Following the moon's phases can actually help your hair growth. According to long hair expert Dr. George Michael, ""The moon has a magnetic influence on hair just as it does on the tides. During the first quarter of the moon, a person on earth has an extremely opposite electrical pull to the moon itself. Electric static goes through the body, through the hair, and becomes immersed into the atmosphere. The hair actually serves as a conductor of electricity, and breakage and splitting are minimized.""</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2><SMALL>Saw this yesterday and finding&nbsp;it all&nbsp;most interesting. Not necessarily true but worth looking into.&nbsp;Omi used to wash her hair with rainwater and would use apple vinegar for shine. I've noticed how in the last few years, my hair went from rather oily&nbsp;to normal/dry -- which I'm assuming it's a hormonal thing. Still trying to decide what to do with it now too, stylewise and highlightwise. </SMALL></FONT><FONT face=Verdana size=2><SMALL>More info on the moon thing here: <A href=""http://www.longhairlovers.com/moon_maintenance.html"">http://www.longhairlovers.com/moon_maintenance.html</A></SMALL></FONT></P></FONT>"

Stay away from extreme negativity. 
It multiplies and poisons the atmosphere all around.
People like that drag you down with them, drain you of your much needed energy.
You don't need that.

I was tempted to comment on the bitchiness {Good grief! All that, in an ADD ME community ad looking for FRIENDS, mind you!} -- but who needs the drama, lol."

"event","Oh dear. Must be careful with the snark but there are some statements in some communities I've browsed that really make me wonder how ignorant and stupid people can possibly be. Must keep in mind that there are a lot of kids on this thing and a lot of *cough* A's who've never been anywhere nor care or know about anything not local.. but still. Most of the time it's good for a laugh anyway.

Oh and speaking of stupidity, I just had another oh so healthy American breakfast! That's right, I went to the 24 hour diner down the street and had the most generous plate of goodies. In my defense I can say that I have been rather good these past days so there. And I walked to the place. Which is worth mentioning in this country too, and specifically, this city.

It's another gorgeous morning in Southern Cali that will turn into another gorgeous day. Meanwhile, I'm convinced that I would go insane living in anything less than subtropical climate again. When I look at Mom & Dad's weather forecast, I cringe. 50F=10C and 4 days straight of anything from light rain to showers? It's a tad unusual even for there but nonetheles: *There's* a reason why it was a good idea to leave Germany, lol.

Beach and blading with S later today, Santa Monica. 
Maybe a trip to The Promenade and some shopping afterwards."

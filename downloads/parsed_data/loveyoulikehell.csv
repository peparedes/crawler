"event","Danny booked us a holiday to Malta yesterday! I'm too too too excited! I haven't had a proper holiday since I was sixteen and the hotel and the whole island look amazing.
Life living with him is great. It's so nice to come home from work to our home together. I'm getting really domesticated. I got excited about a bath mat the other day. Depressing but true. I really, really want a cat and we've come up for names for about 4 but no furry animals allowed in the flat. We're ok to have lizards/fish but I want something fluffy and petlike.
It's Creamfields in 18 days!!"

"event","As of tonight I have eleven days of solid work. Looking at about 120 hours and I get to work over my 21st. Lucky, lucky me. I have zero plans for my birthday celebration. It's so difficult finding a time when everyone I want to be there can make it. It looks as though it'll have to be quite far after my birthday due to work and other such excitements.
Danny and I had our first weekend away this week. By weekend I mean Mon-Weds but it was still lovely. We headed down to Brighton to see Becky and Goldie Lookin' Chain. Amazing. I get so excited at seeing the sea and the beach! The hotel was gorgeous and it was so nice to get away from everything. I've been such a moody, mardy, irrational bitch recently and I'm so scared it's gonna start to get to him but it was really, really nice. No random outbursts of crying or unnecessary snappy, bitchy comments. We're hoping to be able to go away every few weeks. We're going to France for his birthday in three weeks and have planned a little trip to Blackpool to meet his family and go to his friends wedding in June. Hopefully a proper holiday soon as well. Who would've thought... Me in a proper grown up relationship.
I keep having tiny little identity crisis's (is that a word?). We have to renew our contract on the house and another year here seems slightly daunting. I keep finding myself feeling trapped in this little world of Russell, Joey and I sitting around and getting stoned. Sometimes I'm scared I'll wake up in 30 years and still be exactly where I am now. Sometimes I wish I'd done uni. Sometimes I completely despise my job. But then most days I'm completely happy"

"event","We have a car! It's shared between me, Joey and Russell as only Joey can drive and we pretty much go everywhere together anyway. We went to skeg last week. It was freezing cold, pissing it down and pretty much everywhere was closed.
Danny is in away in Australia for three weeks visiting his son. We're working over in Ireland at easter and hopefully in Barcelona in the summer. Will be debt free in a few months then gonna start saving for a couple of weeks away. We're looking at Caribbean and Hawaiian cruises but we are both shit with money so maybe we're being a bit ambitious.
Shawn is moving out next week so I finally get to move into a bigger room. I have so much stuff still in boxes. I'm looking forward to finally unpacking it all and properly moving in."

"event","Because I simply have nothing better to do right now...

2008...

01. What did you do in 2008 that you'd never done before?

02. Did you keep your new years' resolutions, and will you make more for next year?
I don't remember what they were and if I do make more I'll probably forget them as well.


03. Did someone close to you give birth?
My sister.

04. Did anyone close to you die?
No. touch wood.

05. What countries did you visit?
I don't even have a passport but next year should make up for that.

No debt, holidays, a really good birthday, more time with old friends.

07. What date from 2008 will remain etched upon your memory, and why?
27th feb-27th march for very private reasons
21st April - moved out
28th june - mine and Danny's first date

08. What was your biggest achievement(s) of the year?
Getting my life back on track after the whole ""rob and everything"" situiation, quitting smoking.

09. What was your biggest failure(s)?
Letting the whole ""rob and everything"" situation get how it got, I didn't put enough time or effort into seeing people I should've seen.

10. Did you suffer illness or injury?
Nothing too bad

11. What was the best thing you bought?
Deposit on the house

12. Whose behavior merited celebration?
My sisters. She's an amazing mum.

13. Whose behavior made you appalled and depressed?
Robs, Johns.

14. Where did most of your money go?
Into my house, paying off debt.

15. What did you get really, really, really excited about?
Creamfields, moving out, Danny.

17. Compared to this time last year, are you:

Thinner or fatter? 
A bit fatter cuz this year I can afford to eat.

Richer or poorer? 
Richer

18. What do you wish you'd done more of?
Exercise and I wish I'd taken more photos.

19. What do you wish you'd done less of?
Stressing, crying, what if-ing

22. Did you fall in love in 2008?
No

2

24. What was your favorite TV program?

26. What was the best book you read?
Running with scissors, Invisible monsters, Good omens.

27. What was your greatest musical discovery?
Not really a discovery but dancing to Born Slippy in a state of ecstatic bliss at Creamfields was the musical highlight.

28. What did you want and get?
An amazing job, a relationship, a pet (which i quickly didn't want), a house with Russell and Joey.

29. What did you want and not get?
A holiday.

30. Favorite film of this year?
Juno, Across the Universe.

31. What did you do on your birthday, and how old were you?
I was 20 and it was kind of a write off this year.

32. What one thing would have made your year immeasurably more satisfying?
If I'd cleared all my debt.

33. How would you describe your personal fashion concept in 2008?
I've barely bought any clothes this year. I tend to wear clothes, not outfits. I'm a jeans and t-shirt girl. But I did fall in love with stockings.
 
34. What kept you sane?
Friends, family, Danny.

35. Which celebrity/public figure did you fancy the most?
I seem to have developed a thing for slightly older, slightly on the large side men with brown hair (ie, guys who look like Danny) and have an embarrassing crush on Nick Frost. Wrong.

37. Who do you miss?
I miss lots of old friends from school, the good times with Rob, my Mum, Danny when he goes back to Blackpool, Cherry when I don't see her for a while, Russell and Joey if we don't see each other for a few days cuz we spend too much time together and I'm needy.

38. Who was the best new person you met?
Everyone from work including a lot of the players. Jayden.

39. Tell us a valuable life lesson you learned in 2008.
Shit happens and there's no point wasting time on What If's. Debt is so much easier to get into than it is to get out off. Things will always get better, then they'll get bad again, then better. That's life. Be nice to people cuz karma is a bitch.

40. Quote a song lyric that sums up your year:
""I'll get by with a little help from my friends, I'll get high with a little help from my friends""


My resolutions for 2009 are as follows...
To not stress about the little things."

"event","So much has happened in the last year. I've done so many things I'm proud of and a hell of a lot I'm not. I've learnt a lot and I feel I've grown up loads. I've got through some majorly shit things and acheived a lot (even if there not the usual acheivements like passing driving tests and stuff). I've got my life to a place where I'm happy despite people not always believing in or supporting me. I like to think I treat other people better than I used to and I dont let other people treat me like shit. I've learnt how to say sorry and accept other peoples apologies. I can move on from things and learn from them. I can take criticism and accept compliments. I worry less about what other people think and am more driven to make things better for myself and the people I care about. I'm sorting out my money and making plans that I'll actually follow through. I've lost touch with a lot of people on the way but, although I know that's part of life, I never stopped caring. I still think about them and am always just a phone call away. I hope they know that years of friendship don't just disappear and even if we never speak again, I'll always remember the times we had and appreciate the influence they had on me as a person. I don't get quite as bitter, jealous or insercure as I used to. I don't diet. I do things in moderation. I spend less time wondering and more time doing. I haven't got a massive amount of qualifications or material things and I don't live in luxury but I'm comfortable and I'm very very happy."

the rob things is sorted (to an extent). we avoid talking about our feelings, pretend that we don't actually intend to sleep together when i go round, have a few hours of general nicey nice ""rob and rachael, being friends, having a laugh and not planning on sleeping with each other""-ness, act like its a bit of a shock when we do end up in bed then spend the rest of the day/night/whatever in a happy, coupley-ish bubble of pink fluffiness which is promptly burst when i go home/he goes to work/his girlfriend phones. hmmmmm....."

""The Pinnacle, is a development of 104 luxury apartments, located just on the edge of the city centre. Spread over 17 floors; complete with far reaching views; a professional investor, low maintenance interior specification and a 10 year Zurich warranty, this fully refurbished development fills a unique niche in the Nottingham property market"" 

it has a residents only gym and a concierge. 
cheap as fuck cuz my kitchen manager got dumped and can't afford it so he's subletting it to me for almost nothing. love love love it. i know i love love'd my old places but this is ACTUALLY nice. flat warming soon me'thinks.
my new job is a ball ache to get too but going pretty well.
saw dan the other day. decided to ring me at 11:45pm on a saturday to see what i'm doing. i'm at the pub with my friend thank you very much. and he turned up and it was messy and i cried and i was battered but he fucked off and i don't think he'll try and ""spontaneously burst back into my life"" any time soon.
me and rob are messy. not in a good way. went from friends to sleeping together to feelings to love and want to be with you. which is lovely apart from his girlfriend thing (i know i'm a bad person for getting myself into this situation and i keep trying to justify it but i am shit....oh well)"

"event","dan said he loved me. which i guess is good as i said it to him a few weeks ago. it should all be happy happy nicey nicey now. but it's not. i went to the wedding and got completely wasted, accused the father of the bride of liking men and not being scottish (he was wearing a kilt). dan was (quite rightly) slightly embarressed but i couldn't stop thinking that the other person i like would've done exactly the same as me in that situation and we would've got wasted together which would've been great. me and cherry applied at wetherspoons last night! definately want a job there! fo' sho'. me and joey are making a joint bank account sometime soon so we can save up for the deposit on a flat then start looking when we both have proper jobs. but moving in with joey is gonna make things awkward with dan as he's ""not completely comfortable"" with me living with him. i've spent far too much money on cds (you get weird looks when you buy damien rice and pendulum at the same time)"

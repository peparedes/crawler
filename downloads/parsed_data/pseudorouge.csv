"event","I guess this could be for everyone who actually wants something to read... maybe it will be interesting, but most likely, it will be my useless babblings of the day's events..
Who knows, maybe it could actually get a little bit philosophical!

So today, I was woken up at 7:30 this morning to watch the cousins (being that I'm down here in North Carolina) so my aunt could take my cousin to his doc appointment.  Grr.  Oh, and I went to bed at 3 because my aunt was drunk, and she enjoys talking (very much so) when she is drunk.  And she wouldn't let me go to bed.
I have sworn away at alcohol for my entire time in North Carolina.  So I believe the countdown is 42 days now.. unless my AP Calc-status self can't count the days from now until August 24th.  Sadly, this is highly likely.  Then I may go home, and take the drinking strike to the grave.. or home.  I dunno, it's too much to think about at this time..

I went around looking for jobs yesterday, and filled out apps for Subway, Pizza Hut, Blockbuster, Harris Teeter, and this Sauce Italian Restaurant place.  But I think I'll either wind up at Subway or Pizza Hut, because I can only work for another 5-6 weeks and then I'm skipping out.  Usually I'm not one to back out quickly, but the fact of the matter is I need work to make the down payment on my car insurance when I get home, which will probably be monstrous.

Oh, by the way, this is what I'm working for:

I'm in love...  with special thanks to my mom, this sucker will be in my yard this Labor Day =)

And I miss everyone at home.. hopefully this will keep people on their toes about what I'm up to"

"event","so after the whole infiltration and sunbathing, i chilled and went to bed, if i remember correctly.
then i woke up saturday and went tanning again, just basking out on the pier and such... got some sun =)  then i went to kohl's and bought a new outfit.. and then mego and i went to the boarwalk.
i met the coolest guy ever named vinnie vandermaas (he's cooler than the other vin, i think), and he gave me and mego 20,000 arcade points (prolly equivalent to like... $250-$300 benny dollars), and with that i bought an incredibly bad burberry fake.  woot.  then b picked us up and we went to amandas.. and then we drove around and there was a sleepover and such.
so then amanda and i went to pat's for lunch so i could have my cherished chicken parm with fruit punch and sprite mixed up.  hmm.. then she dropped me off at amy's and we went to dq's.  and then it got interesting.
she needed her car washed bc pollen killed her sexy sport car's red luster, so we drove down to beach cos there was a nifty car wash there with a cool garagey thing.  so we went through it and upon exiting there was adam, who apparently works there and is seen mowing the place's lawn.  again.  geez i feel like a stalker but it was totally not planned.
totally not planned, but funny.  that's what the encounters were this time... not all <b>""omg it's adam, let me change my persona and crawl into a hole and wither away, yet make my presence known at the same time.""</b>  it was just, <i>""oh, it's adam.  it's funny.  let me wave and laugh with my friends for all things passed. and perhaps i'll say hi and meet his new girlfriend.  best of luck to them, seriously.""</i> it was quite the liberating feeling. =)
anyways, amy dropped my off at courtney's, and we talked forever of our love lives (or lack thereof).  then we went to TACO BELL and back to my mom's.  we took an illegal cruise around in my mom's supercool suv too. i love courtney.
now i'm here. and leaving tomorrow after some parade in toms river.
i wanna go to seaside, though :("

"event","so i woke up at 6:41, and showered and there was no conditioner or a hairbrush, and that really ticked me off (my mom has short hair, so there was only shampoo and a comb) so my hair was a wirey mess :-(
but i survived
anyways...
...then i drove over to my mom's ""program"" and met all of the people that work with her and fellow recoverers. then she had her therapy session and finished by 10, so i begged madre to drive me to point so i could meet my friends for lunch 
and so she did :) 

so first i ran into amanda and that was so perfect!!! then we went to go get alyssa and meggles and beki (spell check?) (cool girl!) and they were totally surprised.  i love surprising people.  then we drove to jersey mikes to eat, and on our way there we saw my ex who wasnt expecting me at all, so the look on his face was priceless as usual
and yeah we ate some, and went back to the school cafeteria (infiltration was successful :-D) and i saw even more people!!!!!
and then the ex came back and the crew laughed (some things never change...) and like yelled halfway across the cafeteria (which is about 1/4 the size of PM west's), lol) ""aimee gargiulo, what are you doing here?!"" it was funny.
then i said, ""well, you know me, i always come back for more!"" ;) which is true because i love that surprised look... turns out, his gf was right there, whoops.. 
so then when the bell rang i got to say hey and officially and introduced myself to his new girlfriend... then i was like, ""yeah, all is well, i'm just, you know, kickin' it in pensy"" and put a big smile on my face. which is true, i love everyone up there too <33

AHHHH I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

then i came back here (bayville) and then went to the beach/pier nearby... and sunbathed for like 3 hours and got (somewhat) tan!!
but now im here and bored
i even talked to dennis, which is where nearly all of this text came from (what can i say, i didn't want to type the same thing twice!).

and oh yeah, i bought conditioner and a brush
so that made my day that much better"

hmm.. i'm missing school right now.. sweet.  but aimee can't stay out of school when she's supposed to be there.  so, i'm going to go on a covert operation to sneak into my old school and see people.. but that's not for a little while.

i'm really flustered because i forgot my uber-important history notebook to get that work done. crud.
so now i've resorted to draining away online and doing monotonous SAT problems.  i'm taking those this weekend and i'm so nervous... and i heard flippin' MEGGLES XD got a 2150 on her SAT's... nice work you punk.

"event","whoa.
that last entry is pretty trippy.
haha it really was fun though <3

anyways, i just wanted to say <b>i'm sorry</b> to all of my point friends, i feel as if i have been neglecting you, but since track and all the other stuff i've been up to is pretty much done, i'm definitely gonna try to catch up =)

<i> i like you. </i>

i don't remember what i did friday, but i think i hung out with maretta. or dennis.  i forget.  what i do remember was driving out to wilkes-barre to pick tyler up from twist at one in the morning, and that place seems rather entertaining.
saturday, i went to main gate, and lindsey called me up and said i could sleep over that night.  so i hurried home, because no matter what i seem to be entertained when her and i hang out. her and MARTHA picked me up, and we went back to her house.. so did some other people.  everyone that i saw that night was neat-o, except that dumb bizzotch that had to come.  eh.  well, case in point, saturday was rather eventful.
yesterday, i came home, but on the way i picked up jenny.  she was distraught, so i rescued her (thanks to lindsey) - yay for me.  but those guards were scary that day =(  so we chillaxed for like 2 hours, but then we drove her home.  then dennis came over and we aimlessly wandered around our lovely neighborhood.  he has inspired me to (at least try) to stop cursing, so that explains the lack of f-bombs and such.  hmmm.. yeah then i went to bed, only to be rushed outta the house this morning.
today was really dull, but it was one of those days where i just didn't care.  i came home and took a nap on my van (ask derrick and eric, they saw me :P).  then i -gasp- worked out.


and as for my future plans, so everyone knows:
school is out either on the 8th or 10th of june, or something like that.
TEXASSSSSSS from june 13-29 (i'll come back tan and blonde)
POINT PLEASANT (tentative... :-/) 29ish through 5th
NORTH CAROLINA from after the 4th events till the end of summer.

this weekend i slept over at jen's this saturday, and we went to the mall and everything and it was fun, as usual.  
the night before, i was being a retarded asshole dancing around and pretending that i knew all the lyrics to the music the radio was playing.. but that didn't fly over too well ;)

she also clued me in to what some dumbasses have been saying about me (for most who actually know me, your jaw is about to drop; afterwards, you will proceed to laugh your ass off):
<b> i, aimee gargiulo, am a slut </b>
<u> AAAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA </u>
lol, last i checked i'm still a virgin in all aspects, and i've only been with one person since i moved up here.. and that was my boyfriend.  and that ended like a month ago and it's ancient history.  so what's the beef?  people are fucking assholes.

oh yeah, speaking of such personages =)  i dumped marc, definitely not the other way around.  he can say what he wants to boost his self-esteen or whatever, but the truth is right here in front of your face.  not that it matters because, once again, it ended a month ago.  
and damn straight i didn't put out, it's a damn good thing i didn't.

and the contradiction that everyone who really knows me say:
""but aimee, how are you a slut, yet your ex said you didn't put out?""
tell me, we would love to know."

yesterday, i watched platoon and i didn't get it.. except for the platoon trying to kill itself.  vietnam seems crazy, and it reminds me of a jungley iraq.
scary, mon.

i also ""jammed"" and aimlessly wandered around my neighborhood with dennis yesterday, after we had track.  this went on for a few hours.  -handshake- i also discovered that norm lived up here, and that's cool too.

and out of nowhere, becca appeared on my front door step.
i was all grunged out in my hoodie n jamamas, and i looked like crap, and i was about to start a homework assignment... and that totally went down the tubes 'cos BEEEEE WAS HEEEEEEEEEEEEEERE XD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
to celebrate, tyler and i took it upon ourselves to show her around the neighborhood, and since there's no streetlights and it was 10 before we decided to really do anything, we were able to sneak out of the house... with my minivan.
and bee likes my minivan so fuck you all.  i kinda like it too.
1992 navy blue plymouth voyager bitches <33
anywho, the van isn't registered, and well it doesn't exactly have a license plate on it, either... and i don't even have my license... but yeah i kinda took it out anyway.
so we went to get maretta so she could meet bex, and i guess they hit it off okay, and then i showed becca other personage's houses that we talk to.  it was so fun and random... and -gasp- risky.
but then she had to go home and i was stuck in that goddamn sat math class.  blegh.

"event","so much fun things have happened.  i suppose.

for one, it was evan's birthday on the 22nd, so now he can almost legally drive!! WHOREAY!!!!!  i love my evanpher <33

also on that friday i donated blood and almost passed out.  it was really funny, i like.. entered a twilight zone or something.  i'm happy i did it, though.

on the 23rd it was squindo's birthday, so happy birthday to you too!  i would im him, but my aim seems to be failing me -pout-

also, the 23rd brought some sadness upon me.  for those who should recall, it would be a one year anniversary of something that had a lot of potential if i didn't move out here.  caitlin, perhaps you could remember?
so i was cleaning my room on this day (considering it was a gloomy saturday), and i found a crazy old folder i haven't looked in for a while.  go figure, as soon as a open it, the madison phone directly falls out into the b section, and a drawn picture of caitlin hurling a shoe at mr. sangemino's head going ""eieieieieieieiei!!!!"" falls out that he drew as well.  yes, i am a complete sap, and i saved it.  on the back, jennie even wrote ""aimee, you smell like weiner -jennie"".  as if this wasn't enough, a conversation from the end of august fell out afterwards.  that's when i remembered everything, and i read the conversation and it just triggered <b>something</b>.  frankly, i almost cried.  i forgot how much he meant to me, but hey what can you do, right?
sorry, i just had to reflect some.

on a happier note, i have met someone up here that strongly reminds me of him.  he looks nothing like a superhot tan dark haired dude, but he is soooooooo <i>quiet</i>!!  he'll open up around me on occasion, but in school we hardly acknowledge each other's existence.  hmm.. everyone reading this knows i love a challenge ;) bring it on, bitch.

and there was the national honor society induction yesterday.  boring and drawn out.  blegh.

and oman, dennis drove me home again today... well, almost.  he let me drive his truuuuuuuuuck -gushes- so pretty, and it's <b>stick shift!!!</b>  my only experience with a stick shift car was with my padre's supershitty honda civic, and yeah i suck at first starting and shifting into first.  eek.  but anyways, we got to my house, and i reminded him that he offered me the chance to drive his truck.  so he actually let me!!!!!!  oman, everyone would be SO PROUD!!! XD and i wasn't that bad at it, i only stalled it like 7 times in 15-20 minutes - and EVERY FRICKIN TIME was when i was shifting from neutral to first from a stop.  so that's definitely my weak point.  he graded me as a 6 =)  i think i may have surprised him with my natural ability to move the stick ;)

jenny picked me up and we went to see Les Miserables at east campus.  it was really good, and that school is mondohuge.  and reggie's girlfriend was there, and although jenny was mortified i thought it was really funny.  i wish i went to school at east instead, and there is a gorgeous view of camelback from there.  damn those rich counterparts of the pocono mountain school district..
then i slept over at jenny's.  we talked about sir reginald, of course, and then of course he called.  so i went to sleep.  hmm.. then we went to the mall, and as usual i didn't buy anything.  i ate over there and now i'm here.  woo frickin hoo.

I sucked at the track meet, and now I have blood blisters and such on my fingers.  I even threw javelin and managed to get 3rd place, but considering that the other team only had two throwers and got 1st and 2nd, that really blows a goat.
I met Ian Walsh finally, but he is definitely way overrated and I don't like him.  He's just hot to look at, but that's it.
Hmm.. I also met Chris Cassidy and he's pretty cool.  Way better than the everglorious Ian Walsh.
Why the hell must these people be related to as first and last name..
So after the meet, which the girls won and the guys lost, I was like ""PADRE! I want Taco Bell.  He didn't have much of a say though because.. well, I was driving.  Po0r Soul.  So I drove our asses to Taco Bell, and I went in by myself.  There were about 4 guys working there, all of which around my age, and probably went to East.  So the first guy took my order, the second guy just kinda looked at me, then the last two kept on looking at me all weird and such.  So I just kept on glancing away... then my order came up, and the third guy (one of the compulsive starers) was like, ""can I have your number?"".  And I was shocked.  First of all, I look like crap... track sweats, hair pulled up, no make up, and my face was probably red from embarrassment to boot.  So because I don't just give my number out to strangers... although he may have been kinda cute... I told him I had a boyfriend.  But then I think I made up for it because I remembered him and told him so.. so maybe that boosted his ego a little bit?  I dunno, whatever.  But I was in such a bad mood I didn't wanna deal with it.
Besides, I like someone new. Again.  Maybe more details later.

finally, these days don't seem to be so boring and monotonous! 

i love being on track (more like field), and i'm working on my throwing.  i even stay after some practices to work harder and just get better.  maybe i'll even get around to pole vaulting again.

so far, i've even dropped 5 pounds - most likely because of track.  this has motivated me to (somewhat) eat better, so hopefully this will help me lose even more =)

i had my first conversation beyond ""hey, how's it goin'?"" with marc today since we broke up.  it wasn't even weird or anything... this is so cool.  and i dunno i'm just living it up being single and such.  i love having no strings attached and everything as of now, but i know later i'll wanna settle down again (with someone else, that is).  question is, with who?  hmmm.. -ponders- so little yet so many possibilities...

sweet.

i had track practice today, yet no way to get there.  oh well, guess i'm missing our first meet.
so now i'm bored and wanna see someone.

ohh yeah.. <lj-cut text=""some pondering""> 
i hate myself.  i really don't know what to do!  i really think i wanna break up with him, yet i don't have the heart to.  i keep telling myself ""things will change"", yet they don't.  i think we have just grown apart, and i can't tell what he's thinking (i don't have x-ray vision, you know..).  it just sucks.  i'm still gonna ride it out, although i don't think i'm entirely happy in the relationship, and i can find something better for myself (although the someone i'm in with is absolutely wonderful - but not as my boyfriend).
besides, i have a new school girl crush on someone else;; someone so entirely different from anyone i've ever gone out with.  
i always surprise myself with this.  first guy was an uber-sensitive emo punk pale bass kid in a band.  second was a mistake, yet was crazy tall and uber-sensitive long-haired poet younger kid.  third wasn't really a boyfriend, yet he was a eclectic mondo jock senior (i was a sophomore) that got along with everyone - and quite frankly, he was a very promiscuous person (unlike the previous two).  then there was fate - one of like two guys that could possibly be somewhat right for me in mhs - yet once again completely different from everyone i liked before.  tan, dark hair, dark eyes, quiet and super-shy, drinker, and very athletic build. after this, there was a hookup with another younger guy playing drums, light hair and eyes, and sensitive and understanding to everyone's needs.  now, i'm with a guy with a bald head and brown eyes, big football player dude that keeps to himself and doesn't tell anyone anything (except for threatening to beat other people up).  he just doesn't care about anything, and i don't get it - or him.  as for the prospective dude (which will probably never happen, yet i'll describe anyway), he is the mother of different for me.  
he's a ghetto fabulous wigger kid - and usually i can't stand this sort of person, yet i hit it off with him.  he's taken (another odd one for me), and has an <u>afro</u> or cornrowed red hair. he lives for rap music.  i don't like rap much.  he dresses black, he lives the life of someone straight from like - brooklyn! he smokes (never dated a smoker), and deals stuff sometimes, so i hear.  since when do i extensively associate with dealers? yet at the same time, he can listen to other music (my music, lol), and understand everything i'm talking about.  <b> he likes my  stupid stories! </b>  he listens to me when i have problems, when i'm living a daydream, and responds with a sincerity i can't describe. <b> he cares, </b> and that's more than my current guy can ever say.  ugh, this sucks."

first i met jennie, and that was cool.  me her and tyler were at her house for a little while, and then we left to find people.  we went to rosa's house, and dominick was there, and tyler went to go get louie.  so we were all hanging out and then we left to see louie and nana and tony, the latter two were grounded :(  um, yeah then we took pictures and mingled and such, and then these other random kids came... mike and steph i think but i didn't talk to them much.  then me tyler, jenny, dominick and louie all went back to jennie's house, and fixed stuff on the computer and hung out, listened to music and played cards.  then kristin and this random chick nicole came too, but since she talked crap about me and i didn't even know what she <i>looked like</i> till last night, i avoided her.  besides that, all was well, and i even persuaded padre to pick us up later than he usually picks up tyler -->  try an hour and half later :P

Saturday, on the other hand, was fun.
First I went on an expedition to Bangor (the closest Bank of America) about half an hour away.. maybe more?  So I cashed the check Mother gave me a month ago.. then went home. 
Then Collin called me!  And I was so happy because I was <i>really</i> bored at this time.  So I got my ass down to his house and OMG HE HAS THE CUTEST TOY POODLE EVER <33  Anyways we went to the Stroud Mall, and I bought stuff for soccer.. like shinguards and shorts (I'm not buying anything else till I know I make the team..).  Then we went to Ruby Tuesday and I had the greatest buffalo chicken sandwich ever.  I would recommend it to the Pope for chrissake.  Then I went home.
Three stories for Musto's class on Monday :
1) At the mall, this guy clicked on a pop-up, and the computer screamed, ""I LOVE GAY PORN!!!"" really loudly, and it was hilarious.  The whole store started laughing.. like.. was he really looking at gay porn?
2) I nearly killed Collin as we crossed 611 to eat.  Yeah I cut him off and he fell in the middle of the road .:.whoops.:. SORRY COLLIN!!!
3) The infamous hot girls wave at Collin... or so he thinks.  So he waves back and the girls got all confused and such.. so then they waved at him.  Then, Collin realized that they weren't waving at him to begin with.  Haha.
When Collin dropped me at home, I proceeded to rescue Miss Jennifer from her drunken household.  She slept over and we ate alot and drank alot of apple juice.  Then Marc called and we had a nice phone date, and I was so hyperactive off apple juice that he really thought I was drunk.  It was really funny.

Then Sunday (today) Marc came over!  We went on an expedition to Walmart.. and watched a football movie (The Program).  But yeah, it was fun, and it was our first time hanging out solo for a couple of weeks.  But then he left and I was really bored, and continue to be so now.

So all in all, this weekend was good, and I'm ready to carpe noche (yeah, latin and spanish together, shut up.)."

I really haven't been up to anything.. soccer tryouts are on Monday, cuts are on Friday.  I really hope I make the cut, because I need to a) get in shape and b) make more friends.  Worse case scenario, I don't make that team and do track instead.  I've taken a new interest in running - don't know why, it just takes my mind off things.  And how cool would it be to fly temporarily (like polevaulting or high jump or something.  Or I could hurl a javelin like some ancient Greek chick... anyways, there's a lot of options if soccer doesn't work out.
I got my National Honor Society application yesterday, and handed it in today.  I really want to be in that more than like.. anything (at this point, anyway).

Then at around 5-ish, we found Shane, and he was with a bunch of random people, and we thought, ""hey, we should all go together"".  So we did.  I met Sean (aka Norway), John (aka Ferd), and Tom (aka... Tom.).  There were a couple other people too, but I didn't talk to them or anything, so those are the cool people.  I had soooo much fun with them, and I went to the Terrain Park, and actually went over one piece of ""terrain"" (and I didn't fall!!!).  Andi also improved most incregiously.

2) Gym/SAT math/SAT verbal
3) Sociology

4) H. American Issues
So someone better be in these classes.

In english, we drew funny pictures, and got a class shot, with me in middle looking like a jackass, and Terrence laying across me and Lindsey and such.  It's quite a funny picture :)
In anatomy, Trisha came back :)  Too bad it was the last day of the semester.  I talked to Aaron today about Tyler and gayness and such.  Him, me, and Mr. D had some laughs in class today (while I was basically ignored by everyone else).
For functions, I played card games with Andrea, Sam, and that random Dan kid I never talked to during this entire semester.
Fourth period blew, as usual.  There was a fire drill and a junior class meeting (where the vp bitched about pssa's).  Oh yeah, a secret admirer got me a stuffed animal too, how cute!  But yeah, I have a bf, lol. <3

Uhh.. hmm.  Oh yeah the insight part.
I think I'm losing touch with people.  Am I withdrawing intentionally? No.  It just happens.  Shit happens.  You just drift apart, and no one puts in effort because there's just no need to.  There's no desire to. You think, what's the point of forcing yourselves together if there's just nothing there?

At first I wasn't going to get up because we have another snowday.  But then Dee said Padre wasn't gonna go to work.  I should have known that she didn't know how stupid he could be.
For those of you who don't know the padre, he is an immensely stubborn sonuvabitch, especially in the morning.  He is full-fledged testosterone and refuses to get help from anyone, even if his chances of doing something by himself are grim.  Basically, he is the stereotypical male.
Now that that is said, lets flash back to 6:30 a/m.
Padre is trying to pull the medical van, full of supplies, out of our icey ditch of a lawn / parking lot.  Is he successful?  No.  He's trying to gun the godforsaken van onto the road! But if that van actually made it out, he may have not been able to stop in time, and gone into the other, deeper ditch on the <i> other side </i> of the road.  That damn van just kept on skidding and sliding on the ice, and he fishtailed into our trees and almost hit our Mercury.  He finally got the ingenuous idea (after us girls watching helplessly out my bedroom window) (he refused help from every last one of us) to pull the Mercury out, pull the van into its old place and pull out onto the road ice free.
Although he was ultimately successful in his endeavors, he scared the bloody hell out of all of us this morning.  But kudos to him anyway.
All the same, our lawn is completely thrashed up.  He completely uprooted dirt, mud, etc, and it just looks horrible.  And if the younger ones don't go outside and try to smooth it out, we may not even be able to park our cars for a while.. eek.
Thank you for listening to my pointless babble.

another day bored at home, unless Jenny can come over later <3"

"event","Sooo today is my birthday.
Today was also a snow day.
Therefore, I had no school on my birthday.. but I kinda wanted to go.  No one really remembered it was my birthday except for a few people.. even my dad forgot last night!  Basically, I can count the amount of people that remembered on one of my hands.  Oh well, what can one do..

I feel really lethargic and didn't get dressed.

I talked to Marc and he asked me out.  And I told him to ask me out in person. (I hate being asked out on the phone) So hopefully tomorrow will go down as a good day in my history books.  :)

Does anybody (Meghan) notice my tendency to have someone new every birthday?  It's like a curse or something.."

 <lj-cut>
Soo.. the rest of Point Pleasant was awesome!!!

<b> Friday </b>  When Amanda woke up, Chris Pirone (haven't seen him since frosh year) was at her house! I was in shellshock, and I looked horrible, too! lmao, he just got his license the day before, so we went to Bagelicious and got bagels.. and we made a quick stop by Court's house again (I forgot something there).  Then Chris left and Amanda and I just chilled for a while.. then it was time to get ready for Villa Vittoria.
Then we got picked up by Alyssa's mom and we headed over to B's house, after that we went to eat.  I had a ""Seafood Melody"" and that cost me abuot $31 with a tip.  Our total bill was about $217.
Now that's called fancy dining, lmao!!
After this, we went back to B's, had some fun, watched the ball drop, took pictures, and all the such.  I was the first to conk out, because I felt miserable.

<b> Saturday </b>  I was also the first one up, because I still felt miserable.  I went back over to my neighbor's house, and saw Joey (Marie's nephew), and he's doing well.  After a couple hours of catching up, he walked me over to Alyssa'a house, and we hung out.  We took a random bike ride up to the boardwalk (it was about 60 degrees at the time, absolutely gorgeous XD), and I saw the ocean again, and it was so beautiful.  Then we eventually went home and had dinner.  Then, we drove over to Courtney's house, where they threw me a 
<i>surprise party!!!!</i>  I felt sooooo loved!!! I love all of my friends down there, they are amazing :)  After this, I slept over at Meghan's house, and we stayed up pretty late.  We bonded.  I love my Meggles :-P

<b> Sunday </b>  Took the 10:32 train to Newark.  Made a train buddy so I wouldn't die on the train... and then Gram picked me up.  Then Padre picked me up from Madison and I went home.  Then I went to sleep for 4 hours, and had trouble falling asleep...

<b> OAA Mission Complete :) </b> </lj-cut>

Then today in school, I got to see everybody again, and for the most part, people liked my brown hair better than my red hair :)  I got a 100 on my paper for english, so that was pretty wonderful.  We also had to present, and 2 different comments were...
1) nice hair. ps: nice shirt too
2) (insert phone number) call me
These two cracked me up.  If only they could spell my name right, lmao.
Reg and I also (finally) presented our anatomy projects, so I'm pretty much all up to speed, except I have the massive math portfolio due and I lost it, and now I have a stupid EARTH SCIENCE report due on Jupiter.
And finals are approaching, as is my birthday.
11 more days of 1st semester
2 days till my birthday!"

"event","So while my dear friend Amanda is catching up on her beauty sleep, I figured I'd come online and update, so I don't have a massive entry for when I get to Pensy.

So, to make a long story short, I'm at home again.
But to lengthen the story some..

<b> OAA Mission #2 </b>

Day 1: Tuesday
Dee drove me to Madison that morning.  Upon arrival, I went to a diner with my Gram, and then I was dropped off at EVANPHER'S house!  We hung out with my lustmonster <3 and then when she left we watched Edward Scissorhands.  I returned to Gram's house to find Bee sitting on a chair.  Hell, I wasn't gonna complain :) We shot the shit till about 10-10:30ish.  And then I called Marc and we talked till like 1.

Day 2: Wednesday
Gram dropped me off at Newark Penn Station, and I proceded to get on my 8:53 express train to Point!  When I got there at 11:13 (or, in theory), Adam picked me up.  OMFG, we are all getting sooooo old.  When we hung out last, he had to trek through snow and such on his bike - now he drives! :(  AHHHH I'm in such denial about everyone getting older.  But anyway, we drove out to Best Buy, and got Quiznos and such.  Then we had to go get his friend Tasha and bring her to work.  Then we finally went back to his house... boy, did that bring back some memories.. but we won't get too much into that.  We just played guitar some and talked.  Then when I said it was time to go, he seemed to delay for like... HALF AN HOUR by showing me pics from a gazillion years ago. Right.  Then, when I asked him where we stand (for my own closure purposes, and to find out if we were hooking up anytime soon.. yeah, bad aimee), he said we were friends.  I guess he had a change of heart from when we last talked.. either that, or he totally had a serious chickening out fest.  He drove me to Courtney's, and then we hugged goodbye (upon my advance).
Four things that went wrong with this occasion:
1) He didn't even offer to pay for Quiznos.
2) I was made to get in the back of the car..
3) He blatantly bored me.
4) He led me on. <u>Again.</u>
He is - by far - the most confusing guy I have ever laid eyes upon.  So I am now officially done with him, and will probably never talk to him again, knowing my malfuncional luck and his deviant tactics.  I am very content that he is out of my system.  So long, Mr. Pink Guitar, have a nice life...
Then, I proceded to hang out with Courtney.  I got to see Tobey, Rachel, and Nikki again - the spiffiest dogs I know.  And we played the Sims (just like old times), and ate chicken quesadillas.  Then Amanda, Alyssa, and Meghan O came over, and Mr. Norton drove us to Loews to see Meet the Fockers.  That movie was <i> hilarious </i>!!! Afterwards, we went to Applebees for some dessert :D, at which time my lovely friends decided to tell the staff that it was my birthday without my consent.  Oman, I was pretty embarrassed, but I felt so loved by my friends.  I don't know of anyone else that would do something like that for me.. We went into Barnes and Noble to find Meg's dad, only to find out he was in the car anyway.  I was dropped off at Courtney's, where we pretty much hit the sack upon arrival.

Day 3: Thursday
The next morning (yesterday), while Courtney went to track practice, I saw my old neighbors, and chilled with them till about 10:30.  Then I went back to Court's only to find out that I needed to leave quickly for Alyssa's. So, I went there :)  We tried to find a place that was open, but there wasn't anything except for Bagelicious.  So we ate there and caught up on some one-on-one conversation.  Then we just hung out at her house, and Amy came to get me (yes, she has her license now.. oh no! lol, jk..) in her 2000 red firebird.. lucky bitch.  But I love her anyway.  We have been friends since third grade, and we are sooo different, but somehow we manage to be friends, and this is very cool.  So we went to Mike's Subs to see her boyfriend, Nick, and we bought snack food.  mmm.. food... after we hung for a while, she drove me to AMANDA'S house! And Amanda and I got Tony's Pizza, so I ate a CHICKEN PARM :D  Amanda also got me settled into a New Year's Eve outfit.  So I am eternally in debt to her.  We had some heart-to-heart, and watched Spiderman 2 (didn't really think it was that good..), and conked out while watching Anchorman.

Day 4: Friday. aka today
I'm here, waiting for Amanda to arise.
Tonight shall be amazing :) <3"

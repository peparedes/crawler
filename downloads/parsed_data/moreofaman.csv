"event","The day was perfect.

Clear skies, reasonably warm, no wind. 

Red and white roses decorating the terrace, discreet rows of chairs before the small platform.

The minister beaming, thrilled as always to be doing God's work in joining two in matrimony and love.

Their friends assembled, the musicians quietly set up, Roger directing them with terse words and a thrilled expression. Mark stood nearby, his camera ever rolling, recording the moment, though no one would ever forget an instant.

At least, that was what Mama Marquez thought. She had cooed and fussed over Angel when he and Mimi had finally appeared, fixing his makeup, straightening his wig. And <i>not crying</i>. No tears to be seen whatsoever. Just as Papi had not cried either, or told Angel how honored he was to stand as his father.

~~~~~

His father fussed over his tie, his mother crooned at seeing him in a suit and looking <i>so very handsome, just like your father, baby.</i>

""You've got the rings,"" he asked for the fifth time, earning a threat to tape his mouth shut. Out of respect for his parents, Collins didn't elect to say the first thing that had popped into his mind and quieted down.

""You've got nothing to worry about, son,"" his father told him after his mother left to see to the guests. ""Angel's a keeper.""

Once again, Collins restrained the impulse to say the images that had leaped to mind. Instead, he stood shoulder to shoulder with his father, taking comfort in his presence (and oh how glad he was to have it) until Roger came to get him.

~~~~~

Sara, Faith, and Mimi looked lovely, but Collins had no eyes for them.

Roger, Mark, and Murphy looked handsome, but Angel did not notice.

All they could see was--

<i>He looks so damned beautiful I don't know why he chose me--
So handsome so strong how the hell'd I get so lucky to hear him that night--</i>.

If asked, neither could mention a thing about the ceremony, not even when sliding on their rings and repeating their vows.

But they remembered the kiss. And the kiss was enthusiastic enough to get a laughing threat from Mama about finding a bucket of water to dump on them.

Surrounded by their families and friends, Angel Dumott Schunard and Thomas Collins united in marriage in the eyes of the law. 

But they had long since been united in love."

He woke up several hours after he and Collins had fallen asleep.

<i>You have no son. You never did.</i>

Six years since he'd walked out their front door. He'd managed to bury his feelings, thinking that'd it do no good to rage against what was.

<i>I have no son. I never did.</i>

He loved Mimi's family--no, <i>his</i> family. For they were his family in every way that mattered. And Papa had already agreed to escort Angel during his wedding without questions or complaints. The weight of the rings on his left hand were tangible proof of Collins' fierce love--not that he needed the proof. He simply <i>knew</i>.

And it wasn't that he was upset they wouldn't remember him. He'd rather that be the case, and he was glad Faith took the decision out of his hands. He'd been frozen--unable to comprehend what his mother was saying--Collins' hands his only anchors at that moment. 

But there was a sixteen year old confused adolescent within him, one that cried out and begged for his parents to love him.

When the tears began flowing down his cheeks, he didn't fight them.

Gentle hands reached up, wiping the tears from his face. ""Let it out, baby,"" Collins whispered, holding him close. ""Let it out--they can't hurt you no more--I love you--I'll never leave you--<i>let it out....</i>""

Curled up in the arms of the man he loved, Angel, the sixteen year old, the twenty-three year old, cried."

Angel didn't remember who had made that observation, but he was certainly finding it to be true. Exams once again--midterms were swiftly approaching and he didn't want to fall behind--and it seemed all of his classmates saw him as the right person to ask about extraneous details and assignments they had missed.

He could have asked to be left alone, but he couldn't turn away someone else in need. That was a life-long habit, and had certainly served him well in terms of his current situation.

Feeling the weight of the ring on his left hand, he smiled. After answering the last inquiries, he headed out of the classroom, deciding that it was late enough to give Collins a visit in his office.

""I'd heard you were taking classes here, but I did not know whether or not to believe it.""

His mother's voice, familiar and strained, broke into his thoughts, freezing him in his tracks. He turned, keeping his face blank.

""How did you find me?""

""One of the people who handled your petition to change your name was a family friend--one you hadn't seen since you were very small.""

""It seems confidentiality documentation means nothing,"" he said flatly, still keeping his voice controlled. ""What do you want?""

She hesitated, wringing her hands. ""We--your father and I--would like you to come home.""

""No."" The word was soft, but seemed to echo in the hall. ""I already have a home. And he's waiting for me.""

He started down the hall and paused again before the elevators. ""I don't want to see you again.""

""I deserve that,"" his mother said softly, sadness in her voice. ""I...I had hoped--""

""So did I. And though my faith in you and him proved misplaced, my hope has never failed me.""

Not looking in her direction, he boarded the elevator.

She did not follow."

"event","Angel woke up one morning, feeling languid. Turning his head, he saw that his lover still slept on, a faint smile on his face. Angel didn't often have an opportunity to study him without Collins noticing, and he hungrily drank in the sight of the other man. No matter how long he lived, he would never grow tired of seeing that hint of happiness on his face, the faint scar on his left cheek, the laugh lines around his eyes and mouth.

Collins was beautiful and his, and to hell with what the rest of the world would say.

Angel slowly stretched, the blanket slipping down off of his body. His movement caused Collins to murmur in his sleep and shift.

When Angel smiled, it was for an entirely different reason. Collins had proven he could sleep through almost anything.

He lightly trailed his fingers down the sturdy chest before him, the tips gently brushing over his nipples. He followed the same trail with his lips, blessing the skin before him. So warm, musky, solid. <i>Him.</i>

Pushing the blanket off further, he was pleased with the very visible results of his actions. A quick glance up assured him that his lover slept on.

He licked one hand and slowly stroked the rapidly thickening flesh, lowering his head to lick up the pearly drops on the head. Another glance up showed Collins giving signs of approaching wakefulness.

He blew warm air softly on his skin, licking up and down the shaft. Collins moaned softly, deep in his throat, his eyes still closed.

Angel grinned again before taking him fully into his mouth, head bobbing up and down rhythmically, as though he were following the beating of drums.

""...damn, baby,"" Collins groaned weakly, his eyes opening.

Angel did not answer with words, continuing his actions and using a free hand to fondle his heavy balls. With a full-throated groan, Collins came down his throat, his legs trembling and his skin flushing.

When the last of his tremors subsided, Angel moved up his body, stradling his waist and kissing him deeply. Collins sucked his tongue into his mouth, scouring the taste of himself out of Angel's.

""Good morning, honey,"" Angel whispered."

Angel nodded, setting a wrapped bundle of fabric on the couch. ""I promised to go by more, and she needs to know there will be company for Christmas. Want to come with me and meet her?""

Collins glanced up again, this time startled. ""Baby, she doesn't know about me yet.""

He rubbed his body against Collins in the darkness of the club. It was one he hadn't been to in years and out of drag, no one recognized him there. 

The beat was steady, hard, hypnotic and vibrant and his body followed suit, giving into a purely primal form of worship and exhuberance. 

Collins redefined grace for him, twining around him the way a vine would a branch, never losing sight or touch of him. His hands brushed his leg and Angel trembled, feeling suddenly weak. How one person could illicit that sort of response was still beyond comprehension.

They danced until the song finally slowed and Angel took Collins by the hand, tugging him towards the club's entrance.

""Angel.""

The voice made him stiffen and stop. Collins turned with him to look at the speaker.

""You must be Ricky,"" Collins said flatly, looking over the other man.

Like Angel had told him that first night, Ricky was beautiful. And his eyes were empty.

""This your new fucktoy?"" he sneered, not noticing the other man's hands clenching. He did, however, notice the arm against his windpipe and being slammed into the wall.

""No,"" Collins said, his voice low and dark. ""I'm his lover. And I'd <i>better</i> not hear another word come outta your filthy mouth.""

He let go, watching him slump against the wall. Angel took his hand once again and they left.

""Collins..."" Angel whispered.

""M'sorry if I frightened you, baby. But I couldn't let him say...""

""You didn't frighten me."" Heedless of the people milling around them, Angel kissed Collins firmly, deep. ""I know a place--I want to dance again.""

He wore a bright red windbreaker, green turtleneck, and white miniskirt with his tights and heels. Judging by the appreciative looks he was getting from gay and straight men alike, the image worked.

""...I told you we didn't need to get off on this street, Rosalita. Now where are we?""

He paused on his way into a store, hair prickling at the back of his neck.

<i>Get out of my house, queer!</i>

""<i>Lo siento</i>, Manuel. I think we're on 12th street.""

<i>Mama, please...</i>

<i>I have no son. My son is dead. Get out!</i>

""You missed twelfth street, actually,"" he said in a surprisingly steady voice. His father's hair had grey at the temples and his mother had wrinkles on her forehead. 

They turned to look at him and did not recognize him. Not surprising--he hadn't started wearing drag until after he had been thrown out of the house. 

<i>Ricardo, you can come to us with anything. Any problem.</i>

Except the little problem of his homosexuality. That did not fall under the umbrella of anything. When he left the house, he left their name behind. Angel had been chosen on a whim--he had always loved angels during Christmas services.

""We did? Can you tell us how to get here?"" His father indicated a spot on a poorly drawn map. Angel recognized the location. ""You'll want to get back on the subway and get off at this junction.""

His mother nodded, studying his directions. ""I thought so, <i>muchas gracias</i>. What is your name?""

""My name isn't important,"" he said stiffly. ""Glad I could help."" 

Turning to walk always, he was surprised when his father put a hand on his shoulder. ""<i>Perdon</i>, do we know you?""

He shook his father's hand away from him, walking to the crossing.

""No, you don't. I'm dead to you, remember?""

His mother gasped. ""<i>Ricardo</i>?""

<i>My parents disowned me for being queer, chica.

Screw your parents. Come home and meet my mama. She will love you.</i>

""We...we didn't expect...""

""Neither did I."" His words were clipped. ""You know where you're going.""

""What...how....can we find you?"" His father's words surprised him.

""I'm surprised you wish to speak to your little queer.""

""Don't you talk that way to us!"" his father shouted at him. ""We're not the ones who...who shame God with such depravity.""

""Turning your own flesh and blood out onto the streets makes God smile? He's not a god worth knowing in my eyes,"" he spat back, feeling the old pain transform into justified anger. ""<i>Adios, mama y papa.</i> I honestly hope I do not see you again.""

Picking his moment, he ran out among the traffic, getting himself expertly lost in the confusion."

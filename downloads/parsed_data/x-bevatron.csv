That pastime is drinking very large amounts of wine and mocking the <a href=""http://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/93616405.html"">national costumes portion of the Miss Universe pageant</a>.

I hope that the rumors are true, and that the rainbow-looking color scheme is a direct response to Russia's backwards anti-gay policies.  I will still not be watching any of the Sochi Olympics, and encouraging others to do the same.  The only language that too many powerful people understand is lost revenue, in this case advertisements on the television broadcasts.

I will probably also not watch any of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar for similar reasons (in that case human rights abuses in the construction of the infrastructure for the event), but that is a bit farther off..."

Life has been complicated, as it often is. I think I make it harder than it needs to be. My procrastination and subtle fear of the unknown tend to get in the way. I swear, I'm a walking contradiction. I love taking chances, trying new things, but I can't seem to do such things in the appropriate areas. 

I feel like my friend circle has greatly fluctuated. I still have my bestie, and the miscellaneous people that I often talk to -- and of course, coworkers. But...I want to feel <i>closer</i> to more people. I want to take pride and comfort in those around me. 

I need to get out more. For the last couple months, I've been stuck in a bit of a rut. I stopped working out, I don't go out nearly as much, and I feel more and more like this mess that will never be anything but. I want to clean out my life; strip it down to the bare essentials, find out what is important to me, and build off of that. I want to nurture and progress in my goals and skills. I want to do more, see more, live more. I feel like I'm getting swept up in the dull and mundane. There's so much more to life than that shitty job you need for the money or the brain dead numb that comforts you as you stare at the TV, just to make the time pass. 

I need to make a list. Something I can look at everyday. Something to remind me of what I want out of life. I don't want my youth to pass me by."

I try to play it off, even in my head.  
I just want to be shown interest.
I like to call it my Leo fault. It's the need for constant adoration and attention, which is probably why I often have more than one interest at a time. Mind you, when I say interest, it does not mean I'm sleeping with multiple people. It simply means that I'm a flirt and I like to see where each day is going to take me. 

Most of the time I like people and making new friends. I love making first impressions, for I think I'm fantastic at them. And secretly (or not so secretly) I'm looking for that spark, that chemistry with someone. 

It is said that good things come to those who wait. I just feel like I've been waiting for years; waiting for something to come through. I've been distracted in good and bad ways, yes, but I have not found the real thing yet. Well, I don't know if I should say that. I've had the real thing. I know what it's like to be in love.  But when looking back at the situation, I always wonder if it was all in my head. I was so blindly in love. He made it so easy. I just didn't know the truth behind it all. He hid so much from me.

C'est Danielle.

Although I am not fond of certain habits, I am growing more and more fond of this Aquarius and his personality. I am definitely less attached than I normally am to people I have interest in. I think it's somehow safer this way. It comes off as much more casual. Other distractions tend to veer my mind places anyhow. But there is something very familiar and wonderful when I am with him. It's being able to crack jokes, to make mistakes, for things to be a little messy. It's being able to incorporate that playfulness into what feels like the start of something good. Even if it were not to progress, I would appreciate and bask in the good feelings I am left with. All in all, it's refreshing. It's perfect for summer.

Lately I have been feeling completely alienated from those I have had a strong friendships with. There are two people in particular that I have hung out with for the first time in a couple months, only to find that they are significantly different from what I remember. I suppose these two people have had a couple of lifestyle alternating experiences, but I never thought it would change their behaviors around me. Very odd indeed. 

I have also noticed within myself that I am growing up. I am not jumping quite so blindly into every situation that presents itself; this is a good thing. It makes for less regret and internal struggling.  I swear, people are testing my limits though; pulling me from one extreme to another. I don't think I've ever trusted myself quite so much.

I was also reminded of my hypocrisy, so I had no real right to be upset in the first place. None the less, I ran with it, and I think I got it all out of my system. Thanks to the features of Facebook, I won't have to look at his daily posts. Mind you, they are as cryptic as mine most of the time, but I won't have to look at his profile page and be constantly reminded of his dickery. I like this. Before, there was no real reason to glance at it either way. I did or I didn't. I could, but I wouldn't. I would, but I didn't find anything. Now at least I have a reason to forget altogether. And it feels good. In this knowledge, I am no longer stuck in the purgatory of not knowing. God, it feels amazing. Refreshing.

I was asked out by a very interesting fellow. He has had an amazing life, and I loved listening to his stories and about things he has accomplished and the way he grew up; it's all very impressive. The thing is, he has this major attraction to me (he tells me so), and I am left feeling unsure. I just don't know if I'm attracted to him. He's not too much older than I, but I don't think I'm mature enough for him. I appreciate his maturity, but I think ultimately, I have a lot more growing up to do before I can be with someone like him. Hell, I might never be that mature. Perhaps our ideas of fun are just considerably different. Don't get me wrong - it was a great date! A jaunt around Bodega Bay, a very nice dinner, and taffy and wine to top it all off, but my mind and my body were slightly uncomfortable. At the end of the day, I ended up being tense and awkward, which is very unlike me. I refused a kiss, and glanced awkwardly around. I don't want it to be an omen, but perhaps my senses are telling me something. I tend to ignore my instincts and do as I please anyway. But look at where it's gotten me: not much of anywhere. Perhaps now that area number one (see first paragraphs) is clear, I'll be more in the moment and laid back. I think it's about time I started listening to my intuitions. I'm just going to play it by ear."

No one hangs on every word you utter. Life is what you make of it, and you have the worse attitude towards it I have ever witnessed. I am just so relieved that I don't have to deal with your high school drama and your mind games. You are trapped there. You will never take advantage of me again.

Running 12 minutes:

After: 5 laps

Crunches for 1.5 minutes:

Push-ups for 1.5 minutes (real ones on my toes):

I admire and appreciate it. I actually prefer it. 
So why, from the two men that have seriously told me they want a future (or just something long term) with me, have I totally freaked out about? I mean, I can say for the first that I was always hesitant. For roughly 4 years or so, this gentlemen was telling me he was going to marry me and we were going to make babies, etc, etc. I always played it off in my mind and smiled politely. Then sometime around February, I said ""fuck it."" I let myself fall. I went against my intuition and let myself get emotionally involved only to be let down a few months later. I was amazed that after literally YEARS it was all over in a matter of months. I hate to say it, but I felt lied to and betrayed. Most of all I was mad at myself for throwing caution into the wind and for not listening to what I knew to be true. 

The other gentleman is obviously recent. There hasn't been full out proposals and commitments, but there has been mention. I always take it as a joke. I think I joke a lot about things that make me uncomfortable. Just a automatic defense I suppose. I think the idea is sweet. The romantic girly girl in the back of my mind dreams and fantasizes of what it would be like. But I think that's just it, fiction. The part of me that longs for it is the part that is only in it for the new experience. For the thrill, the excitement, not the solid fact of being with someone for possibly the rest of my life. I get so suspicious. Based especially on the number of people I know this boy has been with, who is to say that he hasn't said these things to every single person before me? When I asked why me, why now, and why the interest, among the various responses, I got one that consisted of this being the right time and place. That he hadn't been ready for a while. While I admire this, it also makes me wonder. Seeing as how I'm the first person he is committing to seriously in a while, am I a security blanket? And so fast! It's been literally a month!! Am I here just to be here? Am I what I am simply because I am willing and available? There's actually quite a bit more to this situation I'm not going to write now though. Perhaps at a later date when I'm feeling more honest and ballsie. 

Am I forever going to be plagued with doubt? Every single time I get into a relationship, I bitch, moan, complain....find SOMETHING wrong! Don't get me wrong, it's never all bad. I have fond memories of almost all my partnerships. I never say anything because I don't want to cause unnecessary fighting. I don't want to be THAT person, you know? 

I keep going back and forth in my mind. I'm scared. Half of me feels like looking for that certain someone. That person that I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. The person I can raise kids with, grow old with, adventure with. The other half of me says to wait, that I have time. And I know I do. I'm not in any real rush. There's so much I want to accomplish before I alter my life forever and make babies! But then I hear horror stories. Of bodies failing, complications as the years go on. There's so much that could go wrong. I guess the best bet is to find a healthy medium. One life, one chance. I'm sure I'll know when I feel ready. 

But really, I gotta start listening to my intuitions. They're usually right."

So, right after work yesterday I acquired some disappointing news that at that instant made me quite dramatic and angsty. Luckily I got to hang out with Lauren, Connor, and Nick which totally perked up my night. I also got to see Max for a few minutes - drunk I'm sure - but Max time none the less. The fireworks were awesome as always. The ride home through all the traffic was quite enjoyable! We blasted 80's music that we could sing along to with all the windows rolled down. <3

Anyway, my eye has been sporadically twitching the last two days. Mom says it's the lack of sleep. Others tell me I'm stressed. Stressed about what? And I get plenty of sleep! Who knows...

I think the only reason I do is because you are what my mind currently identifies with. You are simply embodying what I desire. It does not have anything to do with you in actuality. 

On that note. I would love to be in a relationship. 
Unfortunately, I am not a patient person. 
I long for intimate companionship.
Someone I can go and do things with as well as smother in PDA.

Don't remember everything we said to each other, but he was very sweet after initially making fun of me. :-P

"event","I'm not having a recurring dream, but I am definitely dreaming about some of the same people almost every night. This is weird for me. I never even considered myself that dream oriented. And I can't find my dream book. Lame. I would love to look up what some of these things mean. 

So, this dream, I was walking around a park with a little dog. It was a big park, and all the grass and leaves on the trees were green. The walk goes on and night was approaching, so I start trying to retrace my steps. I come to a 4-way cross road. I look in all directions, and each direction looks the same. I keep looking at each direction, hoping one will change even slightly. I think one does, so I start walking that way. I pass a few street lights and curved curbs surrounded by bushes and residential like sidewalks. I don't really remember passing people, but I may have, because at some point, I get the feeling that I am being followed. I go back into the park area which has become more and more wilderness like until I come to a small shed. For some reason, I recognize this shed and go inside, locking the door behind me, as I can see through the side panels that a man had been following me, and tries to come into the shed. The next few thoughts are a little blurry, but I remember the man outside being arrested and taken away. So, now I'm in this shed. It looks like a kind of kid's cabin. It has the Harry Potter thing going on (it looks really small from the outside, but is actually large on the inside). It has a very warm feel on the inside. The walls are painted a warm maroon color, and there are bunk beds made of pine. Miscellaneous strings of lights, pictures, and hangings are all over, giving the place a very homey feel. Somehow various people from the group spawn, and are conversing and laying in the bunk beds. Now it gets a little confusing. I remember seeing and talking with a potential love interest (perhaps more), and suddenly parts of one of the walls come down. The shed collapses, but we are all left within an even bigger cabin/house which apparently belonged to a man we were renting the shed from. The house we are in also has a warm house feel, but larger, and with deep sea green foam walls and lots of books. We all see the man, apologize, and start to reconstruct the shed within the house again. From there on, I can't remember much else. But I mean, really, what kind of dream is that? Weird. 

The other thing - when I dream of this potential love interest (and I have been recently dreaming of him almost every night. It makes me feel like a dream stalker!), it seems in almost every dream, something goes wrong. I can't decide if something is wrong, and I am being saved or because I am in the company of this person, I am doomed - meaning that it would never work between us. Who knows."

It consisted of one of the dishwashers from work inserting a needle into my wrist to test for Pneumonia. I was all freaked out because I was thinking ""Uh, does she know what she's doing?"" Anyway...
Then it panned to being at some sort of sporting event, and seeing a certain gentleman that has been buggin' me to hang out recently. I don't really remember there being a specific plot to this dream, but it was so bizarre. And when I woke up, the arm that had been stuck with a needle was completely asleep.

I guess the last few days in general I have been having very vivid and random dreams. The night before I dreamed about seeing all these beautiful landscapes from very swanky apartment windows, and being lost within very nice college dorms to then running around a large commercial shopping mall. If this is my mind trying to work things out, it's sure going about it in an odd way. 

...

I miss being in love. I miss the feeling of having someone whose every hug, touch, and kiss are special. That they actually mean something. That they are not just for the sake of doing them. That they have genuine emotion and purpose behind them. I am glad, however, that I don't feel lost or hopeless as I usually do. I just feel kinda blank about it. I do wish I had some prospects.

I've never even had to think about it in the past. It was always established. It just feels really vague. I simply say that we are dating. Although, he has said in the past that he needs to know that the person he is dating is exclusive. Mind you he didn't specifically say ME. But how serious is serious? 

The other side, is he is easily scared off. He misinterpreted something I had said during a conversation and apparently thought I was implying long term commitment. I said no such thing, but he was weirded out none the less. It's hard to gage. 

I am certainly not a dependent person, I have plenty of things to do to entertain me throughout my days. But, if I don't see or talk to someone that I am interested in within a few days, I lose interest. And don't get me wrong, I'm all for texting and such, but when it's no more than a few friendly exchanges, I find myself getting bored and losing interest. Sad? I don't need someone to be obsessed with me either, I just want to know that special someone is at least thinking about me. Maybe he just needs to let his guard down?

The other thing - I don't know how much you Petalumians would like him. I can't see him really fitting into the whole geek-squad-death-skating-crazy-drunken crowd. Not sure I like that either. 

So I guess for both our sakes, and my sanity, we are dating. Nothing more.

"event","<b>So, my friend Juli posted this via Facebook, but I liked it and thought I would share. Please feel free to write your own thoughts.</b>

<lj-cut text=""Market Morality"">

<i>So is it more virtuous to sell your body or your mind?

Our culture would have us sell both.

Any job that you perform (no matter how mundane, or physically in exerting) requires that you think and act for your employer and your employer pays you for your services. there are varying scales of actions and pay for example: a construction worker sells his body- his job is almost entirely physical ; whereas a computer programmer sells his mind and ability to his employer.

which one of these extremes is assigned the higher monetary value? the computer programmer.
in a society that supposedly rewards virtue monetarily (we are ""capitalist"") the ""winner"" in the scenario is that man who sells his brain, not the man who sells his body.
so if money is the test of virtue and selling one's brain fetches a higher price than one's body, then in our society it is more virtuous to sell your mind then your body. 

We also know this because of the negative connotation that sometimes comes with more physical jobs- for instance being a prostitute or a coal miner is not seen by society as honorable or respectable; whereas being an intellectual, a ""rocket-scientist"" shall we say is looked upon with humble respect.

Let us momentarily pause on that line of reasoning to clear something else up.

Where do you believe your ""being"" or ""essence"" exists?

Do you believe that your limbs control your thoughts and actions, that your toe falls in love with the girl in your pe class?

Or do you believe that your brain judges the world that it sees and interprets and that ""YOU"" exist in your head- you live in a nest of neurons? That you think and feel with the organ of your body that is capable of processing information?

You believe that ""YOU"" reside in your brain, don't you?

So back to the original argument, with an added twist. Now based on the fact that ""YOU"" exist in your brain, do you still find it more virtuous to sell your brain than your body? Are you still willing to accept minimum wage as an acceptable price when you sell not only your ability to reason, but in fact ""YOURSELF"" on the open market?

When one sells his body what is he really selling? Not the concept of ""HIMSELF"" just the container. He is selling muscle and fiber, not thinking and emotion.
When a whore rents her body, does the john ever touch her concept of ""SELF?"" NO! he touches her body. (though psychologically speaking she may bring him into her concept of self).
Are you not selling more of yourself when your brain is involved than when it is merely physical labor?

So back to the original question: which is more virtuous; selling you mind or body?

When you sell your brain, the work comes from ""YOU"" you have to think about it, feel it and create it. The work becomes a part of ""YOU,"" and whatever your salary is, is the price that you have accepted for selling yourself. Is it worth it?

When you sell your body, it is merely a physical investment. You remove rocks from a quarry- you build a house- whatever it is that you do. You are still left your mind. You perform a physical task and then you go home. You are not invested in that task beyond what you can lift. 

So which is better, selling the essence of yourself; or selling the vessel that carries that ego?</i>


Then, this was my response:

I liked this line:
""Do you believe that your limbs control your thoughts and actions, that your toe falls in love with the girl in your pe class?""

My toes are total players. They fall in love with boys all the time, this is why I must wear more socks. 

My body and my mind are the greatest instruments that I will ever own. Those, and maybe my camera. But it makes me think, with your argument of selling either, don't we kind of do both outside of our job? 

Our minds we often sell to unworthy people. They don't gain anything monetary, but they do get some of our memories. Sometimes unknowlingly we let people plague our heads and thoughts. Where is the buffer?

Our bodies we often sell to society. We dress a certain way, more or less conforming to fashion over function. We also sell our bodies to food companies. There are so many foods we won't ever need, but in the search for nourishment, we turn to taste palet pleasers. It's like: Please fill me up!

I'm sure I could have written more, but you get the jist. Enjoy!"

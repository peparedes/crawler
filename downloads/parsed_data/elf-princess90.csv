"event","All I can say is ... thank God for adrenaline! <br /><br />This weekend we went to visit&nbsp;CSI for a fundraiser coffee house (a missionary couple in the church are going to live in Mexico). It was sweet to see my cousins, but we ended up not going to bed until 4:30am on Saturday night :S We were playing the best board game EVER, Atmosfear :D. <br /><br />So today I'm walking around in a daze, and it just gets better when I remember that PAL is my first class. Haha, and then Sweet Lady Adrenaline kicks in, and suddenly, I'm running ... RUNNING. And playing handball defense well enough that the guys actually noticed me and said, ""Hey, you're getting a lot of passes!""&nbsp;Oh man ... I was so crazed. Then when class was over, and there was no immediate need for energy, I came down from my adrenaline buzz, and could hardly walk, of course. hahah.&nbsp; <br /><br />Math test tomorrow :S I'm really worried about it. I know the formulas, but when I look at a random triangle I can't sort out which steps to use and when. I really really want to do well, but we'll see! <br /><br />About the one thing that made this day at all good was the fact that April Crocker was NOT in class today!! That's two classes that were a whole lot better because she was missing. It all seemed strange, and then it's like ""Oh, April's not here! That's why it's so pleasant!"" haha. <br /><br />I also found the best song ever! My page title is taken from the lyrics :) It's called ""The Spirit Carries On"" by Dream Theater. Enjoy ^_^ <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1tn4XXGrTU"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1tn4XXGrTU</a><br /><br />Now, all of you know you want to visit my pretty pretty Piczo, which I've just spent a crapload of time reworking! So be grateful!! <a href=""http://www.pointcounterpoint.piczo.com"">http://www.pointcounterpoint.piczo.com</a>"

"event","<p><font size=""2"">Second semester's started ... and it basically sucks. My courses are:<br /><br />Math - which I tend to get quite lost in<br />PAL - hate, physical exertion, hate<br />Accounting - a class so loud I can't hear myself scream, let alone think. God Forbid I should try to work!<br /><br />On the bright side, I do have a Free, which is awesome :D I loooove it because I can use the time to make sense of my math, and just calm down for awhile ... I think it's about the only thing keeping me from smacking a few choice people 10 times a day.<br /><br />Today we got report cards from first semester!! My marks were:<br /><br />Advanced English ; 92%<br />(Shakespeare killed me: 90 the term we do Romeo &amp; Juliet, 95 the term we don't. Coincidence? I think not!)<br /><br />Dance ; 93%<br />(Oh how I hated that woman. This mark proves the power of positive sucking up ;)<br /><br />Canadian History ; 94%<br />(Mrs. Whittleton!! I miss you so much, *cries + salutes* Long Live the Prime Ministeress)<br /><br />Biology ; 95%<br />(Ohhhhh, Mrs. Cobb, I miss you so too! *hug*&nbsp;Such an amazing teacher, I'm glad I made her proud)<br /><br />Well, that's it for now. More later as the news unfolds ^_^<br />-- Beth &lt;3</font></p>"

"event","<font size=""2"">Ok, so first entry in my new journal ... I'm hoping starting fresh will make me more committed.<br /><br />(And it looks prettier now :P)<br /><br />So -- first day back at school after Christmas break :S Blah. Actually though, it was a&nbsp;surprisingly good day. Mrs. Whittleton moved our history test to tomorrow. She said she was playing Santa Claus. I think she may be trying to do too much, being Santa, a teacher and, of course, the Prime Minister of Heaven (Nikki!).<br /><br />Started our bio invertabrate project today ... with Nikki again *we'll be sick of each other soon!*. We're doing a pretty, but somewhat scary, jumping spider (it was staring at me ... always staring ...).&nbsp;<br /><br />Anyway, that's all for now, I guess. If you want to see my other sites, they're <a href=""http://www.pointcounterpoint.piczo.com"">http://www.pointcounterpoint.piczo.com</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""http://whitewashed-lies.deviantart.com"">http://whitewashed-lies.deviantart.com</a> .&nbsp;<br /><br />Bye !<br /><br />- Beth &lt;3</font>"

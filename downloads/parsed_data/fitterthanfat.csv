"event","I really suck at losing weight.  I try to blame it on the people around me -- I live with three people who don't seem to care about their weight or health, so there is always junk food in my house, and my boyfriend has a wicked sweet tooth, so he always wants to get desserts when we go out to eat together -- but I really know it's my own weakness that is to blame.  The most frustrating part to me is that I KNOW what to do.  I swear, I've spent so much of my life hating my body and wanting to lose weight and reading everything I can find that I probably know everything there is to know about how to lose weight.  The only thing I can't figure out is how to just DO IT.  Stop obsessing over it and just get it done!

My lifestyle is mostly healthy.  I've been wearing a pedometer every day for over a month, and I have very little problem getting over 10,000 steps per day.  It's not even that much of a stretch to have 15,000 or 20,000.  I walk, jog, and go to the gym regularly.  I know I need to spend more time on strength and flexibility, but I don't completely ignore those aspects of fitness.  I keep my fiber intake high, I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, I choose fish and poultry over red meat virtually every time I eat meat.  But then... I eat candy and potato chips.  I drink soda.  I order dessert.  And I keep getting fatter.

I've even identified what triggers me to crave junk food and over eat.  Usually it's boredom, so I've filled my life.  Mondays I go to the gym and don't get home until 7.  Tuesdays I walk/jog with my sister and don't get home until 11, if I ever go home at all that night.  Wednesdays I go to the gym then to Darryl's apartment, and don't get home until 9 or 10.  Thursdays I walk with my other sister and get home after 9.  Fridays I go to the gym then to Darryl's again to spend the night.  So I don't really have time to sit around my house eating snacks, but I keep finding the time and making the time.  It's ridiculous!

I weighed myself this morning and I'm at 161.6.  That's only 3.4 pounds away from obesity (I'm 5'2"").  Only 3 pairs of my work pants fit me anymore, and 1 of them is pretty tight.  Too tight to get my foot up to tie my shoes, so I just wear slip-ons.  I can't believe I'm living this way.  It makes me want to run as hard as I can until my lungs ache and I'm coughing from over-exertion.  But I don't do that.  Instead, I give in to pumpkin cream cheese muffins at Starbucks, and mini Butterfingers at home, and cookies at my mom and dad's house.

You're sick of me whining, aren't you?  So am I."

"event","Darryl and I have been going back and forth about an issue since Friday, and yesterday it escalated into a fight.  At this point, I don't see any possible resolution that will make either of us happy.  I don't even feel like I can talk to anyone about it either.  I don't want to talk to my family about it, because I don't want them to see him in a bad light.  I don't need them telling me I'm better of without him or anything like that.  I don't have any friends who are close enough that I would feel comfortable talking to them about relationship problems.  Maybe I also don't want to talk to anyone about it because I won't be able to handle someone telling me I'm wrong.  I FIRMLY believe I am right, but I know that a lot of people have very different beliefs than I do.  And just for the record, I'm basing my beliefs on the results of numerous clinical studies, so it's not like I'm being irrational -- which Darryl keeps saying.  GOD, that pisses me off as much as anything.  I know sometimes I am emotional, but this particular belief is based on proven fact as much as my own feelings.

So I was in a pretty awful place all night, and still this morning.  And then, within an hour of getting to work, I got an email from the department head in New York.  She was trying to blame me and another coworker responsible for our coworker's poor attendance and irresponsibility.  I have to fax the attendance sheet to the NY office every day, but that does not mean I control who comes in when, or why they take days off, or if they communicate with the rest of the department.  It sure doesn't help that our boss here in Seattle has been away from the office for TWO MONTHS.  Maybe if we actually had a boss to answer to every day people wouldn't feel like they could be so irresponsible.  This place is ridiculous.  I want to go home."

"event","I'm such a dumbass sometimes...


Anyway, I just realized that there is a Bally gym only a ten minute bus ride away from Darryl's apartment!  I AM SO EXCITED!  I almost never work out on weekends 'cause it takes too long to get to the gym, and I don't like running in his area (and I'm just really, really lazy).  So this is a huge boost for me today.

This gym will probably be nicer than my usual gym too, 'cause the one I frequent has... uh... well, I'll just say that there are signs on the road that warn drivers that they are under video surveilance due to high drug and prostitution activity in that area.  And he lives in the Microsoft city, which means more people have money and the crime rate is way lower.  So, yeah, it'll be a nicer gym.

I just wish I had realized it was there sooner!  I could have solved two problems with one stone: 1) never working out on weekends and 2) waking up hours before he does and being bored out of my mind.  

Last night I was looking at a calendar and realized I only have 20 weeks until Christmas.  Yikes.  I need to lose 1-1.5 pounds per week in order to lose the weight I want to lose by then.  That means I need to <b>stop screwing around and get serious.</b>  Adding weekend workouts will help that.  Ooo!  I keep thinking of things that make this whole deal even better.  Darryl keeps saying he wants to work out with me, but he never does it.  Perhaps now that I will be working out during our time together, he'll get off his butt and come with.  I won't keep my hopes up on that one though  :-P"

"event","I caught myself thinking of myself (please allow myself to introduce.... myself) as Darryl's ""fat girlfriend.""  When I was growing up, my mom always called herself my ""fat mama.""  Girls always seem to grow up fearing that they will someday turn into their mother.  I know I did.  And I see myself becoming more and more like her every day.  I inherited her annoyance with people leaving dishes in the sink instead of putting them in the dishwasher; her ""obsessed with X right now, forget about it next week"" mentality; her penchant for homemade crafts (decorations, cards, gifts, etc.); and, it appears, her life-long struggle with her weight, as well as her life-long struggle for self-acceptance.  However, I haven't developed her distaste for any and all clutter; her need for organized religion; her hatred for tattoos and piercings; or her extremely conservative viewpoints.  So, being optimistic here, I don't have to be just like her in every way.  I don't have to fight my own body for the rest of my life like she has.  

What I know I need to work on now is my self-identification.  I need to stop thinking of myself as ""fat Megan"" and start thinking of myself as ""healthy Megan.""  Happy Megan.  Athletic, active, confident, capable Megan.  I know that's what I need to work on.  But how do I do that?"

"event","I don't know if thinking this way is stopping me from losing any weight, but I realized this morning that I don't believe I can do it.  Even if I can lose the weight I want to lose, I don't believe I will keep it off.  From the time I was a child, I watched my mom diet constantly, and watched her weight go up and down.  She never got to a healthy weight, and she was never happy.  I assume I will be the same way.  

I feel so bad for Darryl.  We're going to get married, and then he's going to have to put up with my crazy weight battle for the rest of his life.  He's always going to have to listen to me complain about my fat butt and wish that I could do something about it, while continuing to eat fried foods, sweets, cream-based sauces, etc.

It doesn't have to be this way, and I know that.  Other people can lose weight and keep it off for the rest of their life.  Why not me?  I know it's possible, rationally.  It's my irrational mind that I have to convince now.

"event","Last night was a little bit ridiculous.  On my way home from the gym, I was planning what I wanted to have for dinner.  One slice of frozen cheese pizza and a big salad with balsamic vinegar.  I got home and looked at the nutritional info for the pizza, and it was perfect.  290 calories per slice, if each slice was 1/5 of the pizza.  I cooked it up, and carefully cut it into fifths.  Unfortunately, I felt too lazy to make the salad, even though I had a bag of pre-cut, pre-washed lettuce.  That's pretty damn lazy.
I ate my one slice of pizza, then decided I wanted more.  By the time I got to the stove where the rest of the pizza was sitting, I knew I didn't actually want more.  As I grabbed my second piece, I felt almost nauseated thinking about eating it.  I was already full, I didn't need it.  But I still took it.  Every bite I took was unpleasant, but I ate it all anyway.  WHY??  Why did I do that?  I ate the entire piece of pizza, all the while thinking about how much I <i>didn't</i> want to eat it.  
I've never thought of myself as being out of control when it comes to eating.  I always thought my problem was just that I wanted to eat too much, not that I couldn't stop when I should have.  After last night, I'm not so sure.  I don't know why I ate as much as I did.  I don't know what I was trying to accomplish.  I guess that's why I'm writing here today.  I want to work on figuring out WHY I eat the way I do.  Maybe when I figure that out I'll actually be able to lose this weight."

"event","My muscles are sore, but not as sore as I had hoped they would be.  I barely feel like I worked out at all.  Maybe my muscles are used to it... or maybe I didn't work out hard enough last night.  I'll push myself harder next time.

Today there was a bake sale in the lunch room at work.  Tons of cookies and brownies and muffins and other random horrible foods.  It's a good thing I'm so broke -- I couldn't afford to buy anything.  But there were free donuts in the building lobby, and I didn't take any, so I guess I was being good today.

Skipped breakfast (bad!!), had tomato soup and an apple for lunch.  Probably a lean cuisine and some brocolli for dinner.  I need to go to the store and get more fruits and vegetables... ate my last apple today!"

"event","Weekends are so horrible.  I don't drink water, I just drink juice and soda.  I've been trying to drink more iced tea instead of mango lassis and sodas when I go out to eat, but water would still be better.  
Also horrible: I only eat two meals a day, and both of those meals are usually crap.  This weekend I had Chinese food (chicken with vegetables in spicy sauce, so not TOO bad) Friday night, Indian buffet and Bangers and mash on Saturday, then Mexican food and Italian food on Sunday.  BLEH.  Nothing but garbage.  Delicious garbage, but garbage just the same.

I also feel bad 'cause I nagged Darryl about his eating habits too much this weekend.  In my defense, he eats a double cheeseburger for lunch every day, and two hot dogs for dinner every night.  Disgusting!  He doesn't have any breakfast, and eats nothing but processed, greasy, fatty, sodium-filled foods.  And then there's the Pepsi... he drinks at least three cans per day, and I suspect that it's actually usually more than that.  I am just concerned for his health, and he knows that, but I still feel like a jerk for nagging him about it.

Next weekend Darryl is coming to my house for the weekend instead of me going to his place, so perhaps I can cook something healthier.  And we can go down to the Farmer's Market on Saturday and pick out some nice vegetables.  He mentioned a desire to start working out a bit, and said he would like to start playing tennis.  That would be great for both of us... I'll have to make sure we do that.

In a slightly more positive vein, Gail and Travis both said I was looking thin last night.  Yay!  Even if I'm not actually losing weight, it makes me happy to know that it appears to others that I am.  And really, maybe I am... I haven't weighed myself in a while.  I want to hold off on that for the time being.

I WILL go for a jog this afternoon.  No more ""I hope to go.""  That isn't working.  I MUST go.  And I MUST do my strength training as well.  I'm going to take the PS2 into my room so I can do my pilates dvd.  and tomorrow I WILL be sore.

I guess that's all for now.  Here's hoping for a great day and an amazing week!"

"event","Current Weight: 153
ST Goal: 120
LT Goal: I don't know.  I'm honestly more concerned with being healthy than being a certain weight.  I'm going to listen to my body and let myself find a natural, healthy weight.
Why this is important to me: I want to be able to participate in physical activities (hiking, biking, jogging, playing tennis, swimming, etc) without being more focused on feeling inadequate than on enjoying myself.

I had been losing weight, and people were mentioning that they could see it in my ass and thighs and in my face.  Then, in February, I lost my job.  I thought, ""cool, between looking for a job, I'll use my extra free time to work out!!""  But that didn't happen.  I was unemployeed for 2 months, and just spent all my extra time sleeping and moping about being depressed.  I honestly don't know how my boyfriend put up with it.  Anyway, I ended up gaining back all the weight I had lost, plus 3 extra pounds.  Gross.  
I just started a new job a couple weeks ago.  I walk 10 minutes to the bus stop in the morning and 10 or 20 minutes home from the bus stop in the afternoon (depending on where I get off).  I bring lunch to work every day to keep control of my cash and my calories, so that's pretty good.  If I forget my lunch, I walk 10 minutes or so to go buy food, then walk back to my office to eat it.  So I've been walking a fair amount.  Not bad.  I haven't actually been exercising at all, which is <em>very</em> bad.  BUT!!! my birthday is next Friday, and I also get paid that day, so I'm going to get myself a membership at Gold's Gym.

I eat pretty much the same thing every day.  Today's meals are a pretty good example of my average intake.
Breakfast was a bowl of Special K with non-fat milk.  Sometimes I'll have fruit with that, but not today.  If I don't take the time to eat cereal at home, I eat an Odwalla bar.
Lunch was an apple and a Campbell's Soup At Hand Chicken and Stars.
So far today I've also had a short cup of coffee with two French Vanilla creamers, and a cup of cocoa.  The cocoa isn't a usual choice, and I should definitely limit that.  I should be drinking more water.  And less cream in the coffee.  BLEH.
Dinner is where I usually slip up.  Last night I had Special K Vanilla Almond, but I often end up getting some kind of greasy, fatty, disgusting take-out.  I need to stop that.  It's costing me too much money and too many calories.

My other big eating weakness is the weekends.  I spend Friday night through Sunday night with Darryl.  He doesn't seem to care what he eats (for christ's sake, he eats cheeseburgers and french fries dipped in gravy... GRAVY!!!) and I usually end up eating CRAP when we go out together. So I need to figure out what's healthy at McDonald's, Jack in the Box, Denny's, Red Robin, Indian restaurants, Thai restaurants, and Chinese restaurants.  Jeez.  I'll work on that this weekend."

"event","<b>My Motivation:</b>  I'm sick of constantly worrying what other people think of my body and appearance.
I'm sick of avoiding strenuous activities that I want to do because I don't want anyone to see how much I struggle to keep up.
I want to be able to relax.  I want to be able to do anything I want, with anyone I want, whenever I want.  I want to stop being so insecure.

<b>Calorie Goals:</b>  My BMR is 1500.  I am completely sedentary, so that's another 300 calories, 1800 total out every day.  To lose 1 pound per week, I need a deficit of 500 calories.  My limit is 1300 calories per day before exercise.

<b>Food:</b>  I need to eat breakfast every morning.  I need to eat more vegetables and fruits.  I need to stop drinking soda, coffee, eating chips, pretzles, candy, cookies, etc.  I need to stop eating anything and everything Sarah or mom make for dinner.

<b>Exercise:</b>  I need to get back in the habit of working out every day.  I need to do both cardio and strength training.  I want to start running every day.  http://www.stumptuous.com/weights.html

<b>Positive Thoughts:</b>  It took a long time to gain this weight, and it will take a long time to lose it.  That doesn't mean I should give up.  It will take time, but it will be worth it.  People in worse shape than me have lost more than I need to lose.  This is very possible."

"event","Wow. Its been a while, eh? I have a new man in my life now, we've been together for almost a year and I am pretty sure we will get married.  And, I am in a doctoral program for developmental psych.  I don't really plan on updating this that often. I am mostly just back to update my community <lj user=""sjp_fans"">, which is a fan community for Sarah Jessica Parker.  Please feel free to join if you would like!

"event","The trip home for my Dad's birthday went really well! he was totally surprised and even cried when he saw me (aww).  We also had a graduation party for my brother, so it was really nice to spend my short time there with most of my family members (at least from my dad's side). Highlights from the party include roasting a pig (nasty), and a racoon shooting by my crazy drunk cousin.  And no, believe it or not, we are NOT hillbillies.  

My mom is making me mad.  I miss talking to her and everytime I call, she's busy working late at work or doing something at home...grr....

Work is killing me this week, I dont know why.  I'm so tired.  It's so tempting during naptime to blow off paperwork and take a nap with the kids.  They've been so out of control this week for all of us teachers.  Craziness is what it is, really.

Anyway, its late, gotta get to bed so I can be energized for my kids!

"event","I get to go to Cleveland tomorrow morning! I'm so excited! I don't think that my dad has a clue that I am coming or that we are planning something (or at least I hope).  We've tried really hard to keep it under wraps.  The only thing I am worried about now is that he might want to try and get to my uncle's earlier than he's supposed to.  I need this weekend to breathe since I have been so stressed out about school stuff.  School starts in like 3 weeks! Eep! 

Ok, well, I hope you all have a great weekend!!*

"event","God, I am so angry right now.  And as usual it's with my best guy friend.  He makes me so frustrated.  For years now, we have these terrible and stupid arguments.  And for the past year, I've found that I get irritated with him extremely easily.  And I feel sort of bad.  I feel like I've driven him into the corner with me.  As a best friend to someone, you kind of expect for that other person to come to you and whine about things, serious or simply ridiculous.  I've come to the realization that I am a very dramatic person.  I get upset over many things, and many times, yes, I will say, I am exaggerating, but I cant help it.  I'm also prone to becoming seriously depressed and having nervous breakdowns.  

The thing with him though, is that when I do go to him with a problem, he either A. says something along the lines of ""steph, just chill out"" or ""steph, you're being ridiculous"" B. he says nothing for long periods of time whether its online or over the phone. or C. both.  so, as you can probably guess, all of these things make me angry.  If you are upset about something, do you want someone to just tell you, ""oh, you just need to calm down, you're overexgerrating""?! <b>NO</b> of course not! And just listening to silence doesnt work for me either, it just doesn't.  If I am talking to you, please talk back to me.  If I didnt care about getting a response, I could sit in front of the mirror and talk to myself (although then I still think I would get more out of it!!) So, now, he just doesnt know what to do with me, if he says something, its wrong, and if he doesnt, its wrong.  He loses either way.  Its not always that way, but it seems to be becoming more and more like that everyday.  I dont even think he cares anymore he's probably so used to it at this point.  I've taken so many breaks from him to make it better, Im starting to wonder if its just a waste of my time and energy to keep it going.  

Its just hard because we are supposed to be such good friends.  And if you cant go to your best friend with your problems, who can you go to? I guess I am disappointed and kind of hurt.  I love him so much, but I cant do this.  I guess all I can do is one of two things 1. just stop going to him or 2. realize that if I do, I may not hear what I want/need to hear and I'll just have to deal with that because this is how he is.  We always end with ""I dont know what to do"" and I, I really dont.


Ok, enough.  Sorry I write so much, its weird keeping one of these journals again.  I just wanna go to sleep.  Goodnight.

"event","I woke up this morning with every intent to make my day off productive and do some school work.  It's almost 8 o'clock and I havent done a thing.  I woke up early this morning and got myself over to the mall to get something to wear over my pretty shirt that I am wearing to my dad's party.  I stayed there wayyy longer than I needed to and had to force myself NOT to by anymore things.  Let me tell you, that was really hard.  There were all these sales, and omg, all these pink shoes.  Its like just shoot me now. I tried on this really great skirt, but couldnt buy it because it was too expensive :(. I really really need to stop spending all of my money.  I have barely saved anything from my earnnings this summer.  It's all went to plane tickets and stupid shit.  I'm supposed to be paying for my car...argh.  My mom and Gerry are not happy with me right now...

So, as I was walking up to my apartment, I noticed this large, middle-aged sunburned man sitting in a lawn chair on the patio of the apartment below mine.  What makes this strange is that this kid (who I am guessing is his son) was shaving the man's head and back.  It totally made me want to vomit in my own mouth, but then made me laugh at the randomness that is my life and this apartment complex.  

Ok, I want some freakin' ice cream now.

"event","So, work was work...I told my boss that my last day is going to be August 13th and that I dont think it will make sense for me to come back once school starts.  My schedule is just going to be too complicated and I need to find a different job (if I can have one at all) thats going to be less work and stress.  It does make me kind of sad though because I really love the kids and I'm going to miss them!!

Speaking of school, I sooo need to be doing work.  I finally emailed my directing professor about my honors thesis last week, so I am hoping that he gets back to me soon so we can finally narrow down on a topic! As far as studying for the GRE goes, well, that just isnt happening, I just dont want to do it.  I am probably screwing myself over and I will be beating myself up when I do badly on it.  I'm also supposed to be looking for 15 Ph.D. programs to apply to, and again, just dont wanna do it.  This so isnt like me at all...

Im freaking out about my future.  This is it for school, once I apply to grad school, it would be stupid of me to turn back.  I think thats been one of my biggest problems this summer, I keep questioning what I am doing.  I've never questioned it.  I've been saying I want to be a clinical child psychologist since high school.  And now, its hitting me that I've never thought about anything else that I might be better at or that I would love more than this.  Im just trying to keep the faith that God will steer me on the right path.

Ooooh, I am so excited for this weekend because I get to go home <b>home</b> (meaning Cleveland) for my Dad's 50th birthday! We're having a surprise party and my dad doesnt know I am coming.  The surprise is starting to get complicated, my uncle told him he's just having a party at his house on Saturday, but now my dad wants to help him with it, and obviously, he can't.  So erm, all this stuff, its just retarded...it makes my head hurt...


Anyway, this was a really long entry, sorry! Bye kids!

"event","Well, after holding a journal at ujournal, blurty, and deadjournal, I've finally made the move over to LJ with the masses.  We'll see how long it lasts.  I know a lot of you guys have one of these so leave me comments so we can add each other! I'm going to try to keep this journal simple, just trying to leave it with what its supposed to be about: my life.  So enjoy..."

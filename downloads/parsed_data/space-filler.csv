"event","<lj-cut text=""From the SMH.""><b>How big could a sardine grow, if it weren't caught and canned?</b>

Not very. When sardines get bigger they become pilchards, which are a favoured food of marlin, humpbacks, minkes, seals, dolphins, cormorants, gulls and sharks. Plus they make a great bait for tailor. The shelf life of a can of sardines far exceeds the expected life of a sardine in the ocean. 
<i>David Gribble, New Lambton</i>

Is it an African sardine or a European sardine?
<i>Josh Quigley, Gerringong</i>

A sardine can refer to any one of several small species of herring that belong to the Clupeidae family. The Australian pilchard or sardine is the same species found off California, Peru, South Africa, Chile and Japan, and is closely related to the European sardine (Sardina pilchardus). This species can live up to nine years and reach 26cm at maturity. The largest sardine is the Atlantic sardine or Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), which can grow up to 40cm at maturity.
<i>Sam Hunter, Wentworth Falls</i>


<b>Is there an easy, environmentally friendly way to reduce the bulk of polystyrene packing so we can fit it in the rubbish bin?</b>

Once upon a time, precious items were packaged in polystyrene balls, but nowadays these are made from potato. Wet them and they shrivel to nothing. I can't imagine why larger pieces of packaging are not made from this clever and environmentally friendly medium.
<i>Josephine Howie, Mosman</i>


<b>If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, why is it wrong to have your cake and eat it?</b>

Probably for the same reason that many hands make light work but too many cooks spoil the broth.
<i>Tony Alston, West Haven</i>

Because that's the way the cookie crumbles.
<i>Mary Carde, Cherrybrook</i>

The proof of the pudding is in the eating - that is, a pudding's looks are not important, the taste is. But it isn't ""wrong"" to have your cake and eat it; the aphorism is ""You can't have your cake and eat it too"", meaning you can't be the proud owner of a non-renewable resource as well as using it up. A bit like Warragamba Dam.
<i>Ros Keifer, South West Rocks</i>


<b>What happens if you eat the silica from those ""do not eat"" packets?</b>

Packets of silica are placed in the packaging of consumer electronics and other products. This provides some protection from damp and condensation during shipping or storage. The silica tends to absorb the moisture before it damages the fragile item. If you eat the silica, your package is more likely to be damaged by moisture.
<i>David A. Vincent, Lidcombe</i>

The hospital people will think you're a moron.
<i>Laura Perusco, Gerringong</i>

Nothing much, but it won't taste like either pudding or cake.
<i>J. Barrie Brown, Gordon</i>


<b>Why do footballers run and remove their shirts when they score goals?</b>

So they can score off the field as well.
<i>Randolph Magri-Overend, Point Clare</i>

To show that they have hair on their chest - and in women's teams, that they have not.
<i>Gerry Wagemans, Epping</i>

To cool and display their hot and sweaty pectorals.
<i>Erhard Gohl, Allambie Heights</i>

Testosterone.
<i>Peter Dresser, Coonamble</i>

I don't know, but I do wonder why women's football isn't a more popular spectator sport.
<i>Laura Perusco, Gerringong</i>

To show sportswomen how to celebrate after a win.
<i>George Hayes, Sydney</i>

What do you want them to do? Stand stock still and remove their shorts?
<i>John Edwards, Dulwich Hill</i></lj-cut> They ask quesions, people submit answers."

Okay, I understand that some rules of grammar are hard to remember (the apostrophe of possession, for example), but one particular card completely lost it on one of the most simple there is - ""your/you're"". What's worse is that it's not uncommon. Grammar is a lost art.

I'm back on the blood capsules (ugh), but they should make me feel better/actually awake. I shouldn't have stopped taking them so early, really, but... oh well.
I think i'm in a vicious cycle. I realised that it was around this time last year that I was sick/getting sick (I think). I should see a doctor, rather than just sitting here and whinging about it, but there are just so many symptoms, and I figure i've already diagnosed myself anyway (with various cancers and such). So we'll see.

Enough about that though. Onto something far more enjoyable - pumpkin soup. There is some in the making here, and it's looking and smelling delicious. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. I love chicken stock. I reckon I could drink a glass of it.
We also have prawns, avocado, pineapple and marinated fetta. I sure do love it when mum goes shopping.

All this talk of food has got me hungry, so i'm going to go enjoy this glorious food. May all have good ones and buckets of gold.

"event","After all this time we've finally decided to fix up Tina for me to drive (after a swift kick from the RTA telling us to either register or give up the plates). Lube mobile are coming out sometime today (between 1 and 3) and we'll go from there. We've got two weeks to fix her up in and hopefully then I'll be driving. It looks like we need to replace the timing belt and various other things. Possibly the battery. Not cool, but worth it.
Go car!"

"event","What a weekend.
Friday night was Jim's fire. Good.
Saturday not a lot happened, Saturnight was Skye's nans house with some peoples. Also good.
Sunday was the worst day of my life. Well, between the hours of 4 and about... 6 it  was. The Eels played the worst I have ever seen them play, after taking 4 years to get to the freakin finals. WOE.
BUT ANYWAY, things soon got better when we (us and Liz, Michael, Smudge and Face) were sitting around during the night. Michael was randomly on the net and happened to find a really good deal on a cruise from Auckland to Sydney. So...

<font size=36><font color=#0000CC>NEW ZEALAND HERE WE COME!</font size=36></font color=#0000CC>

We're flying over on the 8th of Feb and spending a few days in Auckland, the <a href=""http://my.tdctrade.com/photolib/hk/0500013L.jpg"">cruise</a> leaves on Saturday (the 11th) and we get into Sydney on Tuesday. 
Awesome!


So that's my news."

"event","Laying in bed last night, two thoughts popped into my head:

1. I wonder how many hands could fit into one pocket? (average pair of jeans pocket. None of those crazy able-to-fit-small-horses-into pockets)

2. How cool would a toaster light be? Or toaster lamp shade or something. Then I was thinking maybe alarm clock? I don't know how that worked but it was something to do with using the bread-putter-downer-er as a snooze button. Or lever.. as the case may be..
Right now I don't know how plausible that would be, but last night it worked. It really did."

Where are these so called ""typical males""?

I saw a GUYS shirt at the shops today with something about ""love"" on it. Not to mention the fact it was PINK.

What's going on?! Did I miss something?!
I think now i've figured out my problems with the opposite sex - I'm not romantic and I don't want a relationship.
Who would have thought that guys would be into that kind of thing?

Where are the good old non-sensitive, non-emotional, sex-driven guys huh? I'd take one of them any day."

"event","While in the shower today I noticed that our shampoo claims to be ""fast-acting"".
... How can a shampoo be fast acting? Are other shampoos slow acting? Who am I? What am I doing with my life?

No, I don't really expect anyone to know what the shampoo is on about (or me, for that matter), I just thought it odd.



That is all.



EDIT: It feels like summer. It really does. The wind is WARM, and has that.. smell. Scent'O'Summer. It's crazy, and kinda nice."

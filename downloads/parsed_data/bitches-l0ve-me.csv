i read Smack in two days it was good and everyone should read it =P 
then i hung out with le stacy<3 i went to her house after i drank SO MUCH caffiene i was like bouncy. we fell asleep at like 530 during harry potter =P then we went to applebese and i ate a salad because im fat and dont need cheeseburgers for a while ohhh i shall miss you ;) then we decided to see the exorcism of emily rose. it was super duper uber freaky - mostly because it was a true story. It wasnt as scary as marcello and kayluhh made it out to be even though i was clinging to stacy like a mo fo =P 

schools going pretty good too. doing pretty much all the shiz that i need to do but my art teacher hates me and picks on me all the time =( 

im buying le homecomming ticket tomorrow =) should be fun <3 i need to stop being fat by the time homecomming comes though. Then msi <333333333333 i cant wait - i finally get to go with le girlfriend. I want to go to mas shows <3 aaaand thats pretty much it

so i decided to do my summer reading project but i dont know what the paper needed to be on so i gave up on that haha my teachers only counting it as a test grade so i dont think ima do it because as long as i do all my other work and do good ill be able to get at least a B in that class sooo whatevaaa. 
soo this weekend was cool hung out with stacy because it was her birthday weekend and we went to dinner and then to dinner again and i fell off a table because it was wettt and then sunday she was gna sleep over but she ended up going home. Theeeen todayy i woke up and i was le uber dead so i do what i do best""mom i have a migrane and cramps can i stay home?"" twas a tad bit more difficult then usual but she let me stay home and she didnt even tell my daddy which is good because im sick of hearing him bitch. 
so then i slept all day till like 2 and did laundry and all that fun shizz and played spongebob games online because im a loserrrr. 
soo i want a new ring for my tragusss - i want it to be smaller and such. oh well. i dont think its infected anymore which is good and its not swollen or anything which is also good *moves on to next piercing<3* i think im getting a job soon too needsta talk to alex about that. amanda + job = woah. 
so it was weird watching the sweet 16 show on mtv because all these people are my age and it doesnt seem like it. eep i need to get my permitt! ima get someones book or whatever to study off of and take my four hour course online. asfl;kajf i have my four hour class this saturday for my fucking smoking ticket =( the hours arent bad 9 - 2 or something like that at least its not gna take up my entire saturday. hokay im rambleing because im le uber tired. so chow chow brown cow"

"event","sooo warped tour today was AHHMAZING<33 

felbie called me this morning and woke me up and i almost cried but at least i had enough time to get ready because stacy wasnt even awake yet *lazy bum that i <3* so then felbies driving down to springs and calls me telling me that almost everyone worth seeing already played =( i was le uber disapointed about that because i realy wanted to see the academy is<33 but i didnt but oh well. oh and there was another problemoo - i didnt have a flippen ticket and kendall told felbie that they were all sold out but whatever we decided to go anyways and just deal with the problem when we got there. so he gets to mi casa with stacy in the car<3 and we had to go to his house to feed speedball and it was like 12:30 aaand then we were done with that and left for warped tour!! but ofcoarse we had to get turbo iced coffees at dunk n donuts fiiirst tehe. so we finally get there and we see or cuban buddy dave<3 his amigos didnt have tickets either so we were all on the huntttt!! well some girl walks by and like says to herself ""does anybody want a ticket?"" YESSSS so we chase after her and she gave me her ticket for 25$ which was realy cheap. so i was all excited and we get to the entrance and the dude scans my ticket and it wouldnt work because the cunt face already went in with the ticket and it cant be scanned twice and since stacy and felbie are already in - they cant get back out. so i find dave and then we all were super spys and got in by going under the fence muahaha i ripped one of my favorite shirts though =( but i bought a new one <33 tehe so we just hung out and saw a bunch of people that i havent seen in forever. i saw the offspring with mikeala and she was like my little warped tour baby! it was cute she was all excited and after they played she found me a hat and i have it now<33 so today i sawww starting line<3 offspring and fall out boy with le stacy but it started to rain so they told us all to go hooome and my phone got fucked up in the process =( but anyways i loved today and it sure as hell is a good way to end a summer. speaking of summer ending it makes me sad =( i hung out with stacy like every day *that i was in the country* and now when school starts my parents dont want me leaving the house monday - thurseday which is realy gay and ima miss my girlfriend =( 

hrm well anyways im off hommies i hope you enjoy your last hours of summer."

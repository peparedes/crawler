"event","When I was a child, I told time by how long it had been since I was born. So my second year of school would be when I was six. As I grew older, it became how many years since I'd entered school, so I was no longer having things occur when I was sixteen, it was during my sophomore year. Until of late, I told time by the time in my relationship, so last year would have been year 6, not 24, or Senior +6, etc. Now I find myself starting that calendar over again with another landmark event in my life. The permanent parting of myself from my ex.

She came by to pick up some stuff today, and got inside my head. I got to thinking about the promises I'd made to her... and how important my honor is to me, about the fact that I said I'd never leave her. That I loved her more than anything, That I would never say no. That I would never hurt her. And now I am finding my self for the first time in ages actively deciding to break my word. This is not a decision I arrive at easily, or quickly, but rather, one I arrive at after days of considering what is best for me, and what is dangerous for me. It is not honorable to, in keeping one's word, become dishonorable. That is the failure of the man to see the long term, in favor of the short. I cannot continue to walk a self-destructive path, following a woman I HOPE would someday come to truly love me and cherish me, as I did her for so many years. But I will idolize her no more.

I have always considered myself to be a member of a knighthood of one... No, it isn't cool, and no, I don't think I'm decended from a line of knights of any sort, rather, I see myself as a strong, powerful man. And with that power comes responsibility to those around me. That is what I mean when I say I am le chevalier du sacre coeur. The knight of the Sacred Heart. I do not fight for God because I do not pretend to understand his will, or know what to act in defense of. Instead I fight for what my heart tells me to. For the good of those around me, I give up what I must to protect them, and care for them. I give of myself so others can have what they must. This has been my way since I was a small child. But there is one small problem with a knighthood of one.

You're the only one.

That means if the Knight falls, there is no other to take his place. No champion to the cause of the good and righteous. No heart to follow, means no chevalier du sacre coeur. If I allow myself to be dragged down paying homage to a word as though I was something more than human, something that could go through life without breaking my word, or even just without conciously deciding to break it, then I would not only be so conceited as to walk upon the grave of God after by my own beliefs killing him, but I would be doing the world a disservice by taking from them the only one that serves that cause. The only one left that protects the weak from the strong. 

I&nbsp;have to return to my other duties as a Knight. To protect everyone... not just her.. from the dangers around them, to respect and protect life, until death. 

It is now within me to break my word, if it needs to be done. I have found that bridge and crossed it, So do not try to put that river between me and my success alone. Because you will fail, and will be, in effect, abjuring my last requirement of myself where you are concerned."

"event","Not because I'm getting off, but because I'm taking what I want and need from life back, and it's easier to aim when the world stands still. So how does one get the world to stop? Well that's relatively simple, get out of your relationships. See, when you're in a relationship, in a way, your universe revolves around that person. Everything in your lives affect one another, so you can't control your own life. You can't get a grip because you always have to be concious of the other person. So when you sever that tie, you get a much more stable world to take aim for your dreams. Yeah it sounds cheesy, but it's really true. Now to some, whom have amazing relationships already, the risk just isn't worth the reward, and I applaud those of you that this remains true for. But if you've got the opportunity, and your life is out of control, your relationship is steadily declining... take matters into your own hands. Turn the whole thing around by taking control of what you can. End the relationship so you can see things clearly, fix yourself, take control of your life, and get where you want to be. Then if you really want to look up the old flame. He/She/it will probably still be there, and might even be single, but you will be a thousand times more attractive since you have control of your life. That sort of control appeals to pretty much everyone. Even if they don't like you to control THEM.

What spawned this is that once again, my ex fiancee has dumped me. I got home today and all of her belongings were gone. She claimed her reasoning was that she was afraid of me, but hell, last time I touched her in anger, it was to hold her down because SHE was hitting ME. Then I covered her mouth when she screamed because it was the middle of the night and we live in an apartment. Once she calmed down, I let her go. Before that yes, once, I hit her. She hit me, knocked off my glasses, and I hit her back... and one other time, where she hit me, and I hit her back and asked if she liked how it felt. It was a self-defensive action, but still inexcuseable, as she isn't physically capable of harming me with her fists. Her other excuses, actually the first ones, were about her. That she'd been using me for years because I was financially stable, that she begged her ex boyfriend to marry her and take her with him when he left for boot camp, that she didn't love me anymore and it wasn't fair to me, that she wasn't really there because of her anti-depression meds making her sleep all of the time and that wasn't fair... And yea, at first, I got angry. But then I realized something.

She told me she was going to run off with her ex boyfriend but he said no... and yet I was trying to appologize to HER.

I wanted HER back... after that level of betrayal.

After all the lies.

After she cheated on me twice in the same calendar month, and had the nerve to still ask me if I trusted her, and get upset if I said no.

I wanted HER back.

No.

And that &quot;no.&quot;&nbsp;was probably the most powerful thought that has ever gone through my head... by extension. You see when I cut that tie, when I said no, I don't want you back, the break suddenly became very easy to handle. She was just doing what I would have done if I had known what she had done. And more, it gave me the willpower to do all sorts of things I've been putting off for ages. I actually started another exercise routine. I can only assume it will continue, as I don't have a whole lot else to do.

The only door that yet remains closed, is the doorway to another relationship. I'm a nerd, where the hell am I gonna meet women? I don't drink, so a bar is out. And everywhere else I can think to go, is places where couples go to spend time. If anyone has any ideas, feel free to leave me a message."

This morning: A ""breakfast burrito"" at QT... it's a slip, but I didn't have time to make breakfast, and all my pills require food.

Lunch was tacos made of chicken, grilled peppers, onion, corn, a little sour cream, and some salsa (150 mg sodium.) on a corn tortilla... I had two, and then one on bread. Too much. I would have been fine, I just wanted to get the disgusting taste of the corn tortillas out of my mouth.

I ate one slice of pizza at dinner left over from david's, he wanted to get rid of the box and such because it was just taking up space. I also had a few slices of cheese yesterday just for something to nibble on I need to remind myself when I'm home not to eat so damn much.

Kim doesn't like my 2-3 oz portions of the coho salmon she bought, but tough, that's all you need. Suppliment the lack of food with veggies, not with more meat more meat more meat. Corn, tomato, lemon, peppers, all these go well with salmon. Deal."

2 wendy's grilled chicken go wraps, 6"" tortilla, lettuce, little cheese, and honey mustard with about a 1/3 of a chicken breast.

A little later, around 2:00...

Wendy's salad grilled chicken salad, no dressing, no croutons, I got this at the same time as the wraps, but ate them an hour or two apart.

around 5:30 or 6:00, I had a bowl of cereal, I probably need to stop eating these, they're good for making me not hungry while I try to think of what to make for dinner, but I could choose something better for my body, like baby carrots.

Around 7 or 8:00, a leftover garlic pasta of some sort. There was a lot of oil in the bottom, but I drained all I could off of the mastachelli noodles I ate, with salt and pepper.

Not the best day, but it's doable, and I was proud of myself because my roommate and his girlfriend got pizza, and I didn't ask for a slice. I mean I wanted to, but I didn't, and I was particularly glad I didn't even WANT the chocolate dipper whatevers that Pizza Hut is making now.

OI! I haven't done one of these for a while... WoW update...

Sonosuke is level 70, human fire spec mage. I crit 40% or more of the time, and do just shy of 900 DPS reliably.
Karisita is level 40, she's a prot-spec warrior, just learned to wear plate, I reallly like her.
The rest, I'm not really sure. These are my two mains. And I love 'em to death.

Kim started a clan... me and her are butting heads on it a lot.... she's making some of what I believe are bad decisions. But whatever, it is what it is."

This was at about 7:00 or 7:30.

Then around 9:00 or 10:00 I had a bowl of honey nut cheerios... and about 11:00 I had maybe five strips of julienned bell peppers.

OH, and just before dinner, because Kim insisted on waiting till we finished an instance in World of Warcraft to cook, I had maybe 10-15 crackers with salsa. The salsa only had I think 120 sodium per two tablespoons, so it wasn't too bad. No fats, so I thought it was pretty safe."

I went to a kfc/pizza hut express for lunch (monday I'm going to get a 3lb salad from Costco, but if I got one now it'd just go bad in the office fridge over the weekend) and I got one of their twister wraps, a 10-inch tortilla with lettuce, tomato, roasted chicken breast, I think a little cheese and some ranch dressing. It came with potato wedges, which I'm sure were all sugar and I'm not getting them again. I had a dr. pepper, 20 oz, but I didn't like the taste, I dunno if they had bad dr pepper, or if my taste buds are changing again, but I'm not really feeling soda anymore, I want tea, water, maybe some milk.

However my roommate had a cheese pizza, breadsticks, a cookie, and 6 honey barbeque wings, and the honey barbeque wings were filling the air with scent, so I had ONE and then I was done. No refills on the drink, no more wings, just my wrap and wedges. Monday I'll be on something a little more healthy."

10:00 AM
Fruit platter, mango, cantaloupe, kiwi, strawberry, and grapes, 16oz.

12:30 PM
chicken caesar salad, almost no dressing, no croutons, really salty chicken, not going back to wendys for this.
chicken go-wrap, grilled.

I drank 2 20oz bottles of water this morning, a 32 oz cup of black tea (prolly a bad idea since I'm getting a headache), and I'll probably drink another 1 or 2 bottles of water before I leave work.

When I get home, I'm going to be doing some weights to try and strengthen my back, knees, and calves... my roomate showed me a few routines that will work on my lower back, my knees, my calves, I don't have a whole lot of weight to work with, but these workouts aren't to build huge muscles, they're to tone and return the strength just to remain standing without having a heart-attack, so doing one set till I feel the burn should be plenty, even if it takes forever. 

In a personal note, I'm in the open beta for Wrath of the Lich King for World of Warcraft. I have a 58 death knight, and a 70 mage in the beta realms, and so far I love it, the death knight is a little overpowered though."

"event","<p>I got a promotion at work, I'm taking over Diane's job, now I'm a secretary/accountant/graphic artist/tech support/whatever else is needed at the time. In addition to that I still have my duties in the back, but if I can't keep up with my duties in the front... eh... *grunts*<br /><br />Current fixation: PSX - Legend of Dragoon. I love this game, I don't know why. There were parts that could be better, but it worked for what it was.<br /><br />Music - Sean Paul - We Be Burning is for some reason fixating me. I have no clue why.<br /><br />Maybe some people out there want to know me a little better... well...<br /><br />I'm highly disorganized, about most things anyway, but at the end of the day the things I care about are in a very precise order, and I don't like them fooled with. I'm touchy about a lot of things. My sensabilities are one of them. The thing is I calm when things are not rubbed wrong very quickly as well. For instance, when my sensabilities are assuaged, I no longer am offended. I don't carry things around with me, because that leaves me with too heavy a load.&nbsp;<br /><br />I tend to not worry about the things I can't change. Again, I can't afford to carry all that baggage with me, every once in a while I'll break out the ol' dust buster and see what issues I can get rid of, but if I can't do anything about it, I don't worry. I have enough trouble keeping my sanity without worrying about every little thing.<br /><br />I guess this is part of my problem with women. Women tend to take EVERYTHING to heart, and carry EVERY little thing with them all the time. Just look at our mentalities. Men have survived thousands of years without much in the way of carrying devices unless we absolutely HAVE to bring more with us than we can carry. However women have taken the concept of a carrying device to the point of making a fashion point centered around a ""purse"" which is a carrying device used to hold anything from financial records, to kleenex, to candy, to the bloody kitchen sink. They do the same thing in their heads. They collect all this junk in their heads until they can't handle even the least little thing, then they start crying... which brings me back to point #1: I'm touchy. I HATE people who cry about every little thing. It annoys me. *whine whine whine* my car died... okay, did it start again? *sob* yeeeeesss... THEN WHAT ARE YOU BITCHING ABOUT? Christ, bring me something I can FIX. If you want to cry, do what I do, hold it back till you're all alone then cry your heart out because all you're going to do whining in front of other people about innane bullshit, is remind them just how much worse they have it, and how little they're allowed to show it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Case in point: I have a VERY rough and stressful life right now. I'm having to learn accounting (which is NOT easy, it's not just like balancing the checkbook each month, it's recording where every dollar and dime went, in a way which allows a CPA at the end of the year to go over them with a fine toothed comb in such a way as to minimize actual time spent, while maximizing the amount of money he can charge FOR that time.), our accounting SOFTWARE (I knew how to do this, basically, on pen and paper already, I just never did know the details of it.), grapic arts and the Adobe software suite, and on top of all this learning, my boss is in CANCUN enjoying a week off. Lucky him. Meanwhile I'm stuck up here doing three people's jobs, while the company is on the brink of collapse because my boss took a 700 dollar check that he shouldn't have. As it stands, I have to do payroll in three days, and I don't know if we'll have the money to do that, let alone pay the light bill. After all this, I come home to relax. Find out my girlfriend did NOT decide to come in that day because she ""thought you didn't need me"" because I was short with her on the phone -- because I had a call on the other line. Found out she didn't go to her interview in Kansas, because her car window is busted out. She knew she had the busted window, and not only didn't she go to the interview, she didn't call either, to let her know that she wasn't coming. She didn't clean a damn thing, granted, she didn't mess anything up, but the ""mess"" is because me and my roommate had to clear everything out of the closets for an inspection or be kicked out. It seems only fair to me, since we did all the work pulling it out (And we were NOT messy about it, everything is organized and in bags and boxes, all we need is for someone to wipe out the cabinets, and put stuff away), that she do some of the work of putting it away - in fact a majority of the work - since she didn't deem it worth her time to help get ready for the inspection. Then she cries because I told her that if she wants me to help her pay her 313.00 bill this month, she needs to show some damn effort trying to pay it herself, and come in to work like I asked her to, so I don't see her just lounging around on her lazy ass all day while I do all the work to pay her bills. So this drives me up a f-ing wall, because her day has been spent lounging around ""trying to fix her computer"" which she's been working on for two days. Granted, it had a boot sector virus, but it's had that since she got the thing. She wastes her time CONSTANTLY Format, install windows, reformat, install windows AGAIN, reformat, re-partition, reformat, install windows, this is how she ""wipes"" her hard drive. I spent weeks telling her she needed to stop doing all that because it'll fuck the HD, I told her she needed to use fixmbr, I told her she needed to remove the new memory because the problems all started getting bad then. But no, she doesn't listen. Now five days total after this happened, she removes the memory, uses fixmbr, and voila, a virus free computer. Wow, isn't that amazing? So to recap, she didn't listen to me on something she KNEW I knew what I was talking about on, causing her to waste three days trying to fix the probelm I'd already told her how to fix, and wound up loosing the prospect of a 13.00/hr job 7 mo guaranteed. Now because she's chosen to turn down 40k/year, it falls to ME to pay her bills when she's short. And she wonders why I get snappy? And after all THIS, I have to listen to my roomate bitch about how his girlfriend left him. Background info - last night he went to a masquerade ball with her, and next wednesday he's going to a halloween party with her, and last night she spent the night, he knows she loves him, and frankly, it's getting on my fucking nerves the way he's bitching about EVERYTHING. Get the fuck over yourself, you can't change it, you can't fix it, all you can do is shut up, stop bitching, and move on. But no, I can't say this because he said about how he's starting to come out of his shell, and let people know what he's feeling, and I can't stand in the way of that, really, I'm just sick of hearing his bullshit. Get the fuck over it, go thru denial like everyone else so I can get a FEW days of rest, so MY mental and emotional batteries can recharge. Never f-ing mind the fact that in the household we got hit with over $1500 in surprise bills this month, and lo and behold, if ANYONE fails to pay in full, I'm out. And guess who the ONE of us that doesn't have a SINGLE surprise bill is? ME. Because I keep track of my shit, because I keep everything, all this data, in a VERY organized fashion. I know EXACTLY what is due, and EXACTLY when it is due, I know what I owe, and when I owe it. I also know WHEN I'm getting money, and HOW much it's gonna be. So in other words, I'm in a house where I have two dependents, and no intelligence, and it's just driving me batty.<br /><br />I'll have a wow update at the beginning of November, just to keep with the timing.<br /><br />Shaun.</p>"

"event","<p>Okay, so last Wednesday was my birthday, and among those who noticed was one I would rather not have gotten any birthday wishes from. Now mind you, I have no hate for the guy, but we have an agreement. He is restricted from having any contact with me, and I from him. Simple enough, you leave me alone, I'll leave you alone. Technically I suppose we both have the capability to make each other's lives a living hell, and we just both decided, with a bit of help from outside forces that needed not be involved since we'd already MADE this decision prior to their involvement, that it was best if we no longer communicated. I found this amicable, since I'd only had the boss called on me because I screwed up and used my mod codes instead of my personal ones when I went to TELL him that I'd decided to have zero contact with him, and from what I heard, he felt the same.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, again, he was perfectly respectful, as always, impeccable, but I would have perferred if he'd simply stuck to our agreement. I do miss the roleplay in the room that he was in. I do miss the conversations I had with him, but I just can't be around him, and I do wish he'd kept to our arrangement. Oh I'm not reporting him or anything, I don't really care, it's just a birthday wish, but I'd just rather keep things entirely seperate.<br /><br />I also got a birthday wish from emda... thank you hon, I'm sorry I haven't responded to it yet, but I've been sick as hell lately, and I really didn't even feel like getting out of bed since thursday.&nbsp;<br /><br />Yes yes, I'm sick... again. Tonsilitis, Pharyngitis, and something else, I don't remember what. I'm on the trailing end though, finishing out my meds and dealing with the last few bits of pain.<br /><br />I'm moving into a new apartment, with a friend of mine and my girlfriend, I'm a little concerned we might have an oops-a-baby... mental note... NEVER put lube UNDER the condom. *shakes head* It's a place my friend has lived in for two years, I'm taking over the lease from his former roommate, so we're both on the lease. I'm going to be moving all my furnature in this weekend, I think. My grandma is giving me money to rent a truck. Unfortunately, the clinic bills from getting my sickness on the road to recovery is going to kill me. Cost somewhere around $150, right after I just had to have my car repaired for $375, and borrow $100 to make sure I could make rent. I hope my mom will help me pay off that credit card, because I was hoping to transfer a good deal of money from my old card to my new one, because it's 0% interest for a year, which would help me get that $300 off my credit, and stop the over the limit fees. Perhaps I'll post pictures of the new place when I get a chance, but for now, I'm going to have to wait, my g/f has everything of hers moved in, but my stuff won't be in till the 6th-7th, because my mom is out of town, and I'm watching the dog and the house.&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh, WoW update:<br /><br />Sonosuke (Human Mage): Is now level 39, halfway to 40, and rested till halfway to 41. I'm just real hesitant to actually go up that half a level, because I only have 2 gold, and at 40 I need 100... okay 90... gold... to get my mount. Gold is HARD to come by in that game. *sighs* I REALLY don't want to make it all the way to 40 and have to wait longer to get my mount.<br /><br />Yandia (Human Paladin): Now level 20. Blacksmithing's going along fairly well, but mining is lagging behind. I need to get her up to Arathi so I can mine some iron.&nbsp;<br /><br />Triconderoga (Night Elf Hunter): Now level 16, skinning and leatherworking are tedious. I'm kinda getting sick of this character.<br /><br />Atalia (Night Elf Priest): Now level 11. I haven't played her in weeks. She's my herbalist and alchemist. By the way that reminds me about how annoyed I am with the gaming industry's MISUSE of the term ALCHEMY. Unless you are professing that that profession changes the base elements and rearranges matter from one element to another, then it is NOT alchemy. The science you are referring to is correctly named CHEMISTRY, which is a process by which elements, compounds, and complex chemicals are mixed in order to provide the desired effect.<br /><br />Yargh (Tauren Warrior): Level 7. I'm irritated with this character, he's boring, and isn't living up to the expectations I had of a warrior. They're supposed to be tanks, but if I get hit by more than one creature, I'm screwed. Plus this is my only Horde character. (by the way, I love bungie. FOR THE FUCKING HORDE!!!)<br /><br />Correlan (Human Warlock): Level&nbsp;6, this guy isn't going to be as useful as I thought. I had thought a warlock, which creates soul shards, which are green items, being an enchanter (can disenchant green level or better items and turn them into magical components to place permanent bonuses on weapons and armor) would be highly useful. But then I find out that those shards are not disenchant-able. So I've kinda cooled my jets on this char.<br /><br />Sadel (Draenei Shaman): Level 5 I've been playing this one trying to get a feel for Shamans, but it's kinda pointless, I don't have time to play her regularly, and she's not all that interesting. Oh well, we'll see how she pans out.<br /><br />Hey, where'd my rogue go? BAH! That's annoying. Oh well.<br /><br />So for my birthday I was gifted cheap pizza, cheap muffins, and a birthday cake. Not all bad I suppose. I wish it'd been something less cholesterol heavy, but beggars can't be choosers.</p>"

"event","So I haven't made a post in two and a half weeks. Sue me. *lol*

I'm glad to hear things are going well for others, but I've seen other absolutely sickening things lately, particularly in the website where I roleplay at.

Seems someone had the audacity to go and snatch someone's real life picture from their user profile, someone who isn't very good looking, and has a plethora of debilitating diseases and other deformities, such as a missing eye. Someone I knew well, and he made an avatar out of that picture, putting it into a scene from Popeye with Robin Williams, putting that picture into the picture frame where ""me pappy"" is supposed to be taped. It was in bad taste, and hurtful, deliberately and premeditatively. It was wrong and he's done it before and he expects a simple appology rife with personal attacks against the man is going to be enough to placate an enraged community? Yeah, that didn't work for the LAPD when they beat down Rodney King either.

In related news, I've found SOMEWHAT of an outlet for my roleplay needs, I've been, ironically enough, playing World of Warcraft, something I swore I'd never do. But it turns out it's pretty fun. And I've got a GREAT guild. Rabitus Slayus. Our guild dues? Whenever you see a rabbit on the roads, you must kill it. *lol* Comes from the days where there used to be a BOD. Bunny of Doom. A level 99 rabbit that only appeared and agro'ed on you, when you'd killed enough bunnies. *chuckles* funny.

Out of an availiable ten species, and I think 8 classes, and 70 levels, I have...

A level 23 Human mage (Sonosuke)
A level 17 Human Paladin (Yandia)
A level&nbsp;9 Draenei Paladin (Azureath)
A level 6 Tauren Druid (Condina?)
And a level 14 Night Elf Hunter (Triconderoga)

Wow that's a lot of characters. But then some of them, like Yandia, can only be played when their partner is on. We're trying to keep them the same level. so my Draenei paladin is a miner and smither too, so she can send materials to my human paladin to keep her busy. Right now she requires like 15 bronze just to go up one rank in smithing. Ain't that a bitch? At BEST I can get 8 bronze per mine, and I've only done that once, more likely by far is the 2 or 4 copper mines. That way I can give her things to do. Hopefully get her to where she can use Bronze.&nbsp;

Anyway, I'm sure noone cares about that, just something fun I'm doing in my spare time, trying to fill it up. *sigh* Unfortuantely I am still without the pleasure of any form of female company. *lol* the funny part is it isn't even sex I miss. It's talking, even arguing, it's the time spent together, the hugs... watching movies, doing the same things, hell even doing different things. It's the times I cooked, and we ate, that's the sort of thing I miss and I want back. Hell the kind of things Dawn could only give me a few of when I was with her. That's why I got so worked up and lonely at times, because I was used to that constant presence, and now it's gone. Hell now I have even lost her in every way except as a friend. And that's so hard to do, because I do love her. Her attitude on everything just kinda brightens up my day. I don't really know why. But, it's something I have to learn to deal with. I care about her, and her happiness, and even if she DID want to be with me, where would I get off making her stay loyal to a guy a couple thousand miles away? Someone on the other side of the impenetrable barrier known as Canada. *shakes head* The worst part is I have no ways left to meet anyone. I don't go out, I don't know where I'd go if I did. I AM planning on going back to college soon. Speaking of which, I need to call MOHELA. Maybe I'll meet someone there. I doubt it though, I'm too shy. I'm a highly introverted person. And I'm afraid it probably won't happen. Who knows though. Hell I did break out of my bubble for Kim, maybe I'll manage to do it again.

Anyway, I'm gonna get outta here, gotta pick up some veggies, because my old ones went bad - I'm trying to get back on my diet."

"event","<p>Hmm... I'm not very secretive about things... and at this point, I have about five minutes to write...<br /><br />I suck at lying... I mean I can do it perfectly well. And you'll believe it. I just can't convince myself to put that kind of effort into decieving anyone. Not even people I positively can't stand. I took a step a week ago and I stand by it. I didn't do it for forgiveness, I didn't do it to try and get a friend back, and I don't know what other motivations I could possibly have. My reasons were simply this... To appologize. I wasn't looking for anything more than the chance to appologize for doing something incredibly wrong. Yes, it took me some time to realize it, but then I never claimed to be smart. There's a difference between intelligent, and smart. I like to think I am intelligent, but smart I've never claimed.&nbsp;<br /><br />And the only reason why I sought that, is because of my personal motto. Do nothing you'll regret, regret nothing you've done. I regretted what I said to someone I had called a friend. Out of anger, and hurt. Once bitten twice shy they say, I suppose this is an extension of that metaphor. It's not an excuse, I am enlightened enough to know the difference between the bear trap and the innocent bystander. The fact is that I started thinking about that regret more and more, and I had to rectify it, both for my mind, and most importantly, for hers. I don't know if it still bothered her what I said, but she deserved to know, wether for her peace of mind, or just because I believe that everyone has the right to know what I think of them. My appology was designed for nothing more than that. Nothing more than to tell someone I had once called friend that I was sorry for being mean and hateful. That there was no excuse, I just turned the asshole for no good reason.<br /><br />That's all it is. No strange motives, no hateful final solution, not even forgiveness. I just wanted her to know how I felt, and that I realize that what I said wasn't true.</p>"

"event","This is... complicated... why I'm here at all... but hopefully in the course of posting this I will answer all questions about what brings me here after over a month of not being here... not even looking.

I am posting this in hopes that one person will see it. Someone I have no means of contacting other than to post here. Because here is where I met her, and she for some reason still has me marked as a mutual friend, so I would appear on her friends page, if she ever looks at it. Trudy, I'm hoping you see this. It is for you, in the immediate, that I post at all.

Why seek out someone I barely knew? Good question. Simple question. I wish the answer was as simple.

While I may be seeking out Trudy in the immediate, in the ultimate it isn't her I'm trying to get to. However I am bound by terms of honor, and of agreements made in a professional standing, to not be able to contact the person I'm trying to get ahold of. Which leaves me in a sticky position. I have something I want her to know, but I can't contact her to tell her. BUT... I know Trudy knows her... and I can legally within the bounds of my agreement, and my honor, contact her, and she, I would hope, would convey the location... or at least the spirit... of the message to the woman I am trying to speak to.&nbsp;

So I spent ten minutes explaining why I'm posting at all, but what is it I want to say?

... I jumped the gun. I made assumptions... I made judgements... and I said things I shouldn't. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not looking for forgiveness, I don't want it. What I did was wrong, it was inexcusable. Had I gone back and read my words I'd have known that the misunderstanding was not intentional, and that she was NOT drawing lines in the sand by doing what she did. I'd have done the same thing if I would have interpreted what I said the way she did. I can not blame her for that. And yes, it's taken me two weeks to admit that... and two more to work up the nerve to say it. I offended a friend, someone who'd never done a damn thing to hurt me. And my message is simply this. I appologize. I'm not looking to be friends again, I've done this twice now, and there's an old saying... fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me... and my own addition... you don't get the chance to fool me a third time. Some people don't learn, and maybe I just don't. I was too vhement, and I hurt you, I don't expect to get away with something like that. There has to be consequences somewhere.

If you see this... I would appreciate you at least acknowledging it so I know it's been seen. And my message has been recieved.

Thank you in advance, and I'm sorry for what I said... I was way out of line.

Death and rebirth, the beginning and the end, inextricably tied throughout the universe in all things. Perhaps those two truths are what bind the universe together, the dark and the light. What once was will come again, to expect otherwise is folly. And once again I find myself in the grips of that circle. Was it all staged for my benefit? Or was it all real? I don't know, nor do I care. The colors of the enemy have been raised and they show their true allegiances. I have no desire or need to fight, so I walk away, but I leave this warning.

I despise conflict. Noone wins, everyone is hurt. There is no victor in war. But make no mistake, if I am not allowed to leave peacefully, I will NOT let anyone drag me down. I have gotten where I am by choosing my stakes to claim, choosing what path to walk, choosing what stands to make, and making them. This is my stand. I would perfer if this went no further, so no further damage is suffered to either side. That is, of course, a choice I leave you to. But if anyone starts trouble for me I promise it will be brought back upon you a hundredfold. I am choosing to walk away peacefully. If you choose otherwise, well let's just say I'm not someone ANYONE wants to see angry, least of all me. Because I know everyone will be hurt, no matter who ""wins"". This is my warning. Leave me alone. If I hear a word from anyone it had best be an appology. I care not for excuses, I care not for threats, I care not for half-baked attempts to hurt me, in any way.&nbsp;I am cutting my losses. I would hope you do the same. Drop it, go back to what you enjoy, and enjoy it. Seek me no more. I seek no vengeance of any, I seek no pain, no hurt, I seek only to walk away and forget... that is the wrong word... but it's the best one I have to fill that spot.. you all.&nbsp;

I ask only that you drop it, let it go, and go on with your lives, continue as you seem to have. I will stay away from you all... you stay away from me. That's all I want. Ideally we should neither of us hear of each other again, Rulmak, GG, Sabina. I hope what little blood you've drawn is enough for you, for you'll get no more without a price. Let it end here, as people I once called friend, I ask that. Let it end here and now, I have no desire to hurt anyone, nor to be hurt myself. Don't let this start trouble for us all, just let me walk away quietly.&nbsp;

"event","You know some things.. never change.

Some things do.

It can be funny to watch something that's gone on all of a sudden be erased and rewound, one can almost SEE the thought process. ""Alright, something got fucked up, Start over! I know what happened, it won't happen again...""

Here's my thought, and the idea FOR it comes actually from something put forward in Star Trek: Voyager. The temporal prime directive. What right do you have to change the past? For better or worse, what right do you have? People grow, they change, they develop, no matter how hard their past has been, they are the people they are because of the fact of that hardship. And we are not wise enough to know that changing a single event, or rewinding into the past with the intention of changing something would even do any good. The future could still be just as hard, just in a different way. We struggle our best the first time through to do things right, and if we fail, we fail. You go back in time you run the same risk, to make things better, or to make things worse. See Star Trek: Voyager - Year of Hell pt1 and pt2. It's a story about the Krenim empire, which had a ship designed to stay outside the space-time continuum, which has a weapon which obliterates entire worlds out of the fabric of space-time for all eternity, all the way back to creation. And learning what a BAD idea it was. Perhaps those who rewind time for their own benefit, would learn from a gander at this episode.

in an unrelated topic, I've been banned from a board by a man who called me friend. Ironic, isn't it? He asks me to go to his room to tell me I'll always be welcome in his room, that he still calls me friend. Yet I'm the only person I've ever seen banned from his boards. Now isn't that precious? Oh yes, and he reported me to Admin for something retarded that got me put on a level B disciplinary action for using my mod codes in a room talking about problems that do no pertain to the site. Actions speak louder than words. I think he was trying to get me fired. Good luck with that. I function too much by the book, it's not so easy, even for a lifetime member, to get rid of a mod. If he wants to cause trouble for me it will be short lived. I hope it does not go that far. I'd hate to see a good room on AR close because the RC got banned for harrassing a mod. I hope that now, he will leave me alone. I certainly have no intention of taking anything further with him. I could... but I have no desire to hurt him. Never did. None of what happened was out of spite or hate or vengeance. Despite popular belief. I'm just not wired that way. I just hope the wolf stops gnawing at his leg before he bites it off.&nbsp;

In a related note it's good to see em is rping again.&nbsp;

Oh yes, and foxy, my dog, went into the vets on wednesday, they kept her overnight to do emergency surgery in the morning for Pyometra, an infection of the uterus, which may at any time rupture and she'd die in minutes of endotoxic shock. Kind of like appendicitis. So she had to have an emergency spay. They kept her through friday, and now she's home. I'm happy to report the mass on her cervix they thought MIGHT be Cancer, was actually just scar tissue. Thank God."

"event","This is probably going to be my last entry here. As the reason why I came here is no longer a part of my life.

It's good to know who your friends are. You're right about that.

I guess I'm not.&nbsp;

I got angry, I let my mouth run away with me, and I hurt, and lost, someone I cared for. Correction, care for. As you said, words are a powerful thing. I am trying to be careful with them. But you have to remember I am not and never was a social person. I've only had any sort of social interaction for 5 or so years. Since I got out of high school. I had no life there, so yes, sometimes my mouth gets away with me. Sometimes I get bad with words, BECAUSE I spent so long not using them. I don't communicate well in groups, I get defensive easily, and I feel a compulsive need to fully explain any action I take against a person. Why? Because I like to be beyond reproach. I want people to realize over time that I did what I had to do. Why? Because I can't stand people hating me. Even those I don't like, or can't be around.&nbsp;

These qualities of me came together two days ago to make a mistake. Because I'm a dumb kid who ran off at the mouth as he likes to remind others can so easily happen to them. And you're right, I should have just said I can't be here and left it at that. But I choose the company I keep, and I will not keep it with him. I'm sorry I felt the need to explain, I'm sorry I let my mouth out of control, and I'm sorry I said what I did about you. So where does that leave me?

Well right now it leaves me jolly well fucked. Because you've been a friend for so long, a constant companion, someone who's always there when I'm getting nervous, feeling down, worried about someone, or worried about my health. And now you aren't there. Because I made a mistake. One I've appologized to you before, and I'm appologizing now. Unfortunately for me, the ball is now in your court. It's now up to you to decide what you do. I made a stupid mistake, one I'm sure no matter what you won't let me make it again. And I suppose that's good, that distance between us would remain a constant reminder that I need to watch what I say. At least I suppose so. After the mistake I made I don't blame you if you never talk to me again. I'm a liability. One you didn't know you had to worry about.

So what does that mean to me? I don't know.... I don't know why I care. That distance is always going to hurt so I don't know why I even bother asking for forgiveness. Having any proximity at all is only going to hurt more. I hate the way I am. see I care too much to do what's best for me. Invariably people get hurt. Invariably that hurts me too. I'm a self-defeating purpose. I'm an idiot kid who hasn't yet learned exactly how to live life. Sue me. So what if I care too much, so what if I make mistakes, we're human. I let my mouth get away with me I admit it and I appologize. That's all I can do. I suppose it's up to you to determine what my worth to you is. I'm sorry you got stuck in the middle. I'm sorry it happened in the first place, and I am even more sorry that I'm loosing a friend because dumbfuck can't keep his mouth shut. ((in case you're wondering, dumbfuck is me.)) I suppose I'll have to stick around a little longer... it'd be unfair to write this asking for forgiveness, and not wait to hear the response...&nbsp;

But either way.... I wish you only the best in life. You deserve better than what you've gotten... and you certainly deserve better than the way I treated you."

I had to deal with one of the scums of my life I'll never forgive last night. This guy, when I ran my Gorean home, was getting EVERY female of my home into MSN, including MY female, and would get them emotionally involved, then ask if he could piss on them. Let's not forget stringing along half of them in r/t, he was going to see one woman one week, then another woman the next. Fucking sick. He started bloody well arguing with me on the boards about the fact that he was banned from a certain room I roleplay in. dude, it wasn't even my call. If it was, you'd have been banned a lot sooner. So while you shouldn't be mad at me, you should be glad that it wasn't me. Then he has the audacity to sit there and name drop like it's going to impress me. ""Go ahead and tell Martin and Catnip and Wolfgang and whoever else is on sr. staff these days"" EVERYONE knows Martin is Admin's real name. That's like... the basics of the basics. Now if he knew Catnip or Wolfgang's real names, I might have been surprised. Still not impressed, but I would have been surprised. Or maybe if he'd taken the time to look it up and get the whole list of Sr. Staff. Then I could at least give him an A for effort. Right now he's just making himself look stupid. Congratulations MORON. So what'd I do? I name dropped back. *laughs* somehow I think he'll be less than pleased at having his real name on that room's boards. Oh well, Martin was less than pleased when his first hit the boards and rooms too, in fact, the word Martin used to be wordfiltered on AlterRealm, 8 or 9 years ago when it first opened. Now maybe the man will have a little more respect for the privacy of someone's name.

Because my mom has a vivid imagination. She thinks that if I clean out all the crap, the basement will be less a wreck. Funny, that, since 90% of the shit down here is hers, and hasn't been touched in ... since we moved in. There's 12 shelves off to my right right now that I could store things in, but from what I can see, there's a bunch of casettes, empty boxes, wires for things we don't own anymore, an electric organ with a broken key, a broken VCR, an empty motherboard box, a broken magnifying glass, a broken caraffe, something called ""Simple solution"" some books that haven't been touched in ages and should be boxed, a bunch of binders full of crap she likely doesn't remember is there... You get my drift.. a bunch of crap that should be in boxes, then I could put all my crap away. There's also a bunch of things that need to be thrown away. And I need to build a closet off of the wall somewhere down here. Why, you may ask? Because I'm a creature of habbit. And if I don't have my clothes just so, I won't do laundry. I have to have a place to put them.

So I forgot to sleep in this weekend... I'm going to wind up getting sick over this. *BLAH* I'll figure out something and recoup. I just need to make it a few more weeks until I get my check from Jimmy. Then I can just take out a weekend and crash. I really wish Jimmy would stop giving me more work until he finishes paying me what he owes.

Oh yeah, speaking of which I got a pair of magazines today I'm supposed to be creating ads for Jimmy in. Only I don't know what page would be his, which ad, what the dimensions are, etc.&nbsp;*GROWLS* Wonderful! And pay me the $520 you owe me FIRST. I'm not going to keep doing work you ain't paying for. This ain't how it works, dammit!

Happy mother's day to all you mothers out there, and to the motherfuckers, that counts. I'm hungry.... But I'm sick and I left the romaine I picked up over at davids... and it's so late... *GROWLS* I hate not eating on a proper schedule.

Oh, and I got in contact with em about twenty minutes ago, gave her a lil gift. I hope she enjoys. Also made a gag one for Matt... said ""Cuz I think being called a Motherfucker counts."" It's a long story. *chuckles* Anyway, seems she ain't at home yet, but she will be soon and I can only think there will be a much anticipated journal entry shortly thereafter. Wow, I really wish I could do with my life a quarter of what she's done with hers. *hugs to em*

good night everyone... good night journal. Good night Shaun. WAIT that's me... talking to yourself is a sign of.... OH THANK GOD! For a second I thought I was sane."

"event","Okay so I was rabidly pissed at my boss today. Yesterday I hear from David that Bill said that production is down and if he finds out the laptop is the cause of it, it'll have to be moved. <font color=""#ff0000"">Background: The reason Production's been down is because of our 11 X 17 Original Heidelburg windmill press, it's been pinching the paper, making it feather so much our Risograph GR3770 digital high-speed duplicator can't run it easily, it constantly jammed, and if you look back through my LJ you'll find plenty on how much I had to fight them.</font> Then today I find out from David again, that Bill got pissed because I had five books when printing the D280 books where the print at the top left side, where the recieving tray's paper arrangers block my view of the sheets, went over the edge. So they had to be trashed. And the only way I could watch it closer is by shoving my head INTO the recieving tray. That just ain't happening. So me and bill had a little chat. And actually he said he thinks my productivity has gone UP if anything in the last six months. We got things straightened up, and he'll be bringing his complaints to me from now on.&nbsp;<br /><br />The ST room... I love my son... but there's a certain someone who's just interested in sex... and as I said before, I come to fucking rp, not to rp fucking. I'm so sick of that. *sighs* and I'm a pacifist, but he wants me to keep abusing his character. I should just leave and be done with it.<br /><br />I love my Dawn. She finally joined LJ. I guess I browbeat her into it.&nbsp;<br /><br />OH, I want to go to Japan, see Fuji, and the cherry blossoms in spring too... I always did."

"event","okay, so I owe an appology to someone important to me. I inadvertantly insulted her. But let me be straight up, I do NOT think you're going to betray me. That was not what I meant when I said what I said, and you know who you are. I'm sorry that it gave you fits and made you feel insulted.

Last few weeks I've been pretty depressed, and it's hitting it's peak.... I hope... today... but instead of being depressing in my LJ, I'm going to try and find the things I am glad of. Let's see how many I can turn from bad to good.

Format: #a) Bad #b) good outlook.

1a) My boss pisses me off.
1b) I have a job.

2a) The riso is giving me fits.
2b) The riso runs. Somewhat.

3a) My Angel is 2000 miles away and I go into fits from withdrawals.
3b) She loves me, and I love her, and eventually we will conquer those 2000 miles.

4a) I've insulted a friend.
4b) She's still a friend.

5a) I'm getting old.
5b) I'm getting wise.

6a) lunch tastes like crap today.
6b) I have lunch today.

7a) I have to broadcast tonight.
7b) I get to broadcast tonight.

8a) I'm exhausted.
8b) My sicknesses seem to be fading.

9a) My arm hurts for no apparent reason.
9b) My arm doesn't hurt because there's a chainsaw in it. That would suck.

10a) My favorite game series newest installment isn't out yet.
10b) The beta for the newest game in said series is out next week, and david's going to let me play it.

11a) My paycheck this week is gonna suck.
11b) I'm getting a paycheck.

12a) Kim still bugs me.
12b) MSN has a block feature.

13a) I've earned myself a stalker online.
13b) MSN has a block feature. *lol*

14a) My mom drives me nuts.
14b) My mom loves me.

I'll try and make up more later.... I'm feeling a little better... hey that actually works... glad I told Karen to do that a few months ago."

A male RC who will sit there in another home as a female slave fucking the hell out of her Master with another member of his room, while I sit there in his room, alone, bored, pissed. That's right, I'm waiting to carry out orders and roleplays, and he's fucking some guy in another room. That's HIGHLY irritating. That's right folks, I'm right now sitting in the rp room I rp in, and there's noone there. And my main character is wounded. Or rather, malfunctioning. So he's just laying there, meanwhile the rc is off in another room fucking a man. Wonderful.

And then when he comes on he drags in another of my secondary characters, and then only to find out he just wants to fuck. NO. I come in to fucking rp, not to rp fucking. *growls* I'm just so sick of that crap. I'm full to the eyes with his shit.

Oh yeah, and my boss? Claims today that the computer is the reason why production has fallen off lately.

HELLO!? I've been screaming for two and a half fucking weeks that the risos haven't been WORKING! Look at my LJ! I mention it nearly every day that I'm fighting with the riso's to keep them running, and he KNOWS it. but God forbid any production issues be HIS fault. *grunts*

Star Trek: Lost chronicles - Back burner.

Jason, Lauren, Chris, Darius - Alive and well.

ST: NB - Fucking fun.

Borg - MEAN

Rulmak - Thinks I'm a bastard.... I feel accomplished.

so I'm at work all alone right now, well my boss and the sec are here, but David's gone. Why? He's recovering from a concert. Kiss my ass. He's a good friend, sucks ass as a coworker. I'm fighting the riso's like noone's business. they do NOT want to run this paper. I'm doing everything I can think of, fanning the paper, turning it over, turning it around, doing an indian rain dance except with the F-word instead of all the whooping... *grunts*

my Angel is MIA, probably out with Grampa and her mom. I broke my diet big time today, but I haven't eaten anything since lunchtime yesterday but one bit of cantaloupe, so I'm not too overly worried.&nbsp;

If Rulmak can keep being a captain, I can keep being a crew member.&nbsp;

Although I'm sad to loose the prospect of Darek Cindarion, but maybe I can make that work out here anyway. We'll see. So anyway, I'm going to get back to work, even though I finished my journal entry at 11:48 instead of 12:00 like I said, so it only took me six minutes, but I think that's a pretty good update in the world 'o' Shaun."

She watched me snap, and waited there through the whole thing. I snapped horribly, took me ... well I really don't know how long. Because the passage of time was kinda abstract at the time. And that's not the only thing that's changed.. but thank you for being there, tourist.&nbsp;

my little rp world is crashing down around my ears, and it's all up to the tunnel I've started to build to get me out from under it all. The single most present member of our crew is no longer going to be there because of the pain caused her by the rc. Whom just messaged me on MSN. Blah, like he really cares. He just wants pity for his months old headache. Talk to me when you hit eight years. Ten years. Fourteen years. Like mine.

My little tunnel? Star Trek: Lost Chronicles. A Soverign class starship (think the Enterprise E) that me, my Angel, and tourist were working on. We decided to abandon it while Tourist went to scottland, in hopes we could all at least pretend nothing was going on. That we'd be able to continue on without this room falling down around our ears. But that's inevitable now anyway. Besides, our RC has been isolating himself more and more from the rest of us since this whole fuckfest started. If that's what he wants, he can have it. He'll be left with Jura, who's in once a week at most, once a month regularly, James, who's in almost every night, but sucks at ST roleplay, and kit, who's his new little ladylove. So let him sit there with his shit RP and his isolationist ways, and we'll go have fun in OUR room. Where we get to make the rp, and involve everyone.

I'm tired now, my sleep was not restful. And I wonder how Dawn will take this. My decision to leave ST ... because I have nowhere else to go, will undoubtedly not be taken well. She loved Jessie and Jason... but Jason's dead now... I killed him. Or I will, he isn't actually dead yet, I haven't had the heart to kill off anyone yet. Darius... Chris....Jason... and Lauren.... ironically, Lauren is the most afraid of death. I would have thought she'd face it stronger than any of them, as afraid as she was of life. Oh well, Darek Cindarion will have to replace them. He will be closest to Jason I think, or perhaps chris. it doesn't matter. He's going to be different.

Tourist... thank you for being there when I'm down. You've been a fantastic friend.

Because there's too much of a curl to the paper because our Original Heidelburg 11x17 windmill press is putting too much of an impression into the paper it's perfing, which causes it to curl. And my boss won't get it fixed, and won't let me ditch the bad paper. Irritating idiot. It's costing him more in the time it takes me to figure out the sweet spot for this PARTICULAR stack that it would for him to get the thing fixed. BLAH.

Why do I consider to concern myself with those who are inconsequential to my life? Why do I continue to fight to try and help those who have hurt me, and been away, put myself into compromising situations for what? The little to no gratitude I get for extricating someone from a dangerous situation? To put in a little more information, my ex is playing in a room I've been watching for a while. Why am I watching? Because a friend of mine RP's there, not my ex, and I don't join the room, because someone there is very angry with me from my primary room. Anyway, I go in there to observe today, and my ex is labeled chattel to someone.&nbsp;

Now my ex is widely known for being self-destructive. In fact, the minute I broke up with her, she started talking seriously with this guy from online known WELL for being a... watersports fan... and believe me, that's not her type. After a friend of mine and I talked to her, she agreed it was best for her to break it off with him and seek SANE companionship. This guy was a well known stalker and two-timer, so yeah... bad news. Good idea.&nbsp;

I recently found out, that he came back into that room, he'd been gone for a long time, and I didn't even know it was him, and he was the one who claimed her as his slave. Naturally, I got defensive, I hate people getting hurt for their past mistakes, and I'm wiling to bend over backwards to prevent that kind of damage. But then I find out she's been talking to him in MSN again. Christ almighty, what is going through that girl's head? Stupid fucking mistake, and she knew better, so I told her, I'm not going to have ANY contact with her till she learns how to deal with that on her own.&nbsp;

And for those of you who answer yes... have you ever met someone you believed fully you just COULDN'T help? Either because they don't want help, or because their problems are just totally outside your ability to fix? Or even to help them. The statement, just being there helps, doesn't do a thing for me. I hate that phrase.<br /><br />It's noone's fault, really, but it's just a pointless statement, I get nothing off of just being there, and so it's impossible for me to really get any relief out of that statement either. It's a waste of your effort, and my time. Or maybe that's just my not feeling good. I don't know. I just feel... it's just been a rough week. And it's only going to get worse. One of my best friends is leaving town for a few days and will be out of contact, and this is someone I speak to every day. Last time this happened, I didn't speak to her again for months. But what do I care, everyone seems to think I really don't care what happens. Maybe I shouldn't. Hmm, interesting concept. I'll have to think about that one.<br /><br />Okay so we decided last night that the whole room idea is going on the back burner. So... *shrugs* I'll just build it up so I can roll it out at a moment's notice. Then in a pinch, we can roll it out and be online in minutes. That's how one becomes a miracle worker, not by exceeding what's possible, but by exceeding expectations. People's expectations of me keep getting higher... so I have to keep pushing myself harder to maintain my position where I am. *shakes head* the odd part is that the people closest to me DON'T expect anything of me. That's something I don't know how to deal with. I've always had high expectations of me. I don't know how to deal with someone who expects nothing. I suppose I'll learn.<br /><br />Anyway, time for me to get back to work.</p>"

"event","<p>Alright, so I was up way too late last&nbsp; night. Went to bed around 3:30 because I was worried about a friend of mine. She is having a real hard time with her roleplay. Mostly because of a certain person, who shall remain nameless, apparently becoming a user. He doesn't seem to care about her at all, anymore, and after making promises, and I find that reprehensible. I spent some time just worried about her, and some speaking to my Angel, Dawn, about all the things that piss me off in the Star Trek roleplay. *grunts* I spent probably a good hour and a half doing that. Yeah, last night was ... interesting to say the least.</p><p>My emotional control went all haywire too. Normally when stress like that rears it's head.. I either get angry and irrational, or my emotions die and I become infinitely logical. Last night, I started cold and logical, and then changed to angry, and that's when my thoughts started turning to the ST room and what irked me. I wish Dawn hadn't had to hear that, I was on a call via MSN with her at the time. I need to appologize to her. Again. But she was there for me, and it did help. So perhaps I should also thank her.</p><p>So here's my resolution for my current predicament. I'm going to open my own room on AR themed in Star Trek. I've got Dawn and Sabina are going to be joining me, and Dawn has a friend in her other room which will come to be a member of our room. I need to snag at least one new member. And then I'll have enough for me to go ahead with it. I still have to consider positions, because I don't think I'm going to do like Matt did, I don't think I'm going to assign senior officers to the first members in the room, I'm going to use NPC's until we get to the point where we can have people chosen for positions on merit rather than lack of option.</p><p>So anyway, I'm at work now, waiting for my lunch salad to get here, and listening to Flyleaf because David's making me listen to it. actually I just switched to Sevendust. Because I'm tired of listening to Flyleaf. I need more energy. I'm exhausted because I woke up at 7:30 as usual and had to call work and let them know I had a migraine and a sick stomach, slept more till 9:30, which still puts me at only 5 hours sleep. So I'm tired. and it's hot here. And about to rain. So the humidity is high, and the air pressure is lowering, which makes me only feel more tired. So, I'm gonna post this and get offa here.</p>"

"event","Wow, the last few months have been a flurry of activity. Actually it's been almost a year since I made a post anywhere. The massive number of posts you see on today are quite simply, copies of posts I made to my Xanga years ago. I couldn't figure out how to make the post dating thing work, so I didn't, I gave up on it and said screw it. I'm just posting them all to today.<br /><br />Okay, so around... oh.. January of this year, Kim and I broke up. It was a long time coming, and should have happened a long time ago. Actually we've broken up a few times in the meantime, but this was the first time of any significant length. As you can see, it's now April. So I'm on my fourth month of being seperated from her... and it's great. I don't worry about what I'm doing, or what my significant other will think of my friends. And yes, I do have a significant other. Dawn Castell. She's a security guard in Canada. She's supposed to be coming down here in about 5 or 6 months to meet me, and then I'm going up there to live with her. She's amazing, she doesn't care what I do with myself, as long as I'm not screwing around on her. And while she doesn't care what I'm doing, she still wants to be around me... but amazingly, she doesn't bitch me out if I'm not here with her every moment. It's liberating. I love her dearly, she's really an amazing woman. She's 29 and I'm 22, but I've been searching for a woman older than me for years. Because I'm more mature than I should be, and so I need to find older women who are as mature as I am. Kim wasn't.<br /><br />Wow, I just asked emdatourist if she was reading my posts or packing... and then one of her theme songs popped up on my playlist... creepy! Fiona Apple - Across the Universe. Though ironically, she still hasn't responded to me. Hmm... interesting!<br /><br />Okay, so I've actually resumed writing on my book. I think I've determined I'm GOING to start writing in it on the weekends. Because I wrote maybe another page and a half, and then haven't written again in weeks. So no, I'm not really coming along nicely, but it will once I finally start abiding rules on when to write, and when not to write.<br /><br />Oh, speaking of writing, I'm a part of a new roleplay on Alter Realm. I canned Gor, I'm not really that interested in it anymore. Cyruss the Rencer, who needs to remember to take his meds, cut off my char's arm and tongue for crap I said on the boards. Well, more accurately, things he imagines I said on the boards. A few months later, I'm sorta back, as Duhab, my old charachter's ship's captain. I'm keeping an old promise to Arako's sister, Sarina. But that's not the RP I'm really interested in. I'm in Star Trek: New Beginnings on Alter Realm... and I'm totally enthralled. emdatourist on here who dragged me here kicking and screaming, is one of my friends in that room. Actually she's more important than that. She's actually pivotal to every single one of my characters, of which I have *shhhh* four. Jason Brechman, a cocky helmsman, Chris Brechman, a transporter clone of the above who's on a pirate ship taking care of a family that got started when Jason was kidnapped by them and raped... well... kinda... it's a long story, go take a look at the website for that rp and look at my logs there, it gives a much clearer picture. Darius Pollux, a lunatic pirate captain, raised up as a soldier for Section 31, an agency that polices the Federation and is, at best, a myth at the Academy. And finally, poor Lauren Darksbane, sister to a genocidal maniac... okay so she's not that bad, but that's what everyone thinks of her as. So Lauren's been beat on, attacked, hated, starved, and generally mistreated for years. She's just starting to learn to be normal again, or was, until babe the blue ox and a woman she trusted and then didn't and soon will trust again barged into her life. It's so damatic. *le sigh* I love the room though, and the people in it are amazing. That's actually where I met Dawn. And she's made me inordinately happy.&nbsp;<br /><br />umm... OH! Yes, my work on Jack-Bilt's website got scrapped. :( but!!! I have completed a website for Jimmy Mack of Leadpro, and Master Mack Marketing. You can see my preview of the website at <a href=""http://www.minoguetech.com/members/Arako/Leadpro/index.html"">http://www.minoguetech.com/members/Arako/Leadpro/index.html</a> and soon I'll be uploading it to his server. *grunts* I keep putting that off, it'll only take a few minutes, really. And then I get to charge him like 350 - 450 for it... and I get my week made. And through Jimmy, I've met Leroy, of The Design Works. I'll be doing their website soon, and I anticipate 500-750 for that job. That'll be fun. WOOOHOOO!!! So I'm actually making money off of my design company again! Creative Design Concepts rises from the ashes like the Phoenix!<br /><br />Let's see... where am I going with this... hell I don't know, I'm gonna have to go and watch some episodes of Star Trek Voyager soon, or it'll start deleting episodes next week.<br /><br />OH yeah! And thanks to emdatourist, I'm on a new diet and exercise program that's supposed to be AWESOME, and is supposed to help me actually loose weight. I'm at 400 lbs right now, but I'm hoping to drop pounds like flies if she's right. THANK YOU SWEETIE! *HUGS*"

"event","<p>Okay, so I've been out for a bit, bite me. I don't go by Designer Spider anymore, that name was lame to begin with, it was just all I could think of. So life is cyclical and all things which were shall come to pass again. I STILL live in Raytown, still work at jack-bilt (though I'm looking for a new job, if anyone knows anyone who will hire me for more than 8.25 an hour, please, for the love of GOD let me know.) And I am still with Kim, though, that's been a bit rocky, but what relationship isn't?</p><p>I'm back into Gor, a realm I haven't been in since I was a horny little child going to look for a thrill. For those who don't know, Gor is a story based in a world where men are, by&nbsp;nature, dominant, and women submissive, slavery is common, and women&nbsp;are commonly reduced to slavery to pay off debts, or just because they got captured by the wrong person in a place they shouldn't have been without guards. It's roughly based in medival earth, save some things such as archetecture and medicine are highly advanced. Respect and honor still reign on Gor, whereas the earthen counterparts lost those concepts ages ago. Look up John Norman's The Cronicles of Counter-earth books if you want to know more ... okay so don't do that, you'll read three pages and go UGH this is horrible. go to <a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.alterrealm.com/"">www.alterrealm.com</a> and enter one of the Gorean rooms, preferably Mine, Kassau, and ask for the links to Luther's Scrolls, or perhaps just observe and learn by watching the roleplay.</p><p>I am, as we speak, installing the latest patches to Everquest, which I played when I was a little kid, and I'm just now getting back into. I probably can't afford the monthly fee, but hey, I can't go insane, now can I? Hopefully I'll get past level 12 this time, though I do still plan to be a Wood Elf Druid. </p><p>Let's see, I'm learning Paintshop Pro, actually I've learned about all I need to, there are a few things I don't understand still, like kerning, but hey, I've passed the first stage lessons of the avatars by design classes, and that's gotta count for something.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ok, so I'm getting tired of typing here and I need to check my bank account for the EQ download completes. (GOD, an hour + of download even at cable speeds!!! what in God's name?!) TTFN.</p>"

"event","<p>Okay, so now here I am a few months later... I have had a job since September... my birthday actually... at Jack-Bilt printing Inc. in Kansas City Missouri. We do a lot of trucking forms and such, and we make a lot of money for only having four employees including the boss. No offense to boss, but he's not got any good business sense... He's a nice man... a good man... but blissfully ignorant of his company. He keeps doing jobs for friends of his that never pay. (and not because he agreed to it either!) But I'm not worried about it. I got a raise faster than anyone in the sixty year history of the company, 3 weeks. I'm due to get another one soon, and another promotion too. Right now I think I have like 13 job titles, including .. dun dun dun... WEBMASTER! That's right folks, my first LEGITIMATE webmaster job! In a few weeks when you see all the pictures of our forms on the <a target=""_new"" href=""http://www.jack-bilt.net/"">www.jack-bilt.net</a> website in custom sized pop-up windows... yep, that's me. And later when you start being able to place orders all together online rather than one form at a time and it keeps a running total for you... yep, that'll be me too... and quite a bit of javascript. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, on the home front, me and kim are having a significant amount of problems, I don't know how much longer I can keep up with this.. one minute she's the perfect fiancee... she listens when she needs to, shows spine when she needs to... then the next minute she's biting my head off for shit that doesn't even affect her! Gah, whatever. Who knows how long we'll last?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I've been involved in a new roleplay lately. And I have enjoyed it, but it seems that my Mate in that roleplay is acting just like kim... only more violently against me... when She acts against me, she stabs me and throws knives at me... oh yeah, it's set in the world of Gor by Jonathan Norman. I'm starting to not enjoy it...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anything else? Oh yeah, Target's off my back now because I paid them off... wish it could have been done before that, but hey, whatever.. one less credit card.</p>"

"event","<p>I guess now is a good time to update, it's been a week and a day since I have, I'm not really into this, but it's a good way to get my issues out without forcing anyone to listen to me. The talk with Kim went great, blah blah blah... Ok, so the major event this week was that on ... I think it was sunday... maybe saturday, I think saturday, Kim had a huge fight with her mom over something really stupid, and she moved out. A matter of days later (tuesday) the backstage impressario had them making nice nice again, and had kim back into her house. I'm working really hard to make both our lives work, and everyone's against me on it. Whatever. Friends, Family, and all you other rejects out there that are against me: FUCK YOU! I'm going to do what *I* want, what *I* feel is right, and if you don't like it, then shut your damn mouth because I'm sick and tired of hearing it, and all it's gonna earn you is a swift kick in the nuts, or an IP ban from my computer, because I really don't need it anymore. I've been with her for three years, and that stuff is only really helpful in the first year or so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So now I'm on the phone with Target... who's calling me TWO TIMES A DAY about a $150 debt. I told them when I lost my job, but they keep calling me. I gave them money when I could, and they stole more from me, so frankly, they're not on the top of my lists right now. Oh wonderful, now they think it's ok to hang up on me. Guess what? Someone's not getting another DIME. They're getting an email as soon as I finish this update demanding a written appology from someone I think is important enough to satisfy my pride before they get another penny of my money, even once I DO get a job. I'm not above putting it on the line for a $150 debt.</p>"

"event","<p>Ok, great. So today me and Kim finally get to talk and work some things out. About time. But that doesn't stop me from being nervous... what if I say the wrong thing? What if ... blah blah blah, I have to stop worrying about that. Honestly, I think that yet again, her major issue is McCain. Which, as long as he doesn't come back into the picture, isn't an issue for me. I don't care about what happened, and frankly, I wish people would stop bringing it up. There's nothing more to be said. She cheated on me with a friend of mine. So what? That was two and a half years ago. I don't care. She's loyal now, and that's all that matters, right? I'm ready for this to fail at any time, so what's the harm in trusting her?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, yeah, it's great to be home! I haven't spent a day at home in a MONTH! It's a great feeling! I actually got to sleep in my own bed, spend some time with my dog, talk on the phone for as long as I want, noone came in and banged on my door at 9:00 AM... I just happened to wake up about that time. And you know, when you live at home, or alone, you really don't realize just how much you love being able to decide when you get up, what you do, how long you do it for. And thank God I no longer have a two year old constantly nattering in my ear. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So I spent some time with Keith yesterday, and it went well. We even went and shot pool. I have recently found out that I LOVE pool. And so does kim. And we will own a pool table at some point in our relationship. We MIGHT even play pool today. Who knows. We'll see. I love her to death, and I don't want to loose her, hopefully we can work this shit out. And from now on, my family needs to stay out of my business.</p>"

"event","<p>Well I suppose I can't say nothing's gone right today... I got a free trial of Xanga Premium... and I must say I'm rather impressed. I really need to figure out how to create skins because most of them suck. I'm rather partial to Celtic Green... whomever made it, good job! Ok, so I'm supposed to be moving out today... but I was also supposed to be woken up this morning by Dave Archiego. So that I could go to work with him. So that I could get an application. Guess what? Didn't happen. That means now I can either wait until Dave gets home to move out... or I can go ahead and move out, and see if someone can give me a ride back up here later. Crap, I don't know. But I said I was moving out today, so I'm moving out today. Once Kat gets a job, if I'm still unemployed, I'll come back and watch her kids for EXACTLY TWO WEEKS. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My friend keith wants to come over tonight, and I have really got no idea wether I want him to come over or not... he seems okay as long as Krystal isn't in town. And he is still my friend, even if he's lost the title of best friend. And who knows when I'll have another chance to hang out with him? Maybe he can even give me a ride back out here. But I really don't know what me and keith would do.. I'm sure, knowing him, that he'd probably buy me lunch or dinner or whatever, but even so, what would we do the rest of the time? I don't think he likes halo 2 that much, I don't really have any good 2 player games for the PS2, hell, I don't even have halo 2, kim has it! Well, maybe if I can get ahold of Dan I can borrow his copy, his dumb ass doesn't even have an xbox.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why is it that when you're broke and jobless is the time everyone decides to start treating you like a taxi service? My car has the worst gas mileage this side of california, I have no job, and a $-229.68 bank account balance, and last night, my friend Dan decided to ask me if I could drive him to his friend Dan's house. SHIT, that's a 10 minute drive! That's 1/16 or so of a tank of gas! (approx. .5 or .6 gallons) No gas money was offered, and I'm just supposed to bend over and take it up the tailpipe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh and lets not get started on my fiancee now. I told her the other day that I had nick's lighter that he'd lost a week before, because I found it in the back of my car, and he'd been sitting in the front seat, Kat, David's cousin, was in the back seat, so my assumption was that she'd stolen it. I, rightfully, got pissed off, so I pocketed it until I calmed down so I didn't start a scene. What does kim do? She lifts it from me, and gives it to him, tells him I was never going to give it back, or that if I did it would be a long time, and that I took it because he was so much of an ass about it. I swear to God if she keeps this kind of shit up, I'm going to have to leave her. First off, even if I had said that, you should show loyalty to your fiancee. Second, I didn't even say that, if I said something close, it's because we were in Target with him there with us, I didn't really have time to go into details. So the effects of this are that Nick may or may not trust me now, I may have lost a friend out of the bargain. I don't know.... what the hell ever.</p>"

"event","<p>ok, so I guess this is a bright, sunny, warm welcome to the world of the CRIMINAL. Thank god it doesn't appear we were caught, but tonight, my friend david and his dad asked of me to carry two trash bags out of the thousands that are building up in their basement because KCMO has a new law that says you have to buy a $1.00 sticker in order to have each trash bag beyond the third picked up per week. Then they made me hike half a mile across private property, climb a fence onto privately owned private property, and dump our trash into their dumpster. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Normally I suppose this wouldn't have bothered me. But then, normally, if I were to do something illegal, and I see two windows and a door with lights in them, in addition to the fact that I had no idea where the target was, I'd have turned around and gone home. End of story.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I love my fiancee kim, very very much... I'm so sad that I didn't get to play games with her tonight. but as always, nick and tobey was over, and neither one of them wanted to play games. And David would have had a fit if I went and did something by myself. He really needs to learn that I don't quite count as company here. And his dad still needs to learn that I don't quite count as living here. I'm going home tuesday... that's final. I just have to talk to dave and let him know.</p>"

"event","Ok, so I guess I'm new here, so I'll just start with what went on today. Let's start at the beginning. I got woke up early this morning after being kept up half the night last night to print off some crap for David's dad. I got commandeered to watch a two year old and a one year old. Now granted, that's what I'm here for. But this would make the first time this week that I've watched them, and I've now been staying in this house for three weeks, only one of which was I actually watching the kids. So needless to say, I'm pretty upset because I feel like my time is being wasted.

Oh, and what about this? The other day, Katrina, david's cousin, left the kitchen phone by the sink while she was doing dishes. So Dave, David's dad, comes up and yells at her, AND me for leaving it near water, and for not taking them back to the cradles. Ok, flashback time. A week ago, when Dave moved in, they took the phone out of the room I'm staying in. They moved it into Dave's room. There are currently three cordless phones in his room. As I stated before, I'm here all day, mostly because my car is a peice of junk. So that means that if anyone leaves the house, I am the last one to do it. So if there is noone else in the house, I'm still usually here. So I kind of need a phone around me so I don't have to run down two flights of stairs to see who it is. That's why the phone gets off the hook in my room. Every night, without fail, I took it back to where I got it. That or passed it off to someone else when they got a call that I answered. So he tells us that he's taking the phones out of EVERY room of the house BUT his, and then left one of his down here, and later explained to me that he was doing it to test us to see if we could take care of it and if we could, then he'd put the phones back. So here's my reaction... I don't live here. I have a home. I don't have to put up with the bullshit, and if you want to strong arm someone, you're barking at the wrong tree. I go home, you're screwed. See, up until today, he had no job, and neither did anyone else in the house. They all went up every day to this temp placement service, and usually came home workless, but even if they did manage to go out and get work, they make a max of $60. So that means if I were to leave, they'd make a max of 60. whereas they can make 120 together right now. Secondly, even though we did take care of the phone, I still have no phone in my room. Kat does. And that pisses me off because I'm a HELL of a lot more responosible than she is. She's a stoner!"

"event","This week I'm having a really creative artsy feeling that's taken over me. I've painted, drawn and now I'm cooking!!! 

I want to share with you the recipe that I made this morning called &quot;Warm Strawberry cupcake baked in a teacup&quot;. I also call friday's #Cupcakefriday's so watch everyweek for more recipes for cupcakes :) 

Makes 6 cupcakes 

Ingrediants: 
* Butter 8 tbsp, softened plus extra for greasing your teacups 
*Strawberry Jam 4tbsp 
* Caster Sugar generous 1/2 cup 
* 2 eggs lightly beaten 
* Vanilla extract 1 tsp 
* Self-raising flour (white) generous 3/4 
* Fresh Strawberries 1 tub 
* Icing sugar (for dusting) 

Equipment 
* Egg beaters 
* Teacups 6 
* Bowls 
* Spoons 
* Baking tray 

1. Preheat oven to 180 degrees C. Grease six heavy round teacups with butter. Spoon in two teaspoons of Strawberry Jam in the bottom of each cup. 
2. Put the butter, sugar in a bowl and beat until light and fluffy. Gradually add the eggs and beat well when you've added them, add vanilla extract. Stir in the flour and use a large metal spoon to fold in the mixture. Spoon into your teacups 
3. Place your teacups in a pan and pour hot water to cover about an inch of the teacups. Boil water before you start to to mix the batter (so you don't have to wait). Bake the cupcakes in the preheated oven for about 20minutes. <u>Cover your teacups over with tin-foil before you put them in the oven</u>!!! (I learnt the hardway!!!) or until they are golden brown (mine were very brown), insert a skewer into the centre of your cupcake to check if it's cooked, if it come out clean take them out of the oven.&nbsp;LEave them to cool for 2-3minutes, them carefully left them out of the pan and onto the saucers.
4. While you are waiting for the cupcakes to cook, slice the strawberries in half and take of the tops. After the cupcakes have cooled sprinkle some icing sugar onto the tops of the cupcakes to decorate and then place two halves of the strawberries&nbsp;ontop of your cupcakes as decoration.

They may turn out something like this:

I've learnt alot about you.
In turn, much about me too.
I travelled across the sea.
I wept for you, for you
emotions run deep between us friend
the time will come for us again
we're tired, we're tired now
this ship almost run aground
we'll lie and rest now
I'll dream of you
emotions run deep between good friends
But i do believe in us again
I've heard, i've heard it said
that love-real love has no end- a cup overflowing now
I will believe.
I must believe"

"event","evermore- Unbreakable (taken from the album Real Life, 2006)
You're a shooting star
That is what you are
You broke into my world but didn't get far
Cos we're looking for connection
A feeling of protection
And from where I stand
My only chance is you

We've got something
And I wish that you could see
That alone we're nothing
But together we could be
Unbreakable

Cos you're a shooting star
As I look from afar
You broke into this life and left a scar
Cos I'm looking for direction
Through mirrors and reflections
And from where I stand
My only chance is you

We've got something
And I wish that you could see
That alone I'm nothing
But together we could be
Unbreakable

If you feel like you're falling then
Come with me
I will try to give you all you need"

Its coming round again
The slowly creeping hand
Of time and its command
Soon enough it comes
And settles in its place
Its shadow in my face
Puts pressure in my day

This life well its slipping right through my hands
These days turned out nothing like I had planned

Its coming round again
The slowly creeping hand
Of time and its demands
It settles in its place
Its shadow in my face
Undignified and lame

This life well its slipping right through my hands
These days turned out nothing like I had planned
Control well its slipping right through my hands
These days turned out nothing like I had planned

Soon enough it comes
Soon enough it comes
To tie us down"

If it's okay
I'll leave the bed light on
And place your water glass where it belongs
And if alright
I'll lie awake at night
Pretending i'm curled up at your side

See i'm circling these patterns
Living out of memories
I'm still a long way from accepting it
That there's just no you and me

But if i still believe you love me
Maybe i'll survive
So i tell myself you're coming home
Like you've done a million times
And if it's alright
I'll still be loving you
'cause i can't break it to my heart

Is it just me
Did i commit a crime
I won't believe that loving you
Is just a waste of time
Or was it in my head
I'm reading into things that you never said

'cause i still don't have the answers
To why we couldn't work it out
I wanna think it's something that i did
So i can turn it back around

But if i still believe you love me
Maybe i'll survive
So i tell myself you're coming home
Like you've done a million times
And if it's alright
I'll still be loving you
'cause i can't break it to my heart

And nothing will come between us
I wanna convince myself we're perfect in
Every single way as long as i can keep
The truth away from my heart
Oh 'cause i can't break it to my heart

'cause i still don't have all the answers
To why we couldn't work it out
I wanna think it's something that i did
So i can turn it back around

But if i still believe you love me
Maybe i'll survive
So i tell myself you're coming home
Like you've done a million times
And if it's alright
I'll still be loving you
'cause i can't break it to my heart"

I don't know just what I'll do
Everytime you walk into the room
Oh my head is spinning around
And I can't see clearly right now

I'm wasted
I'm so wasted on you (x2)

I don't know if I'll survive
In this magical land behind your eyes
And there's all these funny little men
There all asking me to dance and sing

I'm wasted
I'm so wasted on you (x2)

Red and yellow pink and green purple and orange and blue
All of the colours I see my love everytime I see you

I'm wasted
I'm so wasted on you (x4)"

"event","Okay, here's the deal:

1. Leave me a comment saying, ""Interview me."" 
2. I will respond by asking you 5 questions of a very personal nature (or not). 
3. You will update your LJ with the answers to the questions. 
4. You will include this and an offer to interview someone else in the post. 
5. When others comment asking to be interviewed you will ask them 5 questions.

1. If you could learn another language, which would you love most to know, and what use would you put it towards?

I think I would learn spanish and french ready to go to europe

2. Do you sleep with your blinds/curtains opened or closed? Why?
closed!!!!!!!! i need pitch balck to sleep. Since I moved into Alexander's room, he has a galss door so it's frustrating when there's a full moon and it shines through

3. How many people can you honestly say you trust?

Only one, my mum. I can tell her anthing and i know that she won't judge me, there's too many judgemental christians out there who think that they're better than you, and i know that my mum won't go gossiping about it to other people, which i know a lot of people who if i did trust with my secrets or whatever, would go spreding it around. 

4. Who/what are you obsessed with right now?
I really don't know....umm...a band called the wombats, i love them, i 'spose they'd be my obession.

5. If you could be anywhere in space/time (including fictional places), where would you go and what would you do?
I'd go back and be Marie Anotinett, i really really would. I love her, i think it would be really fun to be her, even though she died from be-heading....still..."

i think i would open up my own fashion store/ clothing line. I weould love to design clothes that models would wear on the catwalk, and millions of girls and guys all over the world would want to buy and wear what i was creating. I think that would be amazing career because i would travel all over thw world seeing amazing things and talking to amazing people- sure fahsion is a bitchy career but aside from all the backstabing and bitchness it would be GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","ok, well i've been requested to do a write up about my trip to Canberra, so this is like a brief summary. Well, we drove down there, which took 5 hours which wasn't bad, then when we arrived at the hotel we got dressed again to go visit one of Mum's friends, Nadine. She is this really awesome bohemian woman that teachers ESL in like Morocco, and Vietnam! (even though she doesn't have a degree for it) she does it through the Australian volunteers something....i can't remember, but her stories were amazing, and i totally want to go over there and do what she's doing, 'cause it sounds so exciting! 
and the really cool thing is that she loves France so she had lots of French stories which were cool. 
Yeah, so also we went to the National Gallery of Australia, to see the "" Journey to the afterlife ( Egyptian antiques from the Louvre) at the National Gallery of Australia, which was awesome! it was really fascinating how the Egyptians lived, and worked and their really odd gods and stuff. And while i was there, i saw Mrs Brooks , which was strange at first, but then it was cool. Um...Next day we went to Parliament house, that was ok, i'm not really into politics so i was lost most of the time, but Mum wanted to see it, 'cause she said she hadn't been before. We went shopping afterward, and i got some amazing sales (score!) and then we were going to go see ""little miss sunshine"" at the movies but the it was canceled, so that sucked. And so i wanted to go swimming instead, but there were always people in the pool which was annoying. 
So, on the last day we went to the war museum, which was ok ( it really isn't my seen, but Dad wanted to go see it, so we did) and then we drove home. 
yeah, so i had fun, and got to go see the Egyptian exhibition which i really wanted to see, so it was all good.

hope everyone else is having fun, before we all start the new chapters of our lives soon (FREAKY!!!!)

love, Meredith xx"

Sometimes we don't understand our partner's requirements, or even our own. We all have a ""love tank"" that needs to be filled in order for us to express love to others, but there are different means by which our tank can be filled, and there are different ways that we can express love to others.<br /><br /><a href='http://www.youthnetsouthampton.org.uk/breakout/lovelanguages.php' target='_blank'>Take the quiz</a>"

i was eating a fourtine cookie, and the piece of paper read:

""No wind, no waves""

now, thats pretty ironic about the situation i'm finding myself in right now, i'm not going base my life around a piece of paper, and make it my world, but i thought that it was strange. I can just imagine God looking down at me, laughing or mabye scolding at me, saying syuff like: don't take it so seriously Meri, let it go, don't stress about a piece of paper. Or maybe he's sitting there laughing at me agreeing, saying HA! thats so funny, i can see were your coming from with that thought. 

I dunno. I just wanted to muse, so here i am. Actually, as i was eating my cookie i found some pretty funny stuff on the packet of the box. like, it says it authentic fourtine cookie, but it's made in Australia! And in bold on the top it says fourtine cook, whilest in smaller writting it says it's a novelty biscuite, HA!!!

dude, i should seriously get a life.

Silverchair - Across The Night Lyrics


Across the night
It was the moon that stole my slumber
Across the night
I fell in love with people sleeping
And hugged a man's arthritic shoulder

I fell tired, asleep in a golden ocean
Your eyes perspired, a spike in my fascination

I don't mean to make you cry
But this feeling will run right through the night
And I'll only make you cry with these feelings

Sleepless, untamed without a leash on the light around me

So let us be married and have another baby
Coz I don't wanna be lonely I just wanna be alone
Yeh let's just get married shouting baby, baby, babies
""You'll never sleep at all""
But I don't wanna be lonely

Never seen the sunshine
From higher points than sunrise
I don't wanna be lonely
I just wanna be alone"

Your Personality Type is:

INFJ 
 An INFJ is patient, giving, and insightful. They are known for their depth of caring, their loyalty, and their empathy. INFJs are philosophical thinkers who seek the greater meaning of things, and connect with the bigger picture.

They are very helpful, and enjoy making others happy. They strive for harmony in the world at large, and will often overcome their quiet, shy nature for a worthy cause, or for justice. An INFJ will work tirelessly for something he or she believes in.

INFJs are often described as Mystics or visionaries. They are rarely decieved by the facades of others, and can spot hidden motivations and buried feelings easily. Despite having this ability, an INFJ may have trouble making their own needs known to others, and with being understood.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INFJs are quite intellectual and well-read. They have a sly, ironic sense of humor. When they are comfortable enough with their surroundings to let it show, they can even be the life of the party.

INFJs are often very creative, artistic people. They find inspiration in their own rich inner life, and attempt to bring that richness to others through their creativity. Paradoxically, Many INFJs keep their creations closely guarded, for fear of ridicule.

INFJs, more than any of the other Introverted types, need an Extrovert in their lives to bring their insight, creativity, and intentions out into the open. Without an Extrovert, an INFJ will become unhappy very quickly.

Most INFJs have many hobbies. Their hobbies are an important release from the stress of being in tune with the feellings and needs of everyone around them. Hobbies afford an INFJ the quiet time they need in order to rest and re-center themselves.

They usually enjoy reading, and many INFJs like to write too. Topics that INFJs are drawn to include philosophy, poetry, mysticism, and metaphysics. They also tend to like cooking, gardening, and art.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INFJs are natural nurturers. They love to keep things running harmoniously and to ensure that their loved ones have what they need. An INFJ is concerned with taking care of everyone around them, and with taking up causes to make the world a better place. INFJs try to avoid insensitive, dishonest, or disingenuous people, but they will practically bend over backwards to accomodate everyone.

INFJs are one of the most kind hearted, gentle, and empathic types, but they tend to put up a wall around themselves in order to avoid being hurt. They only open up to a few very close, highly trusted people.

An INFJ is much more sensitive emotionally than any other type. Because of their sensitivity, they make very good counselors, and they have a special knack with young children. Many kindergarten and daycare teachers, veterinarians, and nurses are INFJs.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INFJs have very high expectations of themselves and others, and the same severe dislike of conflict that the all NF types share. INFJs are very modest, and rarely give themselves enough credit.

When they become emotionally exhausted or stressed out, they can start to show some of the negative qualities of an an ESTP, their polar opposite.

An INFJ is compatible with any other iNtuitive type. Their most trouble-free match in a relationship is either an ENFP (Extroverted, INtuitive, Feeling, Perceiving), or an ENTP (Extroverted, INtuitive, Thinking, Perceiving). An INFJ's worst possible match in a relationship is an ESTP or an ESFP.


Extroverts match best with introverts.


INtuitive personality types and Sensor personality types are a completely incompatible match.


Thinking and Feeling are neutral in a relationship.


A free spirited Perceiving personality type needs a buttoned-down Judging personality type to make sure the bills get paid on time, and the kids get their homework done.


A prim and proper Judging personality type needs a laid back Perceiving personality type to bring new opportunities to fruition, to stop them from getting stuck in a rut, and to keep them from taking themselves too seriously.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INFJs are the rarest of all the types making up only 1% to 3% of the population in The United States.

"event","on readin rosie's blog entry from like yesterday, i ofund something that may work. I dunno if it does, but it toally makes me feel better doing it, which is not really the point of doing it, but i love it anyway. 

So lately i've been writting emails to these people, that Rosie mentioned, all expect one- which i have no -idea what to write for. but basically i have been reading these really encourageing bible verse, which i've been emailing to certian friends. ( dude, talk about babling) but yeah, i feel totally encouraged and inspired by them, so i hope that the person whom i'm sending them to is as well. But whatever *shrugs* i might work, it might not, but hey all you can do is try and be there for them.

ok, so that's my two cents *puts two cents in*

I finally finshed you
you smelt like poo
no more sparkle, no more shine
your dull like a tree pine

verse:

what a plast from the past
from you, that will be the last
of me ever using you again
you are me worst fend
no more glitter
no more shine
you were never really mine
and now that your gone
i'm relived

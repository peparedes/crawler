"event","Well hello,been a right while since a proper update hasnt it.
Not doin anything tonight apart from bein bored and reading a boring book,Hard Times,the joy.

Didnt do anything last night either,arent i fascinating?lol but i did pick out songs to suggest to Mr Craig for me to sing,can't find any free downloadable sheet music for them tho,anyone with any suggestions for that,help me :)

DId go out on friday tho and it was a good night:D
Went to the odyssey with Paul,Johnny,Chris,Lauren,Paula,Carrie n Amy.
Our time for bowling got mucked up so ended up havin to wait till 10 to play,i didnt come last so i was happy:)To waste time we threw away some money at the arcade.I got my legs over a motorbike for 2 goes,i cant wait till i get mine:DAlso had two goes on the dance machines,but no1 would do the really fast ones so that wasnt so good:(But still fun,even tho at one time my left arrow didnt work so i was stomping it and it kept saying Boo! to me,not happy lol,air hockey and 10p machines were also a feature,along with Soda Joe's which was absolutely terrible.Paul and Carrie were given ice cream in paper coke cups,yes!The trampiness!

Anywho,photos were taken that i have to get a hold of,some nice ones:)And i found out today that Amy loves Bon Jovi!I never knew!Yay!And she likes Kelly Clarkson and various other good ppl and bands so woo love it when ya get someone like that that likes the same stuff as you:)Happy me.

Suppose i could tell you bout the share centre.was nearly 2 weeks ago but meh lol.I did archery,twice,and wall climbing,which i must say is grreat!My arms n legs were tremblin so bad half way up because of the strain and adrenaline i think,i wanna do it again!
The adrenaline was also pumpin when i was flying throw the air after jumping off a swing for amy to take a photo but it was abruptly knocked out of me when i hit the dirt with a smack.Oops..We loved that park just opposite our chalet.The roundabout were used A LOT!And im always up for a challenge.Especially when Amy pointed out one of the kiddies toys (the ones u sit in a nd its like a spring that can go back and forth) and said see if u can fit in that.Of course Amy was joking and even meant just to put my knees in it but i take it on and proceed so wedge myself into the thing,having to eventually pull myself backwards out of it,landing in the dirt.Aah,ur childhood antics never leave you.

Other things that happened at the share centre were ppl being very interested in the gloves i was wearing""DO you have climbing gloves?""""do you weightlift?""""Why do you have them on?""""Are those weightliftin gloves?""GRRRR theyre jsut gloves.
Haha i saw Claire play pool.When i say play pool i mean fire balls off the table,look all innocent when she doesnt hit a thing..and generally...it was girls playin pool,what can i say lol im not much better.
  We got to know the new guys Chris n Gary better while we were there which was good.Theyre dead on fellas,unlike a certain Graeme bell who was rather inappropriate at some points there.Yo dont know whether to slap him or just pull a cringing/disgusted face and go GRAEME!He really doesnt know how to talk to any girl like,u jsut end up thinking he's a giant of a perve.Other people i didnt get on so well with there were some fo the ppl we shared our cabin with,we'll leave it at that and ""She's such a BITCH!"" - Amy, and the leaving of a note sayin not to eat our food..fun fun.

This is turning out to be quite long,sorry,but its what ya get for havin me added as a friend.Nothin for ages then BAM i fill up your screen with rambling:D

Oh!i should be gettin my glasses 2moro,theyre pretty,pretty geeky but in a cool,funky way lol.Got the top of my ear pierced for anyone who doesnt know.I LIKE it!ANd may i say,once you start,piercings are addictive!I'm tellin you,the day after i got this done it was me thinkin,what else can i get done?I want more!I will get more over the course of the next few years,along with my bike hopefullly in the not too distant future.Aw,bikes,the thought of me on my bike,mmmm i will b in my prime,great stuff.All the leathers and all,phwoar,cant wait.

Anywho,think thats me for a bit.Will try n make myself read some more chapters.Please someone distract me online.
Oh nearly forgot!Concert for my mum's 40th.And yes it was my mum's 40th,last saturday.So,we went to the odyssey to see Delirious?Michael W.SMith adn Brian Houston in concert.They were all REALLY good.Had never heard of Brian Houston but he was great,so cute.He sang with his northern irish accent unchanged which was a really nice touch and generally,i liked his songs and he was hilarious.Next was Delirious,who jsut stole the show..

It all goes black,you see figures walking on through lime green lights and then just the bass and guitar line really strong and the place lights up with them all standing there in black suits.They are just the epitomy of ""cool""
Think their stuff might have been a bit heavy for some of the older oens i nthe audience but me n my bro were lovin it,they were just class.SO i got a tshirt and sweatband and am proceding to downlaod some of their stuff now.
Michael W Smith's songs were more crowd=based so we could all sing along to more worship songs.Was so kool,everyone knew them so e just flowed form one chorus of a song to another and everyone picked it up on the first beat,was klass.Such an atmosphere there and he's such a lovely guy.Will def go again if any of them come back:Dfunfun.

I've also found anew band i like;12 Stones.Heavier Christian band,me likes:)
Anyway,asi said,work."

"event","Breathe in for luck. 
Breathe in so deep. 
This air is blessed, you share with me. 
This night is wild, so calm and dull. 
These hearts, they race, from self-control. 
Your legs are smooth, as they graze mine. 
We're doing fine. 
We're doing nothing at all. 

My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me. 
So won't you kill me? 
So I die happy. 
My heart is yours to fill or burst, 
to break or bury, or wear as jewelry. 
Whichever you prefer. 

The words are hushed, ""let's not get busted."" 
Just lay entwined here, undiscovered. 
Safe in here from all the stupid questions. 
""Hey did you get some?"" 
Man that is so dumb. 
Stay quiet, stay near, stay close, they can't hear. 
So we can get some. 

My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me. 
So won't you kill me? 
So I die happy. 
My heart is yours to fill or burst, 
to break or bury, or wear as jewelry. 
Whichever you prefer. 

Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember. 
Always remember the sound of the stereo. 
The dim of the soft lights. 
The scent of your hair, that you twirled in your fingers. 
And the time on the clock, when we realized ""It's so late!"" 
And this walk that we share together. 
The streets were wet, and the gate was locked, 
So I jumped it, and let you in. 
And you stood at the door, with your hands on my waist. 
And you kissed me like you meant it. 
And I knew...that you meant it."

In that week i have worked,played,slept and ate.
The people i was with know what i did,i seem to be losin interest in writing it all down for my own benefit lol so i wont go into too much detail.

I'm dying my hair again tonight,hopefully its more violet,and stays more violet than the last time.

Chris' parents were away for a week so i stayed over there twice,was lovely not having to part from Chris at like half 12 like i usually do,much to the dismay of my sleepy mother.And then waking up and cuddlin up with him:)One of the nicest feelings EVER.
He made dinner yesterday,was rather nice,i was impressed.Especially with his dessert,(banana,apple,melon,orange juice and strawberry ice cream,scrummy).

Not long till Lee Evans now,woo!!Amy and my brother are gettin along rather well now,so ya never know what could b goin on there in like a months time,or more like 3 weeks..hehe,she's downstairs at the minute actually.DUnno if it feels weird or not,cant qutie decide lol think my mum finds it more strange than me.

Anywho,this is a kind of all over the place,jumping from topic to topic update but hey.
Spent few nights out with Paul,Lauren n all,mostly to SPringsteens and dandering.Love that bunch,always good times:)I bought a pen with a radio connected to it when i was out with them last,n sat n figured it out while gettin blown to bits at the wall where the beach bit is opposite kfc.
DOnt know when we're next playin badminton,but it better be soon,i have to beat lauren!A few of us are startin kickboxin,should be good,and tiring by the sounds of it but ya know,no pain no gain.

SO much for me not writing much,haha.Anyway,back to school 2moro,lookin forward to goin back actually,should b good year:)Mum's back from walking Max now so im away to dye my hair,hehe,better turn out alright.As Paul said,""Youre risking dying it the day before we go back to school??""Haha,yes,funfun.Ah it'll b fine,positive thinking lol byee then xo"

I'm gonna buy her ear plugs for her birthday,that should sort out all our problems:)

and i was on the radio today,again.Castle fm rang the shop and stephanie answered it,she couldnt hear anything over the fridges so came up to me o nthe counter and forced the phone onto me,oh joy.It was somethin called the farmyard hour and u had to make farm animal noises for a prize,i wasnt about to make an eejit of myself but thankfully 3 wee guys in the shop were willing to so all was happy and funny lol.I cheated but meh.The tshirt i won the other day is absolutely massive so Arlaine's partner Jim is gonna have it.I wasnt that fussed,can remember my amusing time talkin to whoever the dj is and having a laugh:)

I dont mind workin in subway now but as mum says,if i applied for tescos i could prob work some evenins whereas in subway it'd only b weekends,therefore prob less money if i stay at subway.SO might go to one of the open days tescos are holding with amy.

I'm downloadin music but sorta stuck for people to download,so any suggestions people?

<P><lj-cut text=""Here's my on-air story""><BR>Arlaine,the supervisor,was saying she entered a competition to win a dinner for 2 at the windrose when i arrived this mornin.So we were keepin an ear out as Castle fm was playin in the shop all day.She didnt win it,but one of her friends did lol.ANYWAY,she told me bout a competition to win a castle fm tshirt.All you had to do was be the 3rd person to ring in when the pebbles advert came on.<BR>SO when it comes on shes like ""oh there it is!give me the phone!"" SHe was only the first person..so she went to brush the floor n told me to ring again.I rang,""sorry,youre the second person.""<BR>""Arlaine we're the second caller!""<BR>""Well ring it again,quick!""<BR>*fumbles*has to dial number again.. ""Hello,just heard the pebbles advert""..<BR>They could tell it was the same person so hesitated and then were&nbsp; like ""congratulations,ur our third caller and youve won a free castle fm tshirt.""<BR>I was thinkin yay...then he goes ""i'll just put u through to mo now""<BR>And mo is the dj guy and i near died..i was like ""er..what?""Trying to signal to Arlaine 'he's puttin me through to mo,the dj guy,do u wanna do it?""But she wasnt gettin me at all!lol so then you hear the same thing down the phone as all over the shop...<BR>The dj did this weird ""lalala,dodo doo,ooh la laa"" thing and then said about the competition and said well if u know the shop where is it..?I said ""just round the corner"" and hes like ""haha jsut round the corner!""COnfusion then on both sides as Arlaine is tellin me to say ur from subway!and i couldnt make out what he was sayin so i said<BR>""well im in subway""<BR>and hes like ""AAhh subway!Was it you who made my lovely free sandwich here and all this lovely bacon?DO you usually put this much on it?""<BR>I said ""Nah the credit has to go to Arlaine,and mayb ur just a bit special""<BR>MO:""*laughs*glad you said that"" or somethin like that..<BR>I cant exactly remember what exact order this was all in but bear with me.At some point he said ""Now,this competition wasnt overly mentioned,jsut for our dedicated listeners so we didnt announce the number again.But we will now for the nest competition.In fact,Kirsty,you know the number why dont you tell them.""<BR>""That'd b 93355...(i said the right number cos arlaine had written it down but i cant remember it now)*<BR>""Weellll,wooww,think you could be a dj yourself.""<BR>""haha...""<BR>""Why dont you give it a go and announce our next song.Katie tuntstall - dark horse and the cherry tree""<BR>I had never heard of that song so while he was sayin about some 9 second advert introduction thing i was scramblin the write the thing's name down.Everybody was lookin and laughin lol it was great fun so i goes when he goes""fire ahead there..""<BR>""this is katie tunstall with dark horse and the cherry tree"".<BR>Haha and there was my radio debut in as accurate a recollection as i can give you.:) <BR>KAtrina came in bout 15 mins later and said ""you havin fun Kirsty?""She had been in woodsides or somethin and heard some of it lol.<BR>Apparently the guys at castle fm were ringing subway constantly the other day but nobody would pick it up cos when they did the radio guy was just messin them about and makin eeejits outta them lol.<BR></lj-cut></P>
<P>Well,back to waht ive been up to.On sunday night Chris came round and it was a lovely wee night,kirsty=well chuffed and grinny lol.</P>
<P>Last night went to play badminton with Paul,Johnny n Lauren again,think we're gonna make it a weekly thing.Was meant to pop in and say hery to chris when i got down there but i was runnin late n was afraid of disturbin him in the middle of a big lift so thought hey ill mayb see him later,which i did:) He came danderin round the corner after a while all pumped up cos he'd had a good day and lucky oh so hot so i dont know what he's goin on about feelin wick in front of my friends.I was thinkin,yep,thats my boyfriend,isnt he so damn sexy.</P>
<P>So after a few kisses,wee chat and chris lookin happy as larry he went again after a few wolf whistles which i must say put me right off for a while..and again when he did it later.Took me a while to catch on it was him the second time tho cos he was standin up on that balcony bit where you can see down over the courts.Of course it was bout 5 mins later one of the guys that worked there came down to us,looking at his watch saying ""em,we closed about half an hour ago..""</P>
<P>Haha,we got bout 2 hours for paying for 1 hour,crafty arent we:PIt was like 10 to 11 at that stage like but how were we to know,the lovely robbie williams cd was still playin.</P>
<P>We arrived outside to see Chris n Shearer sittin on one of the benches,was nice seein him for that wee bit even if i did look a state im sure,at least it was dark lol.Didnt have long tho,got picked up like 10 mins later.Butnaywho,good last 2 nites,cant rmember what i did on saturday lol,oh wait i saw Chris after i cam back from holiday,thats it lol make that 3 nites and prob 4 after 2nite as mr chris is comin round 2nite i think:)</P>
<P>Fun,fun,and ill leave it at that.xxo<BR></P>"

- Went to Fermanagh for a week
- Granda's trapped a nerve in back so was on 3 types of really strong painkillers all week
- My doped up granda likes to embarrass me by lookin at page 3 in a restaurant and saying,""What?What has she got that you havent?""
- Same doped up granda was left on his own while rest of us went shopping.We came home and he'd managed to break off half his front tooth on a biscuit,but he couldnt remember this.
- He also broke the deck chair is was using to lie down everywhere.I heard a crakc nad thud and went out to find him on his back on the grass outside with a slightly dazed look in his face.
- Doped up grandfather decided to take the car with noone knowing up the lane to get a signal.
- He didnt come back for quite a while so a rescue party was issued and arrived back and his car was bellowing smoke.The clutch had burnt out.Though that wasnt his fault.
- So that car was undriveable and had to use ours rest of week.That was,until our exhaust fell off.
- How unlucky.
-Granda still hasnt got his car back,he's still doped up,our car now has a pipe welded into it to hold it on but we arrived home safely and it was an hilarious holiday:)

There we go,long story in shortish form:)As i said,our family holidays are never uneventful."

"event","Back when I was a child,
Before life removed all the innocence,
My father would lift me high, 
And dance with my mother and me,
And then...
Spin me around til' I fell asleep,
Then up the stairs he would carry me,
And I knew for sure I was loved


If I could get another chance, 
Another walk, another dance with him, 
I'd play a song that would never never end
How I'd love love love...
To dance with my father again.

Ooooh...

When I and my mother would disagree,
To get my way I would run from her to him.
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me,
Yeah yeah...
Then finally make me do just what my momma said.

Later that night when I was asleep,
He left a dollar under my sheet.
Never dreamed that he, would be gone from me.

Repeat Chorus

If I could steal one final glance,
One final step, 
One final dance with him,
I'd play a song that'd never never end.
Cause I'd love love love, to dance with my father again.

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how my momma cried for him
I pray for her even more than me...
I pray for her even more than me.....

I know I'm praying for much too much,
But could you send back,
The only man she loved.
I know you don't do it usually,
But dear Lord she's dying, 
To dance with my father again.

Every night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream..."

Worked yesterday from 10 till 7,wasnt too bad and i made whole sandwiches all by myself and think ill finally got the hang of the till:)Thankfully the day passed prety quickly n i just watched tv and relaxed the rest of that night.

Today i went to the gym with Chris.SAw Paula jennie and jonny down there too.Haha poor jennie has come to the realisation that she doesnt like the gym,it hurts lol.I'll agree that it hurts but i wont say i dont like it.Will be lookin forward a lot more to cardio tho lol wasnt too bad but my legs have gone from beneath me several times in the first hour since i got home and can still feel the tension or whatever in my arms when i lift them.
I really am sooo tired.My eyes are all heavy and i spent the time after the gym in bed for a bit.Yes im a wuss but it was my first real exerise in like 2 months because of the exams so meh.Dont knwo when im next goin again but hopefully not too soon lol

Its roastin up here,have to go turn the heating off and hopefully Chris will appear with his damaged foot.

Loves her mum and her dad, the only secure that she knows
But at night, she's alone, she's dreaming of somebody new
Her someone for to hold, she's praying the dream will come true

Show me the way - show me, show me how
help me be brave - for love
Show me the way - show me, tell me how
What do you say?

There's a pain in her heart, she's trying so hard to unwind
makes her cry in the night, when visions so real make her blind
Wants to break through the fear
Erasing the scars from within
Start a new kind of being - she's down and she's praying again 

Show me the way - show me, show me how
help me be brave - for love
Show me the way - show me, tell me how
What do you say?

You see she's 
Turning the key, unlocking the door
Embracing the rollercoaster world
Stepping outside, body and soul
Taking whatever future holds
Turning the key, unlocking the door 
Embracing the rollercoaster world
Take it in stride, you're just twenty-five
You know we've all been hurt before
(Repeat)

You know we've all been hurt before
So you're not alone
So you're not alone"

Haha emoticons are great. {h} (I know what its of:P,so does chris,hehe ;) )

Listenin to Switchfoot..haven't really listened to the albums of theirs that i got.Nice listenin to..

ANywho,suppose i may tell you what i got up to this weekend.
Friday i went out for dinner to Springsteens with Claire n Amy,was lovely.After dinner we walked along the shorefront n sat on a bench n talked while watchin the sun go down.Was oh so pretty,cant remember the last time i watched the sun go down:)Amy had to go so Claire n I walked back to hers n became camera whores :DWe mustve taken about 15 pictures,hehe was funny tho.We look like such happy bunnies in some of them.Which is always good..

Today i mulled about till bout half 3 then went to work till 7..Was perfectly fine today,gettin the hang of things now.Walked up home with mum n max which was nice.Gotta love these summer nights.

Think thats about it.Apparently i should be gettin to bed now.Meh,ill stay on till shes actually ready to get in.This day jsut disappeared in the blink of an eye.When i get up in the morning ill be headin straight to work for 9 HOURS!!Eww but workin with AMy so shouldnt be too bad.Still,hopefully time passes quickly and there arent too many people in.I'm perfectly happy washin dishes and preparing food in the back.

That reminds me,there was this moody middle aged couple in today adn i was doin the till..Well for the life of me i couldnt open the plactic bag to put their subs in!!I tried n tried then had to take off one of my gloves to open the damn thing.Tried to laugh it off sayin ""Haha doesnt seem to want to open""They just looked at me with this sour look.Maybe the guy gave me the slightest crack of a smile but it was like the mona lisa where u not quite sure if she's smilin or no.meh well there was this other cute wee granny so that made up for it:)

I like it when people update and i have somethin to read*nudge nudge* :P

(8)School's out for summer!!(8)

Was leavin books up to Mr Shaw's after the exam but mr irwin was in there.He was trying to persuade me and Claire to do Business Studies again next year,apparently we should get As or ""hopefully a wee star on there too"" lol gotta love Mr Irwin.His wee baby made him sick so he's been off for a while,awww...He has such a cute wee personality lol if we were assured we'd get him we'd be more likely to do Business lol his classes were great.I don't get why anybody doesnt like him,he's great!:)

ANywho,saw Suzy!!She was in sorting out classes with teachers for comin back next year i think.SHe's goin back into year 12 but she can come into the Jamison room with us next year.Aww was great seeing her after so long!Surreal,but good:)SHe says she wants to start gettin her life back so we were all inviting her places lol didnt realise how i missed her but suzy is suzy,love suzy people!:D

Could be two weeks till Claire is back to 100% but we're goin to Springsteens tonight for dinner and some lovely dessert i hope so yay:)We have to go ice skating sometime!Definately.Have to do somethin with everybody this summer,go places,have fun,party,anything!If the weather wasn't so glum today id come out with this is gonna be a great summer so it better clear up and i can feel more like sayin it.

Amy doesnt like subway,i feel for her,seems she got a crappy shift on wednesday just constantly cleaning.Hopefully can make up for it on sunday when we're working together and shes there fore when more of the customers are there and will have someone to talk to.SHe was working with Ian and think he's really shy so they didnt talk much so that added to her not thinkin its great.I'm sure she'll feel better when she gets paid lol

Just thinkin here..how much has suzy missed about us all?Will be good catching up when we get a chance too.

(8)It can only get better..(8) from here:D

Now,i have one massive apple to eat,mmmm.Don't think ill go to Sozo with paula n all this afternoon,afraid of not havin enough for springsteens and the weathers horrible for walkin..Am sure ill see them very soon so no worries.ANytime i say about working in subway people say ""oh you can get me free food!""Haha no,im just a poor little trainee but ill try to sneak ya a few extra stamps;) Ssh..

Anywho,off i go.Lookin forward to this summer.Goin out with friends,Chris,going out some more,gettin money,shopping and wahtever else comes along.Aahh all is good in the life of Kirsty xoxoxoxoxo"

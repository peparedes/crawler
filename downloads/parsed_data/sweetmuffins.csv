"event","ok this will be the last entry to this journal. this no longer is for me. i will more than likely get a new lj 2moro but this will be the last entry on this one. instead of being lame and saying something like...im over lj (which im not) i thought it would be a good idea to have my last entry have a lyrics thingy. so here it goes...

1.right now this town really fucking tears me down

2.got some shit off my chest put on my back next to the monkey nest

3.With your cute little smile and your silly laugh, God gave me love at last 

4. fredom was her name...where did she go

5.before i have to be pullin this hush puppies out yo muthafuckin ass 

6.i take a look at my parents and see how they scream and fight

7.I called in sick to work today and stayed in bed till noon

8.Today I woke up,More awake than I have felt in years.Not consearned with anything, no tears.Well I'm done with that shit.

9.You have to be the cutest gravedigger I've ever seen. 

10.Much rather be drinking anyways With my friend Peter

11.So, I mean, here we go But there ain't no escape No, these streets they're just dead ends.

12.were you intoxicated past the point of knowing what was going on

13.I love the feeling that I get when I strike thats the only time I feel alive

14.It's been 37 years since James died on St. Patrick's Day in 1964 

15.Maybe I'm a dreamer, cuz you're type don't dig my type. 

16.I think I'll miss her, even though she tried to kill me, because she was the most prettiest girl that I'll ever see. 

17.they said you were the freaky kid. when you were in school

18.Solo mis amigos me pueden aquietar Porque yo soy el mas chingon

19.So here's to the passing of all that could be between you and me 

20.A hat to push away the rain, that would be okay.


ok so that concludes the lyrics game thingy... it will be up for prolly the next day or so, so everyone participate. when i started this post i said it would be the last but its gonna be the second to last since i gotta post the answers...dumb me!"

"event","so yeah today was ok iguess. went to work got sent to memorial spent most of the day doing nothing. dont get me wrong theres always a ton of shit to do but i mena i kinda wasnt in the mood to work. i just just installed an operating system on a few machines. so yeah after work jason and george came over cause we were gonna paint my room. we were thinking we might get it done in a day but i put this project together today so it wasnt really planned out.but yeah i guess its looking good so far. all i got left is a second coat and the ceiling and all the trimming but i think david will do the trimming 2moro so that should look good. afterwards my friend mark called me. and no its not mark from the air force but an old buddy from bby. so yeah i went over to his house looking and smelling like shit. but he didnt care. my buddy jason came over too and me and him played halo 2. i must admit it was fun playing the co-op but i mean i dunno i still prefer my pc over xbox any day. i just cant stand the controls. but i guess its an alright game i guess. we were talking about gettin me an xbox and modding it out. this would be the 4th xbox i have so im kinda undecided about buying it but its cool when its modded cause it has more use. im going to a LAN this friday so taht should be fun. my friend wants me to get him smirnoff so imma hook him up baby d style and im also taking some amarreto and some hypnotic and of course some pucker!! but yeah...

so i found out i offended someone today and that totally was not my intention. i mean at times i wonder if i shuold be more serious like act my age and stuff but i dunno. i mean i really didnt mean to do it but i did it so i guess theres not point in apologizing although i already have. but yeah i guess from now on ill try to be more serious.

"event","ok well i was thinking about mark today is this one song i used for my decades project back in AP history popped into my head. i kinda rewrote it. the name of this song is...I feel like im fixing to die rag by country joe and the fish. didnt really change a whole lotta words but youll see why.

Well, come on all of you, big strong men,
Uncle Sam needs your help again.
Yeah, he's got himself in a terrible jam
Way down yonder in iraq
So put down your books and pick up a gun,
Gonna have a whole lotta fun. 

And it's one, two, three,
What are we fighting for ?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn,
Next stop is iraq;
And it's five, six, seven,
Open up the pearly gates,
Well there ain't no time to wonder why,
Whoopee! we're all gonna die. 

Yeah, come on Wall Street, don't be slow,
Why man, this is war au-go-go
There's plenty good money to be made
By supplying the Army with the tools of its trade,
Just hope and pray that if they drop the bomb,
They drop it on the rag head. 

And it's one, two, three,
What are we fighting for ?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn,
Next stop is iraq.
And it's five, six, seven,
Open up the pearly gates,
Well there ain't no time to wonder why
Whoopee! we're all gonna die. 

Well, come on generals, let's move fast;
Your big chance has come at last.
Now you can go out and get those rag heads
'Cause the only good iraqi is the one that's dead
And you know that peace can only be won
When we've blown 'em all to kingdom come. 

And it's one, two, three,
What are we fighting for ?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn,
Next stop is iraq;
And it's five, six, seven,
Open up the pearly gates,
Well there ain't no time to wonder why
Whoopee! we're all gonna die. 

Come on mothers throughout the land,
Pack your boys off to iraq.
Come on fathers, and don't hesitate
To send your sons off before it's too late.
You can be the first ones in your block
To have your boy come home in a box. 

And it's one, two, three
What are we fighting for ?
Don't ask me, I don't give a damn,
Next stop is iraq.
And it's five, six, seven,
Open up the pearly gates,
Well there ain't no time to wonder why,
Whoopee! we're all gonna die."

"event","ok ok today was prolly the most horrific day ive had ever. im basically gonna explain what happened and most of you will not understand wtf im saying and the ones that do are lying...

Spanning-Tree Protocol is a link management protocol that provides path redundancy while preventing undesirable loops in the network. For an Ethernet network to function properly, only one active path can exist between two stations. Multiple active paths between stations cause loops in the network. If a loop exists in the network topology, the potential exists for duplication of messages. When loops occur, some switches see stations appear on both sides of the switch. This condition confuses the forwarding algorithm and allows duplicate frames to be forwarded.

so basically spanning tree is supposed to prevent loops in the network...or so it seems. we dont know how or where but we do know it was sometime this morning someone plugged a crossover cable (568a on one end and 568b on the other) into a port somewhere in shoreline. that basically sent spanning tree into a loop which built up and caused denial of service on all our cisco 3550 switches. thats about 60 switches. so for most of the day we were trying to find out where this happened.we had to manually reset all those switches which was really fun!!! so yeah cisco couldnt figure out how to fix it and theyre the ones who made the damn switch. so needless to say i loathe spanning tree with the passion of the christ!! it was a long day at work but thats ok and im on call tonight so that means ill prolly get called in or something or other.it coo though i dont care and i eagerly await what tomorrow will bring.

so here are some pics of waht im talking about

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v101/sweetmuffins/s5691.gif"">
 i would go more into detail but that would confuse the shit outta most of you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------i completely forgot!! some of you might be wondering why the hell we use spanning tree. well... our NOS (network operating system) novell, has gotten to the point where we can install winxp pro of the network. basically thats why we use spanning tree. damn novell zenworks, damn u in the butt!!"

I've met some people along the way, some of them split some of them stay, some of them walk some walk on by, I've got a few friends I'll love till I die From all of these people I try to learn, some of them shine some of them burn, some of them rise some of them fall, for good or bad I've known them all We live our life in our own way, never really listened to what they say, the kind of faith that doesn't fade away we are the true believers well you can fight or you can run, under a rock till the war is won, play it safe and don't make a sound, but not us we won't back down true believers all the way, you and I

last night:
me and jeremy went to tgif and ate there tehn went to bby. ran into luther there *hes soo hot!!* err i mean yeah hes a cool guy. anywho he was gonna buy the aladdin movie for his chick and they were giving away a monkey with it apu i think his name is. so yeah they ""were out of monkeys"" so i saw a display one at the front of the store so i ran up there took it ran back to luther and gave it to him. the new employees were like sir u cant do that. luther started mumbling and i was like im Baby D dammnit and then some of the emps who knew me said to let us do what we want to the FNG's. so yeah jeremy and me said bye to luther and headed home. outside the store luther was parked near me and there was carts nearby *lightbulb* an idea came to my head!! i was like hey lets sourround his car with carts to jeremy and well here are the pics from it

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v101/sweetmuffins/40194162693.jpg"">
one cart two carts green carts yellow carts!!

""yo man i didnt do shit""

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v101/sweetmuffins/40194163973.jpg"">
end result: both doors and front and back of car sourrounded by carts

so i went home after that got online and yeah... played cs a while. talke to amy and i think things are back to normal? i dont think they will ever be the same but i think its as close to normalcy as its gonna get so im happy for that.

went to wally world at 1am to buy toilet paper and other stuff but i got enough toilet paper to last a few months. i figure stock up now so i dont run out later.

saturday:
woke up and went to my friends blas's house to setup office 2003 on his comp. after taht i went with my sis her husband ma niece and ma bro to red lobster i think i saw amanda there but im not sure. so anywho yeah went home then went to king and played soccer. it was hella fun!! i kept hitting the crossbar but i did make some shots that would make beckham envious. but yeah i went home after that and chris and najj called so i went with them. we saw the village and it was ok kinda dumb though but whatever. and yeah apparently i flirted with the girl on the concession stand? i dunno but i thought we had a good convo i guess. wouldnt mind hanging with her. something about her incoherentness is funny. but anywho i convinced najj to get an lj and her sn is gonna have cheetos in it so thats cool. so anywho yeah it was the first real time i hung out with friends this week. srry to all those who i flaked on this week i was being gay i guess but whatever im ready to get ma freak on oncemore or something or other like that. but yeah bad religion next week so im pumped for that. i dont think anyone else is going though so that suxors... oh well i guess im going to w00t w00t!! but anywho i guess thats all for now.

oh yeah kayla (my niece) took my alkaline trio cap and put it on. she looke soo cute!

"event","so i was gonna post something really inspirational but as soon as i got home i drew a blank... werk was ok for the most part. again i did nothing really and im starting to worry cause i think theyre gonna catch on soon and im gonna get in trouble. ill werk hard tomorrow. went to the gym oncemore and im starting to feel like if i dont go my day isnt the same so thats good i guess. ive lost 8 pounds in one week of going to the gym. anywho, today everyone flaked except ceasar but he was gonna play racketball so i got stuck alone again. oh well i did a good jog walk thingie so i was ok. i dont like doing weights unless its with a partner i dunno why i just dont. got invited to go out to eat but i didnt feel like it so i made a few people upset? srry if i did. i ran into gina and alana at the gym again. gina as usual makes me laugh with her ""BABY DEEE!!"". but yeah i sit here now and i think imma play some cs cause no ones playing CoD so i guess thatll be all. god damn im soo hungry. if only i knew it would come to this would i have ever done it? *poof* well im out"

"event","yeah so werk was werk today. nothing special. did a lot of nothing. took a walk down ocean for a while in the morning. took a long lunch. my wrist hurts. not what yall think. cut it up pretty bad but whatever rather not go there. came home early. no gym 2night cause i really wanted to walk but with the rain i guess i wont be going.  i might go joggin 2night... actually imma take a bike ride! and yeah i took care of ma ticket i think. well i sent it in and called and they said i was still ok so well see... gotta clean ma room. christina and najjala came over last night and i didnt wannna let them in cause i have a mess but ill prolly clean that 2night. played cs a lil while but ma mind wasnt in the game so i barely broke even. will play again 2night and possibly some CoD too.


so i have a minidisc player. ive had it for a year but i never really used it. im gonna find the software for it so i may use it again. but anywho yeah imma go get on my bike and take a ride...who know i might swing by your place! i doubt it but it could happen. my idiocy is only surpassed by my brilliance. everyone is kinda far from where i live so who knows how i feel."

"event","tossed and turned all night and didnt sleep. dammnit to fucken bloody mormon hell!! woke up with a growling tummy yet the sight of food makes me nauseous or something like that. anywho yeah ill be at memorial so i should be reacheble at either number and in case i dont answer plz leave a messege cause it wont tell me who called it wont even say missed call and thats on both phones so... in other news i think im heading to the gym after work and if anyone wishes to join me today go ahead and gimme a call i got a couple of one day passes so just lemme know ill be going around 5:30 ish or so and i wont be leaving till around 7 or so. yeah im not so sure about HWM at the end of the month. marcus said he would go but hes broke so i dont really know anyone else that likes em enough to wanna drive to austin so i guess ill prolly just chill here for those two days at the end of the month. oh yeah i found out my mom comes back the 20th so that should be ok. is it bad to say i was used to not having her here? oh well this post is getting kinda long so i guess i better end it soon. lots to think about yet not enough brain to do it with... i have no regrets though so i guess im good."

so today kinda suxored but i guess it was ok. clocked in at 5am and clocked out at 6pm. i worked alone at memorial so it was ok. fixed ma laptop there. after werk i called chris. its been a while since ive seen him but whatever he called so i returned the call. i went to the gym afterwards and well i didnt do what i wanted to do but i still had fun. i did a 3 mile walk,jog,run,sprint. i felt really good i managed to do that. i lost 3 pounds last week so w00t w00t i guess. oh yeah i know how we all fuck around and talk shit but plz no more fatass jokes. i am what i am and im fine with it but i mean whatever ill prolly get joked over me going to the gym but at least now youll know why ill get pissed so at least now youre all warned.err whatever i dont give a shit what anyone thinks im doing this for me and no one else. so if i loose weight great and if not thats great too. but i will prolly end up losing weight so whatever. anywho i guess thats all for now. im fucking tired as fuck and i think george and jason are coming over"

"event","The plexiglass was approximately 2.5 cm thick. Not quite thick enough to cause clouding and distortion, but thick enough to keep the encaged orangutan from sodomizing the nervous scientists or doing some other outrageous act that would warrant the protection of 2.5 cm thick plexiglass. 
      Bongo had been in that cage for 17 months. Pulled from a flash flood in Zaire, Bongo, whose perception on his rescue is so far undecided, was rushed to the nearest missonary hospital and treated for being an ape. In short, Bongo had undergone rigorous experimentation in an attempt by despotic scientists to humanize him. He was taught words and expressions, and had a limited ability to understand himself and the world around him - about at the capacity of a 13 year old girl, the scientists conjecture. Bongo had even been given a hearty dose of genetic alteration that increased his desire to learn and his ability to understand teaching methods.  However, Bongo had one serious problem. 
      ""Oh, Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling...""
      ""He's singing again. Christ, that's annoying. Get the hose.""
      Stemming from some unstudied function of cranial growth inhibitors, Bongo's brain had learned itself into a rut. He knew hundreds of words, however, he could only express them in phrases and quotes from ""Danny Boy."" The scientists were boggled and frustrated, and were on the verge of giving up hope for Bongo's progression. They cursed the record O'Brien had brought in that first Tuesday of Bongo's musical comprehension testing, and subsequently O'Brien had been fired and died in a suspicious car accident. The singing really got on the scientist's nerves. 
       A week later, the scientists had completely lost interest in their orangutan project. Upon a brilliant suggestion, Bongo was released into the Bayonne, New Jersey, to fend for himself, and hopefully get hit by the metro. The release was completely unconventional and un-Goodallian; Bongo was put into the back of a taxi headed for the nearest congested bridge. The scientists all signed a card saying they were sorry it didn't work out, and handed it politely to Bongo upon his departure. 
       It would be a mistake not to explain on the surface, at least, some of Bongo's emotions at this point. He had been just as frustrated with his vocal constapation as the scientists had been, however, unlike his captors, Bongo had to live with ""Danny Boy"" streaming through his head non-stop for the rest of his life. He couldn't stuff it in a taxi cab and hope for its sake that it dies.  This had plunged Bongo into a deep, sulking depression. Every time he spoke, he drew stares from passerbys who, counter-intuitively, were not impressed with the talking orangutan, but hotly bothered by the constant alliteration. The constant ridicule and internal strife put Bongo on the edge of suicide. 
       Ten minutes after the taxi fare ran out and Bongo was abandoned on the median of the New Jersey turnpike southbound from Bayonne, Bongo made a rich discovery and a fast friend. After three months of listening to old C.C Rider's albums on the homeless man's tape deck, Bongo felt somewhat released from the prison of ""Danny Boy."" The song still cursed through his head, and Bongo could still only speak in lyrical fragments, but he had developed a funky-fusion swagger from the rhythmic pulses of the homeless man's only record. The homeless man was known to Bongo as ""Danny"" of course, although the homeless man preferred to be called, ""The Homeless Man.""
       Danny and Bongo, both derelicts of scientific experimentation (Bongo's humanization and The Homeless Man's government aid package), were perfect companions. The two partners yo-yoed around Bayonne, stopping at every Arby's they could find to sing a duet of Danny Boy into the drive-through microphone. The Homeless Man often would go flat and change keys on the higher notes, but Bongo's voice resonated in perfect pitch into the drive-through attendant's headset. Usually the two were able to make some kind of daring escape before the police showed up. 
        Pretty soon every Arby's in Bayonne was allocated a unit of armed New Jersy State Police officers to protect the audio rights of Arby's employees. A manhunt drained local law enforcement, but Bongo and The Homeless Man evaded arrest continually. Every day another Arby's would be hit, sending some unfortunate drive-through attendant to the nearest free clinic for shock treatment. News stations broadcast warnings, and Arby's had a difficult time hiring teenagers to fill their take-out windows. 
        By this time, Bongo had been living with The Homeless Man for about a year.  They had grown accustomed to calling their caroling outings ""jobs"" or ""hits"" or even, at The Homeless Man's suggestion, ""spankings."" The duo made several ""spankings"" in a week, despite National Guard occupation of every Arby's in the Mid-Atlantic. The swaggering ape's silohouette had become street legend, partially for its boasting, yet gentle glide, but mostly for the juxtaposition of hearing ""Danny Boy"" expelled from the vocal chords of such a funkarific orangutan. Later, on his interviews with The Biography Channel, The Homeless Man would comment of his swagger innapropriately that ""Larry King would be proud."" 
        Bongo's life had turned itself around - just in time to end, violently. The Homeless Man and Bongo blew a spanking that would become infamously known by the National Guard and the Media as ""The time that orangutan was killed by a rocket."" 
Despite several harpoon wounds, The Homeless Man survived the carnage. 
       Go to New Jersy. You will feel Bongo's funky presence. You will go to Arby's, and you will hear Danny Boy echoing in the restrooms.  You will hear the screams of former employees, and see the police tape and the armed personnel carriers. And if you listen closely enough, you will hear the regret of a team of scientists who didn't mean to let Bongo live. Mash another piece of gum onto the loudspeaker at Arby's, and be proud to pay homage to the only primate to change New Jersey forever."

"event","Wolfgang had always been a studious individual, with little distraction to cause him to be otherwise.  Even-tempered and a sponge of morality, he had little trouble refusing the villianous temptations of his peers - namely their hard-core drug usage.  However, the pressure of acceptance weighed heavily on his shoulders, like the book-laden backpack he dropped on the floor next to his locker..
...Biology, Calculus, History, he marked each book off on the checklist in his mind as he packed them into his locker. The book he needed, his English Advanced Grammar, was right where he left it, second from the bottom on his handy locker bookshelf.  Everytime he saw the shelf he smiled in self-satisfaction; surely none of his peers had been so foresighted to install such an ingenious miracle of student-grade shelving. 
   He had just finished, about to close the locker door, when in the far reaches of his peripheral vision, he saw him. Moe was the infamous drug addicted, tattooed, knife weilding school rebel visionary - an opiad toting sadist violator of even the most liberal of scholastic dress codes.  In every way, Moe was the Wolfgang's complete anthesis.  
   But today, Moe had a surplus he was desperate to unload, and Wolfgang was an appealing potential customer. 
   ""Yo yo sup fo'shizzle rizzle, biatch.""
   ""Hi Moe, what's it hanging like?""
   ""Fizzuck Yo'homes self bro.""
   Despite Wolfgang's grand display of street cool, he had amazing difficulty interperating and speaking the words Moe understood. The language barrier was inweildy and created an awkward tension..
   ""Bitch fool, I's gots somes of theses narco-totics you'is been bustin' yo-damn self fo' homes.""
    Wolfgang realized it was time to put up the imaginary drug sheild the school counselor had told him about. He felt a certain pride in the refusal he was about to give Moe.
   ""This is be da besterest white meat yo' does and score on da striz-eet, bitch.""
   ""No, Moe, I-""
   ""Don't be no hat-a bitch, I's offerin yo' izzle da bomdadest sheeizzle""
   Moe opened his jacket conspicously, frightening Wolfgang, who shot quick glances down both ends of the hall. Little baggies lined the shredded lining of Moe's jacket. Wolfgang, from some remote outpost of his brain, felt somewhat priviledged to be a witness to such a display. 
   Moe pulled one of the baggies from his jacket.  Waving it suggestfully in Wolfgang's face, Moe grinned a wide, sinister smile, pleased to once again be playing the tempter. 
   But Wolfgang wasn't tempted.  The romantisicm of the fleeting innocence of Moe's jacket was gone, and replaced with a sense of strange confusion.
   ""But, Moe..what is that?""
   ""Dis bes da mostest exquisite French Milk Camembert you's be eva puttin in yo shizzumpback.""
   French Camembert? Wolfgang was wildly disillusioned. He looked from the concealed handgun's buldge in Moe's pocket to his tattooed arms to his fierce piercings, and then to the fine cheese in the plastic baggie Moe still held in front of him. 
   The moral combustion engine in Wolfgang's head broke down. The juxtaposition was too much. Everything Wolfgang had ever known to be true had just shit its pants. 
   As Wolfgang's world collapsed inward, Moe replaced the baggie in his jacket and quietly excused himself.  He had scarred Wolfgang irrevocably, and the profit of a sale wasn't worth hanging around any longer. 
    Wolfgang remained at his locker, a shivering pile of human confusion. He aged rapidly by the sudden shock to his inflexible psyche. Right before his head exploded, Wolfgang reached behind him and tore down his miracle of student-grade shelving."

  What an inconvienience! I wish I was still at home, in bed.  Damn it. What if they lost it, will I never see it again? Do they have any sort of liability, will I be compensated?
      Bunch of crap, thats what it is. I had everything in there! My toothbrush, passport, oh fuck, all of my clothes! Great, now what am I going to wear? Oh damn my cell phone was in there too...and the package, oh shit, the package..
      How could I have been so stupid to leave my package in there? If someone finds it, heaven knows what will happen. I mean, if that were to fall into the wrong hands, oh god, it would be chaos! I know I should have kept the key to human perpetuation in my carry-on. 
      Damn, this is serious. Oh man, stop fidgeting..shit, your'e sweating. Someone's going to see. Okay, relax..luggage doesn't just vaporize into nothingness, they'll have it at the service desk..i hope.
      Oh god, I knew I shouldn't have tried to handle this on my own; I'm too irresponsible for this kind of pressure...now the world is going to end and it'll be all my damn fault. In my suitcase? What could I have possibly been thinking? The key to human survival on the planet Earth is in my suitcase, and I am one of those losers who loses his luggage on a trans-Atlantic flight...sonofabitch.

      Okay, here it comes again; my suitcase has to be on it this time.  Maybe if it's not here I'll go to the service desk..oh! Is that it? Oh, jesus, thats it..there it is! 
      Oh phew..that is such a relief, if mankind only knew how close it just was to being exterminated, well, it'd be pretty pissed at me. I feel a hundred pounds lighter..hmm, maybe I should check, make sure the package is still there before I continue to rejoice..
...ah yes, yes, there it is. Right where I left it; good ol' Ben and Jerry's New York Super Chunk Fudge recipe."

"event","Walton stood and stared.  The white gates, their luminent, pearly finish, sat planted in the ground before him. He swallowed; a rubbery nervous tic he had been trying to break himself of. 
    ""We've got plastic bags if you'd prefer""

    "" No no, I'll carry them..that's very considerate of you..""

     She looked at him quizically, somewhat surprised, even indignant at his refusal to accept her plasticized convinience. And he wasn't moving..just staring at the damn gate.

     ""Well, it's my job...you're all set to go when you are ready""

      It would have been too difficult to look at her and respond, too laborious to tear his eyes from the undullable potential of the gate.

      ""uh, yep.""

      What's going to happen if I go through them? Certainly they are too beautiful to be truely benevolent... 

       Walton's face cringed.  She could tell he was paralyzed with thought.  What rhetoric streamed through his mind she couldn't tell, and would not have cared if he had been making some sort of progress toward the exit. 

     ""May I help you with something else..or..what..?""

     ""No need, thanks.""

       She began to hypothesize the possible mind altering substances he looked like he would be the type to take.  He's not the drunk kind...and he's too neat to be any sort of mind-expanding hippie.  Maybe crack. Yes, crack. He's the business type - he doesn't fool around.  He can certainly afford it with those shoes. She began to entertain a notion to phone the police.

      Walton didn't budge. He stood and considered the radioactive tendencies of the white gate, and when he would eventually get cancer if he were to walk through it. It would be an expense he would have to pay for, and it would devastate his wife and children. Another reason..but it is soo wonderfully white and gate-ish...

     ""Sir, do you understand where the exits are?""

     ""Oh, yes, yes..I can see it thank you.""

     This was going too far..she fingered the telephone reciever, and rehearsed in her head what she would tell the operator with Walton still within earshot. There had to be some way to alert the police of the disturbance this man was stirring up without alarming him.  She pondered the paradox in her head...If I want him to go away, why would I secretly make a phone call so he stays right where he is? 

     ""Excuse me sir, but you need to leave now. I need you to go""

      Wow, she thought. That sounded incredibly passive and needy. And whiny. I told mom yesterday that I do stick up for myself and take control of things, lies, lies..I'm going to tell this guy off.. that'll show her. 

      ""Is there something wrong with you?"" she demanded. 

      Walton's thoughts were pierced every time she spoke to him. He didn't need any more damn help from some cashier. He didn't answer, preferring to ponder which rented video to hold over his crotch as he exited...the longer one would have more tape in it, maybe it would block out more radioactivity...

      This was too out of the ordinary.  Too much time has gone by. No one ever does this! Why doesn't he just leave? Fuck. 

      Walton, secure in his plan, held the sacrificial tape over his manhood, and trudged through the white gate. The shrill alarm cut through the stale video store atmosphere. 

      She was losing her patience with Walton. 

      ""Sir, how many times are you going to do that?  You can't go through the gate holding the video! I told you, the alarm will always go off! Jesus Christ!

      Walton turned around bashfully, and squeezed between the gate and the wall back to the line, of which he had been the front of for an innapropriate length of time. 

      Walton stood and stared.  The white gates, their luminent, pearly finish, sat planted in the ground before him. He swallowed; a rubbery nervous tic he had been trying to break himself of."

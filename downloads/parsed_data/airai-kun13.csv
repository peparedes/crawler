"event","I<font color=""#3366ff""> really forgot to post this on my journal! <br /><br />2 weeks ago, we've just come back from <font color=""#00ccff"">Kuala Lumpur</font>! It's nice seeing my Nii-san take us to a trip during my school holidays just after we've come back from home. He take me to many places including <font color=""#800080"">KLCC</font>! I really enjoy the time we spent at <font color=""#cc99ff"">Kinokuniya Bookstore</font> (although some people stared at us as if we were a <font color=""#ff0000"">couple</font>)<br /><br />We bought a lot of book and (of course) Rai-niisan's favorite philosopher books!<br /><br />I really loves my holidays with Nii-san! :)</font>"

"event","<font color=""#3366ff"">Today's a very boring day (in my Nii-san opinion...I know he's cranky because he have to go to my awards ceremony at school) it's hard for him to get away from the staring of his 'few' (more like&nbsp; 50 of them) <font color=""#ff0000"">fangirls</font>. I was happy that he was present with me at that time since both of my parents will not make due to their business trip.<br /><br />I did make it out with <font color=""#993366"">my oh-so-friend</font> Niea...we've been fighting for like a month and I ignore her apologies. Nii-san said:<br /><br />&nbsp;""it's wise to let her know her own fault before laying it on others""<br /><br />Rai-niisan is a philosopher.<br /><br />And he's a wise person too although he's acting so cold towards everyone except to those who important to him.<br /><br />That's all for today!</font><br /><br /><img width=""130"" height=""97"" alt="""" src=""http://i164.photobucket.com/albums/u34/AiRai_sifu-13/4263068013l.jpg"" /><br /><font color=""#3366ff"">Hmm...I hope Yuuri won't get mad at me because I forgot to online on the time she'd ask me to..</font>"

"event","I just submit my first deviantART. It's only sketches though...<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/54460383/""><img alt="""" src=""http://tn1-3.deviantart.com/fs16/150/f/2007/122/b/0/Muu_chan_by_Ai_chan13.jpg"" /><br />Muu-chan</a> by ~<a href=""http://Ai-chan13.deviantart.com/"">Ai-chan13</a> on <a href=""http://www.deviantart.com/"">deviant</a><a href=""http://www.deviantart.com/"">ART</a><br /><br />This is my first Tactics character that I had ever draw. Well...technically it's Muu-chan (how I imagined her looks in her human form)<br />It took me around 43 minutes and 37 seconds to complete this drawing (my Nii-san count the time). Hmm...what do you think?"

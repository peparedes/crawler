"event","i've changed. i'm different. i'm not the man i used to be. is it so surprising? that over time, as experience after experience fills my burgeoning teenage brain with new ideas and concepts that i might, in the end, or at least in the process, become a different person? hadn't i been changing all along? wasn't i growing and pruning the entire time? what makes it so surprising then? to look on things created in the past and mentally go back to where you were when you made those things and realize that you don't think that way anymore is scary. what if you liked thinking that way? could you get back there? would you, could you, with a fox? i can't even type that quickly anymore. my pride is deflated once again. well it has to be supported by something, doesn't it? so many questions. 

here's a statement for you: i liked me back then, i want to go back there. i want to be able to write like i did back then, i want to have the naive butterflies at the mere touch of a favored female. gone are the butterflies, replaced by dead, unaffected moths which bump into the innerwalls of my abdomen and threaten heartburn in a few decades. no more daydreaming, no more crackpot businesses and schemes, no more inventions, no more personal naratives, no more mystery and in leiu of mystery no more wonder. pragmatic. economical. both goals and totems of an unflinching urge to both escape responsibility and embrace it all at once. i curse at my father now. isn't that nice. there was a time when i wouldn't say the word shit infront of my father and would even go so far as blush when the thought and very beginning of the word came out. 

thoughts of my mother ring in and out of a chasm right behind my optical nerve that grow bigger with each passing moment. each season reminds me of a season that saw me see her. i began righting a memoir, the plan of which was to list my romantic endevours and failures and then link them back to my mother. very freudian. like everything else i got eight pages in and haven't touched it since. there's nothing like the feeling of a job, well, unfinished. ah, another change, i have a computer chair now, real nice and pleathery. you could fuck my mother on it and even she'd say it was real nice and comfy. relationships involve communication. without communication infact, there is no relationship. just like without sensation there is no reality, just thought. and that's all that's left when a relationship loses it's communication, thought. thought that can make you cry tears that only fall on the inside. dry eyed, college ready, under-funded, and well-fed i have a mother whose knowledge of me and mine stops at the summer of eighth grade. go over, ask her some questions, how did your son do in high school? what kind of classes did he take? where did he decide to go to college? what does he plan to take? is he living there? how <i>do</i> you pay for all that? i read newsweek today and there was an advertisement about bipolar disorder. this brought to mind my mother. my mother who <i>doesn't</i> have bipolar disorder. in the ad it raised several questions: ""Flying off the handle?,"" ""Racing thoughts?,"" ""Irritable?,"" ""Spending out of control?,"" ""Buying things you don't need?"" nope, not my mom. 

last time i saw her she was bigger then i remembered. this woman hasn't changed in appearance since she was 18, in however many years and decades she grabbed a couple wrinkles and several different shades of brown, the most worrysome shade for her being grey, the funniest of which for me was pink. i came over to visit with a good friend of mine and she looked very different. the change sat sad and deep in me. she had always been and would always be mom, painting, thriftstoring, sewing, couponclipping, redecorating, shoppingspree, uphostering, crazy, mad, funny, sad, comforting mom. who was this infront of me then? this was not my unchanging image. my fears were abated when i found out there was a new medication that she was on that had forced her weight into odd directions. everything was ok, even if her moods and inclinations couldn't stay still long enough for a fly to land on, at least mom could still look like mom.

i <i>have</i> changed, it's sad but true. i <i>am</i> less outgoing. not a whole lot less, but a noticeable amount. i create less. a lot less. i write less, i draw less, i computer less, i do less. i less. i read more, a whole lot more. i read a dozen books at a time. each book finished is replaced with two brand spankingly new, larger tombs of even more a intriguing and intellectually gratifying nature. fiction and nonfiction. everything from lolita to quantum physics. i started a travel encyclopedia, but decided to take it slow after doing the math on 1400 pages and size 7 print. i finished a few on meditation. got through one and a half on quantum physics. grabbed the entire history of art in a twelve dollar, yellow bound, hard back. i seem to have more acne. i think. i use more treatment so i don't think the <i>net</i> acne is up. but suffice it to say that i have more <i>persistent</i> acne. i play instruments. i enjoy them too. i travel. i laugh, but i don't laugh as much. 

i just now realized that. even as i typed the words. i just don't seem to laugh as much. i don't laugh as much with my father and i don't laugh as much with my friends. i don't laugh as much with my family and not enough with strangers. i laugh and i think. i laugh and i worry. i laugh and i space out. but i don't laugh and laugh anymore. there was a period in my life where i could laugh for damn near a half an hour without stopping. it go so that several times i thought that i was going to die, right then and there. i couldn't even think it was so funny, whatever it was. afterward i would reflect on how, if i had found myself just a little bit more amused i could've found myself without any air left to laugh with. i guess i would've just passed out, but i had gotten over my fear of death by then anyway. why don't i laugh as much? what went wrong? what change made the world less funny? i cry the same amount as i used to, that being none unless confronting a parent about living arrangements. something about shelter, or the debate overwhich, brings tears to my eyes. i guess i only had one of three choices, either laugh more, the same, or less. i've been almost brought to tears several times. i can't do it though. i've almost puked several times as well. as far as the puking i promised myself at the age of twelve to stop. so far so good. i try to make friends laugh and they look off awkwardly and titter. i have no one to amuse anymore and no one to really be amused by. desensitization is reaching it peak. blood, guts, two lesbians having sex and a large, well combed, groucho-marx mustache could fall in my lap and on any given day i'd probably be largely unaffected.

i have friends. i had friends before, but i have friends now. for the most part they're the same friends too. some really old ones are trying to make a come back, and some new ones seem to be a given with a move to college. but the ones i'd had i pretty much still have. i think. i think they're disaffected too. well, lets be more specific, i think the ones i spend the most time with are disaffected. there's a reveen in the expanse between us. a rages between us and rain falls ontop of us. we wave from out islands of mud to one another and quip about the weather, but never seem to make it over to each other, at least not for very long. the longer i stand on that island the more the ground beneath me begins to buckle. as dirt turns to mud, and mud turns to water, there's really not much left to stand on. people ask you, if you had to go to a desert island, who would you bring? well, if you had to wade in the middle of the ocean, who would you do it with? if you could find an island with different people would you swim over to it, even if it meant leaving your forlorned swimmer acquaintences behind. what if a desert island is better off enjoyed alone?

what ever happened to knowing where you stood with people? talking to people, finding out where they stand, telling them where you stand and being happy in your standings. encouraging, emasculating, and having some fun. inside jokes and simple minded fun. forgiveness and understanding. forgetting and not giving up. leaving the past behind and moving on up. i used to know people, we could jump on the good ship and do the bad thing. not a care in the world, we could lay in fields of grass and wile the days away. when did the sky come down so low and heavy? where did these clouds of grey and moods of blue erupt from? when did the rain clouds get so large that they stopped showing blue skies every once and a while?

here's a good joke: how do you pay for college when you don't have enough money? by working at mc donalds instead! o ho ho, that's a knee slapper. finances have recently been abruptly and forceably placed into my lap. i wouldn't have minded it as much except for that i have no income, and having only been hired onto this position, head accountant for me, days ago i have absolutely no information on the subject. all i know is that there is a lot of money needed for college, and a lot of money that i don't have. should be fun. to make the next four, or maybe, just maybe five, years that much more fun and laid back i've opted for a double major, just because the fear and responsibility of merely <i>paying</i> for higher education was not enough for me. no sir, i had to double it up.

i also have fights with my father. lots of them. bushels and bushels of them. some of them necessary, some of them warrented, some of them have about as much to do with me as poker does with horseback riding. there was a certain turning point a few months back, the kind of turning point you can only see afterwards, where the amount of time spent arguing with my dad finally overcame the amount of time having fun, or even being civil. change piled ontop of more change like pancakes baked too dry to be good covered in syrup too sweet to be tasty. you know all those half hour laughing marathons i used to have? every single goddamn one of them was spurned from my dad. now it seems we can't have more then a five minute conversation without some stern talk of this or that overtaking any pleasant chit-chat that was about. he has himself a girl now. i was and am very glad that he does. he's rather a suave guy when he wants to be and was stuck for the longest time sitting at home twiddling his thumbs. now he's out and about going to restaurants and movies and the like. of course i've been doing this with friends for years, and now with him doing the same and him working six days of out seven almost every week of the year it's been more like angry roommates then father and son. after the move to college, however, all that will change. <i>then</i> it'll be more like estranged, hopefully proud, father and estranged, hopefully responsible, son. we visited new york this past week. just the two of us. it was really a lot of fun. we always have a good bit of fun wandering around manhattan. we laughed and laughed, not as much as before but more then the status quo. we had a genuinely good time and i can honestly say that for the entire day we, the both of us, enjoyed ourselves. free of worry and fear we trekked through new york like we meant it, and we did. i think it's one of the few and far between completely and unwaveringly happy times i've had in the past few months.

and do tell, you say, what of the women, you say. well...what of them? i've made my peace with my romance problems, yet it has done nothing to help them. things don't turn out any better. i go through the same motions. each time they get more and more mechanical. i read from the same script, and each time my acting gets less and less believeable. sometimes i even come back to the same women, and at those times the world goes plastic. and at some of those times love jumps through time and melts everything around me, and warms the inside machined parts that had long been unused, untouched, and unremembered. at those times i lement at my inability to reheat those long cold relationships and instead fold a little more of myself into myself. so what has happened recently? well i had my first asian. ching chong wing wong motherfucker. i did about par with that one. that was more then six months ago and lets see...erm...nope, nothing since. i'm done chasing. i'm. done. chasing. i still want, but i'm tired of tumbling foot over hand toward what can now safely be considered inevitable. well, thanks to my dad i know i'll be a good father, if i ever get there. is that any consolation? no.

ok, ok, ok, i get the message alarm clock. it's time to start the day."

"event","so, i've opened up my livejournal to the world. mistake? maybe. in either case, it's done, and it would take about fifteen more minutes of going through each entry to make them private again.

so, why have i opened them up? especially after not so much as visiting livejournal for twenty two weeks? truth be told i'm not sure. i guess i want there to be an end. i want to hit return on my keyboard and move on to the next paragraph. i've also copied one of the more amusing comments that i made while i was on livejournal.

i've found that things are continually changing, but things always stay the same. i am who i will be, and who i was. that hasn't changed in twenty two weeks, that hasn't changed in sixteen years. the only thing that has changed is that i'm not so afraid of people seeing my entries. originally the entries were open but i was anonymous, then the entries were anonymous and i wasn't. now nothing's anonymous. it's all there.

it needed closure. i've been done with it. it needed an ending. so here it is; i am and always will be me, i will fall in love with the wrong ones, say all the wrong things to the right one and the right thing to the wrong one, end up going out with the ones that won't care, apathy will wash over me and as clockwork as the sunrise i too will rise up from my own self loathing and reach again for the ideals that i've always reached for. then again there only ever was one. i have and am only able to follow one organ. i'll let you mull over which one you think i follow slavishly, but there are a select few who will read that and know immediately. to those of you who know, good for you, get your goddamn medal on your way out.<strike>i had lots of fun, with all of</strike> i had a ton of experiences the past few years. not all of them were good, not all of them were bad. in perspective it all ended up just being.

if you look closely at the words, the paragraphs can begin to look like bunnies too. except that last one, that one looks more like a squirrel.









yeah, i think this is done. to all those i left behind, to all those who left me behind, to all those who looked at the above and below paragraphs and just said, 'fuck it,' i hope you keep fond memories of me after all of the dust settles."

"event","he had carbon fiber feet and ball bearings for knees. he knew he could never fit in with the other boys, he knew he would be an outcast. even then he knew and right then and there, he decided to accept being on the fringes of society and go where ever life may take him. right then and there at the tender age of twelve he decided to become a drifter.

it is a terrible and odd thing what men can do to men, and even worse what boys can do to boys. children can be the most sinister messengers of our own inner doubts and miss comings. many men have been jaded and crushed by childhood tauntings, never to fully return to their well balanced beginnings. however, to some this undue pressure has a different affect entirely, it creates an emotional caluss that does not dissapate with time. instead it builds apon itself as the memories grate against the unconscious mind, ever knocking at the back of the head.

Sunday had no interest in playing with the other boys, or at least that was what he told himself. he could often be found busying himself with the air rifle he had gotten the previous christmas from his senile aunt. he would spend hour after hour setting up old soup cans in a row across a termite rotted tree which, under the weight of its own weakened sickness, toppled onto its side, where it lay to allow a range for which Sunday could practice. he would go every day after school, and spend much of the weekend out back, with his rifle and cans. as one could imagine he began to get quite good, remarkably good infact.

he loved shooting. it loved the smell of the fallen leaves and grass and dirt as he lined up his shot and effortlessly, but accurately, pierced the tin on both ends, right where he wanted to. well maybe a little to the left of where he wanted to. he would have to readjust the sight again. the humid, damp feeling in the air, mornings in the fall. the baking heat that would dry up every pore and make him bring several bottles of water out along with the boxes of ammo. even the stark whiteness of the world during cool winter afternoons sitting between the leaf striped, snow covered trees as shot after shot rang out through the air, and the cold tin layed in a row on the tree, lousy with termites, rendering them almost unrecognizeable. almost, the ridges that ran around each can would always remind you of those mornings when he would wake up sick and his mother would let him stay home from school. she would always heat up some tomato soup for him. after finishing the bowl she would always force him back to sleep, either with love or guilt, he had to make sure he <i>was</i> infact sick enough to have stayed afterschool, after all.

but there wasn't much to do out in rural maine unless you were partial to fishing. Sunday wasn't one for fishing. he had all the patience in the world, he just didn't like fish. he had tried fishing once, with his father, and was actually fairly skilled at it. he caught two and a half fish worth cooking. the half was a rather scrawny fish that his dad had kept even though it was below the legal length, just so that Sunday would feel more accomplished. And he did, somewhat, but the thing of it was that each time he felt that tug, after patiently waiting without more then breathing, he would reel and reel and reel only to find a bizarre monster on the other end, and became immediately regretful for having fished at all. to make matters worse the fish, with their bulging, ludicrous eyes, always seemed to be looking Sunday dead in the eyes. with that expression of nonchalant disappointment, the look his mother gave him when she caught him sneaking a cupcake before supper, even when he knew he wasn't supposed to. he felt as if the fish felt let down, as if they had some pact that Sunday had forgotten and then broken. he didn't like fish.

when he was thirteen he got his final pair of legs. the doctor said, the pair that would last him until death. since these were so terminal, his parents decided to go all out. it was water proof, powered by sunlight and movement, and probably heat or something, or was that nuclear power? he could never remember. he knew there were was some kind of fussion or fission involved. at any rate, it had a continually readjusting suspension and, a newly added feature on this model, <i>enhanced</i> muscles, which basically meant that he could jump a foot or so higher then he normally could, and run marginally faster, mostly a gimmick, his parents ate it up with a spoon. they even went so far as to say loosing his legs was a blessing. a blessing. as if god had came down with his impossibly enormous hands and snapped off Sunday's legs as an act of mercy. what a blessing. he was just happy his feet looked more like feet, and actually had much of the movement of a real foot. he could even move his toes, not seperately, but the big toe was seperated from the rest and they could move independently from the rest of the foot. it was also made of carbon fibre, there was that. but then, everything that wasn't made of titanium was made of carbon fiber. also the legs were a bit fatter then his previous pairs, he liked that too. it made them seem more like legs. and as icing on the cake he would never have to recharge them again. it was odd, at first, not having to stick a cord into his side every night before going to bed, but it was a good feeling, a feeling close to freedom. a feeling like he got when he hit a cambells can right in the middle, right where he wanted to. thank god for that fission heat sundial thing.

a few weeks after his birthday a family moved in next door. Sunday had noticed the moving trucks from his window as he was getting up for school. he hoped that someone his age was moving in. as much as he denied it, he still had a yearning for a friend, or at least someone that could be considered a peer, that he could talk to. all the other kids in his small town had already written him off as a freak, or in the least, to weird to talk to.

"event","i seem to have a crush. well it is a crush that i've had before, but it stayed dormant for a time, only to peek it's...beautiful, frustrating little head out from behind the tree next to the creek where all my dreams flow past me. in the grassy knoll of my own self loathing. self loathing is not accurate, i do not loath myself. i loath my actions, at times. i loath my situation, at times. 

let none who've known me say i have not lived, while i did live. it is said one is measured, not by the material he has hoarded in his lifetime, not by the amount of power he has amassed on his doorstep, but by the relationships he has formed during the span of his time. i have been very luck. i have formed many relationships which i will hold dear nigh until the day i am breathing goodbye to those who stay with me to hear the last word said. many of which i came across not long before last summer. i want them to know that someday i will forget them, but one that day i will not have the ability to recall my name.

i've thought about the next year and a half. i thought about how i'll be separated from possible the most wonderful amalgamation of people that i've come across in my short and fortunate life. i've never been good with keeping in touch. i've dropped friendships like a bag of spoiled potatoes, merely because they moved, or went to a different school. this is usually the result of a dispute my sentamental side versus my analytical side. practically, it is no longer practical to keep up the friendship. sentamentally, i'll end up moving on, but not forgetting. 

i've forgotten so much. i've. blanked. out. so. much. there are somethings, some people, some memories that i don't want to forget, i have left the things i needed to blank out, yet my memory is still very much instable. why is it, just because my mother slapped me across the face when i was six, and i saw the red outline of her hand on my face in the wall mirror of our little apartment, that it now seems like i can't remember the good along with the bad. 

i can barely remember the time that my family and i made that four foot hole in the sand while at the beach for two weeks. my cousin, who i havn't seen in since he was younger then me, was there for that trip, i can't recall his face, neither from then or from the last time i saw him. i vaguely remember the chain of events that brought him into my mother's house, and my room the year before i left. 

they met in the supermarket, after years of not making contact, they saw each other in acme. approximately a week later he got kicked out of his mother's house and, to my indifference, my mother, having not seen this man who was her little nefew for so many years that it seemed almost ludicrous to do so, invited him into our house. further more she invited him into my room, without consulting me beforehand, of course.

there are a sparse few memories that i have of him from his brief stay. i remember playing gamecube with him for several hours. i remember remembering my cousin for the first time in a long time, remembering how he was. other then that it was mostly dealing with yet another problem that presented itself in the months proceeding my leave from the house of my mother. i remember listening to him lay on the bed that was brought into my already cramped room, talk endlessly to all hours of the night to a number of nameless women, cooing into their ears from afar, talking just to talk. i remember him forcing me, by pain of not being let to go to bed, to do diamond push ups. do at least one. come on, do at least one. from what i remember i went to bed at four that night, an unprecedented bedtime for a school night.

then he tried to teach me how to fight. this man who must've beaten up on the boy-cousin i knew as a child, was a baggy pants, swearing shadow of my memories. their relation seemed to end at his big eyes and olive skin. my mother got it into her head that i needed to know how to fend off bullies. she felt that i was too sheltered. for the life of me i cannot see why she would even think that i would come to a group of bullies and not run. however, this idea went down the grapevine, eventually reaching the ear of my cousin. one night, always later then i would've liked, he decided to teach me how to fight. he showed me the stance and had me make a fist. however the impromptu lesson ended quickly after he accidentally jabbed me in the teeth. the most powerful part of this memory are the feeling of four top teeth moving towards my gums, and the taste of blood as i feel into unconsciousness in my bed.

another incident that stands out in my mind is when my mother order chicken wings. at the time i was a bit persnickity with my chicken wings and left a good amount of the meat on the bones. for some odd reason he felt the need to ridicule me for this, unheedingly digging into me. the thing that makes this moment in time strike out at me during odd hours of the night is that with this ridicule my mother responded by, not repramanding him, but instead joining in on the proding. i knew then, and i had known infact for sometime, something had to give.

my mental state has been stable, but at the same time, stressed in a fluctuation responsive to the ups and downs of my stop and go life. i think this stress is manifesting it self in through physical means. last week i was having trouble to breath for a half hour. everything else was completely normal i just was unable to get enough air into my lungs for a certain period of time. i'm usually not very easily perturbed so i didn't mind it. it happened again the same week and i still was not distressed. however, it seems that my physical state has been in a continual downward spiral, baring the occational plateau, parallel to the mental side of things.

i've been having issues with sleep. i love sleep but it doesn't seem to love me back all that much as of late. last night i got a total of ten hours of sleep and i was still lathargic as i floated on fatigue from class to class to class. i've been getting accute pain in my stomach in the morning for the past two days. i've also been partial to becoming dizzy without warning. it would be interesting if this was a sign of the end. a bit morbid, yes, but what is life if not a long, gilded road to death? besides it would be interesting only in that it would result in a complete change in my goals, priorties, and even day to day activities. i have always been quite biased toward change. morbidly so."

"event","i am an odd mix of my parents. i wouldn't say that it is fifty-fifty exactly, but close. this is often a good thing. this is often a bad thing.

my mother, a subject of much inner contention. there is a duplicity about her that keeps her unique. she is the artist in me. she is walking around our second story duplex, listening to beatles on our cheap little stereo, painting the walls white. she is like no one else i've ever met. she has my eyes. she has my hair. she came from argentina, became a professional translator, and taught me no more than a word of spanish, la lengua. she said my father was a bad man. she is my mother, no one else can say that, no one but her. she taught me how to hold a fork and knife, the <i>right</i> way. she taught me to hold the door, take the bag of, and greet with a pleasant hello, every woman in the world who happens upon me. she taught respect but gave me none. she said she loved me, she said to get out of her house, the house that she had purchased so that i could inherit something from her, the house that she is still paying off. she is dying, just a little quicker then the rest of us. she is too weak to work, she is strong enough to attack me with her purse, me and her boyfriend. she is one phone call away from seeing me every other weekend. i have learned not to wait for it. i love her still. she.

my father, an ever present pillar in my life. a lighthouse to my ship, he is the reason why i am anywhere close to well balanced. he made me independant, built me up and sent me off. he fought for me four eight years of his life, eight years he consoled me, who consoled him? in that tender time of my life, when i was most vulnerable emotionally, he helped me get through the proverbial storm. the ironic consequence of this emotional stability and this independence he has supported and instilled in me is that it now often finds me away from him, out and about, so to speak. my father is where i got my moral base. he has heavily influenced my taste in music, and movies, though my affinity for prince does not near his. 

i have tried to glean from them only the good parts, but what i actually got was somewhere in the middle. my father's philosophy, somewhat inspired by the buddists, has helped. so has my mother's flare for creativity. my mother's affinity for school, my father's emphasis on education. they both have their bad sides, but time only remembers the happy days."

i seem to have a reoccuring, passionate need to escape. not life, it'll always be there, if i ever dreamt about taking it away, i better wake up and appologize. this situation, this over and over again, every weekend, every weekday. i don't have these thoughts when i'm with friends. they help me forget, forget my want to be away from them. to be away from everyone i now know. to leave unexpectedly, with the clothes i can fit in my bag, and the meager amount of money i've managed to scratch together. leave this town. go somewhere, somewhere different, somewhere with a beach, or maybe snow, somewhere where its always warm, or always cold. 

the problem seems to be surviving in the middle ground, the midpoint between hot and cold. i live lukewarm. i never really get all that upset. i get a fair share of happyness. the two are neatly intertwined day in, day out, hour after hour, second after second, dripping out of me. but they've intermingled too much...red and orange and blue have all mixed together and i'm left with brown. a slightly orange brown, but brown none the less. i want change. i want bad, i want good. i want something. i want passion. i've lost the passion in living. maybe its just this room, this room closing in on me. this room is my life, i love everything in it, but there is something missing. 

five years, we've got five years, that's all we've got. imagine that. what if you had five years to live? would you be going to school <i>then</i>? would you riot in the street, become part of the mob, unable to comprehend not existing, afraid of what they don't understand, angry at being fearful, unsure of what to do, who to turn to, they make attempts at immediate satisfaction by getting material goods from through store windows. 

the truth of it is we will all die eventually, its just not as evident, it doesn't come up in day to day life, and that's where we live, in the day to day. i would continue school if all we had to live was five years, even though it would no longer be in session, i would at least continue to further my knowledge. many people might see this as foolish, with only five years left, what use would learning be? most people would probably go through a whirlwind of histeria, followed by either a religious or an extreme response. people would be praying in the streets for days, people would be laying in the streets for days, people would be laying people for days, for possibly months this would continue, but can one survive on naught but this for five years. 

the real question then becomes: if you would react this way, why not react the same way now? you're going to die, there's a good chance it might just be in the next five years. drank too much beer at a party, died of alcohol poisoning; tripped and fell on his head, died of head trama. why not spend today as if it was your last? i don't mean that you should jump out a plane, conversely i mean that you should take pleasure in the little things in life. you can't spend you're entire life chasing the highs, learn to accept the lows as part of life along with the highs. 

its all life and you're living it, right now, not after i'm done my homework, not after school, but all the time. you're going to be sad, really, can't get out of bed sad, but you're also going to be happy, a happyness that can not be put into words, a happyness that'll make you seem as if floating as you walk. the important thing about life is to understand that things will happen, and that unless it physically harms you its not going to be the end of your world. you have to learn to seperate yourself from your emotions, as hard as it may sound, because they only exist in your mind, they can only effect you if you let them, you give them life and you can keep them in check.

"event","pool is amazing. i love playing pool. i'm also fairly good at it, so that helps slightly in my enjoyment, but i enjoy the game whether i'm winning or losing. as a pre-adolescent it taught me to seperate myself from my emotions, to not have my feelings influence what i'm doing. it's also a thinking man's game, angles and banks, and combinations, and safeties, and pushes, and scratches, everything is strategy, everything is skill.

i feel like shit. well, wait, i've been trying to make use of metaphorical language in this, maybe help my writing a little bit. so, i feel as if someone has taken a needle and stuck it into my left temple, shoved it until it came out of my right temple, opened my mouth, filled it with bees, and then...shit on my face. not very eloquent, but i'm not exactly in an eloquent mood.

always a friend, never a boyfriend. well, i'm being a bit overly dramatic here. i have had girlfriends, i know people who havn't, i have no right to feel like shit, they do. and yet i still feel like shit. it simply goes to show that how you feel has no correlation to what's going on, or whether what you're feeling is warranted.

i feel as if floating off my chair, i feel weightless. i've been sitting in this position for too long. i have only moved my hands to type. often when i sit like this i begin to tingle all over, and feel as if without substance, this is one of those times. my head seems to throb, but a gentle throbing, like a mother rocking her baby to sleep. the rest of my body seems to disappear, though if i were to look down it's still there, odd. my vision has begun to blur, i should focus. i should focus on life as well. its passing me by. second by second. i sit hear without substance, with nothing to offer, and life keeps on going past, i don't even turn to watch it go. it's gone.

i have no original thoughts. they are only thoughts that other people have had, that i now have because of the books that they have written that i have read. even if i hadn't read their books i would still have their thoughts. i have not be presented with anything wholly unique, nor anything abnormal to process it with. therefore, i have no original thoughts, if i create something new it is only because my situation warrants it, or the original version has been forgotten. like when the romans made concrete.

i don't think i'll ever be satisfied. ever. this is because of the nature of satisfaction. it is inately temporary. you eat a sandwich, you are no longer, hungry, soon another need or want arrises and your satiated hunger is not enough. now you want some rest. you take a nap. you wake up, now you're hungry again. its a cycle, and a cycle that keeps us alive. if we were to be satisfied forever, we would die, not wanting to eat or sleep. being inteligent life forms this concept now applies to other things. i have a new job, but now i want more pay. i can play rollerskate, but now i want to play piano. this sense of dissatisfaction now not only keeps us alive, but pushes us to better ourselves. this dissatisfaction can also disapoint us when we are unable to satiate our relative hungers. i have great friends. twelve of them. and yet i don't have a girlfriend, it is not enough. nothing is ever enough, and in the search for wholeness in our lives we let life pass us, we must learn to be contented with what we have, consoled by tomorrow's promise of more; more food, more sleep, more love."

"event","i am rested. its a wonderful feeling. i havn't felt this way in some...five days. i'm going to continue this feeling by going to be now and waking up at eleven. it'll be nice. 

at first when i looked back on this week, i felt as if i had done it all wrong. i had made the wrong choices, taken the wrong path, penciled in the wrong bubble, gone for the mystery box instead of the new boat, and just all around messed up. however, mulling over it now, i see that i made my mistakes, but no more than usual. it was more of an emphasis on every bad decision because of my sleep deprived state. i was so dead-set, i was so sure that to hear something to the contrary, to read something to the contrary, it was like losing love all over again. i needed steady ground, i needed another one. now, my response to this was increased, or at least more drastic than it would've/should've been, because of my befuddled state. the issue of my sleepless nights affecting my semi-conscious days worried me, but being semi-conscious, the day was gone before i had finished thinking about it. all in all, my heart was in the right place, i just needed to hold a little more steadfast to which direction it alluding to. as a ship through fog is lead by a lighthouse beam, so am i lead by my own beacon. whether it leads me to friendly beaches or rocky shores i will head its call, and go where it might send me.

i've decided to keep the number of people aware of my current affection to a small number. this is because of my recent misguided episode where i confided in many people only to find my affection wasn't able to return the sentiment, or rather things seemed to depict her as such. this put me in somewhat of an awkward situation. i had told somewhere near a half dozen people that i would be asking her out, now i had lost my footing. i had nothing to stand on and no supports to keep the roof from falling ontop of me. to make things relatively worse, i had a crowd whom i had assembled present to watch.

my eyes are dry, i shouldn't have left my contacts in for the past three weeks. i'm going to get cataracs. i don't know how to spell cataracs, i probably never will. it just doesn't come up all that often. i've never actually had to spell it. its an awkward word anyway. i've come to terms with my future ailment. i justify thusly, it's more convenient presently, to hell with later. or more accurately, out of sight out of mind, and one cannot <i>see</i> something one looks <i>through</i>.

my hair's too long. not all of it, just a small section. my sideburns. i'm starting to look like a heretic jew, or whatever they're called. i couldn't imagine my with long curly sideburns down to my chin, so they must be trimmed.

i was talking to one whom my affection recently lies with about how i came to be in the group of friends that i recently reside in. it seems, to no small degree mind you, that i owe it all too a certain caring little woman. during sophmore year i had a class with her, my only regular class of the year, and at first she delt with my curtly. this was not because she had known me previously, but from some false, and rather negative, rumors spread by a mutual acquaintence. 

we began talking during class, the teacher's only claim to her title was standing in front of a blackboard and we had a mutual friend who sat adjacent to us both. these two factors, taken together, resulted in us getting into conversations frequently. she began to realise i wasn't the horrible person who had been described to her. that i was giving her answers for all of our exams couldn't of hurt either. 

now why, you might ask, was i giving her, this completely random nice person, answers during our tests? having a teacher as we had, one is not motivated to study for her tests after a small number of them. i however, motivation coursing through my veins, was completely at peace with studying to ensure my grade. i had no qualms with sharing my aquired knowledge with my surrounding peers.

i think this acquaintance transformed into a true friendship in one pivital event. i was tired from having stayed up too late the night previous, and i informed her of this. she immediately told me to sleep, offering her hoodie to sleep on. she all but forced me into unconscious, which is extremely and utterly her, ever caring and nurturing. 

the rest, as they say, is history."

"event","to have loved and lost is not better than to have never loved before. i'd rather be ignorant of what it is to love then be taunted by my current lack of love. it was great at the time, doesn't help me now. although it was love, it took me a while to recognise it. its gone now, and so is she.

i shouldn't tell people who i'm interested in. i always end up looking like an ass. i guess i'll tell jonny, but he knows i'm an ass, so he should be fine with it. otherwise, it ends up biting me in the ass. there's someone else, he doesn't live near her, hasn't seen her in a couple months, but that's ok, he'll still manage to completely fuck up any chances i ever had. its ok. i've come to term with rejection, being dejected, and injection, the latter having to do with my recent addiction to heroin, i digress. the problem now is the utter lack of hope, there. are. no. prospects. none. well, at the very least no realistic prospects, there was one but apparently she might take a proposition as 'too random,' i should, 'arrange a meeting outside of school first.' still a proposition just dressed in sheep's clothing. maybe i'll tell roxanne too...then again, maybe not, she has less knowledge of my being an ass and it should stay that way.

looking back on the week, i've noticed that my lack of sleep has had a detrimental effect on my thought processes. a very detrimental effect. not so much in school, though its been harder to focus, but in, you guessed, romance. hath there no sword like affection, grab the wrong end and you're fucked. i groped in the dark and i felt steel. i jumped from one to the other, surprised that the action which i was so set on completing could be foiled by one i havn't said more than three words to. the other gives me looks. however, i don't know what those looks allude to, i need a translator, one of those pocket dictionaries that go from language to language...::body language to english::. wouldn't that be nice, exactly why it doesn't exist, too nice, too easy, we were meant to fumble in the dark for the ever allusive nimble heart that we all desire.

"event","...how many entries in how many hours?

i want to learn the piano. its funny because i've owned three instruments and i have no knowledge of how to use any of them. two guitars and a keyboard i got when i was ten. i was never offered lessons, just instruments. 'here, go pull a jimi hendrix, teach yourself and be amazing.' other than the fact that it'll be cool and insanely interesting to be able to entertain myself in a completely new and amazing way, i need something to do that isn't school and isn't 'play' something inbetween, learningplay...playlearning, plearning. 

friends are great. they're comforting and interesting and funny. they can be bitchy, boring, and sad...but so can all people, yes including me, though I hide it...and for the most part pretty well, but what kind of friend would i be if i was not to be there to comfort them, help them deal with their problems, joke with them, make them feel better.

school friends...friend friends, where do we draw the line? why must a line be drawn? i used to have all school friends, i had a good amount of them, but they were only <i>school</i> friends. somehow that made them less good, less satisfying. its odd. but i suppose the boundary makes sense. made to make us feel better about our non-school friends, we can make friends that can stand us <i>outside</i> of school, look at us. do you feel closer to a person when you call them an outside of school friend? why can't they just be a good friend? is there such a thing as a good school friend...or a good friend that you only see in school?

"event","well...less tired now, which is odd cause i havn't slept yet. i havn't done any work either. i've just been sitting here. i made my picture. i get into things like that. i'll join some random online society and then make an appropriate avatar. its fun. usually they outlast my interest in the community. i have pimples...yet my avatar suspicously does not. the wonders of science...and photoshop.

the sex pistols should've made a second cd.

i wanna cover some ramones songs...and some sex pistols songs. but i don't know how to play anything. and piano isn't in any of those songs anyway. i'll be the singer. i know people who play everything else. i can do a good fake british accent. you still know its fake, but it works.

...woops, i lied...tired again. hrm... i should do something about that. sleep.

"event","i'm kind of in a rut. its odd. i guess i've been in a rut for a while. since near the end of last year in fact. it's just that i'm recognizing it now. which is probably worse. but, eh. music is nice. i need to meet someone outside of the group. i know there are people outside the group, i should meet one.

i think people shouldn't find out about this, this journal. i think i need something to myself, something mine. i guess that's what my tangible journal is for, well that's more for writing down random thoughts to practice penmenship and other things.

if people read this they're gonna think i'm .a. winey, which i'm not...; .b. a fucking nut, but i'm trying to keep that a secret; .c. going to shoot myself in the head, but people shouldn't worry, i'll buy a ticket to san francisco before things come to things.

ok, now i'm tired. its seven. i obviously need rest.

at times it seems like i just can't do it anymore, like i'll be unable to get up in the morning, or unable to shower, or unable to dress, or.... like everything is a speed bump. every little part of my day...varying in size...is just another stop to get to...to what? i really don't know at this point. the weekend? afterschool? friends? sleep would be an answer but not a satisfying one. sleep is supposed to support the cause, not be the cause.

there was this one writer, i forget his name, he would writing things without capital letters. at all. his name, his stories, everything, no capitals. only the word god. which i find interesting, annoying to read, but interesting. i understand his reasoning as a religious nut, as was everyone under the sun in his time. but that seems to bring up the surprising fact that inorder to do something radical, something completely out of line, outside of the box, they need religious backing. or so it seems to me. 'god came to me in a dream and told me to...,' from the most outrageous to the most horrible acts, its seems god has had a hand in it. and i don't mean in the omnipotent, all powerful way either. it. is. ridiculous.

spell check, why would you want to spell check a juornal? its for you, right? so what the hell do you care if its spelled wrong, if anything it'll make you reminicse about how you used to spell reminisce wrong. spell check...that's when you know its not a journal, its a show. hey, this is how i feel...come look. it has then become a stage for melodrama.

i don't hate my life, i'm tired.

i should be reviewing, reading, looking over, everything. i'm not a scholar, i'm a fraud, i'm a fake, a 'poser'...i came to central on false pretenses. i said hey central if you let me in i'll do fantastic...so. much. for. that.

i like this. yes, i said it again, i like this whole journal thing. still reading this? well, that's your problem. i'm getting to experiment with puntuation and its effect on how we read things. its. odd. but. each. period. is. a. mental. stop. sign. that last sentence sounded stilted didn't it, even if only in your head.

i should get more music, all kinds of music. i should get more piano music, not necessarily the classical stuff. infact i think i should shy away from the classical stuff, just so i can see the other, lesser known side of the piano. i already have ben folds, that's a start. the bad plus is another good start, but i should go out and find other beautiful examples of the possiblities presented by the piano. ryhthm and melody in one instrument, now that's something.

i could never cut my arms...or person. now, i bring this up not because i am or was contemplating it, its inconcieveable for me, unless under threat of death, or worse torture. just thinking about the feeling...cold edge through skin...if i ever need to do that just to feel, or feel the need to, i'll take a step back, and leave life. no not kill myself, leave my life as it is now. just go away. not forever, everyone returns to their birthplace eventually.

"event","I think I like this whole livejournal thing. i can type pretty quickly. that helps. i'm no longer diliriously tired, as i was yesturday. that's good. i've decided i'm not going to capitalize anything, at all. if you have trouble following, serves you right for reading my private journal. so anyway on to more pressing matters, like i'm going to get piano lessons soon. as if i havn't pointed out who i was enough, i'm getting piano lessons...figure it out yet? six letters. anyway, if you're reading this you probably got it from mr.never-wears-a-shirt, so you know already. isn't that exciting. hrm...new paragraph.

so, i'm depressed, i know its sounds drastic, but i am. i have been for...years. but it is a part of being a teenager, something about the hormones, ramped up homework, and exposure to girls romanticly...sparks fly and depression is the product. however, this is nothing new, and neither is the reason, the only thing that changes over time is the girl. i'm in a bit of a catch-22 as far as girlfriends, see apparently you need to spend time with a person before you go out with them. me personally, i spend most/all of my free time with my friends, all of which, girls and boys, are very happy in their friendship status and don't much care for much more. this always leads me to a train of thought where i fancy spending time with other people, people who i can go out with, but the main problem is always that my friends are great, even if some of their friendships result in unrequited love, i'll move on. I'm pretty flexible. 

I just had another thought. what if i make my entries so long that no one will want to read them? they'll take one look at the lower caps paragraphs that never end and just say 'fuck it'. 

back to depression/girls, i'm unlucky with that. that whole situation, no luck there. i'm not necessarily lucky or unlucky in life per se, but when it comes to romance i always seem to come up snake eyes. but that's ok, because this is my life and i have to live it, romance, no romance."

"event","Ow...today hurts. Yesturday didn't hurt....why today? I guess it takes a day for things to set in like....now isn't the time. People should read this without my knowledge. Nobody inparticular. Just because its inevitable anyway. I am tired. I don't think I could say it enough to explain how I feel. I. am. tired. this only seems to magnify all the other problems that I have right now...sigh....sighsighsigh.....

I'm to tired to be doing this whole....'being awake' thing.

'bags under his eyes, slumped in his chair, barely able to lift his hands enough to type he stares blankly at the screen before him. a though runs through his head...'why'. but he knows why, he knows all to well, and it hurts. squinting at the screen he responds to yet another girl who is just outside his grasp. but weren't they all? he hears the bird clock from the kitchen cherp out eight times. no more for today. he can't handle it today. hopefully tomorrow, tomorrow holds renewed promises that were broken today. hopefully.'

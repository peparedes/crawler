Freshman year is over and I survived like so many before and I am sure so many after.  Minnesota was in fact cold, but I love it nonetheless.  I have tentatively decided on majors and thus am taking summer school, the only way to graduate in anything even remotely resembling 4 years.  

I still spend most of my time planning trips.  Some (San Francisco) a bit more successful than others (Winnipeg), but all good fun, although this was sometimes provided solely by the fact that we could legally purchase liquor.  

I forgot how good a distraction livejournal was from studying.  I should employ this more often.   But as I do have a chem test tomorrow, I should get back to my significant figures and mole ratios and percent yields and other things.  Unbalanced equations call to me."

However, this time I am going to the Frozen North instead of the Wet North so I suppose that counts as different.

I've quit my job for good; unemployment is better than I thought, although now I don't have the excuse of work to evade awkward hang-out-ing.  I try to use packing as my new excuse but, sadly, it doesn't have the same weight.  I have been packing, a bit in advance, and thus have no shirts worth wearing in my closets anymore, and have been reduced to lurching around like a badly dressed zombie as I tear my room apart looking for things like hangers, etc. 

My new computer came, it is yellow and has been christened Roger Mexico.  It is lightweight and clunks a lot less than the old one.  I got married (ish) to Julie and turned my mouth black with various black-frostinged things.  

I am all in a dither about what books to bring with me for my first semester; other than the dictionary, MLA handbook, u.s.w.  I know that realistically I will have no time to read or sleep or whatever but will feel awkward if I don't have anything on my bookshelf (which I still need to buy).  So far I have managed to stick half a dozen books in a box and then take them out again.

Instead of being productive, I sat in my room and wrote a horrible paper on ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"" and read more T.S. Eliot than was probably healthy.  

My goal for the next week is to be out of the house as much as possible, and when not outside the house to stay in my room, playing music and reading books that my family would probably not approve of (i.e. anything that is not about thermocouples or sub-zero vapourization or something).  I think that there are only so many times that one can answer the question ""Where are you going to college?"" without going spare.  I had hoped to simply record my reply on a tape so that instead of talking I could press play and wander away instead of holding conversations, but my mother was not supportive, and as a consequence I can't find recording devices of any sort.  

The other thing that I will be asked with frequency is how my love life is going, while the rest of the family waits with baited breath in the wings to hear my response and then dissect it.  On this front, I am resolved to tell everyone that I am becoming a nun.  At this point, their innate dislike of most things Catholic will kick in and I will be left alone for the remainder of their visit.

Lincoln is making me feel like a claustrophobe.  Everyone knows everyone, and in my paranoia I feel that I will be discovered as knowing them all.  Not that this would affect anything really, would it.  But in my mind it would be the worst thing ever.  No more anonymity.  Probably just paranoia and bad luck--<i>these people do not know or care who I know</i>--but still unhelpful to leading a balanced, healthy lifestyle (which is my goal, dontchaknow).

I was motivated enough when I came back to change the film in my camera, but then got too frustrated by having taken pictures of everything twice before and feeling too crotchety to flatter my friends by taking their pictures.  I ended up looking through the massive folders of England on my computer and pinning all my hopes on an indistinct date three months from now.

It was worse when I gave it to my mother though--she's just finishing up three days of lying in bed making noises from pain/hallucination.

Its a fun time.

I've started CID and Buisness Law, and also realized that I actually have to do my homework, what with Math being first period and all that.  I have no normal size classes--5 classes are tiny, 1 is absurdly huge [I realize that this only adds up to six classes, but I really actually don't know what size Newspaper is].

I spent break going sinkhole hunting, eating cheesecake, and wandering around cemetaries where I am related to pretty much everybody bueried there before 1950.  Oh, the Ozarks.

However, between us and the library, an Administrator lay in wait, hoping to catch those troublemakers, walkie-talkie brandished high.  
We approached, cautiously, and attempted to slip by.  No dice, as he with his considerable girth was blocking the doorway.  Thus, the Interrogation began.

Administrator:  Where are you two going?
Katy: The Media Center
Me: [nearly at the same time] The Library
Administrator:  Well! Media Center or Library, you better get your stories straight and decide which one you're going to, or else you can't go through.  So, which one are you going to?
Me: [on the verge of hysteria, with exaggerated arm waving] Both!  At the same time!

Well, we were waved through.  Upon reaching the library/media center/destination I proceeded to attack people in the vague hopes that one of them would shower sedatives on me, but to no avail.  
Ah, School.  We're back.

Other than that, I am now legally able to get a driving license (although that won't happen anytime in the near future) and I also a received a How To Be Asian Birthday Kit from Madame Shuqiao that both brightened my day and brainwashed me (both good, although I may have a tendency to now be distracted by shiny objects and have an immense fondness for the colour red).

Nothing serious either time, mind you--not even visible damage on either car--but still enough to make the drivers turn on their emergency blinkers, get out of their respective cars, and shamble over to inspect the vehicles and dart shady looks at each other, each poised with a cell phone in hand.

I don't mean to cause these things, but being as pedestrian, I do like to get to my abode everyday (otherwise I would be sleeping at school which really is not an appetizing prospect).  To do so, I must cross the street.  Mind you, I always cross when the little light says WALK etc. etc., mostly because I do not want to end up as puree courtesy of an SUV.  But occasionally, a vehicle will wish to turn while I am crossing.  They (due to the traffic rules) must stop, as I have the right of way.  I honestly feel bad about holding up traffic, and try to hurry across.  I do, I do.

But, apparantly, the mental processes of some drivers go along these lines ""Despite the fact that all the cars in front of me are not moving and have their brake lights on <i>does not mean</i> that they are actually stopped, since the light is green.  Therefore they must be moving and ohnoitsanothersolidcarthatisnotgoingtodisappear--"" sqee-crunchcrash.  Wince.

Second Pre-Calc and Physics tests: not so fab

However, the new Franz Ferdinand CD has come into my life and given me direction again.  Or at least given me something good to dance to.

I'm taking my driver's test tommorrow.

"event","I have just returned from my first foray into non-LPS education this year.  That's right, Southeast Community College Driver's Education!  Thanks to the enlightening information bestowed upon me, I am ready to face the world.  What did I learn, you ask?  I learned.... Red means Stop.  Green means Go.

....
Why?!  Why meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?
However, it is nice to know that twice a week for two hours I will be able to have intellectual superiority over a roomfull of people.  Its not much consolation, but I take what I can get.  (Actually, there is a remarkably high percentage of not-insupportable people.  We'll just see if they remain that way after six weeks.)  Also, I was asked if I was on drugs.  Why do people ask me that?!  Why?!  Do I give off an aura of ""hey check it out i just took some mind altering substance a few minutes ago""?  Psh.  Psh.

But yeah. 
I had too much fun with my first photography assignment for Newspaper.  And I used up another roll of film.  Anyone up for photographic expedition this weekend?

"event","The second week of school is winding down.  I've managed to start out my junior year with masses of homework and also the Orange Plague.  Fun times all round, eh?

However, I am managing well with the homework, and with Super-chow forcing orange juice down my throat I will soon recover from the plague or die trying.

I have been forced to remember what 6:15 in the morning looks like.  People may rave about the beauties of the sunrise, but the sun seems to lose some of its glory when it is rising as I am traipsing through a golf course getting the lower quarter of my pants soaked with dew.

Other than that--I got henna done on my hands! yay!

Wow, I think that perhaps I have even outdone myself on complete randomness.

LATER:
Just got back from a combination shoe shopping/motorcycle ride with my father.  Never tried it before?  you should!  its liberating (or something)"

I compensated by agreeing to go shopping with Erin and buying the world's Most Comfortable Pants in the name of ""Things I Really Need I Swear Mum Really"".

<lj-cut text=""And just because"">
Directions: Type ""(your name) is"" (with the quotes) into a Google search; cut-and-paste the first 10 responses that work.

Just pull the answers right out of the excerpt google shows you, don't click the link and search around.

The only rule is that each one has to start with ""(your name) is.""

1. Susanna is ONE Today, Jun 11.
2. Susanna is to make an appointment to meet the Count.
3. Susanna is in the closet but the door cannot be opened.
4. Susanna is also active in committees to make a difference such as one that does research on Muscular Dystrophy and other genetic diseases
5. Susanna is a Liar!
6. Susanna is located in the Catalonia region of Spain on the Costa Maresme.
7. Susanna is accosted by two old lechers.
8. Susanna is an apartment which sleeps three people.
9. Susanna is now forced into the role of a Gothic heroine.
10. Susanna is stuck for the long haul (which turns out to be nearly two years).

but if I'm accosted by 2 lechers, dosen't that mean that I am two cows richer?

"event","You find some interesting things by flipping through the Lincoln paper:
In the article ""Swaziland girls celebrate end of sexual activity ban"":

""During the ban, Swazi girls were instructed to wear the scarves as a sign of their chastity.  If an umchwasho [banned-under 18] girl was approached for sex by a man, she was expected to throw her tassles at his homestead, obliging his family to forfeit a cow."" 

So next time you are solicited by an unwanted male, throw a scarf at his house and you will become one cow richer!

So other than that, life's been nice, although vaguley awkward.  the whole summer-coming-to-an-end thing, I guess.  My life is also further complicated with having to deal with 25 small hyper children at 8:00 every morning at the zoo.  My foot still has not recovered from getting flattened by an obese child carrying a backpack full of books.

Random thing learned lately:
Yes, it <i>is</i> quite acceptable to cook pasta in a wok.  With chopsticks.

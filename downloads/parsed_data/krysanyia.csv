"event","Life, pursuit of happiness...doesn't exist. Life is filled with adversity after adversity.  You are given what you can handle...then trials to test your very limits.  Sometimes you fail, sometimes you succeed and the rest of the time you just pray that you survive.

New job, new hell.  Don't try to make new friends.  Just live in a cave and do what you have to do to make it to the next day.  Hope? Ha!  Lost that.  Faith in people? HA. Lost that too.  What do I have?  Sometimes I wonder about that. I have my faith.  I have my son.  Other than that, it is subjective.  The faith part is hard enough to live with.  My son is 500 miles away and I am living alone.  I hate being alone. Something that seems to happen to me no matter how many people are living in the same residence.

A friend told me recently I am too much to handle. Too much woman.  What the fuck does that mean?  That they are not strong enough...well frankly I don't think anyone is.  Not because I am some sort of powerhouse...hell no.  Because mostly I am who and what I am.  Go me.  Well that can all take a flying leap.

I am going to do what I can to not only survive, but thrive.  I push myself, sometimes too hard according to my best friend...but hey I have to do well don't I? I have to succeed. I have to care for those around me.  It doesn't matter that people around me don't care for me or about me.  What is important is that I do what I know is right and help everyone that is around me.  Even though we might fail, we have to try.  We have to be honest and open, we have to be strong in our convictions...When we lose faith we lose direction.  With faith we have a purpose and can serve others as well as ourselves.

Well anyways, I am tired of some people; tired of being alone..sleeping alone.  But I know in the end something positive will happen. It has too.  That is a part of Faith."

I spent the first night in my new home last night.  No kids screaming, no fighting, no slamming of doors or stomping of feet.  No smelly diapers, no dirty sinks, no having to sleep in PJs (yeah that is the big one.)  It is such a great place. Okay so I only have a bed, a dresser, mirror and nightstand.  Oh yeah and my 12 boxes of clothes. What a clothes horse? How dare you!  At least I only brought 4 pairs of shoes instead of all of them...Oh hush you!  I am a teacher, we are supposed to dress cool.  

Everyone loves my outfit today.  Okay I am ignoring the person that said I looked like a blueberry. I LOVE this outfit.  And no it is not low cut..well at least part of it.  So there.

Well the administration is very pleased with me here at work.  They keep saying how proud they are and that we get points for funding because I took them to state WOOHOO.  I have to call hotels for next friday too. Weeeeeeeee.  

Long nights, longer days...but at least I will have my own refuge.  I won't have any net access at home for a week or two, but other than that I will do well."

I h ave money to get a place to live so the apartment shopping has begun.  I am rather happy about that because that means I will have PRIVACY once again. Oh what treasured gift silence is.  I think that I will do my best to contain the pure joy at having a place of my own close to work and school...oh wait those are the same things.

*bouncy bouncy*

Yes I have chugged an entire mug of coffee.  That makes me perky werky.  

Well I got my grades for my first assignment in my new graduate class yesterday.  I got a 100% on the message board assignment and I got a 98% on the essay assignment.

Rehearsals are going well.  Of course the students are finding out that I demand perfection when on the stage. I have had to teach them to be professionals.  You know it is good when they are tired and sweaty and go home and pass out...it is a conspiracy. Muhahahahaha.

Well I need to go role play a bit and relax before I get dressed and head off to school for the day. I should be  really nice to my students. I think they will like that. Oh I am nice and they try to walk all over me..hmmm I guess I better be a bitch to them."

"event","Wow.  What a busy few months I have had.

It started the middle of January when I got a call asking to go to North Carolina for a job interview. I ended up interviewing at two other places while I was down in the area.  The first job that asked me to come down declined me, yet i got a job at a school in Virginia doing what I reallly wanted to do. Theatre.  Of course I am also teaching English, but that is okay since I love English as well.

Now I am the new Theatre Director as well as teacher. I love my job and my students. They are great.  Of coures they are trying at times but in the end they are worth it.  When I got the job, they told me ""you are the drama coach, you have a competition this friday"" Oh DEAR!  Well I watched the play and cringed, wanting to find the old teacher and beat her for fucking up the play so badly that it looked like fourth graders on stage.  I had to reblock/redirect the entire play.  It snowed so the compeition was postponed.  YEAH!  More time to rehearse with the new blocking.  Well we went to the district compeition after two weeks and we won first place.  Off to Regionals we go. WHat they are in a week? Oh DEAR.  We had Regionals Saturday, we took second place and now we are heading off to the state competition  in two weeks.  That is the first time in this school's history that they have ever gotten that far in drama. 

A brag point. I went from no job, no life, no hope to having a job that I love and kicking ass in it. I did in three weeks what the other teacher couldn't do in three years.  Good t hing I have really good acting students.

This week I will be apartment hunting.  Then I could have privacy again since I have been staying with a friend in her household.  Boy is it crowded!"

"event","Ever wake up and just wonder....Where is the coffee? I mean yes we all have our vices and all. I mean  Icould be addicted to something rather nasty (Hey don't you dare say coffee is nasty or I will come and beat you.), but instead I have to have my wonderful flavourful caffiene loving coffee. And I am not talking something like folgers..OMG that stuff is gross. I am talking REAL coffee. Yes the coffee you get in those little bags that cost a small forturne in comparison to mud.  Some people who know me...know better to even talk to me before coffee.  Yeah, okay so I am a little cranky before coffee.  Like right now?  Well Not telling. Well anyways.  Never go to bed a little depressed and thinking about the Combine. I dreamed I made a city and it got toasted in a beta lava flow and I was killed.  Boy was I mad in my dream.  Don't ask. I am insane.  Now if I could only find my coffee."

"event","Do you ever wonder why people say ""Don't worry it will get better""?  I have recently.  Okay, life recap and then maybe someone can tell me when life will get better.  I was sexually abused from age 2 to abut age 10.  My mother was so busy doing drugs that she totally ignored that her only child was being touched, fondled and forced to perform oral sex on even her own cousins.  Then mother came off drugs and turned mean thus enjoying her favourite past time: beating the shit out of her daughter.  I feared to even tell her when I was attacked as a shild on the playground for the one time I did she yelled and screamed at me and started hitting me until I begged her to stop.  She would yell so loud the people across the street from us would hear her.  And we were in our own home with the doors and windows shut.  Then the mental abuse. ""I could have had a life if I hadn't had you."" ""You were the biggest mistake in my life.""  Fun for a twelve year old, no?  Then the ""Oh I don't know what I would do without you"" line.  Okay which is it mom? She couldn't make up her mind.  No wonder I turned into an evil bitch.  

After High school...Freedom!...or was it?  Okay I did some stupid shit.  Moving in with a guy 16 years older than me and he had two kids.  Yeah that was smart.  Oh he was also an alcholic.  Okay Stupidity reigned for a year.  We won't go into detail.  Too embaressing.  No one wants to hear about me drunk off my ass and sitting on the floor wondering what day it was.

Then another year of living like an idiot.  Don't remember alot of it but it wasn't smart.  And No, it wasn't drug related.  Tried something once, found it stupid.  Never did again.  Why? See above.  okay met a guy.  Yeah he was married, but his wife was sleeping with the men next door to them.  How do I know? She told me and tried to get me to sleep with her spouse so she didn't have too.  Okay he was cute...and one night we did. And he left her.  She stalked me.  Okay another stupid moment.  God I can't believe I was that dumb.  We dated for 5 months before he moved out of my house one night without even a note. Lovely.

Then I joined a Ministry. What? This bad girl working for God? Yes, I did.  while I might have strayed from time to time..okay a hell of a lot.  But I was fucked up, I still believed I had a purpose. I mean I had to have one right? I had survived abuse, neglect and torment...Life will get better.

Nearly four years in a travelling drama ministry I felt like I had aged fifteen years.  I was on the road 9 months out of the year, slept on church floors, in vans, sometime in people's homes...okay never get pnemonia and bronchitis while staying with people who have a 4 year old with a barney theme in your room.  108 temperature and barney do not mix. I still have nightmares ten yearts later.  I learned a lot about faith and trust in t hose years.  I never got paid and always got sent to the really neglected areas...Got slapped by one unit leader, threatened by another...Nearly killed one.  Thank god we were in a church.  Okay I was a walking basket case.  All this pent up anger and no positive outlet anymore.  Since I had always used RPGs to vent my hate.

I went home after being gone for a few years.  My mother went out of town the entire time I was there, thanks mom.  Guess who I ran into? Yep married guy.  He was divorced, still loved me...yeah...stupidity reigned again...what did I do? Married him 9 months later.

weee now married, nice house, nice car, plenty of money because he worked at a mill and made quite a bit by now...had everything...but attention.  *dusts her trophy*  after a year and a half I finally concieved.  I had thought WOW I could have a child to raise and love....sure.  Ran into my father.  Oh yes, the alcholic ex-convicted american indian.  This was a very bad year for me. Very bad....My half brother, my only living brother..(my other half brother dying of SIDs) commits suicide.  My own father asks my spouse to go to a whorehouse with him while I was pregnant ""he shouldn't have to see you on his day off.  He should be able to get some while you are fat.""  Thanks dad, love you too.  Son born: Dec 21.  Died: Dec 25. Merry Christmas.

My so-called best friend:  8 weeks later calls ""I am pregnant I want you to be my birthing coach.""  Oh yes, she is unmarried, has one illigitmate child, and is a chain smoker and caffiene addict..Okay god why do they get to have kids and I can't?  I eventually had to get a restraining order against her for stalking me and calling me and threatening me.  Gee thanks.  


I get AOL to find people to talk about Babylon 5 with.  I loved that show. I met some of my best friends there and 7 years later still chat with them.  They went through hell with me.  I find my spouse online...going to gay chat rooms. He tells me he d oesn't love me and never did and that he is gay.  Oh weeee blow to my ego.   So I went for a drive...13 hours later I flipped my car end over end and rolled it...both at least 5 times they say.  I was in the hospital 900 miles from home.  The only people to send flowers or call? My B5 friends...my family ""how could you do that to your husband."" HELLO????  ""Get over losing your child it was a year ago"" FUCK YOU.  Okay I left.  Moved to new Orleans.  had fun.  miss my adopted dad and bro.  Love them.

Met my current spouse online okay that was fun.  We decided to date and he lived an hour from a cousin of mine.  We dated and 2 months later I found myself what my doctors said would never happen again: Pregnant.  The single joy in my life.  My son Joseph. I love him more t han anything, even when he is a pain in the ass.

We were in the mliitary, okay spouse was.  We had to leave because of bullshit, he got kicke dout and we were forced to move to ohio.  now I thought..it couldn't be that bad could it? OH boy...was I wrong.  I went back to Uni so I could get a job.  raising a toddler while struggling for ends meat, going to school....yeah I can do this.  I am good at surviving.

Made it through uni and got honours.  So time to get a job! Yeah! okay...so they have no jobs here. I can't get work.  I have huge bills I can't pay.  Some asshole shoots my cat with a field arrow (Murry is doing great and we were on fox news!) And today at the craft fair...I decided to sell anything I could so I could pay my bills....I spent 9 hours and made $8.

So...I skipped over my father faking his own death, getting abused by kids at school and the normal bullshit, the rapes, the beatings from boyfriends(See stupid years)  When does it get better?"

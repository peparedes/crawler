"event","So I'm having open heart surgery on Nov. 17th to fix/replace my Tricuspid valve. 
I have RBBB & Severe symptomatic Tricuspid regurg.. & enlarged heart (forget wich chamber?). & my blood clots too easily.

I recently learned that most people end up doing great after surgery! -getting back their energy & returning to an active physical life.  Some only moderate improvement,  but still better than before.  (8% mortality) & some have complications.) 

My surgeon doesn't know exactly how bad it is until he's ""in there"", so we don't know if it's going to be a repair or a relplacement.  I'll be really happy either way.

I'm getting a Bovine valve.  it's beef  haha!  no, really, it's a cow valve.
The good thing about a tissue valve (as opposed to a mechanical valve), is that I don't have to take blood thinner the rest of my life.
The bad thing is that I have to have it replaced every 10-15yrs.

I first learned I had heart disease at a routine checkup in 2003 ..from there I was sent to a Cardiologist but was told I would be 60yrs old before I would need surgery, to get checked every 1-2yrs and I was on my way. 
The regurg. turned 'moderate', Dec. 05, I've had a Cardiologist since with checkups every 3-6 months. 
July of 2006 I went in just for an Echo and came out scheduling my heart surgery.... I was like ""Hey, thanks for the warning!"" haha. 


So I put it off as long as I could.  Nov. 17th at 5am!  eek!  That's only 20 days away!
(SCARY!!)

I've been deciding if I should decorate my Christmas tree before then? ... hmmmm ... despite looking really silly having a 7' tree in my house 1 month too early, holiday decorating is something I go a bit crazy with and don't want to miss it due to not feeling up to it.  hmmmmmmm"

Do not watch the Stepford Wives as hot as Nicole Kidman may be

Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day... or suffer the consequences of looking like a bloated beach whale

and

Do not hang up on people no matter how annoyed you may be... you never know if you'll get to speak to them again"

"event","I can't even hear a song without getting a huge fucking knot in my throat. I wake up with this feeling... it's torture.  They say life is like a roller coaster ride... BUT I HATE CARNIVALS AND THAT INCLUDES STUPID ASS ROLLER COASTERS!!!!! so when will this shit end. Of course all of this has to do with a boy... the most extraordinary boy I've ever met. People have always said I'm a asshole, and to be quite honest I liked that.  Life was fine until I met him. I'll never forget the day I saw him.  It was so stupid!!! It was like a movie... in slow motion.  There he was walking right toward me wearing a white shirt that said PLAYER in big bold letters.  I was sitting with my friends Ruby and Chema and my exact words were ""Oh my God... there goes the guy of my dreams forever and ever AMEN!""  At that point both of my bitch friends bet me that no matter what, I could never get him to give me the time of day.  The bet was on, and for 10 bucks I started plotting a way to get him to notice me. 
It was easier than I ever imagined. All I did was kiss up to his friend spoiling him with candy, and jokes and before I knew it... I had Erik eating out of the palm of my hand.  It all happened so fast. First, we sat together, then the exchange of numbers.  Next, was the first kiss that unfortunately for me is a big blur.  I was nervous, therefore I was drunk. If I could turn back time, I swear I would never have expected I would feel about him the way I do now. 
It was like three weeks into our ""talking period"" when he told me he loved me. Three WEEKS!!! I remember like if it were yesterday.  I was laying in bed trying hard to sleep because I knew he had go out with his friends.  After hours of tossing and turning, my cell begins to vibrate, and I roll over with a cocky smile from ear to ear knowing he was dying to talk to me.  I answered, and like nothing the wordS ""I think I'm falling in love with you"", just rolled out of his mouth.  Being the bitch I am, instead of enjoying it, I replied with ""You don't know what your talking about. I'll call you tomorrow"". But he was falling in love with me, and although I've never until this moment admitted it... I was ALREADY in love with him. 
From that point on we were inseparable. 
Our two year anniversary was January 9th.  We spent it in our brand new apartment with our ""daughter"" Kennedy.  She's our pug. 
Today, I'm alone writing this pathetic entry in this journal as an attempt to release some of my pain.
Erik is not just some boy to me anymore... he's my husband.  I don't think it is possible to love anything more than I love him.  Without him, I feel like there is no air for me to breathe, or nothing worth even waking up for. He and I have been through more together in our two year relationship than many have endured in their entire lives. Finally, we had each other, our home, our daughter, our families, and our future perfectly mapped out when something had to intervene.
It's been almost a month now, and we have about another year to go. You see, my husband is a Marine on his way to Iraq. 
I don't have much more to say for tonight...
If your reading this, just always remember no matter how rough things get between you and your loved ones... just always be thankful that they are there. Be thankful you can see them, yell at them, or even hit them if you want, but just be thankful they are THERE."

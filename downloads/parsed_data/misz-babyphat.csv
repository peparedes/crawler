been updating lately! a whole lot of drama has
been goin' on in my life w/ <s>nick</s> n them
kids. he calls me the other day FLIPPING out cuz
i have ""j--call me when you get home =D"" in my a/m
he's calls-YEAH I HOPE YOUR BOY JIM CAN TAKE YOU 2
PROM CUZ IM NOT! and hangs up. i was like WtF?! so
i try to call back like wtf is your problem and he
won't listen i just got so pissed off n shit i 
started cryin' n nikki came to get me like 2 min. 
later n we went out -> it ended up being a really
fun night! me nikki n sarah went to the mall n 
walmart n drove around n did stupid shit. n i 
basically told nick wtf was up i was like look we
DON'T go out -> and this exActly why. n then i 
proceeded to expose all of his dirt to him that he
didn't think i knew about. i was like yeah i LOVE 
how you flip out on me for having a guy in my a/m
but yet you can go fuck 2 other girls the past 2 
weekends AND make out w/ 1 of my good friend's 
[kristy] i wasn't pissed at her cuz she was drunk n
i really didn't care cuz i don't like nick its just
more for me to use against him =D n he called n
apologized n shit but im still not on good terms w/ 
him cuz that shit was just completely uncalled for.
so yeah i haven't chilled w/ him for a while n w/e he
calls if i miss it i dont call back--and if i do answer
it im just like yeah im busy--shit i don't care i'll
BE shady about it if he's gonna act like that! but yeah
on a good note, everything else has been pretty good 
[*knock on wood*] me n jimmy are still together =D it's 
about to be 1 month tuesday =D awww i love him!! but
yeah it's been the same old shit in my life lately..i
worked down at the consecion stand at the park w/ sarah
last night we made like $15 in tips the whole night lol
so we both got like $7 n got paid $5 an hour--not bad
considering i was there from 4:30-10:00 =D so that's
gonna be nice--im gonna work down there alot prob. +

"event","soo i haven't updated in a minute! sorry girls!
alot has been going on, well nothing good at
least =/ here has been my weekend:

Friday- 
went to a party at steves house---it was weeeak
cara got crushed n sarah got tipsy--i drove so 
therefore i didn't drink >:O but im sayin' cara
was funny as hell with it. we left n went to mc
donalds for food and she couldnt get back into
the car--we saw matt n his mom [who w0rks w/ mine]
n she was like =O omg their drunk! lmao i was
so done. so then we drove around for a lil--n i
dropped sarah off at her house since she wasnt 2
bad n then me n cara drove around a lil longer cuz
she wuz super crushed. trynna climb out my sunroof
n shit! and then grabbed the wheel n we were swervin
n shit n i was like whoa whoa cops!?!? and then 
she stopped lol and then she called jimmy n meech 
talkin wreckless lmao it was funny as hell. then we
just came back here cuz my mom would be cool w/ her
being drunk. and she knocked a picture off my wall
at like 1 and it made a big ass bang and everyone 
woke up lmao. and then she walked back up to her house
after she was cool and went to bed lol

Saturday-
hmm VERY interesting day-- >:O well to start nikki ty n i
went to starbucks in the afternoon, we took ty home nikki
went to her house for an hour to shower n shit n i went 2
hammies while she did that cuz i havent seen hammie in 
forever and thats like my best friend, so we just talked n
shit it was fun. n then i picked nikki up n we drove out 2
the mall, n my mom called like come home now so i didnt get
2 get anything. and then i came home n eat n cara called like
lets go 2 the mall i need to get a bra. n my mom wuz like no
u were out there 2wc already but then she was like ok fine w/e
so we go out, see matt n his friend catie walk in w/ them n
shit n then cara n me go to victorias secret, she bought a
reg. black bra and she bought me this hot blue set! haha cuz
im broke as shit and it was her moms credit card n her mom 
wouldnt care. so then on the way home it wuz stop n go traffic
n i bumped into this girl infront of me and cracked my front
fender. nothing to real, its a really small crack but the whole
thing will need replaced n that blows cuz its gonna be mad $
n her car we will have 2 pay for n my insurance is gonna be
out my ass now! >:O she was driving a 96 corsica n her mom
hasnt called yet n she didnt seem mad about the damage so yea
im hoping they dont even bother to get it fixed. there was a very
slight dent n a very faint scratched. my cars deff. worse 
than hers =/ so yahh my parents r pissed, i understand why--im
a dumbass who cant drive! >:O so yeah now its deff. gonna be 
over a $1000 for my car let alone hers. and my dads gonna try
to pay for it himself but if he cant then insurance will have 2
and our premniums r gonna be super high >:O

Sunday-

and stuff n just cut up, it was fun...then after
the party we went back to caras and jimmy hugged 
me good bye n stuff--cara and linds wanted us to
kiss so0o bad but we were both like ok their both
right there lol so we didnt =/ oh well next time ;D
and the thing is i think lindsay [not the 1 that was
previously mentioned--this is drews lil sister--drew
is VERY good friends w/ nick]didnt say anything to
nick about me being w/ jimmy cuz he never asked me 
bout it =D thats so awesome that she didnt nark! lol
i was like wow thank yo0o0o0ou! cuz i picked her up
and took her to the party also since she was going
anyway. but that was it, ty and nikki came w/ us too
and ty like checked jimmay out and like hit on him
and he laughed =x cuz he said IM his girl =D so yahh
Sunday:
wow long day--i woke up at 12 stayed home n like cleaned
n was bored off my ass till cara came home at 2--i walked
up her house n we just hung out and stuff and then i came
home at like 5-ish and i walk in and my moms on the phone
w/ 911 and my dads just sitting on the floor and i was like
OMG! and i didnt know what was going on. and while the 
ambulance was on its way my dad said he had a sharp pain in
his head for about an hour and then he was getting the dog
his food and got really dizzy n like fell down on the floor
and my moms was in the kitchen w/ him cooking dinner and was
like whats wrong whats wrong and he told her and she thought
he might be starting to have a stroke or a heart attack so
she hurried up and called 911 so they came and his blood
pressure was elevated a little bit and they were like go and
have this checked. so he took the ambulance and me my mom n
bro left like 5 min later, and i was getting pissed at my mom
cuz she was like driving fast but she only ran 1 red light n
shit and if i was driving i would have blown them all n prob.
got us killed cuz im wreckless to begin w/ [so maybe its a 
good thing i didnt drive lol] but yea like she was taking 2
long for me so i was like dude common pass this guy and go 
through that light, so finally she did and we only got there
5 min. after the ambulance which was good, and they gave my
dad a CAT scan cuz they said everything was looking normal
there was no other symptoms except his bp was a lil high but
they wanted to make sure n we found out it was only a sinus
inffection THANK GOD! i was crying n shit like i dont know
what i would do w/o my dad i love him soo0o much, i would
be SO lost w/o him. so then we came home and he got a lil
pissed at me cuz before we left for the hospital i was so
pissed n scared that i looked at his cigarettes n was like
THESE FUCKING THINGS ARE PROBABLY THE CAUSE OF IT!! and 
started screaming and shit and tore them all up and broke off
all the filters and it was a brand new pack--but he wasnt
too mad =/ so the we came home ate and he has medicine, but
were still making him be careful like take time off work n
stop smoking n eat right n shit... and then i talked to
jimmay tonight when i got home and he said i was the 1 he 
really wanted n stuff n he made his mind up and he wants 2
be w/ me and cares for me alot, so he asked me back out =D
i said yes, im happy! haha well im out girls! night! un0z*'

"event","so yahh i dont think its gonna last w/ me
n jimmy <b>at all</b>...i can't say i didnt
expect or anything, i mean i know about his
past w/ <s>erica</s> and i know he loves her.
i have no idea why i think i can try n change
him. like he has told me he loves her, but 
then he says she had her chance w/ him n he
really likes me--but then again <i>like</i>
and <b>love</b> are 2 completely different 
things. i really don't want to put myself 
through this, so why am i trying? i just really 
really really really <i>really</i> like him =*(
but ugh w/e. our friend also told me to be on 
the look out cuz she doesnt want me to get hurt
but he said something along the lines of ""i think
i might do some bullshit saturday night for erica""
i think im just gonna tell him i don't want to see
him anymore...at all...i dunno i tried before n 
1 of us will just keep coming back. im so sick of
always getting fucked over or hurt w/ every guy i
try to be w/ that i really like. and i know he's 
going over her house sat. but he ""deff. wants to
come see you shawty"" [you as in me lol?] it's like
ok i understand your best friends but <b>dont</b>
make her your priority when your <b>girlfriend</b>
is only your option!?! and then he tells me last night
he doesnt want anything to change between us and i can
call him my boyfriend n shit but i have my freedom to
do w/e with other guys..just dont ruin him. im like WTF
is THAT supposed to mean?!?! its sounding like he doesnt
even really want to be with me, im just his back up. n
im <u>not</u> one to sit back and let the competition win.
and then this is his info: 
:-*


my drankin partner 8-)


I cannot forget her, my Mexican lover
with that and its strong, can mix her up with no other
her name Tequilla, we met in October
I hit her all the time, I can't sleep on your sofa
one hit and it's over, the girl's addictive

k the kissy face thing is for me--but the drankin partner
is for erica--and then he has those lyrics under her thing
I can't sleep on your sofa
one hit and it's over, the girl's addictive.....umm ok??
i seriously don't know what to do, i tried to talk to him
bout it before and he tells me not to worry bout it their
""just friends"" and ""she had her chance w/ me"" and shit n
im like ok so shes broken up w/ her boyfriend right now--
so who knows whats gonna happen?? and then i find out from
our friend he said that other shit about he might do some
dumbass shit w/ erica saturday night...ok yea i feel like
a little play toy, an option, i feel like im just there, like
im just a lil trophy or something? ugh..i dunno what to do
i like him so0o much but i dont want to go through this..."

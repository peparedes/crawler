I'm sure there are reasons that things went slowly, and I'm glad the administration has accepted blame for it, but I still thought this picture was a ZING, and so I had to put it up.

"event","I should be studying.

But first, a word about this weekend.  It was the biggest waste of time I have ever experienced for more than a few hours.  We travelled to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, as I posted earlier, and basically were given an awful tour of a retired aircraft carrier (awful because the ""guide"" didn't say more than ten words, just walked us around).  Then we went to this giant-ass machine shop, which was cool, but it's not as if we got useful knowledge for our project.  Then we had a 2-hour lunch break, and then finally approached our 1 hour of useful work (so described our itenerary).  The hour we were meant to have for meeting the lead engineers on the project consisted of a ten minute ""hi and how are you"" session with this guy who <i>clearly</i> was not in the mood to really talk or answer questions.  So essentially the whole reason for going for the weekend was constricted to this one hour session, which ended up being ten minutes.  Ugh.

The Cougar game also felt like a waste of time, as I could have been sleeping during it.  Now of course I love the Cougars beyond reason, but the game was BORING.  We decided it was necessary to develop a consistent, 4 or 5 yards-a-play offense, instead of relying on big 40 yard bomb passes, to keep us in games in the future against good teams - meaning that this game was our big chance to try out a new offensive look on a crappy team that wouldn't punish us for not executing properly.  Translation - slow moving offense, to the point that by the time we actually scored a touchdown on any given drive I had stopped caring.  It is worthwhile to note that had our offense been having this EXACT level of success against a relatively good team, it would have been great.  It just felt that if we were so much better than this team, we should have consistently broken big plays and made it exciting.  Oh well, we looked pretty good and I think we have a good chance to beat Oregon State.  

Anyways, back to studying!  yay..."

"event","Before I become productive, I thought I should mention that our apartment is now decorated.  Well, decorated in the sense that we have beer signs on one wall of our living room, artsy stuff on another (a street vendor's painting of the Seine River in Paris, as well as that crazy girl with the poodle), and Cougar posters (volleyball, soccer, football) on another wall.  Sadly, we no longer have a photo of Warf to greet us as we walk into the kitchen, since Adam owns it and took it with him.  However, Ricky has replaced it with this ridiculous picture that someone he knows actually used for his Senior picture in high school, in which he is pouring some liquid chemical from one beaker into another, looking very, um, scientific.  It's pretty funny, and is an inspiration to us all.  Also, Ricky and Jon are brewing and bottling their own beer, and it should be ready to drink in a couple weeks.  Hopefully it will turn out alright, they're pretty excited about it.

Okay, back to work!  Oh, one more thing: this reminds me of Adria, a LOT.

"event","For anyone who may get somewhat annoyed with me for being ""busy"" and not talking to them over the next few days, this is what things are looking like for me this week.

Wednesday: Ceramics quiz, Mechanics of Solids quiz, Metals HW due, Polymers HW due
Thursday:       Ceramics HW due (early), Ceramics Exam (early) both caused by the fact that we have                to travel to Bremerton for ME Senior Design Clinic, so the normally due Friday stuff is due Thursday before we leave.  
Friday:             Puget Sound Naval Shipyard project interviews and site tour (7AM to 4PM), then WSU Engineering Alumni convention in Seattle (Pier 66!)  (7-9PM)
Saturday:        Cougar game in Seattle, travelling home
Sunday:           Soccer (not really a chore I guess), extensive studying for ...
Monday:         Metals Exam, start grading homeworks for 301 (I'm sort of like a TA)
Tuesday:          Senior Thesis Progress Report Presentation, Spec. Report rough draft due for ME
Wednesday:   Polymers Exam, turn in graded homeworks for 301

The main problem with this is that I have Ceramics HW, Quiz, and Exam all happening within 24 hours of each other due to the unavoidable business trip to PSNS.  Then every moment this weekend that is not spent at PSNS, the Alumni Convention, or the WSU game should be spent studying for the two exams.  Bleh!  

On the plus side, the Cougar game should be enjoyable!  I've never been to the Seahawks stadium, where I'm told the Cougars play their Seattle game, so I'm definitely looking forward to that.  Oh, for anyone confused as to why WSU would play a game in Seattle, it's for the $$$.  We have a TON of alumni on that side of the state who can't always drive cross-state to Pullman of all places to watch a football game, so this is a good way for the Cougars to sell 65000 tickets or so and make all the West Side alumni happy.  At any rate, the game is unlikely to be on TV, so this way I get to watch all of the Cougar games either in person or on TV, since otherwise I probably wouldn't have justified the drive to Seattle solely for the game.  I also get the chance to go see Yellowcard (opened by Rufio) in concert in Spokane in a couple weeks, so that's pretty cool.  The day after that I am going home for the weekend to see some Christian group that does the Weird Al thing with pop music, but to Christian lyrics (which I think might be stupid, but could be okay).  I'm doing this mainly so Almighty MOM can be appeased and see my face for the weekend, but it should be good to go home anyways, the food is better there.  

So that's that, I will be busy for awhile so please no one take it personally if I don't talk much!  The only thing left to say is...

Let the games begin."

"event","Yay for Senior year!  Now if only it all would end this May.  I am heavily considering going to grad school here, we have this nifty BS/MS program where you go directly from BS to Masters in a year and a half.  I've <i>sort of</i> got a reason to stick around, though my reason will be here for three years after I graduate so I'll still have to kill some time somehow.  Maybe a Ph. D... but so much work!

Classes this year are a good mix of ""easy"" (yeah right) and ""ridiculous"".  For those who are interested (and don't care to look on <a href=""http://wsu.facebook.com/profile.php?id=27209565"">Facebook</a>), my classes are as follows:

MSE 401  Metals
MSE 402  Polymers
MSE 403  Ceramics
MSE 413  Mechanics of Solids (aka Physical Metallurgy)
MSE 425  Senior Thesis
ME   416  Senior Design Clinic

Mechanics of Solids is everything I hated about Mechanics of Materials (a CE class) and so much more.  I think the main reason I'm worried is that the professor is really old (ie set in his ways), really good at what he does, and has the midterm exams + quizzes worth 50% with the other 50% being the final exam.  Also, he doesn't think much of partial credit... gulp.  Polymers, ceramics, and metals do not worry me too much, they're really interesting and I like the professors.  Senior Thesis is just research and occasional progress report, more of an interesting time-consumer than ""hard work"", though I suppose some people consider research really hard.  It helps that I'm doing stuff on Ni-based superalloys, which is something I'm actually excited to learn about.  The ME class seems like it could be alright.  Outside companies approach WSU and ask for ME and MSE students to work on some project for them - ideally, they are more patient with us than if their own people did it, and in return we do the project fairly cheaply.  The project I am on is working with five other people is on developing a battery-powered pipe cutter for the Puget Sound Naval Shipyards' submarine maintenance facilities.  I think it will be fun, but this semester will get really busy in a hurry once that starts to get going.  

Other than class, I've been going to Pullman Baptist and like it a lot.  Foursquare is ok, I just didn't like the cell groups or the overall church service very much.  Pullman Baptist has a good mix of hymns and contemporary songs, which I like, and the pastor is really good.  The bible study is pretty cool too.  OH and of course soccer is starting soon!  I plan to be on a team with Isaac again, perhaps with Micah and Michael and *gasp* Andy T, who has returned to Pullman after a year on the lam.  

I should be reading! or homeworking! gaaaah"

"event","So these last nine weeks down in South Carolina have been pretty amazing.  I've gone to Charleston a few times, Washington DC, Atlanta (and saw Margina, a blast from the past!), camping and rock climbing in NC, Carowinds amusement park, and Florida (Melbourne and Tampa).  I've researched Gas Diffusion Layers for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells, which is probably about as interesting as it sounds.  I feel like I've made really good friends, some of whom I'm sure I'll keep in touch with for a long time.  I guess I'm pretty happy with the summer, overall.  Now I've only got one week left, and then once I'm home the family is going to Cannon Beach for a family reunion, during which I shall also finally reunite with my girlfriend!  Personally, I would think that the ""beach"" part of that trip will be less appealing now that  I have gotten used to the very warm southern Atlantic Ocean, but it should still be fun.

I also read the last Harry Potter book, I finished it the other day.  How crazy was that?  I figured some of the stuff that happened was bound to at some point, though I didn't expect it to be in this book.  I GUESS I shouldn't say much in case some people haven't read it yet, but if you have feel free to comment/talk to me about it.  

In other news, I have rediscovered my love for Futurama.  I bought the first season on DVD the other day, and have already watched all the episodes.  This is perhaps more a comment on the lack of work I've had to do the last few days, rather than a disparaging image of my laziness.  However, I did manage to stay up 'til 4AM last night, seeing as this was the first Saturday in weeks where I did not have some reason to wake up early.  At any rate, Futurama is OKAY, I mean SO GOOD!  Fry is definitely my hero, swish!  And Zoidberg reminds me of my friend Alex from England, which is a bit bittersweet as it's entirely possible I'll never see him again, but it was definitely good times seeing him scuttle (yes scuttle) down the hallways of Mary Williams Residence Hall yelling ""whoob whoob whoob wob wob"", as you do.  Ahh, the days of drinking shots of beer every single bloody time Bender appears on screen.  I guess I'll just have to start a tradition of this back at WSU when I finally go home.

Not to worry, oh Tri-Citians who have so desperately missed my enlightening presence, I shall be reunited with you in two weeks, before leaving for school two weeks later.  No, seriously, I think some serious basketball has to be played.  Or volleyball.  Or video games (I suppose, sigh).  Or something, I don't want to grow up!"

"event","So this Washington DC place is pretty cool.  A bunch of us REU students went up there last weekend, 9 of us actually.  Sort of a big group, but amazingly we were super-coordinated for the most part.  We left at around 2pm last Friday and drove the EIGHT HOURS or so that it took to get to our hotel.  We stayed at this slighty dodgy hotel in a slightly dodgier area in the outskirts of DC (like 1/4 mile from the Maryland border).  We had some difficulty finding the hotel initially, as we missed the exit.  We ended up in downtown DC (like the opposite end of Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House) and stopped at a gas station to ask for directions.  Sam and I got out of our car (we were in the 2nd of the two cars) and found Caitlin, from the first car, talking to this guy.  We assumed she was asking for directions, though later we found out she thought he was hitting on her.  Anyways, we asked him if he knew where our hotel was, and he said that he had just come from that area and would take us back, just to follow him.  At this point I should point out that this man looked at least 35, had super scrubby clothes on, was drinking something out of a paper bag, and, in fact, was mostly toothless.  We were at least slightly worried that he would either lead us into the hood where we would get mugged or the wrong way down a one way street.  I have to say that honestly I wasn't that worried, I was more concerned with his possible drunkenness, where he might intend to actually take us the right way but get confused and get us more lost.  However, we wrung our hands in vain, as he led us straight there - albeit through a backroads, very dodgy route.  When we got there, we got out to thank him, and he said ""you guys must have had a Christian in the car with you, Jesus led you straight to me, praise God!""  To which I sort of inwardly laughed, b/c I was defintely praying that we wouldn't get shot!  

We started exploring DC the next morning.  The hotel had free shuttle service to the nearest metro station, which was great.  For those who don't know, the metro system is basically a subway system, just with more waiting between trains.  Anyways, once we got to Union Station, we decided that we were close enough to walk to the Capital Building.  
We then more or less saw the sights, with nothing all that interesting happening.  We walked from there to see the Air and Space part of the Smithsonian, and then walked across the Mall towards the the National Archives, where they have not only the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, but also the Magna Carta.  That's right, we don't have enough history here in America, we must steal from other countries.  I'm really not sure what the story behind this is, but for whatever reason we <i>do</i> have it.   After waiting in line a couple minutes and not seeing it move at all, I wandered up to the front and asked someone how long they'd been waiting.  ""An hour and a half, but the line wasn't as far back as it is now"" was all I needed to hear, and we went straight off to the White House.  
We stopped along the way to eat lunch at ESPNZone, yes the restaurant version of ESPN.  It was AMAZING.  Televisions everywhere!  There must have been ten TVs in my vision (without turning my head) from where I sat at the table.  I figured that this was the perfect place for a coed group to eat.  The girls could talk while the guys could pretend to listen but really be watching TV.  Which definitely happened.  This naturally occurring phenomenon is made even less obvious when the guy doesn't even have to turn his head to be watching at least three different sports at any one time.  There were even little TVs at eye level in the wall above the urinals.  And a larger one above each of the stalls in the bathroom.  The food was about as pricy as could be expected, but they definitely gave you enough food to be full (or more than).

After lunch, we walked to the White House and took pictures of the ridiculously manicured lawn and the Hollywood view of the house (no tours while George is home, security reasons I imagine).  
We then walked as close as you could get to the Washington Monument before you got run over by bulldozers that were doing some sort of modification to the surrounding area.  We saw the WWII Memorial (so pretty) and then went to Lincoln Memorial.  

We then decided to go to Arlington National Cemetery, saw the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, as well as a number of other things.  We finished off the touring day with Iwo Jima Memorial, and then took the metro back to Union Station.  I've included a rough path of how far we walked below, with the whole path being somewhere between 8 and 10 miles.  

<img src=""C:\Documents and Settings\John.JOHN-LAPTOP\My Documents\My Pictures\DC Travles.jpg"">

After that, some of us drove over to Baltimore to watch an Orioles game.  The main reason for this was so that we could see the famous Camden Yards, which was in fact amazing.  The Orioles slaughtered the Rockies (surprise surprise) and we saw Sammy Sosa hit a double and Rafael Palmeiro drive him in with a first-pitch single.  We then walked around the harbor a bit and found a nice pub where we ate dinner.  We finally got home and went to bed around 1AM, having woken up for breakfast that morning at 8AM - basically a very long day.  

We drove back the next morning, with all the guys in one car and the girls in another.  Basically, the ride back for the guys was all about 50 Cent and other various Rap/Hip Hop/ R&B artists.  A picture says 1000 words, right? (thanks for the pic Krystal! even tho you technically didn't say I could... it's better to ask forgiveness than permission, right?)

If you can't really tell what's going on, we're all wearing shades and bumping, as it were.

Good times.

P.S. My picture page is always being updated, feel free to check it out!  Most of the DC pictures are up there, along with other cool stuff."

"event","So in reality I have a four day weekend going on right now.  On Friday, we had this ""Graduate Student Symposium"", where all of the ChemE grad students gave presentations to professors, industry people, and us (the REU students).  This took all day, so no actual work was done.  In addition to this, on Monday I will be traveling with my professor and grad student to the company that is funding our research.  I am pretty sure I'll only be watching them all talk, hopefully they won't ask me to say anything!  I mean, I feel confident about what I know, but that's not really that much.

We went to this awesome beach yesterday, where once again the water was WARM.  A bunch of us threw a football around while jumping waves and stuff, that was fun.  OH and about 8 of us decided we are going to drive to Washington DC next weekend.  It's around 7 hours to drive each way, but none of us have been there before and I think we mainly just want to see the sights.  We probably won't be able to really tour any museums, but if we see the various memorials and such I feel we'll be doing alright.

I think some serious tennis is in order shortly, so I'll sign out.  Now if only my skin didn't peel in the sun so badly..."

"event","Hello!

Well, thanks to the prodding of <lj user=""robandjodi"">, I have finally started an lj.  I suppose I should take this opportunity to tell anyone who's reading that I am currently in South Carolina doing fuel cell research.  It's not as good in the money department as PNNL would have been, but I feel that the addition of a different employer would be good for the ol' resume.  

So far, life has been grand.  I kind of get this feeling that every weekend here will be spent doing something exciting.  I mean, it's like heaven without homework after a full day of career-furthering, and so all the normal stay-at-home relaxation occurs each night (especially while the NBA playoffs are still going!).   Anyways, in the two weekends I have been here I have been to the beach once and to Charleston twice.  A bunch of us went to <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/fosu/"">Fort Sumter</a>, where the Civil War began, and I found out that I really never thought much about the war.  I mean, over the course of the year, Charleston was bombarded by Union artillery without consideration of the city's inhabitants.  I guess war is never pretty, and there are probably always atrocities of some nature on both sides.  At any rate, the layout of the fort in relation to the harbor was pretty interesting, and I felt I got a good grip on the war strategy that played out during the war.

The weekdays here are pretty good also.  It's only been deathly hot a few times, one of which was when we were outside playing beach volleyball at the gym.  Needless to say, my once white back got quite badly burnt, but has by now transitioned to pinkish tan.  We've got a weekly volleyball thing going every Tuesday, and basketball every Wednesday, and I'm sure more things will come as everyone becomes better friends.  Oh, by everyone, I mean the other students doing the same program as I am (hereafter referred to as the REU program, and thus REU students), all 24 of them.  I pretty much like everybody, which I hope/believe is mutual, and everyone gets on fairly well.  It definitely feels like Freshman year again, where a bunch of random people are thrown together in a dorm.  <i>I</i> like it, though others may not.

Well, the first game of the Finals is on so I'm off to watch it.  Anyone who has an lj account, please feel free to give me tips on cool things one can do with lj.  I shall conclude with a link to my photo page, where in theory I will compliment this journal with pictures from SC, as well as other stuff.  The site is http://photos.yahoo.com/johnnyots16.  Feel free to peruse (love that word) at your convenience!"

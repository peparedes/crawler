Update your bookmarks and come visit my new blog that I will (hopefully) update a bit more.

"event","I Hope Tomorrow is Like Today

I'm awake, you're still sleeping
The sun will rise like yesterday
Everything that we are now
Is everything we can't let go
Or it's gone forever, far away
I hope tomorrow is like today

Don't you go away tomorrow
I don't think I could handle that
You're probably dreaming that you're flying on
Then you start to fall
But then you rise
and shine forever
Don't go away
I hope tomorrow is like today"

"event","Hi.
I've had to go through and start making all of my entries friends only. My new school district strongly recommends it and I can't disagree. The last thing a teacher wants is her students learning about her personal life without her knowledge.
So, if you want to be put on my friends list, just ask. I'll definitely let you, just as long as you aren't a student of mine. :)"

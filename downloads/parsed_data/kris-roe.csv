Lately things have not been going so great. I suppose it doesn't help that I keep going back to old problems and digging them back up. I keep going back to old wounds and cutting them open, letting them bleed everywhere. I really want to stop, but I'm not doing so well. 

I stayed up all night a few days ago and just talked to Denice. Lots of yelling and tears, but more talking than anything. I told her if it wasn't for her being pregnant I would've left her by now. She certainly wasn't happy with me and started to yell. I don't know if she meant to or not but she almost flat out told me she found someone else. Which I had figured out by now. 

I realized that happiness doesn't always lie in the hands of a significant other. Friends, family, music...it all is something to fall back on when things go wrong. A lot of times I push the people away that just want to help and hate seeing me upset. 

Anyways this turned out as terrible as I expected. I am feeling particularly upset right now, maybe I can get some good songs out of it."

Right now I am in Ireland, getting ready for a show later. Aaron flew here with me because he's going through a rough time and I couldn't leave him at home alone. We hid under blanket and I played a song for him last night. It was interesting. We also sat and talked for a while and he brought up something that has been lingering in the back of my mind for quite some time. And when he said it, it made my suspicions increase because until that point I thought I was crazy for thinking it. Denice called earlier and said she wanted to come up and be with me for a while. I asked her if she was up for it, seeing as how she never wants to do anything at home. Oh well.

<i>I sat and thought the other day how it seems strange that we can walk through life so blind and how a lot of people never change.</i> I've been thinking about all sorts of things lately. Seeing as how my birthday is next week, my mind has been on my past and my future. In two years I'll be turning thirty. I honestly never thought I'd make it this far. But I'm glad I have, and I'm happy with where my life is going. And I'm happy with where it is right now. I've managed to maintain a steady marriage for over a year, I'm in a successful band, I've got good, strong friendships, and my wife has a baby on the way. It took me a long time to get where I am right now, and I really hope it stays this way. I do have reason to believe it won't, but I need to think positively. Or else things will go crashing down, like always. It's nice to have a fresh start with old friends. And to hear them say things that used to make you happy, and have them still make you happy. Well this post really didn't turn out any good so I'm going to quit rambling and go find some food."

I nearly fell over when I opened the door. Starla and Angie were standing the doorway with their arms full of presents. I grabbed the presents from Starla, set them aside, and picked her up and didn't put her down for a while. Then I invited them both in to join us. Needless to say Denice and Kid were rather surprised as well. I happened to have Starla's things in my room so I went and got them for her so we could all open our gifts up. She kept one of them next to her the whole time and I asked her who it was for. ""It's for Maggie, Daddy!"" After a long, akward silence, and quite the angry stare from Denice, I went in the kitchen and got drinks for everyone. When I came back Dee and Angie were talking and Kid was helping Starla with the Easy Bake Oven he got her. After a while Angie said she had to get going, but she would let Starla stay until after her birthday. I decided I'll take her out one day just to have a day to ourselves for our birthdays. I'm planning on having a party at my house. Everyone's invited so I hope to see everyone there<s>not that anyone will show up</s>. IM me if you have any questions.

"event","I really wonder at times what's going on in my head and what causes me to be so stupid at times. I nearly lost the best friendship I have ever had and probably will ever have. I did something so horribly cruel, and I would take it back so very fast if I could. Well, maybe I wouldn't take back the action, but I would prevent the pain. Seeing him so angry, so hurt, so disappointed was more guilt than I could handle. I grabbed my keys and said ""I'm outta here"" and as I was headed towards the door, he ran out yelling ""Fuck you"" as he went. I followed him out the door only to see the rear end of his car as his tires squealed and he soon disappeared down the street. I just calmly got into my car and headed toward the park. I told everyone I was headed for Indiana to see my mom. I only said that to make sure no one found me. I spent the day on a park bench crying until I literally couldn't anymore. I must've been quite a sight to see. Some time around 5pm, he called my cell phone begging me to come home and to keep him from driving his car off the end of the pier. I just said no and hung up. He of course called me back and said ""Don't hang up on me again."" I decided to hear him out and listen to what he had to say. ""Kris, I don't care about what you did anymore. I realize that you are far more important to me than some relationship in the past that doesn't even mean a thing to me now. I need my best friend. Please come home."" ""Kid, I already am home."" ""You're in California?"" ""No, Indiana. Home."" His hopes fell when I said that, and although he didn't make a sound, I could just tell. It was like I felt his heart sink when I said that, because mine did too. Eventually, he got so upset that he had a massive asthma attack and said ""Kris...come...come home n...now."" I knew at that very moment that he needed me and that I needed him, so I threw the fight aside and said I'd fly home. Of course I had to wait long enough to make it believeable that I had actually been in Indiana. I got there and found his room. The second he saw me, I saw in his eyes that everything really would be okay. Things were still rough after he got out. I was still upset and I didn't trust completely that he was my friend. That was such a horrible feeling. Something I <b>never</b> want to feel again. The next day, I walked up to him and said ""Kid"" and he said ""Yes?"" I walked up to him and gave him a huge hug and said ""I am so sorry and I promise I will never do that again. I am so lucky to be your best friend."" All the while I never let go. He told me the same thing and said he was sorry. I leaned over and whispered ""I got my best friend back."" He said he got his back. I told him that his best friend was the luckiest person ever, but also very stupid. ""Don't say things like that about him, he's a great guy and I love him."" was all he said to that. Hearing that was so wonderful. It melted away all the pain and guilt lingering and let me be happy. I have been in the greatest mood ever since. I am seriously so incredibly lucky that he even talks to me still. Kid, I am so happy we're still best friends and please don't ever let me be so dumb again. I wouldn't be able to take it. You are one of the best people I know, and I never want to lose you. See you tomorrow. Can't wait to give you your Christmas gifts. Love ya, man."

Going off of what Claire said about feeling left behind when better things come along, I'm feeling that way with nearly all my friends. Kid with Katie, Aaron with Aly. There are others, and one is my own fault for being an idiot. I'm lucky Denice didn't leave me when I had a lapse of intelligence and sanity. I love that she's always there. Everywhere I turn, she's there waiting for me. Waiting to comfort me. Waiting to console me. Waiting to share in my joys and triupmhs. I really am lucky and most times I fail to notice that. I'm lucky to have people that care. I'm lucky they stick around when I'm being my normal asshole self to them. I don't see the point. I would've been gone long ago if I were treated the way I treat them. I sit here wondering why someone doesn't just slap me in the face repeatedly. I mean, my friend starts crying and all I do is talk down to him. I tell him what to do, how to live his life. He's not 5, he's a grown man. Everytime I feel threatened, I put up my walls. Each time I put up one more than before, making it harder and harder for people to get in. I just want to quit feeling threatened and quit being a jerk. I get threatened for no reason. No reason at all. But my heart can't see that.

"event","Last time I got in a fight with Kid, I passed out and wound up in the hospital. Last night we were fighting again and he started coughing really bad. Then he said ""ew"" and I asked what was wrong. He said he tasted blood that time. I forgot everything that made me mad at that moment and dragged him outside and grabbed a cab. I told the driver to go as fast as possible to the hospital. So now I'm sitting in his hospital room while he sleeps. Katie is here too. They said he gets out tomorrow. Seeing as how we're in Florida for a show tonight and one tomorrow, I decided to fly Aaron out here to play for Kid so we don't have to stay any longer than we originally planned. Luckily Kid doesn't mind, because I flew aaron up here without asking first. Well, it's show time now. Goodnight all."

<b>My So Called Life</b>
Ever since I saw you
On my so-called life,
I've been writing you these letters 
Asking you to be my wife.
But its been almost a year
And still I've gotten no reply,
I'm assuming you have met some other guy.
So I sit in my room,
Watch Romeo & Juliet
A thousand times.
I wish I was as cool
As Leonardo is
But I'm not.

[Chorus]

I went on Jerry Springer
To confess my love to you
You said I didn't have a chance
And there was nothing I could do
You told me I was crazy
And wished that I was dead.
You threw a chair right upside my head

Today I highjacked a plane
I wrote your name across the sky,
Miss Clare Danes.
But they were waiting on the ground
To take me straight to jail

[Chorus]

Im staring at your pictures
From my lonely little cell
I'm writing you this letter
To let you know i doing well
Until we meet again
You know I'll cry a thousand tears
And I'll see you in another twenty years.
I'll see you in another twenty years.
I'll see you in another twenty years.</lj-cut>"

"event","So it turns out Kid wasn't really gone. He was in his bedroom the entire time. He slept half the time. And the other half? I don't know, but I was angry to find he didn't use some of his awake time to let me know he was not gone. I got really worried over nothing, and that frustrates me. I feel like I'm the only one doing my part in this friendship. And sadly, that's not the only one of my friendships that feels one-sided.

"event","Well, it seems my best friend is missing. No one has seen him or heard from him since he left his date with Katie early. This really can't be good. I've repeatedly tried to call his cell phone with no such luck. He never answers. Last time I talked to him he said he was doing fine, except for throwing up on his way to pick Katie up from the airport. He was a lot better than he has been in previous weeks. Which makes his sudden disappearance even stranger. If anyone sees him or talks to him, please tell him to call me. Kid, if you see this, call me or come home or something! I would like to know what the hell is going on!"

I had to put my list of things I'm thankful for.

<lj user=""d_hammericksen"">-Denice, I honestly don't know where I would be without you. I love you so much. More than anything. These next nine-or-so months are going to be tough, but so incredibly worth it. I am so sorry for ever hurting you, and I really don't know where my head was. I am very lucky you've given me the second and third chances you have. I am lucky to have you in my life, period. Thank you baby, I love you.

<lj user=""chris_kid_knapp"">-What can I say? You're my best friend in the entire world, and I am so grateful to have you around. I wonder why you stick with me the way you do. All the times you try to help and I turn around and bite your head off for it. Just confuses me whenever I think about it. I just hope you'll be around for a long time and maybe stop hiding things from me. Good luck with Katie, Kid. You deserve it.

<lj user=""j_collura"">-Hey dude, you're awesome. You always make me laugh because you're so crazy. I'm really glad you're in the band and that we're friends. I wish you and Kristen the best.

<lj user=""m_gyllenhaal"">-I know we've grown apart, and I only have myself to blame for that. We've been through so much, and I'm glad we're still friends...even if we're not all that close. That month and thirteen days was definitely a wild ride. But I loved every minute of it. You taught me so many things, and I will never forget what we had. Thank you for all you've given and shown to me, Tigger. 

<lj user=""aaronxescolopio"">-Aaron, Aaron, Aaron. You rock, dude. You sure know how to throw a good party. Hahaha. I wish you and your band the best of luck. You guys will go far. You're on of my best friends and I'm glad. Good luck with Aly.

<lj user=""donna_r_aly"">-ALY! You're so cool! You make Aaron so happy. Which is great. You are a really fun person to talk to. Good luck with Aaron. Oh, and have fun with your guitar ;)

<lj user=""katie_p"">-I just wanted to let you know how glad I am that you came into Kid's life. I knew when he told me about you, that you guys would be happy together. Let's just hope I'm right. Although I have no reason to think I'm not. Thank you for making him happy.

and last, but certainly not least:
I am ever so thankful for my lovely daughter Starla. I only wish I could see her more often.</lj-cut>"

Anyways, I haven't been online much in the past two days. I've been busy helping get ready for today. And hanging out with my best friend. He said he's found someone new. Which couldn't make me happier. I gave her ""the test"" and she passed with flying colors. I really hope she makes him happy if they end up together. I don't want to see him get hurt like he did ever again. But I'm not expecting him to this time. The good thing is, is that I don't have to worry about that."

The doctors still aren't positive as to what caused it. When I came to, Kid, along with some EMTs, was standing over me. Kid was sobbing and begging me to wake up and be okay. I grabbed his hand and asked what was going on. He told me what happened on the way to the hospital. I've been here ever since. Everyone is worrying about me, and I don't want them to. I'll be fine, I just passed out. Nothing more. I just want him to be okay. That's all that matters to me right now. I don't care one bit about myself right now. I feel fine and I just want to get home and make sure Kid is going to be okay. <small>Can I just grab him and leave right now?</small>"

"event","I'm at my house with Kid right now. We were in his hotel room talking and all of sudden his cell rang. His sister called to tell him that their dad had a massive heart attack. I could tell something was horribly wrong by the tone in his voice. ""Kris...my dad had a massive heart attack."" My heart sank right to the floor when he said that. He told me he was flying home right away, and I told him I had to go with him. I couldn't let him go anywhere alone in his condition. I was practically carrying him out to the car because he was such a mess. We kept stopping on the way to the car so he could calm himself a little. One time I just hugged him and didn't let go for a few minutes. But then he started digging through his pockets to find his sister's cell number. While I was holding his cell, his mom called, so I answered. She called to tell him that his dad passed away. He leaned against the car and told me something horrible. He told me that he was going to try to make things right with his dad and that he was going to apologize. They had been fighting because, while drunk, his dad gave Kid's condo away because ""the tenant was never home"". He told me it couldn't be real. He wouldn't believe it. As much as I didn't want to, I told him it was real, and he had to believe it. We finally got in the car and started down the road. About 5 minutes later, Kid told me to pull over. As soon as I got stopped, he got out and just started throwing up. After that, he sat on the ground and leaned against the side of the car crying. I got out and just sat next to him. I didn't know his dad, but I cried with him. Seeing him in such bad shape was heartwrenching. I couldn't bear to see him that way. From then on is pretty much a blur. I pulled the futon into his room so that if he needs anything during the night, he doesn't have to walk all the way to my room to get me. Well, I better get going. It's been a long day and I'm exhausted."

"event","Aaron and Aly's wedding was absolutely beautiful. They both looked great. Aaron looked so happy it was frightening. I hope someone got a picture of his face! Aly looked very pretty. Her dress was nice and it fit her personality. I don't know how a dress can fit someone's personality, but you get the point. After that we went to the reception. Lots of drinking. I don't know why I drank. I have a the flu right now and that was the worst thing I could've done. Kid and I got so drunk. Since Aly was sick we went to the hotel and partied there. That was fun. It was better because then we didn't have to go far to get to our rooms. When we were getting ready to leave, I gave Aaron and Aly the presents Dee, Kid and I got them. They loved them. We were happy. After that we all went to bed. I felt so horrible when I woke up this morning. I didn't look any better either. I haven't left the bathroom all day. I'm even laying on the floor typing this right now. I need to go to the doctor and make sure I'm not really super sick. I'm getting nauseated again so I'm going to lay back down."

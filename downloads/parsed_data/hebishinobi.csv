I am not sure what to make of this. The fact I find it arousing is even more disturbing. 

I don;t think I want to know what was going through this artist's mind at the time.

"event","It looks like I have a little bit of free time this evening. Why don't I take a few sketch requests?

I will be willing to take up to five requests. I'm sorry, but I just do not have the time to do any more than that.

And to my former teammates, I already know your opinion of my skills. Don't even bother commenting, it would just be a waste of your time and mine."

20 THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT GARBAGE

1.  Dawn of the dump: The oldest trash heaps, called middens, are in South Africa and contain shells roughly 140,000 years old.  Middens - which may also include bones, charcoal, feces, and pottery shards - provide much of what we know about ancient diet and lifestyle.
2.  In 500 B.C. Athens created the first municipal dump, requiring trash to be disposed of at least a mile from city walls.
3.  Today Americans generate 472 billion pounds of trash every year, including 96 billion pounds of food - more than 300 pounds per person.
4.  And that's only 2 percent of the total waste stream.  The rest is industrial refuse, including mine tailings, agricultural waste, construction debris, and exotics like ""pickle liquor,"" an acid solution used to clean steel.
5.  No, you're not less of a man if you let a garage do the work: One quart of motor oil, improperly disposed of, can pollute 250,000 gallons of drinking water.
6.  Each year, consumers in the United States spread 300 million pounds of chemical insecticides, including compounds that the EPA says may impair the nervous system, disrupt hormones in the body, or cause cancer.
7.  Yet people worry about MSG in Chinese food.
8.  Well, the words are confusing: A.J. Weberman writes in his memoir that Bob Dylan once chased him down the street and smashed his head on the pavement after catching the self-professed ""garbologist"" rummaging through his trash, seeking clues to his song lyrics.
9.  Weberman went on to found the National Institute of Garbology and claimed to have excavated telltale trash from Neil Simon (bagel scraps and ants), Gloria Vanderbilt (an empty prescription medication bottle), and Normal Mailer (betting slips).
10.  In 1986 a fan at a Steve Winwood concert flicked a cigarette lighter and exploded methane leaking from the landfill underneath Shoreline Amphitheatre.
11.  Landfills are actually the No. 1 human-generated source of methane, belching 7 million tons into the atmosphere each year.
12.  Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island in New York, which closed in 2001, is the world's largest city dump.  Covering about 2,200 acres, it is one of 1,767 landfills in the United States.
13.  Sure it was an accident: In 1996 there were three deaths at a transfer and recycling center in Brooklyn.
14.  Three years later, a severed human head showed up on the conveyor belt at the same facility.
15.  British inventor Peter Durand patented the tin can in 1870.
16.  A little late, buddy: Ezra Warner of Connecticut patented the first can opener in 1858.  Americans throw away about 50 billion aluminum cans each year.  If you dug up all the cans discarded in the past 30 years, they'd be worth nearly $20 billion.
17.  Americans receive roughly 100 billion pieces of junk mail each year.
18.  They don't have to: Call 888-5-OPTOUT to get your name removed from some junk mail lists.
19.  In 2002 marine researcher Charles Moore surveyed 500 square miles of the North Pacific and found 10 pounds of floating plastic for every pound of living plankton in the water.
20.  But we're not the only ones making a mess: Pack rats generate mounds made of sticks, plant fragments, dung, and rocks, cemented together with their own urine.  These rodent trash heaps can last up to 40,000 years.


Stand amazed.  Look around you... Look at all of the freaking garbage overflowing your surroundings.  I should check out that junk mail number to see if it actually works..."

"event","I didn't write these but I was cleaning out my mailbox and thought they were cute:

A monkey is sitting in a tree, smoking a joint, when a lizard walks past. The lizard looks up and says to the monkey ""Hey! what are you doing?"" 

The monkey says ""Smoking a joint, come up and join me, my cold-blooded friend."" 
So the lizard climbs up and sits next to the monkey and they have some joints.
After a while the lizard says his mouth is 'dry', and that he's going to get a drink from the river.
At the riverbank, the lizard is so stoned that he leans too far over and falls in. A Crocodile sees this and swims over to the stoned lizard, helping him to the side. He then asks the lizard, ""What's the matter with you?!""
The lizard explains to the crocodile that he was sitting in the tree, smoking a joint with his new monkey friend. He then explained how his mouth got dry, and that he was so wasted that, when he went to get a drink from the river, he fell in!
The inquisitive crocodile says he has to check this out. He walks into the jungle and finds the tree where the monkey is sitting, finishing a joint. 

He looks up and says ""Hey, MONKEY!""
The Monkey looks down and says ""FUUUUUCK, DUDE....... how much water did you drink?""


The Parrot
 A young man named John received a parrot as A gift. The parrot had a
 bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary. Every word out of the
 bird's mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity. John tried
and tried to change the bird's attitude by consistently saying only
 polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of to
 ""clean up"" the bird's vocabulary.

 Finally, John was fed up and he yelled at the parrot. The parrot
 Yelled back. John shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even
 ruder. John, in desperation, threw up his hand, grabbed the bird and put
 him in the freezer. For a few minutes the parrot squawked
 and kicked and screamed. Then suddenly there was total quiet.
 Not a peep was heard for over a minute.

 Fearing that he'd hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to
 The freezer. The parrot calmly stepped out onto John's outstretched arms
 and said ""I believe I may have offended you with my rude
 language and actions. I'm sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate
 transgressions
 and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and
 unforgivable behavior."" John was stunned at the change in the
 bird's attitude. As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a
 dramatic change in his behavior, the bird continued, ""May I ask
 what the turkey did?"""

"event","Here's an exerpt from a book that I am currently reading for my Asian American Studies R2B class.  It rang a few bells as I was reading it and seemed quite connected to my daily life.  It is from the book, ""Tropic of Orange"" by Karen Tei Yamashita, found on page 56-57 of the Coffee House Press 1997 version:


    ""Manzanar imagined himself a kind of recycler.  After all he, like other homeless in the city, was a recycler of the last rung.  The homeless were the insects and scavengers of society, feeding on leftovers, living in residue, collecting refuse, carting it this way and that for pennies.  In the same manner, who would use the residue of sounds in the city if Manzanar did not?  This was perhaps a simplistic interpretation of his work, as simplistic as, for example, the description of his utilizing the sounds of cars whooshing down freeways to imitate the sound of the ocean.  Poetic, but false.  Everything had its own sound.  Genius disguised, as always, with innocent simplicity.

    There are maps and there are maps and there are maps.  The uncanny thing was that he could see all of them at once, filter some, pick them out like transparent windows and place them even delicately and consecutively in a complex grid of pattern, spatial discernment, body politic.  Although one might have thought this capacity to see was different from a musical one, it was really on and the same.  For each of the maps was a layer of music, a clef, an instrument, a musical instruction, a change of measure, a coda.

    But what were these mapping layers?  For Manzanar they began with the very geology of the land, the artesian rivers running beneath the surface, connected and divergent, shifting and swelling.  There was the complex and normally silent web of faults - cracking like mud flats baking under a desert sun, like the crevices in aging hands and faces.  Yet, below the surface, there was the man-made grid of civil utilities: Southern California pipelines of natural gas; the unnatural waterways of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and the great dark tunnels of sewage; the cascades of poisonous effluents surging from rain-washed streets into the Santa Monica Bay; electric currents racing voltage into the open watts of millions of hungry energy-efficient appliances; telephone cables, cable TV, fiber optics, computer networks.

On the surface, the complexity of layers should drown an ordinary person, but ordinary persons never bother to notice, never bother to notice the prehistoric grid of land usage and property, the great overlays of transport - sidewalks, bicycle paths, raods, freeways, systems of transit both ground and air, a thousand natural and man-made divisions, variations both dynamic and stagnant, patterns and connections by every conceivable definition from the distribution of wealth to race, from patterns of climate to the curious blueprint of the skies.

    As far as Manzanar was concerned, it was all there.  A great theory of maps, musical maps, spread in visible and audible layers - each selected sometimes purposefully, sometimes at whim, to create the great mind of music.  To the outside observer, it was a lonely business; it would seem that he was at once orchestra and audience.  Or was he indeed?  Unknown to anyone, a man walking across the overpass at that very hour innocently hummed the recurrent melody of the adagio."""

I must read as the clock ticks.  My oh my, feel the stress accumulate and burst the braincells in your mind.  A crack, a fissure explodes, releasing a tear or two.  You do as they tell you to, never give up and keep getting back up when you fall.  It's even worse if they think you should not fall.  As you can obviously observe, I'm in a bit of a pickle, hell a damn pickle jar.  Just loads of work with such little time.  What happened to the chill time?  Stress, a pivotal emotion in the making.
What do you do when you got that restless feeling in the pit of your stomach?  Feel it boiling away until it bursts...  Do you sing a song in your head?  Recite a poem?  I choose to take a deep breath, close my eyes and focus on a world that doesn't exist anywhere but in my mind, right in front of me.  I can do nothing but describe it to others, and if they choose to believe me I shall relax and put my feet up on the couch.  If they choose not to, my utopia is but a tumbleweed blowing in the wind of anonymity.
Droplets, some bigger than others, never cease falling from the sky.  The freezing wind picks up pace and tatters against everything, creating the band of rain that consistently plays throughout the day and night.  The horizontal rain makes soaking completely unavoidable.  The ocean waves crash against the beach yet has an overtone of calmness.  The gutter next to my head pangs and clatters, hyming a rythm.  Scribble scrabble.  My mind is foggy with the shadows of incessant work lingering behind the joint passing around in front of me.  The lights dim."

'Intersex' Fish Found Off Calif. Coast Mon Nov 14,10:47 PM ET


LOS ANGELES - Scientists have discovered sexually altered fish off the Southern California coast, raising concerns that treated sewage discharged into the ocean contains chemicals that can affect an animal's reproductive system. 

So-called intersex animals are not new, but most previous instances were in freshwater. Environmentalists say this is among the first studies to document the effects in a marine environment.

Last year, federal scientists reported finding egg-growing male fish in Maryland's Potomac River. They think the abnormality may be caused by pollutants from sewage plants, feedlots and factories.

In the latest studies, presented at Monday's Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry in Baltimore, scientists caught 82 male English sole and hornyhead turbot off Los Angeles and Orange counties.

Of those, 11 possessed ovary tissue in their testes, said Doris Vidal of the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project, who led one of the studies.

Scientists do not yet know how such sexual defects affect the overall fish population.

Nearly a billion gallons of treated sewage are released into the Pacific Ocean every day through three underwater pipelines off Huntington Beach, Playa del Rey and Palos Verdes Peninsula.

Although the wastewater is filtered, it still contains contaminants that settle onto the ocean floor.

Two related studies found that two-thirds of male fish near the Orange County pipeline had egg-producing qualities. In a laboratory experiment, male fish exposed to sediment collected from the pipelines also developed egg-producing traits.

Steve Weisberg, who heads the water research project, said the results warrant further study to determine whether sexually altered fish are widespread in ocean waters.

"event","Here's an interesting quote that I came across during my reading for my ethnic studies class.  It's form a book called We Took the Streets Fighting for Latino Rights with the Young Lords, by Miguel ""Mickey"" Melendez.

""Perhaps this is just a fanciful thing on my part but, whatever the origins of piragua [slushy snow cone type of drink], the fact remains that it is a humble food, most likely created by the poor as a way of making the essential act of drinking water a special pleasure.  Flavored syrup adds a burst of color and taste, transforming bland water into a treat, like candy.  It may not seem like much, but in El Barrio, affordable little pleasures like these were few and far between, making the piragua man even more valued in my community.  Piragua became an essential thread in the cultural fabric.  It reminds me of the humble hamburger, a staple of American diet and a cultural symbol second only to apple pie.  Few people know that the hamburger was created by poor immigrants traveling to the United States on Hamburg Line steamships.  The meat they were given on the journey was so bad that the only way the unfortunate passengers could swallow it was by grinding it down and sandwiching it between two halves of bread.  This habit endured among the poor for decades, as part of their voyage to freedom.  It wasn't until the twentieth century that the 'hamburger' made its official debut at the St. Louis World Fair, and people lined up willingly to pay for it.""

The history of the hamburger is rather interesting..."

What we love, 
What we devote our ardor to, or seek
In passionate earnest; even what we do
In our most commonplace and daily round,
Makes all the difference, and this applies
Not only to men, but to all animals.
Some day, in fact, you'll see a thoroughbred,
Asleep in a stall, break out in a sudden sweat,
His breath come faster and faster and his sides
Heave as he seems to pass the winning post
Or break as the starting-gate flies open.  Hounds
Twitch in their sleep, or try their best to run,
Give tongue, and sniff the air, as if caught
Scent of their quarry.  If you wake them up,
They'll chase the phantom of the stag they view
Bounding away from them, until at last
They come to learn the error of their ways, 
Returning gloomy to their wiser selves
Chopfallen in their disillusionment."

I smoke a cigarette, lost in the maze of my mind.  The toxic smoke enters my body and soaks into my lungs like a dirty sponge.  Subconsciously I gaze at the cloud of smoke emitted from my semi-moist mouth, like a contrail marking up the light blue sky, leading to the high speed jet from which it was born.  The smoke gathers, constantly changing directions and shapes, until it disappears, swallowed by the atmospheric melting pot.  I watch fervently.  The sun sets, the sun rises, light to dark, dark to light; they're all a correlative pair of twins running amuck in the back of my mind.  Every now and then time registers, signaling the minutes and hours that have passed with ease.  The clock becomes like a whisper in a crowded room, a splinter in the playground of life, minimal yet important.  I wander and daze in an apathetic haze.  The thing about sleep deprivation is that you're never really awake, you're stuck in a lethargic coma owned by a zombie nation.  You feel like you're outside looking in on the world as a spectator to the daily soap operas of real life.  I sit in my own little box looking out with 2 glimmering eyes, glossy and slightly pink, showing the blood pumping in their dark saggy portholes encased in my blank face.  I am mute externally but pondering nonetheless and feeding the necessary vocabulary to encourage the observable conversing and interactions to continue.  Is all of this really happening?  Is this what life is supposed to feel like?  Just a blur of moments interconnected like a web made by a caffeinated spider.  Shit are we in for a ride.

Bongos are beginning to play in the background as the bongs are bubbling away sanity.  Are you naked?  No, it's just this new jumpsuit I got that's nude color.  Nude color.  Copyright it now and send it to the shelves.  THE TURTLE IS TOO BIG, he's going to eat me.  Feel as your feet and hands grow with numbness, spreading like a disease throughout your body all the way to your eyelids.  Time to sit and ponder life.
Why aren't there any movies out there involving the fear of cockroaches?  We have spiders, anacondas, pirhanas, crocodiles, sharks, bears, lions, et cetera, yet where are the fucking cockroaches?  There should be huge cockroaches, roaming the planet during nuclear winter.  And then they'll eat all of the people alive!  Call the doctor, somebody stop me."

- from the novel ""Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress"" by Susan Jane Gilman

What about those waiting in line for coffee or espresso ice cream?  Are they the treat-wanters or the addicts?  Or a mixture of both?"

"event","Flash!  The sky lights up with celebration
Adding to our masses of abrasions
Sinking deeper into our tumultuous demise
We wait for the new times and the sunrise
The bangs speak of the needs
We feel inside thumping through our very veins
Flabbergasted, we take heed
We feel it switching lanes
In my head it creeps
Not making a sound
Not even squeek, beep or peep
I must release my hound
My right hand twinges with delight
As my eyes take in the star filled night
I dust the little pebbles off my feet
And think back to the days of innocence
When I was blind to the greed and deceit
And was teeming with ambivalence
My heart fills with nostalgia and haunting calamities
The communities are forced to face the actualities
Smile it's me
Look at what I've come to be
And whether you like it or not
I was always taught
To try to walk with my head held high
To deny the hate and ultimately defy
the ""wiseguy""
Why oh why am I so shy?
I guess this is my goodbye
Until the next time I decide to rhyme
Go climb a tree and eat a lime
Just watch out for the slime and grime
Cheers to the good times"

"event","Emotions are tricky.  Are they just chemical reactions in our brains and bodies, or perhaps something more?  Sometimes they cummulate into a Rubix cube in the pit of your stomach and send your nervous system into haywire.  The complicated multicolored and multisymboled cube pulsates, making your heartbeat audible in your inner ears.  Nausea overpowers your mind and the box grows.  On the verge of explosion, you'd do anything to pull the trigger on each memory that sparks about.  A firecracker sparks as time ticks away like a ticking time bomb.  The only savior to rescue your sanity is TIME.
The ticking clock standing erect over your head smiles wryly.  You follow your instincts as your first inclination leads to you grabbing the crowbar next to your right foot.  The glass and metal errupt into the final culmination.  As the pieces of the clock fly by, you hold your head up high, superceding the misconceptions and lies floating in a dark cloud in the sky.  The cool breeze is refreshing and you breathe in, filling your lungs with brimming rejuvenation.  The nausea in the depths of your intestines dissipates and a rainbow sprouts from the surrounding mountains.  The sun puts its dark aviator shades on and sips a berry margarita.  You drop to the ground with the exulting force known to humans as gravity.  As the love for life returns you recede into the world of dreams.  You close your eyes with utter exhaustion.  You will return tomorrow with a cunning grin on your face knowing you survived another day, another life.  The pieces glue together as you become one.  Start the projector and dim the lights as the Rubix begins to unfold."

"event","The following is an exerpt from Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides:

Emotions, in my experience, aren't covered by single words.  I don't believe in ""sadness,"" ""joy,"" or ""regret.""  Maybe the best proof that the language is partriarchal is that it oversimplifies feeling.  I'd like to have at my disposal complicated hybrid emotions, Germanic traincar constructions like, say, ""the happiness that attends disaster.""  Or: ""the disappointment of sleeping with one's fantasy.""  I'd like to show how ""intimations of mortality brought on by aging family members"" connects with ""the hatred of mirrors that begins in middle age.""  I'd like to have a word for ""the sadness inspired by failing restaurants"" as well as for ""the excitement of getting a room with a minibar.""  I've never had the right words to describe my life, and now that I've entered my story, I need them more than ever.  I can't just sit back and watch from a distance anymore.  From here on in, everything I""ll tell you is by the subjective experience of being part of events.  Here's where my story splits, divides, undergoes meiosis.  Already the world feels heavier, now I""m a part of it.  I'm talking about bandages and sopped cotton, the smell of mildew in movie theaters, and of all the lousy cats and their stinking litter boxes, of rain on city streets when the dust comes up and the old Italian men take their folding chairs inside.  Up until now it hasn't been my world.  Not my America.  But here we are, at last."

"event","Would you rather have your house be shaped like an igloo or a pyramid?
The brightness blinds you and you reach for the shade.  You release the tension of the pony tail and knock the horseshoe through the loop.  Lasso the tassle.  Morning is going to be bright.  It is there to greet you, disturb your focus.  A blur becomes your life.  You feel with numbing technicalities and smile at the opportunity of eating the chef's delight.  Simon says raise your right arm.  Simon says shake your head left and then right.  Simon says YOU SUCK, but who ever gave a damn for what Simon thinks or says anyway?
The lingering leftover hair wanders just enough to tickle your arm.  Oh but wait!  Those aren't hairs.  They are long legs, with life.  You flick the legs and core off of your arm into your cousin's grandmother's step child's 16 year old girlfriend's soup.  The mourning dove calls attention to the morning while she takes a drink of her glass of water with food colored ice.  Polly want a popsicle?  No, Polly doesn't even want a cracker.

Your Telltale Fingertips
How Hands Are a Marker for Behavior

Look down at your right hand.  Is your ring finger longer than your index finger?  Or vice versa?  To be certain, take a ruler and measure from the bottom crease of each finger to the tip.
The measurements tell you something about the environment of your mother's womb just weeks after your conception, a time when your fingers, and more importantly, your brain, were developing.  Because of the influx of sex hormones at the prenatal stage, men tend to have ring fingers that are slightly longer than their index fingers.  In women, these fingers are usually the same length or the index digit is just a bit longer.
Digits are subtly affected by testosterone and estrogen produced in the womb by the fetus (not by the mother).  Between weeks 8 and 14, tiny fetal testes, ovaries and adrenal glands secrete the baby's own supply of sex hormones.  These chemical messengers, particularly testosterone, cause chain reactions in the body, spurring the growth of the genitals, encouraging and inhibiting growth in brain regions and causing changes in the fingers.  Many scientists believe relative finger length - or digit ratio - is a marker for brain differences molded by hormones.  Like a bit of prenatal graffiti, a longer ring finger says, ""Testosterone was here.""
~The Digital Divide~
The difference is subtle, to be sure.  But scientists say the relative length of the index and ring fingers is a marker for major behavioral differences.  Finger length is a sexually dimorphic trait - that is, women tend to have one pattern and men another.  Scientists believe finger length is determined in the womb by the amount of testosterone a fetus generates.
To measure your fingers, use a ruler, starting at the bottom crease of the finger and ending at the tip.  (Index fingers usually have one crease, whereas the ring finger may have several.)  A photocopied hand is easy to measure.
-The Male Hand-
The Norm: Ring finger is slightly longer than the index finger.
Scientists say men who have the longest ring fingers have been exposed to high levels of testosterone in the womb.  Such a hypermasculine pattern is linked to aggression, attention deficit order, greater aptitude in sports and music, and in some studies, homosexuality.
-The Female Hand-
The Norm: Ring and index fingers that are about the same length or an index finger that is slightly longer.  
In women, longer ring fingers indicate exposure to high levels of testosterone during fetal development.  Longer than average ring fingers have been associated with assertive and aggressive behavior and homosexuality.
Longer than average index fingers are linked to high levels of fetal estrogen.  This pattern is associated with high fertility and a higher than average risk of breast cancer.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Where do these scientists come from that study the length of your fingers?  And it seems rather general to make such a specific statement.  Let me measure my hand...  Both are 2.6in.  I guess that's normal.  I'm right in between testosterone and estrogen levels.  For some reason my life likes being in between.
Look an add for Lyc-O-Mato.  How are you getting your daily dose of tomato power?  The power of five tomatoes in one little pill.  I knew it!  Our vegetables are going to be in pill form and we won't have to eat them anymore cause we will just take a freaking pill supplement!  AHHHHHHHH!!!"

A new type of exhaustion enraptures your body and your mind does all it can, with all of its might, to stay awake.  Slipping off into the dream world, you keep waking up with jolts from the surrounding waves.  You look up and see a group of drunk middle aged men, fishing.  The world rocks back and forth, side to side, with twists here and there.  The box, the booty of all treasures, calls out.  You pass by a Chilis and dream of taking it to your city, just for their chocolate molten cake.  Your saliva breaks down the ooey gooey yumminess.  The chocolate cake with a chocolatey syrup inside that bursts like a volcano with each forkfull.  To top it off, there's the ice cream that is covered in a hard chocolate shell.  Oh yes, can't forget the caramel on the sides and such.  Mouth waters...  You have turned into a pee machine, to the point where you're having a pee party every 15 minutes or so.  Pass that bowl in this direction.  Broken glass on the people filled porch.  There goes the strawberry margarita, made with real strawberries!  Party foul.  Hugs all around, I love yous are spread around town.  There's loud music blaring and a shot or two is taken.  The mind spirals down the rabbit hole.  Watch as I sit back and enjoy the ride.  I embrace all of the love that surrounds me, the peace taking over the atmosphere...  I love you all.  Thanks for the good times."

"event","Here's an interesting quote from the book Midsex by Jeffrey Eugenides:

...As I sit here in my Aeron chair, thinking E.O. Wilson thoughts.  Was it love or reproduction?  Chance or destiny?  Crime or nature at work?  Maybe the gene contained an override, ensuring its expression, which would explain Desdemona's tears and Lefty's taste in prostitutes; not fondness, not emotional sympathy; only the need for this new thing to enter the world and hence the heart's rigged game.  But I can't explain it any more than Desdemona or Lefty could have, any more than each one of us, falling in love, can separate the hormonal from what feels divine, and maybe I cling to the God business out of some altruism hard-wired to preserve the species; I can't say.  I try to go back in my mind to a time before genetics, before everyone was in the habit of saying about everything, ""It's in the genes.""  A time before our present freedom, and so much freer!  Desdemona had no idea what was happening.  She didn't envision her insides as a vast computer code, all 1's and 0's, an infinity of sequences, any one of which might contain a bug.  Now we know we carry this map of ourselves around.  Even as we stand on the street corner, it dictates our destiny.  It brings onto our faces the same wrinkles and age spots our parents had.  It makes us sniff in idiosyncratic,recognizable family ways.  Genes embedded so deep they control our eye muscles, so that two sisters have the same way of blinking, and boy twins dribble in unision.  I feel myself sometimes, in anxious moods, playing with the cartilage of my nose exactly as my brother does.  Our throats and voice boxes, formed from the same instructions, press air out in similar tones and decibels.  And this can be extrapolated backward in time, so that when I speak, Desdemona [grandmother] speaks, too.  She's writing these words now.  Desdemona, who had no idea of the army inside her, carrying out its million orders, or of the one soldier who disobeyed, going AWOL."

One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about humans was their habit of continually stating and repeating the very very obvious, as in ""It's a nice day,"" or ""You're very tall,"" or ""Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty-foot well, are you all right?""  At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange behavior.  If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up.  After a few months' consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favor of a new one.  If they don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working.  After a while he abandoned this one as well as being obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human beings after all, but he always remained desperately worried about the terrible number of things they didn't know about."

Woodpecker doesn't like what he sees when he sees himself
Sullivan, NY - Car owners around town are covering their mirrors in an attempt to outsmart a woodpecker who apparently thinks his reflection is an enemy.
Tim Taylor, who owns Thruway Auto Glass, said he had replaced 30 smashed mirrors last year and 18 this year because of the bird, which has claimed his area east of Syracuse as his territory.
""People come in pretty mad,"" Taylor said.  ""One guy's been in here three times already because he keeps forgetting to cover up the mirrors.""
During breeding season, males aggressively defend their turf, even against imaginary foes, said bird-watcher Benjamin Burtt.
Anne Miller has had two mirrors on her Pontiac Grand Prix smashed and watched the bird attack her neighbor's Malibu.
""I told him to shoo.  He did.  Then he came right back and finished the job,"" she said.  ""Instead of flying off, he walked across the windshield and did the passenger mirror.  I was flabbergasted.""

Far out in the unchartered backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.  Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all make a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place.  And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.
And then, on Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place.  This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.
Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terrible, stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost for ever."

"event","I find that the middle of the night is the most peaceful time to get to know your town.  Everyone is asleep, the streets are empty and quiet.  You look up and see some stars but not nearly enough as one could if there wasn't so much pollution.  The city lights look like runways as you get ready to take flight on your own adventure.  It gets dark in spots and you try to embrace them with no fear, but like an oil spill, the darkness overtakes you and you become one with the bushes.  You blink with hesitation until you walk into light again, where it becomes too bright since your eyes have adjusted to the shadows.  You look inside an electron window into another world, one that looks like New York, with a man and woman sitting in back of a cab.  The lady pops two pills.  The guy takes in a whole handful.  He scarfes them down and starts chewing.  After flipping to the cab driver and his expressions in the irritable traffic, I cast my eyes on him.  He is frozen, blue and with hanging icicles from his hair.  After exchanges of screaming between the driver and the woman, he slams on the brakes of the cab.  The frozen man's head flies off, as if he had just gotten beheaded in some Asian or American movie.  Clean cut.  They weren't pills!  They were new Dentyne Frost Bites GUM.  Fucking gum.  But I gotta admit, I love gum a hell of a lot more than I love pills.

You walk along and feel insignificant, but atleast you don't feel lonely.  The sound of the BART train echoes off of the cliffs, making a familiar loud whisper.  You feel that everyone's day is about to start when it's toward the end of yours.  The sky becomes slightly lighter, more blue than navy.  The birds have been chirping, and you try to decipher what they could possible be saying, if they are indeed saying anything at all.  The trees rustle in the cool sea breeze and you feel refreshened somehow even though you have been up for more than 20 hours.  The air seems fresher and crisper, more than any 7up or Barq's Rootbeer that you will ever taste.  Your tired beaten eyes jolt wider to suck in all of the oxygen atoms getting ready to attach and go through the maze of systems in our body.  The lawns are slightly gray, splattered with millions of water beads, adding the appearance of a wild animal to a mere blade of grass.  Rawr."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Evil Dentist

I sit down in the hard rigid dentist chair.  ""Please sit down here, and lay back.  The dentist will be here any moment now.""  I close my eyes and see them strapping me down as I kick and scream with fright.  I take deep breaths and sigh.  I feel my heart skip countless beats and I feel my stomach and intestines turn upside down, leaving my digestive system in a complete ruin.  I think back to all of the horror movies I've seen about dentists and all the stories about what they do when you're not looking or paying attention; behind the scenes.  The dental hygienist straps a muzzle on me, revealing or exporting gas.  I start to slip away...

I suddenly appear on a dark road.  I'm not sure if it's even a road.  I look down and see nothing but darkness and haunting shadows.  I start walking little steps, scanning my surroundings, searching for something familiar.  I look up to search for a sky of some sort but come up blank.  Just then I look down and see a cliff under my feet.  I stop myself as quickly as possible, and find myself grasping for balance.  I jump back a step, and am safe again.  I sigh and pant in relief and shock.  I almost lost my life by falling off a cliff that appeared out of nowhere, how was I going to explain that one to anyone?

Whiff!  The cliff and everything is gone.  I appear to be on a rainbow path.  Each tile or stepping-stone is filled with a bright color of the rainbow.  Beyond the path is nothing, complete blackness.  I start to walk slowly and cautiously, not knowing where to go, what direction to take, where the path leads.

Whiff!  I can't see anything now, as if someone put a blind fold over my eyes for a funny prank.  I shriek in terror, wondering how I would ever survive in this strange world without being able to see anyhting.  I start to crouch down to the ground, or at least I thought was the ground.  I feel something sticky and large.  I feel that I can't move my hand.  ""Great!  Now I'm blind without being able to move my hand!""  All of a sudden a bright shiny light flashes and I can see everything more clearly than I ever could except for the fact that the flashes make me feel as if I'm constantly sneezing.  As I look down I see my hand stuck in a giant spider web!  I try to move my hand vigorously, it won't move.  I cast my eyes on a huge spider, the size of a skyscraper, heading in my direction, hungry for its next meal.  My feet felt as if they were glued down to the floor.  I try harder and harder; they stay in the same exact spot.  Then I feel a hard shove against my left side.  I glance and see that it's some creature that looks somewhat like a deer.  I feel motion in my legs.  ""I can move!"" I exclaim.  I start to run as fast as I could.  I had no idea where I was going or what I was doing.  I just keep running until I couldn't feel my legs anymore.

Thud-thump.  Thud-thump.  Thud-thump.  It sounded like a very large elephant.  The bright rainbow path suddenly reforms.  I started to feel it vibrate with each thud-thump.  All of a sudden the brightly contrasted tiles change to dark muggy ones.  I sense danger.  I start to run as fast as I can.  I run for what seems to be five miles and then stop to catch my breath.  I hear the thud-thump grow louder and the vibrations rise higher, still behind me but gaining.  I start to hear it and feel it, coming from in front of me also.  Could there be two of whatever was making the loud noise and vibrating shudders?  What should I do next as the pounding gets faster and faster, louder and louder?  Unexpectedly all of the pounding stops.  I pause in fright and wonder.

I watch as the dark rainbow tiles morph into a dirt path, giving me the impression that I was on the cliff that I almost lost my life on before.  A loud shrieking roar wakens me from my stuttered state.  I widen my eyes as I cast my eyes on a Tyrannosaurus Rex in the distance, hunting down its prey - me.  The snarling ruthless creature spread out his hind legs and claws, read to pounce.  His teeth glared, his eyes were sharp and viciously mean.  His roar so horrifying and loud, the village people could hear it 50,000 miles away, I'm sure of it.  He begins to run towards me, and he seems to be greatly mad, for some odd reason.  I glance down at my legs, praying that they'll move.  Once again, they're stuck to the floor.  I look back at the T-Rex, running in my direction.  I stare in fright, hypnotized by my situation, frozen in time.

Just then, the roaring Tyrannosaurus Rex changes into a Triceratops continuing his run toward me, with his teeth bared ready to chomp on my tender flesh.  A strange sensation overcomes my ill-fated body.  I realize that I'm morphing, but into what?  I become aware of being surrounded by green.  Oh my God!  I've turned into something green and am still morphing.  I start to develop leaves of some sort.  Oh my God!  I'm a bush of lettuce leaves.  I feel my feet press into a hard surface.  I can't see my hands or feet but I sure can feel them.  I come out of my frozen trance, and my feet begin to run.  I ran as fast as I could, not knowing where I was going or what I was going to do once I got there.  All I knew was that I needed to get away from that plant-eating dinosaur!

All of a sudden my feet are in the air and I seem to be falling fast.  I look up and see the cliff above me.  ""AHHHHHHHHHHH!"" I scream in terror.  The next thing I know I'm falling into a tree and I have morphed into an autumn leaf.  I gently float on an autumn breeze and land on top of a pile of playing cards that seem to be all Spades.  I feel a jerky motion, I start to shiver and twitch.  I realize that I'm morphing back to my human form.  My eyes grow wide with astonishment as they cast on my normal body shape, as it appears.  I start to stand up.  I feel my legs start to stink and before I can do anything, before I know it, I fall through the pile of cards.

I wind up in a dark black leather chair.  ""I'm glad you could make it,"" I hear a dark deep voice.  ""Are you ready to die now, Kara?""  AHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.........  ""Kara?  Are you ready to get up now?"" the dentist asks.  ""Huh, what?"" I mutter in confusion.  ""You're all done.  Your cavity has been filled.""
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everytime I go to the dentist, I think of that rainbow path...


Well ain't that just spank you in the crotch fantastic?!"

"event","My mind runs amuck with thoughts pertaining to a random world which I have mysteriously named Krust, yes with a K.  In this world of K, the skies change colors according to the mood of all of its inhabitants.  The ground shakes with a bass beat that is constantly playing, except for the one hour period each 12 hours in which it takes a break from the shakes.  Does this land have water?  It's a rarity.  The ocean is filled with a substance that resembles marshmellows, melted marshmellows.  The average temperature of this pure white thick slushy is about 1,150 degrees fahrenheit, so the pillow of seas would not be very appealing to humans, unless you like that sort of hot waxy burning flesh feeling.  Does K have forests?  Why yes, the sphere is filled mostly filled with one of the most useful plants - hemp.  Hemp is used to make paper, clothing, jewelry, etc. for the intelligent, non-human inhabitants of Krust.  It had a moon, much like ours, at one point.  That is until one of the neighboring planet started a war with the Zooeekies whom inhabit one of the close stars.  The Zooeekies sent a solar bomb offtarget and the moon of Krust, Shine, exploded into billions of pieces.  Some of them fell to the surface of Krust, but most remained in the sky, like crumbs, following the usual orbit of Shine.

So what about these nonhuman inhabitants?  They have 3 arms and 4 legs.  They have no noses but sense smell through their feet.  They have 7 eyes throughout their body, their place depending on the individual.  Their brains take up most of their heads, which seem like a beach ball stuck on a tripod.  Their skin feels like a mixture between metal and KY jelly.  Its cool yet slippery sensation would send chills down anyones back.  They, like the sky, change into many different colors, depending on their mood.  You can read one like a mood ring, and decide how you would approach one.  They range in height between 2' at birth to about 20'.  They don't eat much since most of their energy is created using photosynthesis.  They thrive on glucose which is found in the candy that grows on certain types of hemp plants.  But of course there's more than one species that lives on Krust.  But what I have just described, the Schlong species, are the most dominant and widespread, mucyh like how humans are on this planet.  

The atmosphere mostly contains Xenon and Berkelium.  It's rather hot and humid, with a few solar breezes.  The constant quakes produce more glucose in the air and vibrate throughout the air.  With each beat you can feel the wave of energy pass through you and exit into the air, only to be sucked back up moments later.  The white seas are only slightly effected by the orbit of the remnants of Shine, due to the thick viscocity of the foamy lather.

Would you rather be a penguin or a seal in the bright white campfire of mellow pillow?  Welcome to the world of Krust.  Craving some pie?  Some marshmellow pie..."

Do you believe in fate?  You may to a certain extent, but to which is that?  Do you believe you have no control over your actions, or perhaps do you believe that life will play out as it should through your choices and consequences?  Or perhaps you just don't believe in fate and think that you have complete and total control over what happens and what could potentially happen...    I guess I believe in the second, the median between the two extremes.  Reminds you of sexuality, eh?"

""Jane Fonda Film Banned From Ky. Theaters"" 

ELIZABETHTOWN, Ky. - The owner of two Kentucky theaters has refused to show the new     Jane Fonda film ""Monster-in-Law"" because of the activist role the actress took during the Vietnam War. 

Ike Boutwell, who trained pilots during the Vietnam War, displayed pictures of Fonda clapping with a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft crew in 1972 outside the Elizabethtown Movie Palace to show his disapproval. The marquee outside Showtime Cinemas in nearby Radcliff reads: ""No Jane Fonda movie in this theater.""

Both theaters are just a few miles from the Army post of Fort Knox, south of Louisville.

""I think when people do something, they need to be held responsible for their actions,"" Boutwell said. ""When you give the enemy aid, it makes the war last longer.""

Fonda has apologized for being photographed on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun, but not for opposing the war.

Sal Mancuso, an Elizabethtown resident, said he personally thanked Boutwell for not showing the film.

""I think Vietnam veterans appreciate this,"" said Mancuso, who fought in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam war. ""There is no defense for what she did.""

Boutwell also banned previous Jane Fonda films, as well as Michael Moore's film, ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""

"event","Here's an article from the April 2005 issue of Discovery Magazine.  Article's title is ""Dinosaurs: Why do we hae so many questions about the most successful animals that ever lived?""  By Carl Zimmer
__________________________________________________________
How did those long-necked plant eaters get so big?

Some vertebrates, such as birds and mammals, grow fast when they're young and then stop growing altogether when they reach adult size.  Alligators and many other reptiles don't have such a big initial spurt.  Instead, they grow slowly for their entire lives.  These different growth patterns leave marks on bones.  Fast-growing animals expand their bones continually when they're young, and some of their old tissue gets destroyed as new bone forms.  By contrast, the bones of many slow-growing animals look like tree rings because animals grow in short bursts.

These microscropic clues survive in fossils.  For example, researchers have studied the bones from an 80-million-year-old crocodile called Deinosuchus that could grow to 50 feet long.  They concluded that it reached its huge size the way crocodiles do today, growing for 50 years or more.

Dinosaurs were different.  ""They did not grow like typical reptiles,"" says Kevin Padian, a paleontologist at the University of California at Berkeley.  Tyrannosaurus rex, for example, took only 20 years to reach full size.  But the biggest dinosaurs were off the charts.  Apatosaurus (also called Brontosaurus), one of the long-necked plant eaters known as sauropods, needed only 15 years to reach 25 tons.  ""They're just growing faster than any thing on land today,"" says Padian.

THe physiology behind this feat remains a mystery.  Equally puzzling is the fact that dinosaurs managed to reach such big sizes, while the land animals that came before and after them never came close.  Some researchers have proposed an environmental explanation:  Perhaps levels of carbon dioxide were unusually high, producing lush vegetation that could fuel the dinosaur boom.  But for now that is just speculation.  ""We don't have a good answer why dinosaurs were such big animals,"" says Hans-Dieter Sues.
_________________________________________________________

Dinosaurs amaze me.  If they were alive still we definitely would be non-existent.  That'd be great if they just popped up out of nowhere, but then we would fire nukes and kill EVERYONE.  Gotta love this world... We are still learning so much about our own planet.  Did anyone hear on the news the other day that scientists they witnessed a black hole forming, but since it's like 2.2 billion lightyears away, it happened 2.2 billion years ago.  And we witnessed it a few days ago!  Watch out now.  It shows you how big the universe it.  Our entire planet, or our entire galaxy, is not even an electron in the almighty expanse.  Now doesn't that make you feel significant?"

The television is a mere background noise, populating the empty space with unnecessary sound waves full of jabber about eating bugs.  Your mind starts jibbering and jabbering about littering on freeways.  You find yourself staring at the blank wall, only to find the wall covered with checkered paintings and twists and twirls that enter your cerebrex and flow down to the bottom of your spine.  Your back starts shaking until you twist it this way and twist it that, and it cracks.  The wet weather isn't over yet, so you take your red umbrella and exit the room.  Once you find yourself standing in the middle of another room, this one with bright white and gray clouds in a sky blue horizon.  You open up your umbrella and try to exit, but the umbrella gets caught on the doorknob.  It springs you back inside and the door shuts with such rabid force, you'd think a stampede of hurricanes were blowing about outside 500 yards in the distance.  The doorbell rings."

I'm getting ready for the revolution.  My life will come full circle and knock me straight to my forehead.  Feel as the blood rushes and tries to cling to your bones as it spins around in a hurricane of viscous red.
""The human body has numerous rhythms; sleep is one of them.  Even without sunlight, as in a cave, the body will still maintain a 24-hour awake/asleep cycle.  The heart rate falls to a very low ebb in the early hours of the morning, when you are usually asleep.  Body temperature, which affects mental processes, also drops during this time.  Consequently, if an air traveler is transported rapidly to a time zone five or six hours ahead of that of the departure point, even though it may be 8:00 or 9:00am at the arrival point local time, the traveler's body functions are at a low ebb.  As a result, the traveler feels subpar, and this feeling can persist for as long as two or three days unless something is done to correct it."" - ""Europe by Eurail"" by LaVerne Ferguson-Kosinski

Think of all of the people in this world and I won't even get to know .01% of all of them, at least ones that I'll be able to remember their names.  So you chill out, sit back and watch as traffic moves about 5 mph, and then stops for about 30 seconds.  You turn up the radio, lean back in your chair, roll down the sunroof and put on your sunglasses.  You feel the slight breeze and look back only to see a jumping kangaroo right on your tail.  You blink and the door shuts, the kangaroo disappeared.  What the fuck..."

You feel like a window of free time is just about to open, yet you feel as if your life is slipping away.  What happened to all of that time?  You travel with book in hand and a notepad, ready to jot down any ideas.  You're not armed with a knife or a gun, no!  You're armed with a notebook and a digital camera, ready to point and shoot at anything intriguing enough to take it out of its case.  Then there's always the time factor, will you get it out before the moment passes?  How long is a moment?  Shit, one just passed, shit another one.  Anything can be a moment.  You choose which moments to remember and some you forget.  It's as if this reality is filled with numbers of calculations of the various physical object's place in space.  The numbers just bounce off of you, since there's so many of them at once.  And you glow with a neon green, brighter than the lime you had earlier.  This aura of luminence perpetuates throughout, sending waves of nitrogen and carbon which change throughout the wave into whichever element they choose, transferring energy back and forth for infinite eternity.  The bind on your notebook starts to break and you feel your world collapsing around you, like the skies are caving in... until you look up and they return to standard position.  Suddenly the ground starts vibrating and you think you recognize the beat in that new Mariah Carey song but it's really just your imagination running amuck with mere coincidence of a single beat.  The beating coincides with your heart and you burst into diamonds that become ignited with the waves of elements coming into contact with the surrounding air.

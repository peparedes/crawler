I AM NOT a B-film fan.  My expieriences have not been good, and believe me I've seen some funkies.  But this does alright.  They apparently found some half decent actors that were apparently willing to work for peanuts, and they secured a descent blue screen and some quality footage. Lets say its not intolerable to watch and if you like sci-fi stuff, especially time travel, it's enjoyable."

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - With 14,000 laborers toiling day and night, the first of Dubai's three palm-shaped islands is finally about to get its first residents. 
 
The Palm Jumeirah, a 12-square-mile island group, is part of what's billed as the largest land-reclamation project in the world, the product of five years of brute hauling of millions of tons of Persian Gulf sand and quarried rock.

On Nov. 30, the palm will open to some 4,000 residents, said Issam Kazim, a spokesman for Dubai's state-owned developer Nakheel.

When fully complete by 2010, the Palm Jumeirah will be an offshore city, with some 60,000 residents and at least 50,000 workers in 32 hotels and dozens of shops and attractions, Nakheel said.

Observers say they are surprised that the fledgling developer has been able to build such a complex project more or less as planned, albeit with several snags that delayed the opening from last year.

""The project has captured people's imagination,"" said Colin Foreman of the Middle East Economic Digest. ""Nothing like it has been done anywhere else in the world.""

Nakheel's four island projects, the world's largest land reclamation effort, are reshaping Dubai's stretch of the Gulf coast.

The $14 billion project is a key part of this booming city's ambitions to rival Singapore and Hong Kong as a business hub, and surpass Las Vegas as a leisure capital.

The frenetic pace of development has utterly transformed Dubai from a sleepy trading and pearl-diving village in the 1950s to a flashy metropolis of 1.5 million.

The island's construction has not all been smooth, and most buyers were supposed to get keys to their island homes a year ago.

Some of the new land sank and Nakheel needed an extra year to add more and pack it with vibrating land compactors, Kazim said.

Reports from those who have wandered through the island's giant homes describe them as cheaply finished and set uncomfortably close to one another. Nakheel rejected an Associated Press request to visit the island.

Overburdened roads in Dubai's Jumeirah Beach neighborhood are expected to clog further as people begin moving onto the island, accessible, for now, by a single bridge. Mainlanders have already put up with years of road works and innumerable trucks hauling boulders to the island.

Those moving onto the Palm Jumeirah this year will have to live with construction for another three years, and then an influx of tourists. Most of the owners are foreigners, with Britons making up the largest group, Kazim said.

Many observers believe Dubai's frenetic homebuilding will soon outstrip demand.

""We've still got a shortage of properties in Dubai, but that's likely to become an excess in next six or 12 months,"" said Steve Brice, an economist with Standard Chartered Bank in Dubai.

Brice said year-old estimates that 50,000 housing units would hit the market in 2006 will be more than doubled. Nakheel, one of three big developers here, has said it will release 60,000 units in the 2nd half of 2006 alone.

Nakheel's two copycat Palms, the Palm Jebel Ali and Palm Deira, have also been delayed by design changes and other factors, Kazim said. A nearly finished fourth Nakheel archipelago, shaped like a map of the world, has attracted few buyers and remains mostly unsold. 

Kazim said The World's sales trouble stems from simple economics: Nakheel is selling empty islands for tens of millions of dollars only to builders promising low-density luxury. 

Dubai's government expects the Palm Jumeirah to become a signature tourist attraction, bringing in as many as 20,000 daily visitors, Kazim said. 

Meanwhile, laborers living in a cruise ship moored offshore are scrambling to finish enormous concrete houses that are crammed together on the palm island's 17 ""fronds."" The fronds are narrow peninsulas as long as a mile, attached to the island's main trunk. Nakheel will hand keys to owners of 1,350 homes by Nov. 30, Kazim said. 

Also nearing completion are 2,650 apartments in 20 high-rises that have sprung up on the island's trunk. The hulking complexes are visible from shore, where the sprawling island, with its dredges, highway overpasses and construction cranes has become a major eyesore for resort hotels on Dubai's once idyllic natural beaches. 

Even after the handover in November, less than half of the island's construction will be finished. Kazim said the project won't be done until nearly 2010, if things go according to Nakheel's current schedule. 

The 1,500 room Atlantis Hotel is already under construction by South Africa and Dubai-owned Kerzner International, and is expected to be finished in 2009. The hotel will be similar to its Atlantis hotel in The Bahamas. 

A redesigned Trump Hotel and Tower on the island is also expected to open sometime in 2009, Kazim said."

"event","Today I got in my car and the dam thing wouldn't start. This is the second time this has happened. Most probable cause is the ever-so-infamous starter.  So I say to myself ""Gwendaline, (don't ask) you should get this matter taken care of and NOW"" So, eventually my car starts, just like the last time, (I think it really is afraid of being towed, because it always works AFTER I call for Roadside Assistance) and I drive to a repair shop and they charge me 40 bucks and say ""we can't help you, go to your dealer, their the only ones who can save you now."" So I take my [recently renamed] Stupid Saturn to the dealership so they can charge me 40 buck and say ""Sell us your soul and chop off that arm, and we will fix your car""  BASTARDS!!
I have to dish out almost $600 to fix this stupid car, and the real pisser is, I have word that I'm not alone in this particular problem.  Apparently, a lot of Saturn Suckers find themselves reaching deep within their bowls to pull out that kinda wad, but does Satan, I mean, Saturn care. Hell no.
I called there Customer Service Care Center and the best they can do for me is give me a lousy 10% discount, and woowee, 2 (count 'em) 2 FREE Oil Changes.
Oh, that just makes this whole situation better, now doesn't it.
And then....
I come to work to this...

There's a story behind this pic.  Everyday I take a few ""back roads"" around 192 to avoid the Wicham stop light (a treacherous place)and I drive by a church who likes to share there word with everyone driving down Seminole.  Usually it's not that funny, sometimes I try to think of ways to rearrange the letters to say something else more entertaining (there's a word for that and it begins with an A, but hell if I can remember)  Well, this one almost caused an accident cuz I was laughing so hard. I thought I would share this with everyone. Enjoy."

I'v been listening to this band I stumbled upon during my LAUNCH rummage.  (I pick a band I like and hit Similar Artist and try different bands I never heard of) There really good, especially if you like that raw sound.  And I'm also enjoying And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead.  

Does anybody have any other Cool Music Suggestions?  I'm always looking for something different to listen too.

Yes, it used to happen in public, and let me tell you, people get really freaked out when you just start rollin' and cryin' with a gut bustin' laugh. Like while standing in line, or sitting on the bus, and of course theres the restraunt episodes that turn into a total mess.

Like earlier today, when I was completely irritated at by boss and I wanted to physically take him out with some cheesy wrestling move.  I cleared my mind and just thought of some stupid phrase like...""What I consider a good prank, most people consider a potential lawsuit""  I fucked it up earlier in my previous entry, sweet redemption.
Sometimes I think these little phrases would make good T-shirts.

I started to post them on my MySpace, but with little success.
So I am starting again.  

Caution: I am off my meds
(thought of this as I was walking to the mailboxes)

dont p*ss me off, i'm running out of places to hide the bodies. 

(someone shared this one with me, it kept me gigglin' for a while)

This is the one I thought of today:

F*ck Fashion (of course it has to be a shit brown tee shirt, because brown is the new black, I think?)"

"event","Recently someone who shall remain nameless has informed me of two very important things.

The things I say about other people are not funny but just plain mean.

AND

My idea of a good prank is most peoples idea of reason to get a lawyer.

So I think I'll just keep some things to myself from now on."

"event","I had the BEST Birthday of my life.  Many wonderful and unexpected things happened.  My family surprised me by bringing my long lost mother to me for a week.  I thought she was lost forever in a Pennsylvania snow drift.  Then they showered me with enough sugar injected foods to give me diabetes.
Mmmm, yummmm, diabetes.
Then I come home to find a dozen or so helium balloons.  Always a fun treat, especially with friends.  I only wish I could have gotten the Helium-Movie-Line jokes on camera.  And my new favoritest of all thingy.  An ipod.

I am a lucky, lucky girl

I realize deep in my heart, this will never, ever happen again.  Ever.
even though i will be 29 next year too"

"event","I have to get this out before I rip some stupid hicks head off.  His real name is Bryon, I call him JabberJaw, because the guy never, ever shuts up.  He is the new employee at my work.  He's replacing Jennifer.  I don't think I've ever mentioned Jennifer. Probably because she's quiet and easy to get along with.  But this guy, this guy is totally pissing me off.  If I hear, ""I hate to bother you, but..."" followed by some lame ass retarded question that is answered by me simply pointing my finger at what his blind ass can't see, I'm GOING TO KILL HIM.  Maybe not kill him for real, but definitely imagine good hiding places for his body.  It's not just the continuous questions, it's also the smokers breath that he insists on breathing on me when ever he is near.  And I mean NEAR, like creepy near.  And to look him in the eye is to look a dead fish in the eye and try to teach it how to swim again.  And don't get me started on his ""hot rod"".  It's some old eighties car, and it's a hunk of fixed up junk, but he likes it and insists on telling everyone how much he likes it. woo-hoo.
Tell me what is your first impression of a person who you know little about and who knows little about you and yet insists on telling you that his brother in law or whatever is a coke addict.  Isn't that personal information you save for family reunions and stuff.
Well, I feel better now."

TREASURED FRIEND

I lost a treasured friend today
The little dog who used to lay
Her gentle head upon my knee
And share her silent thoughts with me.
She'll come no longer to my call
Retrieve no more her favorite ball
A voice far greater than my own
Has called her to His golden throne.

Although my eyes are filled with tears
I thank Him for the happy years
He let her spend down here with me
And for her love and loyalty.
When it is time for me to go
And join her there, this much I know
I shall not fear the transient dark
For she will greet me with her bark."

So yea I went to the mall yesterday to buy some stuff for the birthday girl and ran into some guy I dated like in November. It was really weird cause I didnt even notice him until he stopped his car infront of me and was like ""Hey Natti How are you?"" I was like Super nice but in the back of my head i was like F**k YOU!! You guys know the story. This morning I woke up super scared and got out of bed A.S.A.P. I hate those nightmares that seem so realistic that when you wake up you touch your eyes and they are full of tears. Yes, that is how i woke up this morning. Tonight we are going out to a restaurant to eat, I dont know which one because we always have different choices in food. 

Tomorrow I have this huge test in Anthropology!! I am like super stressed. I have been studying like a mad man. Hopefully I will get an 'A'. This week was so awesome!! Math class was canceled for the week so I got to come home at noon :) Ewww I saw some unpleasant Panther ewww.Oh yea I went to a party on Saturday which was really fun. My mom got me Margaritas and then this Lady and I drank Cosmpolitans like water. I woke up at 6 A.M. at some random house. It was by far the shit.Omg GIRLS go to Guess In the Valencia Mall all the beautiful Coats, Skirts, Shoes, EVERYTHING is like 40% off!!!

Anyway the semester is almost over and I am passing all my classes with an A well math is a B ;/ God the guys in my math class have me on check! HEHEHE But I like it. I have all my classes planned out and I will leave COC June 2006 :) My primary school is USC. I want to major in LCSW and you all know that my MAIN goal is to be LAWYER. The marines keep calling since I told them i was thinking about being a lawyer for them.It's difficult though because you have your major and then you go to like boot camp competing agst badasses for Srgnt. If you make it you can go to law school with them if not you go back home a loser!Not to mention you have to sign for 4-5 years. Who knows maybe next year i will go for it ;)
Tomorrow there is no school yay! So awesome cause I get to sleep in ... heehhheheh (kinky laugh). Omg I found out that a girl who graduated with us is pregnant! What a fuckin shock. Horrible. I hate finding out shit like that makes me wonder too much. I wonder what i am going to do this weekend. My Brothers birthday is on Monday but i am pretty sure we are going to celebrate it on Sat or Sun cause if there is a Laker game he will prolly go then. MMMMMMM That means Colombian Empanadas, Buenelos, Pan De Bonos for us this weekend mmmmmmmmm My mom better not flake out on making this food. If you have never had Colombian food you are so missing out! O and the Colombian soda Colombiana is DELICIOUS. Damn it i just made myself hungry but since i am on a diet, i will go eat a healthy apple. What is up with guys loving phone sex? EHEHEHEH See ya."

and the fact that you didn't call
But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you
not even close,
not even a little bit, 
not even any at all.

"event","Today started off as a pretty good day all was going great until i realized i made the biggest mistake in my life. I took a chance with someone and he rather listen to the influence of the certain individuals than what he feels. To this person i would like to say it hurt what u said and i will not sit around and wait for u after u and u r friend have offended me. Anyways I went to target and bought some oreos and am now munching on them. I must go for tomorrow will be a long day."

OMG let me just say that i ran from Petit to Granada Hills High School handing out candy canes like if i was santa's lil helper ( senators lil helper). As I was giving out candy i felt someone scream ""Natalie"" and it was lil Justin with Jordan and Rob. Man hadnt seen those 2 in the longest, nice to see u guys again to bad i was on the run. As it came to the end the senators officers let me get on one of the horses... kinky.There were some pretty hot guys out there today!!!!

"event","Today started off pretty funny, I went to Notre Dame High School to take the SatII and when i got there I saw no one!!!! My first reaction was OMG WTF! As i drove aroung looking for the library i bumped into this major hot guy Jim. I asked him where the library was and he told me to park and he would take me so of course i did. To make a long story short i Love that school and the guys are not only hot but really nice. After arriving from Notre Dame i found out Taylor was coming over and we were going to have a niece aunt day:) Leah came over too and we went to the mall with Taylor, it was so hot there!!! 
Today was a rather sad day just thinking about how my cousin died yesterday.... I noticed that my aunt died in the beginning of the year and now my cousin dies at the end. I feel bad for my cousins who were left motherless, and in the case of my cousin her children are left orphans:( Well I am off to pick up Stephanie."

"event","Wow today started off so boring the only thing i was looking forward to was meeting up with Neir. When i got home from school i recieved a call from Lacey inviting me to her sleep over tonight, unfortunately i can't go because i have SatII tomorrow. But guess where???? Notre Dame High = hot guys!! So anyways i went to starbucks with Neir hung out talked about life and stuff. Dont you sometimes regret not doing something? I regret not telling this guy i liked that i liked him just because i was being a shallow bizzo! Oh well. The night closed out pretty funny i raced this guy Alex and then he asked me for my number while driving we almost crashed if it wasnt for Sherry ehhhehe thanks. Well i must go to bed now i have testing tomorrow ttfn"

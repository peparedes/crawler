You can just imagine my 'wonderful' (notice the sarcasm) mood right now! Well so, now I&nbsp;have to finish ALL my correct Language Art's homework...and turn it in tomorrow...ALONG with the addition math homework! I also have TWO tests; NOT one but TWO!; tests tomorrow to study for. . .Oh yeah, and let's not forget the jolly old Spanish Homework!!!! WRITE A SPEECH! I SUCK WITH SPEECHES! I'm sorry, about complaining so much, but I am REALLY pissed off right now. . .at myself...and at the WORLD! haha...well later...<br />Kaya</strong></font></p>"

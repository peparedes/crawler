I'm not particularly concerned with whether or not you like me, 
because I live to like you and... and I can't like you anymore. 
So... so when you're feeling real low and... and dirty, 
and your heart is splattered all over hell, 
don't look to me to pump you back up
 'cause... 'cause... 'cause maybe for the first time in your life I WON'T BE THERE!"

I said 'yes, please don't drink. It makes you argumentative and i don't want ot fight while baking cookies.' she said okay and put the bottle back. OBVIOUSLY this was only when i was looking because i was told to go upstairs at about 11 o'clock so she could 'talk' to dad. I said no I'm busy wrapping presents but said i would go but come back in an hour. cause you know i'm 5 and can't hear my parents fighting with out what? crying? screaming? WTF.
I only went because its no use fighting with a drunk you are always wrong no matter how obviously right you are. and i get a text 45 min later telling me to come down stairs and get all the junk i left. FUCK YOU. that JUNK was the stuff i was using to BE PRODUTIVE before you so rudly interupted me.so i came downstairs and finished what i was doing and noticed hmm... my mom can't walk in a straight line ... and she only has one eye open. nice.

I can move on because i don't think about him anymore and so what
he's rude
and he ignores me
I'm over it&nbsp;
Finally
and then you&nbsp;see something that reminds you of him and you freeze before promptly removing it from your&nbsp;vision
and then you realize&nbsp;
you were wrong&nbsp;
SHIT&nbsp;
and it hurts more the second time around because you realize what an idiot you are&nbsp;
but you can't help it&nbsp;

I need&nbsp;to be over it&nbsp;
NEED to be over it&nbsp;

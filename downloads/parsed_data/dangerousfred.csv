So I had this idea.  Today is the birthday of not only noted surrealist moustache-wearer Salvador Dali, but also brilliant physicist & strip-club patron Richard Feynman.

I can't remember if I've mentioned my idea for a novel about the Emperor Norton and Jack Kirby teaming up to save the Earth from time-traveling space aliens, but I had an even better idea:

He's a surrealist artist! He's a bongo-playing nuclear physicist! THEY FIGHT CRIME!!

""DALI AND FEYNMAN: PRIVATE DETECTIVES""

Would that not be made of seventeen and three-quarters different flavors of awesome? I'm thinking Nathan Fillion as Dali and Brad Pitt as Feynman.

The worst of the year is gone, and we're all starting fresh in 2010.

Universe, you have received your marching orders.  You are not allowed to suck so much this year.  

Fortunately, I didn't resolve not to enjoy a small bit of <a href=""http://whatever.scalzi.com/2006/09/26/how-to-make-a-schadenfreude-pie/"">schadenfreude</a> from time to time, so I can grin a small, evil grin at the news that <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091231/ap_on_en_ot/us_limbaugh_hospital"">unrelenting bigotry, blatant idiotic lies, oxycontin abuse and a purported fondness for Dominican Rentboys</a> does, in fact, have Consequences.

I'm not a big follower of the sports - in fact, I find few things more tedious - but I bet that I could, with only a little googling, find at least 10 female <i>human beings</i> worthy of being in a ""best list"".  

I mean, it's not that hard for me, and I'm not even a goddamn sports writer.

And you know what else?  He was a pedophile.  So quit with the Sainthood applications, you media fuckwits.  He's dead, we can goddamn move on now.  There are things much, much more important than a pedophile that got away with it dying from a drug overdose.

What is your most guilty pleasure?</b><br />Hurm.&nbsp; I don't feel guilty about things I enjoy, but I suppose the local restaurant that serves my favorite burgers also happens to be staffed by women in short skirts.&nbsp; The skirts are incidental to the quality of the burgers and selection of beer, but most folks assume I go for the cleavage and skirts.<br /><br /><b>3.Have you ever seen someone die?</b><br />Apart from the hit and run Fabu and I saw over a decade ago, no.<br /><br /><b>4.Are you confused as to what lies ahead of you?</b><br />I try not to fret about that too much, though I don't always succeed.&nbsp; Not confused at the moment, but that's because at the moment, the future's wide-fuckin'-open.&nbsp; Once I start getting job offers, it'll narrow down a bit.<br /><br /><b>5.What was the last movie you saw, for pleasure, and would you recommend it?</b><br /><i>Justice League: The New Frontier</i>.&nbsp; Hell yes, it's a damn fine movie.&nbsp; Apart from the cast, it's a good story and the animation style really links it to the period it covers.<br /><br /><b>6.Do you have a secret?</b><br />Yes.&nbsp; Everyone should have secrets. <br /><br /><b>7.If the person you like does not accept you, would you continue to wait for them to change their feelings?</b><br />I'll mope about it for a while, but if they make it clear they're done with me, then fuck 'em.&nbsp; I'm done too.<br /><br /><b>8.If the person you secretly like is already attached, what would you do?</b><br /><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://fabu.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;"" /></a><a href=""http://fabu.livejournal.com/""><b>fabu</b></a></div> was winding up a relationship when I met her.&nbsp; I didn't much care, because the guy she was dating was an asshole.&nbsp; I also derive some morbid, self-punishing pleasure from mooning over people I can't have, but I don't like to let that go on too long.&nbsp; Except for Bernadette Peters.&nbsp; <br /><br /><b>9.Is there anything that has made you unhappy recently?</b><br />Getting laid off has been bittersweet.&nbsp; The downtime is nice, but, hell, I gave 10 years of my life to that job, and now it's over.&nbsp; <br /><br /><b>10.If you could have chosen at birth whether to be a boy or a girl, which would you be?</b><br />Boy, I think.&nbsp; Unless I could do it a la carte - ""Yeah, I'll take Peeing Standing Up, Multi-Orgasmic, Facial Hair and Good At Social Cues"".<br /><br /><b>11.Which of the 7 Deadly Sins do you think you relate to the most &amp; why?</b><br />Wrath, I'm sad to say.&nbsp; It's also the Sin I've made the most progress on mastering.&nbsp; As far as which ones I like, Lust and Gluttony are lots of fun.&nbsp; Avarice and Sloth ain't so bad, either.&nbsp; Envy, not so much.&nbsp; Pride, though - that's a tough nut to crack as well.&nbsp; Wrath and Pride are the ones most common in me, I think.<br /><br /><b>12.Thunderstorms - cool or scary?</b><br />Wicked cool.<br /><br /><b>13.You can have one night of passion - who with?</b><br />The question says one night, not one person.&nbsp; So:&nbsp; Johnny Depp, Bernadette Peters, Susan Sarandon, John Barrowman and <i>That Redhead I Saw That Day In Atlanta That Smiled At Me And Walked Away With The Sunlight Streaming Through Her Hair</i>.&nbsp; In a large hot tub.<br /><br /><b>14. Would you rather be a really good person or a really interesting person?</b><br />Interesting.&nbsp; There's always time to become good later, but being interesting takes experience.<br /><br /><b>15. Do you believe in some form of life after death?</b><br />No.&nbsp; What we've got, that's what we get.&nbsp; Make this life last and make it sweet, because when it's over, it's all over.&nbsp; <br /><br /><b>16. Which fictional character could you most see yourself marrying?</b><br />Susan Ivanova.&nbsp; <br /><br /><b>17. Best sex: rough and fast or slow and tender?</b><br />All of the above, TYVM.<br /><br /><b>18. Do you have a motto? If yes which one?</b><br />""Fuck 'em."" - It's kind of a family motto.&nbsp; Also, from Harlan Ellison's ""The Cheese Stands Alone"", I've clung to this one when things are especially shitty:&nbsp; ""It may be the tag-end of a shitty life, but it's <i>my</i> shitty life.""<br /><br /><b>19. If you could go back in time and delete one movie from your brain, what would it be?</b><br />Hmmm.&nbsp; <i>High Spirits</i>?&nbsp; <i>Attack of the Clones</i>?&nbsp; <i>Club Paradise</i>?&nbsp; There's so many to choose from!&nbsp; <br /><br />No, I've got it.&nbsp; I want to delete <i>Buckaroo Banzai</i> so I can enjoy discovering it all over again.<br /><br /><b>20. What place most speaks to you?</b><br />Wales.&nbsp;"

You goddamn twisted motherfuckers.

I'm on a conference call, and the director of my team just announced that we're all getting outsourced to fucking India.

You shitlicking ratfuckers.

No word on an end date yet.

For ten years, I've worked my ass off to protect this network of fiber optic cables. For ten years, there has been a grand total of ZERO - MOTHERFUCKING ZERO - fiber cuts that resulted from errors on my part or on the part of my team. Now, we're told that we're expected to train the motherfuckers that are going to replace us.

Don't tell me I'm a fucking ""employee owner"" of this goddamn company. Don't tell me that, and then tell me I'm out of a motherfucking job. Don't piss down my neck and tell me it's raining - I'm not a fucking idiot, and I know what this means, and I know what I am. I'm a fucking cog in the machine to you goat-raping bastards, and it doesn't matter how much this fucks up the network, because you shitheads are thinking about your stock options, not the livelihood of thousands of hard-working people.

"event","<p>One of Daughter's friends had a birthday party yesterday, and I was reminded again that no matter how much I complain about my kids, they're really pretty well-behaved, especially in public.</p><p>The party was for a 7-year-old, but several parents brought not just the child that was invited to the party, but one or more younger siblings (3-4 yrs). The party was at a bowling alley, and two of the younger children were especially disruptive - running around and tripping the foul sensors for other children, rolling balls down other kids' lanes, pressing the ""reset"" button in the middle of a frame, and other actions indicative of what my grandmother called a ""Heathen Savage Upbringing"".</p><p>What, you may ask, did their parents do?</p><p>One dad just smiled indulgently and would occasionally say, in a mild tone of voice, ""Aaaasssshhhlleeee, dooooonnnnnn't doooo thaaaat."" Other than that, not much. I wound up corralling the younger kids before they interfered with my daughter and the kids bowling in her lane, because I could see that the older kids were getting very frustrated. At 6-7 years of age, kids really want to succeed at tasks, and interference from ""babies"" is going to frustrate them and lead to big meltdowns. Not a single other parent bothered to do a frickin' thing. The birthday boy's parents were obviously frustrated by this - they had to pay for lane/shoe rental for these uninvited heathen savages - but they were trying to be polite. Fortunately, I didn't mind being the Bad Guy, and wound up steering the worst-behaved child (Little Aaaasssshhhlleeee) back to her simpering, spineless father and saying, ""Hey, you might want to keep a close eye on your daughter before she hurts herself - those bowling lanes are really slippery!"" I got a nasty glare out of him, but nothing else - no ""Oh! Sorry!"", no ""Right, of course."" Not even a ""Go fuck yourself, pal!""</p><p>On the way home, I stopped and bought some ice cream to take home for all 3 kids. </p><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://fabu.livejournal.com/profile""><img width=""17"" height=""17"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif"" alt=""[info]"" style=""border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom;"" /></a><a href=""http://fabu.livejournal.com/""><b>fabu</b></a></div> saw the ice cream and wondered why I'd bought it, and I told her and the kids it was because I had been reminded what great kids I have.<p>&nbsp;</p>"

"event","Yesterday, an email was sent out advising all employees of our New Corporate Overlords that there was now regular <b>inner-office</b> mail between [<i>fredstown</i>] and [<i>headquartersville</i>].<br /><br />Inner-office.<br /><br /><i>::facepalm::</i><br /><br />Today, I got my 2006 review.  Now, last year, my 2005 review was OK, except that Management had (a) informed me that I needed to work on improving my communications skills (!) and (b) cut and pasted my review with the other guys in my group, such that we all got identical reviews except for the names up top.<br /><br />Laughable, and a good example of how Old Employer managed to demonstrate that no one above supervisor level really gave two shits about anyone below them.  (along with no raises in 5 years - for anyone, bonuses only for salespukes and executurds and Christmas parties to which spouses and significant others were not invited)<br /><br />So back to this year.<br /><br />I go up to Management's office, sit down and get handed the last official document pertaining to my tenure with Old Employer - everything else from here on out is all about New Corporate Overlords.  It's the same as last year.<br /><br />As in identical.  To the letter.<br /><br />How do I know?  Because Management forgot to change the date up top, so it still reads ""2005 Performance Review"".<br /><i><br />::sighs heavily::</i><br /><br />Do any of you, dear readers, wonder why I drink so much?"

Those in <i>Recently Purchased Telcomm Company</i> [NOTE: Like, say, Dangerousfred] will receive bonuses according to the rules of <i>RPTC</i> as in previous years there."":<br /><br /><blockquote><b>TRANSLATION:</b> ""Yeah, we get bonuses here at <i>NOC</i>. I seem to recall that no one but Sales Pukes and Executards get bonuses at <i>RPTC</i>, right? Damn. Sucks to be you.""<br /></blockquote><br />(2) ""If an employee is in a redundant position, we notify them of that on the first Friday of the month and then they are released at the end of 30 days.""<br /><br /><blockquote><b>TRANSLATION:</b> ""We find that the general low-level fear and anxiety does not provide a sweet enough taste to our Demon Overlords, so we have decided to set up a system that allows us to have a monthly harvest of anxiety, dread and terror followed by a brief period of relief, and then a gently-increasing pileup of dread and anxiety again.""<br /></blockquote><br />(3) ""We will be reviewing the compensation levels of every employee in both companies to ensure they are within the industry standard compensation range for their position. We will then make necessary adjustments to bring all employees in to that compensation range.""<br /><br /><blockquote><b>TRANSLATION:</b> ""We'll see how much you make. If you make more than the average, you're gonna get shitcanned. If you make less than the average, well, we just fired the folks making over the average, so your previously-low wage is now 'average'!

"event","Yoinked from <a href=""http://linaelyn.livejournal.com/profile"">linaelyn</a>:  <br /><br /><i>Fill this out about your SENIOR year of high school! The longer ago it was, the more ""fun"" the answers will be.</i><br /><br /><b>1. Who was your best friend?</b><br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"">I had two:&nbsp; Matt and Raymond.&nbsp; We played D&amp;D and slacked and occasionally got drunk. <br /><br /><b>2.What sports did you play?</b><br />Does Quiz Bowl count?<br /><br /><b>3. What kind of car did you drive?</b><br />The 1978 VW Rabbit was supposed to be mine, but I usually ended up driving our Ford Gran Torino station wagon with the faux-wood paneling on the side.&nbsp; I wasn't terribly concerned with appearances.<br /><br /><b>4. It's Friday night, where were you?</b><br />At Matt's house or mine, gaming.&nbsp; Sometimes we'd get some beer and go down to Goody Road and hang out and drink the beer there, hiding it when the cops cruised down the road.<br /><br /><b>5. Were you a party animal?</b><br />No.&nbsp; I drank more than I should have, but didn't get invited to parties and didn't much care to go to any.<br /><br /><b>6. Were you considered a flirt?</b><br />No.&nbsp; Though I didn't understand it at the time, I was (and still am) bisexual.&nbsp; In rural Georgia, I didn't know that was an option.&nbsp; I wanted to date girls but couldn't understand why I had dreams about kissing boys sometimes.&nbsp; It was all academic, really, because I was low enough on the social ladder to not qualify for real dates.<br /><br /><b>7. Ever skip school?</b><br />Yep.&nbsp; First day of school, they sent home a slip for my parents to sign so they had their signatures on file.&nbsp; I got two copies, had my parents sign one and I signed the other.&nbsp; I turned in the one I signed, and from then on I just rewrote any notes my parents sent to school.&nbsp; I'd write myself notes to leave school early, arrive late or leave campus at lunchtime (for a while, I ran a moderately profitable fast food delivery service).<br /><br /><b>8. Were you a nerd?</b><br />Yes.&nbsp; Comics, Star Trek and D&amp;D.&nbsp; With a little independent study in the field of improvised demolitions and flammable munitions.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; - Is home with mono.<br /><br /><b>10. Did you get suspended/expelled?</b><br />No, but I got sent to the office on occasion.&nbsp; Funny how detailing one's Constitutional rights and one's father's ""friends in the ACLU"" tends to make school administrators take the path of least resistance.<br /><br /><b>11. Can you sing the fight song?</b><br />Yes, but only for Miskatonic University:<br />&lt;i&gt;We're the Fighting Octupi of Miskatonic U<br />We can call on Azathoth, we can summon Hastur too<br />Is you really piss us off we'll summon Cthulhu<br />We're the Fighting Octupi of Miskatonic U!<br />GOOOOOOOO PODS!&lt;/i&gt;<br /><br /><b>12. Who was your favorite teacher?</b><br />Mr. Byrd - math, also the coach of the Quiz Bowl team.&nbsp; He respected me and treated me like I knew WTF I was talking about.<br />Mr. Wright - english.&nbsp; A stylish man, educated at Tuskeegee.&nbsp; The teacher that made diagramming sentences almost interesting.&nbsp; He died a few years back - my father tells me that it was common knowledge when he died that he was gay and had AIDS.&nbsp; I wish I'd kept in better touch with him after I graduated.<br />Mrs. Eubanks - english.&nbsp; She was unfailingly positive and supportive of all of her students.&nbsp; Most of the boys in the school had a crush on her. <br /><br /><b>13. Favorite class?</b><br />I enjoyed English and Writing classes, Chemistry was also loads of fun even though I hated the teacher.<br /><br /><b>14. What was your school's full name?</b><br />Manchester High School<br /><br /><b>15. What was the mascot?</b><br />The Blue Devils<br /><br /><b>16. Did you go to Prom?</b><br />Senior year only.&nbsp; I took the first girl that said yes, Angie Somethingorother.&nbsp; We had fun, though I didn't kiss her goodnight like she apparently expected.<br /><br /><b>17. If you could go back and do it over, would you?</b><br />Only if I could remember what I know now and bypass some of my&nbsp; more embarassing errors.&nbsp; I think I'd try to talk to my parents about my depression then as well, in hopes I could pick up some decent coping methods earlier in life.&nbsp; Oh, and I'd save up my graduation money so I could buy some stock in Dell and Microsoft and then I wouldn't have to work ever again.<br /><br /><b>18. What do you remember most about graduation?</b><br />I was a little bit drunk.&nbsp; I was also pissed off because I wasn't giving a speech - the teacher in charge of the ceremony had a serious hate on for me and she felt I was a little too ""confrontational"".&nbsp; I remember shouting ""FUCK OFF YOU BITCH"" at her after the ceremony was over.<br /><br /><b>19. Favorite memory of your Senior Year?</b><br />Not school related at all.&nbsp; My father and I drove to Birmingham, AL so I could go to a scholarship doololly at Birmingham-Southern College.&nbsp; It was the first time I really had a chance to just talk to my father, and the first time he treated me like an adult.<br /><br /><b>20. Where were you on senior skip day?</b><br />We didn't have those in my high school, I don't think.<br /><br /><b>21. Did you have a job your senior year?</b><br />I was a stock clerk at Maxway, a department store chain that was like a dingy, crappy low-rent nightmare of Wal-Mart.<br /><br /><b>22. Where did you go most often for lunch?</b><br />The cafeteria.&nbsp; I usually bought my lunch, though sometimes I'd make myself a sammich or bring a tin of sardines.<br /><br /><b>23. Have you gained weight since then?</b><br />Yes.&nbsp; I was about 5'6"" and 120 pounds when I graduated high school.&nbsp; By the time I finished college, I was 6'1"" and just under 200.&nbsp; Now I'm... well, let's just say I'm heavier and leave it at that.<br /><br /><b>24. What did you do after graduation?</b><br />Went to a party with the other seniors.&nbsp; Got drunk, but my older brother was there and he guided me home and got me upstairs without my parents finding out I was drunk.<br /><br /><b>25. When did you graduate?</b><br />1985<br /><br /><b>26. Who was your Senior homecoming date?</b><br />No one.&nbsp; I went by myself, got threatened by a football player for wearing an American flag tie, slashed the football player's tires and left early to go play Gamma World with my friends Matt and Raymond.<br /><br /><b>27. Are you going to your ten year reunion?</b><br />Nope, didn't go.&nbsp; Missed my 20th, too.&nbsp; Probably going to miss my 25th - I think I've covered my tracks enough that they can't find me.&nbsp; Hell, I don't even remember most of my classmates' names.<br /><br /><b>28. Who was your home room teacher?</b><br />Mr. Byrd - our school had a different system when I went there - two classes per quarter, each class was 2 1/2 hours long, with about 2 hours in the middle for lunch/""tutorial"", which is when we did Quiz Bowl practice.&nbsp; I was in Byrd's tutorial period, and when we didn't have a match coming up, we got to just goof off.<br /><br /><b>29. What music did you listen to?</b><br />David Bowie, the Sex Pistols, The Who, The Beatles, INXS, the soundtrack to &lt;i&gt;Repo Man&lt;/i&gt;.<br /><br /><b>30. Who will repost this?</b><br />Idunno.&nbsp; Someone what wants to, I reckon.</div>"

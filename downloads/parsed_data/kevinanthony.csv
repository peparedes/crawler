"event","i was late for my 8:00 class i didnt want to go anyway we dont do any thing but sit in there and do nothing, i've already missed alot so i went. Coach made us have a damn meeting at 11:00 just to tell us to meet at 4:00 for a shoot around, he could have just told us to meet at 4 that was a big waste of time he always feels the need to waste our time. i thought about debbie alot today, i guess if me and ###### are ment to be we will. Fucking angie called me she made her sister talk at first thats crazy. i was wondering what the hell she wanted, but we talked. it was a whole bunch of nothing so whatever. We had a game tody we kicked allan u's ass. after the game debbie wanted to come over and spend time with me, we hung out for a little while but wee didnt do anything. oh shit i was about to kill this dude named keith it started off as fun then he got mad. i was so pissed at him i like him a lot so i told him im going to step, i wanted to kick his ass. he went and let frank pump him up and i was roasting his ass and he got big. anyway i think im going to give debbie a chance to be my girl but i know thats not where my heart is, we been talking for a while. im just so unsure."

"event","Ok my day was good I guess, I was really tried all day though. Maybe because last night I was up all night, I had to do it real big though. That shit makes me wake up tired as hell, i almost missed my ten o'clock because i wanted to sleep a few more minutes. I got my lazy ass up and went on time. All my other classes went smooth by my damn history teacher want to go outside and side in the grass and teach us, i was pissed about that shit. Freshmen sim was straight because she is so damn dumb.

I wanted to take a damn nap before practice but Debbie wanted to see me so i hung with he until three thirty and went on to practice. Now I'm really convinced that the varsity coach is crazy, he knew I had to play with the jv tonight and he made go hard at practice, i was pissed. Then try changed the time of the game and I didnt get to eat dinner so I was playing on a empty tank. But, I still had ninteen ponits I had a good second half, we still lost. 

After the game me Corey {roommate} Landon {home boy}, went to subway. I killed that sub. I got biggest cramp in my legs, and these niggas was laughing at me. So i showered and then Debbie called and said she was hungry so I took her to subway {that's the only restaurant close by}. So we went and we hung out for a while and now I'm here. 

Debbie is so cool, and beautiful everything she is great, she is say shes going to love me and all this but i cant. I like her a lot but my heart is back home. I think its is over between me and ###### but I cant stop loving her. Its almost been a year since we got together and every time I talk to her I just feel all crazy inside like we were still together. But I guess it maybe time to move on, me and ###### are really great friends. I need her in my life. She makes my world turn."

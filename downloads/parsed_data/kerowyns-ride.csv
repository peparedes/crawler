"event","Yeah, haven't updated this one in awhile. So one of my ex's, the one who also has an LJ, is leaving for Scotland on July 22nd for a conference. I'm very happy for him, and we still talk. He put in an entry talking about how he hoped that day would be better than July 22nd of 2004. It took me a minute to figure out what he was talking about, but then I realized that was the day I broke up with him. I don't even remember which days I broke up with my ex's, except for the most recent, and that was because it was the night of the Presidential election! Does that make me horrible or something? He's still moping around about it, and I'm sitting here drooling over any hot guy that comes within  my visual radius. *sigh* Oh well. What really sparked this is that he has an entry for July 22nd that I'm blocked from. It makes me wonder what he wrote. Not that I really want to read about yet another life that I've supposedly ruined. It's not like I'm a complete bitch when I break up with a guy!"

"event","One of my girls is dealing with a problem that I've had to deal with many a time. The problem is named Needy Guys. Her boyfriend has repeatedly told her she is the perfect girlfriend, that she is perfect for him, yadda yadda. Except they've only been going out for about two months. Now she wants time off but she is afraid she is going to hurt him. So, I guess what I want to know, is why can't people realize that in some situations it is alright to be selfish? If you know the person isn't right for you, then the relationship can only end in more pain further down the road if you don't break it off right at that moment. Of course, this is one lesson I had to learn the hard way. I don't know. I wish I could do it for her. She's only eighteen, this is her first real boyfriend. She needs to learn, but I hope she doesn't spend as much time agonizing over it as I think she is going to."

"event","Good: Bryce Gabriel Bess was born this morning at 5:50. He weighed in at 5lbs 12oz and 18 inches long. He's absolutely adorable. I held him for about 20 minutes until he got hungry, then he went back to his momma, one of my friends here on campus.
Bad: I have a physics quiz that I really need to be studying for.
Ugly: The water main for the Quad broke. Fortunately, Altman is the first building on the circuit, and the break was between our building and the rest of the Quad, so our water is good. However, the water is questionable for the rest of the Quad, and downright nasty for Kelly, another building. There, the water pressure sucks and the water is brown. So, we're about to be descended upon by all the other residents who want to take a shower. I was just starting to study for physics when i got the call from the front desk to warn my residents to not drink or use the water, as a precaution. Fun! Somehow, I think it is a good thing that I took my shower at noon... I thought I caught a whiff of something nasty when I was showering, and now that is freaking me out. I had previously put it off to one of my girls having an upset stomach and the smell drifting, but now I'm not so sure, especially since I learned this is the second water main break to occur on campus today..."

"event","I'm sick of dealing with men. I've decided to swear the whole lot off for awhile. Being single was never really a problem for me. I was worried since I went two years from the last boyfriend to the first boyfriend of last year, but then I went through four boyfriends over the course of one year. What started this rant, you might ask? Maybe it has something to do with my latest ex that completely ruined my evening for me. Ya see, he IM'd me last night and told me that he was going to pop over here for awhile because he wanted to talk to me. We broke up on election night, btw. Anyhoo, I told him that I wouldn't be home, I'd actually be at his res hall attending two programs that I've been looking forward to all week. One was ""Girls' Night Out"" which turned out to be worth the anticipation. It was a blast and relieved so much stress. it was great to just be girl for the first time all year, talk about girl stuff, do girly crafts and enjoy an environment that is exceedingly rare on a campus with a ratio of three guys to every girl. It was awesome. So after that program, which ended around 10:30, I went up to another fellow RA's program, which was called ""Crazy Awesome Game Night"". I agreed to come and provide some CD's of techno with the contingency that he and his boyfriend teach me how to dance. On my way up to the program, my ex tracked me down. It took me a good five minutes (five minutes in which I could have been dancing) for him to cough up that he already had a girlfriend, something that I had expected. I could even guess who the girlfriend was. Afterall, he had talked about her enough. What I hadn't expected was the fact that he had left my place, driven to her place and asked her out. Made me feel real good. So, being the person was, I wasn't going to let him see how pissed I was. I told him great, have fun, and went to dance. I wanted nothing more at this point than to burn my anger off be dancing all hours of the night. Jon and his boyfriend accommadated me for about a half hour. Then Jon had to go take care of something, then his boyfriend wandered off, and my techno CD that had been going was switched out for rap. I hate dancing to rap. I don't like rap to begin with. So the girl that had put in rap asked me if I wanted to learn how to line dance. No, thank you. So I packed up my stuff and left. I think Jon was a bit disappointed, but I hope he understood. I'll explain it to him tomorrow, at band. I needed to burn off mad so bad, but there was nothing I could do. I wanted to go work out, to dance, something to burn off all of this energy, but there was absolutely nothing I could do. Then, one of my friends, who happens to be a resident, gave me a good suggestion: who's to keep me from dancing in my room? Absolutely no one. I can even turn off the lights so I don't cast a shadow on the blinds and won't be embarrassed. So, I think that's what I'm going to do. Maybe. I'm going to watch an episode of Mythbusters first. If I haven't cooled off by then, I'll try it. One thing I was not expecting was to love dancing as much as I love music. Jon had said ""I know you know music. Therfor you know how dance. You just haven't figured it out yet."" Surprisingly, he was right. So, there ya go. Now I understand why my sister likes to dance so much."

"event","So, I just got dumped for the first time. I'm not really that upset. I mean, I liked Jeff, liked him more than any other boyfriend, but I'm not upset as most girls seem to get when they get dumped. We had more of a close friendship than a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. I hope things don't change too much. Yeah, we won't be dating, but I hope we can still talk like we always have. I seem to have this problem. The only guys that I am truly comfortable with seem to end up my friends. Jeff tried to be discreet about it, but he ended up dumping me in the entry hall of the door to Altman, and I'm pretty sure one of my residents figure out what was going on. The boys that were in the room with her didn't seem to realize what had happened not ten feet away, but I'm positive she did. She didn't try to convince me to stay in the lounge with her and the others like she normally would. Hopefully she won't go telling everyone. It's not something an RA likes her residents to know. An RA should maintain an presence of perfection. It's called life in the fishbowl. Everyone can see you at all times. The RA has the perfect family, the perfect GPA, the perfect study habits, gets along with everyone, likes everyone, and never gets dumped by her boyfriend. Ya know, I am a little sad, but more for the disappearing of possibilities. Ah well. I need to make myself appear perfect once again."

Well, as usual I am behind on my calculus. The only problem is that I have no clue what is going on in class. The teacher says we're doing something called space curves. Unfortunately everytime he says that, my mind zips off on a curve to space where I daydream about handsome body guards in the Harrington Steadholder's Guard and space battles and crap. Somehow calculus isn't as appealing as that. I also have discovered this truly awesome medicine that covers up most of my cold symptoms. Unfotunately, it keeps me wired.

"event","So, I always hear about how guys cannot have PMS, but I'm pretty sure that is wrong. I mean, PMS is symptoms caused by the fluctuations in hormones before a woman has her period. While a guy doesn't have a period, he does have the same hormones as women, or male equivalents of. They are just at different levels. So, logic should state that hormones can fluctuate. Therefor, men can have male pms. Right? I swear, Jeff has PMS today. He's pissed because his football team trounced another football team 63-13. Now, is that logical? Now, maybe it does show a little bit of a lack of sportsmanship. However, when Jeff was explaining it to me, he said that when you are ahead by forty before half-time, you should let the team relax. He defined relaxed as keeping your first string warm and dressed out. So I asked him if they put their second and third sting at all. However, no one is posting stats, so he can't be sure that the first string stayed in the entire game. However, he says, judging by the typical University of Arkansas athletic department, they only replaced the first string as need. I just said ""right"" and went on. I wish there were a way to nod agreeably over cyberspace...."

"event","So, I have one big announcement to make: I'M SINGLE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Woohoo! Whew. Had to get that out of my system. I'm afraid to check my other LJ because I'm worried about what kind of angsty stuff he's posted. See, that's the problem with dating someone who also maintains a LJ account. When you get ready to break up with him you have to start another accounts. That is why I will never give a perspective boyfriend the account name. Damn, I've already done that. Ah well. He doesn't know about this one, hehehe! Anyhoo, so I've got my eye on my next victim, and surprisingly enough, I'm actually excited about dating him. I think he's waiting before he asks me out, since it wouldn't be polite to ask me out the same day I break up with a previous boyfriend. He did jokingly ask me out though. Michele and I were giggling over it after I broke up with my boyfriend.Hmmmm...he needs a nickname now. I'll have to think about that one. It actually seems wierd to have added yet another  boyfriend to the club of guys whose lives I have ruined. And I'm dead serious about that. I seem to ruin the life of every boyfriend that I date. They all turn gay or wander around aimlessly in a depressed haze. Anyhoo, I feel absolutely no regret about dumping the old boyfriend, which makes me feel like a bitch. When I said I felt like a bitch, he did not hasten to correct me, which, of course, made me feel wonderful, the suchandsuch. So, all I need now is the next guy to notice me. He's noticed me, I should say, but I'm waiting for him to ask me out. i consider it a bad sign when the guy doesn't ask me out. If he doesn't have enough spine to ask me out, then he most definitely does not have enough spine to date me. I tend to take over. Anyhoo, off to do ochem. Talk to you all later."

"event","So Jeff and I, now known collectively as Trouble (as dubbed by our boss), went on our duty rounds this evening and we get a call from the front desk to stop by this one room. Chaz, the front desk worker, wouldn't tell us what was wrong, just told us to stop by the room. So we go down there and the lady says, okay, look out the window. So I did. She said, see the black thing? I said yes. She said look behind it. I said, Wow. There, lying on the roof, was a rusted grenade. I am dead serious. There was a grenade on our roof. We determined it to be dead because there was no pin and no clip thingy (Jeff has an explosives minor, so he would know), but we couldn't go out onto the roof to get it without permission from Dana. So we go talk to her. Dana didn't believe us, but we convinced her there really was a grenade on the roof. She ended up calling the other RD for advice, then called UMRPD and directly talked to an officer instead of sending it out over the airwaves of dispatch. Three officers showed up and they, too, determined it to be dead. They went out on the roof and retrived it and then stood around concocting funny ideas to use the grenade for, such as putting in a new primer cap so it makes a loud bang, but causes no damage. Then gathering all the campers beneath the second floor balcony, throwing it and yelling ""Grenade!"" After that, we ran into Sgt. Young (the best police officer on this planet, other than Eddie) and Dana as they were standing in the hallway during our next duty round. They proceeded to reminisce about all the trouble Jeff Green and I have gotten into the past few weeks and how, while none of it was our fault, the wierdest stuff always happened on our shift. Such as the pool breaking. Such as the cue ball hitting a kid's head. Such as a computer monitor shoved down the trash shut. Such as a grenade on the roof. Sgt Young also proclaimed that I am the only girl she knows who can find alcohol in the room of a resident in a building that is supposed to be empty. Jeff got a kick out of that. Anyhoo, I'm off to bed. Thought a little humor was in order."

"event","I had an interesting discussion this morning (as in 1 a.m.) with one of my residents, Kat and another of my residents, Justin, about feminism and how it has impacted the workplace and modern relationships. Justin was complaining about the rumor that women aren't letting men buy them stuff anymore, yada yada, and Kat and I explained about life as a woman. He went on to talk about how Rolla women (aka UMR women) are worse than most women when it comes to the feminist viewpoint. We explained about how Rolla women are surrounded by men on a 3:1 ratio and how the littlest weakness would be percieved as a major pitfall, maybe not consciously, but unconsciously. Rolla men are proud of the Rolla women, but they are still plagued by the usual pitfalls of the usual stereotypes. I think the biggest example would be how proud Rolla men are of ""their"" women. I also learned during the course of this discussion that I actually have a reputation as a heart breaker and it was confirmed that yes, I really did ruin Sean's life. Justin kinda blamed me, being a guy, but Kat totally sided with me, informing Justin that I had no control over how attached a guy became to me. Through this discussion, I've also gathered that the rumors of a break-up between me and Matt sometime in the future are making the rounds again. Justin was dropping some not so subtle hints that I better not hurt Matt because Matt is a ""really good guy"". Like I have any control over that! It's not like I set out to trample the hearts of men everywhere. I tell every guy that I get into a relationship with that I'll have no time and I like my space. Every guy says, yeah, whatever, and I know that in their little minds they're thinking about the stories they'll tell the children. About how they had to seriously court mommy and convince her that he was the right guy and how he was right in the end. Keep in mind that he came home from work to his stay-at-home wife and dozens of children, and, oh yeah, his wife does have an M.D., but she doesn't use it. He let her go to medical school, then they settled down and had a family. I don't think the problem is me at all. I think it has to do with guys who don't seem to realize that they're infatuated with an ideal that I am not and refuse to be. I keep on saying that I need a manly man. The real problem is that I have yet to find a manly man."

"event","One of my friends, Jon, came to see me this evening. He had a whole list of questions for me, two of which were boy trouble. He noticed that Jeff Green and I seem to have something going and wanted to know what was going on. The truth is that I'm kinda confused. I don't know if he just sees me as a really good friend or what. I do know that he is the kind of boyfriend that I really need. He's had other girlfriends, so it's not like I'll be a trophy for him or anything and he is very secure in himself, so I wouldn't be there merely as a self-esteem support. However, I am sick and tired of breaking up with my boyfriends. What I need is for Matt to look outside himself and realize that I'm unhappy and realize that he doesn't have feelings for me other than desperation and dump me. I'm tired of being the heart stomper in relationships. Mom jokes about me being a femme fatale, but the truth is that I have to be and I'm sick of doing it. I'm tossing it back and forth right now what I want more, to actually be single for longer than a week or a boyfriend who isn't obsessively clinging to me the entire time. I do know that I've talked more to Jeff Green in the last few weeks than my boyfriend. Jon noticed that I've been distancing myself from Matt. If he noticed that and noticed that I have a thing going for Jeff Green, then other people have too. Maybe Matt will hear the rumors, get pissed and dump me. That would be good. I heard something disturbing the other day though. Jeff had been giving me a back massage at the front desk before we left for duty rounds. As we left I heard one of the guys at the front desk ask Chaz, one of our mutual friends, if Jeff was another one of my boyfriends. I wasn't aware the school community was keeping tabs on who I've dated. I am a girl, and I do date, and I do weight less than 200 pounds, so by Rolla standards I'm elligeable, but still. I like to think of myself as a bit more than a piece of meat. Anyhoo, I'm done ranting about the woes of my life."

"event","So I'm already feeling a bit anemic today, and therefor very pissy. We had a checkin today for a group of 105. Marya and Max were the ""leads"" for this group. Marya thinks ""lead"" means ""in possession of all authority"" and was on one of her little power trips. All of us, recognizing the signs, quickly took up the opportunity to run as far and as fast away as we could, leaving her with Dana. I don't think Dana was too thrilled. We were all doing legitimate tasks, so she couldn't really complain. So this group poured in just in time for dinner to start. Dinner is for exactly one hour in the cafeteria, so Dana was rotating us so that we could go to dinner but still help with the checkin. I go to dinner, and lo, there is Matt flaming mad because the UMRPD had kicked him out of his parking spot even though he had renewed his parking permit. He ranted about it the entire time I was eating dinner, then turned to me as I was finishing up and said, ""You know, it is really amazing that the UMRPD has replaced Dr. So-and-So on my shit-list."" By this time, I was a bit fed up. Matt puts everyone of his crap list for the littlest things. Dr. So-and-So (I don't know his real name) is on the crap list because he made Matt move to another office and he is making Matt do work. Matt doesn't do anything. He sleeps until past noon everyday. At least I get up to do school work and RA work, etc. Anyhoo, my reply was no the least bit sympathetic. I said ""Well, I'm sure they had a good reason."" So that pissed him off. I really don't care right now. He gets pissed about things that are so insignificant as to not even show up on the radar of other people. I'm worrying about a checkin of over 100 people, have to deal with RAs who don't really like each other, have to deal with residents, have to worry about getting into medical school and numerous other things. And all the things I worry about are completely insignificant in comparison to other people, say, the President. While he's pissed about his damn parking space, some twelve year old is being handed an uzi and told to go shoot some people. So after all of this, Marya drags me up to her room to work on doordecs for the group that checked in. She has me doing numbering for the fifth floor. That's fine. She insisted that we go up to the 7N lounge because she thought there wouldn't be people up there, even though she now has residents. I told her this, but she said, ""There won't be people in the lounge."" Riooght. She also insisted that we take the stairs, even though she knew I wasn't feeling that well. So she dragged me up seven flights of stairs (she who never takes the stairs) and of course, there were people in the lounge, so we had to go to her room. While I sat there and did the numbers on the doordecs, she did....drumrole please....homework. Then she ordered me to go down to get the rosters with the names on them. I told her she could go do it while I ran back to my room for something. So I went back to my room and went straight back to room, where I found the door closed. I sat down on the floor and waited. And waited. And waited. I waited for a half hour. Now, there was a method to my madness. I had to start duty rounds at 7 pm. By waiting a full half hour, I got out of doing doordecs. However I was still mad at her because she wanted me to do the fifth floor doordecs, yet she sits and talks to Dana about how everyone is out to get her and lets me sit there on the floor of a half hour. Grrrrr.... I'm taking a nap before my next duty round."

(BTW, Nener, I'll be finishing Jacob's blanket whenever I can figure out how to operate Mom's sewing machine.) I was measuring out the yarn for the warp, which, for this one was 180 8ft yeards. I had put on ""SWAT"" to provide a distraction during this and Matt had joined me to watch it. He freaking hovered over the whole process and asked if he could help every five minutes. I explained to him five times that the reason I did weaving was because it was a very solitary process. I had to tell him to sit down three times. Is it impossible for him to figure out that I wanted to do it by myself? Is it so hard to understand that I like to do things by myself? ARGH!"

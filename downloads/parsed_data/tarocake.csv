<lj-cut text=""Spoilers etc"">

(+) positive stuffs >>
- Harry's thoughts were really touching at times, especially near the end of the book when the battle was raging in Hogwarts. I don't think I could have loved the series as much if dead characters did not pop up all over the place, during the final moments prior to, and during the battle.
- SHOCKING: Snapes loved Lily. (O________O) There was no way I saw this coming. In a way, it's also really shocking because he wasn't evil...!? It was easier to hate him when we thought he was, and now we're force to feel sad and sorry for him. And possibly like him too. I love being able to look back on the lives of the Marauders, and Snapes' childhood in the Pensieve.
- For some reason, after reading that, I felt like a huge chunk of the series should be Snape's as well, as much as it is Harry's. If only because he was also playing such a huge role in the background.
- HARRY HAD A KID NAME ALBUS SEVERUS. This was probably the farthest thing I could imagine. Albus. Severus.
- The Bellatrix/Mrs. Weasley battle was FANTASTIC. <3333 So much love for Mrs. Weasley. She really outshone the rest of the fighters, except for the one that followed. :D After Snape's revelation, Bellatrix became my most hated character.
- In the end, I could never hate Voldemort as much as I grew to hate Snape or Bellatrix, after book six. He had such a horrible life, and his death was so... humiliating. I have no idea why I don't, maybe because we all know that being at the top of the world is a lonely position, or something philosophical like that.
- OMG <3 Draco redeemed himself in my book. He sucked big time in books one to five, but for some reason, after seeing him scared and weak in book six, and then having to endure all that horribleness of being a Death Eater's son, and having to sit in every one of those frightening meetings.... and still having the guts to cry and hesitate when he was suppose to kill Dumbledore, made him just a little more human/wizard/normal. Children are not natural bullies afterall... (haha, ""children."" I feel old.)
- Revealing Dumbledore's past was genius. I loved how the story of his family came around again; at the start, Harry questions Dumbledore's childhood, and at the end of the book, his past is restated again to clear up Harry's worries. It also goes to show how humble Dumbledore has really become. Throughout the series, Dumbledore has been given the ""all powerful awesome"" position. But this only goes to show that he has flaws, just like any other human/wizard. Aberfoyle = owner of Hog's Head was... ""XD"" Who knew?
- Harry's chat with Dumbledore = <3  
- Reaction of everyone over Harry's pretend death = XD <3
- And of course, the Harry/Voldemort final battle. I love how Harry explained everything to Voldemort. In a way, it followed the basic storyline where everything is revealed to the other before the battle. Not only was this all a crushing blow to Voldemort's ego, but it showed how much of a hero Harry was, and how much he went through. No matter how much Ron and Hermione stuck by Harry, I knew the battle would never be over until Harry faced Voldemort by himself.
- Did I mentioned how FANTASTICALLY (sp?) AWESOME AND SPLENDID NEVILLE WAS? I half expected him to drop dead from his recklessness, but he went on to become a professor. :O <3 


(-) negative stuffs >>
- Hedwig's death was so.... simple. I thought there would be more, but it really felt like Rowling needed to wack off some characters and decided Hedgwig was easily the first. Augggh. I suppose it made sense in the end. How else were they to hide if Hedwig needed to fly around all the time?
- DOBBY (;_______;) Auuuugggghhh. Harry's burial for Dobby was so touching, and once again, his Muggle upbringing separates him from the rest of them again, for his humbleness.
- FRED (T________T) Whyyyyyyyy. The twins were the best thing about the Weasleys! Once George's ear was wacked off, the main humour just died with the series. Of course it made sense, seeing as how everything became serious almost immediately after Harry turned 17-- but still. Their humour just simple made the series a little more silly.
- The Lupin we see for the last two books seem to be so different than the Lupin we were introduced to in book three, which bothered me a lot. He was awesome, and then slowly, he was not. As much as I liked Tonks in book five, the Tonks in book six was just.... AUGGGG WHAT HAPPENED!? She changed so much, into a weeping something something. AUGGGH. I accepted that they got together, and ok, there was Teddy... but then they had to die fighting Voldemort, and leave him as an orphan!? ...WHAT?
- Peter sort of became meaningless altogether, when he strangled himself. I thought for sure, he would jump in harm's way for Harry, or something more spectacular. I guess in the end, he was always, never really special to begin with. Aside from, you know, being James and Lily's secret keeper. His 15 seconds of fame.
- CRABBE = INTELLIGENT? WTH??? That totally surprised me for... 3 minutes. It was so... odd. But Goyle stayed the bumbling side sick, which returned everything to normal for me. To have him turn on Draco was completely weird as well. If only for another minute.


(@) random comments >>
- Draco's son is name.... Scorpius. ...what?
- The detail about Draco's receding hairline was so amusing but so RANDOM. Hahahaha!! I guess that could happen if you had your bangs held back by gel your whole life. Hm. Did that come from the movie or was that always so from the first book? I wish I had the entire series to check back on these random details.
- Dudley warming up to Harry was <i>odd</i>.... but very touching in a way. I think their relationship could have been what Petunia felt towards Lily, if she lived.
- Harry's sacrifice for everyone, and thus, no one could die by Voldemort's hands... was brilliant. 


(?) confusing stuffs >>
- I had already discussed this with a friend, and I must have have read this in book six or it was suggested in book six, but I started book seven believing Harry = horcrux #7. But as I read Deathly Hallows, it seems that was not entirely the case?? The horcruxes, in no specific order:
1. Hufflepuff's cup
2. Ravenclaw's diadem
3. Slytherin's ring
4. Riddle's diary
5. Nagini
6. Slytherin's locket
7. Voldemort's own body
That made seven. But since Dumbledore suggested that Harry's body contained a part of Voldemort's soul, I became confused. Did he make 8?
- The switching of the Elder Wand reaching Draco confused me. I think this was in reference to something from book six, but I don't have the energy or time to go back to check it out right now.
</lj-cut>

As much as I have said, about disliking Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince, there is no way Deathly Hallows could have been as interesting as it was, without throwing reference to things from those two books.

- Errk. My only fear now is that I will have more to say, and spend another hundred entries writing them out.
- I tried to avoid the internet from when I heard there were leaks, up until I finished the book, two/three hours ago. XD;; Um yeah.
(edit: Ok no, that was a lie. I was on LJ looking at posts prior to the 21st. And e-mail. But otherwise... <font size=""1"">I know, I'm a freak who simply hates to be spoiled. 8D;;</font>)
- (This took way too long. I have to be up in less than 5 hours. ;;;;)

- There was an article in the papers today, about a Harry Potter academic symposia. Some of the topics they cover are so interesting... it's like an extension of <lj comm=""hp_essays"">, with fun and games. Source www.hp2007.org"

"event","I have to be the slowest reader in the HP fandom. So after delay in receiving the book because I wasn't home to pick it up Monday (T_T;; I raced the clock to get to the post office after work, Tuesday. Tonight is Thursday, and I have just reached page 196. Ah well.
<lj-cut text=""Random comments as of page 196, spoilers of course"">
I wasn't sure what to expect. I know I'm not the only one to be disappointed with Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince, because it seems like a lot of fans dropped from the fandom because of those two books. But seeing as how Rowling, who once claimed Prisoner of Azkaban to have been her favourite, now adds that Deathly Hallow has surpassed it, I'm reading in confidence that this will be better.

+ She really gets right into it, which is a far change from all the seemingly useless stuff that goes on in the previous two books.
+ For some reason, I just can't seem to find myself seeing Harry/Ginny as a good couple. Maybe if it happened earlier in the series, I could see it happening... but it's gone past the cute stage it could have once been.
+ Ron/Hermione!! I love how they finally got together here. If they became a couple too early, I think Harry's feelings would have gotten in the way of their friendship.
+ MULTI-COLOURED RAINBOW BABY CUBS! XD I couldn't help but squee at how awkward the Lupin moment was, but so cute the thought of it would be. Of course, Harry's outburst that followed kind of ruined it...
+ Kreacher did a ONE EIGHTY.... he would have been the last person/creature I expected to change his attitude. Except maybe Umbridge. But now he's so...<i>good</i>. I want a house elf. (.__.)

[Thirty-Two]
Book Title: Twilight
Author: Stephenie Meyer
Genre: Fantasy? Sci-fi?
Summary: From <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Stephenie-Meyer/dp/0316160172"">Amazon</a>, of course... ""Bella has come to the small town of Forks on the gloomy Olympic Peninsula to be with her father. At school, she wonders about a group of five remarkably beautiful teens, who sit together in the cafeteria but never eat. As she grows to know, and then love, Edward, she learns their secret. They are all rescued vampires, part of a family headed by saintly Carlisle, who has inspired them to renounce human prey."" 
I wouldn't go any further into the link, as there are spoilers, in my opinion.
Thoughts: As much as the story seem to be of Harlequin romance, or Anne Rice (although I've never read any of her books) most of the novel revolves around a kind of shy love. It's not until the readers are approaching the turn of the story, that their relationship really develops at all. And even then, it's mostly talk. Talk. Talk. Because the author is a Mormon.
<lj-cut text=""Spoilers, etc, some fangirling here and there..."">
EDWARD&hearts;&hearts;&hearts; 
<s>I have a weakness against early 20th and 19th century type characters (Mr.Darcy anyone?) in romance plots. While I think Mike, Eric, and even Tyler are great, they're true to the typical teenage boys they are. The story is fairly predictable, gorgeous angsty male character falls for beautiful weak female, turmoil ensues because they're star-crossed lovers... but it's the way it's told, with everything else around them being so *normal* (in a manner of speaking), rather than having it set in some fantastic or mysterious background, that really pulls the reader in. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's relate-able (although I suppose teenagers who read the book might beg to differ), it's unique in the normalcy that makes me want to roll my eyes, but still want to read on. 

I think I just made myself sound questionable.

Anyway. The ending is, as is the rest of the novel, quite predictable; hero saves girl, they live (for the moment) happily, until the end of the novel. There are four planned novels in this series, the third will be released Aug 7th. Backtracking a bit, although I say it's ""predictable,"" I mean it in a very general term. I say we know that the girl will be saved (happy ending story), the girl is self-sacrificing, the boy scolds girl, etc etc.... but I can't help but still like the book for the characters. I think the Cullens (minus Rosalie) are great people-- uh, vampires. I think Renee makes a very silly but caring mother, and Charlie a very awkward, but loving father. They play baseball, they have proms, everything is so <i>normal</i>. And yet, nothing is. Moving away from the cryptic talk, to me, readers can't help but fall in love with the pairings that are clearly defined. I think Bella could be better, but she'll mature. She's only 17 after all.</s>

GIVE ME A BREAK, IT'S 2 AM. (e____e) Just read the book, I don't think I can say much to do justice to the story.

Re: characters and how they look like.
The Japanese translations divided Twilight into three books, as is New Moon (book two). There are accompanying drawings to the novels (found <a href=""http://twilight.lost-star.org/"">here</a>), which brings me to my own thoughts of how the characters should look like. To me, the characters drawn here are more sharp.... Edward has eyes that are too strong, and his face is too serious. I always thought of his character as a bit more graceful, with hair that's so soft, it looks like it's just washed and dried. His face is more rounded. The rest of his family too, looks a bit rough. Dr. Cullen in the drawings reminds me of Dracula, as does Emmett. The Dr. Cullen I imagined is more angelic, probably with influence from his father being a Pastor. His hair is soft (not pulled back with wax or gel, like in the drawings). Esme, I imagined to have a head of long, soft, wavy/curly brown hair (did it say brown in the novel? I can't remember), and always wore early 20th century hair decor. Bella was not how I imagined her, but I guess it's more fitting this way.

And yes, I ship Edward/Bella. I wish I was better at creating icons but this is all I got. </lj-cut>

In the end, for me anyway, I think it's <s>the pairing</s> Edward, that makes the story more interesting than anything else."

From episode 15; if only I knew how to create a short movie clip, I wouldn't have a zillion screen shots of this scene.
Basically, Shinn comes in and asks what the heck Athrun is doing there. Lunamarie chides him for his attitude by pointing out that Athrun is now a FAITH member, and demands respect.

<lj-cut text=""The Handmaid's Tale"">[Book Sixteen]

<b>Book Title</b>: The Handmaid's Tale
<b>Author</b>: Margaret Atwood
<b>Genre</b>: Speculative Fiction
<b># of pages</b>: 320
<b>Summary</b>: The main character, Offred, is a handmaid.  In this new society, fertile women become nothing more than carrier of babies for older couple of rich and higher status.  They have no identity, only belonging to the men who own them.  I wish I would say more but the book is too complicated for me to sum up properly. Read <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Handmaids-Tale-A-Novel/dp/038549081X"">here</a>.
<b>Thoughts</b>: Throughout the book, we are slowly revealed Offred's world.  It's similar to Oryx and Crake-- [bits of spoiler concerning O&C now] we're in the present, but the past is slowly unfolded, revealing things that lead up to the present.  Reasons aren't really told, about how the current society is created, unlike in O&C.  Of course, the main characters are standing in two different positions-- Offred is only a by stander, where as Snowman was Crake's best friend.  Because Offred is not Moira, her passivity and acceptance of things annoys me as a reader.  Even though I understand where she's coming from, her personality doesn't let her stand above the rest.  Even from the beginning, we learn that Offred (who's real name we never learn) and Luke got together because they were having an affair!

All in all, a fairly ""OK"" book.  It doesn't grab my attention as well as O&C did, nor was it entertaining, but it grabs your attention enough as a dystopia.

<b>Book Title</b>: The Lives of Christopher Chant
<b>Author</b>: DWJ
<b>Genre</b>: Fantasy
<b># of pages</b>: 320
<b>Summary</b>: Really, everything you'll need to know can all be found on Amazon's web page <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lives-Christopher-Chant-Chrestomanci/dp/0001857320/ref=sr_1_11/203-7062629-9674362?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1177258829&sr=8-11"">here</a>. So why bother. :P
<b>Thoughts</b>: I was recommended this title by <lj user=""kuali""> so I checked it out. The only other Chrestomanci books I've read prior to this one was Witch Weekly (which I thought was ""meh"" at best), and Conrad's Fate (which I liked much more). I have only read a few of her books so I can't come up with a good comparison, but this was as equally enjoyable as Conrad's Fate. Millie seemed like a spoiled little rich girl until you learn about her role.

<b>Thoughts</b>: Entertaining take on the whole ""alternate universe"" view. The book is very well written, and there appears to be a lot of research done here and there-- except a lot of the references are lost on me. I was never a huge reader with classic books, and what would have been interesting cross-overs with characters of a variety of novels, were but introductions to new characters. Wonderful use of footnotes. (Although I think the best use of footnotes ever done is for Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell.)

<lj-cut text=""Lolita"">[Book Nineteen]

<b>Book Title</b>: Lolita
<b>Author</b>: Vladimir Nabokov
<b>Genre</b>: Er, I'm not quite sure. Fiction?  I've seen it tagged as Classic as well.
<b># of pages</b>: 336
<b>Summary</b>: Humbert Humbert, a middle age European man, falls in love with a 12 year old, and promptly engages in all sorts of planning to capture her for himself.
<b>Thoughts</b>: Because there were all sorts of mixed review about this book, I decided to check it out for myself.  I can honestly say that most of it went over my head.  I had to read spark notes to figure out why people thought of this book as positive as they did.  There was too many details for me, personally.  His comments constantly brought me back to the present, which I had assumed, was in a courtroom in front of a jury.  Dolores, or Lolita as he called her, was sort of a pitiable character.  He really made her out to be a seductress, which would be completely opposite of what any normal person would think, given the situation.  In addition, Humbert was given very human qualities, fears, and reaction (in general, when things were associated with Lo).  Overall, too complicated for my tiny brain to handle.  But I can see how well planned each event was, that lead up to the conclusion of this detective story.

<b>Thoughts</b>: I really enjoyed this book a lot. It was extremely well written, and you can tell the author did a lot of research before hand. It's been called the adult-version-of-Harry-Potter, but I don't see it that way. Especially since Harry Potter has turned into a book for general audience anyway. If I was to compare the two though, Harry Potter is lot more ""fantasy"" than JS&MN is. The second is more about research and history. I originally had a lot of though on this book when I first finished it (sometime in Dec I think?), but I can't remember them anymore. I just wish the film would come out soon, I'm dying to see someones interpretation on it.

""At any rate,"" interrupts Prasad, ""We were thinking that it was nice to have a book with footnotes and an appendix with a mathematical proof --""

""Yeah,"" I say uncertainly. ""Though sometimes -- in other books -- that footnote thing is a real problem.""

""How is that?"" Prasad asks before Joe can stop him.

""Well,"" I say. ""for example, I found it difficult to know what to do with footnotes in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. I mean, do you read all the text and go back to the footnotes later, or do you break the stream of narrative to read them?""

""We liked that book,"" says Prasad. ""Though it isn't heavy with narrative drive.""

""It's just heavy,"" says John. ""She coulda used an editor.""

""And then, if you do the latter,"" I go on, ""what do you do with the bookmark?""

""Bookmark?"" Jay asks.

""At least one of the footnotes was four pages long,"" I say. ""If you leave a page midway through to follow a footnote that's four pages long, where do you put the bookmark if you decide to go to sleep in the middle of reading the footnote?""

They obviously had not considered this problem, because their little faces are filled with something that looks a lot like awe. As they sit trying worry their way through my little nugget of wisdom, I watch one of the squirrels return to playing in the trees. Three-quarters of his tail are missing, perhaps chomped by some stray coyote. We call him Nub-butt.

""Actually,"" Prasad finally says. ""We're more interested in the study of magic presented as serious study, like history or science.""

""Although we would like to have seen more magical interaction with the animal kingdom,"" Jeb adds.

<b>Book Title</b>: Educating Alice 
<b>Author</b>: Alice Steinbach
<b>Genre</b>: Bibliography
<b># of pages</b>: 304
<b>Summary</b>: Each chapter is a story about a place she visited. The author has traveled to many different cities, and tried many different things.
<b>Thoughts</b>: What I like about her is the way she tries to step outside of the whole ""tourist feel"" of traveling. Rather than go with tour groups and learn what any tourist should know or visit, she takes trips around back alleys and visits ordinary homes. She tries to see the ""true"" side of each city she stays in, and not only eat up the tourist package she's fed. An entertaining book if you're bored.

<b>Thoughts</b>: I don't really have much to say about this book... but wars are bad, and I still don't understand why people should be forced into fighting. If the soldier lacks a fighting spirit, the job will only be half done (if started at all). Being a soldier is a profession, but it didn't sound like it then; rather it was more like a job forced on you when your country called it. Sadly, it seems like that kind of thing is still going on around the world... (Sorry, this isn't much though on the book itself. I'm very anti-war so that's probably why I got off-track.) Interesting read, even if I have never read any of the other books in the series.

Between the novel and the movie, I think the novel was much more detailed in getting ideas and feelings across, but the ending was more brutal. After everything fell apart, bits and pieces were being gathered at the end, and good things happened, but I guess I spoiled myself by watching the film first. It's not a bad ending, but it sort of trailed off a bit, for me. I hope my first job will be nothing like it. (O_O) Because that's just scary.

Even though it's the time for new series, instead, I went back to D.N.Angel, an old title that was never finished. Is volume 11 chapter 6 <i>really</i> the last one out there at the moment? SUCH A CLIFF HANGER. Why has it been left like this for so long...?
<lj-cut text=""Comments & random spoilers, &tc"">
I was drawn to the series at first, by the anime. The OP sounded so pretty, and I loved the way Ishida Akira played his characters. I have never been a large fan of Ishida Akira-- he's still alright, he just didn't stand out for me, as many others did-- but I became a fan of his role as Hiwatari Satoshi. For the first two or three episodes anyway. I kind of dropped it after I realized how annoyed I was, with the plot. I'm itching to go back to it again though, since there isn't anymore chapters of the manga out there.

Character Opinions & Their Relationships___
I like to see the interactions between Daisuke and Hiwatari. There is a vibrant energy in the chapters when they're together. The way they try to pretend they know nothing, and the cat-and-mouse game they play, weave together in such a way that makes things so unexpected. They know the true identity of the other, but they feign ignorance. And even after they figure it out, they still pretend to know nothing, while dropping hints and warning about their other half, once in a while. Even though the two are quite opposite, they're both great characters.
Even though I started the series thinking Dark was awesome and an amusing character, he sort of grew out of that stage, by become serious and all, with Risa. Personally, I have trouble with ""intense"" characters, and the way Risa was so focused on meeting Dark and wanting to throw herself at him, bothered me. OK, so maybe being 14 is a good excuse at being boy crazy and whatnot, but she was doing a lot of reckless things that makes me want to roll my eyes... the kind of behaviour found in crazy fangirls. Or maybe it's because of the way she treats Daisuke (wanting to drag his heart along at the beginning but keeping him as her good friend). I like Daisuke, and the way she acts only seems to support the whole ""good guys finish last"" saying. I like Riku, I think she's rather cute. She's actually smart and I like the contrast in personality she has with her sister.
Krad is so much like an empty character only filled with rage, at the start. But he kind of grew on me in ways I have no reason for, including his role as the antithesis of Dark. Near the end, when Hiwatari stayed over for the night, Krad had no intention of attacking Daisuke, and even went so far as to admit feeling envious of him. When the bad guy no longer become the bad guy anymore, it either means one of two things; one: the story is ending, or two: a newer bader bad guy is on the way. I thought it was the first one. So much for that. 

Plot___
The more that is revealed to us, the more we see that the Hikari (Krad) is not so much the bad guy. As Dark's other half, and Daisuke's good friend, Hiwatari is bound to be one of the good guys. Although, if you think about it, even Argentine doesn't seem so bad. I mean, of all the artwork created by the Hikari, Dark and Krad are the most successful, in the eyes of the spirit of the other artworks. If that make sense. What I mean is, the job of Dark is to capture artwork and have their spirits resealed (from what I gathered). Dark and Krad each have their own host bodies, and they have the freedom to ""live."" For someone like Argentine, who is suppose to be destroyed but clearly is not, becoming someone like Dark and Krad would be his goal.

2.  When he was asked if he'd like to join the ZAFT forces, the first thought that popped up in his mind was how girls loved a guy in uniform.

3.  Miriallia first experienced puppy love when she was seven.  A boy had brought her flowers from the playground, and she happily accepted them.  Without meaning to, she also broke his heart by giving her first kiss to the lucky boy who sat next to him.  The lucky boy never left her since then, until he took his seat in the SkyGrasper.

4.  Because he was a soldier first, dating was almost impossible for him.  Luckily, Dearka was flirtatious by nature and always found a date at the annual ball held by ZAFT.

5.  Miriallia hated to cook.  Although he wasn't anywhere as skillful as a culinary chef was, Dearka wasn't too bad.  Secretly, Miriallia lied because she loved the way he looked in an apron.

6.  Though he was genuinely glad his best friend found someone, Yzak couldn't help but intentionally butt in everytime they had a chance to be together.  One time, he purposely erased a phone message lefted by Miriallia.  Miriallia somehow found out.  As of present, Dearka still believes she holds some minor grudge against both his teammates.

7.  Although he was never shy about his collection of bikini claded model magazines previously, he hid them all in Athrun's cabin whenever she came by.

8.  His secret passion is dancing.  Only Miriallia knows this, because he had taken her dancing on one of their dates.

- Ueno Juri seems over enthusiastic at the start, about appearing in Bistro SMAP. XD
- Ueno truly knows how to play the piano, while Tamaki mimicked hand positions.
- Ueno goes into great detail about how she makes a natto omlette.  
- Tamaki worked part-time in a restaurant, cooking, in between acting.  For 5 years.
- Tamaki has previously, only eaten chocolate for breakfast to give himself a sugar/energy boost in the morning. As rational as that sounds... XD; (That's even worst than when I eat cake for breakfast.)
<lj-cut text=""And it goes on."">
- Ueno, who has met KimuTaku (Kimura Takuya) previously from Engine, relates a story involving Koyuki (from Petto) asking about her underwear size.  She thinks it involves receiving second hand underwear XD;; but actually, the two had spent a break rushing to a nearby lingere(sp?) store to get her a birthday present.  The others are a bit surprised about his frankness; the host (who's name I can't remember) says he would become too... excited, if he ever had to enter. XDXD
Host: By yourself?
KimuTaku: Of course!
Host: !? WHYYYYYY???
KimuTaku: ?? Why not?
He treats it like it's a completely normal thing to do.  XDXD  Personally, I find it strange that there are guys who have such confidence.  If I see a guy in a lingere shop, it is almost always the case where he is hanging around his girlfriend/wife/(female)friend/etc, or he is sitting on chairs with shopping bags, waiting patiently.
KimuTaku: NuBra (<a href=""http://www.nubra.com/"">site</a>), they aren't itchy? (Such boldness...XDXD)
It's turning into something like an ask-and-tell for KimuTaku. XD  The whole time, it must have been embarassing for Ueno.  Then the host asks her if she's wearing the mentioned pair. XD (No shame...)
- Ueno is really cute! I wasn't the only one to notice how she ""pori-pori"" often.
- The food are well prepared, the chefs really know what they're doing. Suprised me a little... :o
- Tamaki stuffs everything in his mouth, even if he can't fit it all in. He's really not like Chiaki at all. XD So cute...
- There is some tension going on between KimuTaku and Ueno, it's kind of amusing, even if he really is annoyed.  His replies are full of sarcasm towards her, but full of praises for Tamaki.
- The comment about how ""one who orders it with salt has a refined tongue"" threw me off.  Not only that I lack a refined tongue, but also that Tamaki who worked in the kitchen really knows his stuff as well, like Chiaki.
- Tamaki's reactions are so exaggerated(!?), his eyes bulges out. XD  I loved how, when they moved onto the second team, the camera really focuses on his reactions with each bite.
- Tamaki is from Nagoya.
- Near the end, when Ueno and Tamaki are to decide which team presented the best dishes, Tamaki gets up and steps back.  Ueno, on the other hand, sits there looking around while Tamaki is standing there waiting for her.  She's still a bit uncertain about what she should do next, and turns to Tamaki but realizes that he was waiting behind her. XD</lj-cut>"

The exaggerated violence in the show makes me wonder whether they used a stunt, or a large doll, or if Ueno was actually doing her best.  It looks too painful... XD

Tamaki Hiroshi is a fantastic Chiaki.  I finally watched Waterboys (not having done so, even after being continually pestered about how funny it is, for the longest time) because he played one of the characters.  His character, Sato (who goes from having an afro to being completely bald after a dumb fire accident), was completely different from Chiaki.  I was really impressed. <3333  He sings too, apparently, but I haven't bothered to check yet."

"event","It may be another spur of the moment thing, but I suddenly want to take baking classes. :9 Imagine all the pastries and desserts I could eat... I started looking for schools which cater to people with next to no knowledge about making food (and all about eating it), but then I realized how much it could cost, if I ever want to continue with it.  But still, the idea of being able to make my own desserts is so tempting.  There's no way I could ever learn from a book.  I can barely make chocolate chip cookies, although I was told shortbread is suppose to be one of the easiest... I'm getting hungry.

And I received your card, Raine!!!!!  Thank you so much! TAMAKI <3333"

I saw <a href=""http://www.wickedthemusical.com/"">Wicked, the musical</a> yesterday.  The musical is loosely based off a novel by Gregory Macguire (which I never read), but from comparisons found on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)"">Wiki</a>, the book doesn't have as good of an ending.
The plot revolves around The (Wonderful) Wizard of Oz, before Dorothy makes an entrance.  The prelude to The Wizard of Oz, explaining how everything leads up to it.  In this version, the Wicked Witch of the West doesn't start off as evil as we're lead to believe in The Wizard of Oz.  The first act is HILARIOUS.  Glinda the Good is this bubbly blond airhead, known as <i>Ga</i>linda, and due to some airheaded-mix-up-ness of Galinda, the two become roommates. The best part is when Galinda tries to do a make over for Elphaba. Galinda tries to teach her how to do a hair toss, with the flick of a wrist.  Then she tries to teach her to do it without hands. XDXD  ""Toss-toss~""
<lj-cut text=""Random clips, some spoilers"">
I found a couple of Youtube clips, and although different people played the characters in this round of the tour, the roles were just the same.  Shoshana Bean who played Elphaba in yesterday's show, was so, so good.  She had such an AMAZING voice.  The soundtrack was good too, I want to get it.

song: POPULAR
when: Galinda tries to make over Elphaba

The two are able to be so unison, even outside of the show... I guess that's why they're professionals.

"event","Normally I'd type book entries with a bunch of other ones to keep them all together and avoid over spamming, but, I can't seem to find a copy of it outside of work, and so it remains here.

One of my favourite things to do is to unexpectedly come across something good, without meaning too.  Like finding a good book when I didn't expect to.  For this, it first grabbed my attention because it has this neon bright pink cover with gold lettering.

[Book Twenty One]
Asian Values, by Nury Vittachi
Book Blurb: University students handcuff two strangers together as a sponsored prank.  The victims just have to survive being shackled together for 24 hours, and they'll raise a fortune for charity.  But this isn't easy when one is a hard-headed Asian businessman, and the other is an attractive young Western feminist...
My Blurb: Two people with different views are handcuffed together have to struggle through a day inseperable.  They have to deal with stuff that are so ordinary to us, like using the washroom or sleeping, tied to someone of the opposite sex.

Review: I laughed at all the bad luck, and it's amazing how many things the author can pack in a single day, for each character.  Davis and Licia are living and working in Hong Kong, and unknowningly, when traveling to work in a packed transit system, become strapped together because of their opposing views on the British influences of Hong Kong onto China. The first trouble they come upon is the most absurd thing ever.  Because neither of them are single, their respective girlfriend/boyfriend is going crazy over their union.  Throw in an old fashion uptight father who thinks the handcuffs are some sort of bondage fetish Davis has, and a boyfriend who thinks bondage is all the norm (except when it's with a third person), and you have a very weird story.
The ending seemed a bit rush, and things came up that I didn't expect.  Overall a good story if you were on a bored trip.</lj-cut>"

"event","I finally managed to get a day off and sort through pictures.  We took a TON, most of them scenic, to compensate for other family members not being able to join us.  Most scenic ones were taken in a moving vechicle and so, taken very poorly.  

We were sleep deprived the first couple of days.  We stayed in the main part of Edinburgh (which I found, was pronounced ""Edin-burrah"" or ""Edin-boroh,"" depending who you asked).  We were thirty second's walk away from Royal Mile, surrounded by tourist attractions and shops.  Not exactly the best place to be eating and shopping ($$), but it was very convenient, in terms of location.

It rained half the time we were there.  But the rain in Scotland isn't all that bad.  It was mainly ""spit-rain"" and not very heavy.  When it wasn't raining, it was FREEZING.  Afternoons weren't so bad, but we stayed out one evening to watch the fireworks, and my mum insisted we leave 15 minutes after the first one.  Going with my mum was nice at times, she paid for stuff.  But arguing is inevitable.  We must have had an argument or three, every day.

Overall, Edinburgh and Glasgow were much like London.  Some of the minor cities were more country-side-ish, and less like London.  Since I took too many pictures (I ran out of picture card space with two days left), I'll split them into two post.

<lj-cut text=""70+ pictures, and these are only a quarter of what we took..."">Note that I switch from past to present to past tense a lot.  Arrg.

Looking through a close. A close is basically an archway between buildings (the buildings are connected). For pictures on ""close"": <a href=""http://www.pbase.com/gwiz/image/26956880"">pbase</a> or <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/tarantulastar/120851486/"">flickr</a>.  I can't seem to find a good definition online, of what a close is.  Edinburgh seem to have a lot of them.

Some random close.

This was a little doorway found at the side of a close.  (On the left, it looks like a directory to call people, like you find in apartments.)

Museums.  I didn't visit any museums in Edinburgh-- my mum got fed up with sitting in the lobby while I walked around... but I did go to a few in Glasgow.

Jenners, a supposidly gorgeous department store parallel to London's Harrods.  (I wasn't impressed.)

You can't see it well, but it was interesting how they called a Pharmacist, a ""Chemist"".

A lot of these pictures came out really dark because it rained a lot, and the skies were cloudy... even if it doesn't look that way in this picture.  Maybe I just don't know how to use our Digi Cam. >_>

I have no idea why this came out so fuzzy.  The restaurant where the infamous JK Rowling began her script for the first Harry Potter.  She sat there quite often, due to her inability to pay for electrical heating in her home.  They even have a little sign to the right of the store, telling visitors about it.  I guess people like to grab at any chance of fame that they can.

Men in kilts.  I had to take it discretely. There were definitely more kilt-wearing men in Glasgow than Edinburgh.  I don't think I saw many outside of Glasgow.  Even the ones that I did see, in Edinburgh, wore them in tourist shops.  There's a huge story behind the history of Scotland, and how a lot of the Scottish icons today (kilts, tartan, haggis, etc) are created for the tourism industry.  I'm not kidding.  We were told most Scots don't even know that.  It's kind of sad... but I'll spare the details.  
Notice the Pizza Hut?  Scotland also had Burger Kings and McDonalds.

This was most nifty-est.  You have a wet umbrella, and you stick it into the opening at the top.  Then you pull it out, and your umbrella is covered in a plastic bag. :D  Very smart, considering how much rain Glasgow receives.

Washroom in the middle of Glasgow. XD  Thankfully, there were a lot more free washrooms in Scotland (Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, the Highlands, in general), than in London.  These were one of a few pay washrooms found in Scotland.

The Highlands >>
The majority of these are taken inside a moving tourbus. In the rain.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/scotland/DSCF0837copy.jpg"">
The tiny spots (aside from the raindrops) are sheeps.  They have many farmlands everywhere.  I mean, EVERYWHERE.

I forgot the name of this building, but it's somehow related to Braveheart.  They even have a statue of Mel Gibson playing the hero.

There's a legend about a guy who wrote a book about fairies, elves, and fawn.  He turned into a tree because he revealed secrets about them.  When a million wishes are made at the site, he will turn back into a human.  This is him/it.

Scotland in general, is very hilly.  Thus, most roads are STEEP.  STEEEEEP. STEEEEEEEEEEEP.  We had a hell of a time getting through most of the highlands.  Walking.  One lady fell while we were going down one of the hills.  This is an example of those ""safe"" roads down to the shores of Loch Lomond.

Loch Lomond. Not nearly as famous as Loch Ness, but just about.  It's suppose to be a very beautiful Loch (the Scottish word for Lake), but it rained too much that day.

The Trossachs, an area of beautiful, beautiful wilderness.

Our tourguide's hand is in the way.  So is some random person's shadow.  The story is about Roy McGregor(sp?), some legendary person.

Behind where I was standing.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/scotland/DSCF0890copy.jpg"">
To make the view even more gorgeous, the rain let up a bit, to reveal a rainbow.  The Trossachs was possibly, by far, the most beautiful place I visited.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/scotland/DSCF0883copy.jpg"">
The roads into the highlands were incredibly...scary.  They had what is known as a ""one track with passing places"" thing going on.  Basically, what it is, is one lane, with spots occasionally sticking out at the side of the road.  The one lane was not ONE WAY, but it allowed for TWO WAY driving.  So bascially, if you aren't careful while driving around a corner of a cliff, you can find yourself crashing head-on to an on coming vehicle.  Which we came very close to... pretty frequently that day.  The arrow in this picture shows one of a few ""passing point"" that exists on these one track roads.  So what happens when you find yourself head to head with another vehicle, is, the one closes to a passing point will back up, park at the side, wait until the other continues on, clearing the road, before the parked car returns to the main road, and drives on.  A bit complicated to explain.  Your really have to see how they drive to understand what I mean.

"event","Spent the rest of the weekend finishing Winter Sonata.  A reviewer said it best by calling the mini series ""bittersweet.""  Despite the recycling of the plot over and over within the series, it was overall fairly good.  It's become a classic in Korean drama.  Graphic Intensive here and there.

<p>
Kang Jun-Sang; transfer student, has a reputation for being brilliant, but lacks major social skills, has a strained relationship with his mother, and is told that his father died.  Since he was born as an illegitimate child, he always questioned who his father was.  From gathering clues, he believes that his father may not be dead after all, and transfers to Chuncheon.</p>
<p>
<p>
<p><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/cast3.jpg"" align=""right""> Jeong Yu-Jin; stereotypical friendly character with a positive and innocent outlook in life.  She first meets Jun-Sang when she accidentally falls asleep on his shoulder, on her way to school.  She wakes up when he tries to push her off.  She becomes angry he didn't wake her up until they had long pasted their stop (after she found out he would be attending the same high school).  Her natural personality brings him into her small group of friends.  She gradually falls in love with him.</p>
<p><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/cast4.jpg"" align=""left"">
<p> Kim Sang-Hyeok; childhood friend of Yu-Jin, has a one sided love and adoration for Yu-Jin, who is oblivious.  Dislikes Jun-Sang for two reasons: 1st) when Jun-Sang believes Sang-Hyeok may be his half brother, feels jealous that Sang-Hyeok may have stolen his father from him.  Because of this, Jun-Sang treats Sang-Hyeok as rival.  2nd) Jun-Sang has Yu-Jin's love, something he would never have. </p>
<p>

<p>
Oh Chae-Ri; given the label of the ""other evil woman,"" and has a friend/rival relationship with Yu-Jin.  She dislikes Yu-Jin for having grabbed the attention of the smart transfer student, when she openly admitted having ""claimed"" Jun-Sang for herself. (Pfft.) </p>
<p>

Kong Jin-Suk & Kwon Yong-Kuk; friends of the other characters.  Although they play a small part in the series, they are quite important.  Jin-Suk is one of Yu-Jin's best friends.  Jin-Suk tends to absent-mindedly slips out hurtful comments, without meaning to.  Yong-Kuk is Sang-Hyeok's other best friend.  He often acts as the comic relief to the series, but is surprisingly level headed.</p>

<center><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/scene5.jpg""></center>

Jun-Sang discovers something extremely shocking, and decides to leave Korea.  He makes one quick trip to return Yu-Jin's mittens, but dies in a car accident on the way.  10 years later... everyone is grown up.  Chae-Ri has just returned from Paris, and brings home a surprising boyfriend.  One who sends everyone back into the past.

Lee Min-Hyeong; friendly, loving, kind type of character who gets along with everyone.  His uncanny appearance to Jun-Sang (who dies in a car accidently) brings up a lot of painful memories to all the characters.  Despite appearances, he grew up in America, and has a completely different personality than the dead Jun-Sang.</p>

Despite the rave for this series, and the emotions it provokes, the plot was tiresome.  You have a girl, and an angst-sy filled guy.  Yu-Jin can be incredibly annoying and pretty evil at times.  As Sang-Hyeok's mother points out, she tends to throw Sang-Hyeok away when she can be with Min-Hyeong, but she doesn't think twice about Sang-Hyeok's feelings.  When she can't be with Min-Hyeong, she returns to Sang-Hyeok.  But she isn't completely wrong, because Sang-Hyeok is too blind to care.  Even though when he realizes this, he still accepts her back.  She is incredibly selfish.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/scene3.jpg"">
Even though they are characters to be pitied, I don't like Sang-Hyeok or Chae-Ri either.  Sang-Hyeok can be too obsessive. He says things like ""I don't care if you don't ever love me, as long as you're with me, I'll be happy"" which pisses me off.  When he realizes what he should do, if he really loved Yu-Jin, it shows him in a better light.  But even then, it's incredibly dumb because he doesn't try to move on with his life.  He is always being pulled back when Yu-Jin breaks up with Min-Hyeong.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  Chae-Ri is given the ""evil"" woman role, but she's anything but.  Yes, she lies, tricks, and throws chaos into the story, but she is one of the most honest characters as well.  Her actions are more ""normal"" than most of the other characters, because she is reacting to what is going on around her.  She adores Min-Hyeong, and it's evident when they were together.  But she still annoys me with her superior-than-thou attitude.

The plot cycles over and over again.  She meets him, she loses him in a car accident (when he found out they were possibly half siblings), they meet again (years later when he lost his memories), she loses him again (she found out they were half siblings, and he may die from a surgery), they meet again (years later when she sees his house).  They're constantly pulled together and pulled apart, it's pretty much a ""what now?"" kind of show.  Despite all this, if you cut down the series into small parts, it's not that bad.  When Yu-Jin and Jun-Sang are together, they're so adorable and sweet.  The actors played their characters incredibly well.  Yu-Jin cries too much though.  All the main characters cried too much.  But when Min-Hyeong cried, he's not ""getting in touch with his feminine-side, boo-hoo-hoo.""  He's really, truly, sad.  That probably touched me the most.  His sad face is honestly heartbreaking, which makes me admire the actor.

Favourite female character? n/a ; Male character? Min-Hyeong
m__Min-Hyeong is the kind of person that everybody wishes they were.  Good looking, friendly, attractive, and successful.  Personally, I think Min-Hyeong is one of the best characters around Korean drama.  But as the show develops, and he begins to become Jun-Sang again, his personality deteriorates.  Jun-Sang isn't a character I like as much, even though they're the same person.  He's much too moody, and sullen to be as likeable.  Although when Jun-Sang is with Yu-Jin, his softer side is much cuter, like the bit with the two snowmen.  When Min-Hyeong becomes more Jun-Sang like, he loses the cool and friendly persona.  He becomes lost, and tends to cling to Yu-Jin until it becomes annoying.  Yu-Jin clings a quite a bit as well, which probably makes them suitable in a way.  Once things settle down a bit, they are wonderful together, and don't annoy me as much.  As much as I tend to dislike Yu-Jin at times, I find their moments together to be really sweet and fluffy.  They're star-crossed lovers in a way.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/scene13.jpg"">
""Eeuuhhh..."" Female character? Min-Hyeok's mother; Male character? n/a
The base for the plot of the story lies in the love triangle SLASH childhood friendship between Yu-Jin's father (label as ""A""), Min-Hyeok's mother (B), and Sang-Hyeok's father (C).  C loves B, but B loves A, except  A doesn't love B. Ha.  So B sleeps with C, and gives birth to Jun-Sang/Min-Hyeok, except lies because she's in love with A.  If she never lied, then Jun-Sang's life would have never became complicated.  I disliked her right to the end.  She held a grudge against A her whole life, and despite her love for her son (which I still doubt anyway), she messed up BIG time.  No one should have a mother like her.  Especially not someone as kind and sweet as Min-Hyeok.  She messed up Jun-Sang, and now that Min-Hyeok is finally getting his memories back, she continues to mess up Min-Hyeok/Jun-Sang again.

Honorable Mentions, Female & Male? Kong Jin-Suk & Kwon Yong-Kuk, for above reasons.

I don't really like sad love stories.  I try to avoid them at all cost.  Even though this one was particularly sweet, it was still too repetitive and bitter.  Possibly, the only other one I might make an exception for, is Autumn's Tale, which happen to be one of the ""best"" ones as well. (And I realized I over did it with the Yu-Jin & Jun-Sang/Min-Hyeok caps but they're so sweet together...)

"event","I spent a good chunk of the weekend reading Monster by Urasawa Naoki.  The story was pretty intense and follows the life of two people, Nina and Tenma.  Since this is an older series, most people have probably read/seen it already.
<lj-cut text=""Commentaries and the such.""> 
** Probably made TONS of mistakes, too tired to check.

Tenma's character, as well as most of the other characters here, were well developed.  He started off innocent and uncorrupted, and despite everything that happened to him, he remained the same.  He performed the surgery on Johan even at the end.  Nina and Dieter are two of the characters I enjoyed reading about.  I basically read through the whole series without really having ""favourites,"" but I always wondered what happened to their trips to the Three Frogs.  Dieter carried the Tenma philosophy throughout the story.  He always managed to say the right thing at the right time.  He brought the lighter, and stronger side of Tenma into view, where Tenma cannot, because of his mission.  Nina was intelligent, but she carried a dark side to her.  Even though she was the one to have experience everything in the experiment, she was still able to live a fairly normal life, and never became what Johan was.  My guess is, Johan was able to remember Anna's suffering, and took it upon himself to avenge the past.  I read some stuff regarding Johan having a sister complex, being the older one to take it upon himself to ""take care"" of her when they were abandonned, which explained why he did what he did.  His character was suppose to be complex and mysterious, but I wish they had talked more about him.  Even though the story brought up a lot of what their past was, what happened to cause Johan to kill those people, it still felt like I know almost nothing about him!

I'm trying to figure out why I don't hate Johan as much as I should.  He was basically similar to what a mass murderer performed!  The way the people were brain washed into killing one another, the torture of the victims, and the killing of their foster parents, should normally make me hate him.  The scenes were very graphic too.  But I don't... I think one of the few reasons were:
<blockquote>1, The murders performed by Johan were almost always done outside of the reader's views.  (Except for the first one we see, the one who Tenma bought a clock for, which makes me hate him a little.)  They were already done when we reached the scene.  On the flip side, I hated every other characters (Johan's lackeys) that performed shootings within the view of the readers, like Roberto, etc.  Plus, Johan always seem to appear to have class.  A sure sign of a sociopath.
2, The readers were told really sad stories that made us pity Johan and the others, rather than anything.  The fact that they were trying to avenge their past, sort of justified it.  The bad guy got what they deserved, in a way.  Even when thousand of lives were at stake, the deaths were nothing more than nameless and faceless beings.  The more we learned, the more we felt sorry for them.
</blockquote>
The last point I made is weak, because the truth is, a lot of innocent characters were also tortured and killed.  They were given names (even if they were not their real names), and had faces and personalities, and they were trying to improve themselves.  Brown and Grimmer's death made me sad.  They were such great characters that showed immense improvements from their former days (even if we were only told of it indirectly).  I got the warm fuzzies every time I saw Grimmer.  He was a wonderful person who tried to make sure no other children suffer the same fate.  And right up to the end, he showed that he really wanted to develope from an unemotional child, to a real person with full emotions.  I didn't understand why Tenma couldn't do anything for him, when he seem to have done miracles for so many others.  Even Lunge, who I hated so much throughout most of the series, made me like him just a tad bit, at the end.  He really redeemed himself at the very end.  Yet-- I would sacrifice his death over Grimmer's any day.

What really bothers me a lot is the lack of answers.  There seems to be a lot of unanswered questions.  I suppose half of it should force me to reread the series again, but Monster is the type of series that I can't.  There's too much bloody graphic scenes in it for me to really enjoy it again.  I half expected Tenma and Nina to get together or something, but I'm really glad they didn't.  But I'm glad the series ended the way it did, sort of half hanging.  It goes with the theory that it should end sooner, than later, when it drags on too long, and people become tired of it.

For those who may not know (although I doubt that), Urasawa-sensei also created ""Another Monster"" to answer some unanswered questions lefted at the end of the series.  Mangascreener is doing translation <a href=""http://www.mangascreener.com/stephen/monster/am/amonster.html"">here</a>.

ps One thing I just thought of is that Monster seems to show a lot of ""once evil characters"" that are now common country folks. </lj-cut>"

<lj-cut text=""Fire & Hemlock, take three"">
, When Polly first funeral-crashes, she tries to take a guess at Seb's age.  How accurate a ten years old's is, I'm not certain, but Seb was assumed to be fourteen.  I'll probably have to relook that once I reread the parts where they are both at each respective school.  Near the end, Seb tries to reason with Polly over who to save; Tom was ten years or so older, and thus, has had more time to live, than Seb did.  Seeing the desperation in his position, I think it's safe to claim that he could have been rounding the number up or down.  My guess would be to round up, as the higher the number, the more pity may be invoked from Polly.  That said, the age difference between Polly and Tom couldn't be more than fourteen years.  Polly was ten when she met Tom, making him no more than twenty four years old.  When she met him again at nineteen, he was close to thirty three.  If Laurel had got to him at sixteen or seventeen, they had probably known each other for at least eight or nine years.

, I realize Mr.Piper's relationship to Mr.Lynn.  It seems that Mr.Piper's true name is actually Charles.  Charles had a brother when he was younger, named Thomas.  For some reason, Charles (or perhaps Leslie?) was the first target of Laurel.  [Maybe it was Thomas's photograph (or was it Charles's?) or something? mentioned by Charles, that set Laurel off.]  Charles, fearing for his life, or Leslie's life, made a pact with Laurel to take his brother, Thomas, instead.  She did, and must have the power to alter his memory in a way that made him believe he was orphaned.  Another suggetion is that he truly knew what was going on, but only told himself otherwise; Thomas was quite knowledgeable when Charles interrupted his final funeral procession, and said something along the lines of ""What about me?  Don't I get in this?""  Anyway, then Laurel, because she liked them musically talented, sent him off to music school.  Thomas must have kept that memory at the back of his mind, and used it to take revenge by using Leslie.  From here, this part focuses on Piper, or Charles as I will call him.  Charles, afraid for what he had done with Thomas, decides to run away(?) and start his life with the name Piper.  Leslie may have already known that he had an uncle name Tom, but grew up believing that his father may be dead.  Charles takes the place of Thomas, and thus, Leslie calls him Uncle Tom.  Uncle Tom's surname became Piper, possibly because Edna's surname was Piper; but either way, the family of Charles Lynn, his wife Edna, and Leslie becomes Uncle Tom, his sister Edna, and Edna's son, Leslie.  I wonder if Tom and Polly's visit to the hardware store started to recover his memory again.  The final trigger must be Charles himself, as he admits that he consistently stays hidden each time Tom visits.

, Somehow, Polly already has the ""knowledge"" part down, before either her or Tom realizes it.  She was able to create the truth since she first met him at the funeral, by playing Pretend.  He may or may not have already known Polly's role in his life then, depending on whether he remembers his true past.  He must have in a sense, as he insists on certain parts of the story-- like Edna's role as his sister and not wife.  Somehow, I believed that may have triggered the memories of his marriage with Laurel.  Also, I believe he must have known Polly's role as Janet, since he took her with him to choose the pictures.  He must have known about her ""powers"" in a way. </lj-cut>

"event","<lj-cut text=""A bit more on Fire & Hemlock"">From re-reading certain events in the novel, things have become a bit more clear.  A lot of analysis (found online!) concerning the ending helped imensely, because I was still very uncertain about what was happening.

, Back to Sports Day, we learn about Granny's influence on Tom.  That explains why the next time she sees Tom, he's awfully distant towards her.  And of course, bringing Mary and Leslie too (former for himself, and the latter to distract her).  ** Lost train of thought, was going to talk more about Tom/Polly's relationship but somehow swiveled to Seb/Polly. **

, I'm still not completely certain why Seb kept Polly around.  Theorists suggest it's to keep Polly away from Tom, so that Leroy stands a chance of living (Tom's death = Leroy's life).  But I think deep down, Seb truly liked her.  Polly is described to be quite pretty, with beautiful hair.  So in some ways, his actions are always swing with an underlining support for his father's life (or his own life, since he believed it has always been between Tom's life, or his own life, as a sacrifice), or his love for Polly.  Yet at the same time, he never loses his cool.  That would make the reader think Seb knew what he was doing, but at the end, Polly suggests that Seb had always been thinking of his life, and his life only.  But since Polly never really loved Seb, I don't think she understood him completely.

, When they head towards the Middleton Fairgrounds, Seb interfers, because he knows Leroy's intention to kill Polly.  He refuses to enter as well, yet he makes no further attempts to stop her from entering.  I'd like to think that this supports my thought on Seb's actions.  Seb's father doesn't know that Polly is being told to leave with him (Seb), but since Seb must love his father just the same (or if you will think of it this way, his own life), he lets Polly go on ahead.  Then Tom becomes hurt in the process, nullifying the pact he had with Laurel.  Laurel, being Laurel (as pointed out from site below), only understands and treasures rules and laws.  Therefore, that explains what happened with the whirlpool near the end of the book.  Tom was given a chance to fight for his life.

*****

I'm grabbing this theory from someone else, because I thought it explained a lot of the ending very well.

<i>Not sure where ""very end"" exactly starts, so I'll start at Hunsdon House.
Polly claims that Mr. Leroy has forfeited his right to Tom's life by
hurting Tom when trying to kill Polly.  Laurel agrees, and allows both Tom
and Mr. Leroy ""a chance"", to decide which one of them will be sacrificed.
By telling Tom he can use anything which is truly his, she tricks him into
thinking it's a question of strength.  Exactly the opposite is true, and
when he tries to use his musical talent, Polly sees that he's gone deeper
into the pool.  She realizes that the only way to win is to lose, and
deprive him of everything he's counting on helping him.  That's the reason
she says he's only used her, and that she never wants to see him again.
Depriving him of herself works, and Mr. Leroy is taken.

In the Coda, however, Polly realizes there's a way around Laurel's ""chilly
logic"".  A solution analogous to the logic problem of what happens when an
irresistable force meets an immovable object.  The answer being that both
cannot exist in the same system.  So as Polly and Tom ""can't get together
anywhere"" they should be able to get together Nowhere.  As that's not
possible for them either, the system can't be valid, as it were.
Basically, Laurel's own rules defeat her.

I think the Nowhere in which they could be together is the side of Nowhere
Polly describes as: ""the void that lay before you when you were making up
something new out of ideas no one else had quite had before.""

IIRC, in The Lion & The Unicorn article, DWJ said something along the lines
of a future for Tom and Polly being possible only if both were willing to
make continuing smaller sacrifices.  So my optimism about the ending may be
justified!  And they all lived happily ever after...

& more by the same author:

<i>Hmmm... I did say I was optimistic in thinking I understood this, right?
Ok - my take would be that there was no real reason for Tom having to win
by losing, but that Laurel set the ""contest"" up that way to ensure that Tom
_would_ lose, as she knew Tom had so much strength.  Especially compared to
Mr. Leroy.

So Polly has to reject Tom because otherwise he'll count on her love for
him, maybe?  That _is_ his, just as his musical talent is his, and that was
clearly working against him.  She can't tell him the way the contest is
rigged, as that counts as helping him, and also tips him further into the
pool.  (Not surprising that Laurel's rules are _nasty_!)

& then I thought this comment was quite detailed and well said:

<i>Leroy made himself vulnerable by violating Laurel's rules about Tom's
status-- thus he was no longer absolutely a holy sacrificial goat. Here, I
agree with Hallie.

Laurel's a nasty twister, so she sets up a contest whose result will not,
she trusts, be agreeable for Tom and Polly, regardless of its outcome. (I
think she's also exhibiting jealousy, actually.) Leroy and Tom will have a
contest of which Tom and Polly, at any rate, won't quite understand the
rules. Leroy protests his lack of strength, and Laurel states not only that
each may use anything truly theirs, but that each may use the exact
equivalent of what the other has. (Pardon-- my copy is not available, so I
can't quote.)

Leroy's strength and power have always come through Laurel, who feeds him a
strong young man periodically. So what is truly his is really Laurel. With
her on his side, he cannot lose. Tom's merely human strengths are by
comparion nothing.

Polly eventually realizes the meaning of the equivalency clause. If she
deprives Tom of herself (and he was always so sure of her), then Leroy is
deprived of Laurel. This is a sacrifice that means a great deal to her--
Laurel, on the other hand, will now simply coopt Sebastian. She does not
love, but she's a great fancier of property rights. Particularly hers.

Because Polly *does* love Tom, she gives him up entirely so that he won't be
defeated and killed. When she does so, Leroy instantly loses Laurel's
support. Then Tom's wild strength overwhelms him, and Tom is saved.

Now I'll start agreeing entirely with Hallie again. :D  After the storm, Tom
and Polly of course want to try being together. But can they do so without
violating Laurel's rules, and thus falling into her power once more? The
answer is yes and no. Because of Laurel's gift to Tom and his involving
Polly in it, they have two worlds-- the normalish empirical world and their
own world, Nowhere. Can they be together nowhere? Then they can be together
in their own world. And if they can't be together nowhere, then they can be
together somewhere.

I don't know whether their partnership will work, but I think Polly's
reasonable in thinking it's worth a try. Tom certainly took advantage of her
to use her as an anchor to save himself. But he *acknowledges* it. Your true
leech always accuses one of lack of love/generosity/whatever when its
leechly extractions are addressed, and thus passive-aggressively whines for
more. Tom didn't do that, and he also made considerable efforts to *keep*
Polly from attaching herself to him so firmly she'd have a hard time
withdrawing. He used her as little as he could, and he really liked her.

That's my take, anyway.

What I don't understand to my satisfaction is why gaining possession of
Polly will save Sebastian. It seems to me to go beyond simply keeping close
tabs on her. My speculations involve Polly's equivalence to Laurel. Or
perhaps just her having acquired some Laurel-powers collaterally through the
curse on Tom and her theft of the pictures? Surely it's not simply that
Sebastian is sure that in possessing her he'll keep her from Tom?

Ideas, anyone?

More on the whole Polly/Seb relationship...

, If Tom was meant to be pulled away from Polly's attention, why would Seb bring his name up every time he sees her?  My guess is, he wants her attention.  The only way she seems to be paying attention to him those days, was if he brought up the topic of Thomas Lynn.  Seb had the fortune of his father's stalkish ways, to find out what was going on with Tom, and thus, the information attracted her to him.  If he truly meant to keep her away from Tom, to bring up his name would be a very contradictory thing to do.  My guess is, the idea belonged mostly to Leroy, and not at all completely the same intention Seb had.

, In the UK version p. 297, when Polly wants to understand Tom's situation, Seb suggests for her to ask Tom directly.  Why would he do such a thing if he really meant to keep them apart?  Again what I mentioned in previous point.


Anyway, more later.  Full credit from here (http://suberic.net/pipermail/dwj/2000-May/subject.html) @ DWJ's ML. </lj-cut>"

"event","Have just finished reading Fire & Hemlock.  I've come to appreciate her work so much lately, because her style is so intricate and full of thought.  Her complexity in character, plot, and details are just amazing.  The only problem is wanting to read it again a second time, as soon as I just finished reading it the first time.  Too much comes crashing down at the end, and then sort of leaves you hanging like mad.
<lj-cut>Reading it once only bothers me a lot, but I'm really pinched for time until I graduate.
, not quite sure what I think about the whole Tom/Polly relationship near the end, although pulling her out from the funeral and playing pretend was really sweet.
, for some reason, I felt that Tom never really aged much through out.
, I was very confused about the end until I read site below.
, how did losing the opal caused her change in memory?
, Mr.Piper's brother...??  still felt lost about how that exchange had to do with what was going on, seeing as how Tom was the sacrifice-- unless they were somehow related?
, am rather confused about the whole incident of Polly having seen Morton and Tom when she trespassed-- were they or weren't they there?, as well as her questioning of Tom for his secrets, when Laurel was sleeping not too far away.  Am so confused.  Did his parents die, or did they not?  Was he an orphan or not?  Polly stated that she must have ""stole"" his life (in a sense), when he was really young. That sort of made me wonder about the previous point, whether he and Piper could be related.

[edit] ARGH, more thoughts running through head, can't sleep.
, Ann has distant relatives that link her back to the family which means she <i>must</i> have known about the cycle that was going on.  Somehow, Tom's choosing her as part of the quartet must be fate in that sense.
, wondering if other funeral party members are really fairies in disguise.
, I remember Seb mentioning something about his father knowing Laurel before marrying his mother, and that she was ""normal.""  From Polly, we gather that he must have known quite a bit, being a confident of Morton's.  Yet he truly did not seem to know it all-- while at the same time, hoping to catch Polly's eye.  Seb must be part fairy (unless there's not such thing, and you just become full fairy), and so, since Morton is now gone, has probably become the new ""King Fairy.""  The part that he knew about his father knowing Laurel but yet seeming innocent about Tom's past... seems to be contradictory to me.  And why would he need Polly as a ""back up?""  The riddle seem to be referring to a mortal man, and Seb is fairy, isn't he?  Polly would have done her no good, except that his relationship with her allowed her to stay away from Tom-- in a sense, although that only brought her to remember him again.


Too much thoughts.  Need to sleep.

"event","So since I told myself that I would <i>try</i> and become a better cook this year, I tried my hand at making <a href=""http://www.koreaneats.com/japchae.htm"">Japchae</a>. Hahahahahaha...haha. Ha.

<lj-cut text=""Pictures + Captions"">
It's not as hard as I thought it would be, although it still took me almost two hours. (=_=;;  There are many versions to this dish.  This was my professor's version.

Ingredients:
Dang myeon (clear vermicelli)
Beef
Minced green onion (I cheated.  My parents always have a box of chopped green onions on hand in the fridge so I used that.)
Minced garlic (I cheated on this too.  We have a small jar of pre-minced garlic)
Egg (optional-- I skipped it)
Carrot
Onion
Cooking oil
Sesame seed
Black peper
Soysauce
Sugar

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/P1010115.jpg"">
It took me about a good half hour (or more) to chop the onion and carrot.  Near the end, I was so tired, I butchered everything on the chopping board.  I never know how thick or thin to cut ingredients.  I can never remember what shrinks and what expands when it's cooked.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/P1010118.jpg"">
The beef after seasoning and stuff.  I had the beef in a smaller bowl then I realized I needed to transfer it to a bigger bowl for seasoning.  I'm an amateur, yes I know.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/P1010116copy.jpg"">
Ingredients all laid out... the kitchen is a horrid mess whenever I'm the one doing some sort of cooking or baking.  I just realized the label for Minced Garlic is too far... not that anyone cares, but it's the small bottle above the carrots.  The other jars are trailmix and nuts.  Half way through, I realized I didn't have any sesame seed so... I... sort of... improvised.  I remembered we had some sesame buns, and the sesame sort of like to shed all over the place... *insert your own conclusion*

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/P1010117.jpg"">
Close up.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/P1010119.jpg"">
I made the mistake of adding in the onions with the carrots. :x  Apparently, carrots take a long time to cook, which I didn't find out until it was too late.  Oh well.  Mushy onions are still edible.

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/P1010120.jpg"">
After I added the beef... it's so bright. *_*

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/P1010121.jpg"">
Noodles.  They were already cooked and cooled, and now I'm stirfrying it as the instructions told me.  Uh yeah, I stirfry with chopsticks... 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v50/totoromedley/P1010122.jpg"">
Um, ta...da.

Unfortunately, it was rather tasteless.  My mom said it was good this way, so we can each season it to our own tastebuds.  She's so silly... but they ate it all! XD   I think the chicken my parents bought (as a side) did the trick."

"event","I have been reading Howl's Moving Castle since this weekend, and I finished it this evening on my way home.  I haven't been doing this much leisure reading since high school.  Even though I read that the film adaptation is much different (AU-ish?), I am really looking forward to seeing Howl no Ugoku Shiro. <lj-cut>I'm not sure what most fans think of Sophie, but I like her character.  She's very pushy and grumpy, but I think her personality fit her new role very well.  She's the stereotypic grouchy old gramma, and she's not afraid to speak her mind anymore.  She admits that she says things she would never have the guts to, before she was cursed.  When I realized that maybe Sophie liked Howl in some way, I began to believe that perhaps the Witch of the Waste wasn't such a bad person.  Similar to how people had thought Howl was evil, but he really wasn't.
This is how I would have thought (although it doesn't really matter what I think) :P
- Witch ""cursed"" Sophie because she knew Sophie was bored with her life.  This new role as Old Sophie allowed her to speak her mind freely and have new adventures.
- Witch ""cursed"" Howl because of his character.  She sent Old Sophie to Howl so that he could fall in love with her, once her curse was removed.  That way, he could never hurt any girl again since Sophie would be familiar with his character.
Something silly to that extend, except of course, it turned out much better than I expected.  I like Howl, except his character is so incredibly hard to understand.  I couldn't understand some of what he was doing or saying or complaining about.  I liked Calcifer right away, and I had always believed him to be a good character.  I like Michael very much as well, except I don't have much of an opinion of him as I do of the other characters.  They never really explained how the name ""Percival"" came about either.  The romance at the end was so rushed and a bit disorganized to me, but I will definitely read it a second time.  Romance is not a big part of the book so that's understandable, although there was a lot of side romances developing around Sophie.  Flipping back a bit, I realize Wynne Jones has actually left a number of clues which will probably make reading it a second time just as enjoyable. </lj-cut>"

"event","I picked up Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception some time last week, and haven't been able to put it down (except during school).  The series always seems to end ""complete"", in a way, because I don't suspect the author to write a fourth or fifth book after I read the ending.  Apparently a movie had been in the works but still nothing has been settled.  I'm not sure if I'd want to see this on the screen, although that would be interesting.

<lj-cut text=""Spoilers, etc"">I was thinking of how Butler's relationship with Artemis really softens Artemis' character.  Butler is completely loyal to Artemis, and would give his life for him not only because it's his job (as a bodyguard), but because he also sees himself as a father/older brother role.  Although I'm not completely familiar with this theme, but isn't it kind of common in those Mafia/Triad type movies??  Where the ""younger brother"" of the Mafia/Triad look up to and has absolute loyalty for the older ones, because they're honorable and looks out for one another, despite being crooks.  In that sense, Artemis is shown to be someone worth protecting (if a person knew him as well as Butler did).

At first, I was kind of disapointed in this book because it seemed Artemis was starting to lose his superior attitude.  The author played it out well by having his memory erased in most of the book, so he was just as cheeky as he was in the first book.  His witty remarks with Opal was probably the best part, seeing as how she was becoming half insane by the middle of the book.  She was so annoying as a character, just having to read that she screaming and screeching so much.  They should have left her in Italy.

Root's death was kind of meaningless besides setting the story of revenge.  But then again, I'm always critical to deaths that I think are overall pretty useless except to set off emotions for revenge and action.  Plus, he was always a good character, although I can't exactly remember much of the first three books at the moment.  I read them at least a year or more ago.

And I loved the scene near the beginning, where Butler and Artemis played on the father-son role. XD  </lj-cut>"

"event","Lately, most of my entries sort of revolve around Fruits Basket... this being no different. <lj-cut text=""120"">From summaries, we find Kyou and Tohru still going on and on about it.  Perhaps if I had the actual chapter in my hands, I would have a bit more patience, because it seems to be dragging on and on.  Kyou and Tohru are telling their story about how ""bad and evil"" of a person they can be.  Last time, Tohru revealed how ""evil"" she was, because she hated her father.  Today, Kyou talks about how he left after Kyouko was killed.  Then he went to the mountains, to Akito, and finally found a way to rage against Yuki.  No matter which angle I see it at, I see no reason to get angry at Yuki.  The real reason I can only come up with, is because Yuki just-so-happens, to have been born before him.  Therefore, if he wasn't born, then Kyou would have been the Rat, been revered, etc etc.  My guess is, when Kyou can come to terms with the fact that it isn't Yuki's fault (bringing it full circle in a way, because Yuki was first to talk about not putting the blame on others, but forgiving them kind of thing), then the story will start to end.  So Kyou places the anger he holds for his mother's death, his father's actions, his mis-treatment as the cat, his ""moster"" half, all of it, over the fact that he was born after Yuki.  Add to when he put his own life ahead of Kyouko's, causing her death, and then his agreement with Akito about beating Yuki before graduation, he has a LOAD of anger against Yuki.  Which makes you wonder what Yuki has been thinking the whole time.  I mean, ever since he was young, Yuki had thought Kyou was kind of neat, with his orange hair.  Then he meets the guy, and finds out the cat hates him.  That must be what he believes, even til now.  Anyway, I'm side-tracking.  What I would like to happen is for Kyou and Tohru to <i>finally</i> get together.  I can see Yuki as being the one to bring them together, which would probably piss Kyou off.  As for the cliff hanger, Takaya-sensei is one evil, evil person.  I can't see Tohru dying, but I can't see Tohru preaching to Akito as she could with the other Juunishi members.

[edit] Regarding the whole Kyou-angsty-versus-Yuki thing, I've calmed down quite a bit. :PPPP  Because after reading more on the recent chapters, Kyou clearly feels hurt and ashamed of what he's done.  He obviously loves Tohru, but feels that he shouldn't deserve any love, after what he's done.  He's been trambled on quite frequently, because of who he is in the Juunishi.  He must have been told many times, that he doesn't deserve anything, because he's a monster.  And because of those thoughts, he must hate himself more than anything, for not being able to save someone because he's a ""monster"".  Towards the one person he couldn't care more about, no less.  Especially after finding out that he's always wanted to meet Tohru in person, and then pretending he's never met her.  But still... to turn that all around and put it towards hating Yuki, is kind of harsh.  Even if he believed that Yuki was a spoiled Rat, when he didn't know the truth.  At least he never caused his mother to kill herself.  No child should have to go through that.  I hate to say I pity Kyou, because that doesn't really express what I'm feeling.  He's got Shishou, and at least Kagura and Haru don't seem to regard him as badly.  But it's still kind of sad about what he had to keep secret.  Being in presence of Tohru everyday must have eaten him inside.  When she was a stranger, it was hard for him considering he had to go to the mountains as a self punishment.  When he grew to love her, it must have really hurt...

I was looking back on previous chapters of Furuba, somewhere in Volume 3, when Tohru-tachi visited her mother's shrine and had a party.  Takaya-sensei REALLY knew what she was doing from page 1.  No wonder Kyou questioned Hanajima about ghost vibes, and having to apologize to her at the end of the chapter. [/edit]

I've been thinking of getting a laptop sometime next year before I go away, and I had eyed Macs for quite some time now.  But working on the school Macs is such a pain, I'm wondering if Macs are really the right brand I should be looking at.

"event","More Fruits Basket babble.  Now that I've finally gotten to 119, it still seems like the series may go on for another 6 months.  From 110 on or so, I've been following summaries.  Most of this may not be perfectly accurate, only what I gather from those summaries.  <lj-cut text=""Speculations on being freed."">Kureno, Momiji, and Hiro.  I read somewhere that Hatsuharu may be next in line since it seems to be a ""trend"", although I haven't got the slightest clue what this ""trend"" is.  But there must be something they've got in common, something they've finally reached or figured out, or something to do with their relationship with Akito.  Kureno was the first one.  Unfortunately, we're still not really sure what happened (and apparently, neither does he) around the time when he was freed.  Moving on, Momiji was the next freed.  Was there any particular reason?  Momiji's personality couldn't be more different from Kureno's at first, until I thought perhaps it was somehow related to their interaction with others.  Kureno is the type to sacrifice himself.  He wants to remain by Akito's side because it calms her, and defines her role as ""God"".  Momiji understands sacrifice at a young age.  He forgives and lets go any ill feeling he has towards his parents for what happened.  Hiro as well, would do anything for Kisa.  He mistakenly told Akito about his love for Kisa, before he realized his mistake.  But still, I don't really see this as a trait necessary to free them.  Otherwise, I should think Hatori should have been freed first, seeing how much he gave up.

Seeing as how little Kureno shows up, focus is on Momiji and Hiro.  As the story continues, Hiro learns how to ""become an adult"".  He still finds Tohru annoying for hogging Kisa's attention and love.  But he's learn to accept it, because he Kisa loves Tohru, and he loves Kisa.  He's no longer the brat we were introduced to, but he's really become someone closer to being called ""Kisa's Prince"" these days.  You always see the two of them together in these more recent chapters.  Where there's Kisa, there's bound to be Hiro.  As for Momiji, I'm trying to recall what it is about him.  What changes has he gone through??  He was this <b>adorable</b> little boy, who loved to hug Tohru because she was sweet and kind, and knew about their secret.  He took advantage of that from day one.  We learn that he likes to edge Kyou on, about his relationship with Tohru.  That kind of bothered me a bit, because while he seem to encourage KyoRu, he was also jumping her for hugs as well.  Only do we realize later on, that Momiji has fallen for Tohru as well.  I'm slightly inclined to become a fan to encourage this relationship, because of how he stood up for Tohru in front of Akito.  But we all know Kyou and Tohru already feel the same towards each other.  This was perhaps Momiji's change.  Physically, he matured to become more ""eligible"" for Tohru. (More towards mature/ grown up/ teenage years versus being cute/ child-like.)  As well, he may have also realized that he was actually in love with her about this time.  That it was not OK to jump/hug her anymore (he was bigger than her now), and that he could possibly feel embarass about it because he thought of Tohru as more than simply an Oneechan.

If that was the case, shouldn't Yuki have been freed as well??  Clearly, he has matured and grown a lot more than either of these two.  He's learned of what his ""love"" for Tohru was, he learned to stand up to Akito, he has somewhat more respect for Kyou these days, he's made natural friends (not due to popularity), he's slowly accepting his brother and his mother as well, and he's actually making an effort to know more people honestly.  He should have been freed AGES ago.  Which leads me to ask, why are the other members still bound to Akito?

Yuki, Shigure, Kagura, Haru, Rin, Kisa, Ritsu, Hatori, Ayame, and Kyou.  From what I can vagely remember, Shigure, Haru, Hatori, and Ayame are still more or less the same as they were from when we were introduced to the characters.  Shigure stayed the same, only that we're shown more of his cruel side as the story developed.  Haru seem not to have changed much either, rather he was the one instigating change on Rin.  Hatori and Ayame also stayed the same, except Ayame has managed to become closer to Yuki.  Kagura realized why she ""loved"" Kyou, and how she truly loves him now.  She hasn't really changed much either, besides the revelation.  Rin made big changes, but that that pertained more to her attitude towards Tohru, as well as finding a place to call ""home"".  Kisa found her voice again, and Ritsu is still the cross dressing shy monkey.  Kyou has kept the surly attitude he's always had, but he's always been nice to Tohru as well.  Thinking back to the first time they sat on the roof together, while they practiced punches, he had always enjoyed their company.  Of course he's developed in many ways such as learning to accept some things, but still find other characteristics of himself, disturbing.  But slowly, with Tohru (and Shishou, and even Yuki) by his side, he will overcome a lot of them, as he has already done.  I think this is probably what made me think about ""Accepting yourself"" as a possible ""curse-releas<i>er</i>"" for Kyou.  Once he's learned to accept who he is, and what he is, I think he will be able to change.  At least, that's what I'm speculating.

Or it could be because they're all gathered at once for the first time in forever (or never?) as revealed by Kureno, that it was ""time"".
Or maybe their blood link was thining and somehow, the bird's was to go first.  I thought it was kind of funny how Kureno mentioned that the animal forms were becoming more silly or something, giving Hatori's seahorse form as an example. 

A few other things I thought was interesting.  Akito believed that everything went wrong when Kureno became freed.  If he hadn't been so kind hearted, then Akito would not expect that from everyone else.  Because as soon as Momiji was freed, Akito scrambled her way to try and convince him to stay.  I didn't see the chapter my self, but I don't think he even bothered to find out what happened to Hiro, even if he felt it.  Which made me think, of course he doesn't even care about anyone else, only that they exist to define her role as God.  They could be locked up in a cage (Rin) and she still couldn't care less, because they only existed as a bond to her.  Which made me wonder whether she intended to target women members solely because they were female, and she's also female.  First, she wanted them to all love her, and adore her.  Kisa stole Hiro's heart.  Even though she had no clue, she ""deserved it"" in Akito's mind, because she caused Hiro to stray away from the ""true love"" (for God) he should display. (XD That made me laugh as I typed it, that Akito is so delusional.)  In this case, I wonder why she didn't just slapped Hiro around instead.  Maybe because he's too young?  Maybe he thought of Kisa the same way he thought of Rin, that she was seductive and all that stuff.  Rin, I can see why, Kisa... again, Akito's not exactly right in the head.  Between Rin and Haru, since Rin was right there when she confessed it, why not throw her out the window?  Besides, the idea of having all the guys love Akito dearly should be more heartwarming and all that stuff, than having a bunch of girls wanting to stay close to her forever.  Afterall, the way she tried to force Kureno to stay with her was through sex.  Which made me realize how Hiro must have felt when he saw Rin being pushed through the window.  After realizing how his confession had hurt Rin, he must have felt some sort of attachment to her.  Which kind of explains why he never really got the same response from Rin.  It might have been some sort of feeling, regret and anger, that he was hiding from Kisa but wanting to express it.  As for Kana and Hatori, Kana was out of the loop, so she was sort of ""forbiddened"" for Akito.  And it would be unforgivable, unlike her treatment within the inner circle.  Within the 13 zodiac members, she had absolute control, and they were her's.  Therefore, he had to hurt Hatori, to ""teach him a lesson"".  Does she favor Hatori less than she does the other male 12shi members because she hurt him?  I doubt it.  Besides Shigure, the others blindly follow her and obey her every command.  [editx1] Which makes me wonder, does Shigure actually care about being freed?  He may want to be bound to Akito forever... And I then I can't help but wonder how Mabudachi Trio, Kureno, Ritsu, the group who are older than Akito (but especially the first two mentioned), felt about the change from their God being Akira, to Akito.  I mean was there any physical changes, or was it all mental?

'From volume 10 - author's note on Mayu-sensei:
<i>""She might be the type who's kind of sad that she's a woman. That might be why Shigure likes her. Poor thing...""</i>'

And her displacement of Akito to Ren as well, during more recent chapters, may explain just how loyal he really is.  If Kureno had not been freed, Akito may have gotten close to Shigure and everything may have turned out normal.  But then we'd have no story.  And another point I sudden remembered.  If Akito believed everything went ""wrong"" at that point, why was she so cruel to Yuki even as a child?  Was this point still early on, before she had met any of the other 12shi?  Or was she just a cruel person deep inside, from how Ren and the others treated her, and expected of others?  Because she appeared to be a lovely child, when she stood by Akira.

It was rather symbolic and significant, that Arisa had to see dead birds, around the time Kureno was stabbed.  I have half heartedly hoped Arisa would turn around the corner to see Kureno's fall.
</lj-cut>

I really need to find a good furuba discussion board to see what others' theories are.  I talk too much for my own good.  The Yahoo!ML isn't too bad, but there's also quite a bit to filter through, if I really want more interesting stuff.

[editx2] >:O! I just saw some HiroHinata <3 icons.  The compiled volumes need to come out soon, because I realllllly want to see the pictures."

They have a ton of organic foods easily accessible, and their food generally appeared to be of the healthy type.  Aside from the greasy fast food dishes, but even McDonald offered organic milk."

You can imagine what happened here. </lj-cut>

Ever heard of Sambakza??  As weird as a pairing of a cat and a bunny is, the song is actually quite catchy.  They made this really cute FLASH animation, so I took some more caps. >.>; <lj-cut text=""There She Is"">

Bunny falls in love with Cat at first sight.  I think the drink's spiked.  Or something.

So Bunny chases after Cat, and we see odd clips of Bunny displaying... forms of... affection?

She's scary.

She's crushing him with her love balloons.  They just float out of her...

He tries to explain to her, Cat + Bunny = NOT Cat&Bunny but...

...she's really clueless. XD

XDXD  Cat introduces to Bunny some handsome available bunnies.  She actually scares them away.

Her fantasy...

...his nightmare. XD

He gives up~! XDXD</lj-cut>

There's even a <a href=""http://voxifera.net/gottya/index.php"">fanlisting</a>. XD A sequel follows 'There She Is' but I'm too lazy to do more caps.  The official site is www.sambakza.com but it doen't always seem to load.  Clips are available by googling 'sambakza', or by visiting fanlisting."

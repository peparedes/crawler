Your type is known as the teacher, or the educating mentor. You also
belong to the larger group, called idealists. You tend to bring out the
best in other people. You lead without seeming to do so. People are
naturally drawn to you. You expect the very best from people which
takes the form of enthusiastic encouragement which is so charming that
people try their best not to disappoint you. You share your personality
type with 3% of the population.<br>
You need to feel a deep and meaningful connection to your romantic
partners, and go to great lengths to understand and please your mate.
Harmony is vitally important to you, and you often put others' needs
before your own. You have a pretty thin skin and are easily hurt.
Although you strive for harmony, when your values or ethics are
violated, you can be very emotional, confrontational, and even
punishing. However, you are very insightful about the underlying cause
of conflicts, and an excellent communicator, so you have the tools to
bring about a quick and peaceful resolution as long as you can keep
control of your facilities. You want to be appreciated for your
thoughtfulness and compassion. You need your partner to make a real
effort to get to know you. Above all, you need to be able to express
your feelings and have them taken seriously.<br>

It's a good thing, because the neighbors can't deny that they were being loud, or that they were fighting.  The officers snuck up to the door ninja-style, and they heard a good bit of it first hand.

I hope they were cited for disturbing the peace.  I'm a little worried that there will be a backlash, but as Heather said, we'll just call the police again, and keep doing it until they stop being so obnoxious."

"event","I got up at ten o'clock this morning, which is quite early for me.  I don't like sleeping in until noon, but until I get a day job, I'll probably continue to sleep late.

Eric and I went to breakfast at Village Inn this morning, which was very good, as always.  I told him about the time Isaac bought a platinum wedding band on Ebay, and was wearing it so women wouldn't hit on him (or so he claimed).  This got me thinking...  I should borrow my sister's iPod, and use it to record the various things that happen during the day.  Then I could just put links to the clips in my journal.  I don't know if the iTalk is good enough to handle recording conversations, considering that it is designed for voice memos, but it'd be funny if I could get it to work.

After breakfast, we walked to work.  Heather was getting off work about half an hour before Eric started, so it worked out well for me.  I cashed my paycheck and made sure I had my schedule.

Heather and I went to Lloyd Center to shop.  We had actually intended to just browse, or shop clearance, but while we were there, we picked up a pretty good digital camera.  We did a lot of comparison shopping, so it took a while, but the one we chose is much better than the crappy one we had with the really slow shutter speed and massive delay.  I'm hoping we can actually take pictures with it and have them turn out.

After that, we went to Marshall's to shop their clearance racks (told you that's what we intended to do).  I bought four very cute shirts for $24.  Woohoo!  I should have thought of shopping clearance at liquidation stores earlier.

We saw Ian (my sister's ex) at the transit center on our way home.  He hid his face from us as though he was hoping we wouldn't see him, even though we were both staring directly at him.  It's interesting, because he always acted like such a macho prick...

All this running around has given me a nice sunburn.  For the most part, I don't wear sunscreen, because I need to get enough sun exposure to prevent cancer.  I try to be aware of how long I've been in the sun, and go inside if I've been out too long.  Today, however, I wasn't paying attention, and I got pretty burned.  I have a pain relieving gel that is supposed to moisturize, but I don't know how well alcohol does at moisturizing the skin.  I have my doubts."

I've been working a lot lately.  40 hours a week, which is about the maximum my manager can give me, without sending me into overtime.  This week, I actually get two days off in a row.  I know this is probably unintentional, because our schedules are written for one week at a time, Sunday through Saturday.  Well, this week, I have Saturday off, and next week, I have Sunday off.  Woohoo!  It's even a whole weekend off!

Heather and I have been looking into buying and selling on Ebay.  If done right, it could be a great supplement to our current income.  We're going to start with DVD's, because it doesn't require any specialized knowledge.  We've found places that sell them for as little as $1 each, and we could probably haggle to get it lower.  We may eventually do other things as well, but it depends on whether we like the work.

I woke up today with my face swollen, and a headache.  Heather gave me Loratadine, which made me a little drowsy, but that may also be caused by the lack of sleep.

Heather, Eric, and I went to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Contrary to the negative reviews about Johnny Dep as Willy Wonka, the movie was great fun, and I loved him in the role.  I think that much of the humor was probably not meant for children, which the critics may not have liked.

After the movie, I went to work.  I thought I worked at 5:00pm, but I was actually scheduled at 5:30pm.  Nevertheless, Rachel called back to the break room a little bit after 5:00, and asked me to start work early.  I was checking, but it wasn't as boring as usual.  I've been so sleepy, it didn't really bother me.

I just got off work, and now I'm home.  It's still pretty hot outside, and there's a thunderstorm to the west.  I was hoping it would go over us, so things would cool down, but I suspect it won't."

We came back to my apartment and watched TV for a while before Eric had to go to work.  He forgot his cell phone at my place, so we stopped by work to drop it off for him.

We went to see Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  It was entertaining to watch, but very predictable.  I could've written the plot, myself.  It was that obvious.  The premise of the movie is that you have a married couple who've been together five or six years, and they're having marriage problems.  Why?  Well, both of them are professional hitters, and are trying to hide it from each other.  They each eventually find out who the other one is, and start to try to kill each other.  It's a typical love story, so you can guess where it goes from there.

There was quite a bit of action in the film.  There were lots of gunfights, and buildings blowing up, and one scene of extreme domestic violence.  All in all, I'd say go see it for the action, not the plot.

Anyway, back to my freaky Neopets thing."

Before work, I ate at Olive Garden with Eric and Heather.  Good company makes for good fun.  We mostly joked around, although I seem to remember discussing Heather's flat tire on her brand new bike.

I worked in USCAN with London for the first time, which was interesting.  He's extremely sarcastic, and I get the feeling he doesn't like customers too much.  He told me about an 82 year old woman he once caught stealing expensive cosmetics.  He said that security didn't do anything about it, and it was frustrating, because if she'd been 16, they would've arrested her.  I think this is especially interesting, because surveys have shown the major demographic of shoplifters to be older women.  I think it's often assumed that if a 16 year old has expensive, unpaid merchandise in her purse, it's intentional, but if she's 82, it's a mistake.

On another note, where I work, ice and rice are on the same aisle, but the sign above the aisle doesn't mention the ice.  Kelly wants management to scrape the 'r' off of the sign, so it says ice.  I told London about that, and he said that some day, when she thinks no one is paying attention, I'm going to see her shimmying up the pole to scrape the 'r' off herself.  I spent a good portion of my night imagining Kelly shimmying up a pole, and laughing my ass off about it.

I saw Che, tonight.  I was tempted to ask him if he was happy, but I refrained.  I also saw a customer digging through our garbage cans, and I bit back the urge to ask him if he was finding everything he was looking for."

Actually, I did spend a little bit of quality time with my dad, watching a TV special on Ebay.  He's addicted to Ebay, but I won't go near it.  I've used it a few times, and with one exception, was screwed over every single time.

I worked a short 4.25 hour shift, today.  Checking, of course.  It wasn't as bad as usual, because there weren't very many customers, and there were quite a few of my coworkers about.  I spent a good portion of my day chatting with coworkers, and doing tasks that weren't related to checking.

I close, tomorrow.  I think it'll be a USCAN shift, since Wes isn't working, and there isn't anyone else jumping at the chance to close USCAN.  There are actually very few people who like running USCAN.  I guess I'm an odd duck."

When I got to work, Diane, the teller, told me that Wes needed to be taken out and beaten with a stick for the way he closed last night.  I volunteered.  I said that it was clearly my responsibility, since I trained him.

Kelly was written up for ""missing tender"", today.  The manager said that since she made a cash drop without notifying her supervisor, it was her fault that it wasn't entered into the computer.  This is nonsense, because the supervisor isn't always around, and Kelly put all of the information in the log, which is about the extent of her duties.  She wrote ""under protest"" where she was supposed to write her name, and I suggested that if we were to be responsible for whether the information is entered into the computer, we should be given access to the computer and allowed to do it ourselves.  Of course, they'll never let that happen, because they don't trust us with access to that system.

On to the more exciting aspects of my day...  About half way through my shift, a lady riding in an electric cart ran over a display of ice cream toppings, causing the glass jars to tumble down, and making a mess of glass and sugary syrups all over the floor.<sup>1</sup>  Kelly was standing nearby when it happened, and the lady told her that she had barely tapped it.<sup>2</sup>  Then, the lady went up to the benches behind USCAN, and laid down on them, claiming that she had been injured.  Kelly called Pieter, the food PIC, and he went to talk to her.  I don't know what happened after that, because I had to go to lunch.  I know that she got $20 and a free umbrella out of it, and the store director will be calling a corporate lawyer on Monday to get a heads up, because she'll probably sue.  I also know that there were enough witnesses that Fred Meyer will win if she sues, and we'll probably be able to eighty-six her.

Pieter didn't have a chance tonight.  A couple of hours after the lady in the electric cart left, some guy tried to steal beer.  When Pieter confronted him, the guy hit him with the case of beer, and ran.  Of course, half a dozen people chased after him, and they caught him in the parking lot and sent his ass to jail.  He managed to assault the security guard before they took him away, so he'll be spending some quality time behind bars.

I was talking to Jen about the situation, and told her about the incident a month ago, where a customer hit me when I was working in USCAN.  As soon as she hit me, the lady took off for the door.  I didn't file a report or anything, because security wasn't there, and I was told that once they leave the property, there's nothing we can do.  Jen suggested that next time I at least file an incident report.  They probably wouldn't catch her, but the evidence is recorded on cameras, and my employer is responsible for keeping my working environment safe.

I'm not working tomorrow, and I have no plans.  How boring is that?

"event","I think I have a stye building up under my left eye.  This means I can't wear makeup until it goes down.  In fact, I should probably throw all of my makeup away, to make sure I don't make the infection spread or get worse.

I worked the closing shift, today.  Yesterday, really, but I haven't gone to bed yet, so it doesn't count.

I ended up riding the same bus as Wes, my coworker, on my way to work this afternoon.  It was about 20 minutes late, which was fine, because I left early so I could get something to eat before I had to clock in.  Wes bitched about the late bus, and the slow driver during the entire trip.  When we got off the bus, he yelled, ""WAY TO BE ON TIME!""

What an ass!  It's not like he was late to work (which he doesn't seem to care about any other day).  If he was <i>really</i> bothered by it, he could have said something to the driver, rather than shouting about it over his shoulder as he ran the other way.

Luckily, he didn't go home tonight, so I didn't have to ride the bus back home with him.

I was the closing head cashier tonight, which means I was checking all evening.  And yes, I'm bitter.

On to a more cheerful topic:

My sister suggested that I explain who Dane is, in case someone who doesn't know me stumbles onto my journal and happens to care.  We wouldn't want anyone to be left wondering, so I shall give a brief history of Dane and me...

Dane and I are coworkers.  He started working at Fred Meyer about two months before I did.  When I started working there, he often called me on the checkstand phone to tell me the latest gossip.  I figured that if I ever wanted to spread a rumor, I could tell Dane, and everyone would know about it within an hour.

I noticed that whenever I talked to Dane, he would start laughing for no apparent reason.  I'd ask him what was funny, but he wouldn't tell me.  I just decided he was being Mr. Socially Inappropriate, and practiced ignoring it.

About a year after I started working there, my boss hired someone named Laura.  She and I eventually worked on USCAN together, which gave us ample time to chitchat.  Eventually, she said, ""You know Dane has a crush on you, right?""

""Really?""  (I had no clue)

""Yeah.  He talks about you constantly, and every time he makes a joke, he uses your name as a punchline.""

""What kind of jokes does he tell?""

""You don't want to know.""

Okay, now I really don't want to know.  But it gets wierder.  I talked with Laura about the whole Dane/crush issue, and told her I definitely wasn't interested.  She took matters into her own hands, and told him that she probably had a better chance of getting a date with me than he did.  

After that, he started calling me on my checkstand phone, and hanging up (repeatedly).  He took apart the keyboard on one of the checkstands to graphiti my name on the keys.  He started signing work related documents ""Orangeberry"", which is an ""artistic"" version of my last name.

He got in trouble for using a fake name when signing work related documents, and management put out a notice that there was to be no graphiti in the checkstands.  His hours have also been cut down to 12 per week, so I almost never see him."

"event","Today, I was supposed to work at 10:30am, but I traded shifts with a coworker, so I could work the 1pm-7pm shift.  It was your standard checking shift, so I didn't have very many memorable customers.  I made a deal with Rachel that if the checkstands stayed busy, I'd stay until 7:30.  Almost immediately after making this agreement, I decided I definitely didn't want to stay half an hour late.  I think I beat my old productivity record just to get out of it.

After work, I went to dinner with my dad.  He told me he thinks I should date Dane.  Bahahahahahaha!

Me:  Definitely not!
Dad:  Why not?
Me:  I don't want to talk about it.
Dad:  Well, at least he's a nice guy.

Anyway, my dad is still working 14 hours a day, and I can't understand what he's killing himself for.  I can't talk him out of it, though."

We saw Batman Begins on the 4th.  I liked it as a character plot, but then, I like most super-hero/comic movies."

"event","I'd have written in my journal before I went to bed last night, but when I got home, I was too tired.  At least now I have a better sense of humor about things.

I worked in USCAN last night, and it was a long, mind-numbing stream of people who refused to do what I told them to, and then got angry when the robot didn't work.  It didn't help that I was tired, and didn't have much patience with these people.  I get especially irritated with people who push the ""help"" button, and then argue with me when I try to help them.  ""Fine.  Do whatever you want.""

A few minutes ago, I went over to my neighbor's apartment to feed his cats.  He wanted me to do it twice, today, but there isn't enough cat food for that.  In fact, I was only able to fill their bowls about half way.  I'd feel bad if they had to go hungry, so I might buy a little bit of cat food for them."

"event","Another day, another dollar.  That's what they tell me, anyway.  Since it's the weekend before Independence Day, it's been relatively busy.  I pulled in $25,000 through USCAN, which actually isn't all that much, considering it's a friday night.  Customers still managed to keep me hopping most of the night.

My assistant manager was the closer, and will be closing tomorrow night as well.  I'd much rather close with Rachel, but Fred Meyer makes all the bigwigs close during holiday weekends.

My neighbor is going out of town for a couple of days, and asked me to feed his cats.  We aren't actually supposed to have cats in our complex, but apparently nobody listens to that rule except Heather and me.  My only big concern is that one of his cats might get out.  Sirus is stupid, and would be easy to coax back in, but Squee would just run off.  I'll just have to make sure I'm careful, and hope for the best."

"event","Okay, I just set up this Livejournal account (obviously).  I'm not used to writing in such a public forum, and this should be interesting, to say the least.  The setup was rather time consuming, but it's easier than setting up a Yahoo! group for the same purpose.

So, a day in the life...  Today was my day off, so when I woke up this afternoon, I goofed off for a while.  That got boring after a couple of hours, so Heather and I went to the bank to deposit rent.  It seems that I can no longer access my bank account online, because I can't remember the four digit passcode that I set it up with when I signed up with online banking a couple of years ago.  They need me to put it in for unspecified security reasons (even though they've never needed it before).

After we went to the bank, I bought an inhaler, and stopped by Taco Bell for lunch (breakfast, really, but it was four in the afternoon).  Then I went back home and filled out a budget worksheet.  Lo!  I have over $600 after bills every month, just to play with.  I'm sure I've always had this much money to play with, but I tend to piss it away on movies, and video games, and eating out.

Long story short, I bought a new computer.  It's a Mac Mini, and it's so much faster than my old computer, I can hardly contain myself.  I haven't even had a chance to play with all the neat features, but I'm still pretty excited.  I'm also happy with the fact that it's very small, and I can fit it on my makeshift desk, rather than cramming it underneath and fighting it for leg room."

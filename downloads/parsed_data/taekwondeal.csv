"event","&nbsp;&quot;<i>Banjo Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts</i>&nbsp;was Rare's third idea in their plans to create a sequel to&nbsp;<i>Banjo-Tooie</i>. In an interview with Gregg Mayles, he said that the first idea was to create a remake of&nbsp;<i>Banjo-Kazooie</i>&nbsp;that would purport to be a direct port, but would feature extreme changes unexpectedly. For example, a massive queen termite would emerge from the termite hill in Mumbo's Mountain, causing Banjo to have to get oranges for Conga to throw at it. The second concept involved more traditional platforming, but with Gruntilda trying to follow Banjo and Kazooie around every world and replicating their moves in an effort to better them.&quot;<br /><br /><br type=""_moz"" />WHO&nbsp;thought that a racing game would be better than those first two ideas and why did anybody listen to him?"

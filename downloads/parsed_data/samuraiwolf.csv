"event","Six years ago, I made a deal with a good friend of mine. The deal involved a battle of sorts (which many of those who read this would find typical, knowing me), that turned out to be much more complex than I ever thought possible. Despite the ever - changing time and rules, in the end I got exactly what I came for; a symbol of honor that can never be erased. Six years to earn: a lifetime to deserve.

The mark has been made."

"event","Here's the situation; I decided to finally acquire formal training in martial arts. I visited a dojo that taught Jujutsu and went through a three - lesson trial procedure. By the end of the first lesson, I was humiliated by the sensei of the dojo and came to lean that a choke hold administered from someone who has dedicated his entire life to his art (considering that he was born and raised in Japan), is enough to make the lymph node in the right side of your neck swell up to such an extent that it becomes painful to breathe; let alone smoke, eat, or turn your head. The irony of this is that I may return to that same dojo if I can find the means to afford six months worth of training.
     After this, my job began hammering down on me. My current levels of stress and depression are through the roof, and very little (if any) logical thought or advice has come to me on account of it all. 
     Finally, I was forced to say goodbye to someone who once called himself a friend after he betrayed me by breaking his word. Despite the all - too - familiar pain that betrayal brings, it stings much more when you helped the betrayer to get to where he or she is in life; only so that they can spit in your face.
     After a period of contemplation, I have come to realize that there are very few people who even read the things that I have written here; and of those people, even fewer of them actually gain any sort of insight from any of this: at the most, a slight laugh or two is all that any of what I have said here is worth. Bearing this in mind, I came to ask myself ""Why should I continue to write anything if no one seems to truly understand what I have written? Why should I waste my time in trying to communicate anything if no one can take anything with them from it?"". The answer to these questions is simply ""I should not"". I should not waste my time and efforts on any of this if no one can take anything from it all. I should not expect anyone to really give a damn about the opinion of one man from a mid western city who is a philosopher to some, but to others is just another typical male who doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground. So that's it. This is the last on my bullshit. I'm done. After I put the chairs up on all of the tables, be sure to turn the lights out and lock up as you leave. 

Sayonara."

"event","Time has a rather strange effect upon the human psyche. It can turn a person that one loves into someone that the same person would much rather see six feet deep in a pine box. I crossed paths with a person of such a circumstance a few nights ago. It seems odd that someone who I held in such high regard at one point in time could inspire hatred that I had carried with me for years. And as this individual stood before me that night, I began to see why our paths separated. Not only did I notice that she was not the same person that I knew all those years ago; but I came to realize just how much the man who stood before her was not the same man that she knew back then either. I was civil towards her; which was the best that I could do considering how she had wounded me in the past. I no longer hate her, but I can't help the memories that come when I see her. I find myself reliving moments that are dead in the dust in the back of my mind. I think of questions that can't be asked, and wonder what kind of answer I would have received. Then again, if ever in life you feel that you have failed someone, there will always be questions of why and how. The same can be said of all failures in general, come to think of it.

      The aforementioned experience has led me to understand just how fragile a thing loyalty is. You find someone that you believe to be a person worthy of your trust (at some degree) and loyalty, only to find that there is a terrible price to pay for such actions. The trouble with being a loyal friend to someone is that the person that you believe to be worthy of your trust can easily deceive and betray you; leaving you with just enough of your senses left to realize that you have played the fool. You give of yourself honestly and provide for someone, only so that they take from you and leave you bled of all of your feelings and filled with revulsion and bitterness.

     There is one other consequence of loyalty that is making itself more and more clear in my life at present. The idea behind loyalty to someone is that you will be there for them if needed or wanted; the trouble with this is if you are not needed in any way, you are usually left to yourself unless someone needs something. If things are going wrong or a potential threat finds its way into a friends life, they practically beat down my door as the phone rings off the hook because they need help in one form or another; yet if all is well in their lives, I end up being the one to make the phone calls. If not, the phone falls silent as the stoop outside my door remains vacant. They only want you if they know that you can help them; otherwise you are of no use and are put on a shelf to wait until the time comes when your service or counsel is once again needed. Despite how I tend to dismiss emotions as a waste of time or an obstruction of logical thought, everyone has them; including me. And thanks to such emotions, it can make your life seem worthless if no one needs you for anything.

     So, in conclusion my advice to anyone who might read this is to remember all of those who have helped you in your life in any way. Take a moment to call them up or pay them a visit to thank them. Even though true loyalty does not come with conditions, it never hurts to let someone know that somewhere out there is someone who is grateful for all that they have done."

You are a peaceful and affectionate soul... and by nature rather reserved and analytical. 

The overwhelming strength of the number 7 is reflected in the depth of thinking that is shown.

You will garner knowledge from practically every source that you find. 

Intellectual, scientific and studious, you don't accept a premise until you have dissected the subject and arrived at you own independent conclusion. 



This is a very spiritual number and it often denotes a sort of spiritual wisdom that becomes apparent at a fairly early age. You need a good deal of quiet time to be with your own inner thoughts and dreams. 

You dislike crowds, noise and confusion. 



You are very thorough and complete in your work, the perfectionist who expects everyone else to be a meet a high standard of performance, too. 

You evaluate situations very quickly and with amazing accuracy. 

You rely heavily on your experiences and your intuition, rather than accepting advice from someone.

Your hunches usually prove to be very accurate, and knowing this, you are one who tends to follow the directions they seem to guide. 



It's easy for you to detect deception and recognize insincere people. 

You aren't one to have a wide circle of friends, but once you accept someone as a friend, it's for life. 

You really aren't a very social person, and your reserve is often taken to be aloofness. 

You actually like being alone, away from the hustle and bustle of modern life.

In many ways, you would have fit in better in much earlier times when the pace of life was less hectic.



In the most negative use of the 7 energies, you can become very pessimistic, lackadaisical, quarrelsome, and secretive. 

A Life Path 7 individual who is not living life fully and gaining through experiences.

A negative 7 is  a hard person to live with because of a serious lack of consideration. 

The negative 7 is very selfish and spoiled. 



If you have any of the negative traits they are very difficult to get rid of.

At your worst, you feel that the world really does owe you something - or in some way you aren't being fairly treated. 

Fortunately, the negative 7 is not the typical 7, at least not without some mitigating positive traits. 

This number is one that seems to have some major shifts from highs to lows.

"event","Responsibility is a damnable thing. Responsibility is what forces me to drag myself out of bed at four o'clock in the morning five days a week. Responsibility is what forces me to work myself to the point of exhaustion and physical pain, only to be left with the impression that the work I do is barely enough to keep my job in good standing. And from where I stand, I have no other choice but to completely give up my life in the name of my job. My job leaves me lacking the energy or the money to go out and enjoy my life, and thanks to my progress in obtaining my driving permit for my CDL license, it is now forcing me to work Saturday mornings along with the usual five day a week routine. This means that I will have to sacrifice any opportunity that might arise on any given Friday night to go out and enjoy myself so that I can wake up on time to go back into that fucking slave pit Saturday morning. It's funny, but when I was a child I was always of the belief that adulthood was a state of freedom where you could sometimes do what you wanted. Little did I know that it entailed selling yourself out to a job if you intend on having any semblance of a career. I no longer have the time to even consider what I would want to do with my time because it is already being devoured by this fucking bullshit job that I have to make a life out of. It frustrates me to such an extent that I can't think straight, only so that I can be told that my perception is the reason why I'm stressed out to the point that I want to go out on some hate - fueled rampage and burn the world down. It's a good thing for me that hate is much less expensive than gasoline."

"event","It's a calm spring evening, and the light of day is slowly fading as I sit here. Duke Ellington's ""Prelude To A Kiss"" drifts through the air along with the smoke from my cigarette as I try to think of something of worth to write. The problem is that I can't really think of anything to write about that would be worth reading. I came to find out this past weekend that Death has one hell of a sense of humor. I'm in a friend's car along with my girlfriend and we're just cruising down the street when a pick up truck runs a red light and misses us by an inch...literally. In the split second that it happened, I realized that I was completely calm. As I saw the truck heading for us, I just sighed and thought ""Hell, this could be a kick. Why not?"". The one thing that put me in slight shock was when it hit me that my girlfriend and a good friend of mine were also in the car. I could have lost one or both of them if that truck had hit us. And what does the driver of the runaway pick up have to say for himself? ""I was just drivin' to git a pack of smokes! I aint got no insurance or nuthin!"" Like I said, Death: one funny son of a bitch.

     Looking back on this got me thinking about a friend of mine. This girl used to watch me when I was an infant. She used to talk to my mother about possibly having a kid of her own one day. This girl led a rather sheltered life; always on lock down because of her parents. Thy might have been over protective, or she might have hung out with the wrong crowd, I'm not sure. I guess her dreams of motherhood or any of her other future inspirations failed to stop her actions the night that her parents left her home alone. She went into their bedroom, found her father's gun, and redecorated the wall above their headboard with her brains. Funny thing was, that head board was more than likely connected to the same bed where she was conceived.
     
     Another acquaintance of mine I knew in high school. The guy dealt drugs and fucked around most of his life, but in the process he managed to find a woman who stole his heart. He practically worshiped the ground that she walked on. I still can't determine which hurt more: the day she walked out of his life, or the round from the shotgun that he force fed himself to fill the space that she left behind. Somehow I doubt that the cold steel of that barrel in his mouth was as satisfying as any of the times he felt her lips in it's place. It just goes to show you that you can't fix a hole in your heart by putting a bigger one through your head.
 
     I know that most of you reading this may be wondering what kind of inhumane lunatic could find any of these instances amusing. Here's the reason, plain and simple: One goes through this life with all sorts of plans and dreams and goals, yet in the end we all end up six feet beneath the earth in a wooden box. The trouble is, no one is ever able to know for certain when the time comes for them to take the last ride. Even if it does end up being one's own hand that drops the blade or pulls the trigger on their own life, they never understand what chain of events leads to such an extreme sense of desperation until it's too late. I know that a lot of you out there are sitting there in front of your monitors with the feeling that your life has fallen apart. I know how that feels, believe me. I know that several of you have thought about the big sleep a time or two, I've done the same a few times in the past. But the problem with suicide is that it's a permanent solution for a temporary problem. As much as I reference things like suicide, I know that it solves nothing, and that people resort to it anyway. I've been close enough to that point in the past to realize that losing everything is sometimes the only way to realize what you truly have. The only way to truly know what that's like is to be strong enough to survive yourself in times like those. To sum it all up; live your life in the most fulfilling way possible. Live for the best times, live through the worst. Learn to appreciate everything that this life makes you feel, good or bad. After all, you never know when you'll find that son of a bitch with the reaper standing over your shoulder, laughing his ass off."

"event","This is quite possibly the single most confusing way of belief that I have ever encountered. A means of making sense through no sense at all. The religion of Zen seems to be one of complete and total self explanation in my mind. Everything will take care of itself. All things will turn out even in the end. There is no need for analysis, no need for dissection of anything: for to take a part of something away and look only to it exclusively deprives one of the opportunity to look at the entirety of anything as a whole; yet the myriad intricacies of anything combined make up it's existence as a whole.

 From my perspective, as a warrior of sorts; I may draw the blade, I may not. Either way, if I am meant to survive, I will. If not; I will perish. It's as if there is some sort of secret system of balance in everything that is hidden in plain sight. This leaves me to question the places and purposes for certain aspects of existence; take Fate, for instance. What place is there for Fate in a state of existence where everything always ends up even, yet one is said to have free will; despite the inability for one to alter one's predestined path, as dictated by Fate? Technically, would struggling to alter one's Fate throw this unseen system of equality completely off balance? If all things in this life take place for a reason, how can there be a lack of need for an explanation to find those reasons? 

     Take love as another example. Why is it that while one is in love with someone, it appears that their love needs no explanation; yet, if that same love fades away, why does it seem so important at that moment that one have an explanation as to why things did not work out? How is it that some people who walk away from a bad relationship seem to long for the one who hurt them; while others who walk away from a relationship where their significant other did no wrong to them hate them anyway? 

      Finally; look at humanity as a species. We, like other animals on this planet, live to reproduce and populate this world with our kind; we teach love, acceptance, and coexistence in our schools to our children. Yet because we are humans, we seem to excel in killing ourselves off for both foolish and logical reasons. We wage wars based on prejudices of virtually every sort while teaching our youth to love and accept each other for who they are. I can understand balance within humanity; for every vile detestable person in this world, there is one who is virtuous and pure of heart. For every person who lacks pity, there is one who possesses an abundance of compassion. But why do we seem to contradict ourselves like this so much?

     Perhaps the meaning behind Zen is not so much in learning how to teach yourself to balance between darkness and light, but to determine which side you wish to advocate while acknowledging the fact that both sides exist within yourself...all at once. Perhaps there is some order in chaos after all."

"event","""Love... love kills the demon""

     Valentine's Day has always been a strange one for me. I can't quite explain it. It always seems to be a good day for goodbyes. Before any of you inquire, No; Maria is not going anywhere, as a matter of fact I believe that she is the happiest that she has ever been in our relationship (which hit the Year And A Half mark last Thursday). What I mean to say is that I always end up thinking, just for a moment, of every person who ever told me goodbye in my life around this day every year. I don't mean to sound depressing about this (even though I seem to be rather adept at it most of the time), but it all relates to the old idea that if a person ever loved someone else, there will always be at least a small shred of that love left in their former lover or friend's heart for the rest of their mortal lives. I fully acknowledge this (despite how repulsive it is to me in the case of certain individuals): and, ironically enough, appreciate all of those who walked with me at any certain point in my life. Yeah; quite a few of them betrayed me, and others tore my entire world apart: but if it were not for all of those bitter acquaintances, I would not be half as much a man as I am currently. As for those of you who are still around after all these years, I appreciate your patience and commend you all for your resolve. 
     To be honest, I've recently fallen into a trap of sorts. Almost everyone is familiar with the bait: it works every time: the scent of her hair, the sound of her heart beat in those dead hours of night when it seems as though the entire world is bathed in shadows and dead calm, the way that moonlight plays off of her body as she sleeps, even the softness and warmth of her skin as she lies beside you. These are all vices that I once thought I could never indulge in again. It seems as though, for moments at a time, that I was once again mistaken. Every once in a while I lose myself for a second or two in all of these things. As terrifying as all of this is to me, I can honestly say that I haven't had this great of a time in quite a while. In regard to my angel with her flowing mane of raven hair and the most loving eyes to ever fall on my miserable hide; I owe you everything. As for the rest of you, I have but only one question... Do you believe in Fate?"

"event","WARNING: What you are about to read is the product of a once reasonable mind that was pushed far beyond it's limits. Read on if you care to waste a bit of time.

     I fail to understand why it is that people seem to be out to piss me off, shatter any aspirations that I might have, or make a complete mockery of me. I know that this is more than likely another instance of me taking things far too seriously; but I think I've just about had it with humanity in general. I have aspirations and ideals that I hold in the highest of respect, only so that the majority of the people around me can tear them down, either by laughing at my ideals, or trying their damnedest to tell me that I am wrong, no matter what I may or may not believe. Whatever happened to leaving someone to their beliefs as long as they don't cause harm to anyone? Whatever happened to the idea of live and let live? I'll tell you what happened: ignorant, arrogant people fucked it up for everyone. Every time I try to find some sort of solace or faith in anything, it gets shot to Hell because of stupid ass motherfuckers around me constantly running their mouths to the point where it finally forces me to question myself about said beliefs; only to throw these beliefs out the window: shattering the glass and my pride only to fall to their certain (if not premature) demise for the sake of silencing all of those around me. I hear on a seemingly daily basis about how wrong I am in just about everything I think about. I'm sick and fucking tired of being wrong. No one seems to accept the fact that everyone thinks about everything from individual and differential points of observation; much less do they care to acknowledge that any other point of observation can have any more validity than their own. And every time these people come at me with their insults and ridicule, it forces me back into a more primitive method of thought that I held above everything in my earlier days. This method was, in my opinion, what the world wanted me to believe. It goes a little something like this...

     First of all, know that you are born from dirt, and that dirt is all that you will ever be. Dirt beneath the boots of the rest of the world because no one gives a fuck about what concerns you. This world is out for itself entirely, and all people, no matter what they may appear to be about, want nothing more than to dominate everything; even if that means ripping your intestines out and tossing your pathetic carcass away to rot on the roadside. The rich and the powerful will always be secure in their authority and wealth; and the poor, like you, will always starve so that they may be fed. A few years after you are born, you go to school, where they teach you that the world is a beautiful place where everyone can live peacefully. You go through school slowly being convinced otherwise by those around you. From there you either go to college (if mommy and daddy can pay for it, or if you can manage to pay for it yourself and survive), or you live to break your back at some menial job that you grow to hate as the days, weeks, months and years pass: only to end up getting nothing in return for it. All of your efforts and best attempts wasted, you either spend your life waiting to see what happens next, or you speed up the inevitable by giving everything up to the edge of a razor across your wrist or the smoking barrel of a pistol as it falls lifelessly from your lips to the floor of the house or apartment where you die alone.

     I understand that most of what was written above is completely untrue, but the frustration that comes from constantly hearing people around me forces me into this state of complete hopelessness. It is because of people of this caliber that I built a wall a while back (anyone who knows me knows exactly what I am referring to), and I am still trying to tear it down while resisting the urge to build it all back up again.

"event","Alright: even though I am well aware that many of those who read this may not immediately comprehend all of it, I hope that it may at least give you something to think about. If it does indeed provoke thought: please dispense this Live journal address to as many people that can use the information herein as possible. 

     Let's begin with what may or may not be completely obvious to all of you: WAR IS THE WAY OF IMPETUOUS YOUTH. It seems almost too difficult to accept, but it requires some thought. When a person is young, it appears as though the entire world is naturally opposed to anything that this person may do, say, think, or believe in his or her heart. Because of this opposition, this causes many to lose their heads and decide that the only response to it all that makes the slightest bit of sense is to lash out at everyone and everything; in essence, to tear the world apart because it condemned them. The sheer tenacity of youth causes them to wage war against the world around them: without fear, without regret. Some may admire the passion behind such causes, despite how senseless it all seems a few decades down the line. It is this passion that those who are up in years beg father time to once again possess. Therefore, it stands to reason that the way of the elder is one of wisdom, peace or at least an understanding of the same world that they themselves once lashed out so violently against. Thus, one of the many difficulties in comprehending the world rears it's ugly head; the problem that after fifty or so years in this realm of existence, life seems to lose meaning. Life goes from being some brilliant adventure to becoming a repetitious source of stress and self-induced madness. Life is nothing less than a bore to many of those who lose the spark of vitality that is youth. Therein lies one of the many grand disillusions of life. Allow me to elaborate...

     There are those who believe that once youth has faded, such passion fades along with it. This does not have to be the case. If anything, the passion that one feels in his or her youth should be amplified by the wisdom that only comes with either A) living through an incredibly difficult life, or B) years upon years of experience. In my opinion, half of life is the consequences of blind fate, and the other half is entirely what you make it, including the reactions to such consequences. The point is simply this; time may cause the fire in the heart of mankind to dim slightly with the passing years; but that does not mean that the flames can never again be fed. All that I can offer up to any of those who read this as proof is that as I sit and write this, even at the age of twenty two years, I can feel the flames in my own heart fade out slightly: and despite the deep sorrow that comes with this, I struggle to live silently in search of Satori (inner peace), without fear of man, beast, or otherwise. It's called Bushido... Look it up."

"event","Friends, I'd like to talk a little bit about that cursed yet exhilarating thing called love. I know, I know: you have heard thousands upon thousands of people talk to you about what love is and is not in what they deem to be ""definite terms"", but I would like, for a change of pace, to try to illuminate both sides of this double - edged - sword for your consideration. Try to follow if you can...

     To start with, I once believed love to be this absolutely euphoric state of bliss where the object of your affections could do no wrong. Love to me was a truly amazing thing; though it was beyond my grasp. I spent many years in depression because of the aforementioned fact. Until, at one point, I believed that I had found it. I was with a woman for a long time and believed that she loved me just as much as I did her: until the day that I found that she had deceived me and was cheating on me the entire time. It was rather easy for her: she simply told me what I wanted to hear for the time of our relationship, until she eventually got bored with toying with me and cast me aside like refuse. As you might imagine, I was absolutely crushed for quite a long time: and continued to stay that way even after I met the woman that I am currently with. She tried constantly for 16 months to break me out of the mindset that I had built in order to keep myself safe: that mindset being that all women were purely evil, and wanted nothing more with an honest man like me than to use me up and throw me away. Love went from being a state of euphoric bliss to being the sweetest venom ever devised. Love was more to me at this point in my life like a disease or plague: it made the sufferer blind to the obvious, caused them inadvertently to place a set of expectations upon their lovers that said lovers could never hope to aspire to. Love was like any narcotic: an addiction that could easily kill a man or woman. 

     But time did pass, and eventually I came to something of a realization. Love is not the state of euphoric bliss, nor is it the addictive venom; it is both. To love someone who does not love you as much is the aforementioned venom that can completely destroy the spark of vitality that lies in any human being. Love, once lost, can cause the soul to freeze; to where the aforementioned soul wants for absolutely nothing, if not for their time on earth to end. But eventually, love does come to find you again; whether you want it or not. Love from someone who loves you more than you love them can be just as much a blessing as it can be a curse. The way to overcome the curse part of this is to eventually learn, as I have, that this person loves you despite your misgivings; and that if they did not, then they would not waste their time trying to get it through your head. If the misgivings in your mind are not because of some previous pain (as it is with most), and you find that you just don't love the person in the same way that they love you, then I suggest that you walk away from them as gently as possible: and bear in mind that this individual meant you no harm. 

     To those of you who may be in love at this point and happen to read this, do yourselves a favor; ask yourselves just how much you honestly love the one that you are with. If you find that things don't seem to even up between you and your significant other, immediately attempt to resolve this matter (for communication is vital for any relationship, in my opinion). If things can't be evened out, then leave as soon as possible, because time will only extenuate the suffering of you both if you hesitate. If you find that everything balances out perfectly, then do everything in your power (as your mate will no doubt follow your actions) in maintaining said balance, keeping in mind that it is an extremely delicate one. 

     If you happen to be single and you have read this, my advice to all of you is not to go out and look for love instantly. It is simply to enjoy the freedom that you currently possess; and rest assured that the more that you do enjoy this freedom, the quicker someone will come along to take it from you. In the instance of men, women may not be pure evil (though they do have very much potential to be as such), but it has been said that many women always want what they can't have, and if you are too consumed by your happiness in your own life to worry about gaining their affections, they will almost instantaneously wonder why you show no interest in them; giving them the impression that you do not want them, which in turn drives them to persist in their efforts to claim you as their own. In the case of single women, know that the rumors are true, and that the vast majority of men are fools. Men will succumb to your will if the correct approach is used; though I strongly suggest that your intentions be pure and not to deceive because, believe it or not, men talk just about as much as you do. If your cruel or self serving intentions harm enough men, eventually you will be cursed with the nearly unshakable burden of ill repute. If you feel attracted to a man, then by all means try to talk to him; but, if things do happen to go wrong and he is not quite what you expected, then please do them a favor and let them go without cheating on or lying to them constantly: it is not worth the effort of setting everything up and fabricating enough bullshit to make them believe that you love them when you don't anyway.

     Well; that's just about it. If you're out there and you're in love, congratulations. If you're out there and you're single, enjoy it while it lasts: for love does come for everyone... eventually."

"event","The season of Christmas is upon us again and in full swing. I realize this by the cheap marketing strategies of retailers city wide; and, just as it happened last year, it all fails to impress me. I find it difficult to believe that this season is supposed to be all about the giving and not the receiving when all I see anymore are sale prices in storefront windows and the constant threat of the ever - increasing list of people to buy gifts for. Granted; I personally have several things to be thankful for and appreciative of this year (no; it's not ALL doom, gloom, and unbridled pessimism. Sorry kids); but before I get into all of that, lets look at the bullshit that accompanies good old Saint Nick, shall we?

     First of all, all over the city I can see the dollar signs in the eyes of all people: for the wealthy, this means a shopping spree with reckless, abandon: shooting from store to store and buying nearly everything in sight in the full knowledge and security that they will be more than able to provide their friends and family an abundance of gifts: regardless of the price tag. For those not so fortunate, this means tiresome hours of work followed by the strenuous exercise of shopping for their loved ones and entering the madhouse that is the modern day shopping mall in the month of December, pushing through the masses with the ideas of presents floating around in their minds; along with the threat of the cost of each item versus the amount of money in their budget. Once said gifts that are within said boundaries are acquired, the thoughts of ""I hope that (insert family member or friend's name here) will like this"" or ""I wish I could have got them something better than this"" tear through their minds; depriving some of sleep and providing them immense worrying to compensate for it all. It is for this reason alone that I think that the most intelligent move for anyone to make this Christmas is to do what you can, but be certain above all things that your gifts are from the heart; and to bear the same in mind on Christmas Day, or Hannukah, or Kwanzaa, or whatever it is that your family celebrates. Yeah, the bright green sweater that your aunt buys you might look like something that Linda Blair puked up in <U>The Exorcist</U>; but she did the best she could. It's as simple as that.

     And now for the sentimental part of our program. I wanted to take time out from my constant contemplation of the state of the world to give thanks to those in my life that deserve it. To Mike, your friendship is an honor to possess. To Jon, thanks for being the only brother a guy could ever need. To Mick, your insight, though somewhat unnoticed by the many, is held in the highest esteem by the few: including me. To Caroline, your friendship and advice has taught me a lot about both the world and myself. Thank you very much for your sympathy in times of suffering, your company, and for the mercy in you *wink*. To Robert, thank you ever so much for being one of the few people left that can make me crack a smile regardless of the situation, yet make me think at the same time. To Griff, thanks to you I have a much deeper sense of what honor truly is. I'll be watching the shadows for you, ya stealthy bastard! To Chuck, you may be the most recent of my friends, but you are appreciated just as much as the rest. Thanks for hanging around, in times of boredom as well as intrigue. To Sam, thanks for putting up with the impetuousness of youth; and offering wisdom despite it. And finally, to Maria: your love means more to me than mere mortal words can ever express. My only regret is that I am still too much of a fool to completely realize it. Thank you for your undying support, patience, and tolerance. You are a shining example of true compassion, which any angel would be blessed to experience; not to mention a man like me. I love you with all my heart. Well, I think that just about does it for the thank you's. If I have forgotten anyone, I sincerely apologize; and I wish you all a scary little Christmas."

"event","America is the land of opportunity, where anyone has the chance to make a name for themselves: or at least that's what I'm told. I have been a resident here in America for my entire life; and it seems strange to me how freedom can be misconstrued. 

From my experience, freedom is the idea of being forced into an organized educational system that forces rules and regulations down your throat; or, if you happen to befall the same fate that I did and ended up attending parochial school, you are force-fed religion in a place where even your source of faith is subject to a seemingly fascist regime. You end up leaving grade school and entering high school; a place where your every weakness and insecurity is exposed and exploited by virtually all of those who surround you. You struggle to express your own individuality as it is encouraged by many instructors, only so that those same instructors inflict punishment for certain acts of expression. Even saying the wrong thing is subject to punishment; ironic, considering that freedom of speech is a right given to all people. In my opinion, high school was like boot camp for a desk job, where you are taught that your opinion is virtually worthless, so defending it is a waste of time. According to them, you might as well sit down, shut the fuck up, and do your job. Take the insults from your co-workers while sucking up to the boss so that your level of Hell is not quite as buried in shit as those who still cling to their originality. 

After being stripped of nearly everything that makes you capable of expressing yourself, you are thrown out into what is referred to as the ""real world"", which means going to college (either through your parent's money or to struggle to pay for it on your own while working a job and going to class at the same time and eventually amassing an inconceivable amount of debt), or finding a job. If you are unfortunate enough to take the same road that I did and enter the work force shortly before leaving high school and staying with the idea of finding a decent job; good luck to you. A decent job for one who does not have some sort of bullshit degree in something entails a job that pays slightly above minimum wage that offers insurance benefits that you will need when the job literally breaks your back, and a retirement plan; so that when you become permanently bedridden, the company you work for can boot you out the door with something to barely get by on while they wait for fresh meat to send into the grinder.
 

The land of the free is just a euphemism for being a slave to a career. The amount of money you make places you in a tax bracket which metaphorically is much like a stack of cages filled with cattle: the lower the amount of money that you make, the lower the cage that you are thrown in, leaving the rich cash cows to sit without worry as they shit all over the poor bastards in the lower cages, still dragging around carts while they wait for that one way trip to the slaughterhouse. And while the least wealthy of humanity may seem to live buried in shit: they live on welfare without having to work at all; so their apathy relieves the pain of their position in the food chain. If you are wealthy: America is just how it is described, you are free to live your life and do as you please. If you are of the working class or lower, life is the daily grind of going to a job that you have grown to despise for most of the week, only to come home each night with sore muscles and just enough of your will left to resist shooting yourself in the head so that you can wake up the next morning and do it all over again. Some are able to find solace in the weekend, only to face the dread of returning to work the following Monday morning with a heavy heart and battered brain. Others choose to find solace in vices that will slowly kill them, such as alcohol or narcotics or even prostitutes; but if they die, they are of the lower class anyway, so in the bigger scheme of things, their deaths are irrelevant, at least to the local government officials and the wealthy citizens of the city. To the wealthy, those people are not tortured souls screaming for release form the chains that bind them; they are all ""just another junkie"", or ""just some low life piece of shit"". The trouble is, with a job that takes everything that you have to keep going, you don't really have much of a life: just a work schedule.

I'm not trying to say that the rich are the sole cause of everything that is wrong with the world, it just seems as though it is a lot easier for them to live than it is for the working class. I know that this may seem depressing and overwhelmingly pessimistic, but there is a lesson to be learned in all of this: The next time that you pass someone on the street who appears to be not as well off as you, or someone who seems to drag him or herself along the street with hopeless eyes, offer them a kind word, or at least say hello to acknowledge their existence, because a lot of them don't feel like they exist anyway. To them, they live without living. They drag themselves through this life with nothing, and to be offered even the slightest bit of respect for the hard work that they do would mean the world to them."

"event","It's hilarious to me that so many people are into following trends these days. It's funny how someone who has the cash to spend $80 on a pair of blue jeans because they are made by a certain clothing company will not only buy the jeans, but the $50 shirt to match (the t shirt that conveniently bears the logo of the aforementioned designer so that the braindead little idiots who wear the clothing don't forget the person who finances all of the sweatshops in Malaysia where their products are mass-produced). People seem to think that wearing a certain perfume will make you popular, when at best it will catch the response of random people sniffing you at will and asking the dumbfounded question ""What is that perfume/cologne you're wearing?"". They don't know that it's made by Tommy Hilfiger; much less that you spent $125 on a six-ounce bottle of it, they just know hat they like what they smell. You could coat a piece of human feces in Calvin Klein's Obsession and guess what? The people who like Obsession will like the scent of that piece of shit; but it's still shit. 

I also find it amusing that Starbucks Coffee is something of a status symbol for not only pseudo-intellectual, Modest Mouse listening college students who aspire to be apathetically intelligent, yet end up looking like miniature clones of Bob Geldoff, but it's becoming something of a status symbol for middle-aged people as well; thinking that this coffee is some sort of fountain of youth that might make them seem ""cool"" or ""hip"" like their younger counterparts. This is why I find it hilarious to imagine a beggar on a downtown street shaking a Starbucks cup full of loose change in his greasy hands as he asks the random passers by for a cigarette. People spend a shit load of money on the overpriced coffee while he starves on the street. 

I like Starbucks coffee as much as the next person; but unlike them, I realize that Starbucks is full of complete commercialized bullshit. I don't drink the coffee because I think it will make me seem cool or because it might get me in with the pseudo-intellectual college kids; I drink it because it fucking tastes good. I wear clothes because I like the way they look; no matter who fucking makes them. So in conclusion; let me state that life is definitely not a popularity contest; and the most important thing that I find in this life, along with the constant learning that life gives you, is to always be true to yourself; because if you are true to what everyone else prescribes to, you become like they are, another mindless zombie roaming The Gap in search of Khakis."

"event","When I first heard of the entire concept of an internet journal, I had to laugh. I imagined some kid out there thinking ""Wow. I can type all of my deepest secrets and hidden thoughts on this convenient web page and no one will ever know"" (obviously this aforementioned child is not all that bright), only so that all of the people who know him (or her) eventually find the site and constantly ridicule the site's contributor. Because of this little example, I would like to make it clear that I WILL NOT use this page to chronicle the bullshit happenings of my everyday life; because in my opinion, no one really gives a fuck about all of that shit anyway. Instead, I will use this page as an outlet of my ever-changing insight and observations about the world and society at large. Some of those who may read this may think me insane, others may praise me as a genius. Either way, I don't give a damn about any of that. As long as some of those who read these entries and learn something from them; then my purpose in this little project will be fulfilled. And if you are the type of person who really doesn't care to learn anything from anyone; at least you can laugh at my stupid ass. On that note; let the vivisection begin..."

Piccies from Halloween!!!! YAY!! We had an awesome partay at Dan G's apartment (which is the shit)
and he made pizza and I made this super cute graveyard cake (that I wish I had taken a pic of) with little graves and marshmallow Ghosts, and yeah, basically it rocked ^_^

So, all in all, it was much fun!! There were TONS of people (although I missed a lot of them with my camera [ex, Angie- so sad!!!]) 
I wish I had gotten some better pics, but Greggie and Elise stole my camera and seriously did a makeout photoshoot, so, maybe next time...."

My youngest aunt went to France (ages ago), married this wonderful french pro hockey player (Thomas) and now has such an adorable little baby!!!  Best part is, they're in Vermont for a whole month, so I get to meet her!! YAY!!!!!!!!!!

"event","Heya all!!

So lmfao sick right now, it's ridic.  No voice to speak of, I've been half whispering/ half croaking all day. It's very fun.I'm so drunk/high on NyQuil, you'll have to excuse my rants.  However, I am taking this lovely time I have to binge on all the yummy, silky things  I have in my refrigerator, as they feel good on my raw, sore-ass-from-coughing-throat. So far, have downed lots of pretzels with whipped cream cheese, (okay, okay, the pretzels hurt, but the cc was delightful) yummy yummy yummmy YoCrunch vanilla yogurt with nestle crunch candy in it,(again, crunch candy was not so fab, but tasted delicious) oatmeal to the kazoo-yum, chai tea-(spices hurt, but sorta soothing) and a crapload (at least a pint) of this yummy expensive sorbet stuff that dear Chris went shopping with me for- LOVE IT! My freezer does not, however, as it sucks too much to freeze things, so it's a wee bit soupy, but Hey! Who's complaining?

I've noticed that whenever I get sick, I am more prone to hiccups. Case in point, right now! Damn it all. This is the... i think 6th time in the past 3 days. They just won't go away. God is smiting me. 
Oh yeah?? Well, I smite you back!!! I'm going to use my grandfather's fail proof 100% effective hiccup cure. (And no, Chris, it is not to think of cows!!!)  That is... when I can stop hiccuping long enough to do it. WE'll see.

On a very fun note, I broke 1 ipod today, and fixed another. Dad and Alex both have monocrome 20gb ipods, both of which were fucked to hell, alternating between showing the sad icon and the folder icon. Me, being the sadly enough ipod expert, tried pretty much everything, to no avail. The ipods kept freezing itunes and mycomputer, they wouldn't mount, restart, restore..nada. They would, however, go into disk mode, so I still had hope.  Called up APPLE, only to have them tell me my ipods were fucked to hell (thanks i already knew that) and that since both were out of warranty, it would be $270each to fix. (keep in mind, kiddos, a new 30gb ipod is 299) I of course, being relatively sound of mind, said ""Fuck that shit"" and decided to search for a better way.
I joined all these forums, read all these haqcks, installed a few ipod fixes, to no avail. Then I found a suggestion that reccommended beating the shit out of your ipod, to good results. I thought, ""why not, they're already fucked"" and proceeded to slam my sister's ipod into my desk, numerous times for good measure.
And voila!!! LMFAO, the stupid thing started working!! Itunes recognized it, said it was corrupt, and let me restore it for the first time in over a week. Now, all of my library is on it, its working dandy, and I am ecstatic. Simply amazing.
Kids, the lesson of the day is  ""Kicking the shit out of your software is the way to go""

Of course, proceded to try it with dad's, and it started working for a while, but the restore wasn't solving anything, wacked it some more, and kids, I think it's a goner.
SO, I took it apart.Was TRES fun. Disconnected the battery and harddrive, only to realize that the hd is the problem; it's made by TOSHIBA(of all things) and can be replaced for around $140...much better than the 270 apple offered!!
Of course, I don't have that kind of money, so it's going to stay dead, but it was wicked fun to dissamble it, and if i can ever afford it, I'm positive I can get it working again! Or, if not, now I have an extra battery!! Woot!!   If anyone has a broken ipod they'd like to part with, I would love to take a look at it, and see if the hd is the issue!! Or, if you need a battery, I'm your wo-man!!



MAJOR KUDOS to Cabaret at MMUHS!!!  talent, talent, talent! Loved it!! ( the length of bands 1+2 sent my head spinning, but still very talented) Love to Laura, my bro, Annalise, Mason, Ariel, and of course, Jessie the mc ^_^

Happy Belated Birthday (once again) to Mariah!!! Hope your day was smashing, darling!!! Miss you, and hope to see you soon


I am SOOOOOOOO excited that you guys FINALLY know the musical!! I've been holding it back forever!! It's going to be awesome!! Once on this Island was performed ..two years? before I went to MMU, and  Mariah and I begged candy to do it again in our years.. you lucky ducks!!
 If anyone needs a copy of the soundtrack, ask Addy to burn you one, I gave him my cd!!

anyway... groggy as all hell, so I'll say goodnight, but I just had to update, it's been too long."

A bunch of gears, getting rusty, 
and then coming to a haltering, shuddering stop...

Things happen, but the warmth is gone. 
The fun is gone.
The love is gone.

There's nothing left.
No aspirations.
No exciting events.
Nothing to look forward to.

Just one giant blob of indifference
and mutilation.

And you think, what's the matter?
Why can't I LIVE?
Why is the world spinning for everyone
while I stand SO still?

Nothing matters anymore.
Nothing is worth anything.
Everything...is...just...frozen."

Did I see sirens go flying past?

Though I don't know what tomorrow's bringing

I've got a singular impression

Things are moving too fast

I'm gliding smooth as a figure skater

I'm riding hot as a rocket blast

I just expected it ten years later

I've got a singular impression

Things are moving too fast

And you say, 'Oh, no

Step on the brakes

Do whatever it takes

But stop this train

Slow, slow! The light's turing red'

But I say: No! No!

Whatever I do

I barrel on through

And I don't complain

No matter what I try

I'm flying full speed ahead

I'm never worried to walk the wire

I won't do anything just 'half-assed'

But with the stakes getting somewhat higher

I've got a singular impression things are moving too fast

I found a man that I love

And I found a school that just loves me

Things might get bumpy but

Some people analyze every detail

Some people stall when they can't see the trail

Some people freeze out of fear that they'll fail

But I keep rollin' on

Some people can't get success with their art

Some people never feel love in their heart

Some people can't tell the two things apart

But I keep rollin' on

Oh, oh - maybe I can't follow through

But oh, oh - what else am I supposed to do?

I dreamed of singing with the high and mighty

Now I'm the subject of a bidding war

I met my Peter Pan, 

Aphrodite, I'm doing things I never dreamed of before

We start to take the next step together

and I can't wait till the Twenty Third

The Vermont Cynic's printing my first article

twenty bucks without rewriting one word

I left some friends and I don't regret it

I wrote a song and Peter Jack read it 

My heart's been stolen

My ego's swollen

I just keep rollin' along

And I think

Well, well, what else is in store?

Got all this and more before twenty-four

It's hard not to be sure

I'm spinning out of control

Out of control

I'm feeling panicked and rushed and hurried

I'm feeling outmaneuvered and outclassed

But I'm so happy I can't get worried

About this singular impression

I've got a singular impression things are moving too fast"

"event","Hey Girls!!  

After the craziness of getting into school, adjusting, learning, and missing you all,  I thought it might be time for a long forthcoming post ^_^

Where has that Eliza girl gone?? what's become of her? 

I am at the University of Vermont, as many of you know, trying to make my way in this crazy world right now; just like everyone else... riding the tide.
Whatever you may be feeling about highschool, and whatever dread you hav for the future.. don't worry too much. I swear, college is a lot better... at least, in most retrospects...
The classes are 50,000 times better, the people are more open, less judgemental, there are far less cliques.. plenty of parties, better food, and no one cares if you don't always go to class. No one will slap your wrist if you don't do a homework assignment.

However... you're also shoved with (in my case, 10,000) people that you totally don't know, that totally don't know you, and are hesitant about reaching out, and making good friendship bonds.  It is so much more difficult to make a good gang of lasting friends in college.  Here, there is something we like to call the ""hey mantra""  which basically constitutes of TONS of people you'll say ""hey"" to.. half of whom you don't remember.. most of which you'll never hang out with. 

It can be quite frustrating, coming from a school like MMU where there is such a tighter bond between students- students who can just hang out, be happy, and be great friends, who've all known each other for years. I never realised how difficult it is as an adult to make new friends on your own; friends that you haven't been meshed with since grade school.

Saying such... I really love it here. I do have a small group of friends (lol.. small for me, at least) that are really great people who I can have a ton of fun with. Maybe I've been luckier, as I'm already going to school with two of my best friends.. Kaetlyn and Greggie. Either way.. I've found that half of the time, I feel like i ave all the freinds in the world, and other times.. I'm all alone.

BTW... college theatre is fantastic. I highly reccommend a major in Theatre for any of the bandhallway at MMU. It's jsut so wonderful, so professional.. I love it. Absolutely wonderful. Brings a whole new meaning to scrounging for scraps, sets, etc.  Beleive it or not, I've become more of a techie than I was previously. And I love it.  It's extremely difficult for freshman to get into plays, so, yours truly has been an integral part of set building, painting, EVERYTHING. Im amazed myself.. I never thought I would spend most of my time at college building main sets, moving 2 ton steel bars, using heavy machinery.. learning about paints...
Professional theatre is amazing. To have all the tools, the wood, amchinery, and actually watch, help, nail, screw,  the set into being is the best thing anyone can do!! To paint the stage, and then later, usher at the plays, and listen to everyone say.. ""Wow!!! Look at the set!!""   

It makes me smile



On a different note... a new breakthrough for me...  Josh.  

My Joshua Stanley Partridge. (myspace for pics..)

Josh is.. well,  a major happiness in my life. (and frustration at times ^_^) 
 
Josh lives in Springfield (2 hrs away), is an amazing musician (plays all brass instruments, guitar, bass, sings to boot)  theatre lover, and runner.  My ultimate guy. 

And, he works around 70 hours a week at Black River Produce, (which gives yummy, organic food to everyone.) He rarely has time off, so I've had to quickly adjust to the ups and downs of a monogamous long distance relationships. It's been pretty interesting so far.. as I've always been a full-time girlfriend. I suppose it's been good for me to have to grow emotionally, learn how to handle jealousy, the distance, not communicating every day.  It's given me some time to try not to overly obsess, and keep up with friends, studies.. etc.

 Sometimes i think I'm crazy. I've always been pretty... intense (as you all know) with boyfriends. 
But.. he's worth it to me ^_^  And he makes me happy.. so.. he's a keeper.

At some point, I'd like to be able to introduce him to the gang. I guess we'll see...  (^_~)


In  other news.. I'm still working at Best Buy.. clocking in about 10-20 hours a week.. Friday evenings, saturday mornings.. look for me in wireless- I'd love to see anyone.


SO.. that's the end of my crazy ass long letter...   Sorry.. it's lengthy.. I always did talk too much ^_^

If you're in the area.. give me a holler at Wing 412 (542-8163), 
or cell me (802)779-3654 <----long distance

Love to hear from the gang, and hope to see you at Denny's on Fri! ^_^  (I'll be at the play sometime this weekend...) 

If you're at MMU.. take care of Addy
 That crazy boy needs some guidance... or a wack to the head at times. Try to be.. relatively.. kind 

Love you all.. miss you terribly

Eliza"

"event","So, I really can't believe it...

 Everyone is leaving, and yet, I'm staying behind... ^_^
I mean, of course, I'm going to college, to UVM,and I'm so excited!!!,  but things have changed for sure. I don't know if I made the right decision, perhaps I'll change my mind later.. right now, it just hits me. Oh wow, we're all moving on. Growing up. and this is the end of the summer.

Lol, at graduation, it didn't seem like a big deal. I was ecstatic to be graduated, and on my way, but college seemed miles away, and so I wasn't sad. I didn't cry. Everyone was like, oh this is it, but I didn't realize. I didn't really think, oh my fucking god, this may be the last time I see this person. It was,  ""oh, well, I'll have all summer, I'll walk back into the bandhallway, I'll get to see my buddies, my best friends -  the true important people in my life, a TON. so it won't really matter.""

Now that the summer has come to a close... it's hitting me.  I didn't get to see half of the people I wanted to, I missed the parties and girlnights, and was generally estranged from the group. Whether that was by their doing, or my own, it's water under the bridge now, but damn.  I'm excited though, and relish what we've all had. 

There is no more walking into the bandhallway, bright and early, looking like death with my coffee, and greeting the gang. I missed Kimmie. (which really kiils me!!!.. sweetie, I'm so sorry...I love you, you're the best.. I hope you like your bag ^_^)
It's so crazy how things have changed

MAybe I've tried to keep my head above water, but here's the plunge

I've had a fantastic highschool with everyone. I love you all, and though we've had our differences, the bandhallway has been the best part of my life, and everyone has been so kind, and really made such a difference im my world. I don't know where I'd be without you all, and it has truly shaped my ideals, my interests, and made highschool such a wonderful place. We shared such a great thing.. our little bandhallway.. which of course to passerbys, seems so insignificant. 

But to me, my best memories are there, with you, always.

So, now that my nose is all runny, and i can't see the keys...

Mariah. We've been friends since i can remember.. We've shared so many good times, and bad. We've always competed with each other, on almost everything. And although sometimes, i know we've both driven each other crazy, I love you so much. Thank you for being my longest, and best friend, and for sharing the mishaps of life with me. Little Mermaid phases, the teepee, the briar patch beaver path to our houses, our gum escapade, Swan Princess movie nights, trick or treating, addy and johnathan in laundry baskets, cosplaying, Andrew and the anime gang, Hildegard Hamhocker, the still-delayed otakon trip, theatre, CONSTANT competition in everything ^_^  I've loved it all. I'll miss you so much, and I hope we can continue to stay close friends, going through life together till we're 100 and dead.. even if we're not neighbors anymore ^_^

that one was long... sorry, i had to

Kaetlyn, Greggie, and Eric- you've made my summer the most special time ever. You guys are my best friends, I can't wait for the years ahead, and I love you all so much, but I'm not going to write, because I know you never read these... YAY for fag hags, will and grace, thousands of nights, OUR pub, and much, much more...

Kimmie- I love you so much. Your personality, your ever-clorinated and bleached pixy hair, your obsession with high pointy, impossible to walk on shoes. english class. skittles. road escapades. funny smelling kitchens ^_~. freezing water and swim meets. girly, and fantastic shopping sprees, and random trips to the park. I know you'll be amazing with whatever you do, and I hope we can always stay in touch. Go get 'em, girl!!!

Ryan- lol, wow, I'll be writing a book. Through the good and the bad, you've stayed my friend. You taught me to love, and changed my life more than you'll ever realize. Thank you for being the way you are, damn you for moving to Tennessee, and come home soon. Thanks for the trenchcoat, math class, french w/ Mr. D, cookie making, anime, bakaretsu con, our little corner, paintball, pockets, Shadowlake, the woods, Joe's, good times. Thank you for helping me through hardtimes. I'll always be a mother-figure. I love you, bandanna boy, and always will cherish what we've had. Stay strong, and enjoy life. We'll always keep in touch, I promise ^_~

Andrea- sleeping by the fireplace, blockbuster movie nights, gas-station runs, our song-singing (girl!! join chorus!! damn you're good) crazy adventures in your little car, rope lines, and so much fun. You're my  kid, I adore you, I'm sorry if I haven't been a good role model recently. Your comment made me think. And decide to change back. ^_^ Thanks.  Don't be a stranger, Wing 412, we'll party and have so much fun!!! I can't wait for you next year at UVM!!

Mango- You're the kindest, best friend a girl can have. Thank you for always listening, always being so good, and so much fun. Thank you for always helping me with my makeup disasters, and letting me model for you. Thanks for Zoey, and movies, makeup, pictures, and more pictures, shopping, great talks, I'm keeping this brief cuz I don't think you'll ever read it, but you are the best. 

Canadian- love you, sweetie. I made the best ""Oh, Canada"" video for you, as a present, but lost it all when my comp crashed... I'm sorry you never got to see it, as it was pretty complex, and very fun.
 Thanks for being my friend, and sharing Outdoor Adventure with me. I had some of the best, most rewarding, and most fun experiences with you and Greggie ever, and I'm so glad they happened ^_^ I wish I had gotten to know you more, as you really are such an amazing person. I hope we can keep in touch, and hang out sometimes. Please, please, please, come visit me, if you get the chance

Bazz- as leader of the bandhallway, I bow to you. You were the outstanding force in what made the music hallway run. What a great impact your presence was!!! Without you there, half of the fun would be gone, especially from Selects, and early morning bandhallway...Thank you for letting me sing your songs.  ^_^ Thank you for everything, have so much fun at colelge, and keep playing! ^_^

Natalie, you've been the greatest. again, I wish we had the chance to become closer, but every moment w/ you was crazy fun. I loved your pj pants, and I wish you never had stopped wearing them. Thanks for crazy trips, great sleepovers, good parties, and fun w/ Ryan. Best wishes with you and Will, I hope we can always stay friends.

The rest of the gang... my underclassmen, good friends I've forgotten, you know who you are...
  I'm sorry I can't keep writing.. gotta love dial-up hell, and Mom's angry about tying up her phoneline...
Life in the bandhallway with you guys has been the most rewarding experience ever. thank you for your firendship, and such great, memorable times. I hope to come visit, though I know it will never be the same, but please... if you ever feel like it, or get bored, I'm in room 412 on Wing, at Redstone campus
please, give me a holler on my cell- 802 779-3654
or email me eliza.graves@uvm.edu

love to all

on another note, had a rockin rime w/ Greggie and Kaetlyn last night- went shopping (EEEEE< OLD GOLD ROCKS MY SOCKS, Matt is such a cutie) got new gloves and necklace, plus major sales at gap w/ giftcard from aunt-whooo, what eliza bought w/ 20 bucks, i'm so proud. I saw phantom for my 3rd time-Bazz, Diller, and his gf were thee- very funny. Go BAZZ for being a Phantom fanatic too (this was his 2nd time) Otis was at the theatre w/ dad and sis seeing coach... something..???carter???  My tripping going up the down escalator made the evening, and also made Kaetlyn practically squirt soda thru her nose... ^_^ 

after phantom, went BACK to Churchstreet (YAY FOR ILLEGAL PARKING) to go to the Pub and Brewery- very nice, I'd never been before

yummy salmon was my dinner, and w/ the hot waiter, i enjoyed it immensely  attacked greggie w/ broccoli, drank mustard infested water(NEVER do that) and had the best blast in like 4 years

it made me sad to realize how few close friends i have now- don't argue w/ me, it's a fact. I love everyone in the bandhallway, but NO ONE is close enough to me to call and be like, let's hang out. The only time I see hald of anyone is when I organize big things, and although they're fun, they're not very personal. I don't get to talk to half of my friends, and it makes me sad.  

Aight ...my selfish moment here: I wish people would contact me for something other than OTHER people's phone numbers. Imagine just for one sec how sad that feels? Everyone always does fun stuff, and if it doesn't kill you, as long as you don't hate me, why not drop me a line?
okay, selfishness over, please excuse my bitchiness, just sometimes it gets to me

it was really nice to hang out w/ greg and kaetlyn and sorta, idk, reconnect. i didn't realize how much i was missing. they are such nice people, and i truly had a 100% completely not fake time. I didn't have to pretend, and i really liked it.i hope we can become even closer.  THANKS KAE AND GREGGY!!! ^_^ ^_^ ^_^

today i am sick out of my mind, with a blasting headache and fever, just in time for the play on friday, which my cast is not quite ready for yet. I am pulling my hair out.

When I thought life couldn't get any worse, my mother barged into my crypt-like room (the light hurts my eyes) and started screaming at me about the homework slips I got from teachers. Apparantly, I am close to failing sociology. I am almost proud, in a very fucked up way, as I truly have no idea how I went from an a first quarter, to nearly failing. However, I am assured it is possible, and mom threatens that if everything isn't fixed by friday, i can't direct the play (it's the week of the performance!! what kind of a threat is that????? LOW BLOW) and that when Ryan comes up to visit on friday, he can't stay w/ me(which was going to be my only time to see him)  I am incredibly annoyed and am attempting to catch up as i fight dizziness and fevers.  

On a happier note, when ryan comes he's bringing his nice ddr pad, and considering he's the best (GET THIS--- he can do heavy mode x3 with mirror footing, that btw, is like 50x better and more difficult that the stupid people at pizza putt)I can't wait. We're planning on an all night party/ddr/anime movie watching/who knows what else, and I'm so excited, as w/ ryan, it's bound to be interesting.

hello to you too.


Currently freaking out about colleges. Everyone's visiting and getting excited for college...except me. If anyone's still istening... I am scared. Scared to death. Everything's way too overwhelming and no one will want me. I can't afford any of it, my parents aren't paying anything, and financial aid doesn't cover if the STUDENT is poor, just if the parents are. OMG, I""m so scared!!!  

My dream is to go to Ithaca. I'm applying early decision, I want it so much, but there is NO freaking WAY!!  It's like 35,000 a year, and my grades will NEVER support it. I'm terrified about the essay, even MORE terrified about the audition, and have no idea what I want to do.

Most people go through the application and essay, and that's super stressful. To add an audition, I think I'm going to die. Everyone's thinking, god, she's such a bitchy dramaqueen, but omg I am so terrified it's making me stupidly cry as I write this crap....I'm sorry to complain

DOES ANYONE know of any GOOD musical theatre schools in NY (pref. not NYC) that are under 30,000 if possible, and will take a 3.0 GPA, 1140 SAT student? 
PLEASE RESPOND!! I know normally people brush it aside, never commenting, but this is SO IMPORTANT

I want to take SAT's over but I'm scared I'll do worse...
I don't even know where to begin. Too much crap getting sent to me, no one to talk to, no idea of what's good and what's crap. I just want to go to college, be able to get a job, have fun, and do better in theatre. That's all.

On a brighter note, I just turned in all my applications for a summer job. Went well.  I applied to Shaws, Plato's Closet, Marshalls, Tuscano, Iparty, and Best Buy. Supposedly I'll hear things tomorrow from some of them.

Q, guys, if you really want a job somewhere and think there's a very high chance of getting it, if another place calls wanting you, do you hold out for the hopeful job or give in to the people who've called? Can you be like, ummm, I might like to work for you, can I give you a call back. siigh, i seriously doubt it....

I got a present for Kev on ebay, yaay ^_^ It's supposed to be a suprise, but he basically already knows what it is. Lol, and he's getting me one too, tho I basically already know what that is to. Gods, I love him ^_^ Drat,I thought our anniversary was going to be this fri, but then I realized that I was looking at a may calander. Gotta flip the month....yay, a monday. I hate mondays....

I gave blood at the richmond CC for the 1st time ever...dragged Kev along for moral support and got really dizzy, but it felt good. maybe, someday, someone will be able to survive, and I will have helped a lil bit...^_^  then spent the rest of the day watching Grease, and Rockstar ^_^  Went to the mall avec mon copain ^_^ and bought Wicked on audio tapes YAY

yesterday, gave mom a GIANT GIANT GIANT mug that says ""I am queen"" and got a hug... then did nothing all day until 640, and went to see Kill Bill 2 for the second time with my darling boytoy and 2 of his friends- Melee, I tried to drag you along cuz I thoght maybe you might like to get aquainted with one of them...it was going to be a suprise- your loss sugar, gomen

I love life, it's so nice, and everyone's so kind..... well, almost everyone..

Also, I'm REALLY worried about ryan, as he's been kicked out of his house. I wish there was something I could do, but the way he's going, he's got to crash and hit rock bottom before he works his way up again, and I can't help him.  I hate feeling powerless as I watch friends fall"

Extremely happy, as I just found out my oh so talented cousin- touring offbroadway, is being offered a part in a broadway play!! Sadly, I don't know yet which play, but still, I'm so happy for him!! 
Still...
It really makes you put life in perspective. If he's been struggling for so long, a triple threat, better (and yes I can say this) than +5 Heather Bartletts put together; he can tap, he does jazz, he is hot, he can act and oh fuck can he sing....how can I ever hope to achieve my dream, when he's a billion times more talented than me? How can I even hope to have a chance in college? You've got to be the best of the best, and everyone in drama is so cutthroat. Everyone's envious of each other, everyone's false friends, everyone talks behind everyone's back..I'm scared to even think about the future. I just want to crawl into my lil yellow blankie and cry..."

  Yay I'm back!!!!! (lol, did anyone know I was gone? ah well)  Mariah and I went to NYC and went college visiting. I came home late on thurs on Amtrack bt myself-Kim, I'm still around, no pimps picked me up- and Mariah is going to visit grandparents...whahahaaa!!

It was FANTASTIC! 

First day, tues, was uggie. We drove forever, Mariah's bro is an immature little bug that should be squashed-srry Mariah, but he was REALLY wierd the whole trip, and that was ouchy cuz we were crammed in small car.  When we got to New York, we dumped our junk at the hotel-no swimming pool, boo, and visited BARD!!!!!  If anyone hasn't heard about BARD, I can sum it up in 2 words FANTASTIC + EXPENSIVE. I loved it sooo much!!! It's very liberal, almost hippyish, but just really reminds me of the band hallway ^_^
Every dorm has a kitchen, microwave, cooking is allowed, the food is okay, there are beautiful trees and the scenery is GORGEOUS, the buildings are all very nice, interesting, and scattered throughout the beautiful campus. There's a GIANT, metal, shiny, funny (cool) shaped Performing arts center- it has 6 theatres, all GIANT, the whole school is SOOOOOOOOOOO something i want to be in. Problems- it's 38,000 dollars!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SOOOOOOOOO EXPENSIVE, more so than lots of IVYleagues!!!!! GRRRRRR. They're also really selective, but not by sats or grades. Plus, it's far from kevin -don't laugh or scoff, that's important to me... Idk, but I loved BARD ^_^ ^_^ ^_^

We also visited SUNY Purchase- it was crap, smells like cemetary mold, made up of nazi classes, no performing till end of sophmore year, no musical theatre, no intermixing of one scool with another- I couldn't take music and then take theatre. It was terrible, don't EVER go there!

Next day- left hotel, visited Manhattanvilee- ok, not great, mostly ghetto kids, academics building reminded me of ""saved by the Bell"" looked like middleschool, icky theatre program, yucky dorms- don't go there.

BARD RULES!!!!!!!

WE then traveled for ages, and went to NYC!!! WOOT WOOT!! Betsy was going phycho, she like wouldn't let us anywhere on our own- a spaz, but Fritz was like, here, have a walkietalkie, go play in Macy's. He's so cool. MAcy's is Tresssss chic. I got a lil blue bag, kawaii. I was sad, I wanted to visit Tiffany's ^_^  If I ever get married, I want a ring from there, and the lil blue boxes- omg i want one!

We missed Kristen and Idina entering the stage doors for their matinee(we were going to the evening) so we were sad, we didn't get kristen's autograph. Then everyone entered this drawing for 25 buck front row seats. Jonathan won!!!!! WOOT WOOT!! So Mariah and I got the front row seats, sitting like 5 feet from Kristen and Idina SOOOOOO COOL. 
Before that, we went to Ellen's Stardust Diner, where the waitresses and waiters sing and preform- pretty cool.

Wicked was superb, amazing, fantastic, breathtaking, so fucking the best musical ever!!! It goes higher in my ranks than Phantom, which I've worshipped for 6 yerars.  The set was gorgeous, very true to the book, with clock gears and a giant Time Dragon at the top (don't know what I'm talking about- READ THE BOOK) The costumes were the best, the plot, the songs, the CHARACTERS. OMG they are sooooooo talented. Idina was beautiful, strong, belting voice, and ""Defying Gravity""- I loved it, she great. I got her signature!!!!!!!!! WOOT WOOT WOOT WOOT!!! And Kristen was... phychooo, cute, bouncy, pink, blonde, adorable, I want to squeeze her- SOOOOOOOO TALENTED, with a 4 octave range- ouch...

I LOVE WICKED!!!!!!!!! I got a KAWAII shirt- you'll have to wait and see it, Mariah did too, tho hers is differnet. We both got giant program/picture books and keychains, and I bought the cd- I already had a burned copy, but I decided I should patronize it cuz I love it so much.

Next day, wnet on th etrain back to Essex VT, very long, but much proffered to the aeroplanes, I don't like airplanes that much.... In the train, I had two seat to just LOUNGe over, no one next to me. I camped out, it was fun. Only the train people kept coming to my seat like every 1/2 an hour to hit on me. I didn't like that, one guy was 40, other guy was like 35, I wanted them to go away. HTe 35 year old was friendlier and nice,. not too creepy, I liked him. THe other was creepy, he like touched my shoulder, would lean too close, had crooked  icky teeth, was bugging me about my drawings, was like, you should enter Miss Vermont, talking to my breasts- WAAAAAAAY YUCKIE!!!!!!! I wish I wasn''t alone, but I was afraid to chew him out, cuz then he'd be more creepy. Maybe he was a pimp in disgusie...Very uncomfortable.

Glad to be home, I missed you all, had a fab time in NYC!!!  If anyone's actually read this far, kuto's to you. Now bored out of my mind, is anyone doing anything?? 434-3723. LOVE YA ALL   (kev, if you have internet access in Bermuda, I miss you and love you and would DIE for an email....)

Au revoir!"

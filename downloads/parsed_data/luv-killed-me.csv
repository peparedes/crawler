"event","<center>SUICIDE

me, myself, and suicide

suicide is a mysterious thing
you'll never no the pain it brings

to the one u love or the ones who loved you

sometimes i wonder,
wonder if he'll care
or if he'll move on like a ride at the fair

please take me away!
away forever...
i want to die, i have no reason to love

maybe if he loved me,
but he dont,
so take the blud i shed
and cherish it forever
and remember me as the girl whoonce loved you

so, this is what im gunna do,

first ill go on like nothings different
second ill start acting weird
third ill ill write to you
fourth you will know
and fifth things will be weird and we wont talk anymore

five simple steps leading to you
and proving you the one
but now your gone...
so this could never happen

so just forget me and that i ever existed
but always remember that i loved you

more than you know

emotional

love makes u very emo
sometimes u wanna play keno
but then u gamble away all your money
then u laugh but it aint funni
the one that loves u is by ur side
but the one u love just hitched a ride
""he"" dont love u babe
so ""he"" just gave
u wanna die and ""he"" dont care
so u go and buy yourself a teddy bear
which should have been from ""him""
but God forbid it be a sin

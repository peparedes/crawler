"event","i wish you knew me
you must like the martha stewart collection a little too much
because you use her first name
i wish you saw me
then maybe you would get your face out of the mirror
the rain makes your blonde...shine, my brown...rats
the frizzy and the impure, the shaded and the broken,
has no place in your sun

you will never see what i see
these colors will never light your way
this world will never take you in
you take yourself away
the breeze must be nice, its your ego expanding around you
you've opened my eyes and i am amazed

must be a thrill to dress the part, you fit the description
behind the shoes, the hair, the eyes
all you have left is a scar
and i'm the broken one? i'm the sinner?
the plank in your eye is causing me to trip, spilling my latte on your 
name brand everything
you don't even know me

the words that i speak fall all over you and you see past me
i'm beautiful in ways that would blind you
manicures and all the right everythings cloud the sky
rain spills with perference 
waves of mercy wash me, you were already clean
well it sure must be nice, it sure must feel good
your mission field is an empty church, mine is the broken street
you will never feel this, never EVER UNDERSTAND

clean hands, pure hearts
you sit in your purity like a queen and no throne is spotless enough
Jesus was right when he called YOU white washed
did He bleed for the righteous? i'm a sinner and i love him more for it
i love the scars that I BEAR
i love the way that i TALK
my cross is lighter than it looks because i don't keep Him on it

crawl and beg, dive and plummet, fall dangerously close to the brimstone
soar above me, looking down, i won't beg for water, all i'll get is that LOOK
the one you give to the less blonde, the less Abercrombie
look, i can't even SPELL what makes you feel worthy
i can't afford what makes you so damn beautiful

hands that wear and labor, feet that swell and ache, eyes that roll and close
weary from a days work, tired of the sin that i wade in, of the drowing corpses i look at every day
its victims bruised and alone you scorn and turn away
well hell, YOUR side of the sun must be too bright for you to see
Jesus is standing in front of you and you pass Him by
surely Jesus shaves? surely he pays 30 bucks a month to tan?

my sin is my pain and HE MADE THE WAY
where is your way? i sure hope you find it
my ugliness is HIS BEAUTY because though i will never be tan, blonde, and clean
He has made me whole, complete, and innocent 
so raise your hand in church and turn your back when the doors swing closed
clean hands pure hearts has made you forever dirty"

"event","sometimes i miss you so much it hurts. it becomes this burning in my throat that i can't seem to swallow. at work, i do my job mechanically and think of you. how you know all about my fear and HATRED of nine to five...minivans and shopping malls. how i don't ever want a normal life and how i feel called by GOd to be more. i smile at customers, nod to my boss, and think of how jealous i am that i can't be there. the people who see you everyday have no idea how lucky they are!! i miss the movies we'd watch on your couch in the basement. how we barely got close enough to touch but i felt you all around me. i miss your smell. the smell that never really went away, even after 7 hours. i wonder if you smell the same? remember the spider that i saw in your basement? (you swear it was just a paint chip but thats because im sure you're secretly afraid of bugs too.)i wonder if the little guy is still there...maybe he thinks about me? he probably thinks you're his personal hero because you saved his life. we'll see NEXT time, you creepy little thing...next time. would you believe i'm actually counting down the days? i'm so stressed OUT and i know talking to you would help me immensely. seriously. you have this still, quiet voice when you let me go on and ON. you say exactly what i need to hear. your voice is so reassuring. it reminds me of the time when i was nine years old i had a REALLY horrible stomach ache late at night; it was one of those that make you want to die, and you feel so weak you don't care if you do. well my mom was there in a heart beat, 2 in the morning, rubbing my back and talking to me in this..voice. it was so reassuring. i knew this pain was incredible but i also had a feeling---my cute little innocent mind--that people all over the world have had stomach aches this bad. so i fell asleep and woke up totally fine.....LOL, you make me fall asleep with a stomach ache!!~~ well the attempt was appreciated i'm sure. ~~ i can't wait to see you again!! the world will not be ready for us, not by a long shot. 
i want white picket fences with you. i told you i didn't, but i really do. it would be awesome. i would even have a garden and yes, mr italian, grape vines everywhere. maybe even IN the fence. that would be irony:) we would make music and make our kids go to sunday school, and sleep in every day! (i'm not sure how the kids would get to school, BUT we're not getting too indepth here.) i miss you so much....~"

"event","In highschool I would be gone every weekend doing something. IN college, I either work, or sit around with friends who also have nothing better to do or no money to find something better to do. Its pretty darn depressing. I went to a Shotgun show this weekend and that was cool....I called off work Saturday and almost got fired....I went to a park with some friends and climbed a tree:) That was cool. Wow. Ok so I actually did do stuff this weekend. But not enough. I feel like I spent most of the time in the car or in my room. AWESOME. I""m really hungry right now....I haven't eaten since like, noon, and its time. All I have in my room is a jar of pickles, packets of oatmeal, and frozen hohos. We have some Ramen too but a YEAR of Ramen is enough for me, thanks. Yeah so I thought about cutting my hair today. Its getting boring at this length...hmm. My friend Jess left her Subway cup here yesterday and I""m looking at it right now. I could go to the bathroom and empty it out, buttttt thats so far away. And its so much work. So Ill prolly look at it a few more days. There's also two cups I need to wash. RAH. I""m so HUNGRY. Subway would be nice. I had a veggie sub yesterday and it was WAY good. Maybe Subway two days in a row would ruin a good thing, you know? I actually worked at a Subway for 2 days and quit. I absolutly hated it. I guess the manager got really mad at me after that and said mean things about me to the whole staff. HA HA.I think my shampoo is making my hair flat and that's NOT cool. It bothers me because if I wear it down it looks flat and i HATE that. YOu know what sounds good right now? Taco Bell...well ok, something a little nicer than Taco Bell. But definately mexican. That would be awesome. Ok. Thats all i got. ~~~~"

"event","I can't believe I've been in college for six months. Its nuts. Like, I remember being in junior high talking to my friends in the bathroom about how ""one day"" we were going to be in ""high school""....then highschool came, we did alot of stupid things, grew up alot--in a few aspects, too fast--and then there was my senior year. So my entire senior year was spent preparing for college; seminars, ACT tests, senior prom...boyfriends...graduation. I had an amazing, incredible summer, and I kept thinking, ""wow this is my last summer before I have to grow up and actually pay attention in classes...."" (LOL I definately do NOT do that.) It's like I went from chillin with some friends in a hot tub to falling asleep in World Today. Its just totally mind numbing!! And the growth process--I'm a different person. I've been dumped TWICE--wow never ever saw that happening--we moved 6 and a half hours away from my home--Ohio!!:)--, I'm really involved in my church's youth group (I""m actually organizing events like lock-ins, summer concerts and ministry opportunities)...I'm leading worship...its just so crazy how you can go from one identity to another in an instant. I went from performing in a showchoir and working at a local YMCA to droppin out of the most elite choir in a private college--Orpheous--and working at a mall....wait, that sounds like a down grade but its really not!! I""m loving this entire experience. I""m not the center of attention, I'm not the most beautiful girl here, I got DUMPED---well, ok, I'm still a little ego-tripping from that, but it wasn't a loss at all--I don't have a million friends....but I'm happy. I got super close to God this semester. I'm closer to my sister...closer to my family. For the first time ever I'm around my extended family--cousins (whats up drewy!!), aunts, uncles, grandparents...WE live on a farm in the middle of nowhere (now) and when I go ""home"" for breaks, I get to wake up to the sun coming out of a field that I can see across for miles and miles. I can't explain it to you and even if I could, you still wouldn't understand. God has changed me in ways I could never ever do it myself. I wanted to be wise, and He is opening my eyes. I wanted to be beautiful and He is showing me that beauty fades--and true beauty comes from accepting that you're indefinatly ugly. HE makes you worthy and beautiful! I wanted to have friends and be funny and charming all the time. HE shows me that I have to seek first HIS righteousness, that I have to please Him above everyone else. I wanted to be brave and He is showing me how weak I am without him....Everything I wanted to be, everything I thought that I was, God has stripped away and exposed the real me. The me without makeup at three in the morning...the me that looks at other girls and compares their bodies to mine...the me that gossips and slanders, the me that always needs attention, the me that is ungrateful because my car isn't new and I don't have the most ""stylish"" clothes....God is this incredible mirror and sometimes it SUCKS. But there's nothing we can do, we're helpless no matter what we do. Maybelline and Express can't cover you; God makes you beautiful, His strength and power is given to our weak bodies and we can do ALL THINGS. I'm learning this every day. Paul says that to follow Christ is to walk daily, to DIE daily, and only then can we be used. I don't know where, when or how it happened, but I began WANTING to be used. I'm a preachers kid, so I know the church talk. I lived it. I know all about the food, the revivals, the hymns, the sermons, the sunday school...the summer camps, the worship music. But what I was lacking for so long was what it really means to accept Jesus Christ as a personal Lord and savior. To understand fully who I am and what I'm about. WEll, I found out who I am...I pretty much suck. No matter what I do, I fall short. And I fall hard....a lot. 2 Thousand years ago a man came down and died for me, and here I am, putting on make-up and wondering what I'll be when I ""grow up""....He knew He would be rejected, pushed aside, spit on, beaten beyond recognition. He knew I would profess him one day, and deny Him the next. He knew we would all do that. Our worship to him isn't a millionth of what he deserves, not even close, but he HUNG on a cross and died. No one knows why. His love for me is still impossible to fathom. WHy? What did I do? What could I do? Nothing. My best is as filthy rags to him. (Thats what the Bible says anyway...) So I guess thats where I am. Amazed by my God and where He's taken me. I wanted deeper and now I guess I""m leaving the shallow end. And I want it no other way."

"event","My dad has been a pastor since I was five years old, and if its one thing I know alot about, it's the church. Baptist church to be specific. Today I dragged some fellow Olivetians--however the heck you spell that--to my dads church, and it struck me as I was sitting there, that some things never change. I remember when my parents were going to Florida Baptist Theological College--FBTC--back in like, '92, my dad had pastored a small Baptist church. THis church was something straight out of a movie. It took about 25 minutes to get there from the campus; through dirty, humid side roads--we lived in Northern Florida, a few hours south of Georgia, so everything looked dirty--and eventually we ended up in this remote wood. We had to drive down dusty, sometimes muddy, little roads--curving and twisting--no houses in sight--until we reached a little building across from a small cemetary about fifty yards from a mobile home. Hello church. Everything about this church kind of set the standard in my 8 year old mind for all other churches I would visit and join for a long time. The music was hymns, ALWAYS. Our music leader was a 70 year old man who would prop his leg up on a stool to direct the choir--his name was ERnest. (His wife played the out of tune piano.)Those songs I knew like the back of my hand....since moving NOrth, people may sing the same ones, but they never sound the same. (You need that kind of off pitch, twangy, ""Thou-a shall-a nowt beeee moooved""...)
                  The best thing about being a pastors kid in the south was that every Sunday, you were invited to eat lunch with a family. And every family competed for who got the pastors' family. They would also compete for who made the best food. OH my gosh no one cooks like southerners!!! Fried chicken, collard greens, potato salad, mashed potatoes,field peas,Real tea--oh theres definatly fake tea, you probably drink it--and like 50 types of pie. YEAH. It's amazing I wasn't three hundred pounds.
             Eventually we moved up north, I lost the accent..no more southern food either. But baptist churches still have this smell--its like age, stale old perfume and dusty hymnals. 
            WOW this was way too long. Just some random thoughts I thought I'd share for you simple minded Nazarenes. HA, jk.:)"

"event","<FONT color=#000099>So I just don't understand why people debate with me! During lunch, all I want to do is sit and stare off into space and EAT. I usually am running off to class and need chill time to just be a bum and stare off. Anyone can see that I have no interest in debating deep, passionate issues like President Bush--who by the way, is the greatest pres. ever--gay marriages---which by the way, I do not support--and eternal security of the believer--which by the way, I totally believe in. Well interestingly enough, each one of these issues were brought up today. Keep in mind that when you debate with Holly, you will probably end up offended and frustrated. I don't think that my extreme opinions and views---which oddly enough are usually right--is a bad thing. Just watch out. So my lunch was interupted and a debate was thrown up in the air. (Darn, I had to slip out of A.D.D. mode and actually function.) Also keep in mind that I was actually thrown out of a class in highschool a few different times because I debated so hard. I had the teacher all ticked off and I refused to back down. Hey, I'm passionate about things! Music, movies, God--wow nice priorities--love, relationships, POLITICS. YOu bring something up, ask my opinion, expect an opinion. I""m alot better than I used to be though. I would actually get pumped up going in to that class in highschool! (I had a Jewish teacher who tried to argue the Bible with me--a pastors daughter--and a class room full of liberal minded schmucks who would cut and bleed for any social organization, especially the inner city leeches who sit around all day sucking up the welfare money while their children go to college for FREE...)So anyway, after this lunch discussion I felt very much alive and mostly an idiot for jumping the gun so much. I have this annoying habit of interupting people, not really listening to what they say, disrespecting them for not agreeing with me, and shutting them down the minute they say it. Maybe its a character flaw, maybe it adds to my charm--HA, jokkkeee--but sometimes I get out of line. So this is sortof an ""I'm sorry I'm right""...WAIT, LOL, ok no really. TO whoever debated with me today, you know who you are, I AM SORRY. And you better copy and paste that because you'll never see it again. WEll unless I feel convicted again and have to write it publically to redeem myself. </FONT>"

"event","So lets talk Valentines day. Lets talk about cute couples sitting in the ONU cafeteria together, holding hands, making plans for the BIG NIGHT...probably a movie, dinner--unless of course, the guy is completely broke and has no car--in which case, they'll probably go to the Common Grounds coffee place here on campus and look at eachother. Awesome.Why does this day irritate me so much? Well its simple really. Valentines day for me will be me and my friend Jessica sitting in her apartment watching movies. Oh, we'll probably have some guys over, but not nessesarily the ""right kind"" of guys. Not the Valentines day kind. She'll make some food, we'll eat it, laugh at whatever we happen to be watching. Fun times, yes. But on Valentines Day? Shouldn't there be some guy--um excuse me, MAN--with a super nice car, with a super nice bouquet of flowers, waiting outside my dorm window? Shouldn't we be the ones sitting in the cafeteria making plans? (Wait, that didn't actually make a whole lot of sense...) I guess not. I can deal with popcorn, homemade cookies and a boy-bashing fest. Seriously. (Do I seem convincing? I""m saying it right now outloud; ""I can deal--"" It sounds honest enough.):) It just makes all the single girls--or women, whatever--here feel like crap. ""So what are you doing on Valentines day?"" .... ""Um, you know. CHillin."" Then there are those girls who pretend they don't want a boyfriend. The ones that go to the bathroom in fleets, plan their weddings with other girls on their floor, look through magazines and cut out hot guys to decorate their dorm with. They look around at the decorations and at the gossip table at lunch--unabandoned still from the cruel world of higschool--they roll their eyes and shrug over the cuteness of the couples. I hear them say stuff like, ""Wow, he's actually dating her?"" When what they really want to say is, ""Wow, I've spent all my time with the same 15 girls and I know exactly the type of braidsmaid dresses I want...hey Im pretty lonely."" Who wants to admit to that? I'll admit to being ok single--ok with being one of 10 Olivet students who isn't engaged or saving up for a wedding dress. Valentines Day just...you know? {Sigh} Well, thats all I got. Latah:)"

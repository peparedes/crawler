I work at coldstone now. I know, 2 pizza places, albertsons, my dads 2 companies (Valens/SCC, but I still work there) and now Coldstone.

It's fun. The first 2 days we're hard, but now it's easy and I can see myself liking this job. I also realized that I need a job to stay grounded. I could write a long drawn out explanation of how a job keeps me grounded, but i'll just leave it at that. It's a good thing ;)

I partied pretty much every night of this week, and i'm still chugging along. BBQ + Brew at Troy's tonight with Chris, who is sick.

Heading out in a few minutes, then working 7pm-11pm tomorrow. Visit me and i'll make you some dankealicious ice cream. No discounts unless you're immediately family you punks."

Gotta leave my house by 10am to get to Irvine, carpooling with 3 friends from there, arrive at the gates around 1:30-2pm. Gates open at 4pm. 6 stages of talent, along with a full blown assortment of carnival rides, all free with admission. Party as hard as I possibly can until 2am when the gates close, then we carpool back to Irvine. I'll probably return to my truck around 4am, drive home and get home around 5am, possibly a bit later.

"event","I'm planning on going to the following shows. If any of you want to join me, reply to this bulletin and you can give me cash and i'll buy you a ticket. No ride? No problem. I can fit 4 including me. And if we get someone to go who has transportation, they can haul more people if they want to.

June 24th - As I Lay Dying + Etched In Red, SOMA.
June 29th - Bane, The Epicentre
June 30th - Warped Tour, Coors Amphitheatre
July 16th - Alkaline Trio + Death By Stereo, SOMA

We've got about 5-6 people going to The Warped Tour. It's going to be huge. I think we're taking about 3 cars, and I know when June 30th rolls around more people are going to want to go. Come join us for the biggest event of the summer. Tickets are probably going to be about $35-40 at the gate, but worth every penny. Pre-Sale is still going I believe.

For As I Lay Dying on the 24th, I found out about this show a few weeks ago and sort of forgot about it until I got an E-Mail from the SOMA mailing list. I know for sure I want to go, i'm sure my brother will come, let me know if you wanna join us. $13.

Anyone wanna go to see Bane on the 29th at The Epicentre? It would be a good warmup show before the Warped Tour the next day. Only $12.00. Let me know. For anyone not firmiliar with Bane, it's Boston Hardcore at it's finest, and they've been around over a decade. They sound like Hopesfall, Atreyu, From Autumn To Ashes, Killswitch Engage, etc...

Have a listen:

And last but not least, July 16th. I'll be going to see The Alkaline Trio at SOMA with my brother. Buying tickets soon. $22. So far it's Me, Doug, and my brother. Join us."

"event","Just got back from my interview. I was a little nervous, but it was easy. The managers there are the definition of chill. I met with the guy who was training for the manager position at the Quarry Creek store, and the manager from the El Camino Real store. I knew this wasnt gonna be like Albertsons when he walked up and greeted me with a ""Whats up bro"". All in all, I think it's safe to say I got the job, just dont know at which store. Probably Marron Rd. We'll see.

Eitherway I get to work with people I know. Nicole (who i've known for 6 years) works at the El Camino Real store. And so does that tall girl that went to the Underoath concert. I'd be perfectly content working with Seth though. Seth is chill as hell, him and Chris used to roll one during their lunch break and smoke it behind blockbuster. 

Eitherway, I just need money. Wages are $7.00 /hr, plus tips (usually $1-2 hr. cash). No union dues. No asshole bosses. And the music is pretty cool. 

Although I had a bit of an embarassing moment. The music was playing during the first 5 minutes of my interview, and some generic hip hop/r&b song comes on and all of a sudden I hear a cowbell. I had to hold back a smirk, cowbell in a R&B song? Then it happened. I sware over everything that is holy the girl in the song began to sing:

Gobble gobble gobble...
Gobble gobble gobble...

All the while, the cowbell is being beaten like a redheaded stepchild. I lost it, right then and there. She asked me what was funny, and I had to explain. She found it hillarious, which was good.

Doug's birthday is tomorrow. Fuck yes. Fuck yes. Happy 19th Duderino."

Icebox. Theres this cute girl that works there, and whenever I go in
(usually daily during the lunch hour on my days off) i'm wearing one of
my many band T-Shirts. I came in today in my work Uniform and she
sighed and told me she was dissapointed that I wasnt wearing a band
shirt today. She said she always gets excited when my truck pulls up
because i'm one of the nicer regulars. I thought that was pretty damn
cool.<br>
<br>
Then I came home, played uber amounts of WoW, and then went to In &amp;
Out with Alexa. Then I dropped her off, and saw that Jon Soderman dude
from the News sitting in a van parked by Alexa's house. I thought that
was cool. Then I went downtown and hung out with Jenn &amp; Doogle.
Then I went to Doogles and we enjoyed a few cigars. I think i've found
my favorite long-smoke medium body cigar. Just the right amount of
spice, and very tasty. Almost cinamon, but with plenty of cedar mixed
in. Enjoyable night. <br>
<br>
Doug is off tomorrow, and so am I. So we've vowed to not waste the
opportunity and hang out tomorrow. We actually got some pretty sweet
plans. Gonna go to lunch at Hooters around noon. Hang out til 2:30,
perhaps hit up the Cigar Store. Doug and I were talking about splitting
a 20 pack of the cigar I just talked about. Then go pick up Jenn, and
hang out with her. Probably downtown. Then we are going shopping and
getting stuff for a BBQ. Corn on the cob, potato's, the good stuff.
Then we're all gonna head to I think Doug's and grill the steaks that
Andrew is gonna bring home from work when he gets off @ 5. Porter
House, New York Ribeye, Fillet Mignon. Good stuff. Cant wait.<br>
<br>
I've never really found a band that i've REALLY liked, like alot. I
found that with Senses Fail. I cant wait to see them live. Let It
Enfold You, and their EP is just awesome. I could listen to both
non-stop, and pretty much do that with a little bit of Pennywise and
Anti-Flag thrown in there. <br>

"event","My 5, 10, and maybe 15 year plan:

www.valensusa.com

That's my dads new business. LED lights. Now, some of you may be thinking ""What the fuck? How can you make money from an LED light"". Well, i'll tell you. Right now my dad has about $80,000 (wholesale) worth of product sitting in a warehouse he just bought. He's got 30 sales reps who his business partner brought on when they became partners, and an excel spreadsheet of 2500 buyers. The demand for LED lights in bulk, is like the demand for any other cheap product bought in bulk. Example:

My dad just signed a huge contract with Fleetwood RV in Corona, CA. Fleetwood is a huge RV Manufacturer, and they want to buy all the LED's for their RV's directly from us. Being that they manufancture a ridiculous amount of RV's each year. That means we are going to be shipping them alot of product. And that's only ONE of 2500 buyers. Obviously one of the biggest on our list, but the little guys make us bucks too.

I'll be quitting Albertsons in about 1 month, and officially becoming an employee of ValensUSA about a week later. I'll commute each day (2 hrs roundtrip) to Corona to work for my dad. It's going to be great. And i'll be making significantly more money. Also, about a year from now when I know the business like my dad does, i'll be a sales rep like him. He flys around the country (and sometimes internationally) marketing product. Except this time, instead of doing it for some company he works for, he's doing it for himself. My Dad knows sales too, he's been in sales nearly 30 years. But when I become a sales rep (bling), I wont be travelling internationally. I'll be working closely with the SoCal market, and travelling around Southern California meeting with vendors, buyers and other sales reps. 

This business has huge potential, and my dad has the knowledge and connections to make this huge. I cant wait.

Obligattory ""Ya, i'm workin with my dad now"" refference now fulfilled. <3 Andrew"

Pneumonia != Death

I've been out of commission for a week. When I mean out of commission, I mean no work, phone, computer, friends, limited family. No outside. Nothing. In bed, with your remote, barf bucket, inhalor, and thats that. I was in and out of the hospital a 2 times, but i'll spare the details. They're boring. 

Today was my first day out of the house since the 13th. It felt weird driving, and I drove wicked slow. It's cool though. I feel much better, and I can actually eat now. The cool thing about not eating was that I lost 14 lbs. and it's inspired me to diet. So i'm gonna diet. I also learned that greasy foods really do fuck up my face with acne, so I decided i'm gonna do away with those. My face cleared up alot this week.

Went in and talked to Doug today. Was good to talk to him. I think I take our friendship for granted sometimes, and I missed that fucking douche. Had lunch with Andrew, and then saw Kari briefly at Albertsons. It was cool to see people. Going to see more of them tonight.

I'm gonna take it easy the next couple days, and get back to work JUST in time for the weekend. Start back Saturday afternoon.

I also got 11 shirts in the mail. It was sweet. I should have ordered one at a time, cause now I want to wear them all at once and I cant.

Bella called me, she really needs me to work tomorrow, and despite the fact that i'd love nothing more then to sit at home and play WoW all day, it's probably better I get out of the house and go to work.

"event","I've been too fucking busy to update this piece of shit. But now that I have the time, i'll go ahead and do so simply because I have nothing better to do.

For lack of a better term, the shit has hit the fan with my brother. His vitals are at an all time low, he's not eating, and he's lost a TON of weight. And that's saying alot for this skinny kid. I think he only weighs a buck 50 healthy, he's down to 125. He has trouble breathing, he cant sleep, he sweats at night. Basically, he's feeling the full effects of cancer since it went untreated for so long. This is a bit of a 180 considering that Monday, we drove up to Orangewood Foster Care, signed all his papers, my grandmother became his legal guardian, and we came home. I took him to Albertsons, I bought him $30 worth of food, he met some of my coworkers, then he came home and passed out from pure exhaustion. Didnt eat any of the food. Oh well. Next morning I woke up, and my grandma and brother were gone. She left me the car, she left me $60, and called to tell me she'd be back Saturday. I went to work, and that was that. Then Tuesday afternoon I got the news he had been admitted to City Of Hope. City Of Hope is amazing, they deal with Cancer patients day in and day out, and they're only staffed with veteran doctors. They have pathologists and oncologists on staff, who deal exclusively with Adult Hodgkins Lymphoma.

Anyways, he was admitted Tuesday morning on an emergency basis. They stabilized his vitals, and found out his blood pressure was dangerously low. Then after a few hours, they started the tests. Poor guy was like a guinea pig. CBC (Complete Blood Count), BMB (Bone Marrow Biopsy, basically they take a needle, shove it into your spine, and extract bone marrow. Or, in simpler terms, a Spinal Tap). My brother looks like a heroin addict with all the IV tract marks. They're struggling to diagnose him (he's still only been diagnosed, but not completely, there are over 20 different specific types of Hodgkins and 6 different stages). And they cant treat him until he is diagnosed. Meaning, he is going to be very sick from the cancer itself, then once he is diagnosed he is going to start chemotherapy, and chemotherapy = several months of pure torture. I cant imagine how my brother feels. 

I know how I feel though. Horrible. Work has been harder than ever with this whole situation lingering in the back of my head. So I did what any sane person would do, I stopped working. Atleast for the rest of the week. I need to get my head on straight, relax, drive up and visit my brother, and spend some time with friends who will be able to take my mind off this fucking mess. 

And now to my rant. Fuck you Bella. Heartless bitch.

I'm not asking for much. 2 days off of work. 2 fucking days. I train all your day-shift new hires, I've never missed a sweep, the lots always clear when i'm on carts, and I do everything other people dont (trash, recycle bin, spills, carryouts, you name it...). I dont ask for much. It's my fucking job, and it's a cake one at that. But when I exercise good work ethic, I expect her to do the same. And she didnt. I called to explain her situation to me. I dont want sympathy. I want understanding, and cooperation. She gave me neither. She said she'd ""Deal with the fact"" that i'm shorting her one person. Get over it you bitch, my brother is in the fucking hospital half dead. 

Luckily Doug explained it to Serena who understood completely. I even talked to her on Dougs cell phone. 

Some people just arent playing with a full deck. I'm off to go sleep."

"event","Brother has Cancer.

Biopsy results are back, and we feared the worst, and got the worst.

Adult Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Cancer of his lymphnodes.

Quote:
Hodgkin's disease is a type of lymphoma -- a cancer that develops in the lymph system. The lymph system is the body's main defense against infections. It includes lymph nodes -- bean-shaped organs that produce germ-fighting white blood cells -- as well as the spleen, the thymus (a small gland in the middle of the chest), the tonsils, and a network of vessels that carry white blood cells throughout the body. Hodgkin's disease usually first appears in the lymph nodes above the collarbone or in the center of the chest, but all parts of the lymph system can be affected.


He has all the symptoms. He got mono because his white blood cell count is extremely low as a result of the cancer. And the mass was also found in his chest. Doctors said they expected this, but didnt want to let anyone onto it incase it was a fluke and he didnt have Hodgkins. He will be treated with Chemotherapy, starting tomorrow. He is terrified. He knows he is going to lose his hair, and experience the horror that is Chemo.

I took the day off work and i'm going gonna go back up there again today to be with him. 

More details as they come."

quitting. Got off, and went home and changed. Met up with Kari and
Jasmine and Cameron and Christi. Went to Vinakas, sat and talked. Then
Doug and Kari and I went and walked around. Kari molested me by the

animosity and huffyness ensued. After wondering what the deal was, I

"event","Wow, lots going on. 

1. Got a free car. Should be coming soon. Long story short, Grandmas friend has a car she's giving to my grandma to give to me. She owes my grandma a favor.  I will keep the car for ~6 months and then sell it when I have enough for a NICE car.

2. Brother is in the hospital, and a ward of the state. Again, another long story short, he got kicked out of the house about 5 months ago, and since then he's been living house to house. His school found out, and CPS got involved. They took him from school in a squad car, and to a state controlled ward while he waited for his case to be seen in court. When he was there, he kept complaining of chest pains so they took him to his General Practicioner. The GP sent him to get an MRI and Catscan, and they found a 35cm mass below his left pectoral muscle near his heart. Turns out it's a possibly cancerous tumor. This is another downfall of not being in a fucking stable home. You're so worried about living house to house, that you neglect your own health and shit like this goes unnoticed for months. He met with the surgeon today, and they gave him a morphine drip for his pains. They gave him a heavy dosage when he first came in, and he got such a high that he fell out of his bed. That made me die laughing. My brother hates drugs and alcohol, but he said, and I quote, ""The room was spinning like a dreidel. It was fucking cool man"". He's probably having surgery tomorrow. Surprisingly i'm content with all of this. Not overly worried at all, just concerned. I'll drive up Sunday and bring him lollipops and shit. 

Now for my day.

Woke up at 7. Shower, usual junk. Worked 8-5. At work, my posse visited me while on a sweep. Jackie noticed that I had a mob of people around me while doing my sweep, so she got on the PA and said ""Attention all associates on aisle 9, please let David finish his sweep, thank you"". That was pretty funny, and this is coming from someone who rides a broom to work. Good stuff.

Doogle and I had the usual fun at work. An ungodly amount of breaks and bullshitting while on the clock. 

After work I got the car and picked up Doug. We went to California Dreamin, some clothing outlet with cheap Dickies. Jawsome. I got a nice Dickies belt, but it's a pain to put on. I hate new leather. Then we went over to Kohls. I got a shirt, a pair of pants, and some undershirts. Fucking studly. Doug photographed me while I was changing in the changing rooms. Fucking pervert.

Then we went to EB Games. Doug traded in some games, and got GT4. I've hooked him. This weekend we're gonna get a LAN cable, and an extra TV and set it up in his room. Then we're gonna veg out and race our sweet ass whips. 

Then we went to Del Taco. Doug had 8 tacos, I had 6. It was righteous. I took him home and then came home and watched some special on TLC about Area 51."

<br>
Went to work at 11. 4 new hires, schnap. The usual suspects friend from
school, Heather. Then a service deli dude, and another bagger, and
another, and then a janitor. Hah. <br>
&nbsp; Gonna be training alot of new people, but not tomorrow. They're
giving me tomorrow off, and working me Saturday. So much for visiting
my dad. fhqwgads.<br>
<br>
Then I worked my ass off and hung about 500 MDA fundraiser clovers.
That involved stapling, stringing together, then hanging them all. Took
me all day, off and on, on top of 3 hours of carts and multiple sweeps.
It's nice being the go-to guy with important tasks, but sometimes they
overestimate my desire to multi-task. I cant complain though, my
supervisors and I have a great work relationship when they arent
contradicting eachother like morons.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
Boss 1: Hey, can you clear the lot?<br>
Me: Sure<br>
&lt;5 mins later&gt;<br>
Boss 2: Hey, can you cover the front end?<br>
Me: mm...ok<br>
&lt;5 mins later&gt;<br>
Boss 1: WTF MATE, CLEAR THE LOT <br>
Me: ....antelope....<br>
<br>
I think I scare Bella when I say antelope, so I stopped doing that.
Whenever she calls me in the front, I used to always answer the phone
with a really chipper ""ANTELOPE?!?!"" and she'd always pause, sigh, and
then tell me what she called to tell me. It's sad when I have to resort
to using the term antelope excessively at work to keep myself
entertained. Not to bash antelopes, they're cool as shit. Keeping
entertained at work is important though. I used to just go into the
dairy box and drink OJ with Doug, but OJ is overrated and I stopped
that. Holy tangent batman, back on topic.<br>
<br>
I got off work. Hung out for 2 hours, shooting the shit. Then Doug clocked out and I drove him home.<br>
<br>
Still waiting on my free car. It's coming before the weeks end. For now I leave you with a random picture off my phone.<br>

Had a few calls from MR2 owners, but didnt return them because I cant test drive the cars because I cant drive stick yet. GAH! I think i'm gonna pay to have my mom rent a stick shift car, and learn on that or something. This is just getting ridiculous.

Went and gave the car back to my mom at 12. Then came home and showered. Sat around watching scrubs, chatted on the phone, spammed. Finally 7pm rolls around, half a season of scrubs later, and Kari comes to pick me up. Jenn and Doug are already in the car and we head to Christi's. We pick up Christi, who crams into the backseat with us. It was pretty uncomfortable. Jello isnt a fun game. Christi informs me my hair smells like a supermarket for animals. I was immensely flattered. We arrived downtown, and went into Vanakas and grabbed a table. 

Got a text from Brian, he needed to talk. Spent about 20 minutes on the phone with him. He's between a rock and a hard place, and i'm gonna wire him several hundred dollars. Poor kids 17 and he's living house to house. Looks like the housing manager at his current apartment found out the people he's staying with arent his parents/guardians. Kid needs to get emancipated so he doesnt get sent back into the foster care system. Fucking mess. Oh well, he's got good friends and me to fall back on. 
  

Came back inside. Christi took a bunch of pictures. We chatted as usual. Ran into a bunch of people. Some kid Christi knows named Ian came and joined us. He was really quiet. We decided to go to Denny's. Doug tried to win a stuffed scooby doo with bunny ears while we waited for our table. $3 and no profit. We sat down and I had the Super Bird, no tomato. It was good. Then Cameorn joined us. Then we left, and drove Ian home. Then we dropped Jenn at Coyote's where her mom was jazzercising the night away. Kari blew through a red light cause we were busy discussing the idea of a guy named Spanky Spangler starring in a porn called the Star Spangled Banger. Sometimes I wonder where I come up with this shit. 
  
Then we took the 78 home. Off the Melrose exit, a CHP Officer was pulling over some blonde chick in a Ferrari. Sweetness. I got dropped off and now i'm listening to *gasp* The Shins. Gonna do the usual. Scrubs, SNL, then bed."

Called 5 people with late 80's model MR2's for sale in the autotrader. They all look good, and there are a few I really like. Hopefully they'll call me back today (Saturday) so I can head out and take a look at them. Too bad I cant DRIVE them because I dont know how to drive stick. GAH! I need to learn. Desperately. I was gonna learn on Brandons truck, but he's back in Georgia. Oh well, i'll figure something out.

In other news, today went a little like this. Woke up at 11am. Sat in bed and stared at the walls, not turning off my alarm clock for 30 minutes. Just sat there and listened to Flake (I set my alarm clock to play the CD when I wake up). It was really relaxing. Got up, showered , and headed off to work. Worked 12-6. Got my schedule. Fuckers gave me a 5am shift. I told Bella flat out I didnt want anymore. She asked why, and I made up the excuse of not being able to drive between 12am-5am on my provisional, but I felt like screaming ""BECAUSE I NEED SLEEP YOU MINI HITLER, SIG HEIL!!!"". Gotta pay my union dues by March 4th or they will stop scheduling me and eventually terminate me. <rant> There's nothing more unappealing then having to PAY $200 to a worthless union, so that I can keep my job and continue working. GAH. Then they gank an additional $9 each week from my paycheck. They're supposed to stop the man from screwing us, but they ARE the man. </rant>

Got off at 6. Went home. Whored AutoTrader. Showered. Burned Chutes Too Narrow. Went to Albertsons. Met up with Doogle and Andrew. Kari and Alexa came out of the store. We all drove to Vinakas, except Kari, she sort of smashed the pedal to the floor and tryed to break some kind of land speed record. She came close. We met up with Jenn and Meg. Chatted. Then Christi and Cameron showed up. Had a good chat with Cameron about his MR2, and his previous ride, an old Torino. Kari, Doug, Alexa, and Jenn all took off downstairs and went and did something. I stayed and chatted with Cameron and the group. Then they came back, and Christi and Cameron peaced out. We stayed for awhile longer then went to Denny's. I had some pie. Kari and Jenn had kids meals (lol), and Doogle and Meg had nothing. Then we all went to Kari's and sat in her driveway. Jenn and I made forts with our blankets while Doug and Kari dryhumped. I made an awesome cape and ran around in the middle of the street with my arms outstretched. That was fun as hell. Then I drove Jenn and Doug home. Now i'm gonna do guess what....CMON...if anyone out there reads this damn thing they know I watch Scrubs before I go to bed. Peace."

"event","Woke up at 7. Showered, drove to work. Worked 8-5. Saw Kari. Got my check. Got off work. Went home. Showered, changed, watched some Scrubs. Picked up Doug. Went to Jenns. Picked up Alexa. Went to Chilli's. Had food. Dropped everyone off at Jenns. Drove home. Watched The Apprentice. And now it's current time.

Today sort of sucked. I was planning on heading to see the car today, and I called the lady and she SOLD the fucking car even though she had promised me it was mine for the taking. Gah!

Back to AutoTrader.com for me. The weekend is 1 day away. Thank god..."

"event","Woke up, showered, and went into work at 8. Worked until 5. Ran into
someone in the locker room, and sparing the details, pretty much blew
up at them. Wrong person to run into at the end of a 9 hour shift. <br>
<br>
Came home, felt guilty and slept it off. And now here I am, listening to Frou Frou. <br>
<br>
I called the lady about her MR2. CarFaxED the VIN. The thing is clean as a whistle.<br>
<br>
It's a 1985 TOYOTA MR2, 5 spd. It's only got 130,000 miles, has all
recent services, strong engine, body &amp; mechanical are in good
condition, and it includes a $450.00 alpine stereo/cd. AWESOME! They're
asking $1499 obo, but if I show up with $1300 in cash i'm sure they
cant refuse. Now all I have to do is learn stick. If anyone has a car
with a manual transmission, and some free time, and wants to teach me,
give me a call PLEASE. I have to learn stick, and SOON!<br>

That thing is pure sex. It's a mid-engine, rear wheel drive car. Which
means, that the engine is behind the seats, but before the end of the
car, giving you a small amount of trunk space in the rear. The engine
sits near the cars center of gravity, making it <br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Easy to stop</li>
  <li>Easy to accelerate</li>
  <li>Great at cornering</li>
  <li>And great handling</li>
</ul>
Which means it's going to be one HELL of a fun ride. The 1.6L, 4
Cylinder engine is more than adequate for a car this size, and should
put out plenty of torque to get you off the line in a jiffy. Not to
mention, I can save $450 since this car comes pre-loaded with a Pioneer
Headunit/Stereo. AWESOME!<br>
<br>
If this car is as good as it seems, then I think i've found the car
i've been working my ass off for this past year. I'll hopefully get a
call back tomorrow at work, and arrange to check it out tomorrow after
work. I'd take it for a test drive, but I dont know how to drive stick.
Hrmph :(<br>
<br>
Gonna go watch Scrubs, and then go to sleep. My usual routine. Night night.<br>"

"event","Blargh. Today sucked.

First and foremost. Someone who I thought was a friend is avoiding me entirely, and has been doing so for the past 3-4 days. That's fine, two can play this game. If you dont want to be friends, or are too scared to confront me, that's cool. But by all means dont expect me to keep making the effort. I'm tired of the shitty feeling in the pit of my stomach. It's not worth it, and either are you. Consider me written off. Anyways...

Woke up at 10am for an 11am shift. I was tired as hell, and felt like crap. Sort of like I got hit by a truck. So I called in sick. Ya, poor work ethic, but I didnt feel like working when I felt like that. So I slept until 3, rolled out of bed and showered. Then Jenn and Kari felt the need to give me the skinny on some stuff. Ya, that was fun. Then I went and crawled into bed and slept for another hour. Then I watched some Scrubs. Missed my episode on TV, cause I was busy watching Season 2 on my computer..lol. I'll just download it anyways. Then I sat at the computer and did nothing. 

Then about 11pm I got bored. So I called Jenn and went over and picked her up. She was wearing her jammies and awesome plaid glasses. I was flattered that she got all dolled up for our late night escapades. We mostly drove around, and then went to In & Out, where we always end up. I'm gonna get even fatter if I keep going there. Anyways, we talked about people...

Then we went back and parked in front of her house and listened to music and talked about random shit. Then I started the drive home. She was worried as hell I was going to get into an accident, but I promised i'd drive slow.

By now it was POURING, and the damn car wouldnt defrost. And even with the windshield wipers on full blast, it was still a blur. Luckily, I got the car mildly defrosted and the rain started to let up.

I was almost home free, about 5 minutes from my house when it happened. I was cruising along, doing 20 in a 35, playing it very safe. When *BAMF* I hit a enormous puddle and feel the car lurch, I dont turn the wheel, I keep it straight and try to ride through. I take my foot off the accelerator, and I dont brake so I can avoid losing control. When I got through the massive puddle, It had turned the car sideways, and I was traveling at an angle and felt the backend slide out. I corrected a little bit and the car was back in the right direction, for a split second. The lincoln is a fucking beast, and the weight of the car straightening itself out, and the wheels regaining traction sends the backend flying back out and there was no coming back from this one. I slam on the brakes, crank the wheel, and brace for impact. I hit a curb, pop up OVER the curb, and slide in the mud about 10 feet until I come to a rest INCHES from an overflowing creek with a 6 ft. drop.

Holy fuck. My heart was pounding. I throw open the door, examine all tires, and survey for damage. Tires are inflated, rims are not bent, and theres no body damage. Fuck yes, I may be able to cover this up without gram gram knowing. So with the door open (oops) I put the beast into reverse and give it some gas. I have a tiny bit of traction, so I give it more gas. The tires spin and I make it back up onto the sidewalk and slowly reverse back onto the street.

I pull to a lit street to doublecheck everythings alright. Thats when I notice that reversing with the door open = mud all over. My whole door panel was covered in mud. @%&*@!!!!

I drive to a gas station, doing about 10mph the whole way, and spend about 30 minutes wiping down the door. I did an awesome job, and you couldnt tell there was mud there if you sat and stared for eternity.

Now here I am, home, safe.

I've gotta get up in 5 hours for work, and with the amount of adrenaline I just had dumped into me I cant imagine falling asleep anytime soon. Looks like i'm gonna pull an all nighter and then work my 8am-5pm shift as a zombie.

Yay..."

"event","Woke up at 9am. Power was out. Set alarm on phone. Went back to sleep.
Woke up, turned my phone volume up, scratched my butt and rolled out of
bed and bamf, Kari calls me. Forgot what we talked about. Went online.
Talked to Kari and listened to more music. Which reminds me, I need to
get an iPod. Then I hopped in the shower and went to work. <br>
&nbsp; Worked 2:00-6:45. Fucking weak. Mikey let me get off fifteen
minutes early. Saw Kari, Jasmine, Christi, Cameron at work. Kari and I
chatted briefly about tonight. Jasmine is having more Christi &amp;
Cameron time. Kid seems to enjoy it, more power to her. I better get
some damn Jasmine time this week though.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; Came home. Changed shoes, shirt, and went to Jenn's. Parked. Sat
in Kari's car listening to the Garden State Soundtrack (woot). Kari
&amp; Doug madeout. We went downtown. Went to Vinakas. Ran into Jas,
Christi, Cameron. Jenn was being weird. We went to the gazebo. Sat
down, talked. I mostly sat there humming the tune to Blue Eyes. As we
were leaving, Jasmine came to see Lucy. Then we drove her the 30 feet
to Starbucks. Then her and Jenn argued about something stupid,
thrusting me into the middle of it. No tact...<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; Then we went to Denny's. Sat down. I left cause I wanted to get
home to my homework, among other things. Hopped in the car. Discovered
why the radio doesnt work, the antenna doesnt go up when I start the
car. So I have to manually do it. It's a small price to pay for music
in the car. I swung by Starbucks again to try and find Jasmine, I
needed to talk to her. Couldnt find her. Saw Camerons cool MR2,
contemplated ditching Lucy and stealing his car and going to Mexico,
but decided against it as the jailtime for Grand Theft Auto is kind of
long. <br>
<br>
&nbsp; And now here I am. Here is tonights playlist.<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Bright Eyes</li>
  <li>Frou Frou</li>
  <li>Garden State Soundtrack</li>
  <li>Flake <br>
  </li>
  <li>The Shins (Both Albums)</li>
</ul>
The Ultimate Fighter is on tonight at 11:05. Chris and Josh are gonna duke it out. Should be a good fight.<br>
UFC Episode 5 is on tonight. <br>

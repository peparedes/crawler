John Michael decided that he HAD to make a cheesecake today. We both watched ""Good Eats"" on the food network a couple of nights ago (one of those rare moments that we actually get along) and the episode was on cheesecake. It probably won't come out right though b/c you're suppose to mix it in a KitchenAid mixer with a paddle attachment, and since we only have a hand mixer, it doesn't come with a paddle attachment.
Oh, well its his loss."

Went to Raymond (LOL) Saturday morning for the state swim meet at Hinds CC. Maggie kicked ass as usual. She won two of her heats. Makos dominated as always. We had 42 swimmers competing, the next largest team brought 18.

Babysat Saturday night for the Barnettes, it felt like I was there forever, but the pay was good.

Sunday, I didn't do a damn thing other than clean my room. I rented ""Lost In Translation"" but they only had it in VHS and the downstairs VCR was screwed up and the only other one we have is in John Michael's room, so needless to say I never got to watch it.

I've gotten pretty good at this knitting stuff. I can knit AND purl now... oooOOoo go me! I have two sets of needles so I'm knitting a bright blue chenille scarf and a purple wool scarf.

I had my 6 month check-up at my neurologist yesterday for my epilepsy. Everything was fine except that I had to get 3 tubes of blood taken to check various stuff and the nurse that did it made my arm bruise. I also had to get a vitamin B-12 injection but my favorite nurse there did that so it was okay. I had a horrible headache also so I just went home afterwards and went to bed.

A funny thing: I started using Crest Night Effects 3 nights ago, and its so hard for me to keep my mouth open to let it dry so I tried to put cotton balls to keep it open and it just proved disasterous so I started using my hair dryer to dry my teeth. Haha, only I would do such a thing. I dunno how long its going to take to notice a difference. I have fairly white teeth anyway, but I want them to be whiter.

"event","Backing up a little further, those of us who are involved with the Big Brothers Big Sisters of MS program, mentoring children at Sunnybrook Children's home had a meeting during lunch yesterday with Ms. Lewis & Ms. Coalter about the issues of the foster care program in MS as well as the fact that so many of us have lost our kids: Allison, Susie, Edmund, Carrie, Chris all are on their 2nd child, & thats 5 out of 9 of us that are involved with the program.

When Sunnybrook takes the kids somewhere else be it a psych hospital, another children's home, whatever they won't tell us where anything about what happened to them. I mean once you've spent 5 or 6 Wednesdays with your child, you get attached and then one day you come and they're gone.. its horrible. I'm one of the lucky ones so far, I still have my original ""little"" as does Leigh, Melanie, and Ashley. I can't imagine what I would do if she was to be taken away. 
     
That's another thing that infuriates me about this state... MS has one of the worst foster care programs. So, so many of these kids get lost in the system. There are too many children & not enough case workers, most of the case workers are dealing with up to 40 different cases which is ridiculous.

It makes me so angry when I know of something that I can't make better. We want the kids to know that we'll be there for them, but Sunnybrook won't allow us to bring them anything including food or candy, we can't take pictures with them, we aren't suppose to hug them, (though we do that anyway) and our time with them is only 45 minutes a week which is definitely not enough time to really help them study for a test or whatever. 

Many of us have tried to request another day to come and tutor, but their schedule at Sunnybrook is so tight that they won't allow it. The environment at the cottages that they live in is not a desirable learning environment and their cottage parents usually aren't educated enough to help them with their homework, and if they are, they can't give individual help because there are 10 girls living in a cabin.

I don't know what I'm going to do at the end of the school year when the program is over. Not knowing what's going to happen to my ""little"" bothers me, and I want to be able to maintain contact with her, to let her know that I care about her."

Anyway, I babysat for Lauren & Drew Friedrich last night & was late b/c I wrote down the wrong time, so it was the first time I've ever been late for a job. Pretty easy though, just popped in the Jungle Book for Drew(he's 4)and he fell asleep relatively quick, so I didn't have to deal with him. Lauren on the other hand practically worships the ground I walk on, so she just aims to please.

So funny, yesterday in English we were watching Othello since we're reading the play right now, & the movie is rated R. Well, this one part comes up with this couple seriously humping each other and Mrs. Graham couldn't get to the TV fast enough to stop it. All the guys were like, ""its not like we've never seen sex before, just let us watch it"".. so I dunno what she's going to do later.

Another thing about Othello. Before reading the play, I had no idea that Othello was black. I didn't know that Shakespeare had any black characters in his plays. So, I find it very interesting, especially since he gets married to Desdemona who is a Venetian. I'm glad that at least Shakespeare wasn't racist.

I'm going to the John Mayer concert in February! I'm super excited even though I'm not a huge fan of his music, but I'll buy the CD or something to learn the songs beforehand. I mean he's really hot, so its cool. hehe see the John Mayer icon--I told you he was pretty hot

5) I went over to the Barnette's house to retrieve my scarf that Susan has had for weeks and then ended up babysitting while she went to the visitation one of her clients who committed suicide

6)Caroline(6yrs) was being a demon child, so Madeleine(10yrs)  and I left her at home with Ralph & went to Primos

7) My little brother, John Michael got to have Rebel, our Beagle sleep with him last night, and my mom kept Dixie, our Boston Terrier with her, which was totally not fair since I didn't get any & of course Rebel woke me up at 1am whining at my door, so I let him in and he slept for like 2 hours and wanted out again, so I just took him downstairs to his room (laundry room)"

"event","I swear I basically spend more time at the doctor's office than I do anywhere else, well... maybe not. But, still I just got to school after having an 8:30 appt at the ENT to look at my CT scan results that I ended up having to get yesterday. I've had a CT before, but I didn't remember having to lay on my stomach with all my weight pressing on my chin.. at least it wasn't a MRI. I get so claustrophobic and the fact that they strap your head down and that it takes 45 mins doesn't help things. The CT scan results didn't show much. The doctor said that if the prescription he gave me doesn't work that I have to get allergy tested again. I've already had to take shots before, when I was young & in 5th-6th grade. Oh, well I guess I make up for the rest of my family since none of them have chronic med problems...

out to lunch 
bye"

"event","I'm in Psychology right now and its not over for another 17 minutes. I'm really glad that I have study hall after lunch so that I can leave. My Psych teacher is a very odd bird. She's easy though, so I'm not complaining. 

I have to go to the ENT today at 2:30, I swear I always miss part of Peer Leadership. But,at least I get to leave school early. I probably will have to do my family sculpting today. I don't know if I'm ready for it yet.

Well, I'm out"

"event","I can't believe its Sunday already. Its great that we have Monday off for MLK day. I've had a pretty low-key weekend so far. Friday after school I went to order Girl Scout cookies from Debbie's twins---- I haven't had Girl Scout cookies in two years since no one comes by our house to sell them. We've bought 8 boxes total, 5 from my cousins, one from Maggie, and one each from Carly and Alex. I'm going to give my grandma some of them. 

Friday night Brooke and I went to see ""Big Fish"" out at Parkway. It wasn't what I had expected, but the movie was still really good. It definitely wasn't a typical Tim Burton film, but I still enjoyed it, and plus having Ewan in it helped. I went home afterward & passed out, the school week had finally caught up with me.

Well, I'm out for now..
going to eat some lunch"

"event","The rain is pouring down and my time in Katimavik is winding down. Nine days. Nine months to nine days.

It's crazy.

Everyone in my group is so ready to head home and get back to their family and friends. Being away from everyone who is important to us has definitely been the hardest part. Screw the language barrier, the shitty paperwork and the boring jobs - that was easy.

But whatever. It's almost all over now and I'm trying to remain positive. Katimavik has thrown me around more than almost anything in my life but in the end I'm definitely coming out on top. I've had the chance to see and do so much. It's been worth it. I'd never do it a second time though. Haha.



Anyways! I get home on the 29th at 10pm and I've got a whole three days to see people before heading off on my university adventure in NB. If anything is going on between the 30th and the 1st, let me know and I'll see if I can fit it in. I really want to see as many people as possible.

But, I gotta run for now.

Peace.

"event","As I write this I am sitting in the old train station museum where I work and I'm wondering where the hell my boss is. She has this strange habit of dissapearing for extended lengths of time and it can get a bit annoying. I've been alone since 10:00am... it's now 4:02pm. I'd go crazy if I wasn't good at finding pointless tasks to complete.

Anyways. I guess I haven't really posted an update in quite some time so I suppose I'm do. 

Katimavik is one month (plus six days) away from finishing and I must admit that I am a little excited because of that. BC is flying by (oh yes... I'm in BC now) and my group is keeping busy with all sorts of crazy activities. Next week we get to dig around in a swamp and pull out invasive plants. Fun? I think so. At the very least it will make for some great photo-ops.

Mike is gone but he is definitely not forgotten. He rubbed the group the wrong way almost constantly and yet I think we all feel a little void without him. Maybe it's just the fact that he always gave us something to complain about or the fact that he was always there. Literally. Always breathing down your neck, always popping into your conversations and always bothering you while you were trying to read/write/go to the bathroom. I can't say I miss it but after eight months it feels strange to be living in a peaceful house. Which isn't to say that we don't still have problems; I could never say that. Someone is always doing something to bug others when you live in a group of ten youth.

Speaking of youth... my birthday is on Sunday. Haha. The big 19. I'd much rather be celebrating this festive occasion in the land of the Bluenosers but what can you do? I'm trapped in a mountain fortress (a beautiful mountain fortress, don't get me wrong) with no way out until August 29th. One month too late. Shame.

I should run though... I've got to close up the museum soon. I hope everyone is doing well and that nobody has forgotten me. I can't wait to see you all again.

Peace

"event","and four to go! I guess I could say that I'm on the way home now (even though I've got a short, three month stop in BC). 

I'm really starting to miss things from home but I'm just trying to remember that I still have years to enjoy those things and only now to enjoy Katimavik. Sure, it drives me absolutely crazy at times but when I'm finished and can look back on the whole experience I know that it will have been worth it. I'll have seen Canada from three perspectives completely different from my own as a born and raised Bluenoser. I'll have connections to people all across the country, from east to west. I'll have tried three jobs that I never thought I would have been interested in. And I'll actually have an idea of what I want from my life.

The last would probably be the most important to me. I'm really starting to discover just how I want to live the next few years and I'm coming up with a plan - something I never had through high school. It isn't set in stone but it is something for me to strive for and something I'll be able to appreciate when everything is said and done.

I'm becoming excited about school again which is what has been lacking for me over the past few years. I want to read, write, listen and study. I want to learn.

I'm ready to make a difference. Maybe just for my province, maybe just for Canada, or maybe for the world. It won't be easy but I think we can all make a difference if we try hard enough. And no one can say that right now the world doesn't need a change.

Peace

I'm sick of summer. Well, not summer... but the work that comes along with summer. I get six shifts a week or more (supposed to have seven next week, but I gave one away) and Pete Luckett owns my damn soul. I want a new job... but I keep thinking that I only have three months left so there is no point.

I wish my life was interesting but all I do is work and play soccer. I haven't even seen anyone who reads this in a long time. I need to get out of this hickish area and see someone... anyone. Maybe tomorrow I'll get off my butt.

Oh, I just remembered why I don't update this thing... it's cause I suck at it. Peace out."

Thank god.

It has taken way to long for this to just end and I'm happy that the wild ride known as high school is over. It had its highs and it definitely had its lows but at least, in the end, I came out on top.

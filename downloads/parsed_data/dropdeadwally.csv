"event","So I'm updating from a public library in Pasadena, California.  Why you ask? Well, apparently my house has over 1,500 channels to watch on TV but has yet to catch up with wifi technology.  It's no biggie, it's a nice walk to the library in 80ish degree weather which I can't complain too much about.  California this time around has been wayyy better this time than all the other times I have come to visit.  I don't know if it's because I needed a break from harsh winter weather, or if I just wanted to get away from all the dramatics and feelings left behind in Boston, who knows...

What I DO know is that so far I have met 3 famous people since I've been here, something I'm not used to being from Everett where the most famous person you meet is the janitor of the high school who ended up being on the news for diddling little kids.  I bought 3 new BAWLIN pairs of shoes since I've been here, which I've been long overdue.  I can only sport my beat up Etnies for so long.  

And finally, this will be for sure my last post on lj.  Along with other aspects in my life I realized needed a change, I need to stop posting on this place.  And I've had this thing since high school which kinda makes me want to throw up.  So as I mentioned in an earlier post, I will be moving this bad boy over to blog spot: www.wafinwalid.blogspot.com  to be exact.


P.S. I'm living with Browne in September, SCORE!

This week has been a roller coaster, to say the least...a combination of too much drama, work and studying.  I don't think I've been this tired since finals time last semester, what a coincidence since I've taken 2 midterms already this week, and have my last one tomorrow in public policy and administration.  I just want tomorrow to be over already.  I'm so excited for Thursday, I'm going to one of those dance parties over on Landsdowne that CAMPUS group hosts every week..I have a feeling it's going to be exactly like Montreal was, lots of dancing and an overall intoxicated time.  Oh and did I mention I'm leaving for LA this Friday for my spring break? As much fun as spending my spring break in 75 degree weather (YES!), I know absolutely there.  So I forsee my spring break consisting of play rock band and reading all day.

"event","Ok, so I just finished watching that movie 'College' that came out last year and all I can say is LOL.  I'm not going to say that it was a great movie, because it obviously doesn't accomplish that.  It's basically a reproduction of American Pie/Superbad or a modern-day Animal House if you will.  

What pissed me off the most was that I was like these guys, I ACTUALLY thought that college was like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNzjZlMZ7rs .  Don't get me wrong, the not sleeping for 3 days straight, emptying of the bank account, the laughing, the crying, the crying as a result of laughing all true--unicorn tattoo and smoking a tampon not so much.  But I would just watch it and laugh because that is what I actually thought college was like! To the point where I broke up with the girl I dated senior year in HS because I thought college would dominate any type of relationship.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not regretting the break up at all, hahaha I'm just saying Hollywood greatly exaggerates the college experience.  The only place I can see shit like that happening is places like Nebraska and those midwestern states where they have nothing better to do, cops don't care, and they're surrounded by nothing but trees.  But I digress.  

They began showing my apartment to possible new tenants which is kinda sad.  I love this apartment, it's enormous, got my own room, own bathroom...so I'll guess it's time to find a new place.  I want to get like a 8-10 bedroom place in Boston with a bunch of people...don't tell me impossible because my roommate's boyfriend just signed a lease with 9 of his friends for a--10 bedroom, 4 floors, kitchen and bathroom on every floor and 2 fireplaces.  I WANT THAT.  It all comes out to about $700ish a month which isn't bad at all for living in Boston AND a place of that caliber.  

Fuck, I need to go back to Everett and get a bunch of shit, but each day I push it to the next...can you blame me? It's winter and I don't want to take two trains and a bus to get back to the durrty.  Maybe I'll drop by sometime this weekend, I miss everyone from Everett...it sucks I have a different spring break than everyone else.  I guess it doesn't matter since I'll be in California anyway...yes I'm complaining about having to go to California for spring break.  Don't get me wrong, I miss my family, but aside from them I know absolutely no one there and I'll be there for an entire week.  Not to mention two planes have crashed in under a month.  Huh, and they say the odds of a plane going down is 1 in 160,000,000, so you can see how excited I am to fly 6.5 hours.

Whats been happening in the meantime? School has been raping me.  This semester is exponentially harder than last semester...and I just found out the other day that I made Dean's list, wahoo! I hope I get to stay in Boston for my co-op, I don't really feel like having to move to Washington D.C., New York or California...but there might be some really good opportunities there so who knows.  If I end up staying in Boston I'll probably get a place with Steve, Jasmin and possibly Kevin.  I can't wait to go on co op, not worry about homework and make some $$$$'z.  Speaking of moneyz, I got to go back to Everett and get my W2 so I can get some money back!

Constant disagreements and fighting has resulted in me no longer being with Armie.  Ironically, it happened the day after out 8-month anni.  Not much to say about it besides we realized that stuff was not working out like we wanted to because of school and me having to work.  Maybe there will be something possible for us in the future, but as of now I have a lot more time on my hands I haven't had for the past 8 months.  I just hope I can keep myself busy enough so that I'm not by myself and overthink things too much...

Hell, I don't care if I don't get anything.  Just having a place to go for the holiday is good enough for me since I won't be with family.  

Went back to Everett yesterday for the first time since the end of summer, not much has changed.  No one has really changed.  Though I'm stil; trying to figure out if that's a good or a bad thing.  Joe's birthday party was pretty fun, I got to see some people I haven't seen in a while which is always a good refresher.  

I'm going back to work at the psychiatric hospital in Belmont tomorrow.  The commute is so brutal but I still drag myself through it--though it may take me two trains, a bus and a shuttle to get there, the money and simplicity of the work makes up for it."

It's only 5 extra courses, and the classes don't even sound that difficult: accounting, finance, human resource management,  etc etc.  Hopefully this will help me understand what I want to do with my life better, and I'm sure it doesn't hurt to see a major and a minor on a piece of diploma paper.  But that won't be happening for at least another year and a half--two years?

I will be going back to work at McClean Hospital during winter break so I can make some really good, steady cash that is much needed by the time Christmas rolls around.  Sure it's pretty much winter, and the hospital is all the way in Belmont, but the hourly pay is well worth the 50-minute commute.

I'm currently working on trying to go to Paris for New Years, which should be bawlin.  I know, I know, most likely won't be going to Montreal, and after coming back from Montreal a couple weeks ago I know how much fun it is.  But wtf, this is Paris we're talking about, plus I probably won't have to pay for the trip, or that much spending money so I can't complain too much about that.  

Right now I am in my Ethnic Relations class, the last class that is separating me from my Thanksgiving break.  Though I will not be spending Thanksgiving in Everett, I should be back in the durrty E for the weekend so whoever else is going to be back, HIT ME UP."

It was just so convenient living in Boston, everything was just so close and there was always something to do.  Yesterday was the first time I went out since being back...I went to townline with Kaitlyn and Red but it was a really good time.  I feel like if I don't smoke there's nothing I can do here.  It's not that I don't want to, I just can't because I'm going to be interviewing for internships.  Ahhh the irony.  

Friday at Garrity's looks promising...I heard talks of a keg which is very intriguing.  I may even go to the Chiodos concert with Red and Mosch tomorrow if I don't have to work.  Adg has been trying to entice Brenda to letting us have a party sometime in May...chances are looking good, so everyone should be looking forward to another epic party at the house.

I don't know what everyone's infatuations have been with relationships lately.  They're so overrated.  You don't need a relationship, you're 19/20.  If you're in college, that should be emphasized even more.  Just go out and have fun, party, meet a bunch of girls...just live life doods.  Forget love, forget commitment, forget all that shit.  That stuff is virtually non-existent at this age as you can see the number of long-term relationships that have crumbled over the past couple months.  The only way you're going to be bound with a girl is if you get her pregnant (sorry Andrew).  So concluding, go with the flow and stop thinking so damn much about love.  I know it's hard with the lack of girls this illustrious city of Everett presents...but  I am determined, as should you be to find a speckle of chance in this massive crap-pool known as Everett.

I'm not even that excited for summer to come which is incredibly surprising.  It's mainly because I have so much fun at school and don't mind the price of having to do homework and papers that tag along with the crazy fun experiences.  And hopefully I don't get kicked out of the room as much as  I did last time I came to Everett.  Hopefully Matt and Andrew turn down the notch on the whole having their girlfriends over constantly at my expense to the point where I can't even sleep in my own room.  If it stays the same as last time, I foresee a very depressing summer in my future.    Aside from that though, I'm pretty excited that everyone will be back in Everett and it'll be somewhat similar to the high school days where we're all actually in the same city.  

That's all I can think of to write.
P.S. anyone that has not come and see me at Northeastern, feel free to call me and hang out.  I've gotten a slew of recent bitchings about me inviting other people up like Tim and Searcy and not inviting other people.  They called me to hang out, so do the same..it'll be good times.

I'm too scared to even think of what I'm going to do after.  Get a job in the 'real world'?, go to law school? Graduate school? I have no clue, but whatever I end up doing I'm going to kick its ass because I'm awesome.  Sure, that sounds a bit too conceited, but hey that's how I feel.  

As for school itself, Northeastern is still....Northeastern.  Last week Searcy and Tim came up on Wednesday.  Talked, played some beirut and smoked some hookah.  Searcy jammed a bit with my roommates on the guitar which was chill too, just a really good night considering it was a Wednesday.  

Friday night Steve and some other people from BU came and we had a little party over at Browne's which was real fun.  Afterwards some of us went back to my place to hang out and smoke some hookah.  But it was Friday night/Saturday morning I committed the ultimate sin.  I don't really want to dive into what happened...but it could quite possibly be something that can bit me in the ass.

Thursday-Went to go see Therefore I Am at The Living Room in Providence, RI.  Such a fucking awesome show, even though Kori and I got lost looking for the damn venue.  Where else besides Rhode Island do you have to drive through the back of a Dunkin Donuts parking lot to get to where the show is being held? Nowhere.  Made it back only to have to write a 5 page paper due the next day, whatever.

Friday- Four Year Strong and Bayside played at Northeastern.  Four Year strong was insane and Bayside was ehhhhhh.  Went to Douglass Park for a party at Devin's and some chicks ended up walking around with their tops off saying they were nudists, rofl.  

Saturday- Went to the aquarium with some people, and it was fucking bomb.  Sharks, octopusi (that's probably not the plural version of octopus), huge tortoises andddd PENGUINS.  Almost made Adam choke to death from laughing so hard when I made a joke.  Got back to my place and did some Irish car bombs with my roommate and his friends til they went to a bar.  Damn me not being 21. >_<  Went to a couple different parties up in Mission Hill with Dave and Chaz which was a really good time.

And then there's today.  I got called into work so I couldn't go to the St. Patty's Day parade, unfortunately.  Hoping to lay low tonight and do a bunch of homework I have so I can actually not feel guilty going to the huge party tomorrow night back at The House....while will probably take the cake for being the most fucking insane of anything I did over the weekend.  

Fuck, I just remembered I have to arm wrestle Ben Fils.  And didn't even start training yet.  Oh well, looks like I have about 31 hours to train and hopefully gain about 15lbs of muscle on my right bicep to stand a chance.  I believe in me, and you should too!

Getting sexiled on several occasions and getting bailed on when I had plans with people made me think it was a mistake not going to LA, but then he said hi to me; no I'm not talking in a homosexual way I'm talking about DEVAL PATRICK.  
Yes, you read it right, as I was working in downtown I stepped outside and guess who is casually walking down the streets of Downtown Crossing? Yep, our governor Deval Patrick...of course he wasn't by himself, he had two secret service guys with him and a black SUV following close behind him.  But I swear, out of everyone walking around, I was the ONLY person who realized this was Deval Patrick.  He saw me staring at him in awe and waved to me and said, ""Hi, how are you?"" And you know what I said? ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOTHING.  I could nto utter a word for the life of me, I just let out a faint sound that sounded something like ""uhhhehhi"" I don't even think he even heard me.  Oh well, if I ever see him again hopefully my brain won't go comatose again and I'll actually be able to say something.  

Also, after last night, Olin College is officially my most favorite place ever.  The Mexico party was ridiculous.  There was a good 350 people at the party and the school absolutely did not care that these kids were throwing this epic party.  Browne, Dewey, Joe, Tim and I had such a good fucking time.  Though I did not wingman for Tim like I promised, he did justtttt fine on his own.  And best of all BROWNE WAS BUMPING AND GRINDING WITH A CRIPPLED CHICK.  You know you can die happy when you see a drunk Browne grinding up on a girls ass while she is being supported by a crutch, amazing.  Dewey did his usual thing going on drunken tirades and calling girls whores, trollops and scrumpets, awesome.  And to my surprise, JOE'S PANTS STAYED ON THE ENTIRE NIGHT.  I know you all are just as surprised as I am.  All of you guys who were going to go, but didn't totally missed out on a sweet ass party.

If I could go back in time I would probably switch my major to engineering and just go there for school.  After partying until about 5 a.m. we waited around for an hour before we drove back at 6 since Browne and I had to work.  I got back to Northeastern, ate a bagel, slept for an hour and a half and am now at work.

Besides the fact that I'll have my own room, is that it is sooo much cheaper than living on campus which is awesome.

Since the Patriots lost the Super Bowl, the bet that my roommate Harrison, made with my other roommate Hugo was that if the Pats lost that he would have to wax his chest, so that's what last night was spent doing.

One of my roommates cheated on his girlfriend which was HILARIOUS.  Me and Hugo (my other roommate), have been telling him do it for the longest time.  He is so unhappy with his relationship...it reminds me a lot of the relationships some people I know are in now/past relationships there have been.

I can't handle that.

My flight from Cali to Boston got canceled, so I ended up getting stranded in Utah, a.k.a. Mormon country for 5 hours which was pretty lame.  The whole highlight of it was eating at the California Pizza Kitchen there.  

Now I'm back in school....weeks before anyone else goes back but hey I get out for summer before you guys!
Adg was clutch over break....picking me up from the airport and helping me move back into school.  I'm kinda glad I'm back though, I was starting to feel like the 5th wheel at the house all the time...but hey what can you do.  

Here's to a new semester."

"event","Come Decemeber 13, I will officially be done with this semester! I'm so excited to be free, no more homework, no more writing papers, no more interviewing people for class assignments...just the pleasure of being able to relax.  It may be only for 3 weeks, but hey I guess it's better than nothing.  

I never realized how different a private University was from a State school, back at UMB we got a whole week free to ""study"" for finals.  Sure I used that week to lose more brain cells rather than filling them with knowledge, Northeastern only gives you a day and then right into finals.  Luckily I only have two finals and then one take-home paper for a final.  I don't know what my schedule is going to be like during vacation.  I'm not sure when I'm going to California, or if I'm spending Christmas there or at the house in Everett.  We'll see.  

I was reading a little of this book called IV the other day by Chuck Klosterman, it was HILARIOUS.  He's the same guy that wrote, 'Sex, Drugs and Coco Puffs.'  Definitely want to read his stuff over vacation.  It's going to be weird leaving Willis Hall for a couple weeks.  I'm used to playing the drums almost everyday, the sometimes grotesque hair-clogged shower (not from me) and the room either smelling like a foot or a fresh bottle of Febreeze.  And Lucas is going on co-op next semester so I'll be getting a new roommate, booooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.  Hopefully he isn't a dick, or I will have to initiate Operation Make Roommate Move Out.

Valentina leaves in about 30 days, I want to feel sad, or upset that she's leaving to go to school 3,000 miles away.  Maybe it's because we don't nearly see each other as much as when I used to go to UMB.  I don't even see the point of this open relationship, or being in a relationship and knowing the exact day when it will end stupid move on my part.
Oh well, hopefully I will be in sunny Los Angeles soaking in the sun and all the fakeness California has to offer."

I was just as surprised, I'm usually online at work watching Law and Order or Scrubs on the computer and get pissed off whenever a customer comes in, but hey everyone that gave me a review thought I was awesome.  

Tuesday I was supposed to go to the Chiodos concert, but Red and Adg ended up bailing, so me and Matt were going to go so of course tickets were sold out.  How the hell did Chiodos sell out the Roxy? That's beyond me.  

This was the last full week of classes and boyyyy do I got some shit ahead of me.  I need to write two final papers by the end of the weekend and I got an Environmental Science test on Tuesday, awesome.  I pretty much need to get a B on that test so I don't get a D.  I never realized how short Northeastern's Christmas break, only 3 weeks! When I was at UMB I had like a month and a half off, it was awesome.  

Yesterday I was walking on Huntington with my roommates and the self-proclaimed, ""best dressed homeless man"" came up to us.  Now, this wasn't your ordinary homeless man, this guy didn't beg for money.  Instead, he says he raps for small change and a couple bucks so he rapped us a song he made called ""Coward, Conspiring Motherfuckers.""  Apparently it was his rap tribute to the police, it was pretty good though....I gave him a buck.  

If I can get through Wednesday, I should be fine.  I'm still debating if it will be better for me to go back to Everett to study for my finals or just stay on campus, we'll see."

I'm drinking this huge obnoxious sized cannister of Jolt, which is a little saddening.  Mainly because I used to drink it back during lunch in High School, remember standing outside and eating lunch?! Those were the good days.  
Remember slapping Pappathan's snickers out of his hand, and then all of us stomping on it while it was on the ground?! Those were the good days! Pappathan is going to probably read that, still get pissed and tell us all we owe him a Snickers bar, oh well.  See, Everett High did provide SOME good memories.

But now, we're just all scattered around, damn you college.  But that's mainly why I'm looking forward to Halloween the most, it'll be like a reunion.  Or, maybe I'm just being a little too nostalgic.  

I love the costume I have, not only because it did not cost me much at all (around $20), but also because I can be so many different things.  Ranging from one of the guys from Reservoir Dogs, one of the Blues Brothers, a secret service agent, Will Smith from men in black and my personal favorite, Barack Obama.  And it's great because the Halloween party I went to at BU last night, I would just tell everyone I was something different.  

The best highlights of the night included the party turning from just regular music most of the night, to straight up Indian Punjabi music, and all the Indian people there singing along to it and dancing, I was pretty gone, thus making it 10 times more fun than it actually was.  And nothing beats the 15 minute conversation I had with our Kenyan cab driver about how and why I was so awesome, then I think I accidentally tipped him like $13...hate when that happens.

2. Books- I decided I'm actually going to start reading more actively now, I don't think I've read an entire book that I wanted to read since like, Freshman year when I read Monster.  Gotta hop into that, and with some help from Mr. Searcy telling me some good choices, the transition into steering away from being an idiotic lazy college kid who doesn't read will begin.

3. Play more Full Tilt- I've built my bankroll from $25 up to $215, I've been up and down lately, but if I start playing more I hope I can crack $1,000 by the end of the summer.


That's all I can think of for now.

Scotty leaves in 2 days which is greatly saddening, it's alright I suppose, it's his dream to go into the Army and he's acting on it which is great for him.

college sucks, i've had to write a paper every single night since the long weekend = / but i think i kicked the sociology test's ass today so that's a plus

i love not being able to work because i forget to bring my pants, but it gave me a well needed day off

&&&&
last but not least, i'm going to the ehs prom, rofl.  I know it goes against everything I said about college kids going to prom and how it was lame.  but it was a really good friend who needed a date so why the hell not.  gives me an excuse to dress up nice, ride in a limo, dance and get drunk woo hoo!"

Back in the sixties, schools brought in members of minorities to talk us out of our prejudices.&nbsp;  One was a motorcyclist who went through the lyrics of a then-popular song about a fool who was the terror of highway one-oh-one, explaining how ""black-denim trousers and motorcycle boots, and a black leather jacket"" were practical safety equipment -- but not (everyone chuckle) the eagle on the back. 

I don't have very many posts in my buffer, so I think I'll do the same for cycling clothes. 

(And now the buffer is empty, so I'll post it.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Shoes and socks are your connection to the power train; they are as much component as clothing. 

Bike shoes need a firm sole to protect your foot from the pedals, and it helps a lot if the shoe can be attached firmly to the cranks 

All my shoes are bike shoes now that I've learned that it's closed-toe shoes that are causing my corns.&nbsp;  How the toe can make a difference when the corns are on the sides of the foot I don't know, but there it is.&nbsp;  Perhaps it's that sandals are usually adjustable in width; my lace-to-the-toe Duegis seem to cause less trouble.&nbsp;  Or maybe it's just that I never walk in the Duegis. 

So I no longer save new black oxfords to walk to church in, and regard my oxfords exclusively as ""city bike shoes"", to wear when I frequently get off and walk, and have to unclip for a light or stop sign every block or so. 

I have shoes with wooden insoles and slot cleats that I wear whenever I'm reasonably sure that I won't have to walk and wear off the irreplaceable cleats.&nbsp;  I can ride farther in these, and climb steeper hills. 

Summer or winter, you can't beat pure wool for socks.&nbsp;  They allow air to get at your feet, and don't feel nasty when sweaty.&nbsp;  (But feeling dry when they are wet makes it hard to tell whether or not they are ready to put back into the drawer after you wash them.)&nbsp;  Wool socks, even partly-wool socks, are hard to find, and when found are more likely than not to have advertisements knitted in. 


Next is the traditional black shorts.&nbsp;  These don't come in women's sizes, and washable wool by the yard is extinct so I can't make my own, so I wear linen knickers.&nbsp;  I sometimes wear jeans, but I have to pin them at the ankles, I have to take anything large out of the pockets, and they rub on my knees if I don't tie strings around them just below the knees -- it's easier to change pants. 

Pity I can't wear black shorts.&nbsp;  They don't catch on things as my knickers sometimes do, and tight-fitting pants protect from abrasion better than loose pants.&nbsp;  In the days when bike shorts were made of wool and lined with real leather, you could glue them on with cold cream or a special ""chamois fat"" to guarantee that there would be no friction between the chamois and your skin.&nbsp;  This greatly improves comfort during a hundred-mile ride, but you really, really want something to change into at the finish line. 


The special shirt: 

I missed a question on an Effective Cycling test once.&nbsp;  I was supposed to say that ""to prevent wind-flapping"" was a reason to wear a jersey. Since, at that time, I'd see someone wearing no shirt at all every time I went out, I'd have checked ""prevent sunburn"", but that wasn't on the list. 

You can prevent wind flapping with any tight-fitting shirt, including T-shirts and turtlenecks.&nbsp;  (Not to mention that my current jerseys do flap:&nbsp;   http://wlweather.net/PAGESEW/BLOG1XV/SLEEVG6h.JPG http://wlweather.net/PAGESEW/LINJERSY.HTM ) The reason for wearing a jersey instead of a T-shirt is the pockets: pockets for stuff you want to get at while riding, and pockets for stuff you want to be sure goes with you when you walk away from the bike. 

I have five pockets in my jerseys instead of the traditional three. Three are the traditional back pockets:  one for my handkerchief and reading glasses, one for my wallet, one for keys, sunscreen, lipstick, and so forth.&nbsp;  (I used to carry Halt in this pocket too, but then we moved to Indiana and Hoosiers -- in this county, at least -- don't encourage their dogs to play in the street.)  Two pockets in front were originally modeled after the pockets on men's shirts, then moved up to avoid the part of my chest that is sharply curved.&nbsp;  The right one, originally for starlight mints, now holds my cell phone; the left one holds notebook, pencil, spare handkerchiefs, and shopping list. 

All my jerseys have high necks to reduce the area that has to be covered with sunscreen.&nbsp;  I don't do anything special to the necks of winter jerseys, because I always wrap the tails of my scarves around my neck to prevent wind-flapping. 


Headgear:

I used to wear a gilligan hat http://www.wlweather.net/PAGEJOY/CENT2015/HATS.HTM and found it the perfect headgear for outdoor activity: the brim can be turned down on the side where the sun is, and turned up on the side where it isn't. 

But on a bike, there is risk of a hat blowing off.&nbsp;  When I first started riding, I held my hat in place with an antique hatpin.&nbsp;  Then one day I fell off the road and rolled down an embankment, and got up thinking ""I did all that with nine inches of sharp steel on my head!!!""  I went straight home and sewed bonnet strings onto my hat. 

That worked very well until we planned a ride from New York to Indiana, and the group decided that if we were going to be on the bikes all day every day, we ought to wear those new-fangled hard-shell helmets. 

What a helmet mostly protects you against is getting yelled at by ignorami -- the latest helmets frankly eschew protection for the back of the head in favor of exposing the suspension for easier adjustment -- but once I started wearing a rear-view mirror on my helmet, the increased range of vision more than compensated for the loss of vision caused by a helmet's limited and un-adjustable protection from sun glare.&nbsp;  One can, after all, tip one's head and roll one's eyes. 

I have one of the special cycling caps -- if I haven't mislaid it --but never wore it on the bike and can't say how it works.&nbsp;  Bicycle caps are like baseball caps, but have no button on top, come in sizes instead of having adjustable straps at the back, and the bill is very short so that it doesn't block your view of the road when you are down on the drops.&nbsp;  The abbreviated bill also fails to catch the wind, so it shouldn't blow off. 


Gloves:

Cycling gloves are a leather pad held to the palm side of your hand by the barest minimum of glove, originally coarse cotton lace.&nbsp;  I saw a pair of the traditional crocheted gloves for sale recently, but it was far too large for me.&nbsp;  A cycling glove must fit very tightly, so that your hand can't abrade itself against the inside of the glove. 

Weight-lifting gloves are a bit longer in the finger, but work just fine -- after all, the original purpose of both gloves is to protect your hand while you are gripping a bar. 

Like a helmet, the secondary purpose of a glove is the more-important purpose.&nbsp;  If you fall, you put out a hand to catch yourself.&nbsp;  The doctor who X-rayed my broken clavicle told me that this is a hard-wired reflex and you can't do anything about it -- and it's just as well; a broken clavicle or a broken arm can be repaired; brain damage can't. 

So when your palm hits the rough pavement, you want a bit of tough leather protecting your tendons.&nbsp;  Even the mildest road rash is very inconvenient if it's on your hand, and a small bit of glass could cripple you for life. 

Back in the days when I wore three pairs of hand-knitted gloves, I dispensed with the cycling gloves -- I knit tight and the yarn was tough; three layers were at least as good as leather. 

Ha!  There's a topic for a new post:  how to knit winter cycling gloves. 

Now that I wear store-bought gloves, I wear modern all-plastic, no-ventilation, too-hot-to-wear-in-the-summer cycling gloves under them.&nbsp;  And I stay home when I need three pairs.&nbsp;  It doesn't happen that often now that we live a bit farther south. 

I didn't score any new ""fifty-cent""[1] gloves this fall, and the last two pairs that I bought, I had to pay extra for decidedly-undesired conductive fingertips.&nbsp;  This may be the end of an era. 

Warm gloves for cycling should be yellow, or at least white, so that people can see your hand signals.&nbsp;  To keep all the dirt on one side, mark them right and left.&nbsp;  I make a small bar tack in red thread on each cuff to mark the back of the glove. 

It's possible to operate the controls of a bike while wearing split mittens.&nbsp;  I think these are called ""lobster-claw gloves"" when sold in stores.&nbsp;  Mittens are essential in freezing weather because your hands lead into the wind no matter how you ride, and you can't work your brakes if your hands are numb. 

[1]  When these gloves first appeared, they were two pairs for a dollar. They cost significantly more the following year, but I still think of them as fifty-cent gloves.

There is a virtual stop sign at the mouth of every driveway, alley, parking lot, and anywhere else that something that isn't quite a road intersects a road or a street.

If two equal byways intersect and nobody has bothered to put up a sign saying who has the right-of-way, it's a four-way stop.

Today I was riding close to the curb on Park Avenue when I saw a sunken manhole centered on the line I was following.  

A glance in the mirror showed that the car behind me would overtake precisely when I reached the manhole, and that the driver had already committed to a path that would have given ample clearance if I had been a stationary object, but didn't leave me any room to dodge.

I managed to slow enough that when I reached the manhole, most of the car was ahead of me and I could thread a safe path between the hole and the car.&nbsp;    I did not spare a glance to determine whether the ""manhole"" was actually a drain.

I spent a lot of the rest of the trip muttering 
""Always leave yourself room to dodge to the right.  
Always leave yourself room to dodge to the right.  
Always leave yourself room to dodge to the right.  
Always leave yourself room to dodge to the right.""

Negative exercise should be more widely known.&nbsp;  It's a form of weight lifting in which you put the weight down instead of picking it up. 

You can control the descent of much more weight than you can lift.

My left arm atrophied while I was in a body cast, and when the exercises my doctor prescribed had done all they could, I resigned myself to never again being able to lift my hand high enough to signal a right turn.&nbsp;  (This must have been *way* back when, because it didn't take me long to discover that if you give a through-the-car-window right-turn signal while on a bike, drivers wave back.) 

A few years later, my spouse joined a Nautilus club, and I went along. 

When I got to the overhead press machine, I not only couldn't lift the handle, the only way I could get my left hand on the handle was to pick it up with my right hand and put it there. 

But if the attendant lifted the weight, I could put it down.&nbsp;  As weeks and months went by, the weight I put down increased, and after I'd done my set of negatives, he would pull the pin out and I would attempt, vainly, to lift ten pounds. 

In a weight room, one counts one's reps silently, so as not to distract other patrons who are also counting their reps.&nbsp;  But one day I *shouted* ""ONE!"" and instead of glaring at me, the whole room applauded. 

I can still lift that arm just as high as the other.&nbsp;  But I forget to make a point of it for weeks at a time, so it hurts more than the other arm when I do it.&nbsp;  But normal activities such as getting the toaster off the top shelf keep my arm reasonably free.

Way back when, I thought that when I got to this age, I would buy a mixte.&nbsp;  Turns out that mixtes went extinct before I did; the name is still around, but more often than not it's applied to a drop-frame bike, rather than to a bike that replaces the top tube with a pair of mixte stays that run from the head tube to the rear drop-out. 

But it also turns out that I can still ride my diamond frame.&nbsp;  I simply have to remember to put my leg over the top tube knee first when mounting, and go foot first, knee last when dismounting. 

And I've stopped being embarrassed about needing to grab my ankle with my hand to help my foot clear the saddle.

A few years ago, I bought a Trek Pure model of ""comfort bike"" so that I could exercise a sprained knee without putting any weight on it.&nbsp;   It's been useful several times since:&nbsp;  It makes an excellent granny walker, and if a hill gets too steep to draisine, the extra-high handlebars and the deep notch in the middle of the frame make it a good rolling cane.&nbsp;  I rode it around the block one day when I needed a walker to get to where I'd parked it, and at least twice I've bungeed a cane to the back. 

And it's also a dandy toy:&nbsp;  it sits in the garage ready to go, and if I feel like a little spin, I can hop onto it in whatever I happen to be wearing, as long as I'm willing to leave the house in it.&nbsp;  If the pants I'm wearing are already shabby, I don't even pin my ankles to keep my hems from rubbing on the sprocket guard.&nbsp;  

If I'm feeling poorly on a Sunday, I'll ride it wearing floor-length skirts &mdash; but I do have a special pair of pedal pushers to wear instead of pettipants on those occasions; I have to hike the skirts up quite a bit, and don't want to show white ruffled underwear. 

The Trek is so un-fussy about footwear that I took a lap around the block barefoot.&nbsp;  The pedals got to feeling rather rough before I got back, so I've run back for sandals ever since, but I also insist on wearing footgear for walking.&nbsp;  (Tried leaving home barefoot once; found there's nothing to walk on but sharp gravel and hot asphalt.) 

So the Trek would seem to be the ideal just going someplace machine &mdash; if one could go someplace on it. 

During my first rehab, I rode one point six miles to the grocery store twice, going by way of the emergency room seven tenths of a mile farther away the second time.&nbsp;  The first trip was an achievement and the second was an expedition. 

I've lost count of the times I've walked to that grocery, but I think that the number of trips by Trek Pure will stay at two.&nbsp;  If I'm feeling good, I've got a real bike, and if I'm feeling bad, I have a car and a truck.&nbsp;  Or I can phone for pizza. 

Why?&nbsp;  For openers, it's so slow to start moving that going through a stoplight is terrifying; if I ever do ride it out of the village again, I'll get off and take the sidewalk to the pedestrian crossing. 

The Trek doesn't climb worth a nickel; I have to use its bottom gear on slopes that I had never been aware of on my Fuji.&nbsp;  And that bottom gear is fairly low; the problem is that one can't apply any force to the pedals &mdash; which is a major feature when the machine is used for rehab; you can't strain anything without trying to. 

The ""comfortable"" upright posture forbids you to use any of the large muscles in your legs, and the ""flatfoot"" feature means that the seat is so low that I get only half a stroke of power out of each rotation of the pedals. 

And there is only one way to hold the handlebars.&nbsp;  When I get tired of that position, the ride is over. 

With the drop bars on my Fuji, I can sit up when the going is easy, shift to the tops of the hooks and lean forward a little, or get down on the drops and lean forward a lot.&nbsp;  Male riders have an intermediate position on the brake hoods, but since I have small hands, I have ""junior"" brake levers, which have no hoods.

After you put on a stretch-to-fit stocking and get it settled into place, pinch it at the big toe, stretch it, and let it spring back.&nbsp;   The stocking will fit much better.

To stay awake between noon and three o'clock, I need a hefty jolt of caffeine.&nbsp;  By good luck, I never became habituated to caffeine, so a pint of cold tea will do the job. 

The summer before last, I put tiles band-sawed from a brick of tea into a glass saucepan, filled the pan with water, and brought it to a boil. When it was boiling, I'd put in some lemon grass and a sprig of cinnamon basil (or whatever I found in the garden that I thought would ameliorate the taste of boiled tea), put the lid on, and allow it to cool.&nbsp;  Then I'd strain the tea into a pitcher, refill the pan, boil the leaves again, strain this batch into the pitcher, and throw out the leaves. 

I would divide this strong tea into bottles, freeze them, and just before an all-day ride I would fill the head space of a bottle with fruit juice and put the bottle into my cooler, to be put into the front bottle cage at noon.&nbsp;  It would be about half frozen at this stage, and thaw quickly in the summer heat. 

Come fall, it came time to make tea and I realized that the tea wouldn't thaw fast enough now that the heat was bearable.&nbsp;  The dime dropped, and I put two heaping teaspoons of loose tea into a bottle, filled it, put it into the back bottle cage, and left it at garage temperature all night.&nbsp;  (Some folks call cold-brewed tea ""sun tea"", but the sun is strictly optional; it brews just fine in a dark refrigerator, but takes a few hours longer than it does at ambient on a hot day.) 

Last summer I brewed my tea one bottle at a time.&nbsp;  I'd put tea into a stainless saucepan, fill a bottle, empty the bottle into the saucepan, set it over the lowest-possible heat, when it came to a boil maybe an hour later, I'd turn off the heat, put on the lid, allow it to cool, then chill it until time to strain it into a bottle.&nbsp;  I might freeze as much juice as I thought would replace what had boiled away and what had soaked into the leaves, or I might empty the saucepan into the bottle and then fill the bottle with juice.&nbsp;  Or I might freeze a little tea in a disposable bottle, fill it up from the saucepan, and freeze any left-overs for next time. 

I really, really wish that Marsh hadn't stopped selling Smith Brothers Caffeine drops.

Amazingly, there exist people who object to wearing cycling-specific clothing on bicycles &mdash; some of them running in circles and screeching hysterically about it. 

The ones who say ""wearing Spandex makes you look as though you were trying to dress up as Superman"", I'll ignore with the contempt they deserve. 

Besides, *good* cycle clothes don't contain a trace of Spandex or any other brand of elastane except in the waistband and the back-pocket closings &mdash; they get their stretch from being 100% wool. But machine-washable wool has become unobtainable &mdash; hence my years-long project to put hundreds of dollars of labor into renovating a jersey that cost less than sixty dollars in the first place. 
    
Then there are those who shout that we shouldn't wear cycling clothes because it gives beginners the idea that they can't ride their disposable Walmart bikes without spending hundreds of dollars on special clothing.&nbsp;  Say What?  

Sure, it would be irresponsible to tell beginners that they can't ride in their blue jeans, but nobody is doing that &mdash; in fact, when I began, an experienced rider advised me ""don't ever try wearing black shorts, because you won't be able to ride in anything else if you do."" 

Entities who say that I should be uncomfortable in order to set a good example are no different from entities who say that I should wear crippling shoes because it is stylish to look easy to catch. 

Wear what's comfortable and ignore the fashion critics.

I have often said that mirrors are important enough that it's worth wearing a helmet just to provide a firm support for your rear-view mirror. 

I recently discovered that now that Chuck Harris is dead, it is no longer possible to buy a helmet mirror. 

Hubbub's mirrors were designed to be a substitute for mirrors that Mr. Harris could not make fast enough, but they are an inch and five-eighths wide &mdash; a bit more than half again the proper width.&nbsp;  If you do the math, that means that they block more than twice as many steradians as they need to, so they don't fit neatly into the upper left corner that you don't use very much.&nbsp;  They are, in short, no better than the billboard mirrors that my local bike shop gave up trying to sell. 

But, it now occurs to me, one could mount one of the billboard mirrors so high and so far to the left that part of it isn't in your range of vision at all.&nbsp;  Too late; I've already taken my Hubbub mirror to the Goodwill store.&nbsp;  By good luck, my spouse remembered that he had stashed away a Chuck Harris mirror that fastens with soldered-on clips instead of the bent wires on mine, and the clips can be attached to the suspension of my no-helmet helmet, so I can at long last wear my new hat. 

(The foam hats you see today started out as liners for hardshell helmets.)</lj-cut>"

When I first reached my full height, I weighed one hundred and fifteen pounds, and I was plump.&nbsp;  I got plumper with the passing of years. 

A decade or three later, I started taking the September Century seriously, and between exercising more and having less time to nibble, my weight dropped to a hundred and twenty pounds.&nbsp;  One friend compared my appearance to pictures taken at Dachau, and when I got access to a swimming pool for the first time in years, I jumped into the deep end expecting to bob up like a cork, and went to the bottom like a rock.&nbsp;  Muscle is a lot denser than fat. 

I noticed that I was exhausted after every ride, no matter how long or short.&nbsp;  Soon after returning home, I would feel as though I were a marionette and someone had cut my strings. 

One day I had two separate conditions either of which by itself would have been a good reason to spend the day in bed, but for some now-forgotten reason, I <em>had</em> to go to Guilderland. 

About a mile from home, I realized that I'd forgotten to bring cough drops.&nbsp;  It was about as far to the village as to go back, so I went on and stopped at the supermarket.&nbsp;  Alas, there wasn't a single cough drop to be had.&nbsp;  I bought a bag of hard candy; candy would suppress the cough until it had all dissolved, then I could take another. 

I not only wasn't exhausted when I came back, I felt better than I had when I started.&nbsp;  That was a pretty low bar, but it inspired me to carry candy whenever I rode, and I never had any more sinking spells. 

When candy is taken as medicine, it's wise to always take the same flavor &mdash; when I carried mixed flavors, I would think ""that red one was pretty good; I wonder what flavor the purple one is?"" and overdose. 

I settled on starlight mints because starlight mints are always available.&nbsp;  Well, I forgot to take mints to Columbia City once, and had to hit the third pharmacy before I found some, but I did find them, in a town where I didn't even know the territory. 

Starlight mints have another virtue:&nbsp;  if I'm the teensiest bit thirsty, they taste terrible, so I have an early warning of dehydration. 

At a hundred and sixty-nine pounds and significantly less muscle, I throw out more mints than I eat, but every now and again I'm glad that I still carry mints.

Bananas are the canonical bike fuel.&nbsp;  They are low in water and therefore high in other nutrients, but don't make you thirsty.&nbsp;  Bananas come in an easy-open biodegradable wrapper that lets you eat them without touching your food with your filthy hands, bananas never dribble on your jersey, and bananas contain no pits to choke on when refueling too fast &mdash; you could swallow a banana without chewing it at all, if you had to. 

Bananas are so mild in flavor that many of the people who don't like them can eat them anyway. 

Most important, bananas are available at all seasons of the year, and almost every food store sells bananas &mdash; I've even seen them for sale in gas stations &mdash; so it's quite safe to get habituated to them. 

I used to carry a banana and a snack bag of nuts for lunch.&nbsp;  Bite the end of the banana flat, press one or more pieces of nut into the freshly-bitten surface, repeat.&nbsp;  This has a good balance of sugar, complex carbs, protein, and fat.

Y'know how when you are waiting for a car to get out of your way, you lead him a little?&nbsp;  That is, you start to get back into the saddle while he is still in front of you &mdash; or if he's moving fast and is on the other side of the street, before he even gets there &mdash; and by the time you get to the lane he is in, he's long gone. 

Don't EVER pull that stunt on a pedestrian.&nbsp;  When a pedestrian sees a vehicle start getting ready to move, he stops dead in his tracks. It's hard-wired on a subconscious level that a stationary target is easier to miss, and the reflex clicks in without consulting the cortex. 

If you were expecting to pass behind him, he will freeze in the exact center of your intended path.&nbsp;  Much confusion and embarrassment will ensue.

High Calorie Muffins 
    
    1 cup raw sunflower seeds 
    1 cup raisins 
    1 cup self-rising mixed edible powder 
    1 cup liquid (more or less) 
    sweetener to taste 
    
    Mix ingredients, divide among twelve or eighteen generously-oiled muffin tins, bake at 350&deg;F (or what whatever else you're baking takes) until done.  
    A cup of the syrup off canned fruit makes a good muffin.&nbsp;  Apple-juice concentrate makes the muffin unpleasantly tart.&nbsp;  A few overripe bananas instead of liquid make a very good muffin.&nbsp;  Honey is good when the powder is of delicate flavor; molasses is good with spices &mdash; but spiced muffins aren't good on the road. 
    Package in sandwich bags and freeze until wanted.&nbsp;  Muffins will keep two or three weeks in the freezer and about twelve hours at 90&deg;. 

    These muffins were my answer to a cyclist's need for small amounts of food at frequent intervals, and an old lady's need to be fed immediately when hungry. 

    ""Mixed edible powder"" is assorted thises and thats to taste:  soy flour and torula yeast for meat, kelp powder for vegetables, rose hip powder for fruit, malt flour for flavor, potato flour because I want to use it up, calcium carbonate because I don't want to put milk in something that may sit around for hours at incubator temperature, . . . , sufficient whole-wheat bread flour to make six cups, and two tablespoons of baking powder.&nbsp;  It makes good pancakes if it's at least two-thirds wheat flour.&nbsp;  Sift the powder from one bowl [or square of waxed paper] to another until thoroughly mixed.&nbsp;  An old-fashioned crank-type sifter is almost essential for this operation.&nbsp;  A half-gallon tea strainer will work.&nbsp;  A five-pound honey tin holds six cups of mix.&nbsp;  Mix keeps indefinitely if kept in an airtight container in the freezer, but might go rancid at room temperature. 
    White-flour muffins don't cotton to raisins and sunflower seeds, but a mix based on white flour can make good pancakes. 

<hr>
Washing eighteen muffin cups got old really fast.&nbsp;  I tried making bars by baking the batter in a cake pan and slicing it, but the cake didn't have sufficient tensile strength.&nbsp;  (Maybe more gluten in the self-rising mixed edible powder?)&nbsp;   Then I tried baking it sheet-cookie style, and the crust held the bars together.</lj-cut>"

While taking a recreational tour of Meijer after lunching at Panda Express on my way home from Goodwill, I found a display of single-serve envelopes of almond butter, bought one, and added it to my emergency snacks.&nbsp;  Which was rather silly, as it's useless without bread or crackers.&nbsp;  It was a reflex, left over from the days when I needed sandwich components that would keep for four hours at ninety degrees. 

In those days I usually carried High Calorie Muffins, and I'll post about that some day, but today I'll reminisce about sandwiches that don't go icky before lunch time. 

One trick was to put a slice of dried beef between two slices of bread and carry a small whole tomato.&nbsp;  Uncut tomatoes will keep good for days at room temperature, and love a couple of hours at ""crystals of salt all over my face"" temperature.&nbsp;  Find a picnic table or a shady spot, slice the tomato onto the salty beef, yum! 

Most fresh vegetables keep well when uncut.&nbsp;  I once bought some sweet peppers at a roadside stand, to the considerable improvement of my lunch. 

Once I took a single-serve can of chicken salad to spread on my bread. That didn't work out so well.&nbsp;  I open such cans with a can opener when I'm at home, so I wasn't in the habit of being very, very careful of the sharp microtooth saw that wrench-and-flip lids leave on the can. It was a very small cut, but bled like a stuck pig.&nbsp;  The bleeding stopped instantly when I pressed my thumb on the cut and held my hand over my head, but getting a band-aid out of my emergency kit while holding that position wasn't easy. 

To carry a beverage that would spoil if allowed to get warm, freeze a small amount in a container with a tight lid, fill the container just before leaving. 

Beverage ice cubes don't work; the good stuff freezes out of the beverage and sticks to the ice tray.

Alleys are pleasant to ride in because you hardly ever have to share them. 

But when you do meet someone in an alley, he is surprised to see you and may not do his share to avoid a collision.&nbsp;  If you are also surprised and not doing your share . . . 

There are twice as many intersections in alleys as on streets.&nbsp;  When you are on a street, you can pretty much ignore the alleys, but when you are in an alley, every alley is an intersection. 

When you cross a street, you will find that the people in the street are pretty much ignoring the alley.&nbsp;  Come to a full and complete stop and check carefully before crossing. 

Looking both ways is harder in alleys than in streets because the set-backs required by law are smaller on alleys than on streets -- and they are more likely to be ignored.&nbsp;  There's nothing wrong with setting a storage shed half an inch from the alley, because it isn't a building, it's lawn furniture.&nbsp;  Moreover, these sheds are set, by preference, in a corner of the lawn to keep them out of the way, which means that the most-likely location for a shed is right where it blocks your view of the other alley. 

Summary:  If you are a beginner, DON'T USE ALLEYS. 

If you are an expert, and you are tired, or hungry, or worried sick about something, DON'T USE ALLEYS.

A rank beginner is apt to flee from a street where cars are constantly overtaking and meeting him into the calm safety of a parking lot &mdash; but in a parking lot, the cars come at you from *every* direction.

Until you have a clue, get off and walk whenever you enter a parking lot.

I'm assuming that you already know how to walk across a parking lot &mdash; is that rash?

Beginners should not ride on streets where parking is allowed; there are skills that you must master before you can safely overtake a parked car.

Exception:&nbsp;   if the street is one where you wouldn't be surprised to meet a track team jogging down the middle, you may treat it as though it were a Multi-User Path, and use it to practice giving parked cars a wide berth.

But don't forget that Multi-User Paths require more alertness than streets do.

It has been brought to my attention that the art of parking on a pole is not hard-wired at birth, but must be learned. 

The process is very simple.&nbsp;  Stop near the pole, a few inches away so that the bike will lean against the pole and its center of gravity has to be raised a bit before it can be knocked over. 

The curve of the saddle should rest against the pole.&nbsp;  This prevents the bike from rolling forward. 

Nudge the pedal on your side with your foot until the pedal on the pole side rests firmly against the pole.&nbsp;  This prevents the bike from rolling backward. 

So now it can't roll, the pole prevents it from falling to one side, and the lean prevents it from falling to the other side.&nbsp;  The bike is stable. 

But sometimes a gust of wind (or a passing child) can give the bike enough of a push to overcome the weight pressing against the pole. Just to be sure, wind your cable lock around the pole and through the frame and both wheels. 

If the pole is one of a series intended for parking bikes &mdash; wavy pipes that provide several poles for each pair of expensive anchor points are popular &mdash; place your bike at right angles to the row of poles, so that you don't block other riders from using the other poles. 

If you want the bike locked, select a pole that is very tall, has something big at the top, or is a closed curve.&nbsp;  (A post supporting a roof usually meets all three criteria.)

There are times when stopping to rest means walking the rest of the way. 

Out in the country, you can often wait for a time when nobody is around and re-start across the road, turning the start into a switchback as you gain speed.&nbsp;  But in the bumper-to-bumper traffic on Guilderland Avenue as I climbed out of the Mohawk valley, this solution never occurred to me.&nbsp;  I knew that if I stopped, I walked, and it was miles to the top. 

(Leastways I remember it that way; I'm not going to ask Google Maps to measure the climb.&nbsp;  They aren't top maps, so I doubt that I could even if I were so inclined,) 

So I shifted into my lowest gear &mdash; which was pretty low; I left ""choose good gears"" out of the ""Take it Easy"" essay, but that's probably just as well, as I gather that modern clusters come pre-selected, which may explain the fad for absurd numbers of cogs. 

So I shifted my gears to granny and I shifted my attitude to ""I am climbing this hill.&nbsp;  I have always been climbing this hill.&nbsp;  I always will be climbing this hill.&nbsp;  Climbing this hill is the only possible state of affairs.""&nbsp;   When I got too tired to push, I concentrated on pulling the pedals up and let my feet fall of their own weight.&nbsp;  Of course I pushed some, if only to keep my balance, but I didn't think of that; I thought only pull, pull, pull. 

And somehow I always made it out of the valley, and when I got to the top, it wasn't any harder to ride from Schenectady to New Salem than it had been to ride from New Salem to Schenectady. 

-------------------------

Don't look up and say ""Oh, what a huge hill!  I must shift down some more.""  If the gear you are in now is just fine for the slope you are on now, it will continue to be just fine as that slope goes on and on and on. 

-------------------------

Sometimes walking is easier.&nbsp;  The driveway out of the fairgrounds (where there is a farmers' market every Saturday) rises sharply just before it meets the road.&nbsp;  I must come to a full and complete stop exactly where it would be a terrible strain to start moving again.&nbsp;  So I get off, use the crosswalk, and remount on the other side. 

I also get off to cross a road when I have to wait for a chance and the pavement is bad or I need to cross anti-bike curbs.&nbsp;  Getting off also reassures motorists that I'm not going to dash out randomly, and it makes it easier to move out between parked cars for a better view.

In rolling hills, you can use some of the energy spent climbing up one hill to help you climb the next hill.&nbsp;  When you top a hill, keep turning the pedals, but don't push very hard.&nbsp;  As you gain speed, tuck down in aerodynamic position.&nbsp;  When you are going so fast that it's uncomfortable to pedal, coast.&nbsp;  Watch for the moment when the next hill slows you enough to start pedalling gently again.&nbsp;  Shift a tad sooner than needed, but not so soon that you spin uncomfortably.&nbsp;  Odds are that you'll be more than halfway up before you run out of momentum. 

Don't use the above method on bad or unpredictable pavement, or places where visibility is poor. 

----------------------

Riding is easier than walking, so most of the times that you get too tired to continue climbing, it's better to rest for a while than to walk up the hill.&nbsp;  I was told to stand facing downhill while resting; what I actually do is to stay in the saddle, leaning heavily on the handlebars until I get my breath back. 

Well, I usually get bored, move off too soon, and end up resting again ten feet farther along. 

The best way to rest is, of course, flat on your back &mdash; ideally with your feet propped up on a wall or a tree.&nbsp;  But places where you can do that without attracting ambulances are vanishingly rare. 

The top of one hill where I used to live featured a park with a wide flat-topped wall that was very high on the parking side, and easy to jump up on from the picnic-table side; I was never disturbed while resting there. 

For some reason, people don't bother you if you rest in a cemetery, and cemeteries usually have shade trees.&nbsp;  (Check for poison ivy.) 

Passersby usually get the point when there is an entire racing team sprawled on the lawn.

The hills on one ride weren't as steep as I expected.&nbsp;  As I climbed, I wondered:&nbsp;  Is this a particularly easy route that I can recommend to others, or are my quads building up faster than I had hoped? 

I concluded that the main factor was that my two previous rides had been a little longer than I thought I was ready for, so I'd recently had a lot of intense practice in taking it easy on myself. 

----------

Just going slow won't do it.&nbsp;  You can ride so fast that you fall over in exhaustion before the end of the first mile &mdash; and you can ride so slowly that you fall over in exhaustion before the end of the first mile.&nbsp;  (Well, a track cyclist could ride that slow; most of us would fall over for other reasons.)&nbsp;  Somewhere in between there is a sweet spot, and only experience can tell you what speed is least tiring. 

The optimum speed varies with time of day, terrain, current condition, what you've eaten lately, and everything else.&nbsp;  Fortunately, once you have had experience, you can tell cruising speed from too fast and too slow continuously. 

----------

One rule of taking it easy is don't strain, don't strain, don't strain.&nbsp;  Shift down a little sooner than you absolutely have to, switchback when you could still keep climbing straight, rest when you come to a comfortable place. 

But sometimes a tiny bit of peak exertion can save a lot of low-level exertion.&nbsp;  You have to learn to recognize those times, save the overdrive for when you need it, and space out the efforts so that you'll be recovered when you need to do it again. 

----------

Since this essay is already too long, I'll make my comments on hills into a separate post.

A serving of the jam pudding called ""fruit-flavored yogurt"" is a good way to get a quick shot of sugar when you stop at a grocery store.&nbsp;  Get full-fat ""yogurt"" if at all possible, and read the label carefully to be sure there is no non-nutritive sweetener in it. 

I wrap a clear-plastic disposable spoon in a paper towel and stash it in my tool kit; with that and my pocket knife, I'm pretty well set to eat anything I buy along the way. 

Once, when I didn't have a spoon with me, I bought a cup of yogurt and a box of crackers, and used the crackers to dip up the yogurt. 

Plain tortilla chips are also pretty good with sweet stuff, and corn is very glycemic.

When I was at the Burlington Bike Shop between Nappanee and Bremen, I saw folding wire panniers just like mine except that the bottom panel is the currently-fashionable perforated sheet metal instead of wires. This leads me to think that there might be people who can use my method of making a cooler out of newspaper. 

Folding wire panniers were originally designed to fit standard paper grocery bags.&nbsp;  By happy chance, this makes them fit standard newspapers, so all you need to make one into a cooler are newspapers and plastic grocery bags. 

The description is written for very thin newspapers; if your paper is thick, you may need to use sections instead of whole papers. 

Being a serious cyclist, I always carry a bag of crumpled grocery bags to use as packing material when I buy something fragile.&nbsp;  When I started doing that, I figured that every now and again the bags would get in my way and I'd toss them into the nearest trash bin, but it seems that when my panniers fill up, I use a lot of packing material &mdash; and if there are bags left over, a bag of bags on top of a piled-up pannier serves to wedge everything down and protect items from the pressure of the bungee cords. 

---------------  side trip 

It is possible to fold a plastic grocery bag so flat that it takes up almost no space at all. 

This is easier done than said; don't let the complicated instructions scare you. 

Take hold of the ends of the seam at the bottom and pull to straighten it out.&nbsp;  Repeat for the seams in the handles.&nbsp;  The second step is harder, because the handles have usually been scrunched. 

Put a finger in one handle and a finger of the other hand into the pleat at the bottom of the bag and pull.&nbsp;  The bag will straighten out and the pleats will re-form.&nbsp;  Repeat on the other side. 

Stroke from the bottom of the bag toward the opening to drive out the air, then fold the bag in half lengthwise and stroke again.&nbsp;  Fold again and stroke again. 

The average-size bag is narrow enough at this stage.&nbsp;  Put the palm of one hand on the bottom seam and flatten the bag with the other hand, then fold it in half crosswise.&nbsp;  Flatten again, fold again. 

When I build a cooler, the first step is to shingle the bottom of the pannier with bags flattened in this manner.&nbsp;  (There are usually already bags there from the last time, since there is no reason to remove them when I remove the cooler.) 

I put bags under my cooler so that when I wedge all of my crumpled bags down between things, then buy one more item, I can reach up between the wires and pull out a bag to tie the extra item to the rack with.&nbsp;  This would be quite impossible if the bottom of the pannier were fine mesh like the panniers at Burlington, so . . . um . . . delete this entire section. 

---------------  /side trip 


To begin the cooler, line a pannier with a plastic grocery bag, to keep wind from blowing between the newspapers.&nbsp;  This is akin to the ""wind shell"" that used to be worn over down sweaters. 

If none of your bags is large enough, line the pannier with smaller bags that you have squashed flat, so that you can use them like small, irregular pieces of sheet plastic.&nbsp;   (The squashing needn't be neat; wrinkles add insulation.)  Choose white bags if you have any, to turn the sun. 

Put a bag in each corner, the straightest part even with the top wire and the middle of the bag pressed into the corner, with the handles of the bag straggling across the bottom of the pannier.&nbsp;  Then arrange more bags overlapping the first four to fill up the gaps. 

Next, take a newspaper folded the way papers are in paper dispensers, hold the fold against the top wire of one side of the pannier, and use your other hand to force it to fold into the corner between side and bottom.&nbsp;  Line the other side with another newspaper. 

At one time, the next step was to fold a newspaper in half, but papers are narrower than they used to be, so fold about a third of the paper to make it just a tiny bit wider than the end of the pannier.&nbsp;  Place it with the new fold in the corner and the old fold even with the top wire, then force the rest of it to fit.&nbsp;  This wedges the side newspapers into place.&nbsp;  Put another newspaper in the other end. 

If the insulation isn't thick enough, add another layer of newspaper.&nbsp;  At the ends, line up the thin side of the new layer with the thick side of the first layer. 

If you lined the pannier with a single large bag, fold it down over the first layer so that the second layer can hold it in place. 

At first, I folded a newspaper in half and wedged it down on the floor to hold the sides in place, then I noticed that the floor was already at least as thick as the sides and stopped doing that. 

Now line the completed cooler with another plastic bag; since the inside measurements are now smaller, odds are you have one that's big enough.&nbsp;  This helps to keep the newspapers dry, and also allows you to carry everything you packed into the cooler into the house in one trip. 

After filling the cooler, fold the lining bag over the contents and put in a newspaper folded in half as a lid.&nbsp;  Then use your bag of crumpled bags to fill up the pannier, and use two bungees to hold it down.&nbsp;  (The space between the newspaper lid and the bag of crumpled bags is a good place to stash things you want kept out of the sun, but not chilled.) 

To make a bungee lid on a wire pannier, put the ends of the bungees through the wires from the inside out, one bungee end on each side of the hinge wires of the pannier end, just below the top wire, so that the bungee is held by its middle and both ends dangle outside the pannier.&nbsp;  Bring the hooks up over the top wire and hook them to the other end.&nbsp;  Repeat with the other bungee at the other end. 

If the bungee is too long, span more than one wire.&nbsp;  If you pile up more stuff than the bungees can stretch over, hook two of the hooks to each other, so that three strands of bungee make a Z.

Now and again you see a sign telling you that it's legal to ride your bike on a sidewalk.&nbsp;  It may even be a special sidewalk on which curbs and steps have been replaced with ramps. 

It's still a sidewalk.&nbsp;  When you ride on a sidewalk, you are totally and all by yourself responsible for avoiding collisions at intersections, because the drivers of cars don't see you.&nbsp;  Hardly anybody checks the sidewalk for moving vehicles, and even if you are seen, you won't be noticed &mdash; a person on a sidewalk is nothing unusual or relevant to car-driving.&nbsp;  His eyes won't linger on you long enough to notice that you aren't moving like a pedestrian. 

As if that weren't enough, every driveway and alley that crosses the sidewalk is an intersection.&nbsp;  On a street, a driver will stop short of the crosswalk before creeping across the walkway to look for traffic, but when he is emerging from a driveway or alley, he will pull out to where he can see the street with almost no attention to the sidewalk. 

<hr>

City planners often see no reason not to direct bicycles up the wrong way of a one-way street.&nbsp;  A white stripe may help in the middle of the block, but at the intersection, someone turning into the one-way street is NOT going to be prepared to see someone coming toward him. 

<hr>

The powers that be get a big thrill out of building multi-user pathways and putting up signs that say ""Bikeway"". 

Somewhere in the world, there is a bikeway.&nbsp;  It has sidewalks. 

A multi-user path is a walkway on which people are permitted to play with wheel toys.&nbsp;  When you ride on one, you must use all the precautions that you would use when riding on a sidewalk. 

Bend over backward to avoid causing annoyance or alarm to pedestrians; dismount if you have to.&nbsp;  Speak before you overtake.&nbsp;  Watch for dog leashes stretched across the path.&nbsp;  And, no matter how lightly-traveled the pathway is, never, never put your head down and sprint.&nbsp;  You might run down a toddler or crash into a gate.&nbsp;  If you must sprint, at least watch where you are going.

The sharper the angle at which you strike an obstacle, the more likely it is to steer the bicycle out from under you.&nbsp;  Brushing against a curb that's almost parallel to your velocity is a guaranteed fall, if you aren't both very lucky and possessed of a track racer's supernatural balance. 

So if you see a flaw in the pavement and have no alternative to riding over it, come as close to hitting it at right angles as you can. 

A drop-off is less likely to steer the bike than a bump, so line up for the far edge of a hole and the near edge of a bump. 

Some, BUT NOT ALL, of the curbs that are used to block the entrances of driveways, alleys, and parking lots are sloped gently enough that you can treat them as short, sharp hills:  striking one of these at a sharp angle is equivalent to switchbacking.&nbsp;  But don't switchback a curb when there is another moving vehicle anywhere in the neighborhood unless you are absolutely, positootly certain that he can -- and will -- miss you if you fall.

Bleeding blacks have a variant of the Xanth zombie spell:&nbsp;    No matter how many times you wash them, they have more dye.

So if your poorly-dyed black garment hasn't bled completely white, keep on rinsing the sweat out of your clothes in two separate buckets.

    I tend to forget that one can wash with water carried for drinking &mdash; and it comes in a handy squirt bottle that's convenient for flushing grit out of road rash. 
    
    It's less convenient for washing hands &mdash; I can squirt only one hand at a time. 
    
    There should be a sliver of soap in your first-aid kit.&nbsp;   (This doubles as a way to mark your tire for thorn-finding purposes, if you weren't forethoughty enough to line the valve stem up with the tire label.) 
    
    If an ambulance is on its way, leave wound-cleaning to the professionals.

One day I rode my bike to the grocery.&nbsp;  After I'd returned my cart, a man I passed on my way back to my bike said ""I see that you are wearing a helmet.&nbsp;  I wear a helmet too.&nbsp;  Helmets are very important."" 

I hear ""helmets are important"" a lot, but on a list of important bicycle safety equipment, helmets would come in no higher than twentieth. 


(1)	First and foremost among safety equipment is correctly tightened nuts and bolts.&nbsp;  A bike that falls apart while you are riding it can ruin your whole day. 


A number of second-place items, in the order that I happen to think of them: 

(2)	Handlebars firmly connected to your front wheel, so that you can steer the bike. 


(3)	Brakes:   check that they are present, appropriate, properly adjusted, brake blocks not worn clear off. 


(4)	Leather-palm gloves.&nbsp;  Sooner or later, you are going to fall, and when you fall, you are hard-wired to put out your hand to save yourself.&nbsp;   Even ordinary road grit embedded in your palm can make it difficult to continue, and Murphy guarantees that you'll land on the only piece of broken glass in ten miles.&nbsp;  Glass will slice right through leather, but probably will be slowed enough to save your tendons.&nbsp;   (Gloves should fit very tightly to prevent ""glove stopped, hand didn't"" abrasions.)  

Gloves also protect you from the handlebars. 


(5)	At least two bottle cages.&nbsp;  The first sign of dehydration is stupidity, and sometimes stupidity is fatal.&nbsp;  (On a flatfoot/crank forward bike, one cage will suffice.) 


(6)	Bottles.&nbsp;  Empty  cages don't help much. 


(7)	Fresh water in the bottles.&nbsp;   You must see to this before every ride, no matter how brief.&nbsp;  Take the first sip as you are rolling out the driveway &mdash; this sets the proper rhythm, and also notifies you that you forgot to clean the bottles while you can still go back and do something about it. 


(8)	Properly-built wheels.&nbsp;  You don't want to be stranded out in the boonies with a broken spoke. 


(9)	Properly-mounted wheels.&nbsp;  A wheel with a missing spacer can roll just fine until you stand up on the pedals to evade some danger. 


(10)	Tires in good condition, properly mounted.&nbsp;  *Usually* a failed tire is only an inconvenience but if an improperly-mounted front tire blows off the rim at a critical moment . . . 


(11)	Spare tube, frame pump, and a tube-repair kit.&nbsp;   Mostly just saves you annoyance, but can save you from a long walk if you flat where there is no taxi service. 


(12)	Sound drivetrain:  pedals, chainwheels, cranks, cogs, etc. You know that if a drivetrain fails, it's going to fail when you're pushing extra hard, and that's not likely to be a convenient time to lose power. 

Luckily, it's very rare for a correctly-installed chain to break. 

(Not impossible, though.&nbsp;  You'd be amazed at how far a road bike can draisine up a hill even though one can use only one foot to propel it.)  


(13)	Visible clothing &mdash; <i>please</i> don't go out after dark dressed all in black. 


(14)	Reflectors, white in front and red in back.&nbsp;  Even if you don't plan to go out after dark, you might be delayed, and reflectors are a cheap back-up.&nbsp;  Get real reflectors from an auto-parts store; special bike reflectors often reflect only in the middle third. 

Reflectors on the sides of a bicycle are purely symbolic.&nbsp;   Reflectors work only when headlights are aimed directly at them.&nbsp;   If you are side-on to a headlight beam and far enough away that the driver can do something about having seen you, you will be out of the headlight beam by the time he gets there. 


(15)	A white light in front and a red light in back.&nbsp;  If you want to be seen from the side after dark, or if you want a driver to know that he is about to pull out of a side road into your path, you *must* glow with your own light. 

It is also important that the lights be the correct colors so that other operators can tell which way you are going without waiting to watch you move.&nbsp;  A yellow light can be seen from farther away, but you need a red light too &mdash; and make sure the red light isn't a tight beam pointed straight back.&nbsp;  A red light is most important when seen from the side, so make sure that it *can* be seen from the side. 


(16)	Rear view mirror.&nbsp;  Don't get one until <i>after</i> you've mastered the art of looking back.&nbsp;  A mirror can't tell you when it's safe, but knowing when it's <i>not</i> safe is very valuable information. 

Well, the helmet sneaks in early &mdash; a helmet is the most-convenient place to put a rear-view mirror.&nbsp;  It also helps to distinguish you from a pedestrian in the minds of passing motorists, so I guess it sneaked in even earlier under ""visible clothing"". 


(17)	A luggage rack, preferably fitted with panniers.&nbsp;   This is particularly important on a child's bike:  if you don't give a child a safe way to carry things, he's going to carry things anyway, probably in his hand, or tied to his handlebars where they interfere with steering. 


(18)	<s>a dime</s>&nbsp;&nbsp; <s>a quarter</s>&nbsp;&nbsp; a cell phone. 


(19)	and for close-up calls for help:  if you can't scream real loud, carry a whistle.&nbsp;  When you need help, scream (or whistle) in sets of three.&nbsp;  ""Did I hear something?&nbsp;  Yes, I did.&nbsp;  And it's coming from that direction.""  

Three is the smallest number that can be equally spaced and therefore unmistakably a signal, so three is nearly always a feature of official distress calls.&nbsp;  One yelp will be dismissed as children playing, two yelps are random noise, but three equally-spaced yelps, repeated over and over, mean Something Is Wrong. 

On an off-topic but related note:&nbsp;   When you find someone lying on the ground, there are three steps to take:  (1)  Look around to make sure that whatever got him won't get you.&nbsp;  (2) verify that he isn't just taking a nap.&nbsp;  (3) shriek ""help help help"" as loud as you can. 

<i>Then</i> you can start to render first aid. 


(20)	And yes, if you should happen to bump your head, it's probably a good idea to have a piece of foam over it &mdash; even better if there's a stiff shell over the foam to spread the force over a wider area. 

The most-important part of a helmet is the chin strap:&nbsp;   It doesn't matter how good the helmet is if it isn't on your head. 

Proper fit is also essential &mdash; no chin strap can keep a loose helmet on your head, and if a helmet is too small, it won't be on your head in the first place &mdash; a foam fascinator perched on top won't do any good, unless maybe it deflects a wrench somebody dropped while you were walking under a ladder. 

Then you must put the helmet on in such fashion that your brain is inside it &mdash; too many ""helmets"" merely decorate the back of the head, leaving the most-important parts of the brain fully exposed.&nbsp;  The brim of a helmet must be level when you are standing straight, and you should be able to see the brim by rolling your eyes up. 

Chin straps slip, so a child's helmet should be inspected at intervals to make sure it still sits on the head properly.&nbsp;   Be aware that a child sometimes thinks it kewl to help a chin strap slip. 

If you use a helmet-mounted rear-view mirror, your helmet gets checked for proper alignment every time you look back.&nbsp;  If you don't, put your helmet on in front of a mirror whenever one is handy &mdash; shop windows frequently serve &mdash; and roll your eyes up to look at the brim whenever it occurs to you that you haven't used a mirror recently.

I'm too tired to write tonight, so I'll just natter a bit.

Last Wednesday, I drove to a grocery store and went for a ride for the first time since we moved here in 2001. 

I was surprised to realize that that meant that I had to carry both my bike keys and my car keys.&nbsp;  Made it hard to get at the sunscreen etc. that I carry in the same pocket.&nbsp;  Not to mention that I always got out the wrong set of keys first. 

I think that back when buying groceries in a distant town was a weekly event, I carried all my keys on one ring.&nbsp;  But since then we've bought a vehicle that has a radio transmitter among its keys, and the house key and folding scissors accompanying my bike key have been joined by nail clippers, two knives, a six-foot tape measure, and eight frequent-customer cards. 

To think that once upon a time the bike key was the only key, and I had a blue key made so it would look nice on a chain around my neck. I've worn out two locks since then. 

That was long before I started keeping a safety pin on my key ring. That started when my car keys fell out of my pocket while I was trying to take a nap on a very narrow bench in the warming bus during a night fire.&nbsp;  Luckily, my spouse had brought his keys, and the boys found my keys when they cleaned the bus. 

A while after we moved, I noticed that what I'd thought was a key to the house didn't open any door in the house.&nbsp;  But the key had to be to something important.&nbsp;  I carried it for years, and finally realized that it was a very important key indeed.&nbsp;  It was the key to a firehouse seven hundred miles away, which is no longer a firehouse. 

I wonder whether there is still a kitchen on the second floor. 

Just a few weeks ago, I went to the bead shop and bought a package of brass ""lobster-claw clasps"".&nbsp;  Now all the tools on my key ring are detachable.

Make an unshakeable habit of putting the valve cap in your pocket whenever you inflate a tire.&nbsp;  If you forget to put it back on, at least you'll have it with you, and small parts in your pocket never get bumped off the tube'n'tool tote and roll into a ditch. 

The muffin-tin trick is quite acceptable when you are taking something apart in the comfort of your own workshop, but if you don't have a table to set it on, a container of loose parts is sooner or later gonna get kicked.

I read somewhere on the Web that if you haven't got a wringer, you can press water out of wet clothing with a rolling pin:&nbsp;  Simply lay the clothes out flat and roll the pin over them. 

The source said ""a plastic table"" &mdash; I'd use my wooden picnic table, because the expressed water is going to drip all over, and it would be nice not to have to mop it up. 

I once stayed in a mountain cabin that had a wooden counter that also served as the drainboard of the sink; that would be an ideal place to roll water out of wet cloth. 

This trick might be useful when you've come in out of the rain, or when you come home dripping with sweat and rinse your clothes in a bucket. 

Better make it two buckets &mdash; one for the black stuff and one for the rest.

(written 23 June 2015)

Tragically, one day I bungeed a plastic grocery bag of emergency stuff to the outside of a pannier without tying the handles through the wires. 

I'd been refining that kit for decades, and I'd just made a spiffy new case for the tools.&nbsp;   <a href=""http://wlweather.net/pagesew/BIKE_KIT/BIKEROLL.HTM"">http://wlweather.net/pagesew/BIKE_KIT/BIKEROLL.HTM </a>

This morning I realized that one thing I haven't added to the regenerating tool kit is a lip-salve box filled with Eucerin Original Healing (the hand-lotion you can slice).&nbsp;  So where do I get a lip-salve box now that lip salve comes only in sticks?&nbsp;  Perhaps the screw-top nail-art boxes they sell at Sally's Beauty Supply would do (but what do I do with the other five boxes in the package?) 

I have some drop-dispenser bottles, and could substitute olive oil &mdash; but I had a <em>very</em> good reason to stop carrying liquids in my tool kit. 

Oh, well, these days I fix my flats with a cell phone anyway.

I've heard of people who clean their hands with gasoline after working on their bikes.&nbsp;  Ew, gross, ick!&nbsp;   *Any* grease or oil will take chain grease off; you don't have to use a solvent that stinks to high heaven, poses a fire hazard, and strips enough fat out of your skin to leave you with a medical condition. 

I used to use abrasive soap, but it doesn't dissolve grease as well as grease does. 

I generally use olive oil, because there's a bottle next to the microwave, and the kitchen is only one door from the garage.&nbsp;  Before I started cooking with olive oil, there was usually a skillet of used fat sitting around. 

Special containers of ""mechanic's hand cleaner"" are available; the smallest can of Crisco works just as well. 

All work the same way:&nbsp;    grab a glob of grease, rub it into the stain, rub it off with a paper towel, repeat until clean &mdash; or, out on the road, until you don't mind touching stuff. 

-------------------

At that point I stopped writing and went for a twenty-five mile ride. Happened to pass Sally's Beauty Supply on the way back, but they have discontinued the empty boxes.&nbsp;  Maybe I can find something suitable in the craftsy-waftsy department at Walmart.&nbsp;  (Or I might find an old lip-salve box if I cleaned out all my drawers.)&nbsp;   I must also check pill-box displays. 

-------------------

Before getting around to posting this, I found a sample packet of hand lotion left over from when I was a Fuller Brush Man.&nbsp;  It still squished, so I added it to the emergency kit.

Always check your mirror immediately after a motor vehicle passes you.&nbsp;  There might be another hidden in its noise. 

That includes low-flying airplanes!&nbsp;  (Luckily, the driver of the truck that I didn't see saw me.)

Never pass a water fountain without topping off your bottles, even if you've taken only a few sips since the last fountain. 

Always taste water before mixing it with good water. 

Tasting first doesn't always help.&nbsp;  When touring Saratoga, I stopped at a mineral spring, noted that the water tasted better than what I'd brought from the hotel, emptied my bottles and refilled them.&nbsp;  Then half an hour later, when the water had warmed to the ambient temperature . . .

This post is late because I was too tired to write when I came home yesterday &mdash; so tired that I woke up with a gray spot on my calf this morning. 

Well, I forgot the chain grease when I was showering partly because that was only the second time I didn't wear long pants this spring, and partly because it rained heavily during the last half mile of the ride and I was in a big hurry to get my clothes off. 

But that gives me a topic:&nbsp;  when you lather up the black spot and rinse it off, it turns gray &mdash; then you have to scrub really hard to get the rest of it off and your calf is red instead of black. 

Well, it's that way for me.&nbsp;  Younger folks with greasier skin might shed the dirt more easily. 

Go to a beauty-supply store and buy one of the hard plastic sponges that they sell as cheap substitutes for pumice stones.&nbsp;  Mine is labeled ""pumice contour"" and has a logo of a weightlifter named ""Mr. Pumice."" 

After washing your leg, rub soap on the gray spot and rub soap on the wet ""pumice"".&nbsp;  One or two light strokes and poof! the grease is gone, with no skin irritation.

I'm always seeing reminders that cars should give bicycles four feet of clearance when overtaking, but I seldom see a reminder that bicycles should give cars four feet of clearance. 

Ample clearance is particularly important when the car is parked.&nbsp;  A moving car seldom throws open a door, nicks the end of your handlebar, and steers the bike out from under you, whereupon you fall under the wheels of a bus. 

Example: 

There is, not too far from my house, a street with two lanes exactly wide enough for cars, and two bike lanes that look to be about a yard wide. 

(I haven't actually measured the bike lanes in this stretch.&nbsp;  About half a mile further out, I measured the other bike lane at sixty-nine inches including two four-inch white stripes in one place, and fifty-four (again including stripes) in another.) 

Three observations:  An overtaking car cannot pass a bicycle in the bike lane without taking part of the oncoming lane.&nbsp;  Traffic in the oncoming lane is nearly continuous.&nbsp;  Good pavement extends well beyond the edge of the ""bike lane"". 

When eastbound on this stretch of road, I ride just outside the bike lane.

If you frequently freeze water in a plastic container that wasn't designed for it, the expansion of the ice will sooner or later crack the container at the mold mark.&nbsp;  You can get around this by filling a bottle a little at a time, tipping the bottle to maximize the surface area of the water when you put it into the freezer.&nbsp;  Tipping also keeps the ice from getting a square push. 

Freezing bottles became much easier after I found a valve-cap that fits the bottles that ""spring water"" comes in.&nbsp;  Disposable bottles also allow me to build up a stock of frozen beverage without buying a lot of California Springs bottles. 

If a bottle which had been entirely frozen now has a few drops of water in it, pour them out on the ground.&nbsp;  They will contain every molecule of salt that was in the water.

I've only a tad over a mile and a half to ride after buying groceries these days, so I don't fret if a bottle of milk ends up in the other pannier from the rest of the cold stuff.&nbsp;  Sometimes I slide a bag into a pannier and leave it the way the bag-boy packed it. 

One of my quarter-century rides has a place where I can buy a pound of cheese at the turn-around point.&nbsp;  On these occasions, I insulate one of my panniers with newspapers and plastic bags, and carry my extra water in quart bottles filled with ice cubes.&nbsp;  Keeps my lunch cold on the way out, my cheese cold on the way back.&nbsp;  And refilling one's bottle with ice water goes a long way toward encouraging hydration:  I pour only a half-cup or so into my bottle at a time, and try to drink it before it gets warm. 

I used to live in a place where the nearest supermarket was in the next town, and the return route averaged uphill.&nbsp;  On a hot day, food might have become not just warm, but rotten, if I had packed as I do now.&nbsp;  I went to the market seldom enough that I wanted every cubic inch for groceries; carrying ice and insulation wasn't an option. 

So at every trip, I would buy a can of frozen juice, pack the cold stuff around it, and insulate it with the shelf-stable stuff and any spare clothing I might be carrying.&nbsp;  At home I would put the juice in the fridge to finish thawing, and mix it up the following day.&nbsp;  (That was when I learned that juice is *much* easier to reconstitute if you thaw it first.) 

In those days I had a luxury that is no longer available:&nbsp;  paper grocery bags were still common, and plastic bags were the same size as the paper bags.&nbsp;  My panniers are designed to fit a standard grocery bag.&nbsp;  So I'd put a paper bag into a plastic bag, line my pannier with the combination, and put another plastic bag in so the paper wouldn't get wet.&nbsp;  The plastic made the package slick to slide down into the pannier, and provided handles to pull it out again.&nbsp;  The paper made it stiff so groceries wouldn't stick out between the wires and lock the package into the pannier. 

This was so convenient that I didn't replace my wire panniers with my nylon panniers for multi-day tours: I would line a pannier with paper and plastic, line the paper with another plastic, put in stuff I wouldn't want until later on, fold down the bag, put another plastic bag in, pack the next layer, and so forth.&nbsp;  When the pannier was full, I'd drape a plastic bag over my luggage and tuck it between the outermost bag and the wires all around.&nbsp;  Once I was caught in rain so heavy that I couldn't see to get off the road, but everything in my panniers was bone dry when I unpacked at the hostel that night. 

And it's loads of fun to check into a fancy hotel with grocery bags for luggage!&nbsp;  (They don't turn a hair, actually, just summon a bell boy to carry the bike up the stairs.)

I have mastered the art of folding a canvas bag neatly so that it doesn't take up much space in my pannier. 

Now I need to master the art of remembering to take it into the store with me. 

Tip:&nbsp;   If you need to go back to your bike, leave your cart next to the restrooms so the cart boy won't clean it out and put it away.  

Leaving personal property in the cart isn't enough; he will turn it in to lost and found.

Safety on a shared roadway is achieved entirely by communication:&nbsp;  you tell other operators what you are going to do, and they tell you what they are going to do. 

When you are learning a new language, memorizing vocabulary and grammar help &mdash; but actual learning takes place only when you go out and communicate. 

There is no substitute for on-the-road experience.

You should have a sheet of twist ties in your wallet or card case. You never know when a little piece of wire will come in handy."

When wool tights went out of fashion, I had to make do with sweat pants.  

Sweat pants are too long as purchased.&nbsp;  I have learned the hard way that it's a bad idea to shorten anything before it's been washed, and I didn't want to wash them until after they had gotten dirty.&nbsp;  Well, pants that are pinned close around the ankles aren't going to draggle or get tripped over, and I can push the excess up above my knees and put garters just below the knees. 

When pants are short enough to walk in, pinning leaves a gap that I usually cover with gaiters; too-long pants can be brought right down to the tops of my shoes.&nbsp;  And that doesn't leave all that much to be held up; if I'm not wearing multiple layers, I can sometimes dispense with the garters. 

So now all my winter cycling pants are too long to walk in.

When I put a plastic bag of stuff into my panniers, I usually tie the handles to the panniers, so that it won't bounce out when I hit a bump, or spill if I fall.&nbsp;  If I want the stuff to stay put and not jiggle, I put both handles through the same hole in the wire panniers, pull until the stuff is snug and non-shifting, then tie the handles through a different hole.  

Panniers can be piled up without losing stuff if the stuff can't jiggle.

There's a lot of discussion on what to drink, what temperature it should be, and so forth &mdash; but the important question is ""can you get it inside the patient?"".&nbsp;  The best hydrating fluid is something that you like and will drink lots of."

Before each ride, lift your bike slightly and drop it.&nbsp;   You will quickly learn what sound it makes when nothing is loose. 

If you have a bunch of heavy stuff in your panniers, bounce each tire separately."

"event","<lj-cut text=""A joke turns useful"">A few weeks ago, I dined out, enjoyed my meal so much that I forgot to fidget, and found my legs extremely stiff when I stood up.&nbsp;  I said ""I'm not sure I can walk"" and did my impression of Tim Conway's impression of a little old man.&nbsp;  To do this, you stand up straight, slide one foot forward an inch, slide the other foot forward an inch, and repeat very, very fast.&nbsp;  It's funnier than a tank running over a Cadillac. 

After a foot or so of travel, I stopped to giggle &mdash; and discovered that all the cramps were gone.&nbsp;  Ever since, I've been doing the Tim Conway shuffle whenever I thought my muscles needed shaking up &mdash; and, I've found, doing it the full length of a vinyl runner that one is trying to flatten can actually get one a little out of breath. 

Non-skid slipper socks mess it all up. 

A slow-motion version works on ice, if one has one's cane firmly planted.

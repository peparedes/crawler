"event","well here i am with 10 mins to spare before im off to class. So nothing has changed well i lie some things have changed..  

1)I have now found out that i can't graduate in may because my advisors thought that i was pre-health this whole time so i have been taking classes that i didnt need instead of the ones i was supose to. And i can't really lie to ya i can graduate in may if my professor lets me take 152 over the summer but i dotn see that happening..

2) i have noticed when you are single and your friends or not that they dont care about you as much well some of them. They are to far up the other ones butt to know that your not there.. well i guess im starting to grow up and i realized i don't really need these people to survive but i will sit back and watch there doom because they will never last.

3)School grades are doing well for a change hehehe. I got my ass in gear. not that i care.. i wanted to go to graduate school and not i have decided that its not worth the money i want to be a wife and  a mother and i want to do it before my mother did. I want to be the COOOOOL mom but still strict.. But i got to find the guy to give me my kids.... any takers

4) My Father is doing well. I mean he has its ups and downs but the funny thing is he can tell my mom off now and its great .. i don't think she knows what to do .. heheheh getting back at ya mom ..

5) on the Mom note she needed surgery then she didn't then she did.. so we are now waiting to see what is going on ... i just keep telling herer to get the surgery it would make things 10 times better and plus its out of the way.

6) Well today i'm leaving for PA and i won't be back till sunday and it will be a very relaxing trip.. i can't wait for classes to be over today ... MIKE HERE I COME AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME!!!

"event","Well my life is crazy as always. I don't know if I'm coming or going. And at times I'm glad this is how it is then i don't have to really deal with what i call REALITY. What reality is is that my life feels like its in shambles. My father is still in the hospital after 3 weeks and he is getting better he will never be normal. He may even die from the disorder he has so, my faith has down shifted to why me. My mother is so stressed about the situation I'm trying to keep her happy and smiling.
I'm taking only 13 credit hours this semester and I'm thinking of dropping them all and with drawing i just don't know how to handle them right now and how to handle life. My classes aren't extremely hard they just take up a lot of my time and since ans you can tell I'm depressed it takes up to much time. i don't have enough time just to sit and cry to myself or sulk in my own misery. Most people would think that is a good thing me on the other hand thinks its bad. 
Then on the guy note you know how you like that one special guy but there is no way in hell you will ever get him and the worst part is hes one of your best friends that is always there for you. And it hurts you to be around him but you want to be around him. And the topper of all is that he has a girlfriend that is great and treats him right and they will probably end up together . So all you can do is dream about what you want and never get it . Instead you get all the losers that just want to fuck you and leave. o well welcome to my world.
well the worse part of the whole situation is you are afraid to tell people how you feel because of how they will react or respond to what you say. i feel that my friends are loyal but i don't know if they would understand or be supportive to what i want to do or even listen to my .. i know some of them won't the other will just try to change my fuckin mind. I just want some one there no mater what. i want some one to be behind me if if i fuck up. Date the wrong person and it turns in to a fight. i mean come on what can i do who can i be it feels like no mater what i do and feel some one is trying to run it. I'm tired of it . I'm tired of being me. I really don't want to be in the world but i also know that God put me here for a reason. i just want him to get his reason over with so i can get out of the drama and the bullshit i deal with inside. I hate life and if i wasn't scared of not dieing i would commit suicide but the thing is i tried that and as you can tell i didn't succeed very well i just failed again even though I'm always told that i didn't fail i suceeded because i got another chance at life to me thats failure. well i know who ever reads this will think I'm psycho and that i need counseling .. to late already getting it and as you can tell it doesn't fucking work well i better get to my useless class that all its going to do is depress me more yeah..

rest in peace everyone  or pray that i do soon"

"event","Well haven't written in a while. Figured i would say whats going on in my life. Not that they are important. 

First off of course school is killing me. I just cant wait till this semester is over.  I don't want to come back but i know that would be stupid. I'm just really burnt out right now. i have a year left and i don't know if i'm going to make it.. it seams forever away.   

On the guy note .. of course i'm always confused and always with another guy i mean come on no guy wants to stick around long enough or i don't want to stay with them long enough to get to attached .. What can i say i'm afraid of commitment.. surprise! surprise! and of course the guys i want to commit to wont do it .. there is always some issue that keeps them away .. i guess i will be single forever but i guess thats not so bad i don't have to share that way right.

on the family note mom and dad are doing well but my extended family seams to always be dying .. i have a cousin that had terminal cancer and a great uncle that is on his death bed. A funeral always helps some one who's down on them selves.. NOT!!   

well since this is really going nowhere i will let you guys that read this get back you your lives.


To my friends I Love you and thanks for being there for em though this rough time"

"event","Well every day seams the same .. its like the saying same shit different day.. and i dont mean this with just work i mean it with life.. everyday some one gets mad about soemthing and everyday its seams like i cant get something right.. Cant we all just be mature and talk about things i mean come on.. i dont know maybe one day i will learn that people arent the type to talk they are the type to get pissed tell you off then run to there corner and hide.. i rather people just state im pissed off and i want to tell u why. and then tell me why. And when i respond to why they are mad them listen to me and try to understand me but that doesnt work.. i know im not a perfect person and i know i dotn wnat to me i just wish at times that people are so hypicrical and so arguementive .. but i guess that is life.. its confusing and over welming at times but everyone can get through it if they try hard enought.. A quote that i think kinda goes with this is : One makes Mistakes: That is life  but it is never a mistake to have loved.. By Romain Rolland

well to update on other stuff. my intern ship is almost done thank GOD.. i went to the hospital  this weekend to do rounds with the Pa-C and the Dr and well satuerday i was there 13 and half hours i though i was goign to die and the sunday i was there 6 hours.. we saw the say people both days ( well except the ones we discharged) and i learned alot. i was very tiring though.. 

on the other fronts my dad is having good days and bad. who knows what will happen .. i just hope that he relizes that I Love Him More then ANYTHING in the world..   Mom is still frusterated and stress because of the whole deal .. its alot to take care of him.(esplicially on bad days)  but we will get though it we are a tough family and life will live on

Apo well other then the normal Ryan and Andy drama i really have gotten much. We sent out the letters and we are wait on reponses. Andy told me that he made a mistake on soem of the adresses and is goign to re send them out.. o well hes human too  cant blame him for that...

"event","ok this journal is all about how i fucked up the other day. i would appriciate not rude comments about it.. 
and if there is alot of spelling mistakes im sorry i might start to cry!!

well any way on with what happened ...

Jenn S. Carlos and I were watching movies and drinking nothing to big well then i got the bright idea that i wanted to smoke and call ryan to see if he was ok and what he was up too.. ( by this time im pretty tipsy). so i call him and he doesnt answer.  so i finished my cig then jenn carlos and i started to talk and andy joind the convorsation.. i then preceeded to call ryan agian to see if he would answer there was no answer.. then i smoke another cig .. during this time carols some how stole my phone and called ryan and left a voice mai. THen jenn got the phone frome carlos  and called ryan and yes she left a voicemail..  i then called him back to appolige and the phone was turned off and i remember leaving a voice mail about a blow job.. i then ran to my room to see where ryan was. HIs away message was that he was in bed so that kinda upset me that he didnt wnat to talk to me so i left him a im that said.   ""i love how u when u are drunk want to talk to me and cuddle but when im drunk and wht to talk to u u fucking go to bed i wonder how that makes me feel .. LIKE SHIT ... thanks alot"" 
i then went back down stairs to drink more and smoke..  WE pissed around for a while. and then andy and i went up to my room and jenn and carlose went to his.. we were giveing them privocy for sex .. andy and i jsut turned on the tv and sat down and talked ..i then decied to write in ryans on line journal.. the comments that i stated in it were jsut comments that i was pulling out of my ass.i was upset at this point at carlos and jenn for leaving him voice mails and i was startign to cry so for some stupid reason when i was drunk the only journal i could think of was ryans. then i get an im that carlos is mad at jenn. so andy and i go to the breezway to find carlos. Andy Carlos and i  all talked about the situation and we calmed him down .. we then went to carlos' room and put on a movie.. we sat and watched it for about an hour then we all got hungry so we went to taco hell.. then we all passed out in my room and woke up the next morning..   


So this is how i fucked up:
  Ryan will not talk to me now and i stared to cry about it last night.. I pissed him off really bad and i have lost all that i had with him. IM extreamly upset that this happened .. and  if i could would turn back time to correct it.. I LIKE RYAN A LOT AND I DONT WANT TO LOSE HIM..  but i did ! or at least that is how i feel.. 


but i need to focus on school work if that is possable .. talk to you all later"

And all this does is make a chain of bad moods .. i think that is why this world is so fucked up.. that and we have stupid people that put there nose where it doesnt belong because they like to piss people off.. 

I also want to know how do u know who your true friends are .. how do u know if u can trust them.. see i give every one chances because i know everyone fucks up its human nature but where is the line.. people tell me that i shouldnt be friends with this person or that and others are like just let go of the issue.. who do i believe? Im just trying to cut the drama in my life which i know i cant do real well because i like some drama it makes life intersting.. 

on the Apo note .. im prez agian and i think people hate that .. Not that i really care that much. but its still something that will effect my last year as prez but i can deal with it.

On everything else in my life.. Ryan im attached even though we arent official and i care for him alot but i wonder sometimes what i should do.. 
on the school note .. ITS ALMOST OVER THANK GOD.. Im getting decient grades so far now lets see what my finals do to me.. 

I relaly dont know how to get my feelings out they are all bundled in a ball in my head and very confusing and very weird  .. but that is me.. and yes i admit i am a psyco bitch that need to get a life at times but u know thats the way i like it and im not changing .. i might put my foot in my mouth and i might piss people off but u know what if u dont want to know the answer then dont ask the question or if u dotn want to be around me then dotn ... i dotn force u too.. 
 
but i will write in this later when i can clear my head and get all my emotions out on the subject that are in my head..

Im getting closer to some friends and moving away from others which is really weird. I dont know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. All i can do is accept it . I just hope that i get closer to friends that will be there for me forever and not loose the ones that are there for me all the time.. its a hard decision at times but as i said in a previous journal entry im not perfect and i will just have to live with the decision.  

My dad got a new scooter wheelchair. Its so cool. I have a new lazy way to get around the house when hes not using it .. hehehehe im a mean person at times stealing my dads wheelchair i know..  

Andy and i are finally on terms where we both understand that the relationship is over and that friends are what we are better at.. i know people disagree with me on this issue but this is my opinion so fuck off. We have been helping each other out with the relationship that we both are trying to find/getting in to. Its nice to have friend to talk to it about that doesnt always give there opinion on everything u say, or tries to beat your story all the time..  

The frat ...... what can i say but its going to be hard if i dont get prez this next year .. i have to admit if i dont get it i might not be in because i know me and i will make peoples lives hell. and i dotn want to hurt my friends like that. i think i will feel like i did so much work but no one gives a damn and i also feel that if we dont find some one strong enough for the position the frat will go to hell.. now dont get me wrong we have some good caneidates but i think im the best ( had to toot my own horn as jenn 02 would say) but thats the frats decision. 

well the RYAN ISSUE... I dont understand him at times.. like today he was tring to write ryans property on my body but.. am i ? what is the rules of this relationship?... Am i his or can i date around? i jsut dont understand .. we arent exclusive but if i talk about another guy he get the jealous look .( which is adorble for u all to know). He keeps telling me he and his roommates feel hes getting the short end of the deal. What is the long end of deal? i dont know  AHHH it makes me CRAZY. But i know one thing im not going to worry about it to much im just going to go as the flow goes and well enjoy what have for how long i have it. its not like im marrying  him or anything .. 

OH yeah and for the people that dont know me or new me in the past. Your not in my life for a reason so stay out of it .. i dont want u in it . i dont want u around it . or to know it .. so you all need to go fuck your selves in the ass and die.. (and this is a good day for me so i can get mean ) If u have any questions on if i want u in my life ask i will tell the truth.. One person i want all the way out of my life is RYAN KERNS ... YOU ARE THE BIGGEST ASSHOLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD AND U TAKE THE OXYGEN THAT I COULD BREATH .. YOU WILL AMOUNT TO NOTHING...  AND FOR YOUR BITCH KEEP HER NOSE OUT OF MY FUCKING BUSINESS .. SHE DONT KNOW ME, SHE WONT KNOW ME AND SHE DOESNT NEED TO ...  

Now its food , shower and homework time before i go out tonight with one of my bestest girls in the world I LOVE YOU MAYA!!"

"event","So i have been depressed latly. I couldnt figure out why and now i think i have. See i feel unwanted. all my friends tell me how wonderful there day is and how they are going to do this with this person and or going to do that with that person. And im happy for them but i feel that the only thing im good for is smiling.. see all my friends make me smile and make me happy at times but i feel its only to bitch. 
(I get happy when i have peoples problems even though it pisses me off how stupid it is at times). But latly people have been saying things that really hurt but dont realize that they hurt... 

but i will get off that subject.. the new subject is Ryan (Surprize Surprize).. Well i feel that Ryan will never ask me out.. its been almost 2 months since we have been talking and everytime the subject comes up he blames andy well guess what ANDY IS NO LONGER IN THE PICTURE. Im just tired of debating the issue .. im tired of being depressed over it and im tired of worrying about it.. i just want to know if this is going anywhere other then what it is .. ITs not that im not happy with what it is but i would like to know if it will progress.. and from what it sounds it wont .. when i told him that i would be mad if 2 of my friends got together before we did .. he stated why should i ask u out i have all the stress and shit like a relationship.. no affence that hurt .. so i wish he would make up  his mind. 

well i got to go to bed because i have to get up early to go get beautiful( hair appt) talk to ya all soon"

"event","Well the last month has been intersting off and on and u have heard most of it but I cant even start to decribe it.. 

Well I dont know who my friends are and who arent any more. one minute they act like they are there for me and the next they leave and push me in the cold.. 
Some of them talk behind my back and then deny what they say.. what the fuck .. who are my friends .. do i have any other then my one friend that is there no matter what i want and what i need.. she doesnt even live on campus and shes there for me. I mean come on ppl STOP THE FUCING DRAMA.. i cant handle it.  
I mean with all the school work i have and all the other things in my life i dont need drama ..
 the guy i want to date still wont be my boyfriend because of how i act toward andy and i dotn knwo how to change. I want to but i dont know what he wants to how to even start to change. So How can i.. i mean i dotn have a lot of ppl to hang out with and when i wnat to do soemthing Andy is always there because hes like me doesnt have a life.. So i call on him..  IS that a bad thing?
 well other things in my life is that my friend laura is upset at a man that needs to get a fucking life.  He needs to stop hurting her and tell her whats going on. but im always there for her.. other then that i really havent talk to to many ppl latly .. i have been woring about ryan and if he is ok with his illness.. my dad has been acting weird to i have been worring about him and everything just feels like its going to shit. I really havent slept much and im past tired but i and so tired that im not tired.. when i do fall asleep i have been having nightmares and i wake up..  so im a little bitchy at times .. i have been arguing with everyone latly  and im sorry for that.. im just under alot of stress and im trying not to take it out on ppl and im doing my best... 
i found out that im the worst president in the world to my frat and im about just to give up trying on anything and i just want to scream but i cant .. but o well i will live and i will move on .. 

on a happy note its almost easter break and i get to spend time with my family and see all of them.. and just to let everyone know that is intersted ... Ryan makes everything better when im with him.. i feel like my world has turned upside down i try not to think aobut my problems i do but not as much.. so thats good .. If things work out between us but im never sure of that.. but i have learned just take one day at a time... babysteps work

"event","Well today was an intersting day.. i mean it doesnt seam like it would be all i did was go to classes and work. went out to eat with friends and talked to ryan the basic things i do everyday but it was different.. 

See i was thinking about things that i never think about.. Like who I am and what i truly want. And i realized that i really dont know..  See i put a face over me and make people think that i know what i want to do and how i want to do it but really im so confuses that i should be in a mental institution. 

For example.. i was thinking  of the Ryan situation.. Yes i do want to date him and Yes i am getting attached.. And Yes if it doesnt work out i will be upset. But i realized even if it doesnt i have a friend that i can depend on.. I thought about what i could change to change the situation to make him happier with me and realized its not all me. i admitt i havnt made his life real easy. and i admit i problay should think about his feelings toward Andy but i also realized i dont really tell him how i feel about everything... But im Human and i can do everything right or  i would be perfect. That would be nice im not perfect and im glad. 

on another note on ryan .. i feel really bad that i got him sick and now i have to pay for it.. i dont get to spend a weekend away from cap with him. he has to stay home and get better .. which is good but it makes me sad but i will live i will just have to see him sunday ..

well i have been alittle stressed latly  i have 2 tests on monday and im not looking foward to i have to get at least a 70 % on my math test or i cant come back to cap and i really want to come back to cap.. and my micro test is just going to be a bitch.
 on top of that i have been puting pressure on my self to figure out what grad schools i want to apply to becuase i have to start applying her in about a year and i havent really even started to look at the info that they are sending me..  i dont even know if i want to go to grad school any more.. after this month i dont think i want to go.. 

on the friends note im still really upset that my best friend is getting married on sat and im not invited. it just hurts. i know i just need to move on but its easier said then done.. i still wish her the best in life and love..  

im very emotional at this time too and i want this shit to stop. i want to get my feelings undercontrol  and stop being a cyco bitch.  

Ok im confused and i dont know how to deal with it.Let me explain....
Im one of those ppl that are very needy.. i dont mean to be but when u are in my life i need you.. i get really depressed when im alone and i start to cry because i feel im the only one that cares even though i know thats not true . well im trying to stop that habbit by staying alone in my room for hours but all that does is make be depressed and want to leave this world and never come back .. but i really dont mean i .. i know i just need to go to a councler about it but this is a childhood thing that will take time to correct..
 see as a child i was made fun of and now that i have friends that truly care i dotn wnat to lose them. so i try to shower them with material things and try to spend all my time with them to make them feel important but its makeing me feel important. I dont feel that my friends really want to spend time with me .. like i get on there nerves but no one tells me this.. its just a feeling. So i admitt when my friends spend time with others i get jealous and i feel unimportant and replaced and latly this has gotten worse.. I cant stop thinking of leaving this world and how no one would notice that i was gone.. i mean my childhood friends dont ever call me any more except when they are board or want something.. my friends at cap are around till some one else is around then they leave me.. i wish i  didnt feel this way .. i want to be normal .. i want to feel loved or cared about by ppl when they arent around.  

sorry to end on a depressiing note but i think you know what im doing (crying)
love ya

"event","So life has been up and down for the last couple of days.. But i also have been sick so that might have soemthing to do with it.. 

This weekend was good .. i spent almost all my time with ryan got to know him a little better and just chilled .. figured i better not do anything to strenous. I also got to see mommy and daddy on saturday. They missed me. I got a new cell phone and ever thing was goin good then last night things went to SHIT!!!

i check my email like i always do and i find out that my math teacher is a Fucking loser and is going to fail me becuase i have been fucking sick. so i start balling my eyes out because if i fail this class i cant come back to cap. and if i dont come back to cap  i will just drop out.. i know it doesnt seam sence able but you know what im not sencable..  so i call mom crying .. i call andy crying.. i call ryan crying.. pretty much all of them say you shouldnt drop out pay more money.. well then andy of course put in more 2 sence then that in but we wont go there.. 

so any way then i get anther email this moring from my math teacher and he appologizes for his actions and understand that i have been sick. HE also states that he believes that i can pass the class.. 

So whats up with this shit one minute he hates me the next he loves me i dont understand.. am i passing or failing .. am i going to be here or not.. i dont know.. all i know is im going to try my best .. which doesnt always work but its all i can do. 

on the social front.
 I hear form some ppl that ALPHA PHI OMEGA MEMBERS dotn think that me and andy are over.. WE ARE GET OVER IT.. im tired of fuckign with this shit .. im sorry that andy is my best friend and you people have nothig better to do with your lives but meddle in mine but im telling u i dont have feeling for andy and he doesnt for me.. i didnt know i couldnt joke with a friend and i didnt know that i couldnt talk to a friend because IF i do i must be dating them.. IM NOT A WHORE PPL.I do jsut ahve friends.. 
But any way away from that ranting and raving.. 

If i seam bitchy or emotional its because i am.. its PMS week Yeah... and i havnet smoke in 8 days .. i might just quit but i doubt it.  

I decided next year im geting a double singe to my self agian and ppl can come visit me i think i  will live in shaaf i have lived here for 3 years why not a 4th.. 
 but any way im going to be late to class if i dotn stop typing .. i will talk to ya all soon and if u need me im here pulling my hair out on life dicisions

Im almost done with this semester and i cant wait to get it over .. i got summeritis i think.. O well i will get through the last month HOPEFULLY. I have to take classes this summer too so that will suck Balls . but i get to graduate in 3 semesters and im out of this hell hole they call CAPITAL!!! 

oh about my illness. im starting to get better but slowly. i found out the other day the first meds they gave me i was allergic too. Great the dr tried to kill me! well not really it just made me vomit but still that sucked. so i had to go to urgent care to get new meds. I like the anti nausea meds . They make me SLEEP!!

Well on the other front Andy finally relized that he is in the same position as me. Ryan and him dont get along .. Heather and I dont get along .. Funny how things come back at u isnt it. Thats a lessen learned dont put your foot in your mouth.

Any way on the Ryan front .. 
I dont know whats going on.. I mean i can tell hes intersted. But i dotn think he wants a serious relationship which is fine he just has to tell me .. Im not trying to push him in to one i understand that we both will be graduating soon. And we both have real buzy lives. but im still not saying that i wouldnt like a serious relationship with him either. we will see what happens.

MY Friends .. 
I like to at times say what friends.. But i know i have them. Jenn ""luna"" is the greatest shes there for me through think and thin like a friend is supose to be.
 Russell and the gang really dont talk to me any more.. i dotn know why they just dotn.. well we will see where that goes.. 
Andy thats a story with in its self.. i never know about him it depends on him mood if he wants to be around. more like it if if his bitch of a girlfriend is around. I mean if shes around no one can talk to him that a sin in his book.but when she not around we usually get along .. yes there are still the normal arguements that we have always gotten in to that im so use to i could yell with my eyes closed and still know where he is standing at..
 Katie I love her to death. I hope every thing works out for her .. she has had some rough times this year and im always there for her.  

MY Family.. 
They are great. My mom is the best she is always there for me when i need little things. .Like when i need her spegettii sauce and need it buy wednesday. MY dad is doing good .. He as bad as ever.. Just does things to get on moms nerves its funny. 

Life in general...
its been a rough couple of weeks but im getting through it .. i have noticed if u just say fuck it then there are no worries but that can get u in trouble. So i say simi fuck it. i mean i need to learn to priortize and i havent i will tell the truth i think shopping is more important then classes. (THATS BAD DOTN START THAT)..  I had a scare the other night with sucide and its over now i think im good for a while .. i promise i wont leave all you hansome Men out there .. hehehe

Ryan came to visit .. i got him alcohol that his roommates asked for. 

I then went out with sarah stollenwerk since i havent been out of my cell(room) all day. when i got back jenn came up and showed me her hair.. boring day i know.
 and now i need to watch a video that i really dont want to watch because im not in the mood to hear about transplants.

well i have issues that i cant tell ya yet let me figure them out alittle more then i can put them in to words so if i seem distant to some ppl there problay is a reason and i just cant talk about it yet. well sorry this is boring

I dont know if i should blame that on the alcohol or that i was tired at hell.  well what i did today. well i had to be a a scouting dinner at 4 so i took a shower and left. while in between dancing naked agian.  after the diner i had to run to the frat meeting which was pushed back a half an hour so excet board  and during the excet board meeting there was some feeling of going to kill some one. that some one was Brandon. he thinks that he knows it all . well guess what im going to make his life  miserable  and that is what he deserved.. hes acting like like god and he isnt and i will do what the fuck i wnat to on retreat.
well on a happier note. Me and the guy i like spent some time together tonight and it was nice we just talked and had fun.I wanted him to stay but he wouldnt becuse hes afraid of andy my ex walking in the room and my bed breaking. one day eh will stay. at least he says he will.

"event","Well last night was interesting. I downloaded music to my computer as i danced naked around my room.. Well i wasnt always completely naked. I really think i should be a striper,but that is another issue. After awhile my friend came up and we talked about stuff that is going on in our lives.

After that i talk to the guy i like and we were going to go out, then we werent then i just ended up going to his place and chilling with some of his roommates and friends which was amusing.
 
WE went to bed around 1:30 and i was sleeping very nicely. Then at 6 AM Ryan got the Notion to WAKE MY ASS UP! hes lucky i didnt kill him hehehehe jk. we made out and talked for about an hour then we went back to sleep YEAH SLEEP.

OH yeah lesson learned dont talk about anything when trying to do stuff with a guy his penis might need therapy after that. hehehe but half of the world needs therapy its the 21st century. haha

I woke up about 11:30 today and left his place around 1. when i got back to cap i went out to eat with some friends. we left here around 2 and yeah didnt get back till 5pm . That is some crapy service.

Tonight im celebrating my friends 21st b-day . Since she doesnt drink there will be no alcohol. o well i dont need it.

Whats Confusing me
LIFE!!!!!

I just wish there was a way i new what was going on . Where i will end up? who i will end up with? where i will go after capital? the basics! but this has been on my mind more now then ever. and its because i will be graduate in a year and a half.  i have been looking at grad schools and with doing that and with the guy i like its has re brought up these issues. I just wish i knew what to do. 

I have been wondering about  me and the guy .. i just wish i knew if i should just stick this thing out with him or move on .. I REALLY LIKE HIM and he says he likes me but he has issues. well i wonder if that will ever be resolved . i have been talking to him a month now and they are not yet resolved and i dont blame him for that. i told him to take his time and i want him to but i also just want the answer. well i guess one day i will get it. I HOPE HEHEHEHEHE. 
 
Family... Mom is still buggin me about my toungue ring. ok i have had it for 2 years now let it rest. but she has to give me speeches and shit. its a pain in my butt.  My dad is ok hes still sick but he will always be that way which hurts a lot. I just hope hes can walk me/wheel me down the aisle one day. we will see though. 
well i better get off here or i will never stop typing with all the thoughts going through my head 
 talk to ya later"

"event","Well of course for all of u that read the journal last night realized i was pissed a some what drunk.. That was a bad combination. 
well i decided to call the guy i like and bitch him out .. that is never good. Then i proceeded to cry because i called him and thought he would never talk to me again.Well that point was proven wrong because we did talk more. and i think us both being drunk didnt help the situation. But i did find out some feelings that will help me understand more about the relationship with him and i will work on trying to correct that. to a certain extent. im not going to change who i am for him but i can change some of the things he would like me to but doesnt want to say it. 
one of his complains was that he felt inadequate in my life because we dont spend a lot of time together. well i try to spend time with him i visit him at work i go to his apartment.i dont know what else to do. should i tie my self to him so he can drag me around all day.. he says that my friends are very demanding of my time but i dont think they are .. i really dont spend that much time with them except when im bord and feel like procrastinating. so i dont think he knows what hes talking about and just making excuses so he doesnt have to come to me and i have to come to him.. well thats fine but if im always comming to him he will see me just as much as he does now i dont have time to go there all the time. but we will see what happens .
when it comes to the school thing i was talking about i think im getting another chance to make things right. Which is a relief.  my teacher is giving a make up exam in my math class so  i can hopfully get that grade up.  
with everything else im broke till i can get to the bank but i dont know when that will be.. and lifes starting to turn around.

"event","Hey everyone,

THings going on in my life. Well right now it is hard. School, boyz, family and other things are distracting me from being me.. 
The main thing that is distracting me is this guy i like. I know that he likes me but he doesn't know if he wants to be my exclusive boyfriend because im friends with my ex boyfriend. See me and my ex dated for a little over a year and have been broken up for about 2 months and he is still im my life. he is my best friend but he is jealous of the new guy. Which is understandable. He said he loved me and it hurts him. So the new guy is a little weirded out by this because hes afraid that the ex will try to get me back . but i try to tell him that he wont get me back we are better friends.
 on top of that some of my other friends are trying to meddle in this relationship and i dont know how to handle it ..  Im all confused. I  like this guy so much but i also dont wnat to wait 3-4 months for him to ask me out .. he says it wont take that long but its been a month now and i dotn wnat to wait any more im tired of waiting i just want to know so i dont get to attached to him. 
on top of that my grades are on a frenzy one minute they are good the next they suck.. i just want to be smart have a wonderful boyfriend and have a normal life. But what is normal. to me that is chaos. well i better go i have to go out with a friend and her fiance tonight that will be fun can i say 3rd wheel.. o well  i will update this soon .. love ya all"

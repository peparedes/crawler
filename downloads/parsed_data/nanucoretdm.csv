It makes absolutely no sense to me why we always want what we can't have. I hate these feelings that have been following me around for a month and a half now. I just want to put it to rest. I just want to find someone to make things okay, but the one I want to find won't let me, and nobody else would either for that matter.

"event","So I saw RENT. I had high expectations, because everyone said it was great, but I didn't think it would come anywhere near the play. I was wrong. The movie followed to play perfectly, was perfectly acted and sung, and had mostly the original cast from 1997. Rosario Dawson was absolutely amazing. I fell in love with her as Mimi. I fall in love with Mimi every time I see it. I'm the kind of guy who always falls for the Mimi. I love the feeling you get after art touches you. I want to touch people with art. I want to make people feel the way I felt after I saw RENT for the first time on Broadway, or after I saw it tonight. The one thing I take away from something like this is that life is a truly beautiful thing. Love it."

"event","Its so good to be home for good right now. This summer, being away so much made me realize how much I dig my friends, and even my crappy one horse town. So heres my summer rundown for 2005...

1)I spent the past 2 months of my life wishing with all my being that I could be with some one who was 200 miles away. It really gave me an appreciation of what I have, and this year its only going to get better.

2)I got some news a few days ago that was really upsetting to me. One of my ""dreams"" or hopes for the future was sort of shit on. I was really upset for two days, and then I sort of got over it. I just need to remember to do my best and I'll eventually get my reward. The best is yet to come.

3)This year I'm determined to do as good as I did last year in school, or even better. My grades have become really important to me, and im starting to look at schools like Harvard and Columbia, and I need to stay sharp accademcally.

4)Today I'm having my first band practice in over a month and a half...rock on.

5)I want to be an actor. 

6)The greatest obstacle to our dreams is ourselves. I need to remember not to be the road block to my own success.

7)Explo was an amazing experience that I'll never forget, but I wouldn't want to do it again.

8)I want to start an improv. comedy club this year at Nanuet. Any suggestions of what teacher I should ask to be advisor?

9)Great summer overall. I'm looking foward to school though. I have a feeling this is going to be the best year yet.

All these retarted amature no talent wanna be poets sent in their crap and we had to put it in because nobody with any talent wants to submit anything after what happened last year. I still like my poem that is going to be in it. Its kind of ironic in a way, its called ""Please Censor This Poem"" and its short, but I'm proud of it anyway. I just don't want to waste my night fucking reading it to people who don't care and then listening to some really bad crap. Whatever, I'll live.

The senior awards were today. Wow. I was seriously this close to gouging my eyes out with a spoon. I almost threw up multiple times. It was gross.

Its really setting in that a lot of the seniors are leaving. There are a lot who I'm really going to miss, Rachel, Danielle and Rob and Carl but there were two people this year who really had an impact on me. They probably don't read my live journal, but I just really am going to miss Ben and Pete. From my first day Pete made me feel welcome, and like I wasn't just Rachel's brother and I'll never forget him for that. Ben has always been some one that I admire in many asspects of life and I'll miss seeing him in the shows and working alongside him. 

Its time for me to go.

"event","This weekend was extremely amazing, so I just think I might tell you about it.

Friday Prem came over and we watched American History X. This is the craziest movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Edward Norton is an amazing actor, and all the insane imagery in this movie really had an effect on me. Usually movies like this are just fucked and crazy, nihilistic, kind of like fight club. The fact that this one encompassed all of those aspects but still managed to achieve a higher purpose, and a moral, is just cool. It was great watching it with Prem to, because she always has something interesting to say about movies after they are over.

Saturday. O my god, this is quite possibly the best day of my life. I got up early and picked up Timmy and went over to 7's house to record. We put all our shit on the back porch and came in and his dad tells us to clear out all the furniture in the dining room and half the living room. So we cleared it out and now we had our live space. So then Chris showed up and we went upstairs and brought the drumset down. We set up the drums, and positioned all our amps in other rooms and then the micing began. He had 4 mics on the drums, a mic on the bass amp and both guitar amps, and then the kicker, the vocal tube condensor mic for my vox. So he moved the condensor into the other room around the wall from all the amps and the drums. We played through the first song and it was pretty bad, but we just came over and listened to the playback. It started playing and we all sort of looked at eachother and made an expression that said ""Holy shit that sounds amazing"". So we played through all the songs a bunch of times 'til we got some good takes. We decided that because of overlap with the vocal mic that I am going to come back and sing through all the songs sometime this week and get a good vocal track for all our instrumentals. I'm so pumped for this. I can't wait until it comes out. We are going to try to get a cd release show for it. Its going to sound amazing.

So I came home from recording, and then I remembered that I was going to see Star Wars. So I called Prem, and we went out. We got to the theatre like, I donno, 45 minutes early and we had pre bought our tickets, but the place was still packed. We sat in the front row, so we were sort of looking up the whole time, but it was such an amazing movie. I thought it was the best one of the 6 episodes. It was like, the best movie I've seen in a while. Good plot, awesome action, the only thing was there were more then a few very cheesy lines. Its okay though, because the movie was so amazing.

Thats all for now. Everyone buy my bands demo when it comes out. Allright, I'll be going now. peace.

"event","Yesterday was a crazy day. First of all, I had NYSSMA. I woke up early and went down to sing. I did extremely well, just a few mistakes that I could have easily fixed. I got a 97. The judge was super cool, and he said I was the most naturally gifted singer he had heard all day, and that I needed to get a private teacher and hone my skills because he thinks I can really go somewhere with my natural talent. That was nice to hear. Then came trombone. My judge was a huge bitch, and she was really not that nice to me. I played really badly compared to how I was playing it earlier that day, however, I played it remarkably well considering how I basically learned it in 4 days. I got a 94. O well, you win some you lose some.

Then came the show. About 20 people from our school as well as some from the Middle School showed up to see us play. It was a mess, because our set time kept getting pushed back until it turned out that we ended up playing 45 minutes after the show was schedueled to end. Almost all our kids stayed to see us. We didn't play amazingly, but we had a lot of equipment and sound problems. Despite that, me and 7 were tight, and every one put on an AMAZING stage show. Everyone liked us, and that was good to hear, because it shows that even though we didnt play them great, we still wrote solid songs. For any one who came out to see us, and stayed despite all the horrible schedueling, thank you so much.

"event","Its been a while since I updated. I really have nothing much to say. Last night me and Prem watched Garden State. It was a lot of fun and we both really liked it. Today she baked cookies for my band and came to our practice. She said she liked us, but I think she is lying. She said she wouldn't tell us if we sucked anyway. I guess its better that way.

7's dad stopped by and listened to a couple of songs and talked to us about recording. I realized I could learn a lot from him, so I am going to really use this oppurtunity. We should hopefully get at least 3 songs done. He said it will be a live recording, because if he records us in the studio it will be hell. I guess that is a nice way of saying we aren't good enough yet. O well...

So next weekend is the show, and then the weekend after that we record. Then we start writing again and get more shows. I can't believe I finally have what I have been working for for so long. Its surreal, and somehow bittersweet. I don't think we are ready to play this show. I told the guys that a few weeks ago and they all said ""I don't care we are playing anyway"". Well now that its only a week away, the general concensus was that we are not ready at all. We will play, and we will sound good. We have talent, and we have good songs, and we will be fine. I just wished he had taken time to make ourselves that much better before we came out. We will play 8 songs. We probably won't fill our set time of 30 mins with that, probably not even close. But we all decided its better to play 8 songs and have people be impressed then play 10 and have people say you suck. I can't wait to start writing again because I know how good I am beginning to write, and I know that Tim and 7 are just hitting their stride also. I hope any one who reads this will do us a favor and come check us out. We will really appreciate seeing anybody we know at the show. We are a fun band, and anyone who likes punk, metal, or upbeat rock that you can move around and sing a long to will have a good time. I promise.


The show is in the basement of Good Sheppard Church on North Main Street in Pearl River on May 14th from 4pm-10pm. Do yourself a favor and don't show up at 4, you will be bored. It is an $8 suggested donation last time I checked, and all the proceeds go to the victims of the Tsunami, so I hope if you can spare the cash you will. My band is called The Space Monkey Mafia. Come check it out, it will be fun, I promise.

My house is like a fucking warzone lately and I hate it. Every one needs to just lighten up and leave every one else alone. Whatever. 


I think I need to try to try and have more multidimensional views on things. I don't think I am closed minded, because I'm not. I'm very open to almost anything. I don't even think its that I can't see all sides of an issue, because I can, and I usually do. I think the problem is that I'm to quick to disregard the other side. O well, I guess its something to work on...

I hung out with Prem's friends for the first time last night. It was good times. They are all really nice kids. I felt a little out of place, but not awkward, just like, I didn't fit there, but that comes with time. They were all cool people, and I had a good time. We watched Shaun of the Dead. Funny stuff...

Positives of running in blind: 1) Everything is new and exciting.
2) You get to learn a lot about yourself.
3) You become positively influenced to exand upon your definition of ""normal"".
4) You can be as happy as you've ever been.

Negatives of running in blind: 1) You are constantly wondering if you are everything that you were expected to be in the situation.

So if the positives out weigh the negatives, then why am I do insecure right now?"

I'm also sick, and it sucks, because I have avoided getting really sick all year and of course when Spring comes it happens.

There are good times and there are bad times. I know its for real now. I know there's no one that can help me on this, and that I just have to get strong and help myself. I'm so glad that she understands, and she is there for me all the time. I feel like I'm dumping my shit on her, she says she would rather that then if I wasn't completely open with her. The thing is, I don't know whats wrong. I feel like I could say a thousand things, but none of them come out when I open my mouth. I'm just glad I have some body there for me...


For the first time in 3 months I feel like a good situation has gone horribly fucking wrong. Every one is trying to adjust and choose their role and assimilate into the ""group"" dynamic, but in the process we are all running eachother over. Every one is either distancing themselves, trying to take control, getting worked up, or run over, or burned out. Its just bad.

It was such a great show because it was completely based in modern reality and thats a rarity amongst most broadway shows nowadays. I really loved it.

In other news, nothing that out of the ordinary is going on. I'm really enjoying where I'm at right now. I'm having a great time with life, and I think thats a cool deal. Unrelated but equally important, Bowie is fucking god. I love glam rock so damn much its not even funny, and Bowie is just the master of his domain. My favorite glam band is still probably The New York Dolls, but Bowie and Bolan have to be two of the most ingenious song writers of all time, and I dig both of them right now.

I never dreamed that out of all the chaos surrounding everything over the past few days that something this beautiful could emerge. I'm going to try to do how I feel justice right now...

First of all, ""Anything Goes"" was an amazing sucess. Everyone involved should be extremely proud of themselves, because I know I am. We all came together like I never thought was possible and we put on the best show I have ever had the honor of being part of.

Second of all, I have an extreme sense of pride right now. A person I completely respect and admire more than almost any one else I know gave me a great honor last night and the feeling is still sinking in. I couldn't have predicted that by the end of this year, I would be accepted by this person and everyone else here with open arms, and I never would have dreamed that I would be ""carrying the torch"" of nanuet theatre, but the fact that these people have taken me in and become my friends really means a lot to me. Thank you all.

Finally, I just want to say one other thing. Right now I have an oppurtunity in front of me to have what I have wanted for a very long time. Its a strange feeling, and even though no one thinks it will work, I know it will. Something about her makes me smile, and I just wanted to say right here (because I have nowhere better to say it) that she is anything I could have asked for and more. Thats all for now.

"event","Last night can not be described in mere words. If I had died I would have died the most content person in the world. Danielle sang like a glamourous, sexy, amazing Reno and she fucking lit the place up and then burned it to the ground. I have never seen anything, nor will I ever see anything as moving as that performance that Danielle gave on the Nanuet stage. In the face of adversity, restricted time, and the unbelievable stress she was probably under, she triumphed and she came out as a class act. I think its ironic how after four years, she gets the last laugh, and she comes out on top. Thats justice, and thats the way its supposed to be.

As for the rest of the cast, I saw something else that was awe inspiring last night. I saw 40-something people unite in the face of adversity and go on with the show, and put that poetry to motion and bring it all to life. It was a great testament to the power that theatre and art have over the lives of all those involved. United we stood, and I will never forget last night's show as long as I live.

To some people, theatre is a hobby, to some, its a social experience, and to others its a complete life style. Its only when all three of those aspects come together that the show, the art, the poetry, jumps off the page and comes to life. Somehow, we all captured that last night, and I think that's something to be proud of.

The final reason why last night was so amazing...""love on the rocks, cardiac shock""

"event","I don't get it sometimes. You can spend 6 months in seclusion and think you have yourself all figured out. You can sit at home and write, and read, and think and learn about yourself, why you did the things you did, why you do the things you do, and why you live the way you live. And then when you finally get the chance to snap out of it, and get out there, and have fun, and live your life, everything you thought goes out the window. So maybe I'm not a good person. Maybe I said some things I shouldn't have said. Maybe I hurt some people I dearly regret hurting, and maybe theres nothing I can do about it. ""What goes around comes around, and I can't wait til you get yours"". Thats what someone said to me. The thing that baffles me is, its true, and I have gotten mine. I've gotten it over and over and I know exactly what it feels like. And although I didn't have much choice, I still did it to them. What does that make me? A bad person? Maybe. A normal kid who makes mistakes? Maybe that also. All I know is that I feel like shit. I just want to live my life, and stop being such an uptight person. So as a new friend said to me last night, ""thats what highschool is all about"". I actually agree with that, and so starting right now, I'm going to work towards it. I am not changing the way i think, or my morals, or my beliefs, just the way I apply them to the way I live my life. I hope it works out.

"event","I went to see Wicked with my family the other day. It was the first time I had seen it, since I didn't go on the school trip, but I knew all the songs because my sister played the soundtrack in her car for 3 months after she saw it the first time. It was amazing. I think its the best show I've ever seen, and I've seen some amazing shows. Les Mis is still at the top of my list, but the show was just unbelievable. Its ingenious way of interweaving a good message, and amazing music all into a story that already exists was an amazing accomplishment for the writer. The songs were some of the best I've ever heard especially ""Defying Gravity"". Plus, Shoshana Bean is awesome.

I've been thinking about what I want to do with my life lately. I know I'm going to go to a good college, and get a good eductaion, in what I have no idea, but I just don't see myself falling into a profession that I can be prepared for through college. I used to think people who said ""I want to be an actor"" or ""I want to be a rock star"" were just pathetic and wasting their time. But when I think about what I have a passion for, its acting, or writing and performing my own songs. So is that just as bad as the dumbass who thinks he is going to be a professional athelete? I guess you could argue that it is or that it isn't. All I know is that one day, people will know my name, and I don't know why, but I know they will.

"event","Practice was awesome. I mean, overall, it was just okay, but the level of confidence it gave me in my band was awesome. We spent an hour and a half trying to get a song together and I had exhausted every way in my head that I could explain it and I just thought we were shit out of luck. So with 15 mins. left in the practice, we just decide to jam, and Timmy starts playing the song, but a little different, and 7 comes in and he's playing along, and then all the sudden we are all playing the song. And so we played it through 2 more times, wrote and intro, and finished it, all in 10 minutes. It gave me this feeling of unbelievable accomplishment, and it made me realize that you cant make music, music happens all on its own. You can write a song down on paper but until you play it in a band with your 3 other guys, and you experience that bond and that feeling it gives you, its not music, its just a song. But songs don't move people, music does. Viva Le Rock N Roll.

"event","This is going to be a very random update so in order to avoid confusion, I have divided it into segments lettered A-F. Stay with me here...

a)This week sucked 

b)Chris is mega grounded, like, indefinatly. He has given me and Tim to keep on with the band without him for the time being. This really sucks, because in the band's earliest and most important stages we'll be down a guitarist, a song writer, and a friend. I can't wait for him to come back, but until he does, we are a three piece, yippee.

c)Tommorow we are practicing. I have to drive 7 there but I'm not sure I have good directions to his house. O well, I'll find it

d) Play rehearsal was awesome. I love Nanuet Theatre.

e)Yesterday I was walking to English and there was this loud crash behind me and it scared the shit out of me. So I look back and there is a girl (who shall remain nameless) sitting there on the floor, flat on her ass, with a look of absolute agony on her face. And the thought that first occurs to me is that she obviously didn't trip, because its almost impossible to trip and land on your ass like that (turns out she has a bad knee and it gave out). So I am looking around, and nobody is helping this chick up, and somebody has to do it. So I turn around and I bent down and picked her up. Then people started swarming around and asking questions, so I split, because I hate when things are hectic like that. So I really didn't think much of it and I kind of forgot about it, and then today in school about 4 different people came up to me and said ""I saw you help that girl up, it was really cool"" and it made me feel really good about myself. Like, maybe I'm not such a horrible person afterall. I still don't think its that big a deal, I mean, somebody falls, you help them up, right? But whatever. Its all good...

f)I like this girl. But I don't really know if my head is on straight. I think she likes somebody else, but I don't know who, and I don't really know anybody she knows. She just kind of indicated it. The main point is, why do I always place so much hope in things that turn out to be completely hopeless?

"event","Today is an amazing day for me. First off, I'm sick, and that sucks, but I've never been simultaneously so sick and happy. To begin with, it was 53 degrees today. That is really fucking warm, and I love warm weather. After this revelation was made, I went to Tim's house to practice and meet 7. Within two hours of practice, we had an entire song, nailed down, all the way through, completely tight and solid. 7 is easily the best listener of an drummer I've ever played with and he contributed a lot to the song writing process which is a complete rarity among drummers. For the first time in my life, in a full electric band setting, the song sounded exactly the same in my head as it did in reality. It was an amazing practice. Then I came home, and slept, and rested my voice. Then I came online and found that my purevolume site is up. I played the songs for my family and I got an awesome reaction. I'm really proud of the songs, and despite the fact that at times the vox are flat, or the drums aren't exactly on time with the guitars, or the mix isn't perfect, the fact remains that these are really well written songs. Everybody check them all out and let me know what you think. www.purevolume.com/asixthstringcatastrophe      Comment and tell me what you think...Jon"

Then I came home and crashed for a bunch of hours. I called Chris a couple of times but he wasn't around, I think he is with Julie and Alannah. Then I made a pure volume site for A Sixth String Catastrophe. Thats how I spent the majority of my night. Its not up yet but it should be soon. The demos are bad, the quality is decent but sometimes my vox go flat and the mix wasn't all that good. But hey, I'm not a pro. We are going to finish writing and then bring in a couple of producers. We have studio time lined up, and we are basically getting it for free. And nothing beats free. Bill imed me and he wanted to hang out, but his parents didn't want him going out. Would have been cool, because I haven't been out all weekend. Tommorow I'm going to nyack to check out John Connor and Burbis, two bands I've wanted to see for a while.

I failed math. I'm pretty sure I did really good on all the others. But whatever, this is my one weekend of complete and utter freedom. I have absolutely NO obligations to anything and I am going to do whatever I want whenever I want. And do you know why? Because I want to.

Now that that is out of my system. Tonight is Daly's at the backdoor. I'm psyched. I understand there is going to be an acoustic comedian there also, and I fucking love shit like that. Trish is sick, and she couldn't go, and I am going to cry now. I feel bad, being sick is no fun. Chris might come or might not, and I haven't called Tim yet. So currently I'm flying solo but I'm sure I'll find somebody to go with. I really want to Rock N'Roll tonight because I am having withdrawls.

I'm looking foward to the first time since the summer where I can relax and take comfort in the fact that I have absolutely no deadlines to meet for the time being. Nothing to do but sit around and play guitar. Life is good..."

On the reading of a xanga post from someone I care a lot about, I'm in the mood to just rent movies and watch them all weekend. I just wish I had someone to watch them with. Of course, I have to save it for next weekend, cus I'm going to be fucking studying all weekend. Its okay, I'll just lock myself in my room with my guitar, my books, ""American Idiot"" and some Dr. Pepper. Mmmmm. I gotta fill out my forms for the Explo Program this summer. I asked Miss Tiffany to write me a recomendation today and she seemed excited. I think I'm going to be taking the folling courses: Improvisational Comedy and Rock N'Roll History/Song Composition. And for my three mini-courses: Acting and Directing, Race Relations In America/Current Events, and Ultimate Frisbee. Thats pretty tentative, but I'm pretty sure thats what it will be.

"event","I recently saw ""Lost In Translation"". It is the new love of my life. I don't know if it was because of past experiences, or because of the realism, or because Scarlett Johansson is the best thing to happen to cinema in a long time, but for some reason I though it was one of the greates movies I've ever seen. It also reafirmed my love for Bill Murray. I still haven't seen Eternal Sunshine, Garden State, and Closer, but I'm sure I'll get around to seeing all of them.

I've been in a weird mood lately and I'm majorly stressed out. I need to regain bearings, but hopefull after mid-terms I can find some room to breathe again. I think that American Idiot is one of the best albums I've ever heard. I listened to it, and I was just thinking ""I know all these people"". It had a lot to do with the paths that we choose, our cultures rebels and saints, and how we live our lives. ""Wake Me Up When September Ends"" is on my favorite songs list. I think I'm going to post it, comment with your list of top ten favorite songs. Peace.

In No Particular Order:
The Beatles- ""Let It Be""
Queen- ""Somebody To Love""
Green Day- ""Wake Me Up When September Ends""
River City Rebels- ""Small Town Pride""
Jackson Browne- ""The Load Out/Stay""
Lynard Skynard- ""Call Me The Breeze""
Billy Joel- ""Summer Highland Falls""
Bruce Springsteen- ""Spirits In The Night""
Don McLean- ""American Pie""
Creedence Clearwater Revival- ""Fortunate Son"""

"event","The casting for the play was pretty crazy, but I really think it will be a great show. I really wanted Sir Evelyn Oakleigh, but Ben got it, and he will play it better and funnier then I ever could. Purely based on audition, Bill earned his part and I'm sure he will also be hillarious. I'm also looking foward to Jon Roth's performance because he usually plays unidimensional characters and this will be a challenge for him. If he can rise to it, I know I will be blown away. I know Rachel will be hillarious as Bonnie, and I'm glad she gets to show off her character acting skills for once. I'm really happy for Gina on getting Reno, and I'm sure she'll do great also...

As for my part, I'm not completely thrilled. Bishop Dodson is a great part to get, especially as a freshman, but I'm just not used to being a straight man. I'm sure it will be a great time and I'm looking foward to having a lot of fun with this show. I'm also looking foward to hearing Ben say that he ""has the hot pants"" for Bill. I know this will be one of my favorite shows that I will do in highschool, and I can't wait to get started.

Side Note:  List of roles I want to play at some point before I die...
Joseph in ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat""
Male Lead (I forget his name) in ""The Music Man""
Sir Evelyn Oakleigh in ""Anything Goes""
Enjolras in ""Les Miserables""
Conrad Birdie in ""Bye Bye Birdie""

"event","Today my sister got a christmas card from the admissions office at Georgetown. The woman who wrote it congratulated her and mentioned that her essay about the establishment of the Safe club was a big factor in her acceptance to the university. It really got me thinking...

I started off thinking about what the hell I could ever write about in one of those essays. I soon realized I have 4 years to come up with it, and until I've lived out my highschool experience I wouldn't know. That's fine with me, because thinking about it would drive me insane and I don't want to be counter productive. But I was just thinking about what my legacy, or my purpose is going to be over the next four years. Sure, I'm devoted to music, and to theatre, and I'm in some good clubs, but all that is kind of a facade. I want to know what I will do that actaully affects people. Four years goes by fast, and its easy to waste them, and a lot of people do. I'm afraid if I waste these four, the next four won't be everything I hoped they would be. And so heres the question...

Who the fuck am I? Does anybody know? I'm just wondering, because I don't, and if I ever did, I guess I lost track. I don't know what I stand for. I don't think I really stand for anything, because I basically hate everything. When everyone is completely full of bullshit, there is nothing to stand for and nobody to trust. I hate political activists on both sides, they are both full of shit. I hate idealists. I hate realists. I hate democrats, I had republicans. I hate people who are so ethralled in one issue in society that they completely lose sight of other issues, and they view their issue with such a biased view that it makes them a closed minded, self righteous prick. I hate racism, I hate reverse racism. I hate gay rights activism, I hate people who don't want to give gay people equal rights. I hate war, but I also hate these fucking terrorists using our planes and our people as incriments of destruction in their god damned holy wars, and I'm not sure if they can be stopped without going to war. I hate religion, but atheists piss me off too. I hate people that cant make up their fucking minds, but I'm so damn conflicted that I guess that means I hate myself.

Well, that kind of sucks, because people who hate everything really piss me off..."

I can't wait for the musical to start. Anyway, last night was fun. We just went to the Diner, Tower, and Barnes and Noble, and then we went back to Rob and Julie's house. It was a great time...

I've been thinking about relationships since I woke up today. Its hard being a guy sometimes, when you have to work your ass off for everything you get relationship wise. And sometimes it seems like girls have it easy, like things just fall into their laps. Well, that isnt entirely true, but there is some truth to it. And so when something falls into a guys lap, he sometimes fails to realize. Sometimes he is working so hard to get a little smile out of one girl, he barely notices another girl throwing herself at him. And finally, when the guy, who like all other guys, is oblivious, has this pointed out to him, he has NO idea whatsoever what to do about it. And so thats where I am now. 

I think I'm going to close this one out with a ""Boy Meets World"" quote 'cus I'm just cool like that.
 ""From the beginning of time, men have been idiots. Of this I am sure."""

"event","It was a pretty good Thanksgiving this year. Small group, only my immediate family minus my Grandma who is in Florida, and then my other Grandma, my Aunt and my Cousin. It was fun, I basically just watched football and played guitar untill we ate, and then they went home. I listened to ""alice's REstaurant"" at noon. Good Times. I watched The Blues Brothers, which is a crazy kick ass movie and it makes me happy every time I watch it. I wrote a really good song, in A minor (so you know its got to be good). I've been thinking about lyrics for it, but nothing quite fits yet. We'll see what happens.

You know what is a great thing? Just sitting there with your arm around some one you love. I've been in relationships before, and I look back on having some body I care about lying in my arms more fondly then whenever I was hooking up with them. It sounds cliche, and thats because it is, but sometimes you just need the ""human touch"". It gives you a sense of securtity, or maybe a sense of sanity. Which might explain why I'm so insane.

I've been trying to think of what I'm thankful for. I'm thankful first for my family, all of them, even the distant relatives that I don't really like. I'm thankful for my new cousin, because he is to young to be thankful, but I'm afraid to think of where he would be now if he wasn't with us. I'm thankful for my friends, who listen to me, and inspire me. I'm thankful for music, because its the only language that I truly understand. I'm thankful for the theatre, because in all my life experiences nothing has showed me that fiction and reality are so closely related. I'm thankful for the small number of people that I've been blessed with who actually have a small understanding of the way my mind works, because even insane people need someone to relate to. I'm thankful for my life turning out the way it has, because right now I'm pretty content, and if I didn't have my regrets, who knows where I would be today. Finally, I'm thankful for anyone one who has told me they loved me and meant it. I love you all too.

My parents are in LBI and I was out late last night so I'm just chilling for now but I need to get to my homework. Last night was Julie's birthday, and it was awesome and lots of fun. Everyone there was a little crazy for my liking, but it was still awesome to hang out with everyone. I think people get the wrong idea of me because I'm quiet or sXe or I just don't do things that everyone else does if I don't feel comfortable doing it. Thats just the way I am I guess. But thats allright. Anyway, the party was lots of fun, and Happe Birthday to Julie even though its officially tommorow but I probably won't update tommorow so this is the best I can do. Peace."

Saturday we me Chris and Vanagas went to have practice with Colin. He is a straight up metal head, but he is rock solid on the drums. He knows where its at and he is definatly good. We are going over there next saturday also, so its a good deal. I don't know how long he will be able to drum with us, but I hope he can stay on with us and everything works out because it seems like the band has a ton of pottential. Saturday night I was going to see Mr. Minard in Nyack, but I didn't know if tickets were needed or what time it started so I didnt go. Today I went to the Giants game. It was definatly a lot of fun, even though they lost. Now I have to do homework, which isn't the best deal in the world, but whatever, its got to be done. 

I've been thinking so much lately. I really am going to need to start living. Life is about living, not about thinking, and not about waiting. If you wait to long to live your life, eventaully its going to pass and you won't even realize it. Whatever, I hope things work out the way I want them to, but they never have before, and I've gotten by anyway. Life is mostly dissapointment, with a little joy thrown in. I've only been around about 15 years, so I haven't gotten to the joy yet. Eventually, I'll get there, and I can't wait. Love-Jon"

I danced (and yes, it was a hillarious sight to see), I hung out with some people who I didn't know to well before last night but I am becoming great friends with, and I got to go with the prettiest girl there. So thanks everyone who made it awesome for me, and I'm sorry to the people who didn't have as good a time cus of some drama and crap. Wow.

I'm tired as hell today. I didn't go to bed until about 3 o clock. Danielle's house was fun, it was kind of a drag Mishal couldn't go. I wanted to drive her home, but she left right after the dance. I kind of felt bad about that to. I don't know if she had as good a time as I did, basically 'cus I can't dance and I'm not that great of a date. I hope it wasn't a complete waste for her, I don't think she would tell me if it was.

Honors classes and whatnot are fine in seclusion, but when you factor in the fact that every class I'm in is honors, I get a buttload of work that I don't want to fucking do. I've been looking foward to only one thing for a while, and now I can't even have that. I've been saying ""just survive til the 19th, you're almost fucking there""...

I guess not. So no RCR at the Continental. No CD release party. No drunken punk rock love for me. No 5fi and DGW, hometown heroes representing Rockland (and the Bronx, but we know they like Rockland better). It fucking sucks. I can't stand it.

"event","It feels so good to be alone right now. I feel like I'm standing on top of a hill in the middle of nowhere, just standing and looking out over nothing, or everything. Its a good feeling. Another good feeling is knowing that you have what you wanted. Knowing you would rather be alone then angry all the time. I like that feeling. School starts soon, and my attitude towards school is kind of weird. I'm not going to hate on it or anything. Its just new. Its a bigger version of the smaller picture. Hopefully I'll have some new oppurtunities, but really I just want to do well and go on to better things.

Acceptance is a weird thing. I'm so moody that exceptance usually doesnt last me that long a time, but I think I've stumbled across some acceptance. I accept the fact that everything they're saying is true, and I wouldn't have it any other way. I know I alienated them, I know I was a complete dick, and I know that I don't act that way with anybody but them. I know what they say is true, that I really am that bad. I failed, and I'm not a good person. I'm so glad they can realize it and say it. It makes me feel good. I'm not upset, cus I know its true. And I'm not gunna worry about it cus whats the point in that. I don't care that I hurt them. That sounds rough, but I don't. I kind of feel bad that I don't, but it doesnt change the fact that I don't. I don't care that I hurt them, and I'm just glad I didn't hurt myself. Only thing left to do now is move on. Thing is, I don't think I'm quite sure what I'm moving to. Guess I'll find out soon enough...

I'm kind of in a bad mood. I'm not very often in a really good mood, but right now I'm a little pissed off.

I am kind of insane. I have trouble expressing myself, and I can only do it well in one way. That way is through music and lyrics. When I write a song its like taking all my deep thoughts and my soul and putting it on paper. Its such a pure act, and its one of the most difficult things in the world to do. And its special to me, and I hold it close to myself. So when my friends come to me and ask if they can use my lyrics, its really hard for me to say yes. Its like taking my soul, and my thoughts, and all that I really have ownership of and just handing it over to some one else. It may sound over dramatic, but its hard for me. Even so, I still did it, and I gave them my 3 years of work, and my emotions, and my passion. I handed it all away. And if it had ended there it would have been fine.

But when I find out they are talking shit about me, it makes me think twice. They don't deserve my hard work, and emotions, and passion. They don't deserve any of it. So I'm not gunna start anything, but let me just say that if you think of yourself as a good friend of mine, I probably don't like you. I probably don't want to see you, or talk to you, or hang out with you. So leave me alone. The End."

Okay, I feel like Maks and Eric after that ""wow"", but it needed to be said. Summer is almost done and that is some jacked shit. I hate school. I really am doubting right now if I can survive another school year. I need to just put in my time and get the fuck out of here. All life is is work, but I have to find a way to make work a passion or desire. I doubt that will ever happen, so I'm pretty much stuck here.

This summer I've had the most horrible writer's block lyrically. I just can't write, its driving me insane. But on a lighter, or darker note, however you want to look at it, I usually write best when I'm depressed, and I'm usually depressed all through the school year, so I'll soon be able to write again. Good timing too, cus me and Vanagas are reving it up for this project. It is going to be so original, some never heard before shit. I can tell this is going to be the funnest and most rewarding thing I've ever done musically. Good Shit.

Why does everyone insist on trying to scare the shit out of freshman. Every teacher is telling me how I am not prepared, and how much work I will have to do, and how my life will suck and I will die cold and alone. Even Mr. Herd is trying to scare us with the ""greater responsibility"" bullshit. Its like, chill dude, its fucking band, its just a fun class, thats all. Highschool is going to suck ass. I don't think I'll have any friends, and if I do, they won't be real friends, just buddies. There's only one person in my life that I can relate to right now, and honestly, I don't think she really cares all that much about me. I mean, I know she is a friend, but I wish I could do for her all that she does for me. But I can't, and I feel guilty about it.

I want to have a band practice with my new guys, but Opoku won't have a set for a while. Its really gunna set us back, which sucks, because I really want him as the drummer. Maybe we can come up with a sollution, untill then we just have to write the songs and play some rock n' roll. Plain and simple, that is the style of our music. No fancy shit. Its called rock n' fuckin' roll. Dig It. I'm out. Seeya later..."

"event","This entry is for my own sanity. I think I'll call it ""Lessons Learned and Remembered in the Summer of 2004""...here it goes.

1)Don't trust anyone untill they earn it. Trust is not there until people lose it, its not given until its earned. Always remember that.

2)You can't change people, you can only change your reaction to them.

3)Sometimes, you have to know the difference between people who are genuinely nice, and people who are just nice because they have nothing better to do. This will prevent you from getting your feelings hurt.

4)Never fall asleep on a bus with a bunch of your friends; they will draw on you.

5)If you work hard enough for something, and keep plugging, eventaully it will happen for you (hopefully).

6)Pretty girls that know it, are dangerous.

7)Pretty girls that know it, but pretend they don't know it, are even more dangerous.

8)9 times out of 10, girls from New City are bitches.

9)Don't say things you don't mean, even if you're trying to protect some one's feelings because even though your intent is good, you're still doing the wrong thing.

10)Try not to get caught up in the moment, or you might regret it later.



I'll add to this list at the end of August...peace"

"event","Today I went with my mom, dad and grandma to see ""Miss Saigon"" at the Westchester Broadway Theatre. It was very good, and it left me with a feeling I can't describe. I had the same feeling after I saw ""Les Miserables"". The story was so sad, and it really showed what people will do for those they love, and what a horror the Vietnam War was. It was an amazing show, and I highlighy recomend it to people who like musicals, love stories, etc.

Things aren't always as they seem. Just when you think you're in command of a situation, something shakes you up. And just when you think you're knocked out, and theres no hope, and its useless, and you finally move on, you get sucked back in. I hate not having the answers, and knowing that other people do have them. I have having to make assumptions about important things when some one could easily tell me the facts but they won't. Mostly, I hate making the wrong assumption. That just makes me look like an asshole. 

Acoustic guitar is a beautiful instrument. I love writing songs on acoustic guitar, even if they are hardcore or punk. For some reason, the writing process is just easier on an acoustic guitar. Whatever, I need to hang out with some people, I haven't been out in a while. Maybe I'll give some1 old a call. We'll see...

Summer is going good. It was slow and easy and relaxing and lovely until camp started. Now its fast and strenuous but also lovely. I am a CIT for a group of boys, ages 6-8 with one 5 year old. Turns out the 5 year old is the coolest one in the group. His name is SteveO, and he is one bad ass mother fucker. I was going to be the skateboard instructers apprentice but they switched me at the last minute. Its all good though, cus my counselors are mad chill and they let me do whatever I want. I still get to skate a lot to, which is sick, and I'm getting into it, and starting to get good again. I landed a heel flip twice today, I came close on a couple of kick flips, I landed 180's regularly, and my ollie got up to the right height. I also dropped in and rode a 4 foot minipipe. That was a big deal for me. The last time I rode a minipipe, it was 3 feet, and I was learning how to drop in and I got fucked up really bad. Like, couldnt walk for a week bad. And today I went on the deck, looked down, and i just kept freezing, and after 15 mins. Tom convinced me to do it. So I did. I stuck it like a bitch, first try, went up the opposite wall and 5-0'd the coping. I felt so happy, so accomplished. Sometimes I lose interest in skating, but until this day, its the only thing that can give me that feeling. I mean, music gives me powerfull feelings also, but not that exact one. That feeling for me can only come when I'm on a skateboard. And I think thats pretty cool.

"event","You know what sucks about being in a relationship with a person who knows you very well? Sometimes they think they know everything about you. Nobody knows everything about you but yourself, and when you're that close to somebody, they begin to assume things that aren't true. They try to ground you in reality, but they don't really know what they're talking about, so instead, they ground you in their percieved reality. And they don't even believe you when you go to them and say that they're wrong. They assume you're in denile. Well I'm not one to deny anything. Ever. The End..."

"event","I feel so alone right now. My house is pitch black, there is nobody home, I feel tired as hell even though its not that late. I want to go lift some weights or ride my bike, I just feel like I need to push my body to the point where I collapse from the fatigue or the pain. If you know me, chances are I don't want to talk to you right now, so sorry in advance for being an asshole. I have nothing to say, except for the fact that I'm a fuckup. I think way too much, instead of being a fool who isn't afraid of rejection as Billy Joel put it. Last night was awesome, just hanging around with the boys like old times, and then just like that, I get the burn. What a surprise, I seem to get the burn a lot lately. 
People keep telling me that I'm never going to find a girlfriend if I don't put myself out there. Maybe I don't want to fucking put myself out there. Okay, I DON'T WANT TO BE OUT THERE!!! If you think that is self destructive, well, you've all done some self destructive shit in the past and I know you all hated when I got on you case about it. I'm sorry, I'm sorry if you think its pathetic that I'm alone and it isn't changing. But the fact is, I'm alone, and it isn't changing. Fuck, I need to go do something. My parents aren't home, if the street lights are on, I'll go for a ride. Peace the fuck out..."

"event","I'm so tired. Last night I was supposed to go to see the River City Rebels with Chee and Pakidis and my damn recording session ran long and I couldn't go. I was pretty pissed, but its allright I guess because I got the damn song done. Its called ""White Dress"" and its for our music project in Minard's class. We are going to master it tonight after band practice (if we have band practice) and then it will be done. I spent 5 hours on that shit, so it better be worth it. Today I'm basically chilling. I need to do a makeup lab for Terry, which sucks, because he is a dickface. I want to have band practice but I doubt its going to come together, but whatever. 

I got a new cd player and hooked it up to my amp and speakers. Holy shit, its amazing. I spent all day listening to ""Fields of Athenry"" by DKM. That is one of the best songs ever written. I didn't get the lyrics when I read them, but when I heard them in the song it all clicked and came together. Its political, but not directly. Its social, but not directly. Its personal, but not directly. But its soooo powerfull. I love it so much.

I'm hitting kind of an unhappy streak in my life. I feel like I really can't trust anybody. There's always some one with looking to stab some one else in the back, and it makes me wonder if I am that some one, or that some one else. Its kind of disturbing. The people I talk to either frustrate me, or are so wrapped up in themselves that they couldn't care enough to offend somebody else. People I used to trust have shown that they are just as bad as everyone else. Everyone is out to get some one, and no one is out to get no one. For once I want to be a nobody. I wish people would just stop caring about me. Either people care too much about me, or too much about themselves for their own good. I wanna fade away into the background and be done with it. 

If I was suddenly gone, I know people would miss me, and thats annoying. I wish I could just be disposable. I wish I could drift, and come and go as I pleased. Having power over the way somebody thinks or acts is most likely one of the most fragile and trying positions that a person could ever be put in. I wouldn't know, but I could guess so. And I know enough to see that I would never want to be in that position. Some people are too stupid to see that. They are envious of something that doesnt deserve envy, which is the definition of stupid. People are so frustrating. I'm going to go slip into nothing and go meet nobody at nowhere. peace..."

"event","Thanks girlie, I had a hard time at first deciphering all that ""codes"" because this place differs from most forum formats by a large amount....but at the same time only in subtle details.

Well, I survived V-day no worse for wear...and it was one of my cheaper holidays, which is the only real benefit to being single on that day. I also managed to get a much needed haircut. Which is located here in a

Me, personally, I prefer my hair short. I only like it short because its easier to manage. The ""fro"" was a neat novelty, but I just couldnt stand the mess of fur on my head anymore. It was becoming quite the trouble to keep in any one direction. And by the time I actually manage something out of it, it takes an hour or so to end up back where I started. 

I also have a newfound respect for you women and how in the hell you maintain your silky soft mane, will remain a mystery to me. I tip my hats to all of you with longer hair. You have alot more patience than I. ^_^ So...what now? Well the great news of the week is Dad managed to get the Storm running properly again, so I can go out and try and make some money. Hooray. And the first place im headed...the Employment office. I figure I should be able to find me a nice entry lever IT job with the experience I have...who knows maybe I can join Charter cable and make that place run alot better *rolls eyes* as they desperately need the help. Well, its off to hunt tommorow. I hope all of you had a pleasant V-day."

"event","Well, things are pretty uneventful as usual. I just have a major gripe on my head for now...it seems a close friend of mine (my best friend actually) has been seeing a girl for over 2 months. We met her at Roadhouse grill and I mentioned that she was pretty attractive and my friend agreed...well then he got a call from another girl he was seeing and he went outside to see her. During that time, the girl I was interested in sent her friend over, who then asked if my friend was seeing anyone. Me being a buddy said ""No not really."" We ate our meal, he left his number, and theyve been seeing each other ever since. Well my friend has always had a hard time commiting after the 11 year failed relationship with my cousin so things are still no different now. Well, they come over to hang out at my place all the time, which is fine by me since they cant meet at her house for a jealous father, and he lives 30 mins out of the way from her. Well, she talks to me about any prollems she has and I talk her through it and advise her as best I see fit. I have always been the guy gals come to to talk out a problem with...even that isnt a problem. I guess the only problem is me getting tired of my advice not being used, and then having to hear a person complain about how they messed up or how bad someone is treating them, and then admitting that they wouldnt leave a person because of it. I dunno maybe im lonely, maybe ive hit the point in my life where I would like more people to interact with and not have to listen to incessant whining just because someone wont listen to advice when it is asked for and given. I had a nice quote from www.bash.org that pretty much sums it up....

""A woman has a close male friend. This means that he is probably interested in her, which is why he hangs around so much. She sees him strictly as a friend. This always starts out with, you're a great guy, but I don't like you in that way. This is roughly the equivalent for the guy of going to a job interview and the company saying, You have a great resume, you have all the qualifications we are looking for, but we're not going to hire you. We will, however, use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. But, we're going to hire somebody who is far less qualified and is probably an alcoholic. And if he doesn't work out, we'll hire somebody else, but still not you. In fact, we will never hire you. But we will call you from time to time to complain about the person that we hired.""

I just cant stand how women can put men through this kind of stuff. I wish I could say that was the first time it has happened, but it isnt. It happened at Halloween last year when I was talking with this girl, who seems to be interested in me, as I was her. Well we hit it off pretty well until my friend (same one mind you) comes up to see how I was doing. He has a 2001 Transam, and is in a good place with a corporation at the moment, but she didnt knoe any of that info. Well, she was still into me for another hour or so of talking and then she made a comment. ""Man id like to know who owns that sweet Trans Am, that thing looks nice"" I agreed and mentioned it was a friend of mines and she suddenly shifts attention from me, to him. It is infuriating enough to know that your friend could (but wouldnt) come up and just command that kind of attention from a girl with his general speech. But to have attention to shift in that small amount of time over a car...it was upetting to say the least. She hung on him the rest of the night, much to his displeasure. He just wasnt into her. But gave her his number nonetheless. He also gives her my number as well. Well a few days pass and he tells me how much she has been calling him and its annoying him and he soon after stops answering her calls. She immediately turns her attention to me and begins to pander me about him. ""Where has he been? Why wont he answer my calls?"" Over and over again and again. I finally had enough and admitted to her ""Look, hes just not interested in you. There is nothing there"" No sooner than I uttered those words did I hear the most conceded self-centered sentence than I did that night. ""Whats wrong with him, is he gay?""

   You have to be pretty stuck up to think someone obviously is gay if they arent attracted to you. I soon thereafter stopped answering her calls as well, and discovered that not getting with her was for the best. But it still urked me that I was being overlooked as a person, over material possesions. You could say I feel like that whole situation is being revisited with this girl he is with now. We dress differently. I am a gamer/computer geek. Tis true. Aunighthawk can more than admit to that fact. But, I like to think that I can dress to impress as well. Obviously, again I was passed for style over substance and it is just beginning to become quite the nuisance. I DO speak in anger in this post, because I just got done listening to yet another one of those ""Oh i feel like im getting treated so terribly and blah blah blah.."" sorry ive lost my sensitive edge after 27 days straight of the incessant bickering and complaining of it. At first I could actually give her decent advice, but she never listened and did it her way. Then complain to me about it the next night. So this week has gone something like this...

Girl-""I just cant take this crap from him anymore he wont open up to me. I mean he goes out with some friend that he hasnt seen in 5 years and buys him and his GF a 90 dollar meal and then says he will call me then he doesnt. I just dont think I can handle letting him drag my feelings on the floor like that anymore.""

Me- ""yea, just do whatever. Youre your own person and you can make your own decisions about it better then ma it seems.""

Girl-""Yea but what should I do""

Me-""Youll figure it out.""

I no longer care if I come off cold, or callus because ive ben telling her the previous 27 days EXACTLY what to do, but she refuses to listen and take things slower with him and allow him to open up...she wants him to say ""I love you with all my heart"" in a matter of a month and a half of dating...not even serious relationsip..

And watchin her just kill herslef over this whole thing makes me wish I was in my friends shoes....because I long for feelings like that. I want to feel that emotion again. I want to feel the embrace, the touch of silky smooth hands over my face. I want to kiss velvety soft lips. I want the loving feelings that deep down  make me wish I was still married.....or with someone at least. I dunno thinking about how lucky my friend is and how much he is taking all of that for granted makes me sick to my stomach. Ill hope to once again have that feeling. But I just dont see it anywhere in the near future for me...alas with so much to give, there is no one to take."

"event","...Well, I wish I could say that the new year has been very eventful and fortunate to me, but I cant. I also wish I could say I'm a successful person at the moment, but thatd be a lie as well...I suppose it has been quite the wild ride though..

Tattoo's, Firing from work, loss of vehicle, gain of business without a gain of business...Where to begin?

Well I suppose I can start from the top..as I had reported before, I was fired from PC & More Inc. for not doing what the dictator asked without question...(Many of you are aquianted with Mike) Well just a few short weeks ago, I was scanning www.wsfa.com and i stumbled across a rare gem of news....a gem so rare, it simply HAS to be shared so let me get the exact article..<shuffles through the millions of bookmarks>...AHA
http://www.wsfa.com/Global/story.asp?s=2797761 there we go...it seems Mike, oh excuse me, NOT Mike...Mr Ibrahim Mohammed Jallad is his legal name..Well Mr Jallad has been involved in alot of dirty, and bad things. And all I can really say there is...isnt Karma a bitch? Now, I only say this because I too, have felt that sting (and i'm sorry for everything girlie...and I mean you...as in the only person I know of that reads this blog...) Well, read up if youre curious...it was entertaining to me. Still havent receieved a paycheck and I dont see a W-2 in my mailbox either, so I suppose he is just going to bury himself with illagalities..oh well thats old news.

New news..I have aquired my very first tattoo. Its a symbol a very close friend of mine drew up for me to symbolize my suffix on my name (to the uninitiated, I am the 4th) and I had it placed upon my right arm. I will most likely post it up as my new face of LJ very soon. Granted all the glitz and glamour associated with the body art is gone, it is still a symbol that will stay with me a lifetime, and is something that genuinely sets me apart from my predecesors (III, Jr, and Sr.)

The Geo Metro has officially died at 187K miles..It was having all kinds of performance issues before I took it down for repairs due to oil leaks, poor spark, and other timing issues. Upon completion of the services the car would not time correctly. We had figured it was an electrical issue because the car ran great before...but upon taking it to a trusted electrical shop we have in town, we realized the engine had 10lbs of compression and needs a major top-end rebuild to be the ""egg"" it once was. So humpty-dumpty is off the wall, as are the 2 other backup vehicles. So my new role is ""shade tree mechanic"" until I can get at least one vehicle up and running. 

The computer business is making me enough to pay my bills and scrape by with a meal or two when a friend wants to hang out, but other than that...life is pretty uneventful. And so I had to make things a bit more eventful, by basically making up an exercise routine which consisted of 25 pushups & situps...and has evolved more into a lap around the block and 40 situps and pushups..It is a trend I began ever since the new year, when I weighed myself and came to the horrible realization that I had hit 280lbs....so my target for now is a solid 220...and last I weighed, I was at a nice feathery (as compared to before) 243...I def feel an improvement in myself, but I just feel like I should have done a before after shot or something for more motivation. I suppose you dont notice the changes in yourself so much as others around you do. 

Oh well, theres a more goal-oriented person hiding behind the fuzziness than I realized..Just have to set those goals more I suppose...y'know, to see where ill end up"

"event","I just dont know what it is about this time of year, i always stert off ecited and giddy but by the end i just want to ring out-of-towners, shopping rushers, and overall stupid peoples necks off. But through it all i always end up makin it by and gettin all my loved ones thier gifts by about thanksgiving or within the first week of December. Even though this year was by far the tightest budget ive had to work with, ive still managed to get everyone taken care of. I have a friend online that ive known for well over a year now, who has 2 children with 3rd on the way, that i asked how her and her kids xmas was going to be. Knowing her background the 2 children were from a deadbeat dad and number 3's dad she hasnt heard from in over a few months. (I'm going to hunt down and castrate every last one of you bastards once i amass my wealth big enough to rival Bill Gates, take care of your irresponsibility for craps sake) Well, i happened to ask her how xmas was goin for them so far and i came to the startling realization that even though she makes enough to support the kids and herself, she has been unable to get the children the first thing for xmas this year. The tree hadnt even been put out, and Santa's ""identity"" was at stake. Well since ive known her for as long as i have i began to count up the money i needed for my expenses and the money i could set aside for my ""mission"". I immediately jumped onto toysrus.com and began a search for a gift for a 3 yr old boy and a 7 yr old girl. The boy was simple when i stumbled across a tonka bright red firetruck. Nothing extravagant, nothing too too expensive, since even i was on a budget, but a definate gift that would bring years of joy to his life. Now the hard part, the girl. At 7 yrs, a girls taste can be as touchy as a grown womans is for makeup and hairstyle. I immediately clung to polly pocket as an idea. I decided to stay away from barbie since mattell made her the toy-line whore with preggy barbie, and some of the more questionable outfit-laden ones. I mustve glanced at a polly pocket toy that i thought was something it wasnt. I ended up ordering a polly pocket playhouse tent, that she could climb inside kinda like a fort, but for girls. I was tempted to cancel and opt for something else but as soon as i ordered it and finalized my order my friend told me about what her adorable daughter was doing in her room today. She had taken the bedsheets and clothespinned them around fro various places and made a tent. God Himself couldnt have intervened any better. The best part is, even though she didnt get anything for xmas herself, the childrens smiles will turn out to be one of the best gifts she'll have for the year. Im very happy i could bring that miracle about. Now if anyone reads this and thinks, ""oh he's just some kind of braggart that wants to put himself up on some kind of pedastal."" thats wrong, this is the only documented place this deed exists. The package is adressed from santa, and ive told not a single soul in my house, nor friends, nor buddies. I dont want recognition for doing anything but i cant sit aside and not say anything to anyone, so this is my secret buddy in livejournal. I post things here that normally i wouldnt admit. And im long overdue for some posts that are true to me as a person. more to come later."

Will i be able to do it by myself or with minimal help? What happens when the big guys attempt to gang up on me? Hows a little guy survive? I have no doubt i can offer a better service and at a far better price....but will i catch on around the city? Well with any luck theres more than one or two people reading this blog o mine and you can tell anyone and eveyone you know in the montgomery, prattville, wetumpka and millbrook areas that have a computer issue to give me a call. id love to be the big dog one day and with a little help, i know i can offer 1st rate service at a first rate price :D well thanks for any and all support in advance and as for luck .....hell ill take that as well if you have any to spare."

I have found a new passion, if you will. Gunbound! its a game that is as simple as it is fun. Anyone who remembers the turn based game Worms will instantly fall in love with this game. You have to basically choose between several bot characters that each have thier own weapons and abilities. then you fire at your opponents. wind plays a role in your choice as well as speed you aim hold a buttion to ""charge"" your shot then whammo hit the other guy....if your aim is good enough that is. I highly recommend this to the casual gamer that loves blowing stuff up and has a little time to waste. head on over to www.gunbound.net and download it today...best news yet, its completely free no charges period sign up a free account to login with and play away BTW im 4thnobleman so if you spot me on there add me and hopefully we can play together <shrtugs> who knows?"

"event","WOW! is all i have to say I was told once before by a cople of ironworkers that knew my dad and his dad and thay said to me ""the idea of any successful business is to offer something that everyone wants but no one offers. That fact couldnt be more true! Steve's Ringer Shop is a resounding success, offering accessories for LG5450's and similar LG models and even MP3 ringtones for a buck a piece or custom ringers for $2.50 a pop from a CD the customer brings in. So far day 3 of my little venture has left me with plenty of money for minimal knowledge. Who would have though that such a simple idea would net so much business.   On the flip side saturday night i was over at brooke's house just hanging out and telling her about my little business venture (regardless of our past weve always been best friends) and i just happened to get a surprise call from aunighthawk. Pleasant surprise mind you. Well brooke gets all up in my face asking all kinds of very prodding questions. who the f*** is that, one of your little yahoo friends. i reply no this is (aunighthawk) and shes been a friend of mine from way back. That was all the info i was going to give her. i walk into another room she follows. meanwhile aunighthawk asks if she called at a bad time i assured her no, but brooke is still in my face about me being on the phone with another girl, which is really all it comes down to is the fact that i was receiving a call from another girl. She was the one that wanted to break things off and yet shes the one gettin all jealous and psycho about it. Arguement ensues. arguement turns into smart remarks from me and screaming retorts from her. basically i learned what i needed to from her, i learned it was ok for her to sleep with other men, but dear god if i ever get a call from another female she was gonna kill me. welllll alrightythen ms psycho lets se how far you make it with remarks like that. and we'll also see how many friends you keep with that kind of attitude and aunighthawk sweety call me anytime you need to and thx even though you didnt realize what you did at the time i hope youll undrstand that it was an immense help to my future"

"event","Well, as of yesterday at 9:30am i am a freelance tech guy. Mike came in this morning and apparantly got a bright idea about a paper that we had to sign for a ""memorandum of new rules and procedures"" ok thats fine lets see these rules:

1) If you question Mike's authority or rules, hand in your keys and leave the premesis immediately unless you have a good explanation.

2) No cell phones unless it is an emergency.

3) All checks must be verified and signed by employee, and any checks returned after being verified or returnedfor any reasonmust follow proper procedureto collect debt, it is not PC & More's responsibility for bad checks.

4) Everybody gets one hour for lunch (ok so far this is the first sensible one ive seen)

5) all personnel will receive thier check bi-weekly on monday at your lunch break (great i could have used this last week when mike cut me a check at 5 minutes till 2pm)

6) after closing nobody is to be here after 8:30pm (thats great, it means im not up there till 10pm while mike is hobnobbing with friends)

7) casual day is on saturday, wear what you like but please be reasonable (doesnt aply to me i dont work saturday)

8) On business phones no more than THREE personal calls a day.

9) during days off and holidays, NO EMPLOYEES ARE TO BE IN THE SHOP. (Agreed)

10) Customers are not to be in the tech area unless called upon or they are a friend of mike.

11) If you are not busy, make yourself busy.

12) Strictly business downloads only, any personal downloads must be authorized by mike. ( i can deal with that, thuogh i WILL miss that T1 speed.)

13) No employee is to make cd's for any of thier friends (thats sensible, same thing as saying dont give out our trade secret)

14) always treat customers with respect (as if we werent before?!?!?)

15) Show good faith in the company, owner, and yourself.

16) take the time to ask if you do not know that to do, refer to the owner or the manager in charge.

17) three strikes and you are out.


    well now that my fingers are numb, lets review the ones i did not comment on, better known as the ones i do not agree with.

1) so basically mike is god....ok thats fine lets see how well god fares out without any deciples.

2) im sorry i bought my phone, pay my monthly bill and keep my calls to a minimum, for you to just tell me i cant bring it unless its for an emergency is just dumb. like damn emergencies are scheduled or something.

3) ok first of all taking a bad check out of an employee sounds pretty damn illegal to me, it IS the company's responsibility to turn the check in to the District Attourney if im not mistaken.

8) 3 personal calls. ok so if my dad gets hurt and mom calls me to tell me hes hurt, then my aunt an uncle call me to see how hes doin then my cousin calls for the same then my mom calls from the hospital i guess ill be written up. Sorry mike personal calls are just a part of life, and while you should answer the call it doesnt mean im staying on the phone fvor half an hour chit-chatting.

10) ok heres the only problem i have with th people in the back, you cant just say all but these select few. its a double standard, not to mention half of montgomery is mike friend so i guess well just have a block party.

11) wrong mike if i run out of things to do im not moving boxes from point a to b and back again, send this fatass home.

15) let me shed a little light on why i hate this line, mike is a conspiracy theorist. he has never trusted a soul that works for him and probably never will. For him to put such a line in his own rulebook he has got to be the biggest hypocrit i know, not to mention hes jewish, mind you thats not bad jewish people are cool. But mike is definately a bad jew. He lies he manipulates he doesnt eat pork (well i guess thats one good jewish thing he does) but he has no faith in anyone or anything that happens with his own company truth be told he has done nothing but drive away the best team he has ever had.

16) oh! whats this oh great and merciful one? but in asking you what to do that is a direct contradiction to rule number one (hands in my keys and leaves)


   he hands us this paper, demands we sign it and get to work. as he is walking away i sputter out almost immediately ""uhh Mike, im not signing this until you answer some of our questions."" he gets this sinister glare of hatred because im the one that always stands up when hes in the wrong and says ""im too busy to answer any questions right now just sign it and ill answer them later"". a little perturbed i retort with ""mike i just dont think you understand, ill rephrase it. I REFUSE to sign this paper until our questions are answered"" he says ok whats your questions? i had just randomly picked the cell phone rule and had delivered my problem with the ruling stating that i have to answer the phone in order to know if its an emergency. yeah...i know it came out like a smartass but i didnt care because i knew the purpose for the whole damn paper was to run off anyone with an inkling or backbone in thier body. after i posed my opinion on rule 2 he asked are you going to sign that paper? i said not without all our questions being answered. he retorted hand in your keys and leave, which i did. I dont know people, i feel like the last 6 months of my life were just a big waste of time, but thats alright i needed the experience and besides now im goal minded. My life goal now is to make sure PC & More Inc gets put out of business directly from my own doing. Well i dont wanna sound lke a vindictive kinda guy, but working under this bastard for as long as i did made me realize just how much better a person i am than him. welp ill be fillin in some updates on the new business as it happens feel free to comment on what a dick Mike Rodriguez is, im sure by now theres a few haters in the crowd take care yall"

"event","Well i dont have alot of time to feel bad about the past because as of this weekend i became just flat out fed up with the way i was being treated at work. My boss is Jewish (and im not sure if that has any relevance to his actions but from what im told it does so thats why i mentioned it. Well ive been working weekly on a salary based pay since way back in March, seemed like a good idea at the time since it was more than i made at my old job. well i was expecting 40 hours a week. then on thrusdays my boss would ask if i was coming friday. I said im already past 40 hours and can he afford it the forst week he laughed saying he doesnt pay overtime...and from then on out ive been expected to work the 55 hours a week. ok this past week i got my little ""promotion"" to store supervisor. I also received a jump in pay to 110 dollars more than i already made. that was ok i figured sure 55 hours a week at that rate would be ok with me. well this past weekend Ivan hit and i missed a day out of my 5 so i told him i was coming in on saturday to make it up. He was acting like yes you are because your the stroe supervisor you now have to be here every saturday. I laughed sayin you really expect me to work every saturday for the rate your paying me and i clearly stated the amount the last individual was paid. he got on a big rantg about the ""bonus"" i get if i make above 15,000 bucks a month. 10% of anything above 15,000 a month im supposed to pocket as a bonus. keep in mind none of any of this is on paper saying i even originally signed any piece of paper claiming i agreed to work the 55 hours let alone 65 hours a week at the crappy pay he has thrown at me. This highly perturbed me to the point that i looked on the net for the Fair Labor and Standards Act. Come to find out i was owed overtime since day one working there. The first thing the person on the alabama board of labor asks me is ""do you want to file a claim?"" i seriously bite my toungue on that stating ill hold off and confront him about it in person before i go to those lengths. So i put up with his crap today, pissed off by whiny little comments like trying to keep an irate customer at bay by giving them a tutorial that took about 45 minutes. he completely blew up saying i was wasting the money he pays me gettin no ""production"" done. We still managed to move over 7 machines by the days end, but even that he seemed to scoff at like the guy is some kind of computer god or something. it just really pisses me off to no end. No offence but i feel like i wanna become the next hitler or something and really mess up some jewish people after the way i feel im getting the shaft. all the jewish people, and ONE clown...just one clown. oh well rants over, moral of the story im sitting on a piggy bank and i can break it open or let it grow until im ready to cash it in....i have a certain amount of patience so ill waint and see how much of him i can put up with....till then let me go find that clown >:P"

"event","Do you every look at the things youve done over the years and wonder how they can ever be something youd hope for? Theres a girl named Brooke, shes been in my life since junior high school. Ive always tried to hook up with her and finally did before I left Houston Hills. We had been together off anf on since i was 15. the longest span of time apart was probably a little over a year when I got married and then finally divorced. She is probably the most prominent female character in my life next to my Mom but thats like comparing apples and oranges cause Mom is a given in life for most. I care for her like a sister, and i love her like a wife but for some reason i seem to constantly push something between us to the point where it drives us apart again. Well this brings me to today, I still have strong feelings for her, and this is the first time ive felt like she has just truly rejected me. This is the first time ive taken the steps in my life to get it all organized in such a way that i want to start something serious and yet she rfuses to acknoledge lately that she even has feelings for me. Maybe ive screwed up beyond repair, perhaps I have pushed away to the point that she has numbed herself of any emotional bindings to me. It stinks, and i dont know what the hell to think of it anymore. Do i move on? Do i forget the years invested into getting my personal issues dealt with to only to have them shattered in a mere moment? The worst feeling a person can have is the feeling of being powerless to change your immediate surroundings. The lack of intellectual, emotional or physical strength do truly make a difference when it really matters. Its like a torture device that you stick your whole soul into. I think i understand a bit more about my best friend Chris, and how he felt when Marcy left him after 11 years. it took him 2 years to pick himself up and move on. How long should it take me? Ive been there for so many that needed me and now the most difficult challenge i guess is to be there for myself. I have a great job, that pays well but cuts into my social life like crazy. So meeting people is next to impossible except on a saturday night. Its hard to vent in a place like this and not feel like youre looking for pity. I'm obviously not, i just want a place to fill with words a place i can send a direct emotion and let people better understand myself, even if that someone is me. No one person is so simple that you can read their face or thier voice even like a single page on a book. Were all very complex people and i guess thats why this place ended up being created. I wanna say im lost but pride will not normally allow me such a luxury in person. I just dont want to live a life of regret and i think im headed that way. So ill just have to deal with my issues as i see fit and move right along into the life of Stevo, chapter 2."

"event","As of this tuesday im out a head technician/store manager, Manno Mizusawa. He was like a best friend and father figure to me since i started working at PC & More some 6 months ago. He and Mike the owner had some kind of disagreenment and Manno decided for whatever reason he just could no longer work for Mike if he was going to continue being the way he is. Well that was Tuesday and i just have to say wow, during the course of 3 days ive never seen Mike the way he has been this week since my 6 months of hell he put me through. the general atmosphere immediately following Manno's resignation was pure shock. It was like it shut the store down he was like a vital component to operate with and just like that he was gone. Well, asw much as i hate to say it things could not have worked out any better. Mike doesnt start arguements, the overall atmosphere has been largely positive by everyone, we all deal with the loss with almost a sense of joy due to the fact that things have never run so smoothly since ive been there. Well come Monday i have a very important meeting to attend with the boss and his wife/partner about a huge title change from sales representative & technician to possibly store supervisor, along with a fat pay increase. All in all im gonna miss Manno as he was a very close work friend but i guess ill just be visiting that guy at home on the weekend from now on cause i dunno if i want him back. The Geo metro ive been driving for over a year that was a loaner from the parents is on its last leg. So the timing of the increase in pay couldnt have been timed any better than it has. i just hope the ol clunker holds up till i can find a festiva or a civic or some other kinda car i can wear like a coat when its cold out. If anyone in the immediate alabama area has a subcompact they wish to rid themselves of leave a comment because im in the market."

You are a XSIG--Expressive Sentimental Intellectual Giver. This makes you a Teddy Bear.

Hee! I just want to give you a big squeeze. You are tender, honest, generous and fair. You are an excellent kisser and a sensitive, communicative lover, and you know it. You would never intentionally hurt someone's feelings or overstep his/her boundaries. You have beautiful eyes. 

Most people take your laid-back attitude, blazing wit and subtle sexiness and stick you in ""friend."" But some see your extreme hotness for what it is and latch on. This means you have a few members of your target sex in the bank at all times -- I call this ""money in the sex bank"" -- but you're too sensitive and thoughtful to exploit them. More than once. 

You are so rational and deliberate in an argument that it can frustrate and exhaust your partner. Your fights can take forever, but your press on with them until they are completely resolved and both you and your partner are satisfied. If your partner is weak of will, s/he may just give in -- be wary of this! An emotional or passive-aggressive outburst later will hurt and horrify you. 

It is *critically important* that you are able to respect your partner. The moment you lose respect for him/her, you lose everything. 

When you make friends, you make them for life -- you can go without speaking to a friend for years and pick up right where you left off. You are completely faithful, both physically and emotionally. You are the second best (to XPIG) parent of any type. 

If you are male, you have a huge shlong. Just saying.

"event","Well after seeing a friend of mine post her journal on here figured id give it a try and see how it helps. I'm not usually one that talks of my own feelings more so than the one everyone comes to to talk about thier feelings i guess its the gemini in me that loves it so much. <shrugs> Hell, im 22 years old and feel like ive done alot more than most people in my immediate area. Ive been as far North as DC, as Far South as St. Augustine, as Far west as Boulder Colorado and as far East as the beaches of the Carolinas so ive traveled enough. Ive been a Digital Photography Expert, a Sales Rep for various companies here and there. Ive been at United States Steel as a maintenance hand and even led a crew or two during some operations in the Steel-Making industry. Ive had a hand in the local building of the Hyundai plant in Montgomery. Hell ive even been an attendant at the casino. And as for today im the manager or a local computer store off one of the main streets in montgomery. I truly love my current job its a dream come true to me. Ive loved technology since the day i was born. Im a deep down old school gamer beginning with atari, the old 2600 y'know the wood grain design ( you ol-skoo gamers know the one im talkin about) then moving up to the hunkin gray box known as the NES moving up to the sega genesis and SNES thru the years technology has doubled even tripled and much much more. From there i was hooked, then along game the PC, truly the ultimate gamers rig. I dove in to computers head first and never looked back something about the technology and the rapid growth astounds me to this day. Well i think ive gone on enough for today later ill get into my love life, my ass of a boss (only at times) and maybe even some deep rooted regrets ^_^"

You take a while to fall in love with someone. Trust takes time.

You tend to take more than give in relationships.

You tend to get very attached when you're with someone. You want to see your love all the time.

You love your partner unconditionally and don't try to make them change.

You stay in love for a long time, even if you aren't loved back. When you fall, you fall hard.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howareyouinlovequiz/"">How Are You In Love?</a></div>"

When everything is wrong
I come talk to you
You make things alright
When I'm feelin' blue
You are such a blessing
And I won't be messing
With the one thing that
brings light to all my darkness

You're my best friend
And I love you
And I love you
Yes I do

There is no other one
Who can take your place
I feel happy inside
When I see your face
I hope you believe me
'Cause I speak sincerely
And I mean it when I tell you
That I need you

I'm here right beside you,
I will never leave you
And I feel the pain you feel
When you start crying

""Beverly Hills""

Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little whack
And my friends are just as screwy as me

I didn't go to boarding schools
Preppy girls never looked at me
Why should they I ain't nobody
Got nothing in my pocket

[Chorus]
Beverly Hills - That's where I want to be! (Gimme Gimme)
Living in Beverly Hills...
Beverly Hills - Rolling like a celebrity! (Gimme Gimme)
Living in Beverly Hills...

Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean
When the housemaids scrub the floors 
They get the spaces in between

I wanna live a life like that
I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool 
Cause I'm the next big thing!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The truth is...I don't stand a chance
Its something that you're born into...
And I just don't belong...

No I don't - I'm just a no class, beat down fool
And I will always be that way
I might as well enjoy my life
And watch the stars play

[Chorus]"

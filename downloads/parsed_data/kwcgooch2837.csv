"event","....so my mom came through with one of the most unexpected presents for my birthday.&nbsp; it came in a thin square box and was pretty light to pick up.&nbsp; i tore the paper at the corner and read ""honda automotive parts.""&nbsp; that's right, mama bought me a hub cap.&nbsp; after nearly four years of rockin three with character, tis no mas.&nbsp; i'm just another civic on the road.&nbsp; i'm still laughin about it.


and now a survey since myspace has lost its charm.


1.Do you still talk to your ex?
nope.&nbsp; and i'm beginning to realize that it's fairly rare for people to completely cut ties on serious relationships.&nbsp; i guess for me it's just been the product of two similar personalities.&nbsp; 

2. What would you do with 1,000 plastic spoons?
poke someone to death.

3. What kind of music did you listen to in elementary school?
rawk and ro'.&nbsp;

sometimes i'm involved in some pretty cool shit.&nbsp; and i'm at the forefront of information.&nbsp; 

5. Do you wish phone etiquette was required in class?
i always enjoyed phones going off in class.&nbsp; because you know people choose their ring tones because they think it's some fly shit.&nbsp; but suddenly britney spears doesn't sound so cool when she starts singing through cell phone speakers in front of a class of 200.

6. Are you against same sex marriage?
not at all.&nbsp; shouldn't matter if two people care about each other like that.

7. Have you been on a date in the past week?
nah.&nbsp; i find dating awkward.&nbsp; which throws a bit of a monkey wrench into finding someone new.&nbsp; let's just say i'm not anxious to start another serious relationship right now.

8. Where are you going on your next vacation?
the diego of san for steph's bday.

9. Quote a song lyric:
""so come over, just be patient and don't worry.""&nbsp; from the best song on the new coldplay album.&nbsp; no homo.

10. What state are you from?
one of self denial.&nbsp; 

11. Tell us about the last conversation you had in:
i asked anthony what he was doing tonight.&nbsp; he said, awkwardly, ""oh... umm... i'm going out to dinner.&nbsp; well... not going out to dinner, but grabbing something to eat.""&nbsp; i don't get why people dodge the fact that they're going out with their significant other for the umpteenth night in a row.&nbsp; i had no trouble just sayin ""grabbin food with, caro.""

12. What is the time and the outside temperature at the moment?
lookin at my new watch it is 8:06.&nbsp; and the temperature is hell.

13. Have you ever done anything vindictive to your coworkers?
hung a ventriloquist doll from the ceiling of my old sergeant's office for him to return to after having a staph infection.&nbsp; 

14. Have you ever liked someone but never told them?
not someone who i've really liked.&nbsp; i can be interested but know it's better for the greater good to keep it to myself.&nbsp; but LIKE like, gotta put that one on the table.

15. Have you ever gone camping?
i don't care to act homeless on my off days.

16. Have you ever had sex on the beach?
nah.&nbsp; i don't really plan on it either.&nbsp; sand would get a couple places i wouldn't want it.

17. Have you ever been cheated on?
not that i know of.&nbsp; and if it ever happened, then hats off.&nbsp; i was completely oblivious.

18. Have you ever had sex with one of your myspace friends?
obviously.

19. Have you ever felt like you were just completely rhino raped?
what a pointed question.&nbsp; after my calc 3 final freshman year.&nbsp; it was brutal.

20. Have you ever thrown up from working out?
overexertion is a mother fucker.&nbsp; but that was for my younger days.

21. Have you ever gotten so wasted you didnt know what was going on?
oh yes.&nbsp; that's when i simply pull up a chair and check out.

22. Have you ever spied on someone you had a crush on?
facebook and myspace are golden for that.&nbsp; 

23. Have you ever met someone you only knew through myspace?
and dated her for like a month.&nbsp; hahaha, this was an exception.&nbsp; she was my sister's friend in high school.&nbsp; i like to just say i got to know her through email.&nbsp; ok, rationalizing ain't helpin.

24. Have you ever seen your best friend naked?
thank Jesus no.

25. What was the last thing you bought?
a pretty sick diesel watch.&nbsp; this is how i know i'm getting old... i used my bday money on a pair of khakis, a brown belt and the first watch i've owned in about 7 years."

"event","i just had one of the more shocking revelations of my lifetime.

my dad's dad, my tata (yeah i'm mexican sometimes), died when i was a sophomore in high school.&nbsp; so that was a long time ago, well over seven years in fact. 

but for the majority of my younger life he always had his girlfriend at our family events.&nbsp; so if i count the years right, i think he was like 80 when he died so this would have put him in his 70s when he was dragging dorothy to all of these get togethers.

it took me long enough to figure out that dorothy (she was native american with very few teeth... please save your stereotypes) was not actually his wife, but i always thought my tata met her at his retirement home.

but my dad just made some comment about my tata's 20-something girlfriend.&nbsp; after all these fucking years, no one ever told me that my 70-something grandpa was dating someone a quarter his age!&nbsp; 

and i'm shocked.&nbsp; one by my tata's undeniable pimp-ish gangsta but also that this woman was so weathered that i had no trouble believing she was at least in her 50s.&nbsp; 

i'm still in disbelief."

"event","and honestly, i'm not listening to them now.&nbsp; but i can't keep from letting ""pathetic,"" repeat time and time again in my head.&nbsp; seriously, though, that break down at the end of that song is fiiiiiiiiilthy.

it's sad that in times like these i generally take on strong opinions about matters that don't involve me at all.&nbsp; but this will still be a general rant.

i will never understand two aspects of the significant other that seem all too common in relationships.

jealousy and neediness.

they really go hand in hand and what's most frustrating is that for all the complaining that people do about how they bring stress to the relationship, both serve as a kind of twisted validation (between two highly insecure people that is) to keep the relationship going.&nbsp; 

i've had my jealous moments.&nbsp; you're not human if you don't.&nbsp; but i'm talking about stupid shit.&nbsp; finding threats just for the sake of finding threats and to rant and rave like a lunatic.&nbsp; but many people i've talked to say that deep down, a jealous significant other is validation of how much he or she cares about you.&nbsp; seriously?!&nbsp; as the voice of reason, sree, once told me... when someone freaks out about something that does not warrant such a reaction, what's there to make me believe that isn't just a cover for that person knowing they might act that way in a similar situation.&nbsp; that was wordy, but basically if you're accusing me of thinking about cheating when you have no grounds to do so, what is there to keep me from believing that you're just reacting based on thoughts you, yourself, have.&nbsp; and a lot of people talk hard about how devoted they are to someone and how confident they are in their significant other, well if that's the case what could possibly be the justification to getting jealous?&nbsp; insecurity, youngin.&nbsp; mounds and mounds of ugly, ugly insecurity.

and neediness.&nbsp; oh neediness.&nbsp; gaht damn i need to stop.&nbsp; this rant hath already maybe gotten too specific.

just go with this.&nbsp; and any y'all's be jealous and needy on an exponential level, get your life in check!

"event","here's an example for how defiantly my head works sometimes.

i want to get back into working out this week, but i would much rather do it by myself than have my dad tag along with me.

here's where it gets sour for me.  my dad constantly pokes and asks when we're going to start working out again.  keep in mind that we went a solid couple months during the summer, so he should know the routine pretty damn well.  but he won't go work out by himself because he gets ""lonely.""

and the fucked up side of my personality takes offense to that.  something legitimately bothers me that he has continued to ask when we're going to start up again only because he didn't have the drive or independence to man up and do it by himself when my wrist was injured. 

so as my own form of rebellion, i just want to start up my workout routine just like i used to.  alone."

"event","so geoff tried to kill us last weekend.

3 beers, 2 shots of rumple minz, 3 soco limes and a shot of bacardi 151.  you did not read that last listed shot wrong.  that mutha fucka ordered a round of bacardi 151.  and we killed all this in a little over an hour.  needless to say, i puked for the first time ever at a bar.

and geoff is rollin out tonight.  he just sent me a one-word text.  ""hydrate.""  i'm scared.

but that's not the point of this entry.  the point of this entry is the title above these worthless four paragraphs.

after one situation turned sour, a good conversation with my sister and by bearing all too great a witness to certain friends i've decided that i really don't care to pursue anything with a girl unless there is substance behind it.

it's.  so.  fucking.  empty.

such has always been my way by default, but i think now i can definitively stand by it.

and what's interesting is that i have fools of friends actually feeding some girl that i'm gonna be willing to act the opposite tonight.

so if anything even comes up it should be interesting how i handle it.  and if the situation presents itself and i catch shit for how i respond to it, i have only this to say.

why don't you go and take her for yourself and everything you felt i should have taken advantage of?  she's all yours.  seriously, you really will be a bigger man for pulling anything and everything i wouldn't."

nothing more than one of my childish complexes kicking in.  but it really irritates me when it seems people offer their unsolicited ""help"" more to satisfy their own outlook than to actually be of assistance to what i want.

"event","so this week was one hell of a run as far as concerts go.  i came home on tuesday with intentions of starting my thank you cards for graduation (yes i've waited this long to start and my mom has been all over me about it lately, more on this in a few) when i heard the familiar buzzing of my phone.  i looked down to see a voicemail, expecting it to be my mom like usual, only to see that it was other than sreekira who had called me.  my mind started racing like all hell because i knew damn well that ozzfest was underway and if there was one person on this planet who would be calling me because he had a spare ticket, it would be sree.  sure enough, that's what the voicemail was about.  so we ended up making it for the last 5 songs of lamb of god's set, and all of ozzy's.  ozzy has to be around 60 by now, but for as braindead as he may seem, the man still knows his lyrics.  and i can now say i've seen zakk wylde.

wednesday was the show that will now be the only concert to excite me more than my beloved DMB.  dream theater.  it was different this time because they had two opening bands.  into eternity was garbage.  there's an SNL skit where jim brewer does his best scream metal inpersonation.  picture that, with guitar players and drummer who only know how to play really fast and you have into enternity.  redemption was next.  i may actually check out a cd or two of theirs.  but in all honesty, no one was there to see those two bands.  

dream theater is the greatest band you will ever see live.  there isn't a drummer out there more entertaining to watch than mike portnoy.  and of course, my boy petrucci.  it's something you have to see to understand.  because the bands before were playing just as fast petrucci does, but he makes it look effortless in a way that no one else can.    

it's funny that godsmack almost seemed anticlimatic last night after what my dad and i saw on thursday.  but don't get me wrong, sully is still my favorite frontman hands down.  but godsmack is definitely more fun in the pit.

i mentioned something about my mom above, and her getting on me about my thank you cards.  no doubt, i have dropped the ball on those but she called me last week with a different take than usual.  that if i only wrote one, i should write one to my grandfather for how much he sacrificed to give me the amount of money he did.  it's been awhile since i've had the conflicting feelings i had when she said this.  part of me felt bad and part of me felt insulted.  see my grandpa gave me his present in person.  i opened it in front of him.  saw how much he gave me, in front of him.  looked him in the eye and told him how much i appreciated it and how he didn't have to give me anything.  and now my mom is guilt tripping me on his behalf because i haven't sent him some superficial piece of fucking paper saying thank you again?  maybe it's the the product of two different generations' outlook on thank yous.  but even thinking about it right now, i still get irritated as hell.

what the hell is about me having similar dreams to some of my close friends on the same night they have them?  you know how a tight knit group of girl friends can get on the same period cycle, that's how i fucking feel about my dreams!  and this shit has happened with jessica and now anthony.  so i'm crossing all sorts of gender waves with these dreams.

now i'm not gonna kid myself.  i can't actually relate in the slightest bit to anthony's dream.  but it's just funny that the one girl who really got me to let my guard down (for as hasty and premature as it was) has a way of reappearing in my dreams from time to time.  and did last night.  

but this is where i'm going to quote what good ol' mike ditka said in a press conference when he took over the head coaching job for the saints (and i'm aware i just took a turn for the all time random).  ""i don't live in the past.  i believe living in the past is for cowards.""  now for as flippant as ditka came off in that, the man has a point and it really cuts at who i am, shit it cuts at who a whole lot of us are.  and now that i put it in honest perspective at 12:26 on a sunday morning, it really is cowardly and foolish to even think about the idea that i had once for a girl like miss jessica danielle gutierrez even if it is just subconsciously.  the only reason a memory or a hope still exists that deep within my mind is because i haven't had the fortune, or the balls, to meet someone else who i found some kind of equal substance in.  i'm kinda just flowin' with ideas right now.  but at the same time, we're all human.  if it's hard to erase the idea of what jgoot was, then i can't imagine how hard it is to erase the memory of someone who actually meant something.  and for as special as that may be, i can only imagine the hurt when it's actually gone.  but i'm realizing that living there for too long, is cowardly.  

and with that... i'm done with the topic.  never to be revisited again until i actually do cross to the darkside and have something legit to complain about.  

so apparently jessica (real jessica, not goot) and i may be heading to europe in november.  that's if i can get past her telling me i was harrassing (keep in mind, this was like a two minute phone conversation) her last night.  chuckles.  i think that may be worst thing i've ever had said about me.  i'll take drunk and annoying any day of the week and be proud.  but to have fucking ""harrassing"" dropped on me.  ranks up there with my grandpa's thank you card as far as being insulted.   HARRASSED?!  makes me feel like a creep... well.... nah fuck that, i'm no creep.

but i am sleepy.  and i've written way too much.

ANTHONY.  little fuck.  that's why i can't wake up in the morning.  gotta love that that kid adjusted the blinds to suit his own myspace experience on my computer.  or maybe he had nothing to do with it.  

either way, that was a tangent to my actual point of this entry.

in delaying sleep (i'm honestly not sleepy yet) i decided to take a trip down memory lane, and look at some of the entries i, and a few others, made back in the day of fall 04 when i finally got me one of these bastards.

man, reading some of those old entries it's amazing to think how much my life revolved around a very small group of people.  one thing i'm kind of proud of, in my own way, is that i feel like i've kept some contact with those muh fuckas that made up the crew back in the day.  hell i'd even say i consider all of them close friends to this day, where if i needed to talk about some serious shit any one of nicky, travis, mike and jessica would be there if they could.

today has been almost identical to one i had a few weeks ago.  got like 11 hours of sleep to begin with.  then for some reason, passed out for 5 hours from 5-10.  now i've got more energy than i know what to do with.

and i've resorted to pounding beers in an effort to relax... and by pound i mean i'm on my second.  but i'm running out of GAHT damn options here.

i downloaded collective soul's greatest hits today.  gaht damn i forgot how good that band was back in the day.  

here's the real reason for posting tonight.  my son slept in until like 4 today.  believe or not, i felt bored as shit with that little bitch sleeping.  so i started trying to see when incubus' tour started up again coz i wanted to check to see how the setlists were breaking down if their tour was under way once again.

surprise.....

their north american tour kicks on off this sunday.  IN TUCSON. what the fuck is it about tucson mayne?!  why do bands even go there?!  tucsonians need to drive up to phoenix to see the bands they love.  they are not worth of tour stops.  chuckles.  but newayz, the kid and gooch can't pass this shit up.

everything other friends can offer takes a serious back seat to that relationship.  and really the only time those friends seek you out, is to vent about the rough times they're having with their significant other.

and i can't remember the last time i actually listened to one of those bitch and complain sessions.

because guess what, two days later they've made up and are not to be heard from again.  that is until they have another fight.


cyyyyyyyynical.  and also hardly a representation of everyone i know in a relationship.  but some people..."

then i went to office hours for my american political film class just to pick up a study guide that i had lost.  but my professor also took the time to show me my midterm.  when i took that midterm two weeks ago, it was one of those quiet, one-sided battles.  i really didn't study that much and i walked out with one of those, ""damn... i just got worked"" moments.  71%.  hahaha.  it was beautiful.  i don't think i've ever experienced so much honesty between professor and student.  i gave him the ""hey, i'm not gonna make excuses, i didn't really study.""  and he gave me the ""kellen... honestly... you didn't study and still got a 71... just think what you could do if you actually tried.""  again, it was beautiful."

"event","here come some very exclusive livejournal thoughts for yee few who even log into this anymore.  it's gonna be a deep one, a little out there and maybe even whiny to some of you.  but i need to kill time here at work.  this usually accomplishes that very well.

i just read jessica's last post.  i find it eerie how connected dreams can feel to life.  have any of you ever felt you're living a situation that you actually dreamed up before hand?  i can never specifically pinpoint it, but those times are definitely unsettling feelings of deja vu.  there are even some dreams where i think in a completely different way in the dream, and when i wake up i'm able to have a new perspective on a situation that may have been troubling me before.

it was weird to read the type of dream jessica had last night, because i also had a similar dream last night.  different person, obviously.  i can't remember how the dream started out, but it randomnly transitioned into a dilemma where a certain girl was going to come hang with us.  in real life, i'm not on speaking terms with her anymore.  but for whatever reason, she showed up in this dream.  and in the dream i had initial feelings that probably aren't too far from how i would have felt if the situation had actually been real... i was weirded out and a even annoyed that somehow this girl was actually going to be around me.  but then she came and there was this weird calm.  it was the kind of calm i've only felt a couple other times in my life after i have had some serious disagreements with some very close friends.  just a culmination of all that malcontent and bad memories that seemed so important to hold onto at the time, but then one look at her and it all seemed insignificant.  the two times i've actully had that, with jessica and carissa, were such important moments in my life and in this dream i felt so relieved.  i don't even remember what else happened other than everything else seemed to fade away and all i could focus on was how quiet the comfort was to be in this girl's presence again...

but this is where the entry comes back to real life and halts with the mushy.  as i said, i'm no longer on speaking terms with this girl.  it all happened so quickly and was all a result of past ways that she'd acted towards me, things that she refused to acknowledge and even a product of already being pissed off that day.  the day it happened, a little less than 2 weeks ago, i was so content with everything i'd told her.  almost sickly pround that she could try to play dumb and innocent and i could see through it all and tell her to fuck off.  but as the days have passed, i'm not so sure that i'd handled it the right way.  i don't want to believe that she was as oblivious as she claimed to be, but then i'm not sure i needed to be as hard on and as absolute with her as i was about certain things.

it's all very simple to me, though.  most things in life are about options and comfort with those options.  the cold truth is that the only reason i continue to question whether i was too hard on her could is simply because i don't have an immediate way to forget about her.  not that i still want her, because i genuinely don't, but it's tougher to convincingly tell someone like that to fuck off, even in just friendship, when you don't have someone new to be hopeful about.  it's unfortunate that it nags at me even this much because i honestly don't believe the calm i talked about a few paragraphs ago would, could ever happen with this girl.  the two times i've felt that have been a result of me realizing that my attitude has been a lot of the problem.  however (and much like jessica's dilemma in her post), i'm not the majority at fault with this girl and she's never shown any maturity to take note of that.  actually it's not right to claim she's immature.  it's a simple issue of want.  and she won't ever have a want to give what's needed for a friendship like that, at least with me.  i can't wait to have something new and genuine.

i'm always intrigued by people who whole-hearted believe in the phrase ""everything happens for reason.""  at this point in my life, i can't ever read or hear that without cringing.  maybe it's my own arrogance to hate the idea that there is a higher power at work that has planned out the majority the things that will happen to us in our lives.  i very much endorse the basic assumption that things happen so we can learn and grow from them, but to point out specific situations and say ""see that had to happen for me to do this""... that, to me, is foolish.  this is cynical as hell, but things merely happen and people just assign reason to whatever they may be.

aight, this rant has gone too long.  i'm huuuuuuuuuuungry.  pace."

but here's the update on the living situation... there isn't really an update other than anthony and i will likely be splitting up to find our own place.  it might be better in the end.  nothing against mike and james, and it certainly would have been fun living with them, but for all the convenient options that were ignored or scoffed at this summer it'll be better that things worked out this way.

dmb's phoenix show is less than 2 weeks away.  i cannot wait.  i've been watching various live dvds in the past couple days just to get pumped for it.  what's even better is that a relatively new friend of mine will be rollin with me.  should be good ass times, especially in warm up for the san diego and washington trips.

so that's the update on life.  i'm looking forward to the return of school.  hopefully i can meet just a few more good people.  hopefully my sister can find a way to come through with one.  i've seen a couple journals lately longing for the ""chance.""  you know what the ultimate trouble is with us nice guys (and yes i do consider myself a nice guy)... we can be too focused on what we want, and who we want it from.  or we're just ridiculously unlucky.  actually the explanation comes down to a simple combination of those too with the emphasis on being unlucky.  

oh and in this past week i've been able to reconnect with a very good friend of mine.  it's funny that regardless of however i've felt towards her in the past, her opinion of me and who i am as a person and friend has remained steadfast.  it's too bad she has to move back to nau in a few days because the last week has been fun.  it's a good thing mat doesn't have one of these... cause if he did i might have to answer to some unneeded arm bars and leg kicks at practice.

"event","dmb's 3 week break ends tonight.  and we are less than a month from the phoenix and chula vista shows and a month and 4 days from the gorge.

summer is coming to a close.  school starts in about 3 weeks.  i always look forward to the start of school again, and this will likely be the last time i ever experience a new school year.

but this summer has been an interesting one, despite the fact that still a few weeks remain.  it's been completely different from what i imagined at the beginning.  it's been quite the summer for new experiences, both small and relatively large.  so here's my list/look back on a few notable expereinces of summer 06.

-turned 21.  survived my first trip to vegas.
     all and all i don't know if i could have had a better 21st birthday.  it fell on a saturday night so i was joined by most of my closest friends for my power hour.  vegas was a whole lot of fun as well, i just know that for return trips smaller groups are a must.  or have big groups that split up.

-crushed on a lesbian
     hahahahaha.  wasn't all that serious, but it was true for about a day.  after that day, i woke up from the dream.  

-made first gay/lesbian friends
     i've never been a homophobe, but i've never had gay friends either.  we can credit my sister with this experience.  there are far less straight people than not at the starbucks she works at and for some reason it took her about a day to fit in with all the ""cool"" people at her work.  they all just happen to be gay.  and living at home and being as cool with my sister as i am, i had no problem tagging along and meeting new people.  very cool people, just different orientation.

-got in a fight
     haha, not really but mat was able to talk me into trying out some martial arts for the summer and i'm very happy i nutted it up and tried something new.  i've now been beaten up a little bit and have learned things that will be valuable should i ever be in an unavoidable situaton where i'll need to use them.  and i've also been hit so hard in the face that i've carried a headache for 3 days and marks on my cheek and forehead for... well... they haven't gone away 5 days later.  but fun stuff nonetheless.

-started a new routine
     now that one is vague as shit.  but i had a talk with a friend, unintentially, that left me annoyed with a pretty sour taste in my mouth.  it's tough and a bit cold to qualify friendships.  but i have 2 best friends, and the reason why they will always remain on a different level for me is simple:  i can have that same brother-like closeness with them regardless of how much how little i may hang with them during the week.  i entered this summer with a mind for trying new things, and distancing myself from the routine that has been the last 3 years of my life.  i will end summer having experienced a taste of that and, despite minimal resources living at home, with even greater reason to place certain things in the background.  but i don't believe it's remotely wrong to devote more attention to the newer things in your life rather than the old.  not like it hasn't happened to me before.  funny what a misunderstanding can spark.  

-started a different, most positive(ish) routine
     working out is good.  plain and simple.  i don't know why it took me so long to get back in the gym when i have a free one at my disposal at work.  but in 2 months of pretty regular lifting, i can rep nearly 50 more pounds than i could at the end of may.  it sounds lame, but i can't wait to get back on the src courts or on any plane of physical activity with better all around strength.  now if i could just avoid jamming my ankle every time i lace up my kobes.

that's all i have for now."

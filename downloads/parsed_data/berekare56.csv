He brought his brother with him tonight and jaime and I ended up on the phone with rachel the whole time while him and his brother played pool so basically it was just like camp, rachel and I talked while he hung out, It was perfect."

"event","After 3 years of North Farmington I finally had my first attemt at school spirit and I had a great time painting the rock was so much fun, I saw almost everyone that I missed over the summer and I actually yelled, stood in the front row, and was not embarrassed to be the one with the camera for yearbook; if you know me well or saw me and the cheerleader for 2 years that rarely talked then you know that these are big steps for me.  I think camp did it to me I got used to having to be the one to get everyone else pumped, I loved it.  So now on the last night of summer I make myself a goal for senior year, ""I, Karen Rosen, am going to be more outgoing and involved with my class, I will not go straight from class to class, but i will stop to talk to people, especially the people who I have lost touch with over the years""  If you read this and go to schoool with me it is your job to force me to inforce this goal, and i also wanna loss 5 lbs and get all A's (except for physics) and get my applications in for early decitision so we will see how these goals go!"

"event","Tonight-
   Its 1.48AM Britt just left and before her was jenna and jaime we watched the notebook, it was sad and i had a few tears but they were either forced or for someone/thing else im dying for a good cry i feel like it will resolve something but so far no luck.

All girls camp-
   All girls camp is an experience that you have to be ready for and if your not the pure amount of hormones/pre-pubescent girls is gonna knock you flat on your ass.  First and second session I had amazing campers always the youngest but they kept me entertained.  Then third session came and all my favorite girls went home there were still a few i loved but the bad overrode it, I had leslie a pale skinned girl with jet black hair who was totally spaced out, she talked slow and stared endlessly, then theres kelsi who i spent 3 FULL hours (I wish i were exaggerating) trying to get her to put gym shoes on, and finally jessica who said directly to the other campers when she thought i wasn't listening ""I'm never in the cabin cause councilors like me around cause i'm so cute"" and she wasn't, by the end of the first week we called her ""little bitch"" and people know who we were talking about grr she was horrible. 
   Then there was the other councilors everyone was amazing but jaime, rachel, and haley were and forever will be my girls i miss them, even jaime who i saw tonight.  Then there was sam, the boating boy i love sam I dont think he knows that but i do he was so laid back it was always nice to have him around.
   In the end i could not have asked for a better summer, i dont know what to do with myself now that i am home.  My inner demons are killing me and i sick to my stomach that i had to come home from the most beautiful and amazing place and time ever to avoid much needed confrontation and go back to school.

"event","Ok so graduation parties are fun, but as a junior they are kinda awkward, I love the girls that I was invited to there is but everyone else is kinda an acquaintance, and its weird to sit and talk to them.  BUt tonight was Rachel's and Jamie's and I was really excited for it, I got there at a quarter to 8 and I talked to my family for the first like 2 1/2 hours cause I told melina and Lauren I would be there when ever they got there.  Melina finally came with Erik at 10:30 as everyone was leaving but I was so happy and I got them to play volleyball and frisbee with me, and I hit a really cool bump while I was talking on the phone I felt awesome.  Then as they were leaving and the last of the other people were leaving -family, lauren came (I told her people were still there oops) and we ended up looking for my shoe that I kicked off while playing frisbee with Mel and Erik (still not found) and then she drove me to my car and we sat in hers and talked for over a half an hour, I knew I liked her from YBK but tonight I found out that we are like the same person.  I was so excited to met her and become friends with her because I feel like in the past 3 years I haven't made much of an effort to meet new people and keep my old friends, I kind of just gave up, so it was really nice to find out that there are still people to meet and it won't just be Britt and I at our joint grad party next year.

We were just stupid girls like jumping around and dancing however we wanted cuase we knew no one would care.  I was not aware that you could hurt yourself so many times in one night but i mangaed to do it with a bruised knee, side, and toe from limbo and 2 shin splints from the constant jumping on the dance floor.  

The festivities started friday with a family dinner, went on to saturday morning services and brunch, followed by an honorary trip to the mall that kelli, sarah, brittany, zoe and I were more than happy to make, and then the amazing party, brunch sunday morning, family dinnner sunday night, dessert at my aunts and now there are 3 people sleeping in my living room, I guess the activities are being prolonged another day, but im ready to bail out!! g'night!

"event","OK so i just picked Kelli up and drove her, her date, her friend, and her friends date to their dance, their equivalent to homecoming except smaller, no limos or fancy dinners and its on a school night so its earlier and there is probably less drinking.  They were so cute and happy and SOBER, something you tend to see a little more at our dances.  So when i saw them it just made me think what would i be like if i went to JAMD? Kelli says that she is totally different when she goes to school, she has taken JAMD as an excuse to reinvent herself, how often do you get to do that?  I wonder if i would be more outgoing or at least outgoing in general or would i get better grades or have a bigger group of friends? It makes me made at myself for not going because i was too big of a wimp to even try it out, well then again at that time i still had braces and hadn't lost any of my baby fat and that defiantly made me more self-councious, but whatever im at North and i dont hate it, maybe i should start trying to make the best of it."

"event","WOO i have not updated in forever, since last we have lost track of the small animals left in our garage, on our porch and in front of our back door not to mention the one in our living room yesterday morinng when i woke up; I had an amazing day with jaime and val and over eaten for ever dinner for the past week.

Last friday was quite interesting it started with me being a dumb ass i took the extra set of keys from the back door to warm my car up and then put my other keys in my bag cause i didn't have time to bring the extra back into the house, then i got to school grabbed my bag, throw the xtra key in the arm rest thing and locked my doors, unfortunately i didn't realize that the other set of keys had fallen out of my bag and were now on the floor of my car, so i lock both sets of keys in my car, not to mention my wallet which i needed for our field trip to the zoo later that day.  
-So at the zoo i was responsible for bring the digital camera which of course burned out 5 minutes into the trip!
-then when dan the parking lot guy came to my rescue (a window was left open a little) i drove home cleaned my car and called jaime and val to go to royal oak and they decided that they would drive over drop their cars off and i would drive there, but about five minutes later i got a call from jaime saying ""OMG Val's car stalled in the middle of orchard lake!!"" and sure enough she had to be rolled into a sub while her car was in neutral by 2 cops cause her car really wouldn't start, and then we put gas in and it worked!
-so then it took us 45 minutes to get to royal oak and it was a pain
-and then we decided to go see a band play but we walked into this little cafe in downtown farmington and we felt so out of place and there were no seats so we decided to walk about and then we got bored
-but it was ok cause we went to village place and it was yummy
-and we topped our overly exciting day with a cool down in Val's step brothers room we just sat and talk and it was fun  
and thats it for my exciting life, leave me a message it makes me happy

I feel like i have not updated in forever and i know that the last time i updated was not last week something happen with my computer i tried to update last week and it didnt work but it apperently changed the date on my other one weird??

School is still stupid but my parents arent so bad i guess shabbat dinner still suck but i finally growing founder of katie maybe its becuase shes not here?  Tennis ended with a bang.. or 2 we won our last match 11-0 it was wounderful oh and britt and i got moved from seed 4 to 3 that was also fun but i felt bad for Gina cause she is really good but unfortunatly her partner likes to be annoying and loss the placing match for both of them.  Then there was Alexa enough said.  

Lately I feel so cut off from everyone i dont know how to deal with it i feel like Britt is my only friend in school for real not just us joking about it and i love her but u cant just have one friend i dont feel normal today she wasnt here and i didnt know what to do i latched onto Jill Levine like a lost dog im such a loser, i have jaime, val and ash also but what am i gonna do with 3 friends who dont go to my school for the 35  hours a week that im in school? My classes such becuase im in like algebra 2 and chem not physics and shit so i feel like the only juniors in any of my classes are nothing like me, i work hard and i care about my grades, and there are people like me just not in the classes i was put in, it seems that everyone who is in my classes  is the kids who dont care and its hard for me to relate to them. grrr y am i anti social??  y cant i just be normal??

I wont even get into boys today

In case u are wondering the dead mouse comment come from my darling kitty, he thought it would be really nice to not just leave the dead mouse on the front porch like usual but instead next to my dresser on my carpet i almost cried when i heard i made my little brothers friend (girl) go get my underwear and towel before i could take a shower today beucase i wouldnt go in my room and my dad hadent come home to clean it up yet, i read somewhere that cats think they are doing something nice like thanking u or giving u a present when they leave u an animal, 

my cat must really like us."

"event","OK i suck at updating but we knew this since the day i started a LJ, but i told myself that i would update before school started, and guess what?? I didnt OOPS
but whatever here are the things i learned this summer... 

1. 
     Having your license makes ALL the difference 
you can get around without your parents knowing ur every tiny move becuase they put u there, get a job, run ur own errands, and make summer totally NOT relaxing, fun but not relaxing.  When ur parents drive u around u have that lag time when they cnat leave yet or they cant get there yet but when ur drive urself u just go and go and go

2.
      Don't overload ur first weeks of summer
In the first weeks of summer i was NEVER home i went out with 3 or 4 people a day breakfast, lunch and dinner and then out for the night by the 3rd week i didnt know what to do some of my friends had left, I was sick or some and im sure some were sick of me so i sat at home a few nights and got totally depressed, like i had no friends just becuase it wasnt what i was used to

3.  
      If ur gonna make new friends dont forget about ur old BEST ones
I OD on NEW at the beginning of the summer, new girls, new boys, new places etc and I relized maybe a little too late that i hadnt seen my best friends since school got out!  And i missed them and then we kept missing each other!! it wasnt good

4. 
     Just one thing isnt gonna make summer amazing
Traveling, new friends, old friends, having ur license and relaxing are what summers all about for me so without one or the other it just couldnt have been the summer it was.  

Now i updated is everyone happy.

OH yeah school sucks!! but have 6 classes is amazing especially when u have student aid and store operations in there!"

Thursday i acually had an exciting day i went to tennis SUPRISE, which was shortly followed by more tennis, kelli, britt and sherry it was fun then i went out to lunch with britt and Al rice, it was long over due to have plans with both of them, i think we all had a good time i know i did it was fun and easy to talk to them like 8 grade again except they seem to have gone through some changes that i seem to have missed along the way the only change i got that they didnt was getting boobs, woohoo.

Friday, i went to PLum to watch kelli play tennis and i decided instead to put on my really cute new bathingsuit and even out the sun burn, YEAH now im not just sunburned on my stomach but i am on my back too!!! then i came home and visited Ashely for the last time for 7 weeks :( it was sad and i will miss U!!  then i came home and took a shower cause i spelled really bad :( then i went out and skipped shabbat dinner for the 3rd week in a row haha thanks jaime! i wouldent care if we didnt eat at like 830 which means ur not done until like 10 and then what do i do drive to and frmo jaimes and spend like 12 minutes at her house?? but i skipped and we meet jason, nick, and soifer in bham haha i know we are cool like 7th graders, but i had gift certificates and i wanted to see dodgeball, it was soo funny, 
and now im updateing at 1:14 in the morning and i am angry becuase i have a stupid 6th grade crush and it is pissing me off i hate crushes that arent gonna go anywhere, i dont want a boyfriend or anything but i still dont want a endless crush i want to like one person, beucase it could be something good but instead i like the boy who nothing is going to happen with, 

y cant u just chose they way u feel about people, why cant u just get over a boy when u know exactly whats gonna happen, why is life so fucked up!???!???!

leave a comment~ help me OUT!!"

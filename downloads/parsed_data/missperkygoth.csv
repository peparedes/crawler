Yes, LJ, I have long deserted you. But no longer. Especially since my awesome bro hooked me up with a decent working computer for my house.

So, what do you have to look forward to?

1) The real story as to why I am unemployed (this will be a friends-only post, so behave!)

2) Write-ups on <i>The Homecoming, The Women, Dearly Departed,</i> and other theater-related activities.

3) Adventures in working with the KidStage program (especially since we're doing <i>Godspell</i> this summer! ooh, scandalous!)

4) My experiences in roller derby (yes, LJ, since abandoning you for whatever, I've been skating for a couple of years, and it RULES)

5) Blah, blah, blah.

C'mere, friends-list. Let's snuggle."

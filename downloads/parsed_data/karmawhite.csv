s.h.i.t. I never got my best friend a birthday present, Oh. My. God. Fuck.

Spring break has been a lot of chaos and a lot of fun. Equal partions and vola, vacation! 

Sometimes I stare at the sky while the stars move behind my eyes and wonder....

I saw Dawn which was great, chaos there too. She got her car back and I guess the hotel party is not going to happen :(. 

I broke plans with Appie to go to Magic Stick because I forgot, and also I had no money. *cough carl cough*

Kat and I had fun, kristin and the Cooch Juice. Loong story. Never take medicine past the expiration date, especially if you dont know whats its suposed to do or if its for a girl and your a guy. Especially if its a perscroiption. 

Watched Trainspotting last night, and I have to watch it again because we wern't really paying attention. 

Drove around, choas choas, this summer scares me, and Im human. I accept truth and dont lie about limitations or subjections.  

The biggest thing you can learn in life is

It's O.K."

I still do not know what I want to do the rest of vacation. Lesliean. We still need to chill. Alright alright.

Let me tell you a story.

The last Trip I went on I was in Egypt with the Pyramids and the Gods and I saw the rise and fall of Egypt as if in a timeglass. It was amazing.

Leslie, spring break, you and me. Count on it.

Spring break Friday! Yes! I can not wait! I am going to have so much fun.

John McQuiston is back in school which is awesome and I have a class with him.

My ex-boyfriend should be out of the hospital for suicide in a few days, I really hope he gets better, I care about him and it must be hard on him, but I've gone through this before so It's really hard on me.

My brother got second place in Mr AB. Go Andrew. (He deserved first, he was original).

I blow bubbles at funerals and dead bodies make me smile. Im the one who stops at a fire and strains to see someone die. The covered strecher my favorite alter. This lovers quartet of tears is the only rain I've ever felt, and it feeds me, like a delicious poisin. 

Just another kind of sick. The morticians matermind. A puppet upon phramaldahide strings. Let's stick to the chloroform. My favorite intoxication. 

Don't forget to play 

I like to see smoke rise upon a delosate rain soaked place, heat despite this never-feeling-emotion of ice. 

Its a spark in the dark and a glowing ember.... 
A place to start 

I have this need to draw upon my corpse. All I see is endless faces and eyes in my personal asylum. 

THIS IS SIN 

I step softly into my own Secret Garden where death awaits with tea. The burning crickets scream their symphonies to me, my lullaby. Step upon the stone-grey-skulls and dance upon these broken bones, push aside the painting, and step through this malformed collage, pull back the drapes and step-one-two. 

None of this is real 

Upon my swing I sit, as snap dragons curl upon my frail edges and bloody-fireflies dance upon a ruby sky. Vines curl around me and sink their hungry teeth, seek them upon rotting flesh. White rabbit's with eyes of red, suckle upon my wrists, stained, another fashion show, another trend. 

None of it even matters in the end 

A rain falls upon my garden, white trenchcoat stained to red. 

Lost within this painting 

Death grows like an infecting-affection, a deligtfull-defection, an adiction with a earthy aftertase of deadly aphrodesiac. 

Love is greed 

This rainfall-dead with four walls spraypaited 


""TAINTED"" 
""DRINK ME"" 
""EAT ME"" 
""TOXIC"" 


Crimson-colored-clouds fall upon the earth in this rolling fog of red. 


Where flowers bloom white

You realize dear, that it's quite clear, that nothing will be the same. This world you realize, is just a dream, and once you wake, death will be your final scream. Bloody chains and ragged dolls, with drunken confessions all to save your immor-t-al soul. 

This drop-dead-drama-queen he's finally out of breath, the sky, it's raining red. Rusted pipes. Take the snow, press it to your gums, pretty soon you'll be flying again. You can forget your just a has-been-jock, popular till one day, fag's the newest craze, and by chance they notice the way you walk, a lisp from babies beating, and your 

LABELED 

Primed, and ready for sale to the highest bidder with the creulest crack. You used to dream of suicide, screaming inside, because no one would hear. 

""This is a Christian household, we don't like to hear that word"" 

Silenced by crusifixtion, now they tell you to scream, scarred bloody vocal chords is all you have left from a life of a suicidal requiem for a dream. 

Empty bottles and dry needles offer a nice reprieve, so you use, and they use you, drug-addict-gang-bang with no one but yourself to blame. 

When I was five I learned of God's promise, a rainbow, sacrifice. When I was six, I found my own scarlet letter, it consists of all six colors. 

Branded 

By all the pretty boys for the perfect blue eyes. Soft blonde hair fades to black, as first we bleach, then dye, bruises so blue they match the black, like a sadist's smiling back. 

Shaking like a junkie in withdrawl, it's just from dad's voice screaming in the hall. Crossdressing-childs-play, touched in all the wrong ways, to busy for a child you never wanted, you turn a blind eye, and I... 

I stare at the quickly falling sky

Current Persona: Derek an a starry summers night

I have no idea what this says or means. I dont even think it can express my feeings. All I know is that I tried ot write how I feel and this came out, I blacked out and don't know what I wrote. I just hope it doesn't sound depressed and all wrong. True there is a tone of sadness to my feelings but it is most surely overshadowed by feelings of happiness and something else which is like a kind of blank bliss of nothng that is everything. It's the emotion of a smile.

I love John so much. He's so great and I can't wait to see him tomarrow.
I remember riding in the car, wishing to stay that way forever, just to dream in endless nights of slepless bliss, among the stars to stay, while yellow lights flash and kisses upon hads forever stay. Love never meant so much in a world of lust, the word has lost all meaning here, in a picture of a dream, we dare to belong among a steet in the warm dark. This is my dream, and soft voices pound behind through wires and speakers to the ride along the way, softly sining sinking down into you with vanilla softly lingering upon pressed lips.


I feel like Im walking in the middle of a summers night, lost within the stars.

Poetry is the only language I can use to express the way I feel, it is my laguage.

Lacuna Coi the stars never so bright within a room of pitch black spite, where stars begin to glow with visions starry and blurred, a voice upon the phone, with proof enough for you. Always leaning forever longing, finding dreaming, casting waking, always fading, sitting in a chair you speak to pills and whisper to voices as we all dance along in this dream. Casting shaking, shadows dancing in this beautiful form of smoke, smiling shying, olding back in the cold you walk, finding something more, something real, you end in bliss of never more. Slowly dying, desperately crying, slowly smiling upona dawn that as promised has come, to never and a second star you fly away, the worlds chains braking their hold on you, as you stray no more.

Youd better learn to fly, as your walking upo the sky, angels wings dance as they pass on by, no longer falling. Among a cloud of soft sweet smoke, as secrets spoke, you press upon soft lips, wishes of a yesterday, when nerves held and we looked away. A way for a dream, this is my wish.

Loving you. your in my dreams. Another heart another dream, silencing the screams, daring to dream, passing by, the pasts pain fades goodbye.

I'd like to close my eyes and go numb
but there's a cold wind coming from
the top of the highest high-rise today.
It's not a breeze cause' it blows hard.
Yes and it wants me to discard the humanity I know,
watch the warmth blow away.

So do you think I should adhere to that pressing new frontier?
And leave in my wake a trail of fear
Or should I hold my head up high
and throw a wrench in spokes by
leaving the air behind me clear

So don't let the world bring you down.
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold.
Remember why you came and while you're alive
experience the warmth before you grow old."

I feel like a horrible person for saying all this, it's like im sick because I might have what should make me happy, but I'm not. Im just getting pissed off, and I'm sick and tired of it all. If life has worn me out this much in 16 years Im just affraid of who I'll be in 30more.

I feel so helpless. I stil haven't heard back from my fucking agent on my book.

I still dont have a job.

I still dont have a car, or a licence, or even a permit and I'm near 17.

I'm nearly failing all of my classes due to absences.

Do you know what it's like to wake up every day and wish to god that you we're everything and anything but who and what you are? Ever wish you had never been born, every day, every day, just waiting to fuck yourself up on something just to be able to go on for one more day. 

Somehow I keep going on, for how long, for how long.

Last winter I remember crying and screaming to my mother that I wish to God I had never been born and that I thought it was some form of sick joke by God. DO you know what thats like to tell your mother you wish you had died, that you had never been born, and see the way she looks at you?

I just can't find the awnsers, cant see the reasons why...."

Current Persona: Searching My Soul

So many questions yearn to be awnserd and I can't find any of the awnsers.

Faith.

I'm so mixed up right now. I went to this church and these two guys were really nice to me and they're great people and we're kind of friends now but would all this change if they knew I was gay? Sometimes I just wish that such a thing didn't exist. Everyone looks in the mirror and wishes they we're different. I wish I was the same. Im not looking for pitty, I'm looking for awnsers. Sometimes I just need to hear things out loud or read my thoughts in this place to help me figure things out.

How can love be wrong, and hate be right? Or is this just a fasad people place out. Somtimes it seems that it's simply a matter of we fear what we don't know. Other times it seems to be something deeper. Honesty is something this world could use a lot more of. Then we could work things out, and with a bit of compassion you never know.

Which reminds me of Bush's anti gay-marrige fight. What a fucking load of bullshit. You love who you love, gender should not keep people from getting married. If we let same sex marriges become legal, not that much is going to change. We already have same sex couples with children. I mean, the only thing that will change is the title, something that says you're married. It is not that big of a deal. We are infringing on human rights by banning same sex unions. It's wrong. Plain and simple. It's inhumane. Women can vote, blacks are no longer segregated, slavery is gone, but no same sex unions. It doesnt make any sense and I fear that if Bush gets his way it will doom us for years.

Im going to see A Perfect Circle with Alexis, Sean, and Josh. It should be really interesting. I don't know why I say that exactly, use that word, interesting. I guess it just fits for some reason.

Im haunted by a faith I no longer feel is real, yet whispers of when I was young and still believed visit me and tug at my soul. Haunted knowing that once, I dreamed I could have it all. Dreamed I could be just like you. I hate pity, I dont want sympathy. Sometimes I like to dream I'm someone different, as Im sure we all do, I just have the strength to say my inner feelings and thoughts and dreams instead of hiding behind a lie.

This card represents the taking of a loss. He's the sacrificial lamb, whether it's accepted with grace or only because it's been forced upon him.

It is time to cut cords with the past. Bring in the harvest, clear away the remains of the last cycle. The Death card is calling you to shed old identities in order to be able to express new ones, much like a snake shedding its skin. Go through this process of transformation willingly and voluntarily.</span></span></td>

It's a good thing that it's you playing this vulnerable role, and not someone else who may be broken by the situation. You are resilient and regenerative, someone who can view this experience as educational and not be totally victimized by it. This is the enlightened attitude. Your sacrifice will make a difference in the larger flow of events, even if it's not fair and you don't deserve it.</span></span></td>

This card has an affinity with Air and Water in both their destructive and healing properties, the black and white side of life.</span></span></td>

What is your take on the gay marrige issue? Do you think it should be up to the state or national goverment? Do you think it should be banned or allowed, why or why not? Leave the comment nameless if need be.

I want to go to College at EMU. I want to either minor or major in creative writing/english. I am not sure what else I want to take. I have a year to decide, but theres a comfort in knowing.

I know that I am going to be a novelist of realistic fiction and fantassy as well as a poet. 

Interior design, massage therapy? I just cant decide what else to do. Something I can enjoy and live comfortably off of. As long as I get into EMU I know I can make it in life. 

Appie and I went to Trixies tonight and had a great time trying to find it. We are most deffinetly going to go back there sometime soon.

Appie: I hope he gave us the right directions.
Seth: We should go back and ask for more.
Appie: I don't think it quite works that way dear.

Tell me somethin. A secret, a confession, what you think of me, what you hope, wish, dream, fear. Anything at all. It can even be anonymous. Just tell me something I don't know. Surprise me. Let's see what happens.

Have you ever felt like no matterhow hard you try you just might not make it. Do your goals ever seem to get farther away with time, not closer. 

Look back to sixth grade and think if this is where you thought you would be?

Tears fade to smiles, time moves on and scars fade away. Time heals souls and helps ease the past and make room for the future. We might not know what it holds for us, but we can face it with a smile.

Another question for everyone. Define the words Beautiful and Love.

Lost in shades of gray,
In this world of shattered dreams and broken wings,
I have seen more than you care to know.
Lost in a world of frozen tears and hidden fears,
You're blind to see the pain you've caused.
Whispers of a dream withing a nightmare,
The pain of salvation.
One last wish and it all fades to gray.
Chained to yesterday I shall never stay.
I am who I am and I say what I feel,
Those who mind don't matter,
Those who matter don't mind.

Well well I find out some things I found interesting.

AutoPilot is the best band in the world. Alan is a hottie to boot. Wha! Ha ha!

You attack me because you never let me get to know you and then you presume to know me.

I had a blast at the Roseville Theater. Leslie you would have wet your pants, omg. It was amazing, grunge and drugs and everything hot. It was amazing. I wish you could have been there.

I met these two great girls up there and they want to hook me up with their friend. It is going to be awesome. I hope. I just hope I like the kid. Jessica is one of the girls and she's insane. She is so loud and out of controll but I kind of like it. Im not used to it though. Im crazy in different ways. Not so much loud.
The other girl Maire wasn't as goth as Z but she was really pretty too and I liked her quiet way of knowing. I think Marie and I will be really good friends. I just wish we lived a little closer. We live around 10miles away. 

I had such a blast. Then I wen't to Bob's and we watched Saber Marrionett J which takes place on a planet of only men. Knights Of The (Gay) Zodiac, is one of the most hillarious shows I have ever seen. You have got to watch it some time.

Im having an InstantMessage conversation with only smilies. I find this amusing.

I had a good day today. I got high, had some margaritas. Fucked myself up a bit. You know, the usual. Since my best friends became to good for me I'm having to stay here for the nihgt alone, but that's all right. I don't want to be to controlling anyways. They seem to be happy and doing just fine without me. I'm happy for them, honest.

Don't ask any questions. Don't try to understand. Open up your mind and open up your heart.

Pink and black all tied in a ribbon, constricitng my heart, it fades to black and blue. 

I wish I had a car. I need some serious drugs for this kind of stuff. 

We we're suposed to meet Leslie at G'Land but we were late. Taco bell. Yep. Poor Katie wasn't feeling to good. I think it was the food. 


It tears me up inside to see the feelings that you hide. I wish you saw how great you are. I wish I saw what you were worth. You wouldnt have to hide. If only you could see youd never have to run away.

Auto Pilot Concert tomarrow at the Roseville Theater. If my father ever gives me money I can go. I hope he does. I dont want to spend the day all alone. To think a month ago I had two best friends and never would have thought this would ever happen to me. I always said the friends I have in highschool I will stay friends with. Guess I was wrong. 

Talked to Kyle today. Not sure what to say. So many questions and I cant ask a one. Pretending to be someone Im not fits me better than pretending to be me.

Trying to find somewhere I belong I'm torn up inside because you can't even talk to me. You walk right past like I dont even exist. Like Im not even real.

I dream in a world of faded memories and lost dreams in which I am lost.

Hapiness I find in a fucked up crunked up way. Wasted is the only reality I know in which I can find a moment of a smile. Something close to real.

If anyone wants to do something on Sunday leave me a comment or IM me or call. 

Not sure whats going on, something in a Wonderland of Nothing I look Through The Looking Glass searching for something in a world of nothing."

Im sick and tired of being your little toy. 
All you can say is wait. Wait for what.
Another second another day.
In still here living in this hell.
Im sick of all your little smiles. 
Tell me to be happy. You have no idea of my life.

DONT FUCKING TELL ME YOU UNDERSTAND

What do you expect me to do when you take everything I have away?

You want to see my happy, then maybee you should take the time to care instead of pretending like you give a shit about me.

Decieved once again that I had found something, left once again with nothing.

This pain to real for you? Is that you you stay steeped in your silence? How about you walk a mile in my shoes.

I am in love with Brent. I know it sounds odd, and I know that I don't know him very well but my heart says I love him. Im just affraid to talk to him. I know that it's kind of stupid but I see myself risking a lot talking to him. I mean, just rejection mainly but no one wants that. I just hope that I can find whatever I need to get through this and whatever happens. I don't think I am going to talk to him this week or next, someday. I just don't know what to tlak to him about and I don't really have a reason to talk to him about anything other than I like him. Strange thing is if he was a girl I would have no problem tlaking to him. Maybee I should just pretend he is, easier siad than done. 

He seems so depressed lately and I'm not sure why. I wish I knew, and I wish there was something I could do. I wish at times like these I could read minds.

Savage Garden speaks to me. ""You can still be free.""
If that is true then is it right to risk my heart?
I've already had it broken once, I don't want it to happen again.

It pains me to say this, but it has to be said.

Tyler - If you ever had hopes of anything between you and me you killed it. You never could keep your mouth shut and I hate you for it. You have no idea what you have taken from me and i am never getting it back. To make it worse you have to go around telling who knows god knows what. I hate you, dont talk to me, don't touch me, and don't you ever talk about me again. How could you hurt me so much, to think I thought you cared. You are nothing.

Sean - I know you read this. Even though you don't comment. Im sorry for yelling at you, I simply needed some time to figure out what was going on and to find out where people lay on certain issues. I guess that telling you anything was a big mistake, but I guess thats what happens some times. Just when I thought I could trust you again you go and do this. You can be sure of one thing, I will never be telling you anything any more, you already know to much, and you obviously have no problem telling everyone about everything, so my telling you anything is like telling everyone. It was your decisions that made it this way, not mine. Make sure you print this out and give it to Alexis, ok. I know you are happy now, I mean you have Don and all them and Josh and Tony, so now that Alexis is happy I know that you are as well. Have some fun, loosen up, you don't need to be the one looking out for everyone anymore. Lie back and do something fun. You deserve it.

Alexis - I think you need to take some time out, like a few weeks and hang out with Josh, really get to know him, and his friends. I think you should spend some time with him alone especially. Just do what you need to do, like worry about your education and your life during your last year here. Do whatever makes you happy, and make sure to have fun. It looks like you Josh and Sara really hit it off. Im so happy for you. It looks like you and Sean are back to being friends and your two groups of friends should really get together sometime, I'm sure it would be a blast. Seriously, all I want is for you to be happy and it really loks like you've finally found that. Found something that really makes you smile, and you haven't had that in a while. You've found a person who it looks like really cares. And hey, Sean made you happy and you care about him so it really looks like you are both happy now. Im really glad.

I never really fit in anyways. I never have. Im gay, and yeah, this sounds like a sob story but stay with me it makes sense. I can hang out with girls and get along great but theres still a special bond between girls and girls and I never really hit it off with guys for obvious reasons, and a group of straight guy friends is better than one being gay. Think about it, it makes sense. So you all need to just go have some fun, and don't worry about things, just do what feels right to you. Hang out and party, go see a movie, do something fun. It'll be great, I just know it. Im to different, my beliefs and personality don't fit with you, and I see that now, we're to different, it never would have worked anyways. I was just lying to myself trying to convince myself of something that would never happen. I've been so blind and selfish all this time and it needs to stop. I need to open my eyes and stop calling all of you blind. I realize that my illusions are jsut that and I digress into truth."

A witness to a silent kiss so beautiful and sad I cry, betwen two lovers starcrossed in a bueatiful requim of unspoken pain, and I am the only testiment to this love.

If I was as beautiful as people tell me I am then why am I still single.

Today when I left school I saw two guys with their arms around eachother, our school never ceases to amaze me. I filld out the eyecandy quiz as a female so I wonder who I will get as my match. It shuld be really interesting.

Im spending the night at Lexys today, and sometime this weekend, I think tomarrow, I am spending the night at Dawns house.

Sherri, I love you and I am so glad you found somone.

I found my poetry for forensics, and I really like it, I still need one more poem I can tie into my first peice. I know I can find one.

Nothing is importnant, and everything matters. Now nothing matters and everything is important.

These portraits of memory I paint as I look to the stars in hopes of finding you.

I just want a friend, someone to hold. Why is it so misunderstood that my looking at you is a compliment. All I know is that your beautiful and it hurts.

This is sad and emo I know but Im really happy.

I get to hang out with Sara and Rachel and Tony and we are all going ot party sometime soon, and I can not wait. I know it will be a blast and I am stoked about making new friends. These people rock and they really know their music, its like a oasis in a land of sand.

My poetry book is almost done. I have to revise it and then I am sending it in. Sunday or next weekend or sometime this week if I have time I will finish it. I can not wait. I shall make everyone I know buy it and then I will sign it for them. When I have realized my dream and it has come true, I know that I will always remember all of you and you will all be the people I forever care about. Sometiems all we need in this world is one pure dream.

Meditation is going well and tonight I will be meditationg and astro projecting. Ill fill you all in on what happens sometimes soon. I have this feeling something new and great is going to happen.

Dreams are my world and I live in a palace of wishes. Broken words and screaming whispers fill my mind in a symphony of magic."

You are what is known as a dabbler -you have no real focus in life so you go from subject to subject some that you barely understand but feel like its important to know. You surround yourself with an air of darkness and probably to others seem the depressed or dark individual but in reality you are much like the rest of them with a bit more insight. You try very hard to not be commonplace but few of the things you adopt are really a part of you. You are not someone with a lot of focus -you are a dreamer and idealist even though you may seem a pessimist -you question things that you don't really care about but feel you should, you want people to be impressed with you but deep down you really just want someone who sticks by you and gets to know who you really are. You enjoy fantasy aspects of life and history because they appeal to your imagination and you often wish you could be the hero type in some story though you might claim you wish to be the honorable mage. You dislike the fact that you are young and do all you can to divert people from realizing it -you feel trapped and confined by the stereotypes given your age and you do your best to not get stuck in them. you are finding the process of the transition from youth to adult an annoying one and you keep looking for people to help inspire you rather than just associate with your peers.

Perhaps this is me. I see half of myself here, my core being somewhat different. Still denial and self image all play a part in things. I hope if the following is not my core and who I am inside, then I may evolve into this. I have faith that in time, who I am will become clear and settle as the excitement and bustle of youth ebbs into a more calm and clear perception of things.

You are one of the old souls, finding yourself often feeling misplaced in this world. You often question why you were born at this time rather than some part of history that appeals to your senses more. You are someone that thinks big because to think small is too confining for you and you like to dream of possibility if you must live in practicality. You are an extremely sensitive person, given to great acts of love and many struggles with emotional expression -you fear that your own hurts will indirectly hurt others and you have a hard time dealing with inflicting that kind of pain even at the cost of your own emotional well-being. You have an extreme sense of black comedy -that is the humerous in the bizarre and macabre. You delight in pointing out people's idiosynchrasies and you make sure to surround yourself with people that challenge your humor and intelligence. You are prone to bouts of self doubt and defeat but you always manage to come back to things. You are tired of going but you know that the only other option is to give up and you don't want to let anyone down. You are fiercely protective and proud of your friends and while you give your love sparingly to those that have truly earned it, when they have, they have earned your complete loyalty. You have a child's appreciation for many things perhaps because you understand that innocence makes things more appealing and oftentimes you wish you could go back to the point when responsibilities were few and magick with a ""k"" was still all around you."

Was in a car accident where Lexy totalled her car, we could have died, no one was hurt. First a rollover now this. Still Im unscathed, death comes and passes me by, so why am I here. I survive, what am I meant to be here for, if Im not meant to be dead? Why am I still standing here today, what purpose does this life of mine hold. I dream to speak. I pray to be heard.

I might get a job at New York Now, which would be a dream come true. Sometimes peple drift apart, and thats ok, it's just the changes in life. True colors always shine through in the end, as we realize harsh truths.

I might have to drop 4n6. I really don't want to but I have to in order to graduate. So Fordfest will be my last tournament. Original, I feel good about it. I only hope I do as well as I persoanlly, can. Thats all that I can really ask for. I have to take a math class, and hope to gradute, I can not repeat. I can't stand another year. Perhaps someday somewhere, I may be free, next year, is already just a dream. 

It's really strange what people will say when they think that you can't hear them. Such as when they think your listening to your CD player and you really arent. Like when Adam Bemis was behind me and talking about how I was so gay and wanted to do this and that to him and how much of a fag I was. Hate me, dislike me, think I'm going to hell? That's fine with me. Just don't make it an issue with me. I don't care what you think or feel about me as long as you don't make it a problem. I hate AB, people really need to grow up. The world is so much bigger than they are and they are liable to get swallowed up after high school. Grow up, it's really not that big of a deal. At least, it shouldnt be. All the things, in the end, don't really effect me, it's just another day, I'm stronger than all of this, and I always pull through. Try and stop me. I smile, and hope that you can to.

Broadway is dark tonight. All the lights are out as the waking wander the silent streets.

I may cry and I may die, but you will never change me. Someone call or IM me cuz I need it right now. KarmaxWhite is my SN. Thanks.

So much alwasy so much and so little. It all makes perfect confusion.

No one comments, no one ever does. 

I went to Brandonburg Park today at 11pm untill midnight at thought of jeff, wishing he was there to hold me as it hit me, how much I really do miss him. He's such a stranger now, doesnt have time to talk, always has something, another reason, another second, another step away.

Im so unhappy with myself right now. I gained another five pounds. 210pounds now. Almost back to 230. I try to get in shape and I gain weight, so stuck on myself. I can never get it right. Always praying for a miracle never to come.

I hate being someone I wish I wasnt in so many ways. I just cant be happy with myself. I wish I was someone else, could make a different life for myself. All the little imperfections that others may or may not notice or see as flaws loom over me. I hate my voice, my skin, I just dont know what to do, but I hate it all and I know I cant really change it and im so mad that I had to be born this way.

I suppose everyone is unhappy about themselves, but how does that help me.

I had a dreak of this beautiful angel who looked like me, but with beautiful ivory skin and blonde hair and clear blue eyes, beautiful body and hearbreaking smile, with these soft wings, he just faded away and I woke up crying and didnt even realize it. Something I wish to be, and fear never to find. What's the beauty inside of anyone worth if no one else can see it. How can anyone else hope to if I can't see it myself. No one cares enough to look for it.

What am I telling you for, you don't care. I bet no one even read this. Still, talking to myself is better than no one at all."

Happy New Year three and a half hours late. Once again behind the time, always a little to late, better here than never, I've got my won style. 

Sam, Sean, Diana, Mike, and Alexis, are the people I spent Ney Years with. Pizza and a movie. Last year feels so far away.

Edge of Seventeen plays in my head as I try to smile, but can only cry. You're not here with me, where are you my Angel, what does the New Year bring for you.

Many plans for today await, and I have no reason to look forward to any of them, always alone, I drag you along, Lexy goes with me, willing in her, so far away disposition, I know she loves me. To my mothers, have to fix the dvd player, and we hope for an excuse to go to Paneras, one more time, one more bite, one more sin for a new world.

Shopping to be done, gifts to be givin, clothes for a back a shirt worn thin, must find a way to grip this reality before it slips away.

Malchik Gey finds it's way to my brain as I sit, grasping for words which wont find way from mind to finger, silent as always, I scrape the last and place them here, hoping for inspiration in a world of cold nothing.

Wishing for a rising star, and angel within the darkness of demons.

New Book, starting to write soon, entitled Living A Lie. I shall post some of it, tell me what you think. My other book is alfway doen at 150pages. Rough draft, still lots of work to go, I don't know if I have it in me. These words run dry."

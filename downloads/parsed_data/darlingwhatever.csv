"event","I used to think that I wrote best when I was mad, but I just realized it's not that..It's that I feel best after writing when I'm mad, versus any other emotion. Do you understand? Because everything is so random--so sudden, and I never know what to do. And it seems everytime I think I have good judgment, I end up adding another mistake to the list. And I hate how I abuse the privelege to hate, because I've never met someone with as much resentment inside of them as I have. And I overuse the phrase ""I don't fucking give a shit""--because in all reality, I do. Sometimes I think I care too much, sometimes I give people too much credit, and I'm found corrupted by negativety, because it's your flaws that I hide behind. I'm not saying I'm perfect--I know that I am far from it. Because you know that when it comes to hit or miss, I'll be gone, because I'm too scared to take chances. I'm not afraid of failing, no..I'm used to failure..I just hate not succeeding. I'm not involved in anything because I know I don't have the will to make an effect, and compliments bring me down even more because I'm just that insecure. And I only feel complete when I'm all by myself, because that way, I know no one's judging me..at least not in front of my face. And even when I'm alone, it's a different kind of complete. I find myself peforming certain actions to fill the void--the emptiness, that lingers when it's quiet. And I could only pray that someday I will overcome my need to be independent, because actually, I am the exact opposite. I depend on too many people and too many things--this journal being one. I hate that whenever I have a bad day, I rant and rave in here, because I hate complaining. I hate the fact that most of those rant and raves have been deleted--only read by my eyes, because [as previously mentioned] ..I care too much. I hate that I can go from one emotion to the next in such a short period of time.. I feel fucking pathetic. And this journal entry reflects why.

"event","It is what it is, but it's also what you make it, and we made it exactly how Justin would have wanted us to. We shed our tears and said our goodbyes, but the majority of his wake consisted of smiling and laughing, due to reminiscing in rememberence of him. I wish I could say his wake was beautiful, but unfortunately, the cold body lying in the casket wasn't the real Justin, SSB, Buddy Bear, or whatever you may know him as. Reason being: he wasn't smiling. I swear to God I've never seen Justin not smiling, and that's what makes it the hardest..knowing we'll never be able to see that smile in person again. I can't describe the feeling I have inside.. Lately I've been made up of so many mixed emotions. I feel empty, sad, sympathetic--and then I feel hatred. I hate Justin's father and I hate God for doing this and I wish none of this would ever have happened. And I hate that I can't do anything about it, or comfort anyone, or help in any way at all. I feel useless. And I hate it.

Tonight after we left, I suggested we go to Picco's house, since they made him leave the wake. We forgot he didn't live on Columbia anymore, so we didn't get to do that. Instead we went back to Andy's house and reminisced some more. It felt good to talk to people who it seems I haven't talked to in ages. I miss the days when no one worried. I miss warm summer days and cool nights like tonight.  I hate this journal entry."

"event","They say you never know what you truly have, until it's taken away, and maybe that's right. But what's also true is that the worst things can happen to the best people.  Justin did not deserve any of this; from his addiction, to cancer, to death. He was always such a strong person, even with cancer he toughed it out. I remember when we found out he had Hotchins, Megan and I brought pizza and breadsticks to his house for him. His mother said he would like that as a tear rolled down her cheek. I'll never forget that night, walking through town, reminiscing with Justin. I'll never forget any other day or night or memory we shared. Everything lately has reminded me of  him. Tonight, when I went to Phil's house, we were making faces at each other and I told him I could do a smile that resembled the Grinch. I did it, and right then the time on the bus popped into my head, when I showed Chris and Justin my Grinch smile, and when Justin gave me that devilish, never to be forgotten, ear-to-ear grin. I cried because I knew I would never be able to see that smile in person again. On the way home tonigh, Hotel California by the Eagles came on the radio. My sister turned it up and we sang our hearts out, and halfway through I remembered the time at Alyssa's when Justin was sitting on the floor, playing that song for us on the guitar. I particularly fancied it, since it is my favorite Eagles song. I remember laughing with him as he attempted the solo, and I'd give anything to hear that laugh again, to see that huge grin, to be able to spend time with Justin and not have to worry. Friday night I saw him riding his bike in town, and I thought to myself how lucky he was to have caught the cancer so early, and be able to stop it from spreading. Little did I know, the next day he would be gone. I wish I could have stopped to say my last goodbye; or rather, to say Hello...Hello to a new life he will be able to live up in Heaven, free of pain and bad habbits. I speak on part of everyone who knew Justin--everyone who's heart Justin has touched--when I say he truly was a remarkable person. He definately will never be forgotten.

and of course, i must mention how amazingly well the Eagles concert turned out. because it RAWKED. and with the help of my abilities to ignore dumb ho's, the [evil] stepmom didn't get on my nerves too terribly bad. plus they closed with Desperado, equalling an approximate 6.5 boners for ali.

with this being said, my birthday was quite thee success. i recieved many homemade cards that made me smile, the new fall out boy cd from cor dawg, bubba from jake, sweat pea bubble bath, $$$, and some more oodles. a special thanks to everyone's contribution to making it a pleasurable day, even a simple ""happy birthday"" made me feel special. i was quite surprised.

i found out that i'm going to go to princeton to pick out my car soon, but my dad & cathy are convinced i'm getting a grand am. i don't really mind, i'm just gonna trash it to get on Pimp My Ride anyways..cos that's the real spirit.

it's 1:30 AM and i have muchos assingmentos to do, and another bubble bath to take, annnndddddd laundry to do..so i bid you farewell. i must remember gobstoppers for jake tomorrow..[happy birthday gay man]."

Sometimes you have to think, <b>Is it really worth it?</b> It scares me, I don't think I'll ever know the answer.  I don't think I'll ever have you figured out, but you..You know everything to say and do to get me. And I hate it. I don't know how you have such control over me, and I could never figure it out.  You are so conning, you persuade me to think that you really are in love, then reality sets in and I can't help to wonder if the feelings you are trying to portray are really true. You have a way with words like no other, and sometimes, I don't know the meaning behind what you're saying. Is it honestly worth the pain we create for each other? You're so wrapped up in having this perfect image of me in your head, that you can't see the real me. The truth is..I used to be so afraid of losing you that I would hold back, for fear you might lose interest. Lately it's been just the opposite, and I find myself saying things that I never thought I would. I act like I don't care, but I swear I do. I'm pretty sure I do. I just wish I could say I was happy. I wish I could pretend, like you. You're so good at pretending everything's okay. I wish i had that capability.."

It's only quarter to 4, which almost marks the 12 hours I've been awake.  Today I slept like a shithead with mono and felt good about myself.  I got in a fight with my boyfriend because I'm lazy like that.  Would you know there is a deerhead in this room that I am allergic too?  Every time I come in here I sneeze and it's annoying.  I discovered today that my basement smells like basement, and it is precisely only 4 feet underground. Amazing. I'm taller than my basement.  I have yet to go public with my online journal(s) due to the simple fact that a journal is a journal and for nobody's eyes but mine.  The gamma radiation is a high-energy electromagnetic radiation that originates in the nucleus. You have to watch out for the discrete bundles of energy waves as well as alpha particle decay. I just wish the isomeric transition occurred immediately after particle emission. For now I'll just use duct tape.

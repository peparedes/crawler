"event","All of you who know me really really well <lj user=poeticinsominac> the rest of you know who you are. Know why I am so happy about this one thing. The best part is it is helping me turn my world right side up again. I decided to stop questioning people and their motives for doing things. If I don't it will probably only lead to my destruction. Anyways enough of that. <lj user=poeticinsominac> I really must thank you for helping me out with school. I swear at times I just want to tell Ms. what I really think of her. I don't know what I would do without you. On the bright side I might get my own place really really soon. And that is cool we are just working things out, you know she has to find sometime that we can get what needs to be done done (with out upsetting my schedule). Spot was happy to see me when I returned. He barked and barked and barked some more and refused to leave my side. (So cute) So I played with him, rubbed his tummy and patted his head you know the good stuff. I love the little guy he is my angel. My sister is also happy to have me back even thought she would never admit to it in a million years. And the happy that just makes me break out in a big smile and makes me feel free like a giant wait has been lifted of me. (Picture me under a boulder with my arms and legs sticking out from underneath with the words great just fucking great what next? In a bubble.) Even when I am having a super horrible day I smile. I have been found yeah!!!"

"event","<b>Why Lies?</b>

Why why why do people always feel the need to lie to you about what you probably already know. Hmm Why not just tell the truth it would be a lot simpler. A. You would not have to think up a really good story to tell the other person and then try to remember what you told them so they don't story check you and find out that you lied. Once they find out that you did infact lie to them they will never believe another word that comes out of your mouth. If everyone were just honest with everyone else everyone weather they liked you are not they would at least be able to get along better in their day to day lives.
Case in point. I am working in and office with you and you want to leave for whatever reason( off gallivanting with friends on company time for pretty much your entire shift.) Sure what ever it is your neck.  Lets say my name is Amy instead of saying Amy I have to go to the powder room which is such a lie. I know when I am being lied to and I hate it with a passion. I don't care where you have to go or what you have to do all I care about is that you don't try to bring me down with you when your going down because it was your <b>fault.</b><b> If you try to implicate me in anyway I will CUT YOU.</b>"

"event","Hmmmm were do I even begin.  Friend who is deserving of that title hmm? When you think of the word friend what pops into your mind.  I'll tell you what I think.  I think  a friend is someone who you hang out with do things with back up if needed.  A friend is someone who you know will be with you through the good time and the not so good times.  A friend is someone you trust with your secrets as well as the events of your day.  Friends are not people who never call or only call when they need something.  Friends are not people who have had your number for the longest time(<b>since the dawn of time</b>) and never even called to see if you were <b>alive</b> or weather you <b>kicked the bucket.</b>  Friends are not people who would try to turn the world against you just because you happen to be a better person(decent) then them.  Friends are not people who change their number and not give it to you,(<b>you know who u are</b>) but complain about how they can never reach you and why you don't want to hang with them anymore. Friends are not people who claim to have lost your number that is why they never call you.<b> Friends are people who you care about and who care about you.</b>  Friends are people who have always got your back and you theirs. Friends are people who like you for you.  <b>A word of advise to all</b> if people want you to change who you are for them then they are not your friends they are just using you until the next sucker comes along.  Then they will kick you to the cirb like yesterdays news."

<P><FONT size=5>Why can't they just live by the old saying do on to others as you would have done on to you.&nbsp; I mean is it really so hard? If you really sit down and think about it there is no need to lie,cheat,steal,kill etc.&nbsp; Life in actually quite simple it is just that people make bad choice that usually come back to bite them in the ass thus making life seem hard.&nbsp; I could understand if your were dirt poor and could not find a job so you had to steal to help out the family fine.&nbsp; But to have the resources at your finger tips and not use them but continue to bitch about what you don't have.&nbsp; Who's fault is that huh? (yours) if you really wanted what the jones across the street have there is a simple way to get it HARD WORK. That way at the end of the day you can hold your head high and be proud of your sucess not be constantly looking over your back woundering when the cops will catch up with you and what story u will have to come up with when they do.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=5>You no the kind of people I HATE with a passion? it is those kinds YES YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE they pretend to be your friends they PRETEND to care so they can just TAKE TAKE TAKE their disgusting.&nbsp; They say things like I don't play games, I treat everyone equally. FUCKING LIEING 2 FACED SONS OF BITCHES.&nbsp; Why waste my Fucking time huh? That time I wasted on your sorry ass is time that i'm never going to get back.&nbsp; Had I know I would have used that time to do something worthwhile(continuing to better ones self.)&nbsp; Why must the slime of the world always try to SCREW over the good people of the world? Lonely? There's a reason for that no one wants to spend their time with a LOSER/USER people want people who are going to respect them and appreciate all that they have to offer.&nbsp; NOT TAKE TAKE TAKE&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank goodness for the close nit group of friends I have, they keep me saine. <FONT color=#ff0000>YOU </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>GUYS ROCK!!!</FONT></FONT></P>"

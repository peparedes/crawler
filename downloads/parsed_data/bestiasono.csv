And there's no way to just save them, at least that I've found.  I just have to hope they figure out which side of the water's surface they're on. I pray that if I ever start to drown out of reality, I'll be smart enough to let others pull me up.

...currently watching a bad relationship from afar.  Watching someone act in complete blind ignorance of himself, yelling to the world to change to conform to the ideals he can't even come close to (but thinks himself a paragon of), and watching the girl he's dragging along with him slip away.  I guess it could be a phase.  But it's two personalities that are so horrifically toxic to each other... one that desperately wants a cause to champion and a flag to die for, so desperately that he's allying himself with a cause he knows nothing about.  And it would be good cause, except that he sounds like a strawman version of it.  And his friends slip away, muttering, unable to get across to him the disaster he's running into, as any action he doesn't deem supportive of his current goals is a betrayal and worthy of yelling and screaming.  And her?  She so wants to follow him that she's being subsumed by him, completely.  Words from her mouth are now clearly his, or at least an approximation thereof, in direct opposition to her earlier thoughts.  In conversation she backs him unthinkingly, sometimes so unthinkingly that it becomes obvious she has no idea what he's saying and is instead just trying to support an opinion as close to his as she can.  That's okay, he's not listening to her enough to notice.  So she just keeps trying to parrot his thoughts as best as she can.  Looks more like stockholms than a relationship.

"event","Grr, Livejournal is for overdramatic ranting, right?   Good.  Ranting vent incoming, ignore if you're not in the mood.

Been feeling lately that the people who are physically close to me of late (that is to say, folks I actually see on a day to day basis) have absolutely no idea who I am, and frankly just aren't the sort of people I actually want to talk to about anything serious or interesting, with the one exception of Rita.  Today was... a rather strong affirmation of that fact.  

I was in the living room with some folks that need not be named, and one of them made the claim that evolution doesn't effect humans.  This is a somewhat common statement made by people who have absolutely no idea what evolution is.  So I tried to stop him and make the point that no, evolution is just a fact of life and doesn't turn off in modern society any more than gravity turns off when you step into a 747... it just has different effects.  I tried using the example of hormones effecting sex drive... even with modern medicine fixing otherwise lethal condition, the genetics that effect hormone production can increase or decrease your likelihood of having sex, thus increasing the chance of reproduction.  I got the response that hormones don't effect sex drive (or at least do so little that their effect is not significant compared to cultural effects on sex drive).  I was a little blown away, but more so by the fact that <i>no one in the room disagreed with this statement, despite the person making it and three others in the room being in the mental health profession... and one of those people backed the statement up</i>.  I'm used to hearing a dumb statement once in a while, but that was over the top.  Trying to prove this I brought up a girl in the room (who is a very clear counter example to the concept, due to her massive sex drive changes when she goes on and off birth control) and menopause... she was ignored when she verified this, and menopausal sex drive changes were dismissed as being more cultural than hormonal.  

I tried clarifying to see if I'd somehow misinterpreted this idea, but no, that's exactly what this guy was claiming.  Furthermore, here was a (caucasian) guy I'd heard ranting about how most white men don't realize how privileged they are and how they tend to ignore the opinions of women, and he was going off about how all menopausal women who say hormone changes effect their sex drives are wrong and he's right, and ignoring the girl in the room stating clearly that he was wrong despite her being an exact counterexample.  The guy also claimed that lab rats being given hormones and having changes to their sex drive was probably environmental, even if they were in the same lab.  Hypocrisy and stupidity all in one, but to cap this off the response from one of my housemates was ""just give up dude, Noah's too stubborn and will never change his mind about anything.""  Yes, that housemate is also in the mental health profession.  Note that this point all I was doing was trying to be sure I understood what he was saying... I could barely counter it.

So why am I so pissed?  Okay, having someone ranting that foolishly is upsetting, but having my housemates back him up (and only one person ever contradicting him) on this doesn't make me feel any better about the intelligence level of the people I regularly talk to.  And getting dismissed as ""Noah's always argumentative"" or ""Noah never changes his mind and is just trolling"" (which has been coming up lately in every debate) on a regular basis is getting extremely aggravating.  No, I have not been ""trolling"" or ""being argumentative"" but I have disagreed when people state absolutely stupid things (recent examples also included my disagreeing that a medieval city about to get invaded counts as being ""not urgently in danger"" and that anyone posting a contrary opinion on a message board must necessarily be trolling).  And I like debate.  Real debate.  I need it in my life.  I need people to bounce ideas against, people who can point to holes in an argument or make actually decent points of their own... but god damn, realizing the folks I have to talk to are completely incapable of this (and quite certain they're amazing) is aggravating.  Perhaps I am getting less of a patience for fools.  Perhaps it's that I've always hated willful ignorance and hypocrisy. 

And no, I'm definitely not referring to anyone who would be reading this.  I mostly just needed to vent somewhere away from anyone I might be talking about.  Yay emojournal.  Let me know if I'm being stupid."

Also, they only had three conduits for four snakes (massive groupings of cable, in this case each snake had 32 pairs of cables), so we had to split one snake into three parts and rebuild it.

"event","So, for those who haven't heard me babbling about it for the last year, I'm currently choreographing a massive (15 person) fire dance.  It's a war dance, originally inspired by the Maori Haka, with extra inspiration from Escrima, stage combat, indonesian dance, and a variety of other styles.  It's got 12 people with twin fire machetes and three staff dancers, and it's been a dream of mine for a while.

Overall, it's going great.  The dancers look absolutely incredible when they get it right (we're still practicing and have a while before we're done, but they're getting noticeably better with every run through), the energy is awesome, and the dance looks about ten steps above the usual fire conclave material.  It's pretty mind blowing.

But at the same time, I'm still having to deal with the head of fire conclave.  She was recently close to dropping out due to other commitments so I ended up taking on the role of co-shin... which in theory means we have the same job.  However, she has incredibly authority issues (namely, she must be the authority) and has a very odd sense of how fire dance should be.  Specifically, she wants to be extremely girly, with all emphasis being on hip wiggling (and not the fire toys themselves).  Now, this wouldn't be too bad except for the fact that she then tries to force this on everyone else.  Last year she wanted us to all be dressed as sexy cheerleaders, and the year before that it was, I shit you not, ""pretty bugs.""  Last year everyone had to be part of a cheerleader number no matter what.  Strangely, none of the guys except me seem to want to come back each year, and the only girls that come back are, well, as girly as they come.  Now, I'm not saying that girly hip wiggly dance is a bad thing, but forcing it on everyone is getting a bit much... not to mention she brings the same thing every single time.  Watching what she'd done for this year was, well, exactly like watching last year, to the point that I saw absolutely all of the same dance moves.

So, why am I bitching about it this time?  Well, I'd been informed that the plan this year was to wear very little.  This seemed great to me... you can be revealing and sexy, or you can be strong and wearing little.  It works for anything.  So I told my dancers we were going to go with dark single color costumes, contrasting against our skin (for example, I'm wearing black shorts and sharp black body paint).  I figure, this will fit the piece nicely and be very visible at long range (since you've got a lot of fire right in front of your body, so the contrasting look shows very well).  At the full cast rehearsal, our shin says she's going to decide on costumes soon, so I talk to her privately and mention what we're currently doing.  She says ""oh, I wanted us to all be bright green, so it shows well!""  Well of course, bright green creates no contrast at all, it just shows the whole body, and for those of us who are colorblind, it doesn't show up at all.  Also, bright green isn't exactly war dance material.  So I mention my concerns on that, and she says ""well, I wanted earth tones, because it's evolution themed.""  Seeing an obvious compromise, I suggest we go with earth tones, and my piece will be dark browns, blacks, natural leather, and deep forest greens contrasted against skin, while hers can be bright green.  Her response?  ""Okay, so we're agreed.  Green, so we can be bright.""  

Yeah.  Good job sounding like you were listening.  Grrrr.  Oh, and she was talking about a giant banner that says LOVE over us, due to the fact that love is the final evolution.  Luckily I don't think anyone wants to build that.  Besides, my solution there was that if she puts up the banner, I fling Carrie with a pair of lit swords at the banner.  That should solve things. Oh well.  Bitch bitch moan."

Actually, I think I've done my good deeds for the year in about a week, so go me.

So yeah, should be a lot of fun.  I'm still trying to get more dancers (the more the merrier for something like this) but it looks like I'll actually be able to do it, and that's awesome!  If anyone knows other fire dancers who would like to join in, I can train them in the sword part even if they haven't used fire swords before.

If you could make such stilts that could retract up the side of your leg and then spring back out into position, it would be REALLY AWESOME.  It should be noted that not only can you jump really high in these, you can also run really fast... an average person can run as fast as an olympic athelete with these things.

And that got me thinking... it would be possible to make a suit that, 20 years ago, would complete qualify as a super hero suit.  Retractable jumping stilts for speed and jump height, cooling aparatus on the neck, wrist, and inner thigh (tests have shown that cooling the blood actually gives you far better endurance... most exhaustion is just overheating), wrist mounted tasers, thermographic goggles... all of this is actually possible with today's technology.

It's adorable, and their coloration makes them look a bit like a yin yang symbol made entirely of fuzz and cute.  The various housemates are all studying and writing away in the living room as finals approach.  Outside, the yard slowly shifts from red to blue to gold, and the chickens have lain down for the night.  The house is still completely full of pie, and slowly we're managing to clean up.  It's all very peaceful.

Of course, last night was a massive and wonderfully successful party (thanks to all who came!).  Hordes of pies showed up, filling three tables (one of which was actually full of stacks of pies).  And with those hordes of pies came hordes of people, resulting in much chatting and playing about and plenty of storytelling and rediculous jokes (is every joke with a horse in it horrible?).  When the first wave left, there was suddenly room for a dance party... whee!  And my jelloshot pie is finally becoming something worth eating (but the crust needs improvement still).

I mean, it's nothing impressive, but it's fun.  I also sorta had my first paid job helping with modeling and, *ahem* rigging, I guess?  Except that it was paid in dinner.  But I'll claim it.  We're getting two eggs a day from the chickens, which is enough for regular snacks, and there's been about the right amount of regular house events... enough to feel properly socialized, but not enough to never be able to be flexible.  And tomorrow a few of us will be playing board games and hanging about with 16 pounds of bacon, a pound of strawberries, a few quarts of ice cream, and some heart medication on the side.

"event","So, I'm up in Portland.  Yesterday was spent preparing for and then enjoying the Portland burner party, which I actually ended up spending two days working on (someone needed to set up the lights, and one thing lead to another...).  It was a fun party all in all, but with all that work on it I was pretty tired by the time it started.  Still, good times, and I'm getting to see Lee a bit.  Rin won't come down, sadly.

I'm missing Rita something fierce though.  That does tend to happen when I'm away for more than perhaps 4 days or so.  Sad.
 
Meanwhile, Craig's List is being REALLY annoying.  They've implimented something saying I have to get phone confirmation to post in their rideshare section, but clicking on that just sends me either to pages not found or to their Terms of Service and never actually gets anywhere, so I can't put up ads to get riders for the way back down.  Very annoying.  Also, I just got a ""hippier than thou"" response... I managed to get up an ad a few days ago, before the change, stating that I had a 6 seater truck headed down from Eugene to Santa Cruz and would like to save money on gas by picking up a few riders, and that I was towing a trailer so I had plenty of room.  I got a response from someone saying ""my god, 6 seats?  That thing must use up so much gas!  How much does it cost?""  So I told him $30 for gas if I got 4 riders, $40 if I got less than that, and he responds with a mini diatribe about how I should get a smaller car and it's too bad they don't make cars small here like they do in Europe.  Gee, thanks random stranger, I'll make sure to bring a Prius up here next time I want to tow a trailer from Eugene to Santa Cruz over two mountain passes.  I'm sure that will work well.  I sure am glad you've decided you know my situation enough to tell me what kind of car I can buy, knowing only that I'm towing a trailer.  Yeesh.  At least I've got one rider so far.

But man, I'm tired, and need to find more things to do in Portland while Lee's at work.  Reading American Gods is nice, but I can't do it all day.

Oh, and meanwhile I've got a 3-4 day gig in Oakland from the 20th-24th... is there anyone in that area who wouldn't mind a couch surfing visitor during that period?"

"event","Okay, first of all, yes I'm glad Obama won.  At the same time, I'm already pissed off at him.

See, he does this MTV thing where he answers questions, and one was about prop 8.  Here's his answer:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcSdwF39e-Q

It should be noted here: he's against gay marriage, but thinks civil unions are good enough, and argues against Prop 8 on the (reasonable) grounds that constitutions shouldn't remove rights.  Okay, seriously.  Mr. Obama, you're the son of an interracial marriage and you're talking about how the government should not let people actually get married if they have a marriage that the government doesn't approve of?  Really?  And more to the point, your position on civil unions being good enough... that's been brought up before.  Only last time, I'm pretty sure they called it ""Separate But Equal.""  And you just argued for it.  Brilliant.  For the record, no, they're not equal.  Depending on the state you're in, that Civil Union may mean absolutely nothing, and you may find yourself unable to visit your partner of who knows how many years who's in the hospital because you're not actually married and civil unions don't count there.

So yeah, the day an educated liberal black man who's about to become president stands up in favor of a reflavored separate but equal is a sad day indeed.

Meanwhile, if Obama had answered that question with something more definitive (something that doesn't come off as ""fuck gay people, but I'm against it on a technicality) his influence might have been enough to swing this one and kill it, at least for another few years.  And he clearly had the election anyway.  So, his first act hurts... and it hurts really bad.

But what does it mean, since Prop 8 passed?  Well, it's in the constitution... California now has, buried in the basic rights of our state, ""Fuck you, gay people.""  Charming.  And since this is a very liberal state, this is going to spread... if it can pass here, it can pass anywhere.  Which means this wasn't just about California, it was about absolutely everywhere.  And the only defense?  The US Supreme Court, who could theoretically hand down another Brown v Board of Education and enforce equal rights, or take the first amendment route and say that since marriage is inherently religious (proved by the arguements against Prop 8) the government needs to get out of the business entirely, and make Civil Unions for everyone.  Personally, I favor the latter, as it would get this crap done with permanently.

But for that to happen, we'd need a different SCOTUS.  The current one is massively conservative and would likely not even hear any case, calling it states' rights or something to get out of dealing with it.  Though why conservatives think government belongs in bedrooms is beyond me.  So, we'd need Obama to put in people who are open to gay marriage... but he's just stated he's against gay marriage, and having such an opinion these days would make appointing someone really hard.  Which makes this all very unlikely.

So, we had one major civil rights victory as a black man took office, but one hell of a civil rights kick in the nuts at the same time.

Here's me being VERY unhappy about that."

"event","First off, I'm working a show downtown.  It's the Senior Center's big musical review... basically a bunch of musical numbers by a 55+ cast, and it's actually pretty damn fun.  Also, I can get people in to see it for free, if folks are interested.  Shows are Friday at 1pm, Friday at 7:30pm, and Saturday at 1pm, and it's at the Santa Cruz Civic.  Call me on my cell phone within 1 hour before and I'll get you in.  

Second off... man this has been fun.  For years now I've been feeling like I should have been in charge of audio on this thing, because I was doing most of the work anyway and I really thought I could run the sound board better.  Anyway, this year I finally got the chance (the usual guy is out due to injury).  So, I was working on it, and things went smoothly during set up, and then we had some issues during tech with mics not working.  I tried to rent more gear from Santa Cruz Sound, but they said they didn't have any available and besides, it's impossible to run more than two mikes off the system I had anyway because there's too much interference on the necessary frequencies in downtown Santa Cruz... simply can't be done they said.  Plus, I was missing half the antennas (two of four), and each antenna needs 4 rods of the right size... there were only 6 rods for the two antennas I had, plus two extra rods that were the wrong type (they're designed for higher frequency).  Meanwhile, I had about 20 minutes to actually fix everything.

...and the show went off without a hitch, including running 5 mikes off the system that's supposedly impossible to get more than 2 off of, and I even had two functional backup mikes.  That's some serious jury rigging and Macgiver system fixing, and it came out great.  And after all this, I hear some old lady after the show.  Evidently her friend was saying the singers sounded so wonderful and clear this year, so incredibly crisp and audible... she was sure that all the singers must have improved tremendously for some reason, despite no change for the last 5 years.  And she said no, that's rediculous, clearly the bought a brand new sound system and that's why it was so good.  And here's me, quietly listening, knowing that the singers are the same as last year and the sound system is the same one, only due to poor maintainance it's actually worse.  The only change was I took over that board.  :)

Also, I was interupted during the show by a few people to tell me that the sound was really great.  That doesn't normally happen.  I was really pleased.  Plus, the director was complaining how lame it was that it was impossible to hear yourself on stage before I had things set up.  I looked at her dumbfounded... turns out the old guy had told them that moniters couldn't be used to send back the voices of the singers.  I tried as politically as possible to explain that I could make that happen for her, trying REALLY hard not to insult the hell out of him in the process.  I mean seriously people, that's sound engineer 101... make the damn singers hear what they want to hear onstage.  And yes, now they can all hear themselves and get custom moniter mixes so they hear at whatever volume they prefer.  I also had the video people ask if it was possible to get a different sort of mix just for them... my job steward was trying to tell them that was too much work, but by the time he finished explaining this I had it set up for them.  Even had time to take pictures from my booth for one of the dancers.

So yeah, I'm feeling especially competant right now.  And today the director for next year came up to ask how she could make certain she got me back for next year... evidently my third week in September is now booked.  And this concludes my ego boosting period for the day.  Yay!"

I have to admit, the chicks are pretty cute.  Cuter still, however, is Rita sitting there intently staring at them to see if they'll go into the new duplex addition to their cardboard coup that she just added.  She stares... they cheap.  And eat.  And poop.  And she continues to watch.  I think  it's been about two hours now.  She's just hunched over watching them in their little cardboard world of poop and food, seeing if they'll do something new.  They don't, by the way.  They're very dumb birds if you ask me.

Meanwhile, Burning Man approaches ever closer.  I'm stressed about it because I'm working a ton, and still have to complete the shade structure and get the trampoline functional.  At least the booze I made for the event is working out relatively well, though it turns out you can't fit nearly as much sugar into 151 as I thought you could.  No matter.  Still, it's stressful working out transportation and shelter.  I have to make sure I'm awake when I arrive, after all.  

Work is, well, plentiful at the moment.  I recently set up a Boeing expo where they showed off all the expensive new toys they want to sell to the military.  I'm not sure I'm supposed to say what exactly they were working on (no non citizens were allowed in the room, for example) but at least it was nice to see some technologies that would be very handy for civilians in the long run.  I'm less worried about military spending when there's a clear long term benefit beyond blowing up people who look different.  Also, they gave me a nifty hat.

I've realized I'm very backwards about a lot of things.  At work, jobs where I just sit there and get paid to do nothing but look useful are absolute hell to me, while most folks seem to love those.  Meanwhile, I absolutely love crawling through tight spaces up high while working at double speed.  Luckily, my coworkers have figured this out, and now offer to trade jobs with me a lot... last time I was watching a genie lift to make sure it didn't suddenly fall over.  I was, suffice to say, bored out of my mind.  A friend of mine (the Buisiness Agent, in fact) offered to trade me... I go climb around on a dangerous section of floating truss and focus lights, while he takes my ""stand there"" job.  I thanked him for it, though it was weird to think that most people there would consider that a bad trade on my part.  How odd.  Also, caffine making me pass out is really weird.  

I've also realized something else at work lately... I hate doing stuff wrong.  I don't mean I hate messing up, I mean doing stuff where someone tells me ""do it this way"" and I know the way of doing it is stupid.  As an example, Tricord (a local tradeshow company) has a bunch of tables... hundreds per convention.  And they put out these tables, and then you have to staple vinyl on the top of these tables, and then staple skirts around these tables, a process taking about 2-3 minutes per table.  So, that's a freaking long time and tons of man-hours.  And then at the end you rip out the vinyl and skirts, but the staples are still there, some sticking out and stabbing people.  ARG!  I hated that.  Plus, you throw out all the vinyl after every show, very wasteful.  Then I did this Boeing gig, and they had fitted table skirts that you just put on the table in one shot, which were washable so you didn't throw them out afterwords.  15 seconds per table, max, and no stabbing.  I like the no stabbing.  And you know, suddenly I didn't hate setting up these tables!

And then there's the recent realization that I'm actually phobic of relationship talks.  I mean seriously... sick to my stomache, scared beyond reason.  Lord knows I know why, but I don't like it, especially since I'm dating a girl who makes the whole fear absolutely stupid.  I mean, the majority of our relationship talks have been like this:

Me:  So, I'm feeling like this.
Rita:  Me too.
Me:  Wait, really?
Rita:  Yeah.
Me:  ...okay, let's get some ice cream.
Rita:  *cute noise*

So, I dunno.  I want to get the hell over that.  Rita's not going to, well, to be like someone else, and my fear is totally unjustified with her, and yet I can't seem to shake it... I seriously start sweating at the thought of discussing the relationship at all.

In a completely unrelated note, Danae showed up at a party I was at recently.  The nausea mostly passed when I managed to ignore her presence, which took about 30 minutes.  It's been, what, 3 years now?  I hate that she has any effect on me at all anymore.  Meanwhile, I've heard she's not really ever going to work for the 16 anymore (I wonder if she realizes that... they don't look kindly on folks who get injured).  We'll see, but perhaps I'll start calling in to that union again.  Lord knows I don't want to end up on a call with her.

Oh!  But good news... they made me the A1 for the Senior Follies, which is a fun show and a yearly event (meaning if I do a good job, the job is probably mine from now on).  And I like those guys, so it's good to work for them."

All my free days have gone into construction (two days of building the structure, 1 day working on the chicken coup and the plum drink I'm creating).  The structure, by the way, is going to look like this: http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3097/2630602404_771ae64027.jpg

Speaking of the drink, does anyone have a good idea for what to name the new drink?  It's a tinture of cider spices (cardamom, cinamon, orange zest, etc) with sugar and plums, and it's mostly 151 for the alcohol.  Potent as heck, sweet, fruity, and with a holiday set of flavors.  Any ideas?

And other news... facebook is scary.  People popping up and friending me that I haven't seen in years, and a few I don't even remember.  It would be nice if the darn program would stop suggesting I friend Danae though.  Also, I was hoping I could find my cousin through it (since it found nearly everyone else) but no dice.  If I was actually clear on her name it would help (it was Maggie Beams or Maggie Beems, but she may have married... dunno).  

Oh, and if anyone gets a call from an official sounding person checking if I'm a terrorist or something, don't be alarmed, but it's for real so no joking around with them!  I'm working somewhere that will require some clearance.

Meanwhile, I'm going to try to make it to the circus class tomorrow.  Rita just got a unicycle and plans to try it out.  And of course I'll be teaching stilts to anyone who comes.

"event","I don't remember much of it, but I was running around on an island through a village, basically as though I was playing Team Fortress or one of those games (complete with guns that floated above the surface that you ran over to pick up.  The terrain was vaguely reminiscent of Diablo II Act III.  The villagers, mostly generic bad guys with guns, were evil things that you shot... just a standard video game.  Then I entered one house.  Two children in the house ran behind something, and then I heard a huge sound as something big was coming from another room.  I ran back outside because it was clearly a boss fight.  A huge thing came out.  It was rectangular, like a walking monolith with arms and legs, and it had three small sections running up its face like buttons on a shirt (except much larger than that.  The top one was shooting rockets at me, and I knew you had to shoot that section to damage it, and then the next section, and then the next, so I was shooting my twin submachine guns and bouncing around while firing.

Then suddenly the three sections turned into video screens and I could see the images of the faces of the two children I'd just seen.  That's weird, I thought.  And suddenly I was getting a cut scene plot, about how this strange thing had arrived on this island many years ago and found old machines on the island, which looked like audio rack devices (CD players, compressors, etc).  It was narrating in my head, about how these little primitive machines that were just sort of lying there wanted to be human, and so it had modified them and modified them until they were the villagers I had seen.  I was thinking how this was a very strange plot development.  The monolith creature certainly didn't seem evil.

Then two people were being introduced to each other.  One had a funny hippie name that I remembered when I started this post but have forgotten already, and looked very much like a burner on the playa.  The other was introduced as Karapheobus.  I think we were on a dock or something.

Anyway, that name stuck in my head.  What an interesting name.  My subconcious is strange."

"event","So, I've been working like crazy on this plan for a shade structure for Burning Man this year... now I have to show it off.

30'X34' of nice, cool shade in a structure that should be durable enough that I don't have to worry about it at all.  Good times.  More pictures can be found on my flickr account... and yeah, that's a 3D model.  The current plan can hold up to three domes and 6 tents while still having a 20'X16' common area.  By comparison, the old structure had 12'X20' total room, much of which was taken up by tents.  

So, yeah, I'm proud of my little project.  And nervous that it might explode the first day out there."

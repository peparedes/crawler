"event","I want to start off by saying that my heart goes out to the family and friends of the victims of the ""Massacre at Virginia"".

I was at home that&nbsp;afternoon and I happened to be watching the Young and the Restless and I saw the&nbsp;countdown clock that pops up when there is news about to interrupt&nbsp;the show.&nbsp; I thought to myself great, what happened now.&nbsp; The reported said ""At least 20 people have been killed, please stay tuned as we will continue to keep you posted"".&nbsp; I continue to watch the The Bold and the Beautiful and the countdown clock pops up again and this time she says, ""at least 30 people have been killed"", she tell me again to say tuned as she will continue to keep me posted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The next day&nbsp; you turned on the television and you see that just about every morning show have decided to set camp on the campus of Virginia Tech.&nbsp; The competition begins, who can interview the most people, or who can interview the most important person.&nbsp; You are told time and time again that they are the most reliable source, that you heard it here first and so on and so forth.&nbsp; They all ask the same questions time and time again, what can we do to say our children, what was going to the mind of that student?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When I first tuned in I was not moved.&nbsp; Everyday we ear that hundred of soldiers dieing &nbsp;over seas, not counting the number of innocent people that were killed that day as well.&nbsp; Over the period of the last 8 years, we have seen different school shootings, and the country mourns, for a week and two and we are on to the next big story.&nbsp; I was not moved at first because this has become a numbers game.&nbsp; As if they are saying the more people die the more tragic the event becomes.&nbsp; I started to feel a connection with the victims, when it is made known that these were actual humans.&nbsp; The&nbsp;numbers became names and stories of actual people.&nbsp; I started to think that what if one person was hurt, it would have not made such an impact and that is what is sad.&nbsp; It just seems to me that people have stop caring to the victims, but have begin to care about the story.&nbsp; There are about 11 people that survived and they are barely talked about, no they didn't die, but for the rest of their lives they have to think about that day.

Everyday there is a family sitting at home, hoping that today is not the day they there son or daughter or husband or&nbsp; wife or brother or sister, is not the one that was killed today.&nbsp; The families of the victims of any tragedy are always in remembrance of what occurred and I feel that at time the media at times is&nbsp;not sensitive of the mourners.

Its also sad when a tragedy is given a name, &nbsp;the Massacre&nbsp;at Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Another sad truth to this is that in a few weeks, it will no longer be in the news, while the Anna Nicole Smith death and battles are still being reported, months after her death.

Again my heart and my prayers are with all the victims of this tragic event.&nbsp; I pray that the Lord, our God keeps you all, in Jesus name, I pray,&nbsp; Amen."

"event","Are you serious?&nbsp; A man was fired for the way that he called a women's basketball team ""nappy-headed hos"".&nbsp; Surprise, surprise of course he wasn't going to get away with it, he is after all in technical terms a white man .&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no may to really say how this would of been handled if he was a black man, but I think that he might of gotten suspended and have to make a public apology but being fired would of never happened.&nbsp; The things that people of color say about their own race and white people is a lot worse.&nbsp; This whole situation just goes to prove that race is a big issue in this country.&nbsp; Do you think that it would of been different if her just said hos instead?&nbsp; I think so, he probably would not have to apologize.&nbsp; 

I am not saying that Imus was justified for saying what he said, he was wrong, and so would anyone else, no matter what race.&nbsp; I believe that the man should of not been fired.&nbsp; I keep trying to put myself in the women's shoes, would I feel differently if he said that to me personally?&nbsp; Would I want him to lose his job?&nbsp; How long would I be upset?&nbsp; I know that I would be embarrassed because know I am know as a ""nappy head ho"".&nbsp; 

The true is that people say worst to friends and are never penalized for it, in fact it is followed by a laugh, yeah funny, ha ha ha.&nbsp; Why does it make it better when a woman calls another woman a B**** and depending on who calls you that, its fine.&nbsp; It means the same thing every time it is said, so why when said by someone outside the click its okay?&nbsp; 

Better yet the, N word, its okay for a black or hispanic person to use to call another black&nbsp; person but wrong when a white person uses it.&nbsp; It took for me to get to college to learn the reason behind that and it was not a good reason.&nbsp; I was told that when a black person says it, they are taking the negative aspect of the word and giving it a positive meaning, or something along those lines.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is that positive meaning?&nbsp; Anyone please feel free to answer that for me.... 

When Micheal Richards repeatedly said the N word, many people of color decided to make a movement to get other people of color to stop using that word.&nbsp; Their argument was how can you really get mad at anyone saying it when you say it yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Weeks later, they are back at using it again, now that this incident has risen up, people of color have become defensive again. 

By every definition of the American Race Placement system, I am considered to be black, not African American, but black.&nbsp; So when I fill in the job application, they let me know that it is my choice to fill that portion out if I want to, that it would not affect me in any way, I fill in Black/African American.&nbsp; The reason for that would be because I seem to get an interview when I do fill that portion out, as if I have met the quota, lol.&nbsp; This tells me that it doesn't really matter what I am but they know to expect a brown person to walk through the door.&nbsp; 

As I have written about before,&nbsp; this country is so race stricken.&nbsp; My point is that there are so many issues and race seems to have a role in this factor.&nbsp; With accomplishments and failures races to seem to always be a factor."

"event","First Comerica announced they were moving to Dallas, Texas whats next our police force?&nbsp; Well no exactly, you see Comerica made the decision because it was hard to get people to come to Michigan.&nbsp; So I guess they said, well lets go to a place where people will come to.&nbsp;&nbsp; And to think, most people did not know that Comerica's headquarters was in Detroit to start of with, when they heard the news, they said well lets go to another bank.&nbsp; Right, lets get all of our money out of that bank and go else where, because the bank tellers, managers and customer service personnel will lose their jobs and that will cause the unemployment rate in Michigan to go higher, gee willikers that's a mighty good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michigan has enough problems why not add to it. 

Well anyways the reason I decided to blog today was because something interesting caught my eye.&nbsp; I was flipping through the Detroit Free Press and I happened to land on the classified section, yeah I know&nbsp;thats&nbsp;a big deal.&nbsp;&nbsp; But anyways I saw a ad for the Dallas Police Department, I usually don't read this section I thought it was funny to see this.&nbsp; First Comerica now the man and woman of the police force that have been laid off by the state due to budge cuts.&nbsp; To be fair there is also an ad for the Fairfax County, Virgina Police test ad is&nbsp;right underneath it. 

Michigan needs to get on the train of success soon.&nbsp; We are loosing out on too much too soon."

"event","A few days ago in class someone raised the question, will the new houses being build be kept up?  To me that was a great question since I was doing my research paper on the development of Detroit, trying to showcase the improvement that the city is making.  I took a look at the Jefferies Projects and other houses in the city of Detroit to understand why many people who not support the new housing projects.  I drove around neighborhoods and to Woodward to see the new projects and wondered if one day these houses or apartments would end up like the abandoned. 
         The question then came up about the government helping to improve the old houses.  In all honesty, I believe that the government rather tear down the house then to fix it.  
         Well anyways, nothing lasts forever and neither will these new houses and apartments popping up all over the city, but something can be done to maintain them so they do not end up ""abandoned"".  The truth is that one these houses will become old and maybe abandoned and someone will have a vision to restore the area and the cycle continues."

When many people think of Detroit they fail to realize that there is so much positive parts to the city.  They also fail to realize that no place is perfect, you could go to just about any city in the world and find an area of it that will be frowned upon because it is not well financed.  

I am not doing this to get anyone to feel differently about the city, many of you have made up your minds long ago.  I just want you to see that there is more to want you think you know about Detroit.

The Projects
These are the Jefferies Housing Project established in 1955, and later became known for drug dealing and prostitution.  Many of the housing project is set to be demolished in years to come.

There are so many wonderful restaurants in Detroit, but for some reason Coney Island Restaurants are all over the city.  Making Coney Island in my opinion the taste of Detroit.  Because there are so many, each restaurant has its own theme that makes them stand out from others.

I started thinking of all the things that I could do with $1,000.&nbsp; Well four of those will pay for my tution and I will still have money leaft over to buy a book or two, well maybe just a book.&nbsp; I could make a good investment, in the stock market with one of those.&nbsp; With a few of those I could buy a used car, or I could go shopping.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

What is Graffiti?  To me it is a form of art.  Many may say that it's offensive but what isn't.  The sweetest gesture could be taken as an insult.

The images I have selected show different levels of graffiti.  They all show a message even if the message is not understood.  From a mother and child, to a piece that looks like it would sell for millions in New York, to telling you what you should do, it is all art."

It is not what it used to be but what really is.  I do not promote some of the language used by rappers because I do feel it degrades the race as a whole at time.

"event","The songs that I would but on my mix tape representing my attitude towards my neighborhood or my community would be:

What Happened? (which would compare a past Detroit to a present Detroit)
Its Time for a Change!!! (That would encourage people to do something about the city's current state)
Home Sweet Home (There is no place like home, no matter how bad it is)
Home is Not a Four Letter Word (Meaning that home is what you make out of it)
D-E-T-R-O-I-T BASKETBALLLLLLL (Would represent that I am always a fan of the home team)
 Finally, my last song would be something that I would like to have represent the whole world. Union - By the Black Eyed Peas.  The song touched me and I would put it in my mixtape.  

For some reason people are not interested in the positive aspects of music. Rappers said the hottest thing out right now is getting rims put on your car, and many people heard and followed the trend.  But when Nas' was talking about getting an education, everyone heard, but not many people listerned.  

Then again looking at the world today, how many people want hear about the positive things in the world?  Shows like Jerry Springler and Murray are still on television today because people want to see the bad things, happening verses to the good things happening.

My point being that if the CD was to be released, it would get little to no radio time.  Rappers like Common, Talib Kwali, Lupe Fiasco among others do not get as much radio play because the relay messages that tell the truth verse to seeling a dream.  Get rich, buy expensive cars, buy expensive houses, buy expensive clothing, and buy expensive things that you don't need, while the truth is that everyone will not get rich."

I do not hate this city at all, when I am asked where home is I always respond in saying Detroit for now and the reason for that is that this is home for me and that is where the heart is. Detroit has so much history to it and I know very little of it.  Only God knows how many time I have walked and driving around this city and have not seen a building that I have felt should be torn down.  I see a building and just see what it has become not what it used to be.  I see how is a become a little waste land, where people drive by or even walk by and put their trash in it.  When I saw the article on Faded Detroit about the once upon a time Detroit Historic Site, I can't help but to think why keep it?  Is it better to keep it and have it rotting in a city that is trying to improve?

"event","Do to the kindness of Miss 'ailyn I've gotten my 'ands on a sketchbook. It's quite elegant and I'm wonderin' where the lil' thing got it- a black leather cover and back bound tightly to the numerous thick pages of sketchin' paper. The leather is thin enough that I'm thinkin' of embroiderin' me initals into a corner of the cover... But if I 'ave enough time, I'll fink on that. For now, I'm tryin' to find time to practice drawin' people. I mean, I've done plenty of flowers in the past, but I really like the shapes and forms of people...  so I've asked Mister Beaufort to sit for me. Also, Miss 'ailyn's been so kind as to agree to a sittin' too. And... for my first practice... perhaps, for an easy sketch, the stick-like doctor. Perhaps 'e'll shut is mouth and sit for a few moments? As it is, it may be just that... a few moments since I doubt it takes one long to draw such a gaunt figure on paper."

"event","People make no sense to me.

Especially men... 
God, I swear that I'd like to give each one of 'em a right smack just to set 'em right.

Then, maybe, they'd tell me what makes 'em tick.
Because I'm sure... others would like to know."

"event","The sky has already turned dark, but the candle's light is helpin' to cast a shadow on the scenery outside me window... snow is fallin' down heavy, and the little glitter of moonlight is makin' it such a pretty sight... *sighs* Perhaps I'll make plans to go out later tonight and celebrate the new year there, in the gardens- hopeful Tuesday won't fret to find me there so late... 

Though, sometimes, I don' feel like it'd be worth it. Worth me time to try an' enjoy life too much. Lately, I'm plagued by a constant feeling' of lonliness and, well, anger at meself. And after readin' the most recent letter from Jason... I serious feel as if I may have made a bad decision to come here... after all, I seem to always have somethin' upsettin' me..."

"event","I was walkin' down the 'all... just thinkin' I'd be on my way to me rooms, when I 'eard some most wonderful music... It reminded me of back 'ome with dance lessons with me brother... But I 'eard it and thought, ""Impossible? There's not bands in the school right now..."" And it turned out to be comin' from the library! Honest! I wondered what that saucy doctor was up to so I went to look in on 'im...

... and, horrible, that blonde woman was there. And the thing couldn't keep 'er mouth shut and looked at me as if I was some 'orrible pest. But... she was there with 'enry... I couldn't leave 'im with 'er for too long, right?

Ended up leavin' right quick though... that 'orror got on me nerves too much."

"event","Jason 'ad sent me a dress for the 'oliday, and it fit perfect- though, 'ow 'e knows me measurements I don' know... But I wore it to the 'oliday feast- thought maybe <i>he'd</i> notice 'ow much effort I put into it all, 'air and everythin'... But only Whitney seemed to notice. And 'e seemed to find 'imself likin' me lots more because of it- which is worryin' me since I don' know what to do. Though... I'm stickin' it through. I ain't got no other choice! *sighs*"

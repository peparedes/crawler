"event","Well after today i dont know i think it will be close to three months since I first got introduced to Joy :-) it doesnt seem like its been that long but yea i guess it has been.  And i know that not alot of people read this  so i dont really care what i write about.  And even if they did i would care i would still say this.  Joy since i meet you or since you and me became better friends. i dont remember the spacific date but i do remember it was somewhere around the time at the flag pole for national day of prayer.  and i know if i wanted to that i could go back in joys journal and find the exact day because she has a journal entrie (or how ever you spell it) about it. Any ways ever since then, everytime i talk to her or are in her presence i am just over joyed because i really enjoy her company. and i finally with a little encouragement from her got up the courage to tell her that i do like her and i do have feelings for her.  I dont really know how she took this or what she thought we never really got to discuss it because i had to leave in a hurry and i do appologizes (r how ever you spell it) if you were affended becasue i had to leave.  

Alright im going to go i have more to say but that can come at a later date.  any and all comments are welcome"

"event","So I asked him why he never told me has always had a thing for me... and he said ""I'm sorry."" And then later on he goes, ""I know it sucks, but shit happens."" I was thinking, ""Wow, thanks for not making me feel better. ha""

        Sorry this wasn't much, I took a huge break at the end of that short paragraph and sent Andy some lesbian porn pictures. haha. I'm sorry, I'm hyper as fu*k and couldn't resist.

"event","Why hello there my little kinderbots. This is my very first entry, as I am sure much of you have come to realize, which means it will most likely be very boring..... so I apologize. Anyways... I don't know what I should say, so I will ramble on about meaningless nothings, much of which you probably won't understand. So last night Nook the Book Reader told me something about 'my love' (the boy), and she said Kendy-Wendy had the conversation saved on her computator, and so naturally I asked Nook to ask Kanito if she would send it to me... but nooooo, Kendy was in bed and tired, so she forced me to wait until today to get it, except she is doing a lesson now, damnit. You can't tell someone something about something someone they like said, and then make them wait until later to see it, because then the first someone won't be able to sleep at night until they find out what the second someone said... but that didn't seem to matter to her. HA-wrap your mind around THAT one (the someones and somethings sentance). So I am listening to Bad Religion right now, great band by the way, and I find it so funny that Kim (my stepmom) punched two of the guys in the face from the band, I can't recall which ones, but hey, it's funny nonetheless. Anywho... today I have to go to Courtney's house because she has like half my closet, and she's had it since May or earlier, and I need my clothes back. Tomorrow i'm sleeping over Megg's house, and we're going out with Jimmy, Ruben, and Mike... I can't beleive Ruben is moving to Texas on Thursday, I feel so bad for Megan, because I know they both like eachother. :(   Jimmy is the cutest thing ever, and he is so funny, and I can't beleive E doesn't realize that she has him wrapped around her finger... poor kid, she needs to tell him she doesn't have any feelings for him before he gets his heart broken. I guess she knows she CAN break his heart, that's why she isn't doing anything... all these girls I know can get any guy they want, and they always wind up with the great ones, and they just throw them away because they know they can. Whatever, it's none of my business, but still. I heart drapery boy so much (haha Nook, Calpurnia hearts Curtania), and when I asked Nook how he couldn't have realized it by now, she told me boys are clueless and think you are just being flirty when in fact you adore them. I already knew that, but I tried not to beleive it, in hope that my obvious-ness had been acknowledged by now...but I guess it wasn't. :-\   He is still dating Jr. Rosery (shhh-her name is a secret, but if you know my situation, you know her name), grrr. I am in quite the pickle. Oh boy, now I am laughing so hard I am almost in tears... ""I didn't know the skin moved!"" HAHAHAHAHA!!! Ahh, well, we officially have gotten the first boring entry out of the way now, I might write later, but only if I am hyper, which will either be an entertaining entry, or a very confusing one... 
                  The One and Only,
                         Awesome and Amazing,
                                Mistro the Mouse"

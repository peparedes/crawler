"event","This is going to sound a little odd, but Dave, without him trying and with no logical thought process on my part, made me think of what I wanted to write here... so, dreams!

The other night I had a bizarre (and excruciatingly painful) dream about being threatened by some psycho killer and in the dream it got to the flight or fight stage... I decided to fight and kicked the attacker... only to then wake up in agony from having kicked the wall as hard as I could! (My name will surely become a popular rallying cry for the movement for installing air bags on walls)!  Why would that happen though!?  Surely things that happen in your subconscious aren't supposed to manifest themselves as unprovoked violence against inanimate partition walls which really had done nothing to deserve it!?

I will be at the Union tonight, doubtless embarassing myself in front of large numbers of people (as is my peculiar style)!  But Liz has my gorilla costume!  Hmph!  I may just go naked in some bizarre protest!

Well, anyway, enough of that!  Ciao!"

"event","Well, time to say ""hello"" to March.  There are now five days until the musical goes on stage! Haha!  If this thing actually works then I will be amazed.  Everyone has to come and watch though.  It should be a good laugh whatever happens.

I've been trying to cut the exclamation marks out of my writing, I hope you've all noticed.  Apparently it is immature... shock, horror! (ha, there's one)! (and again)

Well, I have to say that I am definitely with Holly at the moment on the complete lack of enthusiasm to do any work.  There's just too much of it to even know where to begin.  I have three essays which count for nothing but have to be done, each of 3000 words, due in two weeks.  I also have an assessed presentation to prepare for the same date as well as two essays which count for a quarter of my degree for which there is some deadline or other next week (the chances of my meeting that are as slim as they were for my meeting previous ones, which I didn't).  Oh, and then there's the small matter of having to produce a musical.  Nervous breakdown time, me thinks!

On the plus side I may have found someone to present a radio show with me, yay!

Following from my past comment about some people being arses whilst others are nice... what is it that makes arses such an arse!?  Furthermore, why are there some people who have a ridiculously overinflated sense of their own importance and specialness (I know it's not a word, but you get the idea)?  I know a few people who think the sun shines out of their arse and that they can do nothing wrong, despite actually being nigh on evil... why is that!?  Oh well, they will learn one day... when the revolution comes!  Talking of which, I really want to see that V for Vendetta film when it comes out, it looks fantastically weird!

Anyway, onwards to campus for a lecture about irreligion and the bastardry of Christianity.  Oh, history, what a wonderful degree thou art!"

"event","YAY!!  I went on the radio today to co-present the breakfast show with Mario!  It was soooo much fun!  If anyone out there wants to present with me next year then let me know!  I think it would be great fun!

I also managed to sort out my essays, so that's a weight off my shoulders!  Yay!!  

My second ""also"" is that some people are just crap, whereas others (specifically today Keely and Holly) are lovely!  I'm really liking the people who are nice simply because they know no other way of being.

Today I ended up sitting with Hana for about two hours just talking about anything and everything!  It was so nice to have an intelligent conversation with someone!  I was beginning to think that I would never have an intelligent conversation with anyone ever again!

Yeah, today has been a bit manic really!  I've been up from 6 this morning and have hardly had any time to just collapse and think about the world.

Anyway, on with the work whilst I listen to that silly song Holly gave to me....

Secondly, Mario has said I can present the breakfast show on the university radio station with him tomorrow!  That should be damn cool!  So if any of you are awake from 8 am you should listen!  It'll be yet another opportunity to laugh at my expense, so it's got to be worth doing!

"event","Yesterday was taken up by getting posters printed and getting one framed for Naomi to put on her wall, or wherever she decides to put it!  Then I briefly went to a rehearsal, met Naomi to give her the poster and then went with Holly to get fish and chips before picking Mario up to go to the cinema!  We saw Casanova, which was... urm... Venetian!?!?  I thought it was quite entertaining, but not something I imagine will receive great critical acclaim!  After that we went to Medicine where I got chatting to Anna for ages, so that was cool to catch up with her!

Then today, Holly and I went to London after discovering that one of the radiators in the house was leaking all over the floor!  We went to meet up with my mum, dad, sister, gran, aunt and uncle and had a good time doing so!  We cruised around Covent Garden before heading to Leicester Square for pudding, hand prints etc!  After that, Holly and I went to the Imperial War Museum!  I got to see the Lawrence of Arabia exhibition, which I was really excited about!  I thought I would never actually end up getting to it, but I did!  It was a great exhibition, as I had done a coursework essay on Lawrence so it was good to see some of what I had written about in real life, as it were.  We also went to see the Holocaust exhibition, which was really disturbing.  I felt terrible through the whole thing because it was so horrible.  I would agree with Holly that the holocaust isn't all there is to history, but it was a terrible period nevertheless.

Now I'm back home!  What to do with myself now!?!?  Who knows!  Perhaps Abi will decide for me!"

Yesterday I had to make a decision (shock horror)!  It wasn't something I wanted to do, and I don't think it will do me any good... but I suppose sometimes you have to think about more than just yourself.  Anyway, that aside... I went to the CRAZIEST night at the Union!  It was absurdly good fun!  I went with Holly, Joe, Mario, Nandi and Dan (the latter two being my two new housemates for next year)!  There was dancing, drinking (far too much), a Bavarian band from Yorkshire and lots of fun!  All we needed was for Sophie not to be swanning off in Italy and we could have had a house party, in the Union!  Holly and I got back at some time shortly before 4 and made our own pizzas!  

Today I woke up feeling just dead!  I didn't have a hangover because I generally never get them, but I felt like I was just sleepwalking! The day went fairly well, I had a course choices meeting for next year which was rivetting!  However, then two friends of mine from the musical were in a car crash.  So, that's not so good.

Now I have to make posters and be tired!"

"event","... An interesting name for a course, I'm sure you'll agree!  It also sums up what is plaguing my mind at the moment!  Fun!  Is it possible that some people just come out in a rash at the mere mention of the word 'honesty'?  It would certainly explain a lot!  The worst ones are those who say something similar to ""Oh, I was just trying to protect you""!  What am I, an infant!?  No Father Christmas jokes, if you please!!  Anyway, the truth has a mysterious way of getting out and making everything a hundred times worse!

APART FROM THAT!

I met up with Nandi and Dan today to show them around our beautiful and amazing House Of Dreams!  They're grand, and we're going to go to the Bavarian night at the Union... discreetly called Alcofest!  Not that we have a skewed stereotype of our German cousins, or anything like that!

Also, I haven't updated this for a while... which means that you've missed out on all the exciting happenings of my little world!  So, in no particular order (or coherence) here's what I've been up to!

T-shirts and hoodies arrived for The Thing About Men, I am wearing mine now!  It looks HOT!!  Honest!  The posters have also been (almost) finished!  So yay!  I went to the Comedy Night in Medicine, which was damn funny!  So yay for that!  I've actually started going to Medicine to do my work because it's warmer and less boring than the library!!  I got quite a bit done there the other day!  I'm moving classes in my 18th century course because mine smells and Sara assures me that the one she's in is great fun!  So that's rather good!  Anything else?!  Blah!!

So, yeah, a bit of a rant and a catch up today... for those of you with nothing better to do than read about such things!  Now to dose up on painkillers for the first time... ever!!  My head is killing me!!

Anyway!  On Sunday Holly, Sophie, Mario and myself went to the Monkey's Forehead for their new comedy night thing!  It was grand, although I had seen some of the comedians already.  I only drank water, which I think makes me super cool!  Holly and I also made a music video of me doing weird stuff to the melodic tunes of Frontier Psychiatrist!

I started reading for one of my essays of death... and so have inevitably just become even more confused than when I started!

"event","Hehe, today has been GRRRRRREAT!!

It got off to a shaky start when I had to struggle for ages to find somewhere to do my photo shoot!  I was in the Union at 9... apparently long before most people come into work there!  Eventually I found somewhere, the model turned up... a lovely girl called Naomi, and we got through a whole roll of film and took a hell of a lot of photos on my digital camera too!  I felt like a bit of a perv getting her just in her bra, but I suppose it had to be done for the poster!  It's a tough life!  But then Josh, Bastard Face, managed to destroy my digital camera, so none of them worked!

After the photo shoot I bumped into Sara from my history class.  We ended up talking for about two hours!!  That was good as usually people don't talk to each other in seminars!  She's very nice and definitely an interesting person!

Then I met up with Sophie, Emma and Eleanor and had some lunch!  Then Sophie and I walked down to Egham to get my film developed and she had a Subway in Egham's latest eating establishment!  I phoned Dave to tell him aboout it... and before I knew it Sophie had downed a subway one foot in length filled to bursting point with salad and meat!  What a pie face!

The photos came out well and we went to Medicine to chill, and met up with Josh!  All three of us are ill, so we were felling sorry for ourselves!  Elly was working at the bar so I got a big cuddle and a free drink, with cocktail umbrella!  Sweet!  Then I went to play pool with Becky, Sam and Sam's friend Jo.  That was good!

Then off home with the girls, where we bumped in to Charlotte and Ashley!  That was cool!  We added Charlie to our posse and headed further in the direction of home... where we bumped into Daryl!  After half an hour we were on our way again!  Yay!

Now I'm listening to Keely on the radio before I head off to the Union (again) for Coyote Ugly night!  Joyous!  I WILL lose my voice though!  Arse!

All in all, a bloody good day!  I've really enjoyed myself!"

I actually had a good time, as I had been worried I might not really fit in.  The American girl, Ashley, and I share a common love of cider.  So I got on well with her!  And, yeah, it was just good fun!

The music has finally arrived for The Thing About Men!  Yay!  And a beautiful girl has come forward to volunteer to be a model for my poster!  I'm looking forward to meeting her and doing a sexy photo shoot, it should be a bit different and a good laugh!

Also, yesterday, Holly, Sophie and I were interviewing some potential housemates for next year.  We found two we liked, but there are still more people to see.  I met another one in Medicine last night who seemed nice!  She's a first year history student... I think!  Oh, our house is so sexy!

Other than that I've just been trying to get these essays finished!  My last one is now late, but I just can't seem to bring myself to care enough to do it!  I am so bored of the format of the course now!  It's just the same old tasks under a different guise every time... there's no real challenge apart from actually getting them done on time.

Well, I'm going to carry on building the tower of tissues I have created coming out of my bin!  It's an amazing piece of architecture and is made from just paper and snot!"

Today consisted of being really rather ill with some kind of flu bug but soldiering on anyway!  I dressed up as a pirate (with a halo) and paraded around campus with a similarly clad Holly, Emma, Sophie and (other girl) bursting into lectures and classes around campus shouting my head off about giving money to RAG and how doing so will save your soul... they could trust me, I had a halo on!  It was terribly good fun, and definitely something a little bit different!  I think we brought some joy into the lives of people who would otherwise have had their happiness trodden on by lectures!  I did, however, discover that management students are all complete bastards!  Not one of them donated anything and they were all really rude!

I then had a crisis meeting with The Thing About Men production team!  The music still hasn't arrived, which means we have two weeks to learn a whole musical... assuming it does arrive tomorrow!  Not so good!

Holly, Emma and I celebrated Valentines Day in style today!  They got me a card, which was very good of them!  It made me giggle inside!  This evening we went and got fish and chips and had a good chat about all sorts of things!  So that was grand!

Now I'm going to bed as I think I may die from exhaustion soon!

There was me, Holly, Emma, Sophie, Hana, Josh, Mario, Becky, Sam, Joe, Sarah, Chris, Tim, Craig and Tom!  Much alcohol was consumed, and there was a video made too... which should be very interesting to watch!  I managed to burn myself on the oven, which wasn't such a good experience... but the alcohol numbed the pain!  I got some boobies, although that wasn't exactly much to do with me!!

What has been going on in the world of me today then!?  Well, for starters, sodding hell! What have I done!?  Oh yes, that's it... reading!  Snore-o-rama!  That was this morning's activity!  Then off to my lecture and seminar avec a certain Holly shaped critter!  We had lunch in TW20s, which is always a gorgeous experience!  

Then, all of a sudden it was 5 o'clock and I had an hour before the Production Team meeting for The Thing About Men!  Cue me rushing to the library to frantically prepare an agenda for said meeting and reply to myriad emails!  Then off to the meeting in Tommy's, where I bought cake and got squished by Elly - a highlight for anyone's day!  I had the meeting moved to Medicine for use of a table and comfy settees... mmmm, Medicine!  The rehearsal, which followed the meeting like a cat follows a mouse (covered in blood and tufts of fur), was wonderful!  I didn't stay until the end as I realised I had a seminar which needed reading for. I went home from Jane Holloway Hall via a trip down memory lane, which was... good!?

Anyway, drawing a discreet veil underneath that...

I went to another rehearsal for The Thing About Men this evening, which was extremely funny!  I enjoyed it muchly!  I have to film some of what goes on!  Who knows, I could even send it to You've Been Framed and make myself a few quid!

Well, that was more or less it!  I've had a good night in Medicine (see, I told you I was an addict)!  But there are some people who are so horrible to others that they just don't deserve to be alive!  I'm mentioning no names, but anyone who knows me well enough can probably guess which people I'm on about!

Abi is taunting me with breasts!!  Damn her to hell!  If any of you are women with breasts, feel free to send me photos!

Next door are playing some kind of emo/rap/heavy metal combination band at ridiculous volume... so that's good of them!  It truly sounds awful, like the musical equivalent of an exploding badger!  Students!

I have my new phone now, it does great things... like phoning people and sending them messages, so I'm happy!

I've turned into a bit of a Medicine junky recently (by which I mean the bar rather than the pills)!  It's a sort of repetition of last year where I ended up there almost every night for one reason or another!  Last night it was for the Comedy Night, which was supremely good!  Holly and I got free entry because I'm sleeping with the president of the Comedy Society... or am I!?!?  The mystery continues!  After that finished some of us went to get food (I resisted the temptation myself, I bet you must be so proud of me) and then went to Founders and pissed about!!    I got to bed at some time after 3 and then was up at 8 with all the enthusiasm and happiness of a McDonalds employee!  Lectures were boring and I got through the seminar by making jokes... my usual tactic for when I don't have a clue what's going on!

The musical is going well!  I need to get a ticket for the school disco on Saturday and think of a way to inoffensively ask girls to let me take photos of them without much clothing - them with no clothes, rather than just me being a naked photographer!  

Oh!! And I have incredible pain in my mouth from what I can only assume is a widom tooth fighting the shackles of oppression and demanding its right to be seen in all its wisdomy glory!  I can only imagine what Marxist historians would make of the Revolution of Luke's Mouth!  Is it a fundamental reworking of the social order, or simply a palace coup!?  Does anyone really care!?

On that note I'm going to go and scream, partly to vent my frustration with next door for being such noisy bastards and partly at my mouth for being a hotbed of enamelled sedition!"

My new phone should be arriving today, so that's something to get stupidly excited about!!  Also I'm going to have to deal with the Student's Union again today... joy!  I swear they will drive me insane!  On a happier note I should also be seeing Alex Windscheffel today... the lecturer almost every girl I know fancies, but none of them quite know why!

Well, I've finished eating my breakfast now, so it's on to more academic things!

"event","Today I have felt more lethargic than a lethargic person!  Even not doing anything is too much of an effort!

I'm now convinced that a large majority of the people I know are hopeless!  I send emails, text messages and letters and try to keep in touch with people from school and only ever hear back from two of them!  Seriously, what would be so difficult about even just confirming you are still alive!?  Ok, rant over!

This term is shaping up to be the best yet!  I've decided just to get out there and have a good time!  Royal Holloway is definitely as fun as you make it, and I'm determined to make it fun!  It's amazing how you can change yourself in little ways.  I've really tried to be more approachable and also, more importantly, to approach more people.  I'm happy to start up a conversation with anyone about anything, which I wouldn't have done before.  I'm getting involved in things which I wouldn't have bothered doing before.  The only downfall with this way of going about things is that I now have no time for my work!  Or at least that's what I tell myself.  I think the truth is actually that I just don't want to do it.  My course doesn't interest me as much as it once did.  Or, no, it is interesting... but I would much rather just be interested in it rather than having to jump through academic hoops with essays.  But I suppose I can't really get a degree without actually doing some work!

I think I may be changing in more respects than just an increased willingness to engage in small talk!  I'm definitely less inclined to do things for people who wouldn't give me the time of day unless they want something.  I suppose that fits in with the useless friends thing.  I've also kind of released myself from the past in some respects.  I've taken down things from my walls which tie me to things that once were with a determination to replace them with things that now are.  I definitely feel a lot less burdened now than I have done for a long time.  I got my hair cut... though I don't know what the significance of that is!  I think I'm also finally sorting out what it is that I want.  I don't know if this makes any sense... but generally I always do what everyone else wants, now though I want to do things which I will enjoy.  I'll still always be there for the people I care about, but there's no reason why I shouldn't do things that I will enjoy as well, hopefully with the people I care about.

So for someone suffering from acute lethargy this has been a remarkably long and strange post.  Good night!!"

I took him to Medicine where we drank and played pool, then went to Crosslands where we drank these great cocktails and talked to people in posh frocks, then went to a dinner in the Picture Gallery (very posh) which was grand!  Then we went back to Medicine and drank some more, and played pool again.  After that it was to the Union to dance the night away 80s styley! That was damn good!

So what have I learned from my interesting night out!?  Well, firstly, I think I am immune to alcohol, at least in its more severe aspects!  I can get tipsy and wobble about a bit, but no matter what I do I can't induce my own coma!  Secondly, I really don't want another girlfriend!  Even though there were lots of pretty girls I just wasn't bothered by it all.  Thirdly, never EVER will I lose my cloakroom ticket again... having to wait around begging security to let me have my jacket back is no fun!

All in all it was a very fun night and I really enjoyed myself!  

Now, though, I have to concentrate on getting some work done!  Joy!"

I also had lunch with Kudzayi at which point we discovered just how hopeless a certain student orientated organisation can be!  I did have a delightful sausage baguette though!
So far this is my day in reverse!!  So, jumping ahead of the seminar... I had a production team meeting and then the first proper rehearsal for The Thing About Men!  That went very well!
We've had so many amazing ideas for The Thing About Men!!  I even get to go to the Union with the express purpose of taking photos of scantily clad young ladies!!  Does life get any better than that!?!?

I'm beginning to think there is nothing more to life than filling out bits of paper!  Or is that overly jaded!?

Tonight is Shipwrecked night... which I think translates to terrible pirate costume and lots of alcohol to make it look better!  How many times does alcohol go into cold and flu medicine, to three decimal places!?  So no doubt I will construct some garbled sentences about that later/tomorrow!

"event","Wooo!!  Holloway!!

Today has been a rip-roaring and swash-buckling adventure!  (Hey, I never claimed to be above hyperbole)!  I made a poster for The Thing About Men, and put big copies of it up around campus with Liz!  Yay!  I also did a tiny amount of work on the Thing About Men website!

Also, I went and had dinner with Josh and Matt and then went to Medicine to play poooool!  So that was good!  Suffice to say I lost in both games!  Go me!

My face is falling off from being sun burnt, which isn't such a good look!  Not that any of my looks are particularly fantastic!!  

Following the ""If a tree falls down and there's nobody there, does it make a sound?"" school of thought... if there was a night at a club and nobody went to it, would it be a good night!?  Muse upon that if you will!

Now I must fly into the sunset!"

"event","I got back from ten days in America today - hence not having updated this sooner!  I went to see Emma (the one who recently dumped me... damn her to hell!) and we went travelling around a bit!  We started off in New York - climbed the Empire State Building which was grand, went to see the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and went walking around!  I saw Times Square and we ate in Planet Hollywood which was really good!  Then off to the Orlando area!  We went go-karting, played crazy golf and went to Disney MGM Studios (a damn cool place)!  Then off to Miami, where Will Smith lives (honest)!  There we played on the beach, went on a funky Duck Tour and got very sun burnt!  Then back to New York - we walked all through Central Park, saw Wall Street, went to the site of the World Trade Centre, saw Grand Central Station (very nice) and the UN!

So that was really fun!!  Very expensive though, la di da!  However, despite having a wonderful time, Emma still wants to be single so that's a little depressing!  Never mind though!

Now I have to get ready to go back to Holloway!  Wooo!!  I have a load of stuff to do so I really should get on with it!!

Over and out!"

"event","I saw the wonderful Strasz today!  What a treat!  I also saw Andy, which was a truly beautiful experience!  I also had to talk to my dad about how I intend to pay for this crazy trip to America... that was good!

To all my friends who have been nice to me in the past few weeks after my recent... bad luck, thank you!  I will try to think of ways that I can repay you all!  I will send you all emails when I am in America, assuming I can get my grubby little mittens on a computer, to let you know how things are going!  I hope I can send you all some good news for once!!

No hair death today!  I went to the hair dressers but it was closed!  It may be a bank holiday, but that is no excuse!  When there is hair in need of cutting then Super Stylist should be there to save the day!  Now hundreds of innocent people will have to die for this terrible mistake.  Oh, it's a hard life being the brutal dictator of a semi-fictitious anarchist state!  Can you dictate an anarchist state!?  Is there even such a thing as an anarchist state!?  All these questions, and more, answered tonight in a special edition of World Politics With Pamela Anderson!

Also, before I go, I'd like to announce some wonderful news!  Dave is pregnant with my baby!  Now if that's not momentous then I don't know what is!"

"event","Oh!!  Flogging Molly kick arse!  They can even make death bouncey!*

Well, today could end up being a momentous one!  I am contemplating getting a hair cut!  I don't really know what I want so I'm thinking of just going in and saying ""Just do what you like!""  It's wonderful having almost no respect for your own appearance!!  Life is so much easier!

At the moment I am desperately trying to get some work done!  So far it's not worked so well, especially since I can't concentrate on anything for more than a few minutes!  My mind is elsewhere!  I'm supposed to be reading about the fall of the Singapore naval base in 1942... but since I don't know what my essay question is yet, it's making doing research for it a little difficult!  So if anyone happens to know a lot about this particular topic then feel free to save me!

Right, must go!!  To Newbury!!  Wooooo!!  I may write something with an actual point later!

Ciao bella!

*Flogging Molly are an Irish-esque band who sing about all sorts, but all with a background of fantastically bouncey and dancey Irisih music!  I am a bit of a fan of Irish music, and the Irish in general!"

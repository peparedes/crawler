Can't you see that i wanna be there with open arms 
It's empty tonight and i'm all alone 
Get me through this one 
Do you notice i'm gone? 
Where do you run to so far away? 
I want you to know that I miss you I miss you so 
I want you to know that I miss you I miss you so 
I'm writing again these letters to you on much I know 
But i'm not sleeping and you're not here 
The thought stops my heart 
Do you notice i'm gone? 
Where do you run to so far away? 
I want you to know that I miss you I miss you so 
I want you to know that I miss you I miss you so 
I want you to know that I miss you I miss you so

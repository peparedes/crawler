Dear Everyone,
I HATE POT.
I hate potheads.
I hate when people think they're cool.
I hate the way people act when they're high.
I hate what people will go through to get it.
I hate when people base their lives around it.
I hate the way it makes me feel when I'm around it.
I hate when people will not call their friends so they can go smoke pot.
I hate when, after doing all this, some of you then complain that you're not going to get into college.
I hate the fact that all of my one-time best friends that I now have little or no contact with anymore are all potheads.
I hate anyone that is going to comment on this and tell me I'm wrong/try to defend themselves/try to explain anything to me. I don't care if I'm being gay about it. I don't care what you have to say anymore to be honest with you, and if you try to say anything, I will gladly admit that I'm stubborn and will tell you to fuck off.

I had that entry a few weeks ago when I wanted to fix stuff. I take it all back. At this point, I could care less if I never spoke to any of you ever again. 

If you are planning on getting high, or have any ""awesome"" stories about getting high, I don't fucking care. Don't tell me about it because honestly, I don't think you're cool, I don't think it's awesome, and my respect level for you as a human being just goes away.

I hate you.



IN RESPONSE TO THIS:

WAY TO GET MAD AT EVERYONE FOR DOING SOMETHING YOU USED TO DO. LET EVERYONE LIVE LIFE FOR THEMSELVES AND DONT JUDGE PEOPLE. DONT FORGET...MOST OF THE PEOPLE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ARE GOING THRU THEIR HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR STAGE..PEOPLE CHANGE...THINGS CHANGE...PEOPLE ARE FREE TO DO WHATEVER THE FUCK THEY WANT...SO BEFORE YOU TELL ME OR ANYONE TO FUCK OFF...YOU FUCK OFF CUZ HONSESTLY...FOR SOMEONE THATS A GOOD, SMART KID LIKE YOU...YOU SHOULD HAVE FOUND A BETTER WAY TO HANDLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND NOT BASH PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE FRIENDS YOU HAVE."

"event","ok, so lately a lot of things have been bothering me, and ya kno what, its time to get it out, so here we go!

1. my real friends kno who they are. if you have to, for one second, question my actions, think im SHADY, or disagree with something normal i do in my life, then you can go fuck yourself, cuz ur not my fucking friend. 

2. yes, i do have many people that id like to think of as close aquaintences,(spelling?), or just people i like hanging out with. i hate to tell you, but the word ""friend"" means a lot to me, so dont take offense if i dont call you or just dont wanna hang out with you sometimes. 

3. some people that ive seen as being my friends, are quickly turning around to show me that they really arent who i think they are. its really pissing me off and i really fucking dont care if i start to hurt people and make them feel like they arent close to me anymore. LIFE IS TOO SHORT FOR DRAMA. 

so on an endnote, life is definately way too short for drama, and im not dealing with it. so im ending it right now. if u feel like u need to be mad at me for this or just disagree with me, fine...i really dont care. and if u do agree with this, dont make urself feel stupid if u really think ur my friend and ur not by responding to this. i will just laugh in anger. yes, laugh.

"event","so, this has been yet another stellar weekend. friday absolutely rocked the hisouse. the mike anzano benefit went well, except for some retarted bros that were 16 and tried scaring me by saying they are wrestlers. ha, what a joke. but ne way, after that, i went to see folly at starland. all i have to say is, folly was fucking amazing. nightmare of you also blew me the fuck away. good show, besides the rediculous amount of bros. after that, i drove spinelli back to his house and then met up with emily, tim and art-man. the rest of the night was incredible. :). 

and then there was yesterday. yesterday was good and bad. i woke up in the morning and went to work. that was gay as hell. i left early cuz i wasnt feeling so hot. so then i went to go get some shit done and what not. picked up little matt, went out to lunch with jake, etc. i decided to take a friggin aderol and almost wound up dying. that wasnt fun. it really fucked with me. it sucked. but i wound up calming down and shit so im fine. after that whole ordeal wss over, the rest of the night, into the wee hours of the morning was pretty friggin amazing. and none of you need to know why. :). 

so ne way. im at matts right now, we just wrote yet another ridiculous acoustic song.

Pushing passed me spilling through the banks 
And I fall 
Faster than light and faster than time
That's how memory works 
At least in the dark where I'm searching for meaning 
When I'm just searching for something 
I want out
Out of every ackward day
Out of every tongue tied loss 
I want out
Out of the burdening nightsweats
Out of the rising seas of blood 
Lost in you like saturday nights 
Searching the streets with bedroom eyes 
Just dying to be saved

I feel like I'm going to break 

bright sun sinking low 
I never feel afraid to let emotions show 
well I did now take a look at me 
I had a close brush before your destiny 

before I am done youll be victims of 
my stories tales lies and exaggerations 
Im gonna 
when youre living life like a show 
You gotta take a bow to the people you know 
I said lie for me 
lying under across the street all engrossing in my brain 
feeling like Im going a little insane 
close inside feels like Im going insane 

red lights are sinking low 
I grab another beer because its time to go 
I feel my head burst 
I head out to your car 
and I pray to Jesus Christ but you wont get too far 
I say 
Headlights and second gear 
I run the road of life to escape the things you fear 
I said that you might that you might find a better way 
To justify the evil things that you say 
help me please 
Help me please because Im falling upon my knees 
I said falling down to my knees 
Pray to the Lord up above 

Help me I'm falling down 
Feeling now the cold cold cold hard ground 
Haunting faces moving lights Im the party boy tonight 
Pound it hard you're gunna pound it again 
But please just do not bump up my friend 
Cause it feels alright gunna push him around 
But I cant be taken for no clown

LETS GROW UP PEOPLE. so ne way, that was the venting part of the entry.

"event","hello live journal people.....so here was my day

called alli bright and early...we got our summer registration done and shit like that, i think if it werent for alli helping me out with this, id be a lazy bitch and not do it, so much thanks to her on that.

then i did some shit around my aunts house, rode the bike around to the park and everything cuz im a fat shit and i need to lose weight. 

then i got my grandparents from my aunts house in staten island and went back to nj. 

band practice was supposed to happen today in prep for our supposed show tomorrow, however both of those things went down the tubes. 

i hung out with matt around like 630ish, we were planning on going to the band practice, shya, that fell through. so then mike calls me up, i havent seen mike in like 23423412 years, or so it seems, so i went and met up with them and plethera of the other nerds at annas house. i got to see chris d. and matt fav which was cool, ryanXYZ came over too which rocked the hizouse. so basically we watched gothica while all the little annoying biatches were talking during the movie. the movie rocked...as soon as it was over allison pulled a very clever prank on me...got me real good :). so me and matt decided shortly after that, that we should give tim a call...since he interuptted during the movie...(bastard!)..ne way...so matt and i met up with tim and yuri fain at CRAPplebees...had a bite to eat. good times. we decided to take a ride over to my friend mike liebes' place to see how he prepared for his ""velvet rope"" party. sometimes i wonder what goes on in my friend's heads...people have to dress in a dress shirt and tie to get in...its kinda gay yet it can be funny...not sure if im going. i stood there for maybe like 25 minutes then went home..

i got home and woke up my mom out of a coma to tell her i was there lol. then i called alli. we talked for a good 2 hours about tons of stuff.our conversations are the best. a few things came up though and got my mind racing. she feels like i act shady sometimes towards her and it tears me apart. being shady towards her is the last thing i wanna do. all i want is to make this work out between the 2 of us. this girl means everything to me, as if all you morons already didnt know that. i gotta pick it up now and get back into relationship mode because im sucking at it. 

ANYONE THAT READS THIS...PLEASE HELP ME OUT WITH THIS GUYS. ALLI IS PLAYING A BIG PART IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW. DO NOT LET ME MESS THIS UP. LEAVE COMMENTS ON HOW I CAN BE THE BEST GUY TO HER THAT I CAN. 

IM TIRED AS HELL. IT IS OFFICIALLY BED TIME."

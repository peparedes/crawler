"event","All I can say is wow... just wow. You think you know someone, think you can trust them... but it turns out that its none of the above, and recently, the truth has become more apparent for more than one person. 

I hate to name names, but I'm sure these two will know who they are, simply because they must surely know what they are doing, either way they have no heart, but if they dont know, then they should really take a long hard look at themselves.

First one. A friend I have been close with for a few years. Things were great for awhile, until the realisation of real life hit me, and I couldnt do anything about.. anything. We would talk every day, talk about our weekends, all the usual stuff, but in truth, behind my back, this person who declares that he cares for me so much, tells other people that I am some live sick girl who is stalking him. I mean.. honestly. If you are that starved for attention, if you have to lie to people to cover up how you feel, you are kidding yourself. I made my feelings clear a long time ago, that things just couldnt be and would never be. We kept in touch and stayed close friends, you helped me through a tough breakup. but perhaps you should take a look at who you are really trying to impress and get the sympathy vote from. Because it is no longer me. I loathe you for your actions at work the other day. They were careless, and stupid. You could have lost a lot more than your job, and you know it. I hate people who give up on life, who hate everything that they do and is never happy even though you choose to do these things.
Grow up.

the second person I have not come to a final conclusion. Who knows. maybe its just a bad week and things will return to normal soon."

"event","Tuesday after the Queen's birthday long weekend. Gotta love that little old lady, giving us a public holiday and all. I had a friends wedding and a 21st this weekend, one after the other. Kinda nuts if you ask me and my plans went bad from the word go to woah. 

The Plan:
Saturday night: Go to the wedding - drink minimally to stay under the limit to drive home and save the hangover so one is fresh and ready for the next day to clean the house.

Sunday day: Clean the apartment - clear the apartment of unnecessary crap that seems to build up without noticing.

Sunday night: attend Kim's 21st, pay Steph for pretty bra and cape, say a nice speech and make polite conversation with the drunkards before leaving at a reasonable to get home safely.

Monday day: relax and enjoy a clean house and make use of the movie channel.

The ALTERNATIVE Plan (what actually happened)

Saturday afternoon: raining. beautiful wedding outside though.
Saturday night: proceeded to the reception in car. Drank a glass of wine.. then two.. three.. four.. losing count.. left car at the reception venue, caught a cab home, passed out in the back of the cab (urgh) then stumbled upstairs to my apartment and passed out.

Sunday day: a blue of feeling sick and horribly hung over

Sunday night: drove up to Kims, still feeling a bit weak in the tum, but otherwise, ok. Put on sexy scary make-up to go with the cape and scary theme of the night. wore lace up knee high boots, which were impossible to get on and off quickly to enjoy full use of jumping castle. Serious wardrobe malfunction as it was BLOODY FREEZING. Drove friend home and got back to apartment at 1:30am.. passed out from exhaustion.

Monday day: got up, grudgingly cleaned apartment and tool out several bags of useless crap (what was I thinking) had a shower and took a look in the mirror to find horribly blotchy red skin. hooray for hayfeaver and an amazing amount of dust. SO my skin was burning and I was fearing that it was going to fall off as I made my way to the shops for food shopping. Lunch was horrible, so didnt eat much, got home, planned a massive dinner and just felt bleh. 

Tuesday morning: I was overcome with a sense of lonliness this morning. waking up to a teddy bear beside me whilst thinking about how close and happy steph and kaz looked last night to their respective others. I do not like the situation I am in now. But I'll bounce back at the prospect of netball on thursday night. But I am starting to put weight on again after being sick. So I have the option of pushing myself at the gym more, or attempting to mirror the illness I had and starve myself again. Sometimes I hate the world that we live in which portrays such a need to be skinny. even my parents want me to lose more weight. I dont know how much is enough, even though me.. myself.. I am still feeling like I have more to lose.

i dunno.

"event","Another day at the office, another day of constant dribble of bits and pieces of work that need to be done, but just get in the way of what really needs to be done. Ie, magazine and stuff and stuff. meh.

Weekend report: spent far too much money on necessities and not on just stuff that I want hehehe. kinda sucks, but that's life I guess. I did manage to get away with 2 new tops and a nice set of wine glasses. So all is not lost.

And I dunno how, but I think I managed to upset Scott.. I'm not sure what I did or said, but it was around losing his leveling pet on lens. Should I be worried that I am so out of touch with a friend that I dont know when I piss them off? o.O

"event","OK, so I have given in to the hype and joys and live journal mania. It seems like everyone I know has one, so now it is time to give in and conform. I'm sorry glittering pink journel, you are no longer required.

So what to write about? Its been a weird sort of day. I have had to say good bye to one friend, try and make up loast ground with another, and was randomly surprised by an old friend. So its been, sad, trying and surprised. Work has been breathing down my neck today, yet they couldnt have done all this earlier. Yesterday I had nothing, today.. woah. I mean.. eww.

I guess its about time I posted something about Lensmoor as well.

I dont know why everyone has me pegged as.. well.. a ""slut"". I dont know what I have done to deserve it, but it made my gaming life hell. Its weird how it affected me, because I have never seen myself as ""in with the guys"" or anything. I've enjoyed my gameplay so far, and I hope that I can slowly change peoples opinions of me. 

I feel annoyed that, even though I have donated, my char got deleted -again-. I had a big grrr fest to Dredor, and I feel horrible for doing so. Anyone who knows me well knows that I hate doing that.

As far as first posts go, this one is looking pretty crappy, so I'll end it here and try again tomorrow.

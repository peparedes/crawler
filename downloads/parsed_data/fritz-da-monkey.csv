"event","ok from now on every time I feel like it I'm going to post quotes.

from master Fisher my chinese kenpo teacher. for those of you who didn't know I am an orenge belt (soon to be purple tip) in chinese kenpo.
master Fisher said this while teaching a wepons class and trying to convince his students that if a knife is pulled on them they should run. (duh)

""if you tie two tigers together by the tail, one will go to the hospital, the other to the grave"".

this is from a sticker that was on alex's backpack.

""guns don't kill people gaping holes in vittel orgins kills people"". and my version. ""H-bombs don't kill people, kenetic energy kills people""

if you have a quote post it."

Every one at the fellowship needs to take a step back before i get realy mad at them. being made fun of isn't that big ohf a deal, ok, get over it and be friends again. you people keep saying that your not friends but i looked at your friends pages and you (acording to your friends page) are still friends. stop being drama queens ( you know who you are) and be friends. now see what youve done. all you fighting has turned me in to barney. do this again and i'll sing really bad songs at you!!!!

the Daily Show with Jon Stewart kicks but and there book is even better. (they payed me to say that).
Damn. I ran out of things to say already.

I thought of something to say. I cant remember what it was.

Don't even pay attention to my spelling, I already know it sucks.

I can't what to get a PSP (for those of you out there who aren't nerds like me, the Playstasion Portable). it looks so cool. its got wifi, mp3 player, it plays movies if you get them on the little disks, and it plays games and has better graphics then the Nintendo DS!!!! I also cant what to get doom 3 for the Xbox. it looks just as good as the PC version but is on a console. There are those who would say that the first person shooter  isn't meant for the console but there wrong. the first person shooter (a.k.a. fps) was invented for the console."

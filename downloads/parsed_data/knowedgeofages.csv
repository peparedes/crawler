"event","I'm learning that I need to learn from past mistakes. You would think someone like me would know what it's like to lose a lover. Yet, I'm sitting here beside Vic watching him die, watching him being taken away from his family and friends and I know that I can't handle it. I snapped at Rupert when he came in, he was trying to get me to eat something.  We ended up having a long talk, about what he's feeling about how I seem to be drafting away from the Pack, from my mates, family, and friends. From everything that I'm letting myself die along side Vic. 

Yes, I was making plans to go find a vampire, to go in fur form and bite him myself, or just try any kinds of magic light or dark. That would of been unfair to him, that would of been stealing his chance at peace. Yes, I know he needs it, I know he needs a long rest. I'm just not sure how to handle it all. I finely cried last night, I finely let myself melt into Rupert. He stayed the night with me. We both sat and watched Vic sleep. 
<lj-cut>
He's going home tomorrow, he'll pretend like there's nothing wrong, because he doesn't want to upset them. He doesn't want to see them sad nor does he want them to remember him like this, sick in a bed. But I'll be going back and forth, I'll be checking on him, loving him. Rupert tried to heal him a little last night. I think it gave him back some of his coloring but his touch can not heal the illness that has taken hold of Vic's body. 

When it finely happens and he's at peace, I'll go to Debbie and Michael, I'll tell them all the funny stories. How he took over the hotel kitchen from Gina, how he laughed when I ate to much chocolate far to close to the moon. I'll tell them how much I loved their brother and Uncle, I'll tell them that they aren't alone  in their sadness. But right now I think I'll get some rest. Hank is over him and I need to sleep in Rupert's arms."

Second:  My new hair color going to be hot pink, right now I'm walking around with white hair. I looked into the mirror after I did it. So I look a little bit like Spike, but he's got a better jaw line then I do. 

Third: Walka's friends are really nice. I like them, Gina used to watch their 'show'. She used to think (might still do) that Blair is/was hot. I can see why. Jim really cool too, I want to learn more about him. I want to learn more about everyone. 

Fourth: I love Walka. 

5th: I need to learn how to count.

Make that 6th and 7th as well. 
(8th: I can't stop thinking about him.)

Oh, and Ninth: Hot pink. Yes. yay.

Tenth: It's hot here and I think I'm the only person who likes it. Well, besides the vampires.

"event","Well lessons have started and it seems I have five replicas of Fred and George.  Thats five individuals not five pairs.  Thank the Goddess.  This afternoon before my lesson with my third years began I took a moment to rest in my chair, much to my dismay there was an magically enhanced version of a whoopie cushion in my seat.  Not only did it make a horrid sound which my class found terribly amusing, but also it was covered in some hideous slime that would not clean off either my robes or my chair.  

Aside from that however my first month into Term has been surprisingly uneventful.  My old potions master has returned to school though unfortunately not to teach as of yet.  Next term if he has not recovered from his recent venture there will be a particularly unique individual assigned to the position.  As of right now each professor is taking turns teaching lessons for the potions classes.  

My Beloved and I have just recently returned from a trip to visit our mothers in Los Angeles.  Far too much happened there for me to write in just one post.  All in all however it was quite an adventure.  As all visits with our mothers tends to be.  It was good seeing Buffy and the slayers again. I still don't think Detective Knight likes me much.  I think Jeanette would rather make me lunch that make me a part of her family.  I know LaCroix would rather have nothing to do with me, but then again hes always been rather stiff around me.  Even back in Camelot, he rarely spoke to me if at all.  

For the most part I believe these random and adventuresome visits we all need from time to time and while we all miss one another a great deal, we all have our separate paths.  Each of them as vital as the roles we played in the past. 

Well I have found myself stuck with wanting to say more but not knowing what to say.
And there is Harry.  

Blessings to all.

I have to fight to the end. 

There is a dream. 
There is a nightmare.
How can they be so much the same?

When the women cry, is it for me?
Mothers lost sons.
Wives' husbans. 

But is it for me?
Just a tool. 
A reason to break the rule. 

I've seen him look at me. 
Hate, how it drips. 

I've locked up tight. 
To  be honest I can't free myself.

<i>Harry.. Harry.. Harry</i>

They all whisper.
Do they hear my plea?
Wraped up in a cloak.
I don't want to be seen. 

I see her honesty.
I can almost reach out and touch. 
This hell is all to much. 

Remember me?
Little boy blue. 
Lost his horn, 
dosen't know what to do. 

Is it you that will hear me?"

about coming out into the open after years of sleeping is knowing that
everything has changed from the last time you have woken. This is
diffent the one thing that breaks me everytime. I sleep so deeply
because I know the moment I wake so does&nbsp; <span style=""font-style: italic;"">he.</span>
This time I wake with in another's body, but it's my body as well. The
feeling of my heart beating loud in my ears the need to feed burning
through out me. I have not and will not for I know that a human's body
could not&nbsp; handle the feeling. Tis even odder waking up while the
person you know as yourself is sitting a desk with something ringing
very loudly. Yes, it scared me.&nbsp; ME! The one who has been fighting
for so long, how my prince would laugh if he knew all it took was a
ringing box to get a start out of me.&nbsp; The sun was pooring in from
the windows. Yes, when I was younger I could take the sun. I enjoyed
feeling wash over my skin. Now, I fear that it just a discomfort.&nbsp;
So the sun was not a blessing to see. It didn't harm me, perhaps it was
then I noticed the heart beat. <br>
<br>
I don't know what to make of this, perhaps I should just allow myself
to wake up slowly. I do wonder if he is out there some where looking
for me. It was times before that he'd always end up at my door. We'd
fight. Mate. Love.&nbsp; And saddly hate.&nbsp; It's the way we are, I
do miss him , however I miss my husband now perhaps a bit more.&nbsp;
It was her music and her little goings on about dark men falling in
love with innocent women .&nbsp; I was innocent when I frist meet him,
I had hardly even kissed my husband to be. It was my Prince's touch
that woke me up.&nbsp; I wonder if I knew what I do now would I had
gone with him instead? I do not know only that I now am missing both my
loves dearly. <br>
<br>
This is why I take up my old pratice of writing in journal even if
this&nbsp; one is a shaired one. I do hope that I can get along with
everyone here. There are old friends in the faces and souls of the
people here, my Lucy is here. Well, she is at work. Sweet sister it's
good to have you near me. I shall not allow him to harm you agian. Thus
as well my hunt for him starts agian. It's a cooling&nbsp; in my blood
then a heat that takes me&nbsp; into his arms that starts it all.
Perhaps this one we can finish it either way. <br>
<br>
The reason why I call this Unnoticeable,&nbsp; it's the way I feel.&nbsp; Perhaps I am acheing for&nbsp; my old friends and him.<br>

Yesterday I was going to be sending time with my husband, he was just
going to take me to a show, an opra(sp?) and we were going to spend
time with out the little ones. I love my children but I needed some
time away and time with Draco. He seemed very happy that I said yes,
well we were sitting in box five! I was over joyed. Because in the play
I love best that box is the one that is imporant. Well, we watched the
play and in the middle something happened. They started singing Think
of me! This is not what the play was. In fact I don't even remember
what the play was. Even better was the fact everyone started to think
of it.. Then Draco sang one part, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">'We never said our love was ever green....</span>'
I love that song but after that one part he got down on one knee! He
asked me to remarry him. I was so over joyed I think I cried my eyes
out. <br>
<br>
Draco had bought out the whole house. It was our friends and family
down below and in other boxes. I was never so happy. I asked him last
time, so he got to wear the Potter name with all the rights. I do add
Malfoy to my name but in wizarding laws its not there because I was the
'groom.' Dear gods I am so bloody happy. After the play we all went to
the Weasleys, I think Molly had to spell the house bigger. I think I
cried to many times. I think our oldest will be flower girl. <br>

At frist I was visiting this place where these priests were living,
they were christien priests. I think I was with a friend whoes son was
one of them. The son was very sweet and kind. Then another sat down. I
asked them what they thought of pagan people, that was a bit
intresting. The son just nodded the other talked wtih me. I felt safe
when the other two people left to talk to that one about my visions. He
went all odd on me telling me that I needed to mate with him. I
screamed ""No, I wont let her be born that way."" Then I ran from the
place, it wasn't a church, not sure what it was. I ended up flaging
down this odd bus I got on and something felt odd, the holy man person
was still coming after me. We went though this tunel thing and ended up
in this land that I know I've seen before. I got off and started having
memories of being there as a child. Then I started speaking in&nbsp;
one of the old tongues, maybe it was Demon. I don't know. All the time
I was suppose to be saving them from something. I think the priest
brought me there for a reason. It hurts and I feel empty. I don't know
what to do. I know I was speaking in my sleep calling out in the tongue
but the boy heard nothing and he was sleeping beside me.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;I was being given things:<br>
<br>
There was a stone.<br>
It was a tear drop, it felt powerfull.<br>
It had green string on it..<br>
<br>
Dark brown on the top then it got lighter until it ended with a
frostest green around the tip on the tip it was black. It was a bit
smooth to the touch. It felt havy it was a large price. The next thing
I was givien was a red hood.<br>
<br>
There was a black cloak and I think I was going to have a staff. So very odd.<br>
<br>
I hate dreaming I really really do. I feel so tired now, but I fear
going back to sleep. I don't know what to do. I want to wake the
Duchess but she'd most likely be mad with me. I think I am going to
rest and send off engery.<br>

Honestly there are alot more then these, Potter's brain is not working.
Most of us here didn't really have a good time with our fathers,
perhaps that is one of the reasons why we were allt hinking about this.
So here where I say who I think my father really lis, given the list
above. The person I am feeling very close with, and it scares me
because it feels like he might not be real, even though I can feel it
in my heart...Bloody hell! I've been hanging around gryffindorks to

Yes, I say ""Happy Father's day to Remus Lupin, James Potter, and Sirius

<lj-cut text=""Harry, sixth year. ""><br>

Dear whom ever is listening,

<br>

I've been thinking about all of these times about how it
feels to be alone. I feel alone in the still of the night. I sit in my
Uncle's house feeling the hate driping from his words, actions and
swiming in those eyes. I can't stand him watching me. It's like he
always doing it. Everyone is always doing it. Why do they hate me so
much? I cried so much when I was younger trying to figure that out. I
always thought it was because I did something very bad. Perhaps I was
the reason&nbsp; my parents died.&nbsp; Was I being fussy in the car
and my dad turned to look at me then boom it happened?<br>
<br>
It turns out ever so rightly that I was the reason why my parents died,
they died because they had to keep me safe, they died because some mad
man wanted to kill me so that I would kill him. My hands already
covered in blood, must I have his as well? I don't like all of this
death, I want to give into the whispers in the lurking dark but I wont.
For I know what color the blood is that will next spill, my own. Some
of them think it's so easy my fight, some of them with their innocent
eyes and smiles look at me to keep the safe when I am only a year or so
in front of them in school. <br>
<br>
Perhaps if I knew all of this was going to happen I'd never had enter
the wizarding world. But I've never been one to allow others to hurt,
well, anyone but myself.&nbsp; Even now I know that I am still doing
it. Still making myself hurt, safe with in these walls of hogwarts with
my friends but inches away from me I feel lonely in my heart. I ache,
feeling like there is something missing.&nbsp; Sirius is gone, my fult
for being so sure of myself. My pride did not soften my fall. I fear
the next time I see Professor Lupin, I fear what the were-wolf will
do.&nbsp; I can still remember him holding me back. If&nbsp; it was
just a second faster I would of grabed him. I could of saved him as he
was saving me. <br>
<br>
I want my godfather, I want the life that I was suppose to be having
right at this moment. I want Dumbeldore and Voldemort just to finely
fuck maybe that would make things better. It's their war if you boil it
all down. They are fight for the power that they both see and don't
know they already have. I can feel my magic flare feel my whole being
scream at night when the dreams come upon me. I want to write to
Voldemort and tell him to screw off, but I love my owl a little to much
for that. <br>
<br>
Can I feel so empty when I am full of pain? I still have Sirius' knife,
its hot in my hands. I've cut myself, once by mistake. Now, there are
no more mistakes. I think Hermione might know, the way she looks at me.
Her heart is broken that only make sit hurt more. Ron is scared to
touch me, I keep whinceing when everyone does. The last person to hold
me was Lupin. I almost want to go to him, like a child scared of a
storm and beg him to hold me. <br>
<br>
But why should he? I couldn't bear if I see him and he doesn't have the
happiness in his eyes. They were so happy, the way they looked at each
other. Sirius, I miss you. I love you. Please forgive me. Mum and Dad I
am so sorry that I couldn't be stronger, please please, take care of
Sirius, he'll be lonely.&nbsp; I don't know if there is a god or a
goddess or many of t hem. My <span style=""font-style: italic;"">family</span> always said God would never listen to a freak like me, but myabe my parents will.<br>
<br>
I better go if I don't get sleep for tomorrow's classes it will only upset Hermione. <br>
<br>
Forgive me,<br>
Harry.<br>

Brithdays are so very imporant, at least in the wizarding world. The
older you get the stronger you get. I never knew this when I was
growing up. I see it now with my own children. But thats not the only
reason why I want to see Neo, I want to wish him a wonderfull brithday.
He's so good to us. It was nice talking to him even though there is so
much more that needs to be said. Happy birthday Neo.<br>
